<doc id="1069869" wikidata="Q191772" url="?curid=1069869" title="Mende, Lozère">
<text>Mende (, ) is a commune and the prefecture of the department of Lozère, in the region of Occitania, Southern France. Its inhabitants are called the &quot;Mendois&quot;. The city, including the first traces of dwellings date back to 200 BC, was originally named &quot;Mimata&quot;, probably in reference to the mountains that surround it.

Mende is located between Clermont-Ferrand and Montpellier, but also on the axis of Lyon–Saint-Étienne–Albi–Toulouse. The other important nearby towns are Aurillac and Saint-Flour (Cantal), Le Puy-en-Velay (Haute-Loire), Rodez, Millau (Aveyron) and Alès and Nîmes (Gard).

Even though Mende remains a relatively sparsely populated city (approximately 12,000 inhabitants), it remains the most important of the Lozère Department. In addition, it is the city-centre of the unique urban area of this department.

It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mende.

==Geography==

===Situation===

Mende is situated in the high valley of the Lot, in a mountainous area, in the &quot;Pays du Gévaudan&quot;, the Rieucros stream joins to it on its right bank. The city is overlooked (on the left bank of the Lot) by and its . Access is by the . On the right bank, residential areas extend over different causses, including the &quot;Causse d&#x27;Auge&quot;. Located on the axis of Lyon-Toulouse, the city has long been a commercial crossroads between the Auvergne, Rhone and the Languedoc.

The commune is bordered by Chastel-Nouvel to the north, Badaroux to the east, Lanuéjols to the southeast, Brenoux and Saint-Bauzile to the south, Balsièges to the southwest, and Barjac and Servières to the west.

Mende is one of the &quot;gateway cities&quot; (along with Millau, Lodève, Alès and Ganges) for the site of the Causses and Cévennes, of world heritage by UNESCO under the inscription &quot;Les Causses and Cevennes, Mediterranean agro-pastoral cultural landscape&quot;.

According to the INSEE, Mende is an urban commune without suburbs (&quot;ville isolée&quot; [isolated town]). It lies at the centre of a functional urban area composed of 31 communes, the only one in the department of Lozère.

===The Causses===
The town of Mende is built in the Lot Valley, within the area of the . The region of the Causses in Lozère is one of the four of Lozère, with the Margeride, the Aubrac and the Cévennes. The city is nestled in the middle of different Causses which form as natural barriers. However, over the 20th century, urbanisation began to extend beyond these limits.

Of the Causses, is the most significant. The causse is overhung by the Cross of . A first wooden cross was planted in 1900 or 1907. It was replaced a few years later, on 8 July 1933, a Jubilee year, by a -high iron cross. Until 1945, this cross was the place of large gatherings in honour of Mendois soldiers. This cross has been illuminated since the summer of 1965. The mount also houses the chapel where Privat, the martyr of the Gévaudan, withdrew to. At its foot lies the area of Vabre where can be found the first remains of houses in the city. Opposite this is the Causse d&#x27;Auge (northeast) and the Causse du Crouzet (northwest), and the Margeride mountains beyond. To the west is Causse de Changefège, located between Mende and Barjac, which complements the borders of the city.

===Geology===
The geology of the city of Mende is very dependent on the surrounding causses and streams that pass through them. The Mont Mimat and the Causse de Changefège are composed of limestone of the &quot;Grands Causses&quot;, thus presenting abrupt edges. The other causses (as well as the butte de Fontanille) are composed of limestone of the &quot;Petits Causses&quot; (without these edges). The Lot Valley is composed of marl. The Valley, in the south of Mende, is full of blue marl, leaving one to presuppose that the marl of the town of Mende would be, in part, of the same origin. Finally, the various streams (the Rieucros) of the causses of the north of the city are lined by mica-schist.

===Hydrology===

The city of Mende was built on the banks of the Lot. But the Lot is not the only presence of water in the city: Indeed, it has several sources (springs), including those of . The most significant of them is located in the Vabre district, close to the first houses. These sources have also often been channeled and feed the underground water system of the city, visible on the surface through numerous fountains and the old wash house. The streets, such as the &quot;Rue du Torrent&quot;, attest to the passage of water from Mont Mimat.

To the north, on the other side of the Lot, the sources are much more distant, but water is present in the stream known as Rieucros.

===Climate===
Mende is subject to an oceanic stream that comes from the Aubrac and Mediterranean and flows from the Cévennes. The department of Lozère, Mende in particular, benefit from insolation (or sunlight) similar to that of Toulouse with approximately 2,069 hours of sunshine per year. The city, away from the mountains that surround it, has a more protected climate than the highlands of Gévaudan: So, average temperatures oscillate between and . With respect to annual precipitation, data for the Lozère is between , depending on the exposure of the regions, with up to 50 days of snow per year.

Between 1971 and 2000, monthly rainfall ranged from (March) and (September).

In more detail, here are some statements in Mende records since 1985:

===Routes and transportation===

Mende is located in the centre of the Lozère department and therefore centralises the roads. The city has rail and air access, but the Lot is not navigable (too shallow) as with all the rivers of the department (except for recreational canoeing, or in rare exceptions for the transport of people such as the crossing of the Tarn towards La Malène).

====Road network====
Mende is located on the , linking Lyon and Toulouse. The road comes from Balsièges to the west and Badaroux to the east. This axis can be reached easily. Haute-Loire and Ardèche are to the east, via Langogne and Aveyron is to the west via La Canourgue-Banassac, as well as the A75 autoroute. A road doubling project is underway in the department, bypassing Mende from the north. This doubling is however a long project (1993), having had several outlines and some opposition. The project was finally abandoned in October 2012 making Lozère a department without draft dual carriageways on RN 88. Indeed, its neighbours Aveyron and Tarn continue their projects of dual carriageways between Rodez and Toulouse with all expected to be commissioned in December 2015. The work of the Rodez - Séverac section should be completed by the end of 2019. The same will be the case for Haute-Loire, which continues its road access. However, the workarounds of Mende and Langogne are budgeted. These projects in adjacent departments will reach major cities nearby to Mende (Rodez, Albi, Toulouse, Le Puy and even Lyon). Finally, the economic impact or the absence of dual carriageways in Lozere must be assessed in the medium and long term.

Furthermore, a viaduct (the Rieucros Viaduct) commissioned in December 2009 will be used to ensure a first bypass of Mende. It connects the industrial area of the Causse d&#x27;Auge to the technological centre of Valcroze (and the RD 42) and also helps to relieve the traffic connecting the districts north and northwest of the city.

The RN 88 deviation from Mende should be the first from Pelouse to reach up to the Causse d&#x27;Auge with an &quot;expressway&quot; configuration. Then it would continue on the D 806 (ex north) to the Rieucros Viaduct, and then a new section of the viaduct to the Mende exit in the hamlet of La Thébaïde (west bypass). These two sections will only be of two lanes. Subsequently, the expressway from the Causse d&#x27;Auge will be directly linked to the A 75.

Another national road, the RN 106, formerly ran through the city. This name is no longer valid for the section coming from the Gard and joining Mende via Florac (it is then of the RN 88 on the stretch between Balsièges and Mende). The northern part of the road was decommissioned in 2007 and now bears the name of D 806. This stretch goes from Mende to Saint-Chély-d&#x27;Apcher (and the A75 autoroute) via Chastel-Nouvel.

Secondary access is provided by the RD 42 from the northwest, which joins the RN 88 at Barjac, and by the RD 25 which, passing through the , crosses before arriving at the Valdonnez.

====Rail network====
Mende features an SNCF railway station, located on the railway line of the , between Le Monastier (the ) and La Bastide - Saint-Laurent-les-Bains (). This line, built at the very beginning of the 20th century, bears the nickname of &quot;ligne du toit de la France&quot; [the roof of France line], and Mende is the main railway station. Ten weekly links are provided by rail.

The station is also the starting point of the TER connection to Clermont-Ferrand by bus, which is daily.

====Urban transport network====
Referred to as TUM (for &quot;Transports Urbains Mendois&quot;) the urban transport network is exclusively equipped with buses, which run through the city and some nearby villages (Les Boulaines, Chabrits, Chabannes). Since its establishment in 2000, it has replaced the school bus service. The urban transport network is also responsible for the management of the pay car parks in the city. A part of the city centre is also exclusively pedestrian.

====Air transport====
The prefecture of the Lozère department shares with the neighbouring village of Brenoux. This airfield, located on , is thus from Clermont-Ferrand, from Montpellier and away from Lyon and Toulouse. Highlights include it being the site of the final scene of the film &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot;, and also of five stages of the Tour de France (1995, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018).

Furthermore, a Mende-Paris air link was implemented in October 2007. However, the flight was departing from the aerodrome of Le Puy-en-Velay, located from Mende and reached by a shuttle. This connection was born of a desire to open up Mende to air travel, which is indeed late at this level for a prefecture, and has no direct flight to Paris unlike its neighbours Clermont-Ferrand, Rodez, Aurillac or Le Puy-en-Velay.

Since the beginning of 2008, a study has been conducted by the CCI of the Lozère department, in order to discuss the possibility of the establishment of a link between the Lozerian prefecture and the regional capital, Montpellier but four years after the launch of this study, no concrete project to date has been presented.

Finally, two more major airports with international influence and close to Mende are Clermont-Ferrand Aulnat and Rodez-Aveyron.

==Urban planning==

===Five historic sections===

In the 13th century, the city was concentrated in what is now the city centre, bounded by the boulevards, and formerly the ramparts. It was then split into five sections (or neighbourhoods) known as &quot;pans&quot;: Auriac, Aygues-Passe, Champnau, Chastel and Claustres.

When it was initially named as such, the Pan d&#x27;Auriac was mainly a place of settlement, before becoming the &quot;quartier des pénitents blancs&quot; [district of the white penitents] who settled there. The Pan d&#x27;Aygues-Passe (or Aigues-Passe), meaning &quot;water that passes&quot;, owes its name to the inclination of its streets, where the water flowed during cleaning. The Pan de Champnau derives its name from &quot;new field&quot;, and includes what was a new residential area, at north of the city. The Pan de Chastel is the old commercial district of the city. It is located towards the Chastel Gate, which led then to Chastel-Nouvel, where a castle stood which was property of the bishops. Finally the Pan des Claustres, whose name comes from cloisters, was the largest of the city and is now between the and , i.e. between the two tombs of (the chapel Saint-Ilpide on the hill of the executioner, and the crypt of Sainte-Thècle under the cathedral square).

===The modern districts of the city===

*The historic centre

The historic city centre is bordered by boulevards which took the place of the ancient walls. In addition to housing, the centre is mostly occupied by convenience stores and artisans. Beyond the boulevards, there are other houses as well as government buildings. The General Council and the prefecture indeed share the former , but services are scattered throughout the city. &quot;Allée Piencourt&quot; connects downtown roads to Badaroux and Chastel-Nouvel, near the ancient diocese (pré claux and pré vival) having been built.

*Mende North (Chaldecoste), the Causse d&#x27;Auge

North of the &quot;Allée Piencourt&quot;, past the Berlière Bridge, dwellings are present at the foot of the Causse d&#x27;Auge. These were established in several instalments over the 19th and 20th centuries, the first of these being Chaldecoste. It is in this part of the city that the large and the small seminary as well as the Convent of Carmel are found. The city extends to the north in the direction of Alteyrac (commune of Chastel-Nouvel). Between these areas and Alteyrac is located the zone of economic activities (ZAE) of the Causse d&#x27;Auge. The northern districts often bear names of flowers, this part of the city that historically sheltered gardens and vineyards, along the draille linking the &quot;Plateau du Palais du Roi&quot; [King&#x27;s Palace Plateau].

The causse is bounded by two streams, the Rieucros in the east and the to the west.

*Fontanilles

Above the Badaroux road, on a hill, lies the Fontanilles district. It was originally social housing. At the foot of the hill is the Lycée Notre-Dame, while beyond the district of Saint-Laurent (where one finds traces of history with the presence of a chapel and a windmill) and, later, the Gardès ZAE. In this part, to the west of Gardès, is also the village of Sirvens where traces of a Gallo-Roman villa were discovered.

*Mende South, Mont Mimat

Stuck between Fontanille, Mont Mimat and the city centre, are districts located roadside above pré claux. In this area are located the centre of firefighters, the Château of Bellesagne and the former gendarmerie. The market is also in this area, but more to the east than the precedents cited (beyond the boulevards, however). Above it lies the Vabre district and Hill of the Executioner where the first traces of dwellings of the city were found. Also nearby is the city&#x27;s prison.

*Le Chapitre and the road to Chabrits

In the westerly direction, found the District of Le Chapitre with the sports complex and the holiday village. This area is at the foot of a portion of the Causse de Changefège, where homes are installed along the Chabrits road (&quot;Avenue du 11-Novembre&quot;, north-west of the city). It is in this part of the city which the district of Valcroze is found (new in the 19th century), the Chabrits ZAE and technology park.

*Balsièges road

The other side of the Lot, along the , is found the avenue of the Gorges du Tarn and the area of Ramille. It is in this part where retail establishments are found. The Ramille zone saw the introduction, despite some criticism about the instability of the ground, of the hypermarket of the department, as well as a commercial area.

===City map===
On the map are the main roads of the city. To the west, the RN 88 is joined to Balsièges, passing through the Rocher de Moïse (classified site) located at the left end. To the northwest, it is the hamlet of Chabannes, and further to Chabrits. To the south, is found, where the new cross stands which symbolically marks the top of the hill (although it continues a little higher). This road leads to the Hermitage of , at the cross of the same name and the route of Valdonnez (Lanuéjols, Brenoux, Saint-Bauzile).

To the east, Fontanille district is on a hillock, circumvented by the Lot. Behind lies the district of Saint-Laurent, then the ZAE de Gardès (and the village of the same name) and the village of Sirvens. Following the RN 88, one reaches Badaroux. Finally to the north, is the area of the Chaldecoste (broken down into several districts: Bergerie, Chanteperdrix, Vignette, etc.) where one can reach the ZAE du causse d&#x27;Auge. Further to the north, one finds Chastel-Nouvel before returning to the ground of and the &quot;Plateau du Palais du Roi&quot;. The drinking water of the city of Mende comes from this direction, because of the Lac de Charpal reservoir, which is the main source.

===Housing===
In 2017, Mende had 6,851 residences for an official population of 12,134 people. 87% of them are primary residences and 6.1% of secondary residences, which contrasts sharply with the figure of the Lozère department amounting to a 32.3% share of secondary housing.

The population has been growing for several years, and the city has acquired new quarters over the years: Chaldecoste and Chanteperdrix in the 1970s, La Bergerie in the 1990s, and Valcroze in the 2000s. The city has 17.9% of HLM-type accommodations.

59% of dwellings have four rooms or more and 19% have three rooms. The city is composed of many individual homes, small and large dwellings remaining in the minority. However, one can see that between 1990 and 1999 there was an increase of 85.3% of dwellings of one or two rooms. This can partly be explained by the development of higher education, with the branch of the University of Perpignan.

==Toponymy==
The region is an ancient site of settlement dating back to the Bronze Age, although the capital of the Gévaudan, the Gallic period then Gallo-Roman, was Anderitum. Found in the ancient texts are the names of &quot;Mimate&quot;, &quot;Mimata&quot; (mountain), which refer to this town at the foot of &quot;Mons Mimatensis&quot; (). In the same spirit, another name circulating is that of &quot;Viculus Mimatensis&quot; (or &quot;Vicus Mimatensis&quot;). It is the city which gave its name to Mont Mimat (&quot;mount of the Mendois&quot;, literally) and not vice versa.

==History==

===Gallo-Roman era===

Traces of dwellings dating from 200 BC were found, ancient Roman &quot;villae&quot;, as well as around the city. However, residents could have been be domiciled here well before. Indeed, on Mont Mimat to Chapieu, a dolmen was found around 1913 including a trepanned skull. The other surrounding plateaux also attest this presence with other dolmens (on the Causse de Changefege for example). These remains may date from the Chalcolithic period.

The city, strictly speaking, dates from the Middle Ages, and it is not found cited at the end of the 6th century by Gregory of Tours in his &quot;Histoire des Francs&quot;. This text speaks of the martyrdom of , the first bishop of the Gabali, who was the origin of a pilgrimage to the hermitage and the caves where he had retired. Mende in the 3rd century was then only a village. The history of Privat is thus situated around the 3rd century, while he was sent by Austromoine to evangelize the Gévaudan. It was during this period that the Alemanni invaded the country, guided by their leader, Chrocus.

The Gabali took refuge in the fortress of Grèzes where they were under siege for two years. Their bishop, Privat, was meanwhile in one of the caves of Mont Mimat which he had converted into a hermitage. When Chrocus learned that the bishop was not among his people, he went looking for him to use as a hostage in order to get the Gabali to leave Grèzes. Privat was martyred at his cave on near the village of Mimate. Presented to the Gabali, he refused to deliver his people despite all the barbaric tortures to which he was subjected (according to Gregory of Tours: &quot;The good shepherd refused to deliver his sheep to wolves, and they tried to force his to sacrifice to demons&quot;). Exhausted, the Alemanni would leave the Gabali free, by promising them peace. Privat succumbed to his injuries in the following days. His act of resistance, refusing to deliver his compatriots, thus earned him great popular fervour, and it was around his tomb and his hermitage that pilgrimage began, allowing the village to grow.

===Middle Ages===

In the 12th century Gévaudan was part of the County of Barcelona. In Mende, the counties have a castle, the castel frag. Three other lords had their castle around the Romanesque church: That of Canilhac (who owned the archtreasurer rights of the church), that of Cabrières (who was granted rights of archdeacon) and Dolan (who administered and ruled the episcopal home during the interregnum of bishops). In 1161, Mende, who was under the suzerainty of the King of France, saw his Bishop get the royal rights. It was the golden bull, an act signed by the king and marked with a royal seal in gold, which contained the terms of this agreement. It thus gave Aldebert and his successors, in perpetuity, the Royal power and the full powers of justice on the inhabitants of the bishopric. This fact is quite rare because only four golden bulls in six centuries were granted by the Kings of France.

It was from this time that the city walls were built. Aldebert wished to protect the city and secure channels that lead there. he recovered and also built the fortress of Chapieu on , and was done so that it could accommodate a garrison. This allowed the monitoring of the direct route between Mont Lozère and Villefort, in other words towards the Regordane Way, trade route.

At that time, however, Mende was not provided the civil and religious capital of Gévaudan. In fact the power was always dependent of two entities: The county and Viscount of Grèzes. The Viscount, property of the King of Aragon, was recovered by the King of France in 1258. The bishop had great power as a vassal, but he didn&#x27;t have the total legitimacy of some Royal officials. This situation ended from 1307 with the Act of paréage between Bishop Guillaume VI Durand and King Philip IV. Indeed, it definitively fixed the possessions of the king and those of the bishop, even if some disputes persisted.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War security increased with the strengthening of the fortifications and the construction of ditches to 1361-1362. At that time, the chapter of Mende had a castle on the heights of the city, Chastel-Nouvel. In 1370 many locals felt safe from the ramparts of the city, despite threats from the routiers. Also, few of them took refuge in Chastel-Nouvel. But the walls were insufficient, and could not prevent the pillages. This period isolated Mende from its neighbours, including Le Puy-en-Velay, and waited the arrival of the Constable of France, Bertrand du Guesclin, then the intervention of Charles VI and the liberation of the region so that the roads reopened around 1452.

In 1390, was in Mende, where John III of Armagnac sought, on behalf of the King of France, to put an end to the private war that Raymond de Turenne led against the Pope from Avignon. The Gascon signed as a witness to an agreement between the legate of Clement VII, Antoine de Lisa, , and a representative of the Viscount of Turenne. This interview of Mende helped the Florentines to send ambassadors to solicit the Count of Armagnac. He was proposed to cross the Alps and attack the Count of Vertus in Lombardy.

It was also at this time that Pope Urban V began the work of the cathedral (1368), for a completion in 1467. By its letters patent, King Louis XI confirmed the privileges for this cathedral, granted by his predecessors, in September 1464.

At the beginning of the 1470s, conflict erupted between Bishop and King Louis XI, because of the support that the bishop had given to the County of Armagnac when it had revolted. To counter it, the king subtracted La Panouse authority over the city which then became autonomous. It wasn&#x27;t until 1478 that the bishops found authority over the city, sharing revenues with the consul.

At the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Mende developed its production of drapery, and thus increased its role as a commercial crossroads between the Languedoc and Auvergne, exporting its fame. It is estimated that in the 16th century Mende was one of the richest dioceses of Languedoc before Montpellier and Toulouse. This wealth of the diocese reinforced the ecclesiastical power. Thus among the list of the bishops of the time one can count a number from the family of the Pope. Giuliano della Rovere was ordained bishop of Mende, although he never visited in the capital of Gévaudan (practice known as commendation). His nephews, Clement and , succeeded him in this position. During his tenure, François adorned the cathedral with its bell towers, which one hosted the &quot;Non Pareille&quot;, the largest bell in the world.

In October 1485, when Clement de La Rovere came to the episcopal seat, old quarrels between the consul and the bishopric re-emerged, first mentioned with fear of losing this privilege. Thus they barricaded the gates of Mende, so that the bishop could not access. At this time the bishops primarily used their Balsièges Castle as a residence (that of Chanac being the summer residence). In vain as the Della Rovere family covered the full authority by notice of the king in 1492. The title of consul was held in place of the traditional title of trustee.

===Renaissance===

In the 16th century, the main events were the Reformation and the Wars of Religion which resulted. On 21 July 1562, 4,000 Protestants got within the walls of the city. They destroyed the unprotected monuments and besieged the city by depriving it of water. They withdrew four days later, largely due to being given 2,000 ecus. This ransom ensured the city a few years of peace.

During the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, Astorg de Peyre was murdered in the king&#x27;s room: his widow then hired a young man, Matthieu Merle to avenge the death of her husband. From 1569 to 1576 he held with his troops the fortress of Grèzes where he gradually seized the north of Gévaudan. From 1577 he moved with his troops to Marvejols intending to seize Mende, although not ceasing his conquests to the north, he failed however in August 1578 at Saint-flour. The night of Christmas 1579, to enter the city, Merle&#x27;s soldiers waited until the people of Mendes were at midnight mass, and made their takeover of the city. According to one account, Merle&#x27;s soldiers &quot;seized the city by betrayal and massacred 400 priests or followers, most of them within the walls itself, of the cathedral.&quot;

During his stay in Mende, Merle made further fortification to the city, not hesitating razing 120 homes to restore the ramparts. In February 1581, while he ruled all the Gévaudan, he enforced the threat he had made to the people. He had in fact asked them to deliver 4,000 ecus, a sum that the Mendois could not collect. He partially destroyed Mende Cathedral built by Pope Urban V. He saved a bell tower to avoid damaging the episcopal palace where his home was established. It was at this time that the &quot;Non Pareille&quot; was melted, the biggest bell in the world, to manufacture culverins and other cannonballs. The city was liberated on bail that year thanks to the intervention of the King of Navarre.

The city liberated, a seneschal was created to ensure the peace. Response to the attack of Merle was organised in 1586 against the town of Marvejols, led by baron de Saint-Vidal. It was during this response that the Peyre fortress disappeared from the rock of Peyre. The seneschal took its place. The Tower of Auriac, today known as the Tower of Penitents, was built to accommodate one hundred soldiers. The seneschal gradually took precedence over the diocese, which called for the help of the Duke of Languedoc in 1597. It was after this episode that the Seneschal of Mende disappeared.

===From the 17th century to the French Revolution===

The beginning of the 17th century was coloured by the work of reconstruction of the cathedral for an inauguration in 1605, although work had lasted until 1629. Far from the splendour of the original, while taking up the same plane, this new cathedral was characterised by a bell tower which was smaller than the other.

Between 1645 and 1660, the city was the scene of strife between two rival factions: The Marmaux and the Catharinaux, all members of the consuls or the bourgeoisie, but not having the same opinion on the importance of episcopal power, the latter being opposed. The bishop was also the target of an attack while he officiated in Mende Cathedral in 1645 (he was actually not touched). After several trials, it was not without difficulty that the kingdom gave back his ancestral power, the consul remaining under his control.

At the end of the century, landscaped a lane which joined to the Lot (since known as &quot;Allée Piencourt&quot;) and especially acquired the Aubusson tapestries for the episcopal palace. These tapestries, classified, since adorn the cathedral. It was also behind the early educational development in the city and contributed to the building of the hospital. It also made the hospital its heir, allowing it to develop.

In 1702, the war of the Camisards was triggered in the Cévennes. Mende somewhat landscaped its walls in order to prevent any attack. However, this war which began with the murder of Father du Chayla at Le Pont-de-Montvert never reached Mende.

In 1721, the Great Plague arrived in Gévaudan affecting the town of Mende with an amount of 1,078 victims in one year. Two generations later, the walls were removed (in 1768), &quot;so the air circulates better&quot;.

Once all these troubles passed, the city redeveloped its economy around wool and sheep farming. The city extended a little bit under the development of the appearance of the mills, and its first factory. In 1754, Mende saw Louis Mandrin the famous brigand, who lodged in a house there and, according to legend, hid treasure.

Between 1764 and 1767, Mende was the witness the comings and goings of the wolf-hunters of the king, who came to seek rest in the city before returning to hunt the beast which was terrorising the north of the country. It was seen close to Mende, once at Pailhou and between Rieutort-de-Randon and Chastel-Nouvel but remained primarily in Margeride. At this time the quarrel between the consul and the bishop was brought up to date by the edict on municipal organizations. The burghers and nobles opposed, but the bishop finally retained power in 1771.

During the French Revolution, Mende had to share with Marvejols the function of department capital of Gévaudan. This was renamed in the Lozère department in 1790, and the guardianship of the church disappeared in 1791, thus putting an end to the paréage of 1307. Mende was the scene of small counter-revolutionary clashes, but without great effects. It became the sole capital shortly after.

===Since the 19th century===


In 1800, the prefect settled in the city, and the prefecture occupies the episcopal palace after the sale of the property of the church. In the middle of the 19th century, the causses around Mende are planted with Austrian black pine, this national forest has continued since then. The choice of black pine was due to its ease of acclimation, and its robustness. The presence of this forest often protected Mende from floods.

Then the railway appeared in the prefecture, then linking to Sévérac-le-Château (3 May 1884). The railway line follows the Lot to cross the city, and also continues to follow, like the newly created road. In 1887 the old episcopal palace disappeared in flames, the prefecture had to be rebuilt.

On 8 April 1888 Mende became one of the first cities in France, and the first chef-lieu to have electric lighting. The plant was installed in the old .

The twentieth century was marked by a beginning of economic decline. The gradual end of the wool industry, the First and the Second World War depopulated the city. Between 1931 and 1934 baths are built, since becoming the Home, and located on the market square. The building was destroyed in summer 2013, to be replaced by a multi-cultural hall.

In 1939, shortly before World War II, an internment camp was built in the woods of the Rieucros. The population was opposed to this transit camp for anti-fascists and communists. It then became an internment camp exclusively for women. The mayor at the time, , condemned the Vichy regime and the camp in his hometown, where he made sure that children interned with their mother followed a normal education. His hostile words and acts to the regime in place led him to be removed from his post in 1941. He then joined Resistance where he became one of the leaders for the Lozère. Arrested and sent to German camps in 1944, he died during a transfer in 1945.

Ideally placed between the Maquis of the Cévennes and the Aubrac, the town was located as well as a centre for the coordination of the Lozère Interior Resistance. As for the population, it protected itself where shelters against aerial bombardments were implemented.

From the 1970s, the city had a sizable population growth. The city then extended to the Causse d&#x27;Auge. In the 1980s and 1990s, one can also see that the department was depopulating overall, while its prefecture was expanding. Culture and sport took more importance in the life of the city.

During the 1990s, the city developed administrative reconciliations with nearby cities. Therefore, it formed the Estelle city network with Aurillac and Rodez. The principle of the network was to share experiences and pool resources to develop such medium-sized cities. Shortly after, it was with other networks that Mende became closer to other cities of the Massif Central. This is the case, for example, with the Cyber Massif network dedicated to the digital opening up of the region.

Moreover, since the beginning of the 21st century, Mende had tried to actively participate in the policies of opening up of the Massif Central. The city lies in the Lot Valley and reached an area of in the 2000s. It also seeks to enroll in a sustainable development project, in the image of the department with, among other projects, the construction of a cogeneration plant and the establishment of a network of heat. The timber industry, so important in the economy of the city, could therefore be put to further use. The establishment of bio-energy in the city has also been carried out by the appearance of a wind farm north of the city.

==Politics and administration==
Mende is the chef-lieu of the Lozère department: It welcomes in this regard the prefecture and the headquarters of the General Council. The buildings of these two institutions are scattered within the city. A project of the Department Hall to consolidate all services of the General Council is under consideration. The mayor&#x27;s office is housed in the town hall which dates from the 18th century, however, a large part of the services have been moved to the annex of the mayor&#x27;s office.

===City hall===
This is the old consular house which was used as a city hall of the Revolution until 1852. On that date, Mayor Becamel bought the Pages family mansion located in the &quot;Place d&#x27;Angiran&quot;. Since then the city hall has been based in this city mansion (listed historical monument) in the square which has become &quot;Place Charles-de-Gaulle&quot;, although a part of the services is now located in the annex which faces it. As the cathedral, the city hall also houses the tapestries of Aubusson, classified since 1909.

===Political trends and results===

===List of mayors===
Since 1945, the following were elected mayors of the city of Mende:
===Intercommunality===

The city of Mende belongs to the . It was created in December 2001 under the name of &quot;Communauté de communes de la Haute Vallée d&#x27;Olt&quot; before changing its name in 2009. The commune being the largest in terms of population, it was its mayor, Jean-Jacques Delmas, who became the first president of the community.

The implementation of this community of communes has allowed a transfer of powers. So, all areas of economic activity and sports facilities now fall under the responsibility of the community, rather than the commune itself.

However, the actions are much wider since waste treatment also enters the competence of the community. The waste disposal site of the commune lies in the ZAE du Causse d&#x27;Auge, north of the city. In this context, unsorted collection is also the responsibility of the community of communes.

This community of communes is not the only grouping of communities for the town of Mende. A comprehensive plan was implemented around the label &quot;Pays d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire de Mende et Lot en Gévaudan&quot; [Lands of art and history of Mende and Lot in Gevaudan]. These are twenty-two communes which now belong to the Pays d&#x27;Art [Lands of Art] which comes in the continuity of the city of art and history label which Mende has had since 1981. The lands comprises four communities: Cœur de Lozère, , and , which is assistant to the Chastel-Nouvel commune.

===Administrative division===
The city is the chef-lieu of two cantons: Mende-1 and Mende-2 since 2015. Mende-1 comprises the northern part of the city, Mende-2 the southern part.
===Courts===
Before the Act of paréage of 1307, Mendoise and Gevaudanaise justice was fully devolved to the bishops. This power was shared with the king after the signing of the Act. Power was shared between the various for the communal land, with Mende being in the land of the bishops and Marvejols in lands of the king, and like this until 1789.

The courthouse was built between 1833 and 1835. On 18 February 1994, it was the target of a bombing by the FLNC.

The tribunal groups together a children&#x27;s tribunal, a tribunal of commerce, a court and a high court. It depends on the .

The city has long held prisons. Current prison was commissioned in 1891. One of the first high-security areas of France was then moved there in 1949. It was at this date that the prison ownership changed, from the State Department. Several personalities have stayed here, the most famous being Jacques Mesrine. André Génovès&#x27; film, &quot;Mesrine&quot; released in 1983, also tells of the criminal plan to destroy the QHS. had sought to bring Jacques Mesrine out of prison when he was imprisoned in Mende. This area had also been the target of critics, such as those of the Committee of action of prisoners and Serge Livrozet, in 1975. In 1989, the Mende detention centre was again publicised with the escape of , who managed to escape by threatening guards with a dummy gun. The last prison &#x27;personality&#x27; of Mende, , activist of the alongside José Bové, was imprisoned after the case of the McDonald&#x27;s franchise destruction in Millau.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Mende is twinned with:
* Wunsiedel, Germany (1980)
* Volterra, Italy (1993)
* Vila Real, Portugal (2003)

Since 2007, the cities of Wunsiedel and Volterra are also paired together. The twinning with Vila Real (much more populous than the city of Mende) is explained by the fact that a large part of the Portuguese population of Mende, and Lozère in general, is from this region.

==Population and society==

===Demographics===

====Demographic evolution====
In contrast to the department of Lozère, the prefecture saw its demographic curve draw increasingly since the French Revolution. If the department was strongly affected by the and the great wars of the 20th century, the city had the presence of its own authorities. This may explain why Mende has not experienced the same trend as Lozère. This table shows the demographic for the town of Mende, but it can be considered that the &quot;bassin Mendois&quot; [Mende area] follows the same trend.

In 2017, the commune had 12,134 inhabitants.

====Age structure====
The Mende population is fairly young taking into account the ageing population of Lozère. Compared with the 1990 census, it is the age group of 15–29 years which has had the greatest increase at the expense of those aged 0–14 and 30–44 years. The number of near-centenarians was also greater in 1999 than in 1990.

====Immigration====
In Mende, the share of the immigrant population represents about 8% of the total population. They originate mostly from Portugal (mainly from Vila Real), Morocco, Algeria, and Turkey. This being the image of immigration in the region. The Spanish immigration, which was very present in the middle of the twentieth century, has been disappearing since the 1970s.

===Education===

Mende has three nursery schools: &quot;Solelhons&quot; (the small Suns in Occitan), the Chênes school and Fontanilles school. They are in close relations with the primary schools of the Groupe solaire, Annex Michel del Castillo School and Fontanilles School, Jeanne d&#x27;Arc School dealing with private education.

The public college of Henri-Bourillon is located in the former small seminary, and share places with the Lycée Chaptal. It hosts students from the city as well as a number from other neighbouring municipalities (Badaroux, Barjac, Chanac, Saint-Bauzile, Saint-Étienne-du-Valdonnez, etc.). The private college is the college of . The continuity of private education is at the Lycée Notre-Dame. Another high school, the Lycée Emile Peytavin allows, in addition to general education, technical and vocational education. Finally, now attached to the Lycée Notre-Dame, we find the Private Professional Lycée Plaisance.

Institutions of the city are also have one of the best success rates for the Baccalauréat diploma, compared with the other schools in the area, which puts them in the first half best institutions of France.

At the level of higher education, Mende welcomes a BTS in its different high schools. An , branch of the University of Perpignan, offers four courses: Multimedia, gerontology, City Council Secretary, and tourism. It is located in the buildings of the former Lamolle barracks, which had housed the . Finally the city also houses a teacher training Institute, an (IFSIL), a and a .

===Cultural events and festivities===

The festivities of the town of Mende are held annually in the month of August. They were related to the feast of , on 21 August. They are decorated with a flower parade and the election of &quot;Miss Mende&quot;. Then, in September, every other year, Mende hosts its beer festival, with its twin town of Wunsiedel. The city has also several sports events. At the cultural level, the &quot;meetings of writers&quot; were organized at the beginning of the 1990s, in August. They have welcomed regional authors but also renowned authors such as Calixthe Beyala and Michel Folco.

===Health===

The department has a hospital, which opened in 1970. Five of the six services are located in Mende: Guy de Chauliac Hospital, the retirement home, the convalescence centre, the Training Institute in Nursing and boarding school. The sixth branch, another retirement home, is based at Rieutort-de-Randon.

The hospital has approximately 70 physicians and 750 health professionals. Moreover, since 2011, it welcomes in its structure the home of the Paul Éluard psychological and psychiatric unit, a branch of the of Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole.

To this one can add 20 physicians, general practitioners and specialists as well as a centre of firefighters. Though, if the implementation of the current hospital is fairly recent, the city has a fairly old hospital story.

In the 12th century was the &quot;alms house&quot; for the population. This hospital, located on &quot;Rue Angiran&quot;, derived its income from the operation of a mill in the district of La Vernède, as well as donations of the lords of the lands. It was partially destroyed in 1593 during the construction of a nearby citadel. Though the citadel disappeared in 1597, the hospital was not repaired immediately. From 1635 a budget was allocated for the rebuilding of the institution. It would not be built in the same place, and would take the name of &quot;Hospital of Aygues-Passes&quot;. In 1677 became and thus Count of Gévaudan. In his first year as bishop, he rebuilt a new hospital which became the &quot;general hospital&quot;. In 1702 it enlarged, and at his death he bequeathed it all of his possessions. This hospital, today the Piencourt residence, remained in use until the inauguration of the hospital. Added to this hospital, two establishments existed following periods of epidemics, both which were outside the city. A plague centre, referred to as &#x27;House of God&#x27;, was established in the district of Janicot. At the Saint-Jean Bridge (now Pont-Roupt), a &quot;maladrerie&quot; was rebuilt in 1242, intended for the accommodation of lepers.

===Sports===
Mende is, by its number of licensees and all events, a sports town. Therefore, she was elected twice the by the daily newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; (1988 and 1998) and a finalist in 2011. It is one of only a few cities of France to have achieved this distinction twice.

====Facilities====

Mende features a sports zone known as the &quot;Complexe sportif de Jean Jacques Delmas&quot; [Sports complex of Jean Jacques Delmas], in honour of his death, having been originally of this project he was the mayor of Mende for 25 years. There are 3 football/rugby pitches (the Stade du Chapitre and 2 training grounds), the semi-Olympic pool, tennis courts, a fitness room, a skate-park, a street-ball court, table-tennis hall and archery/shooting. It is in this complex which the &#x27;&quot;Festival of sport&quot; takes place every two years. Chapitre Stadium, enlarged at the Mediterranean Games has 500 seats, but this figure may be largely surpassed during some matches.

Installed on the causse d&#x27;Auge are three soccer/rugby fields and an athletics track, which came to replace the old track of Mirandol. The Stade de Mirandol had the municipal stadium office until the 1980s. Since 2006, an equestrian centre is also located on the causse, it comes in addition to the aging Sirvens centre located at the exit of the city. Finally, the causse d&#x27;Auge was the chosen site, in 2008, for the construction of a new gymnasium, opposite the football fields.

 offers a freestyle park, many hiking, mountain biking and running trails, a jogging track and a football field. On the Lot, since 1983, a canoe base has been developed in order to practice several water sports.

Near the Chaptal Lycée and the Henri Bourrillon College is the La Vernède complex. In this area are two gymnasiums, a dojo, a gymnastics Hall, one dance, one climbing (over an area outdoors), a covered petanque pitch and one outdoors. Before the construction of the gymnasium of La Vernède, this place was that of the municipal swimming pool and two tennis courts.

Close to other educational institutions, other gyms are installed. There are six in all in the city: La Vernède, Lycée Notre-Dame, Piencourt, Lycée Chaptal, Lycée Théophile Roussel and college Saint-Privat.

====Sports clubs====

Many clubs share the facilities of the city. Football club Éveil Mendois evolved in CFA2 during two seasons (2000–01 and 2001–02), its successor, AF Lozère, plays in the (6th division). The Éveil Mendois football club came from the of the same name, founded in 1920. One of the highlights of its history remains a finish in the last 32 of Coupe de France final played opposite Angoulême on 24 January 1999. More recently, Mende moved up to the last 16 of the finals at the 2013 Coupe de France, winning on this occasion the &quot;ranking of the Petits Poucets&quot;.

The key club is the (formerly Mende Volley Ball) which plays in the Elite division, for the season 2014-2014 (3rd national division). At the top level, the MVL has a title of obtained at the end of the 2008-2009 season and a participation in the third round of the 2010-2011 Coupe de France.

Of Rugby union (&quot;Rugby Club Mende Lozère&quot;), it found its place in Fédérale 3 in 2006, but returned to the regional level in the 2010s. The club however already evolved to a higher level a few years previously.

The handball team (&quot;Mende Gévaudan Club&quot;) is evolving in 2014-2015 in the National 3 France Championship. Finally, the basketball team (&quot;basketball Causses Mendois&quot;) was found in 2014-2015 at the regional level. For women there are also handball, volleyball and basketball clubs which are Mendois clubs of highest level.

Mende can be granted a special status to orienteering, an individual sport with team competitions. The fact remains that Mende is playing in the elite league of France, and &quot;M. G. C. Pétanque&quot; and its three veteran champions of France in 2007.

Sports diversity does not stop there. Mende clubs also include roller hockey (&quot;Les Comets&quot;). Mende is also home to individual sports: Athletics, badminton, cycling, motorcycling, as well as many combat sports clubs.

Since the beginning of the 2000s, a sports centre was set up to accompany young high school athletes to prepare for the best level. From the membership of the COL (centre omnisports Lozère), there is (France MTB 2010 downhill champion) and Fanny Lombard (Junior Champion of Europe 2009 and 2010 in the same discipline).

====Top athletes====

Among professional sportspeople born in Mende, is the road cyclist Christophe Laurent who shone by winning the jersey for the best climber of the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir and the Tour of California.

The motorcyclist , winner of the prologue of the Paris-Dakar Rally (1991), also hails from Mende. He was one of the best enduro riders with the palmares of France, and was also vice World champion.

Kayaker Brigitte Guibal, Olympic silver medallist in 2000 in Sydney, was also born in Mende.

It is in 1988 that Marion Buisson was born in Mende. After making her athletics debut at the &quot;Éveil mendois&quot;, she continued her career at Clermont athletics. She became champion of France in the pole vault in , thereby achieving the minimum to participate in the Beijing Summer Olympics.

====Sporting events====

Each year, the , an enduro competition, centres its course on the city of Mende. This race is part of the most renowned of the enduro season and allows, in addition, mixing professional and amateur riders.

One month later (July), the city centre is dedicated to foot racing and the arrival of . This race starts from Marvejols, joining Mende by the Col de Goudard and the Côte de Chabrits. It is sometimes used as a preparation marathon for major events (the World Championships, Olympic Games), but is also open to amateurs as the majority of the marathons. Since 2006, the month of July is also marked by the organisation of a national of pétanque.

Cycling is also in honour of the city. The hosted the best professionals in the 1970s. Since then, the has seen five stage finishes in the Tour de France (1995, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018), and stages in the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir, the Grand Prix du Midi Libre, the and Paris-Nice. Since 2006 and the rebirth of the Tour du Gévaudan, Mende is judged the final arrival of this amateur race of great importance. In 2008, the event was organised as the &quot;Finale de la Coupe des France des clubs&quot; [final of the Cup of France for clubs]. During the winter, a grand prix of regional cyclo-cross is also organized. The grand departure of the Tour de France VTT 1996, as well as the first two stages, happened at Mende.

Mende was also host city of the Mediterranean Games in 1993 by hosting cycling, football, and swimming events.

In October 2005, the city hosted the 37th national congress of the French hiking federation, Lozère being a popular department for hikers, and is crossed by two of the most important roads of the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Then, in 2007, Mende was the host of a round of the French enduro championships, as well as the final of the Coupe de France rally.

In 2008, France welcomed the enduro European grand prix, the final of the World Championship (WEC). It was the town of Alès which was chosen to host the competition. However the organization was forced to give up, and it was finally hosted by Mende on 11 and 12 October 2008. In 2011, the city hosted the Grand Prix of France, final of the World Championship.

===Media===
Mende is the seat of most of the media of Lozére. Thus we find the writings of the Lozère edition of &quot;Midi Libre&quot; and [New Lozère], with regard to the written press.

The radio station France Bleu and have their editorial offices in Lozère. While Radio Eaux-Vives Lozère is installed at the former Grand Seminary.

===Worship===



The town of Mende is the episcopal seat of Gévaudan and Lozère, religious life has always been linked with its bishops. Also chapter headquarters, Mende has welcomed a large number of canons. A religious brotherhood, the &quot;Brotherhood of the White Penitents&quot; has long existed and has a procession every Holy Thursday since the 17th century. The Tower of the Penitents (called so because it is adjacent to the chapel of the penitents) is one of the last vestiges of the ramparts of the city.

The large and small seminaries are traces of the presence of the formation of Catholic priests.

The main place of worship is the Cathedral of Notre-Dame and Saint-Privat, built at the request of Pope Urban V, in place of the old church built over the tomb of but the city has many small chapels. One of the oldest is the chapel of Saint-Ilpide, on the hill of the executioner, which however was destroyed and replaced by a small chapel. Two other chapels are no longer used: That of the Penitents (future Museum of Religious Art) and the Chapel of Saint-Dominique (exhibition hall). The Chapel of the Hermitage (on ) and the cave which was drilled alongside, can still be used for offices.

The Carmelite convent has existed since 1880 and has hosted a community of Carmelite nuns, which ensures production of altar bread (or wafers) for the diocese (and those nearby). Another Convent is installed in Mende, which is the Adoration of Picpus Convent. At the &quot;Rue de la Chicanette&quot; is installed the Jeanne Delanoue community of the Providence; little used for celebration services, the place is used for meetings between people in the religious world. The community is at the origin of the creation of the institution Notre-Dame-de-la-Providence, a social children&#x27;s home adjacent to its premises and which hosts minors under administrative and judicial protection. There are of other religious communities, mainly related to private schools and retirement or rest homes.

Worship in Mende, due to its history, is very oriented towards Catholicism, but there are other places of worship for other religions. Thus Mende, near of the Cévennes, has a Protestant temple installed in the &quot;Allée Paul Doumer&quot;.

The city also had a synagogue in the former Jewish quarter, but it has long since been abandoned. This synagogue, also called Ferrier House from the name of one of its former owners, is the last vestige of the Mende ghetto. The Jews were expelled from the Gévaudan in the 14th century, and this synagogue became the (Catholic) college of All Saints until the French Revolution.

Whilst counting the presence of a Muslim community, the city has no mosque, but simply an apartment that serves as place of worship.

==Economy==
Industrial (wood industry, jewelry), service centre (shops, restaurants, bars), administrative (generates a lot of jobs) and tourism (medieval town, excursions to Gorges du Tarn), Mende is the starting point for the establishment of new businesses in the department, and turned more towards new technologies, with the advent of the technological hub.

The city has more than 1300 companies, including about 900 in the commercial sector, and has an unemployment rate of 10.7% (2017).

===Zones of activities===
The city has five zones of economic activities (ZAE), each having a rather clearly defined role. The largest is the ZAE of the Causse d&#x27;Auge (north of the city), with a mainly industrial orientation in automation or in the management of the wood. The ZI of Gardès, on the road to Badaroux is an industrial area covering public works and mainly the building companies. The ZAE Lou Chaousse and Chabrits (both in the northwest) also have a vocation craft, but more oriented towards the trade for individuals. And finally, the &quot;Pôle lozérien d&#x27;économie numérique&quot; (POLeN) is turned to the new technologies.

In addition, since the mid-2000s, the de Ramille was created. This area, wedged between the Lot and the RN 88 on the road to Balsièges hosts a commercial zone which has tended to develop. It is without doubt, with the area of the Causse d&#x27;Auge, the area of activity that has extended most recently.

In the near future a new area of activity should emerge north of Mende, in the commune of Badaroux. This area whose size is expected to reach approximately initially, would be served by the landscaped expressway.

===The agricultural past===
If the commune no longer has many farms, the city remains at the centre of a very rural area and is very oriented towards agriculture. Indeed, 54% of the Lozère territory is classified as a &quot;utilised agricultural area&quot;. Livestock in the commune is mainly dedicated to the sheep sector, although cattle farms are found located between Mende and neighbouring communes.

This attraction to sheep is ancestral to Mende, since the city has long lived wool exploitation, since the 16th century. In 1333 the city already had a brotherhood of the weavers. In 1849, the town was still equipped with five large mills. However, while having a rich textile past, the city now retains no activity.

===Industry===
Like the Lozère department, industry in Mende is mainly oriented towards the timber sector: Its operation, its treatment, its derivatives, etc. Another industry that holds an important place in the city is that of construction and public works.

===Shops and services===
Mende is also the seat of the that handles .

The city is strongly turned towards the tertiary sector. As said above, a majority of the enterprises of the city are shops. Mende is the centre of an area&#x27;s population of approximately 25,000 inhabitants around the Lot Valley, the city therefore centralises much of the services. Its quality of prefecture adds to the presence of public service.

Tourism has also developed since the end of the 20th century. This openness on tourism translated between 1983 and 2008 by the creation of the office of tourism (municipal and intermunicipal), an increase of 400 beds offered to tourists, the opening of a holiday village and of a youth hostel, but also the creation of activity centre (canoe base, Freestyle Park, etc.). The city has eleven hotels, four with three stars and four having two. To this one can add the holiday village of Chapitre that offers 42 gîtes for rent, as well as two campsites near the Lot.

Other businesses are those that can be found in other modern cities (banks, insurance, bakeries, the press houses, clothes, etc.). The city has a supermarket and a hypermarket, as well as several superettes and other discounters. The hypermarket, which is of recent construction, belongs to the Système U group and is located in the new area of activity of Ramilles. The supermarket (Intermarché) is, meanwhile, close to the city centre. Markets, vestiges of the traditional markets of the city are many, taking place on Wednesday (textile, utility, etc.) at &quot;Place Chaptal&quot;, and on Saturday mornings (food market) at &quot;Place Chaptal&quot; and &quot;Place Urbain V&quot;. In addition, night markets are held during the summer.

===Business===
The main companies in terms of turnover, as well as major private employers are:

==Local culture and heritage==

===Places and monuments===

Since 1981 Mende has been classified as a city of art, and, since 2000, the grouping of &quot;Mende and Lot in the Gévaudan&quot; has the label of &quot;city and land of art and history&quot;.

Indeed, the city has a rich architectural heritage, witness of the prosperous time related to the papacy.

*The Cathedral Notre-Dame and Saint-Privat
The Cathedral of Saint-Privat (classed as a historical monument in 1906) whose construction began in 1368 at the initiative of Pope Urban V. Its bell towers date back, however, to the 16th century, following the destruction of one of them during the passage of the Huguenots by Matthieu Merle. The large belfry included housing &quot;Non Pareille&quot;, the largest bell in the world melted between 1517 and 1521 in Villefort and destroyed during the Wars of Religion. There remains only the clapper. The cathedral consists of twelve rectangular chapels, two pentagonal chapels and a sacristy. Originally it was built above the Sainte-Thècle crypt where the body of Saint Privat had been buried. It is located next to the old episcopal palace.

*Public fountains

The city has many public fountains. Water from the causses thus enters a piping system located beneath the city before joining the Lot. Two of them (Aigues-Passe and Soubeyrand) are classified as historic monuments. Piped water also enters the old wash house of the Calquières, still visible on &quot;Rue d&#x27;Angiran&quot;.

*The Tower of the Penitents

This tower is one of the few remains of the ancient walls of the 12th century. Protecting the Gate of Angiran which was next to it, this tower served as guard for the short-lived Seneschal of Mende. It includes three floors and an attic. This is the installation of the chapel which is adjacent, and especially its bell tower at the top which saved the tower during the destruction of the walls in 1768.

*The Notre-Dame Bridge

Dating back to the 13th century, this bridge is one of the symbols of the city. It has never been carried away by frequent floods in Mende. It formerly went by the name of Peyrenc Bridge, then took the name of Notre Dame due to the presence on its mouth of a Virgin, which disappeared during the Wars of Religion. Its span has a opening and is high.

*The Hermitage of Saint Privat

Saint Privat withdrew, in the 3rd century, into caves that he had built over Mende, on . Since his Hermitage was built, it also to allow the pilgrims to go there. It can be accessed either by Way of the Cross (from the market) or by road from the causse (RD 25). At the hermitage, we find a hotel for the reception of the pilgrims, a chapel, grotto and a breakthrough designed to the original cave.

*The former consular home

The House where the consul sat, since 1578, also served as city hall after the Revolution. On its pediment is found the arms of the city: &quot;Azure in the Gothic M of or, a shining Sun similarly topped.&quot; Facing it is a trompe-l&#x27;œil wall symbolizing the twinning of Mende and Volterra.

*Bahours Castle

Located in the northwest of the city, the Bahours locality had two castles, one of which was destroyed in 1960. The remaining one is a strong house (manse) built in the 17th century, possibly on the foundations of a more ancient building. The main interest of this strong house is its kitchen listed as a historical monument, like the whole building.

===Cultural facilities===

Mende features a municipal theatre and several rooms that can be used to this kind of show. The ancient theatre of the city turned into cinema. A development project involves the construction of a new multicultural hall. In addition, Mende has a departmental library, the Lamartine Library.

====Theatres and auditoriums====
The ancient theatre of the city, established between 1890 and 1895, was replaced by a cinema. The main room used for the theatre is now the festival hall located at the market. This room, and its natural scenery of arches, is multi-cultural and is the largest in the city in terms of capacity. On the market lies the &quot;antirouille&quot;, a municipal building for young people and allowing everyone to have access to the internet, this building has a room to organize concerts.

Near the market, along the &quot;Chemin Saint-Ilpide&quot;, the Urban V municipal room hosts plays, live shows, and also meetings and projections (world knowledge, for example).

Finally as part of the redevelopment of the market (started by the installation of the intercommunal tourism office and the renovation of the Lamartine Library), an auditorium should be created behind the festival hall (the Emile-Joly Square being moved).

====Museums and exhibitions====

The Ignon-Fabre Museum (or the Museum of Mende) was located on &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Épine&quot; [street of the Holy thorn], at the , where there was installed the first electrification plant of the city. It was however closed due to lack of budget. Before it, a museum was located in a house next to the prison.

The Chapel of Saint-Dominique and the current Department Hall can serve as an exhibition space, as can the Chapel of the Penitents and the former consular house.

In addition a project of the Museum of , currently under study, should be installed in the Chapel of the Penitents.

This quote comes perhaps from the conditions in which the geographer of the king came in the city. Like those who would declare to Serge Livrozet that Mende was &quot;capital of Lozère and torture&quot;.

<text>The RT-2PM Topol (; NATO reporting name SS-25 [[Sickle]]; GRAU designation: 15Ж58 (&quot;15Zh58&quot;); START I designation: RS-12M Topol) was a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile designed in the Soviet Union and in service with Russia&#x27;s Strategic Missile Troops. , Russia planned to replace all RT-2PM ICBMs with versions of Topol-M. In December 2023, the last Topol regiment was taken off combat duty.

== Development ==
The three stage solid propellant RT-2PM Topol is an improved mobile ICBM which replaced earlier outdated missile complexes. It emerged from the same line of development as mobile missiles such as the RT-21 Temp 2S and the RSD-10 Pioneer, and was deployed as a replacement for the widely deployed UR-100. The United States considered developing their own road-mobile ICBM called the Midgetman, but the program was canceled with the end of the Cold War.

Development of the RT-2PM was approved on 19 July 1977 and carried out by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology headed by Alexander Nadiradze. Flight tests were conducted on the Plesetsk test site from February through December 1985. The main problem that had to be overcome during this period was the development of battle management system. After the first test series was successfully conducted in April 1985, with the first regiment with Topol missiles put on alert in July 1985. Throughout this time work continued on improving the battle management system. The test missile firings were finally completed in December 1987. The first regiment of &quot;Topol&quot; missiles employing a modernized mobile command center (in the area of Irkutsk) were put on alert on 27 May 1988. After Nadiradze&#x27;s death in 1988 Boris N. Lapygin continued his work on the Topol missile.

== Design ==
The RT-2PM ICBM was designed to be road mobile and is mounted on a heavy truck (MAZ-7310 or MAZ-7917).

The RT-2PM is a road mobile 3-stage, single warhead ICBM. Its 23,500 mm length and 2,170 mm diameter are approximately the same size and shape as the U.S. Minuteman ICBM. It has a throw-weight of 1,400 kg and carries a single warhead with a yield of 800-1,000 kt and accuracy (CEP) of 900m. It can fire from field deployment sites or through sliding roof garage bases. The RT-2PM Topol joined operational Soviet SRF regiments in 1985. A total area of approximately 190,000 square kilometers could be required to deploy a force consisting of 500 road-mobile Topol ICBMs. Mobile units require a much higher number of personnel for maintenance and operation than fixed systems. Consequently, the RT-2PM Topol was significantly more costly to maintain and operate than silo launched systems.

All three stages are made of composite materials. During first stage operation the flight control is implemented through four aerodynamic and four jet vanes. Four similar trellised aerodynamic surfaces serve for stabilization. During the second and third stage of flight gas is injected into the diverging part of the nozzle for flight control.

The missile is deployed in a Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) canister mounted on cross-country 7-axle chassis on a mobile launch vehicle. The chassis incorporates jacks, gas and hydraulic drives and cylinders, with a power of several hundred tons, for jacking and leveling of the launcher, speeding up (combat) and slowing down (maintaining) elevation of the container with the missile in the vertical position. The TEL is accompanied by a Mobile command post, carrying support facilities mounted on cross-country 4-axle chassis with unified vans. The complex is equipped with an onboard inertial navigation system which gives the TEL group the capability to conduct the launch independently from its field deployment sites. This topo-geodesic support and navigation subsystem, created by the &quot;Signal&quot; Research Institute, provides a quick and highly precise tie-in of the launcher in a field position and enables its crew to carry out missile launches from any combat patrol route point. The launch can also be carried out at regimental bases from the aforementioned garrison garage.

==Operational history==

At the time of the signing of the START I Treaty in 1991 the Soviet Union had deployed some 288 Topol missiles. Deployment continued, and at the end of 1996 a total of 360 Topol missiles were deployed.

The Topol missile was deployed at previously developed deployment sites. After the INF Treaty was signed in 1987 several RSD-10 Pioneer deployment sites were adapted to launch the Topol missiles. The United States expressed specific concerns during the INF treaty negotiations. When the RT-2PM missile system was deployed in the field, with its missile inside the canister and mounted on the launcher, the US contended that the canister might conceal an RSD-10 Pioneer missile. This was of concern because unlike the single warhead of the RT-2PM Topol, the RSD-10 carried up to 3 warheads. A resolution was reached after the Soviet Union agreed to allow inspection parties to use radiation detection systems to measure fast neutron intensity flux emanating from the launch canister. A launch canister with a missile inside containing a single warhead, such as the RT-2PM Topol, emitted a different pattern of fast neutrons than did one with a missile having three warheads, such as the RSD-10.

Provisions of the SALT II agreement prohibited the deployment of more than one new missile (which became RT-23UTTh), it was officially declared by the Soviet Union that the RT-2PM Topol was developed to upgrade the silo based RT-2. The US government disputed this view, contending that the missile was clearly more than 5% larger and had twice the throw-weight as the RT-2 and therefore constituted a new missile system. Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov, Soviet Chief of General Staff cancelled the September 1, 1983 test flight of the RT-2PM Topol which was to be launched from Plesetsk (the launch site in northwest Russia used for test firing of solid fuel propellant ICBMs)- 24 minutes later to land in the Klyuchi target area on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The night of the scheduled launch was the night that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down after accidentally intruding Soviet airspace over Kamchatka.

An RT-2PM Topol with two MIRVs may have been tested in 1991, and the missile was tested at least once with four MIRV warheads, but there has apparently been no further development of a multiple warhead version. This became a point of contention during the conclusion of the 1991 START negotiations, at which time the US pressed for a definition of &quot;downloading&quot; (removing warheads from missiles) that would complicate any Soviet attempt suddenly to deploy multiple warheads on the RT-2PM Topol.

Russia plans to reequip approximately 400 silos where obsolete UR-100, RT-2 and MR-UR-100 missiles are located. Under the START II Treaty, which is a non-binding agreement, Russia would be able to place 90 single-warhead solid fuel missiles in reequipped R-36 silos. In order to guard against a break-out scenario involving the rapid reconversion of R-36 silos on-site inspection became a very important aspect of START II verification.

===Post-Soviet period===

The breakup of the Soviet Union had a significant impact on the Topol program. The dispersed manufacturing of ICBM components seriously complicated researching and building new missile systems. For example, the Minsk Wheeled Truck-Tractor Manufacturing Plant in Belarus manufactured the missiles&#x27; transporter launchers, and some 90% of the components of the guidance system were manufactured in Ukraine.

In Belarus, as of December 1995, 63 RT-2PM Topol ICBMs originally deployed there had been returned to Russia. As of December 1995, Belarus had two operational mobile RT-2PM Topol regiments remaining on its territory, with a total of 18 nuclear warheads. In July 1992, Belarus signed an agreement with Russia placing the regiments under exclusive Russian control. In September 1993, Moscow and Minsk signed an agreement requiring the return of these nuclear missiles and all related missile support equipment to Russia by the end of 1996. A total of 81 RT-2PM Topol ICBMs and associated warheads were returned to Russia from Belarus.

By the late 1990s the lack of resources and qualified personnel forced the Strategic Rocket Forces to cut back operations considerably, with no more than one or two regiments of the mobile RT-2PM Topol missiles dispersed in the field. The remaining 40 or so regiments, each with nine single-warhead missiles, remain in garrison.

===Recent history===
On 18 October 2007, another successful test launch was conducted. One Topol from a mobile launcher at Plesetsk test site reached its target on Kamchatka. As the Strategic Rocket Forces representative reported, it allowed for the extension of Topol&#x27;s service life to 21 years.

Another test of the RT-2PM Topol was carried out on Thursday, August 28, 2008. The launch was said to be specially tasked to test the missile&#x27;s capability to avoid ground-based detection systems.

Another test was conducted on 12 October 2008 when a Topol was launched from the Plesetsk test site in northern Russia. The missile, with a dummy warhead, hit a target at the Kura Test Range on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Tests conducted on 28 October 2011 and 3 November 2011, confirmed service life extension to 23 years (to 2019). More tests for extension to 25 years were announced, and on October 30, 2012, an RS-12M Topol Intercontinental Ballistic Missile was launched from the Plesetsk site in northern Russia 

On 4 March 2014, Russia test fired an RS-12M Topol Intercontinental Ballistic Missile from Kapustin Yar testing ground near the Caspian Sea, successfully hitting its target at a test ground in Kazakhstan. Although the United States had received advanced notice about the test it had coincided with the annexation of Crimea.

On 20 March 2014, Russia test fired an RS-12M Topol Intercontinental Ballistic Missile from Kapustin Yar testing ground.

11 September 2016 - The Russian Strategic Missile Forces have conducted a successful test launch of a RS-12M Topol intercontinental ballistic missile, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
According to the ministry, the missile, launched from the Plesetsk space center in northwestern Russia has hit a designated target on the Kamchatka peninsula &quot;with high precision.&quot; The RS-12M Topol is a single-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile, which entered service in 1985. It has a maximum range of 10,000 km (6,125 miles) and can carry a nuclear warhead with a yield of up to 550 kilotons.

On 28 November 2019 Russian Strategic Missile Troops performed a missile test with a suborbital launch of a RS-12M Topol missile from Kapustin Yar. The test was successful.

The Topol will eventually be replaced by the road-mobile version of the Topol-M missile.

On 16 December 2023, the commander of the Strategic Missile Troops, Colonel General Sergei Karakaev, announced that with the rearmament of the last missile regiment of the Bologovsky missile formation in the Tver region from the Topol to the RS-24 Yars, the re-equipment of the mobile group of the Strategic Missile Forces was completed.

US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimating that as of June 2017 about 100 launchers were operationally deployed.

<text>The Aerocar II Aero-Plane was an unusual light aircraft flown in the United States in 1964. It was developed from designer Moulton Taylor&#x27;s Aerocar roadable aircraft, but could not be driven as a road vehicle. It used the wings and tail designed for the Aerocar, with a new fibreglass cabin. Excluding the parts needed for road operation allowed two more passengers to be carried. Only a single example was built.

<doc id="1069883" wikidata="Q1361501" url="?curid=1069883" title="Battle of Coleto">
<text>The Battle of Coleto, also known as the Battle of Coleto Creek, the Battle of the Prairie, and the Batalla del Encinal del Perdido, was fought on March 19–20, 1836, during the Goliad campaign of the Texas Revolution. In February, General José de Urrea led a branch of the Mexican army up the Gulf Coast of Mexican Texas toward Goliad, where a large contingent of soldiers from the Texian Army was garrisoned under Colonel James W. Fannin. Simultaneously, Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led a larger force into the Texian interior, where on March 6 his troops won the Battle of the Alamo. After learning of the Alamo&#x27;s defeat, Texian general Sam Houston ordered Fannin to retreat from Goliad and join the rest of the army in Victoria.

On March 19, Fannin led his men on a leisurely retreat from Goliad. Mexican troops surrounded the Texians later in the day before Fannin could reach the shelter of a grove of timber at Coleto Creek, some away. Texians formed a square in the middle of the prairie and attempted to defend their position. Although Mexican troops launched three separate attacks against the square, they could not penetrate the Texian position. As night fell, Mexican sharpshooters were able to wound and kill more Texians. With little water to give to the wounded or to cool their artillery, the Texians felt they were unable to withstand further fighting. On the morning of March 20, the Texians surrendered.

Urrea attempted to secure honorable terms for his Texian prisoners. However, Santa Anna had received authorization from the Mexican Congress to treat all captured Texian troops as pirates rather than prisoners-of-war. Under orders from Santa Anna, and despite the appeals for clemency by General José de Urrea, the massacre was reluctantly carried out by Lt. Colonel José Nicolás de la Portilla.

==Background==
Colonel James Fannin was the commander of the Texan troops at Fort Defiance in late 1835 and early 1836. During the siege of the Alamo in February 1836 he attempted a march of 100 miles to relieve the Texan forces at the Alamo but due to poor preparation for the journey and word that general Urrea&#x27;s Mexican forces were approaching Goliad, he turned back. After the Alamo fell to Santa Anna&#x27;s forces the Texians received orders from General Sam Houston to fall back to Victoria. Fannin therefore abandoned the fort but proceeded without adequate supplies and without haste on his retreat.

==Prelude==
By 09:00 on March 19 they began their retreat from Goliad, during a period of heavy fog. The Texian force included the San Antonio Greys, the Red Rovers, the Mustangs commanded by Burr H. Duval, a militia from Refugio commanded by Hugh McDonald Frazer, Texian regular soldiers commanded by Ira Westover, and the Mobile Greys. Nine heavy artillery pieces with different calibers were ordered by Fannin to be taken by the Texians, along with 1000 muskets, but he neglected to ensure that a good amount of food and water was transported. Carts loaded with heavy equipment were being pulled by hungry and tired oxen. Urrea did not realize the Texians had left until 11:00. The two-hour lead was removed, when a Texian cart crossing the San Antonio River broke, a cannon had to be brought out of the river, and Fannin ordered that the oxen be allowed to graze for a period of time after the Texians had proceeded about a mile past Manahuilla Creek, resulting in the retreat being stopped. John Shackelford, Burr H. Duval, and Ira Westover opposed Fannin&#x27;s decision to allow the oxen to graze, arguing that they should continue their retreat until they reached the protection of the Coleto Creek timber. Shackelford would state that Fannin argued that the Mexican army against them was poor, and that Urrea would not follow them.
In an effort to catch Fannin&#x27;s troops Urrea left his artillery, and some of his men, in Goliad. He began his pursuit with, according to Mexican sources, 80 cavalrymen and 360 infantrymen. Mexican mounted scouts determined the location of the Texians, and reported the size of the force, which Urrea concluded was smaller than he originally thought. As a result, he ordered 100 of his soldiers to go back to Goliad to help secure Presidio La Bahía. He also ordered the artillery he left in Goliad to be brought to him, and that the artillery would be escorted by some of the soldiers he was sending back. Meanwhile, Albert C. Horton&#x27;s 30 cavalrymen were serving as advance guards, and were positioned to cover all sides of the Texian force. The rear guard was not alert, and did not detect the Mexican cavalry that was approaching the Texians. Shortly after they resumed their march another Texian cart broke down, and its cargo had to be transferred to another one, delaying the retreat again. Shortly after, Fannin had sent Horton to scout the Coleto Creek timber that was in sight, then the Mexican cavalry overtook Fannin&#x27;s Texians. As the Texians tried to get to high ground 400 to 500 yards away from the position they were in when the cavalry overtook them, the ammunition cart broke.

==Battle==
The Texian soldiers formed a square against the Mexicans. The high grass of the prairie meant the Texian view of the Mexicans was impaired. The Texians had little water. Each Texian soldier received three to four muskets. The square was three ranks deep. The front line contained the San Antonio Greys and Red Rovers, whilst Duval&#x27;s Mustangs and Frazer&#x27;s Refugio militia formed part of the rear line. The left flank was covered by Westover&#x27;s regulars, whilst the right was protected by the Mobile Greys. In the corners of the square, the artillery had been positioned. Fannin stood in the rear of the right flank. In addition, a number of sharpshooters were deployed around Abel Morgan&#x27;s hospital wagon, which could no longer be moved after the ox that was moving it was killed by Mexican fire.

The Mexican soldiers then attacked the square. The left of the Texian square was confronted by the rifle companies under Morales, and the right was assaulted by the grenadiers and part of the San Luis Battalion. The Mexican formations involved in this attack on the right of the square was under the personal supervision of Urrea. The Jiménez Battalion under Col. Mariano Salas fought the front, and Col. Gabriel Núñez&#x27;s cavalry was ordered against the rear of the square. By sunset, when Urrea ordered the Mexicans to cease any more major attacks against the square due to a lack of Mexican ammunition, the majority of the action of 19 March was over. The Mexicans had assaulted the square three times. Making effective use of their bayonets, multiple muskets, and nine cannons, the Texians had prevented the Mexicans each time from breaking the square. Urrea said that he was impressed with the fact that the Texians had managed to maintain the square against the three charges, and he was also impressed with the Texian weapon fire. Dr. Joseph H. Barnard, a Texian, recorded that by sunset seven Texians had been killed. He also recorded that sixty Texians, including Fannin, had been wounded. Forty of the sixty had been wounded several times.

After sunset, Urrea ordered Mexican sharpshooters to be positioned in the tall grass around the square, and that they fire at the Texians. Before Texian sharpshooters were able to remove the threat posed by the Mexican sharpshooters, by firing at the flash caused by the Mexican guns, the Mexican sharpshooters were able to inflict more Texian casualties. As a result of all the fighting that occurred on 19 March, the Texians had suffered at least ten dead and sixty wounded, whilst the Mexicans suffered an unspecified high number of casualties. The fighting of 19 March had not demoralized the Texian soldiers. They were encouraged by the thought that Horton would succeed in getting Texian reinforcements from Guadalupe Victoria to Fannin. However, Horton had not been able to break through the Mexican defenses. During the day&#x27;s fighting the Texian soldiers that were retreating to Guadalupe Victoria after the earlier battle of Refugio were close enough to Fannin to hear gunfire. However, they were exhausted and hungry and did not move to the square. Urrea stationed three detachments of Mexican troops around the square, to prevent the Texians in the square from escaping, and during the night Mexican false bugle calls were sounded to keep the Texians alert.

The Texans&#x27; lack of water, and the inability to light fires in the square, meant the wounded Texians could not be treated. The pain being experienced by the wounded resulted in the general decrease in morale amongst the Texian soldiers during the night. The poor weather during the night further lessened the morale of the soldiers. The lack of water also meant that the artillery could not be used effectively the next day, because the water was needed to cool and clean the cannons. The fighting of 19 March had also left many Texian artillerists casualties, and ammunition for the cannons was low. All these factors contributed to the conclusion by Fannin and other officers during the night that they could not sustain another day of fighting. An idea for the Texians to escape to a more defend-able position under cover of darkness, before Urrea received reinforcements, was rejected because it was decided that those who were too injured to escape, which included friends and relatives of unwounded Texians, should not be left behind. It was therefore decided that the Texians should attempt to make another stand from their current position the next day. As a result, during the night, the Texians dug trenches and erected barricades of carts and dead animals. Urrea, meanwhile, had been reinforced with munitions, fresh troops, and two or three artillery pieces from Goliad. He positioned the Mexican artillery on the slopes overlooking the Texian square.

At 06:15 on March 20, the Mexicans were grouped for battle. After one or two rounds were fired by Mexican artillery Fannin and his officers re-iterated their conclusion that the Texians could not take another day&#x27;s fighting, and decided to seek honorable terms for surrender. They drafted terms of surrender, which included statements that the Texian wounded would be treated, that they would be gain all the protection expected as prisoners of war, and that they would be paroled to the United States of America. However, Santa Anna had stated earlier that any Texian can only be allowed to surrender unconditionally. As a result, Urrea could not guarantee that all the terms would be followed by Santa Anna. He stated that he would talk to Santa Anna on behalf of the terms of surrender presented by the Texians. The document of surrender was signed by Benjamin C. Wallace, Joseph M. Chadwick, and Fannin. As a result of the signing, the battle of Coleto ended.

==Aftermath==

Those Texians that could walk were sent to Goliad, under Mexican escort. It would take until about March 23 until those Texians that could not walk were transported to Goliad. During that time, Mexican physicians were told that wounded Mexicans were a priority to treat, as opposed to the wounded Texians. Fannin arrived in Goliad on March 22. Urrea, meanwhile, had moved onto Guadalupe Victoria, from where he wrote to Santa Anna a letter recommending that the Texian prisoners should be treated with clemency. However, Santa Anna did not follow Urrea&#x27;s recommendation, instead ordering the Mexican commander at Goliad, Jose Nicolas de la Portilla, to execute the Texian prisoners. On Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, Fannin and about 425 to 445 other Texian prisoners were shot by Mexican soldiers. The execution became known as the Goliad Massacre.

The Battle of Coleto was significant because it showed that Texian troops involved in the battle, despite being relatively untrained, were able to stand up to the Mexican troops against them and obey their commanders. The battle was primarily lost because Fannin did not act decisively enough to ensure success and also underestimated the quality of the Mexican force against him. It also illustrated that Fannin was reluctant to coordinate his actions with other Texian forces, a trait that was common for many Texian commanders.

<text>The Viper Room is a nightclub and live music venue located on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California, United States. It was established under its current name on August 14, 1993, being co-owned by actors and &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; co-stars Johnny Depp and Sal Jenco. The Viper Room has undergone several changes in ownership, with the present owner being Viper Holdings, Ltd CEO James Cooper. It continues to host music of multiple genres, including metal, punk, and alternative rock. While predominantly known as a music venue, the Viper Room also has a lower level which is home to a large whiskey bar.

The club became known as a hangout spot for the young Hollywood elite, and gained infamy for its drug-related incidents; actor River Phoenix had a fatal drug overdose in 1993, actor Jason Donovan suffered a drug-induced seizure in 1995 but survived, and singer Courtney Love survived an overdose in 1995 after Depp gave her CPR. In 1997, singer Michael Hutchence played his last public performance in the Viper Room before taking his own life a week later.

==History==
The location was originally a grocery store from 1921 into the 1940s. In the 1940s, it was converted into a nightclub called the &quot;Cotton Club&quot;, entirely unrelated to the Harlem original. This was soon replaced by &quot;The Greenwich Village Inn&quot;, the &quot;Rue Angel&quot; and finally &quot;The Last Call&quot; during the 1940s. From 1951 to 1969, the location was a bar called &quot;The Melody Lounge&quot;. In 1969, it became &quot;Filthy McNasty&#x27;s&quot;. and in the 1980s, a jazz club called &quot;The Central&quot;. 

&quot;The Central&quot; was best known for its Tuesday jam nights where various well-known musicians such as Joe Cocker, Brian Setzer and Jeff Baxter performed and hung out along with others in the music industry. It also hosted many local music acts such as Chuck E. Weiss who was frequently accompanied by the Goddamn Liars. In 1993, the club was close to shutting down when Weiss suggested to Depp that he should revitalize the spot and rename it &quot;The Viper Room&quot;. Tom Waits also had a hand in redeveloping the spot.

===The venue===
Despite the death of River Phoenix the year the venue opened, the club became and remained a hangout for Hollywood&#x27;s most popular young actors and musicians. Adam Duritz, the lead singer of Counting Crows, worked as a Viper Room bartender in late 1994 and early 1995 to escape his newfound fame.

=== Ownership ===
As part of the settlement of a lawsuit against Johnny Depp and four others, involving allegations of mismanagement of profits, Depp relinquished his ownership of the Viper Room in 2004. The club changed hands multiple times between 2004 and 2016; the club is currently owned by Viper Room Holdings, Ltd. CEO James Cooper.

===Intellectual property and lawsuits===
A nightclub formerly called &quot;The Viper Room&quot; exists in Cincinnati. The club changed its name to &quot;The Poison Room&quot; on January 1, 2006, after they were told by the West Hollywood Viper Room to stop using the name. Another &quot;Viper Room&quot; in Portland was also told to stop using the name under threat of a trademark lawsuit, with the Viper Room&#x27;s former owner claiming that &quot;every dollar they make is the result of using our name&quot;. Abroad, there is also a legal brothel in Brisbane called &quot;The Viper Room&quot; and nightclubs boasting the name (or a similar one) in Harrogate, Sheffield, Stockholm, and Vienna.

Until February 2009, there was a nightclub with the same name in Melbourne; it was closed down due to a spate of violent incidents that included two shootings as well as license breaches and the arrest of a co-owner on drug charges. On April 16, 2011, a nightclub named &quot;The Viper Room&quot; opened its doors in the city of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. The club is named after the club in Hollywood and is decorated in the same style as the American club. In 2016, The Viper Room began issuing cease and desist notices to bootleg merchandise sellers on eBay and other online storefronts.

The original building where the club is currently located is slated to be demolished by 2024, to make way for a replacement club, retail and a five star hotel tower.

==Performers==
At Depp&#x27;s request, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed on the club&#x27;s opening night.

Johnny Cash performed at the venue, debuting material that would later appear on &quot;American Recordings&quot; (1994). In 1997, the Viper Room was also a place of a few early solo live performances by John Frusciante at the time of his bad physical condition caused by drug abuse.

Other performers include Hot Mom, Avril Lavigne, Neurotic Outsiders (featuring Duff McKagan, Steve Jones and John Taylor), The Penfifteen Club, Keanu Reeves (who performed there with his band Dogstar in 1997), The Cult, Slash, X, Julliette and the Licks, Concrete Blonde, Green Day, Courtney Love, Hole, Joey Ramone, Tenacious D, The Strokes, and Cher.

== In popular culture ==
* In the 1983 film &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, the building (then housing a nightclub called The Central) was used for scenes featuring the new-wave band the Plimsouls. 
* In Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), the building was used as a filming location for scenes depicting the London Fog, also of West Hollywood. London Fog was a lesser-known nightclub halfway up the same block from the Whisky a Go Go where the Doors had their first regular gigs for four months in early 1966.
* The 2003 &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; &quot;Pink Panther Dance&quot; scene was filmed at the club, though the club&#x27;s name was changed in the film to &quot;The Treasure Chest&quot;.
* Several scenes in the 2005 John Travolta film &quot;Be Cool&quot; were set at or in the club, although only the exterior of the site was used in the shoot.
* The Viper Room is also featured in the 2004 documentary &quot;Dig!&quot; when members of the band The Brian Jonestown Massacre began brawling with each other on stage while performing.
* The Viper Room was once the base of an underground poker ring, reportedly founded by actor Tobey Maguire. The ring often included other actors such as Ben Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. The poker ring inspired the 2017 movie &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot;, starring Jessica Chastain, in which the club was renamed &quot;The Cobra Lounge&quot;.
* The Viper Room&#x27;s latest feature has been in the series &#x27;Pam &amp; Tommy&#x27; (featuring Lily James and Sebastian Stan), which details an altercation between Tommy Lee and two other bathroom goers, confirming the bar&#x27;s popularity among the rock scene in the early nineties which still continues through to this day.
* The Viper Room is featured in an episode of paranormal series &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; as one of their lockdown locations, where they investigated the building for two days. In 2019, &quot;BuzzFeed Unsolved Supernatural&quot; filmed an episode in the club.
* The Viper Room basement is the setting for the initial set of poker games Molly Bloom hosted.
* In 2019, the music video for the song &quot;Blow&quot; by Ed Sheeran, Chris Stapleton, and Bruno Mars was filmed at the Viper Room.
* In 2021, the Viper Room was the feature of season 1, episode 2 of Vice Media&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the 90&#x27;s&quot; entitled &quot;The Viper Room: Hollywood&#x27;s Sanctuary.&quot;
* Outsider musician Wesley Willis&#x27; song &quot;The Viper Room&quot; (found on the &quot;Greatest Hits, Vol. 3&quot; compilation album) is about the club. Willis&#x27; performances at the club and the death of River Phoenix outside the venue are referenced in the lyrics.
* In Spook Country, a 2006 novel by William Gibson, a character uses the sidewalk outside of the Viper Room as part of a GPS/ virtual reality art installation.

<doc id="1069886" wikidata="Q364220" url="?curid=1069886" title="Henry Wells">
<text>Henry Wells (December 12, 1805 – December 10, 1878) was an American businessman important in the history of both the American Express Company and Wells Fargo &amp; Company. Wells worked as a freight agent before joining the express business. His companies, which were the predecessors of American Express and Wells Fargo, competed with the United States Post Office by carrying mail at less than the government rate. In higher education, Wells was the founder of Wells College in Aurora, New York.

== Life==
Henry Wells was born in 1805 in Thetford, Vermont, the son of Dorothea &quot;Dorothy&quot; (Randall) and Shipley Wells, a Presbyterian minister at what is now the First Presbyterian Church of Seneca Falls, New York who moved his family to central New York State in the westward migration of Yankees out of New England. He was a member of the seventh generation of his family in America. His ancestor was an English immigrant Thomas Welles (1590–1659), who arrived in Massachusetts in 1635 and was the only man in Connecticut&#x27;s history to hold all four top offices: governor, deputy governor, treasurer, and secretary. In this capacity, he transcribed the Fundamental Orders into the official colony records on 14 January 1638, OS, (24 January 1639, NS).

As a child, Henry worked on a farm and attended school in Fayette. In 1822, he was apprenticed to Jessup &amp; Palmer, tanners and shoemakers at Palmyra, New York. In his adult life, he was also called as Henry &quot;Stuttering&quot; Wells and was known as a flamboyant character.

==Career==
In 1836, Wells became a freight agent on the Erie Canal and soon started his own business. Later he worked for Harnden&#x27;s Express in Albany. His entry into the express business launched a series of events that eventually led to the establishment of the American Express Company. When Wells suggested that service could be expanded west of Buffalo, New York, William F. Harnden urged Wells to go into business on his own account. In 1841, the firm of Pomeroy &amp; Company was formed by George E. Pomeroy, Henry Wells and Crawford Livingston. In the express business they competed with the United States Post Office by carrying mail at less than the government rate. Popular support, roused by the example of the penny post in England, was on the side of the expressmen, and the government was compelled to reduce its rates in 1845 and again in 1851.

Pomeroy &amp; Company was succeeded in 1844 by Livingston, Wells &amp; Company, composed of Crawford Livingston, Henry Wells, William Fargo and Thaddeus Pomeroy. On April 1, 1845, Wells &amp; Company&#x27;s Western Express – generally known simply as Western Express because it was the first such company west of Buffalo – was established by Wells, Fargo and Daniel Dunning. Service was offered at first as far as Detroit, rapidly expanding to Chicago, St. Louis, and Cincinnati.

In 1846, Wells sold his interest in Western Express to William Livingston, whereupon the firm became Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company. Wells then went to New York City to work for Livingston, Wells &amp; Company, concentrating on the promising transatlantic express business. When Crawford Livingston died in 1847, another of his brothers entered the firm, which became Wells &amp; Company. (However, Livingston, Wells &amp; Company continued to operate under that firm name in England, France and Germany.)

===American Express and Wells Fargo===

Early in 1850, Wells formed Wells, Butterfield &amp; Company with John Butterfield as the successor of Butterfield &amp; Wasson. The same year the American Express Company was formed as a consolidation of Wells &amp; Company; Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company; and Wells, Butterfield &amp; Company. Wells was president of American Express from 1850 to 1868. About the time the company was formed, he relocated in Aurora, New York, which remained his home for the rest of his life. There he built a grand residence, called Glen Park. It was designed by noted architect A.J. Davis, with grounds by Andrew Jackson Downing, another notable architect. The property later became part of Wells College, which Wells founded.

When John Butterfield and other directors of American Express objected to extending the company&#x27;s service to California, Wells organized Wells, Fargo &amp; Company on March 18, 1852, to undertake the venture. Edwin B. Morgan of Aurora was the company&#x27;s first president, and Wells, William Fargo, Johnston Livingston and James McKay were on the boards of both Wells Fargo and American Express.

In September 1853, Wells Fargo &amp; Company acquired Livingston, Wells &amp; Company, which had been its express and banking correspondent in England, France and Germany. By the spring of 1854, some of the directors of Wells Fargo had become convinced that the purchase had been brought about through unspecified misrepresentations by Wells, Johnston Livingston, William N. Babbitt and S. De Witt Bloodgood. Wells and his associates made good any losses to Wells Fargo, and Livingston, Wells &amp; Company wound up its affairs when its Paris office was closed in October 1856.

Wells was president in 1855 of the New Granada Canal &amp; Steam Navigation Company. In Aurora he was president of the First National Bank of Aurora and in 1867 also the first president of the Cayuga Lake Railroad.

===Later endeavors===
Wells retired from the board of Wells Fargo in 1867. He also retired as president of American Express in 1868 when it was merged with the Merchants Union Express Company under the presidency of William Fargo. Also in 1868, Wells founded Wells College in Aurora with an endowment to make it one of the first women&#x27;s colleges in the United States.

One of Wells&#x27; last ventures was the Arizona &amp; New Mexico Express Company, of which he was president in 1876.

==Personal life==
On September 5, 1827, Wells married Sarah Caroline Daggett (1803–1859), the daughter of Levi Daggett (1768–1835) and a descendant of the Doggett colonial settlers. They had four children:
* Charles Henry Wells (1828–1891), who married Louisa Burnham (1832–1905)
* Mary Elizabeth Wells (1830–1884), who married James H. Welles (1819–1873)
* Oscar A. Wells (1833–1909)
* Edward Wells

After his first wife&#x27;s death on October 13, 1859, in Albany, New York, he married Mary Prentice of Boston in 1861.

Wells died in Glasgow, Scotland, on December 10, 1878, two days short of his 73rd birthday. He was brought home for burial in Aurora and was buried at Oak Glen Cemetery in Aurora. His body was transported back to the United States aboard the steam-ship Ethiopia. His funeral was held at his home in Aurora.

<doc id="1069895" wikidata="Q1425448" url="?curid=1069895" title="Groomsman">
<text>A groomsman or usher is one of the male attendants to the groom in a wedding ceremony. Usually, the groom selects close friends and relatives to serve as groomsmen, and it is considered an honor to be selected. From his groomsmen, the groom usually chooses one to serve as best man.

For a wedding with many guests, the groom may also ask other male friends and relatives to act as ushers without otherwise participating in the wedding ceremony; their sole task is ushering guests to their seats before the ceremony. Ushers may also be hired for very large weddings.

In a military officer&#x27;s wedding, the roles of groomsmen are replaced by swordsmen of the sword honor guard. They are usually picked as close personal friends of the groom who have served with him. Their role includes forming the traditional saber arch for the married couple and guests to walk through.

The first recorded use of the word ‘groomsmen’, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was as recently as 1698, although the words ‘bride’ and ‘groom’ both date back to Old English.

==Duties==

The most visible duty of the groomsmen is helping guests find their places before the ceremony and to stand near the groom during the wedding ceremony.

Additionally, the groom may request other kinds of assistance, such as planning celebratory events such as a bachelor party, also called a stag do or buck&#x27;s night; helping make the wedding pleasant for guests by talking with people who are alone or dancing with unaccompanied guests or bridesmaids, if there is dancing at a wedding reception; or providing practical assistance with gifts, luggage, or unexpected complications. Groomsmen may also participate in local or regional traditions, such as decorating the newlywed couple&#x27;s car.

Bridegroom-men formerly had important duties. The men were called bride-knights, and represented a survival of the primitive days of marriage by capture, when a man called his friends in to assist to &quot;lift&quot; or kidnap the bride, or from the need to defend the bride from would-be kidnappers.

==Best man==
The best man is the chief assistant to the groom at a wedding. While the role is older, the earliest surviving written use of the term &quot;best man&quot; comes from 1782, observing that &quot;best man and best maid&quot; in the Scottish dialect are equivalent to &quot;bride-man and bride-maid&quot; in England.

In most modern Anglophone countries, the groom extends this honor to someone who is close to him, generally a close friend or a relative (such as a sibling or cousin). During a wedding ceremony the best man stands next to the groom, slightly behind him. This means that the four people present at the altar are the officiant (such as a civil celebrant, priest, rabbi, minister, or other religious figure), the bride, groom, and best man. This is common in some western countries, although in others the best man and bridesmaid participate on an equal footing.

While the best man&#x27;s required duties are only those of a friend, in the context of a western white wedding, the best man will typically:
*Assist the groom on the wedding day,
*Organise a bachelor party,
*Keep the wedding rings safe until needed during the ceremony,
*Stand next to the groom during the ceremony,
*Act as a legal witness to the marriage and therefore sign the marriage certificate, and
*Prepare a &quot;best man&#x27;s speech&quot; to be read at the reception

===In various countries and cultures===

The best man is not a universal custom. Even in places where a best man is customary, the role may be quite different when compared to other areas of the world.
* In the Anglosphere, it is traditional for the best man to give a short speech.
* In Zambia, a best man is expected to lead processions both at the wedding, and at preliminary events. This includes pre-wedding dance rehearsals, at which the best man is always expected to be in attendance, and usually is expected to give an outstanding and outlandish dance-performance on the actual wedding-day.
* In Uganda, a best man is expected to guide the newlyweds in the ways of marriage. This means that ideally a best man must be married, preferably to one wife, and should be in position to give sound, tried and tested advice. A best man must be a confidant and be discreet about the details he shares with the new couple. 
* In Bhutan, the best man presents himself at the wedding as a ceremonial guardian to both bride and groom. Thereafter he entertains the guests, sometimes for several hours. 
* In Eastern Orthodox weddings in Greece, the best man is often also the &quot;koumbaros&quot;, or religious sponsor. The koumbaros (or koumbara, if a woman) is an honored participant who crowns the couple and participates in circling the altar three times. Sometimes, this person also pays for most of the wedding expenses.
* In Ukraine, the best man is responsible for guarding the bride during the wedding festivities. In a traditional wedding, when he or the groom stepped away, the bride got &quot;kidnapped&quot; or had a shoe stolen. Then the groom or the best man had to pay a ransom in exchange for returning the bride, usually by paying money (which was given to the bride) or by doing something embarrassing. The custom is less common nowadays due to frequent conflicts arising from the differences in the expected sum of money.

==Bachelor party==

In the past, the bachelor party was typically scheduled for a convenient evening during the week before the wedding. A type of farewell dinner, it was always hosted, and therefore organized and paid for, entirely by the groom. The dinner was seen as the groom&#x27;s last chance to entertain his friends as a single man; after the wedding, dinner parties at his home would always be presided over by his wife in her role as hostess. In recent times this practice has evolved. In many cultures, it is a customary practice for the groom to bear all the expenses of his bachelor party. This tradition highlights the groom&#x27;s role in hosting a final celebration with his friends before his marriage.

Common slang names for this event are &quot;bachelor party, stag do&quot;, or &quot;bucks&#x27; night&quot; in different parts of the world. In many areas, this dinner is now most commonly organized by the best man; the costs can be shared by either all of the participants or all of the participants except for the groom, who becomes the guest of honor.

<doc id="1069901" wikidata="Q791164" url="?curid=1069901" title="Avispa Fukuoka">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Hakata, Fukuoka. They currently compete in the J1 League, which is the top tier of football in the country.

==History==

===Earlier years in Fujieda===
The club were originally based in Fujieda, Shizuoka and was founded as Chūō Bōhan SC in 1982 by the workers of security company Chuo Bohan in Fujieda, Shizuoka. They were promoted to the Japan Soccer League Division 2 in 1991. The club then participated in the newly founded former Japan Football League Division 2 in 1992 and were promoted to Division 1 in 1993. They changed their name to Fujieda Blux with intention to be a J.League member. However, with difficulties to have a stadium that met J.League requirements, and with local competition from Júbilo Iwata and Shimizu S-Pulse, the football fan base in Shizuoka prefecture was already considered saturated.

=== Move to Fukuoka (1994) ===
As a result, in 1994, the club decided to move to Fukuoka where the community was eager to have a J.League club. They adopted new name Fukuoka Blux and became a J.League associate member, while the amateur club of Chūō Bōhan was active in Fujieda until 2006.

===1995 (JFL)===
The first season in Fukuoka saw them win the JFL championship with help from Argentine Hugo Maradona and they were promoted to J.League. After becoming the champions of 1995 Japan Football League as Fukuoka Blux the team was admitted to the J.League in 1996 season.

===1996–1998 (J.League)===
Fukuoka Blux eventually decided to change their name to Avispa Fukuoka, in order to avoid a potential trademark dispute with men&#x27;s clothier Brooks Brothers. &quot;Avispa&quot; itself means &quot;wasp&quot; in Spanish. The club acquired experienced players such as former Japanese international Satoshi Tsunami and defender Hideaki Mori but they finished lowly 15th in the 1996 season.

They finished bottom of the league two consecutive seasons (1997 to 1998), but were able to narrowly avoid relegation. This was because J.League were building foundation of J.League 2 for 1999. Therefore, no clubs were relegated and there were relegation/promotion play-offs for the first time at the end of 1998 season, in which Avispa were involved. Around this time, forward Yoshiteru Yamashita and midfielder Chikara Fujimoto were chosen for the Japanese national team.

===1999–2001 (J1)===
In 1999, they again reinforced the squad by acquiring experienced players such as former internationals Nobuyuki Kojima and Yasutoshi Miura as well as Yugoslavian Nenad Maslovar. They won a fierce relegation battle and eventually stayed up. In 2000, Argentine David Bisconti and Romanian Pavel Badea were transferred to Fukuoka and they finished club record 6th in the second stage. In 2001, the club acquired former Korean international Noh Jung-Yoon and Yoshika Matsubara but they finished 15th and were relegated to J2.

===2002–2005 (J2)===
In 2002, they kept experienced players and released younger players such as Daisuke Nakaharai and Yoshiteru Yamashita but they finished 8th out of 10. In 2002, with new manager Hiroshi Matsuda, they decided to recruit and nurture young players who graduated from local high schools instead of acquiring experienced footballers from other clubs. They initially struggled but came back well and finished 4th. In 2004, they finished 3rd and qualified for the play-offs but Kashiwa Reysol dashed their promotion hope by beating them home and away (the scoreline was both 2–0). In 2005, they finished 2nd and gained an automatic promotion to J1. Avispa players Hokuto Nakamura and Tomokazu Nagira represented Japan for the 2005 World Youth Championship in the Netherlands.

===2006 (J1)===
They had been involved in a relegation battle from the beginning of the season. They finished 16th and were relegated to J2 after the promotion/relegation play-offs against Vissel Kobe, which they tied twice, 0–0 in Kobe, then 1–1 at their home game. Like many J2 teams this has led to financial issues. The Daily Yomiuri reported that in 2006 Avispa needed 535 million yen in loans from the local prefectural and municipal governments.

===2007–2008 (J2)===
With relegation came another new manager, the former German international Pierre Littbarski. &quot;Litti&quot; arrived from the Australian A-League, bringing with him several experienced players such as Mark Rudan, Joel Griffiths and Ufuk Talay, but he was unable to steer Avispa to any notable success. Having finished 7th in 2007, an inability to compete near the top of the league led to Littbarski&#x27;s sacking in mid-2008. He was replaced by former Avispa player Yoshiyuki Shinoda.

===2009 (J2)===
The departure of Littbarski coincided with the departure of the club&#x27;s Australian players, who were largely replaced with youngsters from a number of Kyushu-based universities. After a reasonable start, Avispa&#x27;s form has tailed off sharply, with a recent five-game losing streak including 6–0 and 5–0 thrashings away at Ventforet Kofu and Mito HollyHock respectively. The club finished in the lower half of the J2 table with promotion hopes dashed for another year.

===2010 (J2)===
Yoshiyuki Shinoda bolstered his squad for the 2010 season by adding more players from local University teams, and picked up midfielders Kosuke Nakamachi and Genki Nagasato who had previously played together at Shonan Bellmare.
The season started slowly with the team picking up only 1 point out of a possible 15 in March, but then saw a dramatic improvement in performance as they went on to win 17 of the next 25 games including a come from behind victory against promotion rivals JEF United. As JEF United went on to drop more points Avispa secured promotion back to J1 with 2 games of the season left to play.

Popular striker Tetsuya Okubo was released at the end of the season, along with 4 other players as the squad was prepared for J1.

===2011 (J1)===
The promotion to J1 saw some significant changes to the squad as Takuya Matsuura was brought in to replace Genki Nagasato who departed to Ventforet Kofu under a cloud, Shogo Kobara, Kim Min-je and Takumi Wada coming in to bolster defence, while Sho Naruoka and Kentaro Shigematsu arrived to try to score the goals to keep the club in the division.

Tipped by all pundits on the J-League After Game Show to finish the season in 18th position, the players struggled to gel and went for the first 13 games of the season without earning a point.
Despite improving slightly towards the mid-season break manager Shinoda left the club to be replaced by head coach Tetsuya Asano.

While results continued to improve, culminating in a 6–0 away win to Montedio Yamagata, the club could not pull themselves out of the relegation zone and finished the season in 17th position to be relegated to J2.
At the end of the season the manager was changed again with Koji Maeda being brought in to replace the departing Asano.

===2012 (J2)===
The team was looking to bounce straight back to J1 upon their return to the second tier but endured the worst season in the history of the club as they finished a lowly 18th in the table; only winning 9 games all season and conceding 68 goals (only Gainare Tottori would concede more in the season).
The end of the season saw Koji Maeda part ways with the club as they looked to rebuild towards a better 2013.

===2013 (J2)===
The club returned to hiring a non-Japanese manager for the first time since Pierre Littbarski as Slovenian Marijan Pusnik arrived.
His arrival saw a greater emphasis given towards the development of young players at the club as rookies Yuta Mishima and Takeshi Kanamori were given chances in the first team.

Results on the pitch immediately improved and the club were competing around the play-off positions until a slump in form mid-season coincided with the announcement that the club needed ¥50 million to remain solvent. The club finished in 14th position, but found the money to stay afloat, with Pusnik agreeing to remain as manager for another season.

=== 2014 (J2) ===
Avispa finished in 16th place. Pušnik&#x27;s contract was not renewed and he returned to Slovenia.

===2015 (J2)===
The club hired new coach Masami Ihara who twice handled Kashiwa Reysol in a caretaker capacity. They finished third and were promoted back to J1 in winning the promotion playoffs.

===2016 (J1)===
Avispa finished in 18th place and relegated to J2. League.

===2017 (J2)===
Avispa finished in fourth place. In the &quot;J1 promotion play-off&quot;, Avispa won the semi-final game 1–0 against Tokyo Verdy. In the final game however, the team had a scoreless draw, 0-0, with Nagoya Grampus leaving them in third place, meaning Avispa could not be promoted to J1.

===2021–present (J1)===
A second-place finish in the 2020 J2 League saw Avispa returned to J1 League for the first time since 2016.

On 4 November 2023, Avispa won the J.League Cup by defeating two-time winners Urawa Red Diamonds 2–1 in the final match of 2023 edition. It was the first major trophy in the history of the club.

On 31 October 2024,it was announced that head coach Shigetoshi Hasebe who has led Avispa for five years, would be leaving the club at the end of the season.

<text>Jens Fink-Jensen (born 19 December 1956) is a Danish poet, author, photographer, composer and architect.

==Biography==
Fink-Jensen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. From 1968 to 1972 he attended school in Store Heddinge where he was a classmate with the Danish poet Søren Ulrik Thomsen. Fink-Jensen debuted as a writer at the age of 18 when his short story, &quot;Juni 1995 (June 1995)&quot;, was published in the daily newspaper &quot;Information&quot;. The following year, four of his poems were published in the Danish literary magazine &quot;Hvedekorn&quot;. Fink-Jensen graduated in modern languages from Herlufsholm Boarding School in 1976 and subsequently performed his national service with the Royal Life Guard where he trained as an NCO. He later earned a degree in architecture in 1986 from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture in Copenhagen and a further education in multimedia design from the same Academy in 1997.

During the early 1980s, Fink-Jensen was part of a circle of young Danish poets which included Thomsen, Michael Strunge and the editor of &quot;Hvedekorn&quot;, Poul Borum. In October 1980, he helped arrange the &quot;NÅ!!80&quot; festival, a two-day art festival in Copenhagen that combined art, concerts, and poetry readings, and sought to introduce Denmark to what was called the &quot;Nå&quot; generation.

Fink-Jensen published his first collection of poems, titled &quot;Verden i et øje (The World in an Eye)&quot;, in 1981. He followed with two more books of poetry, and then in 1986, he published the collection of short stories &quot;Bæsterne (The Beasts)&quot;. He has also written three children’s book in collaboration with the Danish illustrator Mads Stage: &quot;Jonas og konkylien (Jonas and the Conch Shell)&quot;, &quot;Jonas og himmelteltet (Jonas and the Sky Tent)&quot; and &quot;Jonas og engletræet (Jonas and the Angel Tree)&quot;. &quot;Jonas and the Sky Tent&quot;, which relates the story of a young boy&#x27;s fantastic experiences in a magical circus bigtop, has been described as Chagall-like poetry. In 2008 his travel book &quot;The West Coast of Europe - a photo travel from Skagen to Gibraltar&quot; was published.

<text>Louis Féraud (13 February 1921 – 28 December 1999) was a French fashion designer and artist.

In 1950, Louis Féraud created his first &quot;Maison de Couture&quot; in Cannes and by 1955 had established a couture house in Paris on 88, Rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré and 57, rue Pierre-Charron.

From the mid-1950s he was dressing the Parisian elite and designed the wardrobe of Brigitte Bardot for many of her movies. It wasn&#x27;t however until 1958 that he presented his first haute couture collection in Paris.

In the early 1960s, Louis Féraud hired the designers Jean-Louis Scherrer, Margit Brandt, and Per Spook.

In 1970, he signed a contract with Fink (Germany) for a ladies&#x27; prêt-à-porter (ready-to-wear) collection. The year 1978 was an excellent one for Féraud: he won the &quot;Golden Thimble Award&quot; for his Spring/Summer 1978 Haute Couture Collection. He went on to claim this accolade again in 1984.

In 1981, he created the fragrance &quot;Fantasque&quot; and selected Avon cosmetics to distribute it in 1982. It was the company&#x27;s first designer perfume and proved to be an instant success. Feraud followed up with two more fragrances created in collaboration with Avon: &quot;Vivage&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Cote d&#x27;Azur&quot; in 1988. 

Meanwhile, his collection of honours continued to grow when Louis Féraud was elected Prince de l&#x27;Art de Vivre in 1991. In 1995, he was decorated Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur, by the French President. His daughter Kiki signed her first Haute Couture collection with Féraud in 1996. In September 1999, the Dutch group Secon acquired Féraud. He died that December, aged 78, after a long and severe battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s.

The year 2000 saw Yvan Mispelaere join the group as artistic director and that July witnessed his first Haute Couture fashion show in &quot;Musée des Monuments Français&quot; in Paris. In 2002, the German Group ESCADA took 90% of the Féraud shares and Yvan Mispelaere left the company. Later that year, Féraud decided to concentrate its activities on ladies&#x27; ready-to-wear and licences, with Jean-Paul Knott selected as Creative Director for the luxury ready-to-wear market.

In 2003, Jean-Paul Knott left Féraud and that July the worldwide flagship store opened in Paris at 400 rue Saint-Honoré.

<text>Zosteraceae (one of the four seagrasses families, Kubitzki ed. 1998) is a family of marine perennial flowering plants found in temperate and subtropical coastal waters, with the highest diversity located around Korea and Japan. Most seagrasses complete their entire life cycle under water, having filamentous pollen especially adapted to dispersion in an aquatic environment and ribbon-like leaves that lack stomata. Seagrasses are herbaceous and have prominent creeping rhizomes. A distinctive characteristic of the family is the presence of characteristic retinacules, which are present in all species except members of &quot;Zostera&quot; subgenus &quot;Zostera&quot;.

Zosteraceae has long been accepted by taxonomists as monophyletic. The APG II system of 2003 recognizes this family and places it in the monocot order Alismatales. The family contains approximately twenty-two species divided between two genera, &quot;Phyllospadix&quot; and &quot;Zostera&quot; totalling 22 known species (Christenhusz &amp; Byng 2016 ). &quot;Zostera&quot; contains three subgenera: &quot;Heterozostera&quot; (formerly considered a separate genus ), &quot;Zostera&quot; and &quot;Zosterella&quot;. Zosteraceae is closely related to Potamogetonaceae, a family of freshwater aquatics.

&quot;Zosteraceae&quot; is a conserved name.

==Taxonomy==

Marine grasses families: Zosteraceae, Cymodoceaceae, Ruppiaceae and Posidoniaceae. Related families: Potamogetonaceae and sometimes including Zannichelliaceae.

<text>Argentière () is a picturesque skiing, alpine walking and mountaineering village in the French Alps, part of the commune of Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, at an altitude of .

==Geography==
Argentière is located near the head of the Valley of Chamonix approximately from Chamonix town. It is connected by road with Switzerland by the pass over the Col des Montets and the Col de la Forclaz to Martigny in the Rhône Valley. The village also lies on the route of the scenic Mont-Blanc Express railway which runs from Saint-Gervais-les-Bains-Le Fayet station through Chamonix, Argentière and Vallorcine before crossing the France–Switzerland border at Le Châtelard, passing through Finhaut before reaching the end of the line in Martigny.

The Argentière Glacier, which lies to the southeast of the village, is bound on its northeast side by the Aiguille du Chardonnet, the Aiguille d&#x27;Argentière and the Tour Noir, as well as on its southwest by the Aiguille Verte, Les Droites and Les Courtes. This area is generally known as the Argentière basin.

==Winter sports==
Argentiere is a popular destination for skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing, attracting many skiers and snowboarders in the winter season – typically mid-December to early May – and is an ideal location for those who seek an exceptional alpine sports experience. The village is an equally popular location in summer season – June to September – for alpine walkers, rock and ice climbers, and as a base for many other alpine sports activities.

Argentière is the starting point for the Téléphérique du Lognan cable car up to Les Grands Montets (), a skiing area famous for its steep and demanding slopes, both on-piste as well as off-piste. In total, the skiing area is served by a cable car (in two sections), a gondola, five chairlifts and some skilifts. Along with the Vallée Blanche, Les Grands Montets draws skiers from all around the world to the Chamonix Valley each and every year.

Because of its central location three other ski areas, the Valle Blanche, Domaine de Balme[Le Tour/Vallorcine] and Brevent/Flegere are a short journey from Argentiere by Chamonix Bus or the Mont Blanc Express local train.

Overall a total of four easily accessible &#x27;snow-sure&#x27; systems, mostly above that together provide more than of marked pistes and trails plus extensive off-piste areas with runs suitable for all grades of skier from Beginner to Advanced.

<text>Tales from the Crypt is a 1972 British horror film directed by Freddie Francis. It is an anthology film consisting of five separate segments, based on short stories from the EC Comics series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; by Al Feldstein, Johnny Craig, and Bill Gaines. The film was produced by Amicus Productions and filmed at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England.

In the film, five strangers (Joan Collins, Ian Hendry, Robin Phillips, Richard Greene and Nigel Patrick) in a crypt encounter the mysterious Crypt Keeper (Ralph Richardson), who makes each person in turn foresee the manner of their death. It is one of several Amicus horror anthologies produced during the 1970s.

==Plot==
Intro

While viewing old catacombs in the English countryside, five strangers stumble into a room with a mysterious Crypt Keeper (Ralph Richardson), who details how each of them will die.

...And All Through the House
* Taken from &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; #35 (February–March 1954).

The beautiful and glamorous Joanne Clayton kills her much older husband Richard on Christmas Eve to collect his insurance. She prepares to hide his body, but is interrupted by a radio announcement of a homicidal maniac lurking in the night. She sees the killer (who is dressed in a Santa Claus costume) outside her home, but cannot call the police without exposing her own crime. She locks up the doors and windows, before dragging her husband’s body and plummeting it down the basement.

After cleaning up the murder scene, Joanne attempts to phone the police (with the intention of making them believe the maniac killed her husband). However, her young daughter Carol — believing the maniac to be Santa — unlocks the door and lets him into the house, whereupon he strangles Joanne to death by the fire.

Reflection of Death
* Taken from &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; #23 (April–May 1951).

Carl Maitland abandons his wife and children to be with his secretary, Susan Blake. After they drive off together, they are involved in a car accident. He wakes up, having been thrown clear of the wrecked and burned car, and attempts to hitchhike home, but everyone he meets reacts with horror upon seeing him.

Arriving at his house, he sees his wife with another man. He knocks on the door, but she screams and slams the door. He then goes to see Susan, only to find that she is blind from the accident. She says that Carl died two years ago in the crash. Glancing at a reflective tabletop, he sees he has the face of a rotting corpse and screams in horror. Carl then wakes up and finds out that it was a dream, but the moment he does, the crash occurs as previously seen.

Poetic Justice
* Taken from &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot; #12 (March–April 1952).

James Elliot lives with his father Edward across from the home of elderly dustman Arthur Edward Grimsdyke, who owns a number of dogs and entertains children in his house with stories and toys. While both the Elliots are snobs who resent Grimsdyke as a blight on their neighbourhood, James strongly detests the old man enough to conduct a smear campaign against him: first having his beloved dogs taken by animal control (although one of them returns to him), then persuading a member of the council to have him removed from his job, and later exploiting parents&#x27; paranoid fears about child molestation. Unbeknownst to James, Grimsdyke dabbles in the occult and holds a seance by himself to confer with his late wife.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day, James sends Grimsdyke a number of poison-pen valentines, supposedly from the neighbours, driving the old man to suicide. Exactly one year later, on Valentine&#x27;s Day, Grimsdyke rises from the grave and takes revenge on James. The next morning, Edward finds his son, bloodied and dead, with a note that reads, &quot;HAPPY VALENTINE&#x27;S DAY..YOU WERE MEAN AND CRUEL..RIGHT FROM THE START..NOW YOU REALLY HAVE NO..&quot; The final word is revealed by James&#x27; still-beating heart inside the folded end of the paper, horrifying Edward.

Wish You Were Here
* Taken from &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot; #22 (November–December 1953). A variation on W. W. Jacobs&#x27;s short story &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;.

Ineffective, ruthless businessman Ralph Jason is close to financial ruin. His wife Enid notices, for the first time, the inscription on a Chinese figurine in the couple&#x27;s collection, which grants three wishes to the owner. Enid decides to wish for a fortune and, surprisingly, the wish comes true, but Ralph is killed, seemingly in a car crash, on the way to his lawyer&#x27;s office to collect the money. The lawyer, Charles Gregory, then advises Enid she will inherit a fortune from her deceased husband&#x27;s life insurance plan; however, when he learns of the manner of the wish granted that she made, he warns her not to wish Ralph back since he remembered the consequences of a similar story in which a mother wished her dead son back, only to be horrified by his gruesome appearance and forced to use the last wish to send him back to the grave. Against Gregory&#x27;s explicit advice, Enid uses her second wish to bring him back to the way he was just before the accident, but he is returned in his coffin, still dead, as his death was due to a heart attack immediately before the crash and caused by fright upon seeing the figure of &quot;death&quot; following him on a motorcycle.

Once more, Gregory warns Enid not to make a final wish and just let Ralph rest in peace. As Gregory goes outside to get some fresh air, she uses her final wish to bring Ralph back to life and to live forever. When Gregory comes back inside, he discovers too late that Enid again went against his warning. Gregory points out to her that Ralph was embalmed and he is suffering from the effects of the embalming liquid. Enid tries to kill Ralph to end his pain but, because she wished for him to live forever, he cannot be killed. As a result, she has now trapped him in eternal agony and thus making her regret those last two wishes.

Blind Alleys
* Taken from &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; #46 (February–March 1955).

Major William Rogers becomes the new director of a home for the blind, and exploits his position to live in luxury with his German Shepherd Shane, while his drastic financial cuts to food and heating reduce the residents&#x27; quality of life. Rogers gets his comeuppance after he ignores the pleas of resident George Carter to both make the living conditions more bearable and later to get medical treatment for fellow resident Greenwood, who then dies from hypothermia. Carter leads a revolt to subdue the staff before locking Rogers and Shane in separate rooms in the basement, and they then construct a small maze of narrow corridors between the two rooms. After going over two days without food, Rogers is released and forced to find his way through the maze for his freedom, getting past one corridor lined with razor blades once Carter turns the lights on; but Rogers finds his last obstacle to be a ravenous Shane who does not seem to recognise him. He flees back towards the razors, only for Carter to turn the lights off. Rogers is heard screaming as the hungry dog catches up with him and kills him.

Finale

After completing the final tale, the Crypt Keeper reveals that he was not warning them of what would happen, but instead telling them what has already happened: that they have all &quot;died without repentance&quot;. There is one clue to this twist in that Joan Collins&#x27; character is wearing the brooch her husband had given her for Christmas just before she killed him. The door to Hell opens and Joanne, Carl, James, Ralph, and Major Rogers all enter (Ralph enters first and is seen falling down into a fiery abyss). &quot;And now, who&#x27;s next?&quot; asks the Crypt Keeper, turning to face the camera as he says &quot;Perhaps...YOU?&quot; The scene pulls away as the entrance to the Crypt Keeper&#x27;s lair is in flames.

===Funding===
The budget of £170,000 was higher than usual for an Amicus production, and was partly funded by American International Pictures.

===Casting===
Peter Cushing was originally offered the part played by Richard Greene, but wanted to try something different and played the elderly Grimsdyke instead.

===Filming===
Filming started on 13 September 1971 and finished in 1972.

==Release==
===Premieres===
The film premièred in North America on 8 March 1972, and in the UK on 28 September 1972.

===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s put together something like the comic books, with the old Crypt Keeper acting as host and narrator. In the movie version, he is played with suitable ham by Ralph Richardson&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the film lacked style and was too heavy-handed in its morality.

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: &quot;This excellent anthology of scares-with-a-smile stories drawn from EC horror comics has Ralph Richardson as the crypt keeper revealing a quintet of fearsome futures to a veteran British cast of terror troupers. ... Ace direction by genre favourite Freddie Francis adeptly leavens the horror with serio-comic interludes.&quot;

In retrospective reviews, Craig Butler of AllMovie said, &quot;It has a certain magnetism about it that is hard to resist and which accounts for its enduring popularity. There&#x27;s something about &quot;Crypt&quot; that makes even jaded viewers feel like they&#x27;re kids sitting in their rooms late at night with the lights out, telling eerie tales with the aid of a flashlight.&quot;

Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; rated it two-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that &quot;the undercurrent of sternness is tempered by a truly bottomless roster of campy excess&quot;.

Anthony Arrigo of Dread Central wrote, &quot;The greatest strength in &quot;Tales&quot; comes not from the acting or directing – both of which are perfectly sound – but in the rich stories culled from the comics.&quot;

Chris Alexander of &quot;Fangoria&quot; wrote, &quot;[F]rom its first frames to its invasive final shot, this classic British creeper offers an unrelenting study in the art of the macabre.&quot;

, Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reported that 90% of 21 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7.07/10.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS in North America by Prism Entertainment Corp in 1985, then by Starmaker Home Video in 1989, and finally by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, under their Selections label, in 1998.

In the UK, it was released on VHS in 1988 by CBS Fox Video, having been rated 18 without cuts by the BBFC.

It was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2010. It received its first Blu-ray release from Shock Records distribution in Australia on 2 November 2011.

The film, paired with another Amicus anthology, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, was released on a double-feature DVD on 11 September 2007. Shout! Factory released the same double feature on Blu-ray on 2 December 2014.

==Points of interest==
* Only two of the stories are from EC&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; comic book. The reason for this, according to &quot;Creepy&quot; founding editor Russ Jones, is that producer Milton Subotsky did not own a run of the original EC comic book but instead adapted the movie from the two paperback reprints given to him by Jones. The story &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was reprinted in the paperback collection &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; (Ballantine, 1965). The other four stories in the movie were among the eight stories reprinted in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (Ballantine, 1964).
* Richardson&#x27;s hooded Crypt Keeper, more sombre than the EC original (as illustrated by Al Feldstein and Jack Davis), has a monk-like appearance and resembles EC&#x27;s GhouLunatics. In the EC horror comics, the other horror hosts (the Old Witch and the Vault Keeper) wore hoods, while the Crypt Keeper did not.
* The earlier Amicus anthology film &quot;Torture Garden&quot; features a similar ending breaking the fourth wall.
* The screenplay was adapted into a tie-in novel by Jack Oleck, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (Bantam, 1972). Oleck, who wrote the novel &quot;Messalina&quot; (1950), also scripted for EC&#x27;s Picto-Fiction titles, &quot;Crime Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Shock Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Terror Illustrated&quot;. A tie-in novel was also written by Oleck for the later Amicus anthology film &quot;The Vault Of Horror&quot;, released in 1973.

==Connections to the television series==

&quot;...And All Through the House&quot;, &quot;Blind Alleys&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; were all somewhat remade into episodes for the &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot; television show. &quot;Blind Alleys&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; were both changed.

* &quot;...And All Through the House&quot; had the woman killing her husband so that she can take her daughter and live with her boyfriend. The episode ended with her daughter letting the axe-wielding maniac into the house as he quotes &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; with the episode ending with the woman screaming. The Crypt Keeper stated that the daughter was not harmed because the escaped maniac “preferred older women... in pieces”.
* &quot;Blind Alleys&quot; was now &quot;Revenge is the Nuts&quot; and was about a beautiful blind girl (portrayed by Teri Polo) who comes to live at a house for the blind where the sadistic director (played by &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;″s Anthony Zerbe) tries to sexually assault her. In the end, she and the other residents take their revenge on the director in the same fashion as in the original story.
* &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is similar to the TV series&#x27; 7th-season episode &quot;Last Respects&quot; in that both borrow plot elements from W. W. Jacobs&#x27;s classic short story &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot; and both are directed by the original film&#x27;s director Freddie Francis. Like many of the show&#x27;s episodes, &quot;Last Respects&quot; uses the title of an existing story from the comics (&quot;Tales From The Crypt&quot; #23), but does not use the story itself. The statue from the film is reverted to the original monkey&#x27;s paw in the TV episode, and the story now deals with three sisters who come into possession of it. One wishes for 1 million pounds, and she and the second sister are in a car crash where she dies, and her life insurance policy is for 1 million pounds. When the third sister wishes that the dead sister was the way she was just before the crash, she learns that she was actually killed by the second sister. In a form of revenge, the third sister gives her last wish to her sister, but she did not say &quot;which&quot; sister she wanted to give it to, thus beating the monkey&#x27;s paw at its own game. The third wish is transferred to the dead sister, who comes back from the dead to kill the second sister.

<text>Jesse Hubbard (born September 18, 1975) is a former professional lacrosse player who played professional box lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League (NLL) and professional field lacrosse in the Major League Lacrosse (MLL).

==Background==
Hubbard starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men&#x27;s lacrosse team from 1995 through 1998, where he earned Ivy League Player of the Year, Ivy League Rookie of the Year, three All-American recognitions from the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA), four Ivy League championships, and three national championships. He holds Princeton&#x27;s lacrosse scoring records for both career and single-season goals. In high school, he had set the Interstate Athletic Conference (IAC) scoring record, while playing for St. Albans School and becoming &quot;The Washington Post&quot; boys&#x27; lacrosse player of the year.

As a professional, he was the MLL&#x27;s leading goal scorer for its first three seasons and its all-time goal leader as recently as the 2010 MLL season. His 54 goals in 2002 continue to be a league single-season record. He is a five-time Major League Lacrosse All-Star. In August 2010, he was selected to the MLL 10th Anniversary team. He has represented Team USA in the World Lacrosse Championships and is an ambassador of the sport both through service with Warrior Sports and his own annual youth camps.

Hubbard got his first lacrosse stick when he was 11 or 12 years old. Hubbard played middle and high school lacrosse at St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)., where he was a captain and earned All-Metropolitan and All-American honors. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named Hubbard to the 1993 All-Met Boys&#x27; Lacrosse First Team as a midfielder after he led the IAC in goals with 59 as a junior. Then, when as a senior Hubbard became the All-time IAC goal scorer with 217, they named him the 1994 All-Met Boys&#x27; Lacrosse Team Player of the Year.

==College career==
When Hubbard went to Princeton, he was expected to be one of the key incoming midfielders. Hubbard became was part of a trio of revered attackmen who were Princeton classmates along with Jon Hess and Chris Massey. As starters, the trio of All-Americans, which retired second (Hess), third (Hubbard) and fourth (Massey) in career points at Princeton, had a 43–2 record and combined for 618 points. He was a first team USILA All-American Team selection in 1996 and 1998 and second team selection in 1997. He was also first team All-Ivy League in 1996 (when he was Ivy League Player of the Year), 1997 and 1998 and a second team selection in 1995 (when he was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year). The 1995 team, which earned the school&#x27;s sixth consecutive NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship invitation, was Ivy League co-champion, while the 1996–1998 teams were 6–0 undefeated outright conference champions. These undefeated league champions won the 1996, 1997 and 1998 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championships, becoming the first team to threepeat since Syracuse from 1988–90 and the first to be recognized to have done so without an NCAA scandal since Johns Hopkins from 1978–80.

In 1996, he earned co-Ivy League Player of the year by recording six or more goals four times during the regular season. In the 1996 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship tournament quarterfinals 22–6 victory over Towson State, Hubbard again scored six goals. Hubbard added three more goals in the championship game against Virginia including the first goal and the final goal in overtime of the 13–12 victory. In the 1997 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship tournament quarterfinals, he again scored six goals in an 11–9 victory over the UMass. He scored in the semifinal 10–9 victory over Duke, and he scored four goals in the 19–7 championship victory against Maryland. The 1997 team is regarded as the best in school history with a record number of wins during its 15–0 season. He served as co-captain of the 1998 team. He scored three goals in the 1998 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship tournament 11–10 semifinal victory over Syracuse. He also scored four goals and added six assists in the 15–5 championship game victory over Maryland.

When Hubbard was on the field, the Princeton offense was explosive. Hubbard holds the Princeton University single-season (53, 1996) and career (163, 1995–98) goals records. He also broke Kevin Lowe&#x27;s school single-season points record of 69 in 1996 by three, but Hess broke the record in 1997 with 76 points. Hubbard&#x27;s 23 goals as a freshman was a Princeton freshman record until B. J. Prager posted 25 in 1999. Hubbard threatened the Ivy League record for career goals in conference games needing just eight in his final two games, but as of 2010, Jon Reese&#x27;s 1990 record remained on the books. He was named number 11 of the top 20 athletes in Princeton Tiger history by the &quot;Daily Princetonian&quot;.

==Professional career==
Hubbard represented Team USA in the 1998 World Lacrosse Championship. Hubbard also played in the National Lacrosse League for the Baltimore Thunder (1999), Pittsburgh CrosseFire (2000) and Washington Power (2001). In 1999, he was named NLL Rookie of the Year. In the 1999 World Cup, Hubbard scored a goal to give Team USA and 8–7 lead over Team Canada in a 20–10 victory to sweep the event.

Hubbard was a member of the New Jersey Pride from 2001 until 2007. Prior to the 2008 MLL season, Hubbard was traded to the Los Angeles Riptide in exchange for a first round 2009 MLL Collegiate Draft pick. Hubbard played for the Los Angeles Riptide during the 2008 season. After the 2008 season, Hubbard was assigned to the Washington Bayhawks (now Chesapeake Bayhawks). Prior to the start of the 2009 season with the Bayhawks, Hubbard suffered a herniated disc and was unable to play the 2009 season. Hubbard has not played in the MLL since.

In 2000, the MLL organized a Major League Lacrosse Summer Showcase, which was a seven-game promotional series to introduce the first outdoor professional lacrosse league set to begin play the following year. Hubbard was one of the 40 players selected to promote the league. When the MLL began its first season in 2001, Hubbard was instrumental in marketing the league looking to showcase premium talent. Hubbard led the MLL in scoring each season from 2001 to 2003, and was named to the MLL All-Star Team 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006. In the 2002 All-Star game he scored a goal to break a 16–16 tie in a 21–16 victory for the National Division All-Stars over the American Division All-Stars. When he surpassed his 2001 total of 44 goals with 54 at the end of the 2002 season, it established a league single-season goals record that continues to survive through the 2010 MLL season and his 2003 season total of 50 goals continues to be the only other 50-goal season in league history. The MLL schedule was reduced from 14 games to 12 in 2003, meaning that Hubbard&#x27;s 50 goals is the record for a 12-game season. The closest anyone has come to his single-season goal scoring record was John Grant&#x27;s 47-goal 2008 season. As a result of having been the goals scored leader for the MLL&#x27;s first three-season, he built up a career goals scored lead that stood up until during the 2005 season when Mark Millon took a 206–193 lead in career goals scored. However, Millon only scored five goals in 2007 when his career came to an end. In July 2008, Hubbard surpassed Millon&#x27;s career total of 239 by reaching 247. On August 1, 2010, Tim Goettelmann surpassed Hubbard with his 246th, 247th and 248th career goals. In August 2010, Hubbard was selected to the MLL 10th anniversary team.

Hubbard is a spokesman for Warrior Sports and annually runs the Jesse Hubbard Experience, a youth lacrosse camp for boys ages 9–17 held each summer at George Mason University.

==Personal==
Hubbard has an older brother named Andy. Andy was a midfielder on the 1992 and 1994 teams that earned Princeton&#x27;s first two NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championships.

<doc id="1069951" wikidata="Q686319" url="?curid=1069951" title="Westhoughton">
<text>Westhoughton ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, Greater Manchester, England, southwest of Bolton, east of Wigan and northwest of Manchester.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, Westhoughton was once a centre for coal mining, cotton-spinning and textile manufacture. It had a population of 24,974 at the 2011 Census.

Westhoughton incorporates several former villages and hamlets which have their own distinctive character, sports traditions and amenities, including Wingates, White Horse, Over Hulton, Four Gates, Chequerbent, Hunger Hill, Snydale, Hart Common, Marsh Brook, Daisy Hill and Dobb Brow.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Westhoughton is derived from the Old English, &quot;halh&quot; (dialectal &quot;haugh&quot;) for a nook or corner of land, and &#x27;tun&#x27; for a farmstead or settlement – meaning a &quot;westerly settlement in a corner of land&quot;. It has been recorded variously as &quot;Halcton&quot; in 1210, &quot;Westhalcton&quot; in 1240, &quot;Westhalghton&quot; in 1292, &quot;Westhalton&quot; in 1302 and in the 16th-century as &quot;Westhaughton&quot; and &quot;Westhoughton&quot;.

The people of Westhoughton are sometimes known as &quot;Howfeners&quot; (from Houghton) or &quot;Keaw-yeds&quot; (cow heads) or &quot;Keawyedners&quot; (a combination of the two), and the town is known as &quot;Keawyed City&quot;. Supposed folklore (&quot;re-invented&quot; in the Edwardian period) describes a farmer who found his cow with its head stuck in a five barred gate, and, rather than damage the gate, cut the cow&#x27;s head off, as the cow cost less than the gate. The village of Tideswell in Derbyshire shares this same legend.

===Banastre Rebellion===
In 1315, a group of men led by Sir William Bradshaigh of Haigh Hall, Sir Henry Lea of Charnock Richard and Sir Adam Banastre met at Wingates to plan a campaign of violence against Sir Robert de Holland of Upholland, chief retainer of the powerful Earl of Lancaster. The campaign came to be known as the Banastre Rebellion and ended with the deaths of most of the main protagonists.

===Civil War===
On 15 December 1642, during the English Civil War, the Battle of Warcock Hill was fought on Westhoughton Common between Lord Derby&#x27;s Cavalier forces and Parliamentarians. The site of the battle was off the Manchester Road where Wayfaring is today. The Parliamentarians under Captains Bradshaw, Venables and Browne ran into a force of some thousand Royalists from the Wigan garrison under Lord Derby and were forced to surrender. The three captains and 160 men were taken prisoner.

It is believed that Prince Rupert of the Rhine gathered his troops in Westhoughton before the attack and ensuing massacre at Bolton in 1644. Civil War activity is also known to have occurred around the site of Hunger Hill and a sword claimed to be from the time of the Civil War was discovered in the garden of one of the cottages at Pocket Nook in Chew Moor during the 1950s.

===Industrial Revolution===

On 25 March 1812, a group of Luddites burned Rowe and Dunscough&#x27;s Westhoughton Mill. Twelve people were arrested on the orders of William Hulton, the High Sheriff of Lancashire. James Smith, Thomas Kerfoot, John (or Job) Fletcher and Abraham Charlston, were sentenced to death for their part in the attack. The Charlston family claimed that Abraham was only 12 years old; but he was not reprieved. The men were publicly hanged outside Lancaster Castle on 13 June 1812. It was reported that Abraham cried for his mother on the scaffold. By this time, however, hanging of those under 18 was rare and of those under 16, in practice, abolished. Nine others were transported to Australia. The riots are commemorated by a blue plaque on the White Lion public house opposite the mill site.

In 1891, the Rose Hill Doubling Mill had 8,020 spindles and Higson and Biggs&#x27; Victoria Mill had 40,000 spindles.
Bolton Road Mill housed 564 looms weaving shirtings and Perseverance Mill had 600 looms manufacturing twills, sateens and plain cotton cloth. The looms in John Chadwick&#x27;s Silk Mills produced broad silks, tie silks, scarves and handkerchiefs. The Lancashire Hosiery Company produced vests. Thomas Welch was a calico printer at the Green Vale Print Works.

The family of William Hulton of Hulton Park owned many small collieries from the 16th-century. After 1828 the pits at Chequerbent were served by the Bolton and Leigh Railway. The Hulton Colliery Company sank Chequerbent Colliery in 1892 and Bank Pit Nos 1–4 between 1897 and 1901. The company mined the Trencherbone, Plodder and Arley seams. Bank Pit No 3, known as the Pretoria Pit, was the site of one Britain&#x27;s worst coal-mining disasters when on 21 December 1910, 344 men and boys died in an explosion of firedamp. The Pretoria Pit Disaster was the third worst in British mining history, after the 1866 Barnsley Oaks Disaster in Yorkshire, which killed 361 miners, and the 1913 Senghenydd Colliery Disaster in Glamorgan, which killed 439. A memorial erected in 1910 is Grade II listed.

In 1896, the Wigan Coal and Iron Company&#x27;s Eatock Pits employed 484 underground and 89 surface workers whilst the Hewlett Pits, at Hart Common, employed 981 underground and 182 on the surface.

==Governance==
Lying within the boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th-century, Westhoughton was a chapelry and township in the ecclesiastical parish of Deane, in the Salford hundred. In 1837, Westhoughton joined with other townships (or civil parishes) to form the Bolton Poor Law Union and took joint responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area. In 1872, a Local board of health was established for the township, but was superseded in 1894 by the creation of Westhoughton Urban District which shared local government responsibilities with Lancashire County Council. In 1898, most of Over Hulton became part of the urban district. Westhoughton Town Hall was built in 1903 to a plan by Bradshaw and Gass, architects of Bolton replacing the Local Board Offices at the junction of Market Street and Wigan Road.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, Westhoughton Urban District was abolished in 1974 and its area became a civil parish of the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester. It is represented by six councillors elected in two borough wards – Westhoughton North and Chew Moor and Westhoughton South – on the metropolitan borough council.

Westhoughton civil parish gained town council status in 1985, and has 18 town councillors elected from six town council wards – Central, Chequerbent, Daisy Hill, Hoskers and Hart Common, White Horse, and Wingates. Each year the town council elects a town mayor.

===Parliamentary representation===
For 98 years between 1885 and 1983, the Westhoughton constituency represented the town. Although, since 1906, always returning a Labour candidate, the elections were, after 1950, a close run contest, due to the working class conservatism found in Westhoughton and surrounding areas and the inclusion of more rural (Conservative) areas in boundary revision. At the 1906 general election, the birth of the modern Labour Party, William Tyson Wilson was one of 29 successful Labour Representation Committee candidates.

The constituency had by-elections in 1921, 1951 and 1973 due to the retirement, ill-health or death of the sitting MPs. The last MP for Westhoughton was Roger Stott (Labour) who, on abolition of the Westhoughton constituency, was elected MP for Wigan in 1983.

The 1983 redistribution of seats reflected local government reforms made in 1974. In September 2011, the Boundary Commission for England proposed recreating a Westhoughton constituency to incorporate Westhoughton, Blackrod, Hindley, Atherton, and parts of Horwich and Leigh

==Geography==
Westhoughton covers an area of and has an average breadth of over from north-east to south-west, and an extreme length of nearly from northwest to south-east. The highest ground at over is to the north east with the land sloping downwards to the south-west. The lowest point at about is in the extreme southerly corner. Borsdane Brook separates the township from Aspull, another brook divides it from Hindley joining a stream which rises on the northern edge of Westhoughton and flows south through Leigh to Glazebrook. The town incorporates several former villages and hamlets including railway stations including Wingates, White Horse, Over Hulton, Four Gates (or Fourgates), Chequerbent, Hunger Hill, Snydale, Hart Common, Marsh Brook, Daisy Hill and Dobb Brow.

Local Nature Reserves are located at Hall Lee Bank Park, Cunningham Clough, and Eatock Lodge at Daisy Hill.

==Demography==
==Education==

The long established St John&#x27;s, Wingates CE Primary &amp; Fourgates County Primary schools were closed in 2004 following amalgamation to form The Gates CP School. Westhoughton CP School closed in 2008. An earlier round of reorganisation saw the closure of Hart Common Primary School and opening of St George&#x27;s on The Hoskers, and the closure of the tiny County Primary at White Horse which is now a private nursery.

==Religion==
Westhoughton&#x27;s old chapel of 1552 was replaced by a brick-built church in 1731 and the parish church in 1869–70. Dedicated to Saint Bartholomew, it had an east window depicting the twelve apostles. In 1990, the church was gutted by fire, but the tower was saved, and is Grade II listed. A new church, designed by architects Dane, Ashworth &amp; Cottam, was built at a cost of about £1 million, and consecrated in 1995 by the Bishop of Manchester. Nicholsons of Malvern built its two manual organs with 1,256 pipes, ranging from 1/2 inch to made of tin, spotted metal and hammered lead.

Other Anglican churches include St John the Evangelist, in the Parish of Wingates, and St James the Great, in the Parish of Daisy Hill. St James&#x27; is a Grade II* listed building. 

The Roman Catholic Sacred Heart parish church fell into disrepair; it was demolished and replaced by a new building incorporating a church hall.
John Wesley preached a sermon at Barnaby&#x27;s Farm in Wingates in 1784. Services were held in cottages opposite the farm before the first Methodist church was built in 1835. Another Methodist Church was built in Dixon Street in 1871. Houses occupy the site of Westhoughton Independent Methodist Church, where Wesley once stood, but the stone, from which he preached, was moved to Grove Lane Chapel, now Westhoughton Methodist Church&#x27;s church hall. The final service was held by the Independent Methodist Church in 2001 and the church was subsequently demolished. Daisy Hill Methodist Church was closed and demolished in the late 1980s. The new, Methodist church was built adjacent to Grove Lane Chapel, which now serves as church hall.

The industrial north west was a focus for non-conformism, and until the 1990s the Church of the Nazarene stood in Church Street. The Quaker Meeting House is now a Christian fellowship, and a tin tabernacle was situated off Bolton Road. There is a Pentecostal church, a United Reformed Church, The Bethel, and an independent church on Tithbarn Street.

==Landmarks==

Snydle water tower was built by Westhoughton Council in 1914 and lay derelict for many years with its tank removed and the tower open to the sky. It has been restored and converted into a private dwelling that is visible from the M61 motorway.

The Church of England School built in 1861, opposite St Bartholomew&#x27;s church, is a Grade II listed building as are houses at 110 and 112, Market Street. The school, which was known as Westhoughton Parochial School, has been renamed St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church of England, Primary School.

The red brick and terracotta town hall and Carnegie library were built between 1902 and 1904 to the designs of Bradshaw &amp; Gass.

==Transport==
The M61 motorway passes through the north of the town which it serves by junctions 5 and 6. The A58 and the A6 cross the town as do the B5236, the B5235, and the B5239. The motorway separated the townships of Hunger Hill and Chew Moor from the rest of Westhoughton and the Bolton Road was completely severed. A new link road, Snydale Way, was built between Chequerbent and a spur to the old Bolton Road, via a roundabout at M61 junction 5. Snydale Way, a broad, dual carriageway, was built to full four lane motorway standard, with a broad centre verge allowing widening to six lanes. The original intention was that it would form the beginning of a new motorway, running southwest, linking the M61 with the M6. Although the route was fully allocated and all planning and public consultation completed, the project was shelved due to financial constraints.

Westhoughton railway station and Daisy Hill railway station are served by Northern trains between and Manchester. Westhoughton is served by 2tph westbound to Southport via Wigan, 1tph eastbound to Stalybridge via Manchester Victoria and 1tph eastbound to Manchester Oxford Road. Daisy Hill is served by 2tph westbound to Wigan Wallgate (with 1tph continuing to Headbolt Lane) and 2tph eastbound to Todmorden via Manchester Victoria with 1tph continuing to Blackburn and 1tph continuing to Leeds via Brighouse. Trains from Daisy Hill run via Atherton, trains from Westhoughton run via Bolton. Formerly there were stations at (closed 1952) Dicconson Lane and Hilton House both closed in 1954.
In the late 1980s, a railway station was planned for Dobb Brow but never built. and stations, to the north, also serve the town. The annual usage of Daisy Hill and Westhoughton stations was more than 500,000 passengers in 2013/14, greater than many major UK towns.
Electric trams to Bolton served Westhoughton until 1947 after 23 years of service. On 19 December 1924, the Bolton to Deane service was extended to Westhoughton.

All bus services in Westhoughton are part of Transport for Greater Manchester&#x27;s Bee Network. Go North West operates service 520 between Bolton and Westhoughton via Ladybridge, then operating as a circular service to Wingates and Westhoughton before returning to Bolton, as well as the most frequent service 607 (formerly 7) from Bolton to Wigan via Hindley. The remainder of services are operated by Diamond North West, those being service 516 between Leigh and Horwich via Atherton and Middlebrook, service 521 between Little Lever and Blackrod via Farnworth and Royal Bolton Hospital, and service 559 between Bolton and Ashton-in-Makerfield via Daubhill, Hindley and Platt Bridge. Services 520, 559 and 607 serve Bolton Interchange for further bus and rail connections to areas such as Bury, Preston, Manchester and Chorley.

==Media==
The weekly &quot;Horwich and Westhoughton Journal&quot; was published (by &quot;The Bolton News&quot;) from 1925 until 1980, and had an editorial and revenue office in Market Street.

The town&#x27;s Carnegie library is at the rear of the Town Hall. Its Carnegie Hall is used for meetings and other activities. A small museum has exhibits that relate to the Pretoria Pit Disaster and a large, encased model, of the original St Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church, built from match-sticks.
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the nearby Winter Hill TV transmitter situated north of the town.

<text> () is a term which means &quot;lineage&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese and has historically been used as a racial and social identifier. In the context of the Spanish Empire in the Americas, the term also refers to a now-discredited 20th-century theoretical framework which postulated that colonial society operated under a hierarchical race-based &quot;caste system&quot;. From the outset, colonial Spanish America resulted in widespread intermarriage: unions of Spaniards (), indigenous people (), and Africans (). Basic mixed-race categories that appeared in official colonial documentation were , generally offspring of a Spaniard and an Indigenous person; and , offspring of a Spaniard and an African. A plethora of terms were used for people with mixed Spanish, Indigenous, and African ancestry in 18th-century casta paintings, but they are not known to have been widely used officially or unofficially in the Spanish Empire.
== Etymology ==
 is an Iberian word (existing in Spanish, Portuguese and other Iberian languages since the Middle Ages), meaning &#x27;lineage&#x27;. It was first documented in Spanish in 1417 and is linked to the Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;. The Portuguese gave rise to the English word &quot;caste&quot; during the early modern period.
==Use of Casta terminology==
In the historical literature, how racial distinction, hierarchy, and social status functioned over time in colonial Spanish America has been an evolving and contested discussion. Although the term (system of castes) or (&quot;society of castes&quot;) are utilized in modern historical analyses to describe the social hierarchy based on race, with Spaniards at the apex, archival research shows that there is not a rigid &quot;system&quot; with fixed places for individuals. Rather, there existed a more fluid social structure where individuals could move from one category to another, or maintain or be given different labels depending on the context. In the 18th century, &quot;casta paintings&quot;, imply a fixed racial hierarchy, but this genre may well have been an attempt to bring order into a system that was more fluid. &quot;For colonial elites, casta paintings might well have been an attempt to fix in place rigid divisions based on race, even as they were disappearing in social reality.&quot;
Examination of registers in colonial Mexico put in question other narratives held by certain academics, such as Spanish immigrants who arrived to Mexico being almost exclusively men or that &quot;pure Spanish&quot; people were all part of a small powerful elite. Spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities and there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete Spanish origin.
In New Spain (colonial Mexico) during the Mexican War of Independence, race and racial distinctions were an important issue and the end of imperial had a strong appeal. José María Morelos, who was registered as a Spaniard in his baptismal records, called for the abolition of the formal distinctions the imperial regime made between racial groups, advocating for &quot;calling them one and all Americans.&quot; Morelos issued regulations in 1810 to prevent ethnic-based disturbances. &quot;He who raises his voice should be immediately punished.&quot; In 1821 race was an issue in the negotiations resulting in the Plan of Iguala.
==&quot;Colonial Caste System&quot; debate==
The degree to which racial category labels had legal and social consequences has been subject to academic debate since the idea of a &quot;caste system&quot; was first developed by Polish-Venezuelan philologist Ángel Rosenblat and Mexican anthropologist Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán in the 1940s. Both authors popularized the notion that racial status was the key organizing principle of Spanish colonial rule, a theory which became commonplace in the anglosphere during the latter half of the 20th century. However, recent academic studies in Latin America have widely challenged this notion, considering it a flawed and ideologically-based reinterpretation of the colonial period, as follows.
Pilar Gonzalbo, in her study (2013) discards the idea of the existence of a &quot;caste system&quot; or a &quot;caste society&quot; in New Spain, understood as a &quot;social organization based on the race and supported by coercive power&quot;. She also affirms in her work that certain subliminal and derogatory messages in caste paintings were not a general phenomenon, and that they only began to be carried out in particular environments of the Criollo oligarchies after the Bourbon Reformism and the influx of ideas of scientific racism from the illustration within some encyclopedic environments of the colonial bourgeoisie.
Joanne Rappaport, in her book on colonial New Granada, &quot;The Disappearing Mestizo&quot;, rejects the caste system as an interpretative framework for that time, discussing both the legitimacy of a model valid for the entire colonial world and the usual association between &quot;caste&quot; and &quot;race&quot;.
Similarly, Berta Ares&#x27; 2015 study on the Viceroyalty of Peru, notes that the term &quot;casta&quot; was barely used by colonial authorities which, according to her, casts doubt on the existence of a &quot;caste system&quot;. Even by the 18th century, its use was rare and appeared in its plural form, &quot;castas&quot;, characterized by its ambiguous meaning. The word did not specifically refer to sectors of the population who were of mixed race, but also included both Spaniards and indigenous people of lower socio-economic extraction, often used together with other terms such as plebe, vulgo, naciones, clases, calidades, otras gentes, etc.
Ben Vinson, in a study of the historical archives of Mexico carried out in 2018, addressing the issue of racial diversity in Mexico and its relationship with imperial Spain, ratified these conclusions.
Often called the or the , there was, in fact, no fixed system of classification for individuals, as careful archival research has shown. There was considerable fluidity in society, with the same individuals being identified by different categories simultaneously or over time. Individuals self-identified by particular terms, often to shift their status from one category to another to their advantage. For example, both and Spaniards were exempt from tribute obligations, but were both equally subject to the Inquisition. , on the other hand, paid tribute yet were exempt from the Inquisition. In certain cases, a might try to &quot;pass&quot; as an to escape the Inquisition. An might try to pass as a to escape tribute obligations.
Casta paintings produced largely in 18th-century Mexico have influenced modern understandings of race in Spanish America, a concept which began infiltrating Bourbon Spain from France and Northern Europe during this time. They purport to show a fixed &quot;system&quot; of racial hierarchy which has been disputed by modern academia. These paintings should be evaluated as the production by elites in New Spain for an elite viewership in both Spanish territories and abroad portrayals of mixtures of Spaniards with other ethnicities, some of which have been interpreted as being pejorative in nature or seeking social outrage. They are thus useful for understanding elites and their attitudes toward non-elites, and quite valuable as illustrations of aspects of material culture in the late colonial era.
The process of mixing ancestries by the union of people of different races is known in the modern era as &quot;&quot; ( , ). In Spanish colonial law, mixed-race castas were classified as part of the and not the , which set indigenous people outside the Hispanic sphere with different duties and rights to those of Spaniards and Mestizos.
The caste system for these historians would have been misconstrued as being analogous to the castes of India. Given that in viceregal Spanish America there was never a closed system based on birth rights, where the birth rate and, therefore, wealth, created a &quot;caste system&quot; difficult to penetrate; but, rather, the statute of (a concept of religious root and not biological or racial) was given, in which the Indian and the mestizo, as a new Christian, had limitations on access to certain trades until assimilation full of his conversion to Catholicism; but that did not prevent his social ascent, and he would even receive protections that would benefit his social mobilization, protections that the old Christian of the would not enjoy (such as being free from all the taxes of the whites, with the exception of the indigenous tribute, or be exempt from the Holy Inquisition). Then, those conceptions of a &quot;caste society&quot; or a &quot;caste system&quot; as characteristic of colonial society would be completely anachronistic formulations and could be part of the Spanish Black Legend. Given this, in works prior to those of Rosenblat and Beltrán, one would not find references to the notion that the Spanish empire was a society founded on racial segregation. Neither in Nicolás León, Gregorio Torres Quintero, Blanchard, nor in the Catalog of Herrera and Cicero (1895), nor in the article &quot;Castas&quot; of the Dictionary of History and Geography (1855), nor in Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s Political Essay on the Spanish-American territories that he visited on his scientific expeditions. Among other works that refer to the existence of castes and caste paintings, without implying connotations with modern racism, which would come to America after the French Enlightenment.
This would make these critics conclude that those colonial societies were rather of the class type, that although there was a relationship between class and race through castes, that was not in a cause relationship, but in a consequence relationship (not being an end in itself the race, which was understood in the Hispanic tradition as something purely spiritual, not so much biological). The purpose of the castas was to register the identity of lineages to register them in the republic of Spaniards, the republic of Indians, with the services and privileges acquired, which would not disturb the economic potential of the individual of the caste, nor would they have the purpose of to formally segregate them from positions of power, but to hierarchize them in feudal society (not equivalent to the same thing, as long as they were not prevented from ascending to the nobility or being part of the commercial petty bourgeoisie). Then, the viceroyalty society would be a society of &quot;quality&quot;, estate, corporate, patronage and trade union, where each social group was not conditioned by their race, and neither did this establish the labor relations of its inhabitants. In the parish registers there would never have been the tendency to classify in so many innumerable mixtures as seen in the caste charts, which would be an artistic phenomenon typical of the Age of Enlightenment.
Some examples of blacks, mulattoes and mestizos who climbed socially would be used as evidence against these misrepresentations, such as: Juan Latino, Juan Valiente, Juan Garrido, Juan García, Juan Bardales, Sebastián Toral, Antonio Pérez, Miguel Ruíz, Gómez de León, Fran Dearobe, José Manuel Valdés, Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo. Names of indigenous chiefs and noble mestizos are also mentioned: Carlos Inca, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Manuela Taurichumbi Saba Cápac Inca, Alonso de Castilla Titu Atauchi Inga, Alonso de Areanas Florencia Inca, Gonzalo Tlaxhuexolotzin, Vicente Xicohténcatl, Bartolomé Zitlalpopoca, Lorenzo Nahxixcalzin , Doña Luisa Xicotencatl, Nicolás de San Luis Montañez, Fernando de Tapia, Isabel Moctezuma Tecuichpo Ixcaxochitzin, Pedro de Moctezuma. The Royal Decree of Philip II on 1559 is also often mentioned, in which it is prescribed that &quot;the mestizos who come to these kingdoms to study, or for other things of their use (...) do not need another license to return.&quot; The document is important, because laws are not made for particular cases and it shows that the existence of multiple castes did not impede social mobilization within the Hispanic monarchy, the same mobilization that must have been significant to require the attention of a royal edict of the person of the Spanish king.

==&quot;Purity of blood&quot; and the evolution of racial classification==
Certain authors have sought to link the castas in Latin America to the older Spanish concept of &quot;purity of blood&quot;, , which developed in Christian Spain to denote those without recent Jewish or Muslim heritage or, more widely, heritage from individuals convicted by the Spanish inquisition for heresy.
It was directly linked to religion and notions of legitimacy, lineage and honor following Spain&#x27;s reconquest of Moorish territory and the degree to which it can be considered a precursor to the modern concept of race has been the subject of academic debate. The Inquisition only allowed those Spaniards who could demonstrate not to have Jewish and Moorish blood to emigrate to Latin America, although this prohibition was frequently ignored and a number of Spanish Conquistadors were Jewish Conversos. Others, such as Juan Valiente, were Black Africans or had recent Moorish ancestry.
Both in Spain and in the New World, Conversos who continued to practice Judaism in secret were aggressively prosecuted. Of the roughly 40 people executed by the Spanish Inquisition in Mexico, a significant number were convicted of being &quot;Judaizers&quot; () . Spanish Conquistador Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva was prosecuted by the Inquisition for secretly practising Judaism and eventually died in prison.
In Spanish America, the idea of purity of blood also applied to Black Africans and indigenous peoples since, as Spaniards of Moorish and Jewish descent, they had not been Christian for various generations and were inherently suspect of engaging in religious heresy. In all Spanish territories, including Spain itself, evidence of lack of purity of blood had consequences for eligibility for office, entrance into the priesthood, and emigration to Spain&#x27;s overseas territories. Having to produce genealogical records to prove one&#x27;s pure ancestry gave rise to a trade in the creation of false genealogies, a practice which was already widespread in Spain itself.
This was no impediment for intermarriage between Spaniards and indigenous people, just as it had not been between Old and New Christians or different racial groups coexisting in late medieval and early modern Spain.
However, starting in the late 16th century, some investigations of ancestry classified as &quot;stains&quot; any connection with Black Africans (&quot;negros&quot;, which resulted in &quot;mulatos&quot;) and sometimes mixtures with indigenous that produced mestizos. While some illustrations from the period show men of African descent dressed in fashionable clothing and as aristocrats in upper-class surroundings, the idea that any hint of black ancestry was a stain developed by the end of the colonial period, a time in which biological racism began to emerge throughout the western world. This trend was illustrated in 18th-century paintings of racial hierarchy, known as casta paintings which led to 20th-century emergence of theories on a &quot;Caste System&quot; existing in Colonial Spanish America.
The idea in New Spain that native or &quot;Indian&quot; () blood in a lineage was an impurity may well have come about as the optimism of the early Franciscans faded about creating Indian priests trained at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, which ceased that function in the mid-16th century. In addition, the Indian nobility, which was recognized by the Spanish colonists, had declined in importance, and there were fewer formal marriages between Spaniards and indigenous women than during the early decades of the colonial era. In the 17th century in New Spain, the ideas of purity of blood became associated with &quot;Spanishness and whiteness, but it came to work together with socio-economic categories&quot;, such that a lineage with someone engaged in work with their hands was tainted by that connection.
Indians in Central Mexico were affected by ideas of purity of blood from the other side. Crown decrees on purity of blood were affirmed by indigenous communities, which barred Indians from holding office who had any non-Indians (Spaniards and/or Black peoples) in their lineage. In indigenous communities &quot;local caciques [rulers] and principales were granted a set of privileges and rights on the basis of their pre-Hispanic noble bloodlines and acceptance of the Catholic faith.&quot; Indigenous nobles submitted proofs () of their purity of blood to affirm their rights and privileges that were extended to themselves and their communities. This supported the , a legal division of society that separated indigenous from non-Indians ().
==Casta classifications and legal consequences==
 
In Spanish America racial categories were registered at local parishes upon baptism as required by the Spanish Crown. In Spanish America there were four ethnic categories. They generally referred to the multiplicity of indigenous American peoples as &quot;Indians&quot; (). Those from Spain called themselves . The third group were &quot;&quot; (mixed blood from Spaniards and Indians&quot;. The fourth group were black Africans, called (lit. &quot;blacks&quot;), brought as slaves from the earliest days of Spanish Empire.
Although the number of Spanish women emigrating to New Spain was far higher than is often portrayed, they were fewer in number than men, as well as fewer black women than men, so the mixed-race offspring of Spaniards and of Black people were often the product of liaisons with indigenous women. The process of race mixture is now termed , a term coined in the modern era.
In the 16th century, the term , a collective category for mixed-race individuals, came into existence as the numbers grew, particularly in urban areas.
The crown had divided the population of its overseas empire into two categories, separating Indians from non-Indians. Indigenous were the , the other the , essentially the Hispanic sphere, so that Spaniards, Black people, and mixed-race castas were lumped into this category. Official censuses and ecclesiastical records noted an individual&#x27;s racial category, so that these sources can be used to chart socio-economic standard, residence patterns, and other important data.
General racial groupings had their own set of privileges and restrictions, both legal and customary. So, for example, only Spaniards and indigenous people, who were deemed to be the original societies of the Spanish dominions, had recognized aristocracies. In the population at large, access to social privileges and even at times a person&#x27;s perceived and accepted racial classification, were predominantly determined by that person&#x27;s socioeconomic standing in society.
Official censuses and ecclesiastical records noted an individual&#x27;s racial category, so that these sources can be used to chart socio-economic standards, residence patterns, and other important data. Parish registers, where baptism, marriage, and burial were recorded, had three basic categories: español (Spaniards), , and (&quot;broken color&quot;, indicating a mixed-race person). In some parishes in colonial Mexico, were recorded with other non-Spaniards in the register. Españoles and mestizos could be ordained as priests and were exempt from payment of tribute to the crown. Free black people, indigenous people, and mixed-race castas were required to pay tribute and barred from the priesthood. Being designated as an español or mestizo conferred social and financial advantages. Black men began to apply to the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, but in 1688 Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza attempted to prevent their entrance by drafting new regulations barring black peoples and mulattoes. In 1776, the crown issued the Royal Pragmatic on Marriage, taking approval of marriages away from the couple and placing it in their parents&#x27; hands. The marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville and Miguel Rodríguez, a white Segovian conquistador in 1565 in St. Augustine (Spanish Florida), is the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in the continental United States.
Long lists of different terms found in casta paintings do not appear in official documentation or anywhere outside these paintings. Only counts of Spaniards, mestizos, black peoples and mulattoes, and indigenes (), were recorded in censuses.

==Casta paintings of the 18th century==


Artwork created mainly in 18th-century Mexico purports to show race mixture as a hierarchy. These paintings have had tremendous influence in how scholars have approached difference in the colonial era, but should not be taken as definitive description of racial difference. For approximately a century, casta paintings were by elite artists for an elite viewership. They ceased to be produced following Mexico&#x27;s independence in 1821 when casta designations were abolished. The vast majority of casta paintings were produced in Mexico, by a variety of artists, with a single group of canvases clearly identified for 18th-century Peru. In the colonial era, artists primarily created religious art and portraits, but in the 18th century, casta paintings emerged as a completely secular genre of art. An exception to that is the painting by Luis de Mena, a single canvas that has the central figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe and a set of casta groupings. Most sets of casta paintings have 16 separate canvases, but a few, such as Mena&#x27;s, Ignacio María Barreda, and the anonymous painting in the Museo de Virreinato in Tepozotlan, Mexico, are frequently reproduced as examples of the genre, likely because their composition gives a single, tidy image of the racial classification (from the elite viewpoint).
It is unclear why casta paintings emerged as a genre, why they became such a popular genre of artwork, who commissioned them, and who collected them. One scholar suggests they can be seen as &quot;proud renditions of the local,&quot; at a point when American-born Spaniards began forming a clearer identification with their place of birth rather than metropolitan Spain. The single-canvas casta artwork could well have been as a curiosity or souvenir for Spaniards to take home to Spain; two frequently reproduced casta paintings are Mena&#x27;s and Barreda&#x27;s, both of which are in Madrid museums. There is only one set of casta paintings definitively done in Peru, commissioned by Viceroy Manuel Amat y Junyent (1770), and sent to Spain for the Cabinet of Natural History of the Prince of Asturias.
The influence of the European Enlightenment on the Spanish empire led to an interest in organizing knowledge and scientific description might have resulted in the commission of many series of pictures that document the racial combinations that existed in Spanish territories in the Americas. Many sets of these paintings still exist (around one hundred complete sets in museums and private collections and many more individual paintings), of varying artistic quality, usually consisting of sixteen paintings representing as many racial combinations. It must be emphasized that these paintings reflected the views of the economically established Criollo society and officialdom, but not all Criollos were pleased with casta paintings. One remarked that they show &quot;what harms us, not what benefits us, what dishonors us, not what ennobles us.&quot; Many paintings are in Spain in major museums, but many remain in private collections in Mexico, perhaps commissioned and kept because they show the character of late colonial Mexico and a source of pride.
Some of the earliest identified paintings were painted by Juan Rodríguez Juárez under a commission from the viceroy of New Spain, Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares, who was interested in delineating racial categories. These are predated by four 1711 paintings by Manuel de Arellano of an unidentified mixed-race young woman and of Chichimeca indigenous men and women that may be considered precursors to the painting genre.

Some of the finer sets were done by prominent Mexican artists, such as José de Alcíbar, Miguel Cabrera, José de Ibarra, José Joaquín Magón, (who painted two sets); Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz, José de Páez, and Juan Rodríguez Juárez. One of Magón&#x27;s sets includes descriptions of the &quot;character and moral standing&quot; of his subjects. These artists worked together in the painting guilds of New Spain. They were important transitional artists in 18th-century casta painting. At least one Spaniard, Francisco Clapera, also contributed to the casta genre. In general, little is known of most artists who did sign their work; most casta paintings are unsigned.
Certain authors have interpreted the overall theme of these paintings as representing the &quot;supremacy of the Spaniards&quot;, the possibility that mixtures of Spaniards and Spanish-Indian offspring could return to the status of Spaniards through marriage to Spaniards over generations, what can be considered &quot;restoration of racial purity,&quot; or &quot;racial mending&quot; was seen visually in many sets of casta paintings. It was also articulated by a visitor to Mexico, Don Pedro Alonso O&#x27;Crouley, in 1774. &quot;If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a mestizo; a mestizo and a Spaniard, a castizo; and a castizo and a Spaniard, a Spaniard. The admixture of Indian blood should not indeed be regarded as a blemish, since the provisions of law give the Indian all that he could wish for, and Philip II granted to mestizos the privilege of becoming priests. On this consideration is based the common estimation of descent from a union of Indian and European or creole Spaniard.&quot;
O&#x27;Crouley says that the same process of restoration of racial purity does not occur over generations for European-African offspring marrying whites. “From the union of a Spaniard and a Negro the mixed-blood retains the stigma for generations without losing the original quality of a mulato.&quot; Casta paintings show increasing whitening over generations with the mixes of Spaniards and Africans. The sequence is the offspring of a Spaniard + &quot;Negra&quot;, Mulatto; Spaniard with a Mulatta, Morisco; Spaniard with a Morisca, &quot;Albino&quot; (a racial category, derived from &quot;Alba&quot;, &quot;white&quot;); Spaniard with an &quot;Albina&quot;, &quot;Torna atrás&quot;, or &quot;throw back&quot; black. &quot;Negro&quot;, &quot;Mulatto&quot;, and &quot;Morisco&quot; were labels found in colonial-era documentation, but &quot;Albino&quot; and &quot;Torna atrás&quot; exist only as fairly standard categories in casta paintings.
In contrast, mixtures with Black people, both by Indians and Spaniards, led to a bewildering number of combinations, with &quot;fanciful terms&quot; to describe them. Instead of leading to a new racial type or equilibrium, they led to apparent disorder. Terms such as the above-mentioned &quot;tente en el aire&quot; (&quot;floating in midair&quot;) and &quot;no te entiendo&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t understand you&quot;)—and others based on terms used for animals: &quot;coyote&quot; and &quot;lobo&quot; (wolf).
 defined themselves in different ways, and how they were recorded in official records was a process of negotiation between the and the person creating the document, whether it was a birth certificate, a marriage certificate or a court deposition. In real life, many individuals were assigned different racial categories in different documents, revealing the malleable nature of racial identity in colonial, Spanish American society.
Some paintings depicted the supposed &quot;innate&quot; character and quality of people because of their birth and ethnic origin. For example, according to one painting by José Joaquín Magón, a mestizo (mixed Indian + Spanish) was considered &quot;generally humble, tranquil, and straightforward&quot;; while another painting claims &quot;from Lobo and Indian woman is born the Cambujo, one usually slow, lazy, and cumbersome.&quot; Ultimately, the casta paintings are reminders of the colonial biases in modern human history that linked a caste/ethnic society based on descent, skin color, social status, and one&#x27;s birth.
Often, casta paintings depicted commodity items from Latin America like pulque, the fermented alcohol drink of the lower classes. Painters depicted interpretations of pulque that were attributed to specific castas.
The in casta paintings depict them as partners to Spaniards, Black people, and castas, and thus part of Hispanic society. But in a number of casta paintings, they are also shown apart from &quot;civilized society,&quot; such as Miguel Cabrera&#x27;s , or or &quot;Chichimecas&quot; barely clothed indigenous in a wild, setting. In the single-canvas casta painting by José María Barreda, there are a canonical 16 casta groupings and then in a separate cell below are &quot;Mecos&quot;. Although the so-called &quot;barbarian Indians&quot; () were fierce warriors on horseback, indios in casta paintings are not shown as bellicose, but as weak, a trope that developed in the colonial era. A casta painting by Luis de Mena that is often reproduced as an example of the genre shows an unusual couple with a pale, well-dressed Spanish woman paired with a nearly naked indio, producing a Mestizo offspring. &quot;The aberrant combination not only mocks social protocol but also seems to underscore the very artificiality of a casta system that pretends to circumscribe social fluidity and economic mobility.&quot; The image &quot;would have seemed frankly bizarre and offensive by eighteenth-century Creole elites, if taken literally&quot;, but if the pair were considered allegorical figures, the Spanish woman represents &quot;Europe&quot; and the indio &quot;America.&quot; The image &quot;functions as an allegory for the &#x27;civilizing&#x27; and Christianizing process.&quot;
===Sample sets of casta paintings===
Presented here are casta lists from three sets of paintings. Note that they only agree on the first five combinations, which are essentially the Indian-White ones. There is no agreement on the Black mixtures, however. Also, no one list should be taken as &quot;authoritative&quot;. These terms would have varied from region to region and across time periods. The lists here probably reflect the names that the artist knew or preferred, the ones the patron requested to be painted, or a combination of both.

<text>The Taieri Plain (also referred to in the plural as the Taieri Plains) is an area of fertile agricultural land to the southwest of Dunedin, in Otago, New Zealand. The plain covers an area of some 300 square kilometres, with a maximum extent of 30 kilometres. It is not to be confused with Strath Taieri, a second plain of the Taieri River, 40kms to the north beyond Mount Ross.

The floodplain of the Taieri and Waipori Rivers, the plain is enclosed to the west by Maungatua and the Silverpeaks Range, and to the south and east by a low range of coastal hills.

Dairy and sheep farming dominate the agriculture of the plain, although deer farming is starting to have an economic impact. The alluvial nature of the land means that floods are not uncommon, especially in the area around the confluence of the two rivers. Stopbanks protect farmland, houses and Dunedin International Airport at Momona. State Highway 1 crosses parts of the plain along some of the stopbanks, with the result that this stretch of road is known locally as &quot;The &quot;Floodfree&quot; Highway&quot;.

New Zealand&#x27;s lowest point, at 2m below sea level, is slightly north of the airport on Kirk&#x27;s Drain Road, Momona.

To the northeast, the city of Dunedin is separated from the Taieri Plain by a range of rugged hills which are part of the crater of an extinct volcano. At the northeastern limit of the plain lies the town of Mosgiel, officially part of the city of Dunedin. Other settlements and towns on the plain include Outram, Henley, Allanton, and Momona.

To the southwest, a short stretch of rolling hill country separates the Taieri Plain from South Otago&#x27;s other main lowland areas around the Tokomairaro River and Clutha River. The twin lakes of Waihola and Waipori sit within these hills, as does the Sinclair Wetlands Reserve.

<text>The Conimbricenses are an important collection of Jesuit commentaries on Aristotle compiled at University of Coimbra in Coimbra, Portugal.

==Commentaries==
The Coimbra Commentaries, also known as the Conimbricenses or Cursus Conimbricenses, are a group of 11 books on Aristotle (only eight can be called commentaries). They were produced as part of King John III of Portugal&#x27;s efforts to make the University of Coimbra rival the University of Paris. The names of 200 Jesuits, including those of professors and students, appeared repeatedly on the college registries. From the late 16th to the early 17th centuries, the university produced voluminous commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s philosophical writings. The commentaries were, in fact, dictated to the students by the professors and so were not intended for publication. After they were published anyway, to interpret and disown incorrect and unauthorized editions, Claudio Acquaviva, the General of the Society of Jesus, assigned Pedro da Fonseca, the provincial of the Portuguese province, the task of supervising the revision of the commentaries for authorized publication. Fonseca was called &quot;the Aristotle of Portugal&quot; by Charles George Herbermann in his &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia.&quot;

===Contents===
The treatises appeared in the following order:

# &quot;Commentarii, Collegii, Conimbricenses, Societatis, Jesu in octo, libros Physicorum, Aristotelis, Stagyritæ,&quot; (Coimbra, 1591, reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 1984);
# &quot;Commentarii, Collegii, Conimbricenses, Societatis, Jesu in quattuor, libros, Physicorum, Aristotelis de Cœlo&quot; (Coimbra, 1592);
# &quot;Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in libros Meteororum Aristotelis Stagyritæ&quot; (Coimbra, 1592);
# &quot;Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in libros Aristotelis qui Parva naturalia appelantur&quot; (Coimbra, 1592);
# &quot;Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in libros Ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nichomachum aliquot Cursus Conimbricensis disputationes in quibus præcipua quaedam Ethicæ disciplinæ capita continentur&quot; (Coimbra, 1595);
# &quot;Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in duos libros Aristotelis De generatione et corruptione&quot; (Coimbra, 1595, reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 2003);
# &quot;Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in tres libros Aristotelis De Anima&quot; (Coimbra, 1592 reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 2006). This treatise was published after the death of Father Manuel de Góis (whom Father Fonseca had commissioned to publish the earlier volumes) by Father Comas Maggalliano (Magalhães). He added a treatise of Father Balthazaar Alvarez &quot;De Anima Separata&quot; and his own work &quot;Tractatio aliquot problematum ad quinque Sensus Spectantium&quot;;
# &quot;Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu In universam dialecticam nunc primum&quot; (ed. Venice, 1606, reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 1976) The works commented are In Isagogem Porphyry, In libros Categoriarium Aristotelis, In libros Aristotelis de Interpretatione, In libros Aristotelis Stagiritae de Priori Resolutione, In primum librum Posteriorum Aristotelis, In librum primum Topicorum Aristotelis and In duos libros Elenchorum Aristotelis.

A foreword prefixed the last treatise and disowned any connection with the work published at Frankfurt in 1604 and claiming to be the &quot;Commentarii Conimbricenses&quot;. It reads in part, &quot;Before we could finish the task entrusted to us of editing our Logic, to which we were bound by many promises, certain German publishers fraudulently brought out a work professing to be from us, abounding in errors and inaccuracies which were really their own. They also substituted for our commentaries certain glosses gotten furtively. It is true these writings thirty years previously were the work of one of our professors not indeed intended for publication. They were the fruit of his zeal and he never dreamed they would appear in print&quot;.

The last treatise was prepared for printing by Father Sebastian Couto. The eight parts formed five quarto volumes in wide circulation and appeared in many editions. The best known were those of Lyon, Lisbon and Cologne. The Commentaries are in Latin and are supplemented by reliable explanations of the text and an exhaustive discussion of the Aristotelian system.

In the Introduction to his translation work, John Doyle writes that three methods were utilized in the Conimbricenses. The first, summary, reflects the work of Avicenna. The second method, explanation, reflects the work of Averroes. The third method, exposition by way of question, reflects the work of Duns Scotus. The Conimbricenses relied heavily on exposition by way of question while still employing summary and explanation.

==Influence==
According the John Deely, Poinsot and Peirce owe their attention to &quot;Thirdness&quot; to the influence of the Conimbricenses.

In the Introduction to the English translation of &quot;The Conimbricenses. Some Questions on Signs&quot;, Doyle writes that 
These commentaries had broad influence throughout the seventeenth century in Europe, North and South America, Africa, India, and the Far East, including both Japan and China.
Doyle goes on to write that Descartes, Leibniz, and possibly Spinoza were influenced by the Conimbricenses.

<text>Skookum is a Chinook Jargon word that has been in widespread historical use in British Columbia and the Yukon, as well as the Pacific Northwest. It has a range of meanings, commonly associated with an English translation of &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;monstrous&quot;. The word can mean strong, greatest, powerful, ultimate, or brave. Something can be &quot;skookum&quot;, meaning &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;monstrously significant&quot;. When used in reference to another person, e.g. &quot;he&#x27;s skookum&quot;, it conveys connotations of reliability or a monstrous nature, as well as strength, size or a hard-working nature. DCHP-3 classifies skookum as a Type 4 Canadianism, by virtue of cultural significance.

==Derivative words==
&quot;Skookum house&quot; means &#x27;jail&#x27; or &#x27;prison&#x27; (cf. the English euphemism &quot;the big house&quot;, but here meaning &#x27;strong house&#x27;). &quot;Skookum tumtum&quot;, lit. &quot;strong heart&quot;, is generally translated as &#x27;brave&#x27; or possibly &#x27;good-hearted&#x27;. In the Chinook language, &quot;skookum&quot; is a verb auxiliary, used similarly to &quot;can&quot; or &quot;to be able&quot;. Another compound, though fallen out of use in modern British Columbia English, is &quot;skookum lacasset&quot; or &#x27;strongbox&#x27;.

&quot;Skookumchuck&quot; means &#x27;turbulent water&#x27; or &#x27;rapids in a stream or river&#x27;, literally &#x27;strong water&#x27; (&quot;chuck&quot; is Chinook Jargon for &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;stream&#x27; or &#x27;lake&#x27;). It is a common placename in British Columbia, Washington and Idaho. The term is used for tidal-exchange rapids at the mouths of inlets and bays, a regular feature of the Inside Passage, especially Skookumchuck Narrows.

==Monsters==
A &quot;skookum&quot; is a variety of mountain giant or monster similar to the Sasquatch or Bigfoot. In the surviving Chinuk-Wawa spoken in Grand Ronde, Oregon, this variant is pronounced differently—&quot;skoo-KOOM&quot;—but when used in English with this meaning, it is pronounced the same way as the &quot;big and strong&quot; meaning.

Skookums were bad spirits or devils of which crows, eagles, owls, blue jays, various beasts and reptiles could be representations. They could inhabit people and cause serious illness.

==Dolls== 
A derivative usage of the skookum-as-monster context was the application of the name to a souvenir Skookum doll, sometimes simply called &quot;a skookum&quot;. Mary McAboy first started making Skookum dolls in 1913 and received a patent for them in 1914. They were popular from the early 1920s until the 1960s. They were factory-made dolls that resembled Native American people and were sold to tourists at trading posts in the western United States.

Early dolls heads were made of dried apples with the bodies made of wood and stuffed with either leaves, straw, twigs or grass stuffed in a muslin sack. Later the dolls were composition dolls and had mohair wigs. Later dolls were made of plastic and had plastic brown shoes. They have &quot;Indian style&quot; blankets as part of their attire. Some had jewelry such as beaded necklaces or earrings. Some dolls have feathered headdresses. The sizes of the dolls ranged from babies inside of cradle boards to large, human size store display dolls. The rule of thumb is the larger the doll, the more valuable/rare they are. The most common sizes range from about seven inches to about 12 inches tall. Skookums were widely imitated. Minnetonka, Milbros or Minnehaha dolls are similar, but not the same. Most Skookum dolls were made so they look to the right. Skookums do not have arms: they are wrapped with blankets and have the suggestion of arms. Skookums never have gray hair, as in &quot;elders&quot;. Skookums should have the words &quot;Skookum&quot; either stamped on their brown plastic shoes or a tag with &quot;Skookum&quot; on their foot in the case of the older versions.

==Other uses==
Skookum, either alone or in the combination skookumchuck, occurs in dozens of placenames throughout the Pacific Northwest region and beyond. A short form used with personal names, &quot;Skook&quot;, is found on the map of British Columbia at Mount Skook Davidson near the confluence of the Kechika and Gataga Rivers in northern British Columbia and Mount Skook Jim, near the head of the Stein River in the northern Lillooet Ranges between Pemberton and Lytton. Local lore in any area of British Columbia may have a Skookum Charlie or a Skookum Brown; the most famous of such nicknames was that of Skookum Jim, one of the co-discoverers of the Klondike goldfields in the Yukon. It is also the name given to a famous 1909 Baldwin 2-4-4-2 Mallet type logging locomotive. That locomotive, Columbia River Belt Line Number 7, is notable both for being the first Mallet built by the company for logging purposes, and for having been saved from its planned scrapping by getting into an accident that caused it to be stranded in the woods until preservationists could purchase and restore it.

<text>Skookumchuck is in the East Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia. This locality straddles both shores of the Kootenay River north of the mouth of the Lussier River. The crossing, on the merged section of highways 93 and 95, is by road about north of Cranbrook and southeast of Golden.

==Name origin==
The name derives from Skookumchuck Creek, which an 1880s account describes the idea as &quot;stream of the rapid torrent&quot;. Gold prospectors built cabins on the creek, which is about west of the present Skookumchuck bridge across the Kootenay River. Prior to erecting this link in the 1920s, the community on the east end was called Springbrook and the general area on the west side was called Skookumchuck. Subsequently, the merged communities adopted the more dominant Skookumchuck identity.

==Transportation==
Since the 1890s, the basic elements have been similar to Wasa road and river and Wasa rail.

==Community==
Although mining and logging had attracted settlers, the commencement of rail service in 1915 prompted further growth. John W. Blake was the inaugural postmaster 1915–1921. By 1918, he ran a general store near the station, but the few surrounding houses were soon deserted after the occupants moved farther north or west.

Around 1940, the Springbrook log cabins and a log grocery store were erected.
A two-storey motel was added in the mid-1960s, and the log store burned to the ground in the mid-1970s. The rebuild was across the highway. In 1967, the telephone exchange opened.

In 1968, the establishment of the Skookumchuck Pulp Mill near the creek brought new subdivisions at Skookumchuck and new residents to the general area. Mill upgrades totalled $17 million in 1975, $22 million in 1985, and $279 million in 1993. A $50 million woodwaste cogeneration plant opened in 2001. In 2013, Paper Excellence Canada Holdings bought the mill from Tembecs for $89 million. In 2021, the mill was fined over $100,000 for exceeding permitted limits in treated wastewater discharges and air emissions.

The community infrastructure includes a convenience store/gas bar, and a motel/RV park/campground.

==Education==
Historically, Skookumchuck covered a general area radiating about from the train station. Larchwood school was regarded as being in Skookumchuck. However, the school&#x27;s specific positioning was about east of Larchwood Lake. In 1921, classes began for mill workers&#x27; children. Over the years, a series of schoolhouses and residences housed the students. By 1938, the school was farther south near the Skookumchuck train station. Enrolments included children from Torrent. The final school year was 1943/44.

In 1906, Sam Cadieux settled on Sheep Creek (Lussier River) about north of Premier Lake ( northeast of present Skookumchuck). The location was a stage stopping place. The school, which existed 1932–1952, was immediately northwest of Premier Lake. In 1949, a new building was erected. During this era, a school bus ran from Springbrook. In 1952, the new portable building of Springbrook Elementary, replaced the log-cabin school at remote Sheep Creek. Springbrook closed in 1957.

<text>Pepin or Pippin (born Carloman), (777 – 8 July 810) was King of Italy from 781 until his death in 810. He was the third son of Charlemagne (and his second with Queen Hildegard). Upon his baptism in 781, Carloman was renamed Pepin, where he was also crowned as king of the Lombard Kingdom his father had conquered. Pepin ruled the kingdom from a young age under Charlemagne, but predeceased his father. His son Bernard was named king of Italy after him, and his descendants were the longest-surviving direct male line of the Carolingian dynasty.

==Life==
Carloman born in 777, the second son of Charlemagne and his wife Hildegard. Carloman had an older brother, Charles the Younger, and half brother Pepin the Hunchback, Charlemagne&#x27;s eldest son. Charlemagne had been king of the Franks since 768, and in 774 conquered the Kingdom of the Lombards in northern Italy, partially on the request of Pope Adrian I for assistance against the Lombard king Desiderius. In 781, Charlemagne and Hildegard brought Carloman along with his younger brother Louis the Pious and sisters Rotrude and Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne to Rome at Adrian&#x27;s request. Carloman was four years old, but his 
parents had delayed his baptism so that the Pope could perform it. Carloman was baptized, and Adrian then crowned him as king of the Lombards (later styled king of Italy) and his brother Louis as king of Aquitaine. As part of Carloman&#x27;s baptism, he was renamed Pepin, now sharing a name with his half-brother. The reason behind the name change is obscure, but it was likely chosen to evoke the memory of his grandfather Pepin the Short, remembered as a staunch ally of the papacy, and this legacy was important to emphasize for the young king who was to rule Italy. 

Though only four years old, Pepin&#x27;s coronation was not nominal—he was brought to Lombardy to live under the care of advisors provided by Charlemagne,the most important of which were Adalard of Corbie, Waldo of Reichenau, the Lombard duke Rotchild, and Angilbert. Pepin&#x27;s court was based primarily at Verona, though he also operated from palaces in Mantua and the traditional Lombard capital of Pavia. Pepin was king in his own name, but Charlemagne took a strong hand in Italy even into Pepin&#x27;s adulthood, even on occasion issuing laws directly.

After Pepin came of age, he began fulfilling his role as a military leader. He participated in his father&#x27;s campaign against Tassilo III of Bavaria in 786. In 796, he led a campaign against the Avar Khaganate, taking their stronghold and precipitating the collapse of the Avar state, allowing the Frankish realm to expand eastward. Pepin&#x27;s victory was celebrated in the contemporary Latin poem . Pepin also led multiple raids against the Duchy of Benevento and a successful campaign in 810 against the Republic of Venice.

In 806, Charlemagne gathered his sons and issued the , which outlined formalized plans for the inheritance of the empire upon his death. Pepin was confirmed in this rule of Italy while also gaining most of Bavaria and Alamannia; Louis gained Provence, Septimania, and most of Burgundy in addition to Aquitaine; and Charles as his eldest son in good favour (Pepin the Hunchback having been confined to a monastery after a failed rebellion), was given the largest share of the inheritance, with rule of Francia proper along with Saxony, Nordgau, and parts of Alemannia. Charlemagne did not address the inheritance of the title of emperor he had gained in 800. The also addressed the death of any of the brothers, and urged peace between them and between any of their nephews who might inherit.

Charlemagne&#x27;s succession plans did not come to fruition. Pepin died on 8 July 810, followed in quick succession by the deaths of his sister Rotrude, his aunt Gisela, Abbess of Chelles, and his half brother Pepin, and his brother Charles over the course of 810–811. All were possibly victims of an epidemic that had spread from cattle in 810. In the wake of these deaths, Charlemagne declared Pepin&#x27;s son Bernard ruler of Italy, and his own only surviving son Louis as heir to the rest of the empire. Louis and Bernard were formally invested as Charlemagne&#x27;s heirs in September of 813, and would fully succeed upon his death in 814.

==Family and descendants==
Pepin was married to Theodrada, who was his father&#x27;s cousin and sister to his advisor Adalard. His brother Louis would use the close relation between Pepin and his wife to portray the marriage as illegitimate in order to sideline Bernard. Bernard&#x27;s male-line descendants continued to rule as counts of Vermandois in Italy into the eleventh century, longer than any other agnatic descendants of Charlemagne. In addition to Bernard, Pepin had five daughters: Adalhaid (the wife of Lambert I of Nantes and mother of Guy I of Spoleto), Arula, Gundrada, Berthaid, and Theodrada. After Pepin&#x27;s death, Charlemagne took the girls into his own household. Pepin was also an ancestor of Hugh Capet, the first King of France from the House of Capet.

<text>The Powell River is a 195-mile-long river in the United States that rises in Southwest Virginia and flows southwest into East Tennessee.

The South Fork of the river rises in rural Wise County, Virginia, near the Laurel Grove community northwest of Norton and flows for several miles before the confluence with Roaring Fork in the Kent Junction community. From Kent Junction the river flows until it meets the North Fork of the river near Woodway, Virginia. The North Folk originates near Keokee, Virginia. The river flows past Big Stone Gap, Virginia, and then runs nearly the entire length of Lee County, Virginia. It drains approximately 954 square miles (2,471 km2) in both Virginia and Tennessee before reaching its confluence with the Clinch River in the Norris Lake reservoir at the site of the town of Grantsboro, Tennessee.

The Powell River was named for Ambrose Powell who accompanied the exploration party of Dr. Thomas Walker in the mid-18th century. Legend has it that his name appeared so frequently carved on trees in the valley of this river that later explorers and early pioneers came to call the stream &quot;Powell&#x27;s River&quot; and the valley &quot;Powell&#x27;s Valley&quot;.

The Powell River was designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the &quot;second most biologically diverse aquatic system in the nation.&quot; The Powell is under pressure from the effects of mining (including strip mining), logging and associated road-building.

Lincoln Memorial University operates the Powell River Aquatic Research Station, which is located where Tennessee State Route 63 crosses the river at the Brooks Bridge in Claiborne County, Tennessee. The center allows for on-site research of water quality, flora, fauna and related habitat.

Fishing in the Powell River can be great in some areas; in Wise County the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources stocks trout in the shallow rushing waters of the Middle Fork under a &quot;delayed harvest&quot; designation. Downstream from Lee County, the river is home to smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, red eye bass, bluegill, carp, red horses, walleye, sauger and even musky. A lot of people kayak the river and even wade to fish.

In July 2024, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources (DWR) celebrated improved stream access to the Powell River in Jonesville, Virginia. After completing the projects, kayakers and anglers could easily get to the water in three areas along the Powell River that had been inaccessible by public land areas.

<text>Powell River is a city on the northern Sunshine Coast of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Most of its population lives near the eastern shores of Malaspina Strait, which is part of the larger Georgia Strait between Vancouver Island and the Mainland. With two intervening long, steep-sided fjords inhibiting the construction of a contiguous road connection with Vancouver to the south, geographical surroundings explain Powell River&#x27;s remoteness as a community, despite relative proximity to Vancouver and other populous areas of the BC Coast. The city is the location of the head office of the qathet Regional District.

==History==
The Powell River was named for Israel Wood Powell. Powell was B.C.&#x27;s first superintendent for Indian Affairs and a chief architect of colonial policies, including the establishment of residential schools in British Columbia and the banning of the Potlatch. He was traveling up the coast of BC in 1881 and the river and lake were named after him.

Powell was a supporter of B.C. being part of the union with Canada and brought the first Canadian flag to BC on June 17, 1871.

The pulp mill was started in 1908, with a corresponding townsite company town commenced in 1910: the first roll of paper was produced at Powell River Mill in 1912. Similarly, large logging companies had earlier moved in to take advantage of the huge timber. Brooks, Scanlon &amp; Obrien; Bloedel, Stewart and Welch; and Theodosia Logging were but a few logging companies, with the Brooks brothers and M.J. Scanlon forming the Powell River Company, western Canada&#x27;s first pulp and paper mill. The Historic Townsite was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995, recognizing the exceptionally well preserved early 20th Century planned community, rooted firmly in the Garden City Design Movement and the Arts and Crafts philosophy.

When the British Columbia Credit Unions Act was passed in 1939, a study club organized by local millworkers secured the first charter with a deposit of $48.30. The mill provided a small office space at very low rent in the early years. By 1955, when the Powell River Credit Union (now &#x27;First Credit Union&#x27;) moved into a permanent office, it had over 3,000 members and $1 million in assets.

In March 1944, the Malahat began taking on water while being towed in the Barkley Sound. She was then moved to Powell River where she was made part of the breakwater.

The mill in Powell River was at one time the largest pulp and paper mill in the world. In its prime, one in every 25 newspapers in the world was printed on paper from the Powell River mill. However, since then it has significantly cut back on production and now produces newsprint and specialty papers for Catalyst Paper. In 2019, Paper Excellence Group acquired Catalyst Paper. In 2023, the mill was permanently curtailed.

The subsequent diversification of the local economy led to an increased focus on ecotourism and the arts, in addition to more traditional resources like mining, fishing, and general forestry. In recognition of its strong arts and cultural programs, Powell River was named a &quot;Cultural Capital of Canada&quot; in 2004.

The Powell River area is the current home to the Tla&#x27;amin Nation of the Mainland Comox branch of the Coast Salish peoples, who still reside there to this day. Their village is commonly referred to as Sliammon (the usual English adaptation of Tla&#x27;amin).

== Name change ==

In May 2021, Tla&#x27;amin Nation submitted a request to Powell River city council to change the name of the city. The request comes because city namesake Israel Powell, B.C.’s superintendent of Indian affairs from 1872 to 1889, helped to ensure that the sale of Lot 450, land that included tiyskʷat village, went through, as well as overseeing the removal of children from their homes to be sent to residential schools, and the banning of potlatch, language and other Indigenous customs.

==Sports teams==
Powell River is host to the Powell River Kings, a member team of the British Columbia Hockey League, and the Powell River Regals, a Senior Men&#x27;s hockey team, founded in 1955 and winner of 3 national and several provincial championships. The Powell River Villa play in the Vancouver Island Soccer League. Powell River also has many youth sports teams and associations.

PRMHA is the minor hockey associations with house &amp; rep teams. Powell River&#x27;s youth baseball league is called the PRMBA. It consists of divisions for are groups 5 and 18. Powell River&#x27;s gymnastics association has produced many reputable gymnasts.

== Attractions ==
In 2020, Powell River received a $10,000 grant from the government of British Columbia to support tourism in the town. Nearby, Texada Island with quiet beaches and lakes provides tourism opportunities and is a common weekend destination for the cities&#x27; residents. Both Texada Island and Powell River are popular for fishing, hunting, sailing, power boating camping and remote hiking.

The Spanish renaissance-style Patricia Theatre is Canada&#x27;s oldest continuously operating theatre, first built in 1913 and then rebuilt in 1928. The qathet Museum and Archives depicts the interactions between the pioneers and First Nations as well as showing the tools and items that would have been used by those groups. The Townsite Heritage Society was formed in 1992 to maintain and promote the historical character of the traditional neighbourhood and business section of the Powell River Townsite.

Powell River hosts a number of festivals that highlight local interest and culture, including the Blackberry Festival, Pacific Region International Summer Music Academy (PRISMA) Festival, Logger Sports, Townsite Jazz Festival, International Choral Kathaumixw, and the Sunshine Music Festival.

The Cty of Powell River and surrounding area are home to over 300 Km’s of cycling trails. Volunteer built and maintained, the two largest areas for cycling are Duck Lake (XC riding) and Mount Mahony (Enduro riding). In 2023 after many years of work by the qathet Regional Cycling Association, the province of BC granted authority to the club to establish a new parking lot and professionally built climb and descent trails that continue to expand. 

Powell River is home to the Sunshine Coast Trail, Canada&#x27;s longest hut-to-hut hiking trail. The free-access 180 kilometre back-country trail meanders through a wide variety of landscapes, including coastal shorelines, old-growth forest, panoramic mountaintops, pristine creeks and lakes and salmon streams.

==Transportation==

While located on the mainland and not an island by definition, Powell River is a community isolated by ocean and mountains and is only accessible by water (BC Ferries) or by air (Powell River Airport). Powell River is located on Highway 101 but driving the length of the highway requires two ferries before arriving at Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver. The alternative access to the town is a ferry crossing from Comox on Vancouver Island. Since the Sunshine Coast is similarly isolated from the rest of the BC mainland, vehicles from Vancouver must take two ferries to reach Powell River (across Howe Sound and the Jervis Inlet, if travelling via Sechelt; and across Georgia Strait twice if going via Nanaimo). The surrounding inlets (fjords) banked by mountainous terrain have made land based road connections to other areas of the BC mainland an expensive proposal. One land based route connecting Powell River to Highway 99 near Squamish has been studied, but would require two tunnels (4.5 km and 8.0 km long) and cost around 5 billion dollars. All of the city&#x27;s roads are two-lane residential roads, and Highway 101 merges with Marine Avenue to form the city&#x27;s main street.

Powell River has two ferry terminals, both of which belong to BC Ferries. The Westview Ferry Terminal is located near the city&#x27;s downtown and provides service to Comox and Vancouver Island on board the &quot;Salish Eagle,&quot; and to Texada Island on the &quot;Island Discovery.&quot; The Saltery Bay Ferry Terminal is located 23 km south on Highway 101 and provides access to the Sunshine Coast on the &quot;Malaspina Sky&quot; via route to Earl&#x27;s Cove near Skookumchuck Narrows.

Powell River has a small airport with a single 1,200 meter long runway and indoor waiting terminal. It is serviced by Pacific Coastal Airlines, which offers 20- to 25-minute flights between Powell River Airport and the South Terminal of Vancouver&#x27;s International Airport. Charter flights and private aircraft also make use the runway on a regular basis.

The City of Powell River also has a small network of public transportation bus routes, run by BC Transit with 6 routes.

==City of Powell River==
The City of Powell River includes the original Townsite, which became designated a National Historic District in 1995, one of only seven in Canada.

<text>Strange Adventures is a series of American comic books published by DC Comics, the first of which was August–September 1950, according to the cover date, and published continuously until November 1973.

==Original series==
&quot;Strange Adventures&quot; ran for 244 issues and was DC Comics&#x27; first science fiction title. It began with an adaptation of the film &quot;Destination Moon&quot;. The sales success of the gorilla cover-featured story in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #8 (May 1951) led DC to produce numerous comic book covers with depictions of gorillas. The series was home to one of the last superheroes of the pre-Silver Age of Comic Books era, Captain Comet, created by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino in issue #9. A combination of the &quot;Captain Comet&quot; feature with the &quot;gorilla craze&quot; was presented in issue #39 (December 1953). Other notable series included Star Hawkins which began in issue #114 (March 1960) and the Atomic Knights which debuted in issue #117 (June 1960).

In &quot;The Strange Adventure That Really Happened&quot; in issue #140 (May 1962), real life comics creators editor Julius Schwartz and artist Sid Greene struggle to make writer Gardner Fox recall a story he has written that holds the key to saving the Earth from alien invasion. In a rare acknowledgement of the rest of the DC universe in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot;, one panel mentions Gardner Fox having previously met the Flash in the iconic Silver Age story &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot;.

&quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #180 (September 1965) introduced Animal Man in a story by Dave Wood and Carmine Infantino. The character was revived by writer Grant Morrison in 1988. Writer Bob Haney and artist Howard Purcell created the supernatural character the Enchantress in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #187 (April 1966). The Enchantress appears in the 2016 live-action movie &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, portrayed by Cara Delevingne.

Initially a science fiction anthology title with some continuing features starring SF protagonists, the series became a supernatural-fantasy title beginning with issue #202, for which it received a new logo. Deadman&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #205, written by Arnold Drake and drawn by Carmine Infantino, included the first known depiction of narcotics in a story approved by the Comics Code Authority. The &quot;Deadman&quot; feature served as an early showcase for the artwork of Neal Adams.

With issue #217, the title gained another new logo and began reprinting stories of Adam Strange and the Atomic Knights, among other stories. Several &quot;Strange Adventure&quot; stories were also reprinted in some of DC Comics&#x27; later anthologies such as &quot;From Beyond the Unknown&quot;.

In 1978, DC Comics intended to revive &quot;Strange Adventures&quot;. These plans were put on hold that year due to the DC Implosion, a line-wide scaling back of the company&#x27;s publishing output. When the project was revived a year later, the title was changed to &quot;Time Warp&quot; and the series was in the Dollar Comics format.

<text>David Richard Cunliffe (born 30 April 1963) is a New Zealand management consultant and former politician who was Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition from September 2013 to September 2014. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Titirangi and then New Lynn for the Labour Party between 1999 and 2017. He served as the Minister of Health, Minister for Communications and Information Technology and Minister of Immigration for the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand from October 2007 until November 2008.

After the defeat of the Labour Party in the 2008 general election, and the resignation of Helen Clark as the party leader, Cunliffe was appointed the party&#x27;s finance spokesman and number three on the front bench. After Labour lost the 2011 general election and Phil Goff stood down as party leader, Cunliffe ran for the leadership, but narrowly lost to David Shearer.

On 26 August 2013, Cunliffe announced a second leadership bid after David Shearer&#x27;s departure from the leadership and was elected on 15 September 2013. Following Labour&#x27;s defeat at the general election in September 2014, he resigned as leader of the Labour Party.

==Early life==
Cunliffe was born in Te Aroha on 30 April 1963. His family moved to Te Kūiti, then to Pleasant Point. His father, Bill, an Anglican minister, was active in the Labour Party. As a teenager he won a scholarship to study the International Baccalaureate at the United World College of the Atlantic in Wales. Cunliffe studied politics at the University of Otago, where he was a member of the Otago University Debating Society, and gained a BA with first-class honours. He worked as a diplomat from 1987 to 1994 and gained a Diploma in Social Sciences (Distinction) in economics from Massey University in 1993. He was a Fulbright Scholar and Kennedy Memorial Fellow at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, including some courses at Harvard Business and Law School in 1994 and 1995, earning a Master of Public Administration. He worked as a management consultant with The Boston Consulting Group in Auckland from 1995 to 1999.

==Member of Parliament==


Cunliffe was first elected to Parliament in the 1999 election, standing as the Labour candidate for the Titirangi seat. Labour formed a new Government and Cunliffe served as Chair of the Commerce Select Committee and sat on the Finance and Expenditure and Regulations Review select committees.

Due to boundary changes for the 2002 election Cunliffe contested the seat of New Lynn, which he won. Cunliffe&#x27;s party continued in Government for its second term and he was made a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Ministers of Commerce, Finance and Revenue before being elevated to the Executive Council as a Minister outside of Cabinet in 2003. At the 2005 election, Cunliffe was returned in New Lynn with 18,087 votes (8,000 more than his nearest opponent) or 55% of the electorate vote, and also promoted into Cabinet.

Cunliffe retained his seat in the , , and s, during which the Labour Party was in Opposition. He served various senior roles, including as Finance Spokesperson, but was regarded as &quot;a destabilising force&quot; undermining the leadership of Labour Party leaders Phil Goff and David Shearer. Cunliffe was eventually elected as Labour Party Leader and Leader of the Opposition for twelve months in 2013 and 2014, including at the 2014 general election where the party received its worst result in 100 years.

Cunliffe&#x27;s intention to retire from politics was announced by his successor, Andrew Little, on 1 November 2016. Cunliffe officially resigned from Parliament in April 2017, near enough to the 2017 election to avoid the need for a by-election.

===Cabinet minister (2005–2008)===
Cunliffe was appointed to the Cabinet of New Zealand in 2005 for the third term of the Fifth Labour Government, initially as the Minister of Immigration, Minister of Communications, Minister for Information Technology, and Associate Minister for Economic Development. He had previously held the Communications and Information Technology portfolios outside of Cabinet. A Cabinet reshuffle in 2007 saw him lose the Immigration portfolio in exchange for the more senior position as Minister of Health.

==== Immigration ====

As Immigration Minister in 2006, Cunliffe initiated a major review of the Immigration Act 1987 which, under the oversight of his successors, resulted in the eventual replacement of that Act with the new Immigration Act 2009.

==== Communications and Information Technology ====
Cunliffe served as an Associate Minister for Communications and Associate Minister for Information Technology from 2003 before being promoted to the primary portfolios in 2004. The two portfolios were merged into a single ministerial role in 2007.

As Minister for Communications and Information Technology he announced extensive pro-competitive reform of the telecommunications sector, including local loop unbundling and operational separation of then Telecom New Zealand.

In May 2006 Cunliffe was referred to the Securities Commission by the NZX for commenting on Telecom&#x27;s future dividend plans, causing Telecom&#x27;s stock price to drop. The Securities Commission found that no law had been breached and no action was taken.

On 30 June 2008 Cunliffe was conferred the title of &quot;Honorary Fellow of the NZCS&quot; (HFNZCS) by the New Zealand Computer Society, the professional body of the ICT profession in recognition of his significant contribution to the ICT sector.

====Health====
Cunliffe was promoted to the Health portfolio in 2007, replacing Pete Hodgson. He received some attention when, early in the portfolio, he said to his opposition counterpart Tony Ryall, &quot;Mr Ryall, why don&#x27;t you stay in your box. I&#x27;m running this show.&quot;

In February 2008, as the Minister of Health, Cunliffe dismissed the Hawke&#x27;s Bay District Health Board over political, monetary and conflict of interest troubles. Napier Mayor Barbara Arnott and a number of members of the district voiced opposition to Cunliffe&#x27;s move as many of the board members were democratically elected. Following the release of a Health Ministry-commissioned independent report into the matter, Cunliffe referred to the board as a &quot;nasty little nest of self-perpetuating provincial elites&quot;.

===In Opposition (2008–2013)===

After the 2008 general election defeat of the Labour Party, Cunliffe was made Labour&#x27;s spokesman for finance, shadowing National&#x27;s Finance Minister, Bill English. Cunliffe had been touted as a future leader of the party, and party insiders had suggested he seriously considered challenging Phil Goff as leader in the aftermath of the 2008 election. Speculation of a leadership challenge again arose during the June 2010 expenses scandal and again after Chris Carter&#x27;s resignation from the party.

After Labour lost the 2011 general election and Goff stood down, Cunliffe ran for the party leadership with Nanaia Mahuta on a ticket for deputy leader. Grant Robertson and David Parker also entered the race, but subsequently backed David Shearer, who won the high-profile race. Robertson became deputy leader, while Parker took Cunliffe&#x27;s finance spokesmanship. Shearer retained Cunliffe in a senior role on the front bench, with the economic development and associate finance roles.

In November 2012 during a Labour Party conference, there was much media speculation Cunliffe would launch a challenge against David Shearer for leadership of the party. On the morning of 19 November, Cunliffe confirmed he was not challenging Shearer, and would indeed back him if a vote was taken. However, Cunliffe was accused of demonstrating disloyalty and subsequently stripped of his front bench position and his portfolios.

====Labour Party leadership contest, 2013====
On 22 August 2013, Shearer announced his resignation as leader of the Labour Party. Cunliffe was expected to make another bid for the leadership but did not confirm his candidacy immediately. Victoria University of Wellington&#x27;s iPredict online predictions market showed the probability of Cunliffe becoming the next leader of the Labour Party at 66%, compared to under 26% support for Shearer&#x27;s deputy Grant Robertson; social development spokesperson Jacinda Ardern polled at 5%, and list MP Andrew Little was on 2%.

Cunliffe formally entered the 2013 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election during a press conference in his New Lynn electorate office His announcement came in the wake of a ONE News Colmar Brunton poll released by the current affair programme Q+A which showed Cunliffe winning the support of 29% of the eligible voters asked, and 32% of those polled who support Labour. Challengers Shane Jones and Grant Robertson were on 11% and 10%, respectively. After the first public Labour Party leadership selection process in New Zealand history, Cunliffe was elected leader on 15 September 2013. He won with the support of 32% of the Labour Party caucus, 60% of Labour Party members, and 70% of affiliated unions.

===Leader of the Opposition (2013–2014)===

Cunliffe received strong backing from the party&#x27;s grassroots membership, although his leadership bid was supported by only one-third of the caucus. Cunliffe&#x27;s leadership was opposed by many Labour MPs; several of his colleagues came to see him as &quot;divisive, ambitious, self-absorbed and self-confident to a messianic level&quot;. He was described as a &quot;polarising&quot; politician, however his election as leader resulting in an initial increase in support for Labour; it rose to 37% in opinion polls.

In a speech to a women&#x27;s symposium in July 2014, Cunliffe stated, &quot;I am sorry for being a man&quot;. He was commenting on domestic violence against women by men. His apology was regarded as insensitive, with Prime Minister John Key criticising the remark as &quot;a bit insulting to imply that all men are abusive&quot;.

With little time to make the structural changes needed to build a proper campaign and a party marked by continued infighting, Labour performed poorly in the public opinion polls during the run-up to the 2014 general election. It was, as Cunliffe was to say later, &quot;the craziest and in some ways the most unfortunate campaign in recorded memory&quot;.

====2014 general election====
Labour formally launched its campaign for 2014 general election in Auckland on 21 July. Cunliffe announced several flagship election policies, including a promise of free GP visits and prescriptions to pregnant women and those aged under 13 and over 65. In a speech he stated, &quot;We are basing our policies on a very old idea. That your healthcare is based on your health need, not on the size of your wallet.&quot;

He was criticised for taking a three-day skiing holiday in Queenstown at the start of the campaign.

His performance in the leadership debates was viewed as mixed. Key claimed a win in the 2 September &quot;The Press&quot; leaders&#x27; debate after Cunliffe could not answer whether family homes held in a trust would be exempt under Labour&#x27;s capital gains tax policy, but then went on to recover in the second and third debates.

Cunliffe&#x27;s Labour Party received 25.1% of the party vote and 32 seats, its lowest share of the vote since 1922, while the National Party gained a plurality with 47.0% of the party vote, its best result since 1951. Cunliffe initially vowed to remain as the party leader, in spite of the poor election result. On 27 September Cunliffe formally resigned as leader but announced he was re-contesting in the 2014 party leadership election. Later on 13 October, he announced he was pulling out of the leadership race.

===Political views===

Cunliffe is generally liberal when it comes to conscience issues. He voted in favour of the decriminalisation of prostitution, the establishment of civil unions, and the criminalisation of parental corporal punishment. He voted against defining marriage as between one man and one woman, and in 2013, he voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. In 2006, he voted in favour of raising the legal drinking age from 18 to 20, but voted against it in 2012.

Cunliffe has expressed a view that New Zealand will become a republic in the future. During a debate after the speech from the throne on 4 September 2002, Cunliffe spoke of &quot;Building a New Zealand ... where we journey together towards maturity as a nation, and to the Commonwealth republic I personally believe we will become before the Treaty turns 200&quot;.

== Life after politics ==
Following his retirement from Parliament on 21 April 2017, Cunliffe joined the New Zealand-based management consultancy firm Stakeholder Strategies as a partner, working for a range of public and private sector clients. He left the company in 2020. Since 2020 he has been a director of the Polis Consulting Group.

In the 2018 New Year Honours, Cunliffe was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, for services as a member of Parliament.

In February 2020, Cunliffe was also appointed as chair of the Selwyn Foundation, one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest independent charitable providers of services to older people and their families.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Cunliffe&#x27;s domestic partner is Anna Kominik. Kominik is the independent chair of the Electricity Retailers’ Association and the New Zealand Director of Zephyr Airworks. He has two sons from his previous marriage to Auckland lawyer Karen Price. Cunliffe&#x27;s father Bill was born in Ngahere in 1915 and worked at the railways. His great-grandfather, William Cunliffe, married Phoebe Seddon, the elder sister of Richard Seddon, who would later become known as &#x27;King Dick&#x27;. Seddon, New Zealand&#x27;s longest serving prime minister, was thus Cunliffe&#x27;s great-(great-)uncle.

===Religious views===
Cunliffe is the son of an Anglican minister, and was raised in the Church of England. He has described himself as a &quot;liberal Anglican,&quot; and an &quot;infrequent attender of church, but it&#x27;s a big part of my life.&quot;

<doc id="1070012" wikidata="Q1477253" url="?curid=1070012" title="Sunshine Coast (British Columbia)">
<text>The Sunshine Coast is a geographic subregion of the British Columbia Coast that generally comprises the regional districts of qathet and Sunshine Coast.

While populous and frequently visited by tourists, the Sunshine Coast can be reached only by ferry (commonly BC Ferries) or by floatplane, as no access roads have been built around or across the fjords separating it from the rest of the province. It can also be reached via private or chartered aircraft using the Sechelt Aerodrome (CAP3).

==Geography==
The Sunshine Coast is a subregion of the mainland coast of British Columbia. It is bound by Howe Sound to the southeast, Desolation Sound to the northwest, the Pacific Ranges to the northeast, and the Strait of Georgia to the southwest. The region is bisected by Jervis Inlet. The region features a coastal lowland that gradually transitions to steep-sided mountains as you move toward the northeast.

The major islands of the Sunshine Coast include Anvil Island, Gambier Island, Goat Island, Hernando Island, Keats Island, Savary Island, and most of the Northern Gulf Islands.

===Ecology===
The Coast&#x27;s wildlife includes cougars, black bears, wolves, marbled murrelet, orcas, great blue herons, seals, sea lions and bald eagles. There are also abundant tide pools with a variety of molluscs, sea anemones and fish.

At certain times of the year, seal pups may be encountered on the Coast&#x27;s beaches. They should not be approached, as the mother may abandon them. All wildlife on the Coast should be viewed from a safe and respectful distance.

===Climate===
The lowlands have a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Higher elevations feature a marine west coast climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers, mild winters, and moderate rainfall throughout the year.

==Demographics==
As of the 2016 census, the population of the Sunshine Coast totals 50,040:
* 29,970 in the Sunshine Coast Regional District
* 20,070 in qathet Regional District

===Major communities===
The major communities of the Sunshine Coast are as follows:
*Powell River (pop. 13,157)
*Sechelt (pop. 10,200)
*Gibsons (pop. 4,605)
*Roberts Creek (pop. 3,421)

==Economy==
Historically, the economy of the Sunshine Coast was driven primarily by industries such as logging and mining.

Today, forestry and tourism form much of the local economy.

==Culture==
The Sunshine Coast is home to more artists &quot;per capita&quot; than any other Canadian region. Purple flags along the Sunshine Coast Highway and local streets indicate artists&#x27;s studios where the public is welcome, and which feature many disciplines including painting, pottery and glassblowing.

==Transportation==
Due to its mountainous terrain, the Sunshine Coast is not directly linked over land to the surrounding coast. Instead, BC Ferries provides ferry service linking the coast to surrounding regions. Notable lines include Horseshoe Bay-Langdale, Little River-Westview, and Earls Cove-Saltery Bay. Minor ferry operators and water taxis provide service to minor islands dotting the strait.

The region is served by British Columbia Highway 101, which runs along the coast between the communities of Langdale and Lund.

==Attractions==
Some attractions specific to the Sunshine Coast include:
* Copeland Islands Marine Provincial Park
* Desolation Sound Marine Provincial Park
* Hidden Grove/Sechelt Heritage Forest
* Skookumchuck Narrows Provincial Park
* Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park
* Spipiyus Provincial Park
* tems swiya Museum - showcasing history and culture of the shíshálh people
* The northern terminus of Highway 101, which is located in the town of Lund

The region also features two notable trails:
* Powell Forest Canoe Route - a canoeing route through various lakes north of Powell River
* Sunshine Coast Trail - a long hiking trail between Saltery Bay and Sarah Point

<doc id="1070016" wikidata="Q154705" url="?curid=1070016" title="Unification of Germany">
<text>The unification of Germany (, ) was a process of building the first nation-state for Germans with federal features based on the concept of Lesser Germany (one without Habsburgs&#x27; multi-ethnic Austria or its German-speaking part). It commenced on 18 August 1866 with adoption of the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the North German Confederation, initially a military alliance &quot;de facto&quot; dominated by Prussia which was subsequently deepened through adoption of the North German Constitution.

The process symbolically concluded when most of the south German states joined the North German Confederation with the ceremonial proclamation of the German Empire i.e. the German Reich having 25 member states and led by the Kingdom of Prussia of Hohenzollerns on 18 January 1871; the event was later celebrated as the customary date of the German Empire&#x27;s foundation, although the legally meaningful events relevant to the accomplishment of unification occurred on 1 January 1871 (accession of South German states and constitutional adoption of the name &quot;German Empire&quot;), 4 May 1871 (entry into force of the permanent Constitution of the German Empire) and 10 May 1871 (Treaty of Frankfurt and recognition of the Empire by the French Third Republic).

Despite the legal, administrative, and political disruption caused by the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German-speaking people of the old Empire had a common linguistic, cultural, and legal tradition. European liberalism offered an intellectual basis for unification by challenging dynastic and absolutist models of social and political organization; its German manifestation emphasized the importance of tradition, education, and linguistic unity. Economically, the creation of the Prussian (customs union) in 1818, and its subsequent expansion to include other states of the Austria (under Austrian Empire)-led German Confederation, reduced competition between and within states. Emerging modes of transportation facilitated business and recreational travel, leading to contact and sometimes conflict between and among German-speakers from throughout Central Europe. The model of diplomatic spheres of influence resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe through Habsburg leadership of the German Confederation, designed to replace the Holy Roman Empire. The negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia&#x27;s growing strength within and declined to create a second coalition of the German states under Prussia&#x27;s influence, and so failed to foresee that Prussia (Kingdom of Prussia) would rise to challenge Austria for leadership of the German peoples. This German dualism presented two solutions to the problem of unification: , the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or , the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria or its German-speaking part), ultimately settled in favor of the former solution in the Peace of Prague.

Historians debate whether Otto von Bismarck—Minister President of Prussia—had a master plan to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the remaining independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand the power of the Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck&#x27;s led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize their political, economic, military, and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–1814. By establishing a Germany without multi-ethnic Austria (under Austria-Hungary) or its German-speaking part, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism.

Despite undergoing in the later years several further changes of its name and borders, overhauls of its constitutional system, periods of limited sovereignty and interrupted unity of its territory or government, and despite dissolution of its dominant founding federated state, the polity resulting from the unification process continues its existence, surviving until today in its contemporary form known as the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Early history ==

Germans emerged in medieval times among the descendants of the Romanized Germanic peoples in the area of modern western Germany, between the Rhine and Elbe rivers, particularly the Franks, Frisians, Saxons, Thuringii, Alemanni, and Baiuvarii. The region was divided into long-lasting divisions, or &quot;Stem duchies&quot;, based upon these ethnic designations, under the dominance of the western Franks starting with Clovis I, who established control of the Romanized and Frankish population of Gaul in the 5th century, and began a new process of conquering the peoples east of the Rhine. In subsequent centuries the power of the Franks grew considerably. By the early 9th century AD, large parts of Europe had been united under the rule of the Frankish leader Charlemagne, who expanded the Frankish Empire (Francia) in several directions including east of the Rhine, where he conquered Saxons and Frisians. A confederated realm of German princedoms, along with some adjacent lands, had been in existence for over a thousand years; dating to the Treaty of Verdun i.e. the establishment of East Francia from eastern Frankish Empire in east of the Rhine in 843, especially when the Ottonian dynasty took power to rule East Francia in 919. The realm later in 962 made up the core of the Holy Roman Empire, which at times included more than 1,000 entities and was called the &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; from 1512 with the Diet of Cologne (new title was adopted partly because the Empire lost most of its territories in Italy and Burgundy to the south and west by the late 15th century, but also to emphasize the new importance of the German Imperial Estates in ruling the Empire due to the Imperial Reform). The states of the Holy Roman Empire ranged in size from the small and complex territories of the princely Hohenlohe family branches to sizable, well-defined territories such as the Electorate of Bavaria, the Margraviate of Brandenburg or the Kingdom of Bohemia. Their governance varied: they included free imperial cities, also of different sizes, such as the powerful Augsburg and the minuscule Weil der Stadt; ecclesiastical territories, also of varying sizes and influence, such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne; and dynastic states such as Württemberg. Among the German-speaking states, the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords, between jurisdictions, and within jurisdictions. Through the organization of imperial circles (&quot;Reichskreise&quot;), groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests, including economic cooperation and military protection.l

== Early modern era and Eighteenth century ==

Since the 15th century, with few exceptions, the Empire&#x27;s Prince-electors had chosen successive heads of the House of Habsburg from the Duchy of Austria to hold the title of Holy Roman Emperor. Although they initially sought to restore central Imperial power, preserving a weak and fragmented Empire was convenient for France and Sweden, and therefore, their ensuing intervention led to the Peace of Westphalia which effectively thwarted for centuries any serious attempts to reinforce the imperial central authority and petrified fragmentation, resulting in the German-speaking territories comprising on the eve of the Napoleonic Wars still more than 300 political entities, most of them being parts of the Holy Roman Empire, though portions of the extensive Habsburg Monarchy (exclusively its large non-German-speaking territories: Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen and the Austrian partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) or of the Hohenzollern Kingdom of Prussia (both the German-speaking former Duchy of Prussia and the non-German-speaking entire territory of the Prussian partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) as well as the German-speaking Swiss cantons were outside of the Imperial borders. This became known as the practice of (&quot;small-statery&quot;) As a further consequence, there was no German national identity in development as late as 1800, mainly due to the highly autonomous or semi-independent nature of the princely states; most inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire, outside of those ruled by the emperor directly, identified themselves mainly with their prince rather than with the Empire or the nation as a whole. However, by the 19th century, transportation and communications improvements started to bring these regions closer together.

== Dissolution of the Old Empire ==
Invasion of the Holy Roman Empire by the First French Empire in the War of the Second Coalition (1798–1802) resulted in crushing the Empire and allied forces by Napoleon Bonaparte. The treaties of Lunéville (1801) and the Mediatization of 1803 secularized the ecclesiastical principalities and abolished most free imperial cities and these territories along with their inhabitants were absorbed by dynastic states. This transfer particularly enhanced the territories of Württemberg and Baden. In 1806, after a successful invasion of Prussia and the defeat of Prussia at the joint battles of Jena-Auerstedt 1806 during the War of the Third Coalition, Napoleon dictated the Treaty of Pressburg which included the formal dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the abdication of Emperor Francis II from the nominal reign over it. Napoleon established instead a German client state of France known as the Confederation of the Rhine which, &quot;inter alia&quot;, provided for the mediatization of over a hundred petty princes and counts and the absorption of their territories, as well as those of hundreds of imperial knights, by the Confederation&#x27;s member-states. Several states were promoted to kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Kingdom of Saxony or the Kingdom of Hanover. Following the formal secession from the Empire of the majority of its constituent states, the Emperor dissolved the Holy Roman Empire. In his abdication, Francis released all former estates from their duties and obligations to him, and took upon himself solely the title of Emperor of Austria, which had been established since 1804.

== Rise of German nationalism under Napoleon ==

Under the hegemony of the First French Empire (1804–1814), popular German nationalism thrived in the reorganized German states. Due in part to the shared experience, albeit under French dominance, various justifications emerged to identify &quot;Germany&quot; as a potential future single state. For the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte,

A common language may have been seen to serve as the basis of a nation, but as contemporary historians of 19th-century Germany noted, it took more than linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities. The experience of German-speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands. The Napoleon&#x27;s campaigns in Poland (1806–07) resulting in his decision to re-establish a form of Polish statehood (the Duchy of Warsaw) at the cost of also Prussian-conquered Polish territories, as well as his campaigns on Iberian Peninsula, in western Germany, and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 disillusioned many Germans, princes and peasants alike. Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System nearly ruined the Central European economy. The invasion of Russia included nearly 125,000 troops from German lands, and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans, both high- and low-born, to envision a Central Europe free of Napoleon&#x27;s influence. The creation of student militias such as the Lützow Free Corps exemplified this tendency.

The debacle in Russia loosened the French grip on the German princes. In 1813, Napoleon mounted a campaign in the German states to bring them back into the French orbit; the subsequent War of Liberation culminated in the great Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations. In October 1813, more than 500,000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days, making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century. The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the Coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. As a result, the Confederation of the Rhine collapsed and the French period came to an end. Success encouraged the Coalition forces to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine; his army and his government collapsed, and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on Elba. During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the 100 Days of 1815, forces of the Seventh Coalition, including an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard von Blücher, were victorious at Waterloo (18 June 1815). The critical role played by Blücher&#x27;s troops, especially after having to retreat from the field at Ligny the day before, helped to turn the tide of combat against the French. The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June, sealing the allied victory. From the German perspective, the actions of Blücher&#x27;s troops at Waterloo, and the combined efforts at Leipzig, offered a rallying point of pride and enthusiasm. This interpretation became a key building block of the &quot;Borussian&quot; myth expounded by the pro-Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century.

== Congress of Vienna and the rise of German dualism ==

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the Congress of Vienna established a new European political-diplomatic system based on the balance of power. This system reorganized Europe into spheres of influence, which, in some cases, suppressed the aspirations of the various nationalities, including the Germans and Italians.

Generally, an enlarged Prussia and the 38 other states consolidated from the mediatized territories of 1803 were confederated within the Austrian Empire&#x27;s sphere of influence. The Congress established a loose German Confederation (1815–1866), headed by Austria, with a &quot;Federal Diet&quot; (called the &quot;Bundestag&quot; or &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot;, an assembly of appointed leaders) that met in the city of Frankfurt am Main. Its borders resembled those of its predecessor, the Holy Roman Empire (though there were some deviations e.g. Prussian territory in the Confederation was extended to include also the formerly Polish territories of the Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the former Starostwo of Draheim, while Austrian part was extended to include in the years 1818–1850 also the formerly Polish territories of the Duchy of Oświęcim and the Duchy of Zator), meaning that large portions of both Prussia and Austria were left outside. In recognition of the imperial position traditionally held by the Habsburgs, the emperors of Austria became the titular presidents of this parliament. Despite the nomenclature of &quot;Diet&quot; (Assembly or Parliament), this institution should in no way be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to a small portion of the male population.

=== Problems of reorganization ===

Problematically, the built-in Austrian dominance failed to take into account Prussia&#x27;s 18th-century emergence in Imperial politics. This impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics. Ever since the Prince-Elector of Brandenburg had made himself King in Prussia at the beginning of that century, their domains had steadily increased through inheritance and war. Prussia&#x27;s consolidated strength had become especially apparent during the Partitions of Poland, the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years&#x27; War under Frederick the Great. As Maria Theresa and Joseph tried to restore Habsburg hegemony in the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick countered with the creation of the &quot;Fürstenbund&quot; (Union of Princes) in 1785. Austrian-Prussian dualism lay firmly rooted in old Imperial politics. Those balance of power manoeuvers were epitomized by the War of the Bavarian Succession, or &quot;Potato War&quot; among common folk. Even after the end of the Holy Roman Empire, this competition influenced the growth and development of nationalist movements in the 19th century.

==Prelude==
=== &quot;Vormärz&quot; ===

The period of Austrian and Prussian police-states and vast censorship between the Congress of Vienna and the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany later became widely known as the &quot;Vormärz&quot; (&quot;before March&quot;), referring to March 1848. During this period, European liberalism gained momentum; the agenda included economic, social, and political issues. Most European liberals in the &quot;Vormärz&quot; sought unification under nationalist principles, promoted the transition to capitalism, sought the expansion of male suffrage, among other issues. Their &quot;radicalness&quot; depended upon where they stood on the spectrum of male suffrage: the wider the definition of suffrage, the more radical.

The surge of German nationalism, stimulated by the experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect its roots in the experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the German Campaign of 1813 engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved.

==== Emergence of liberal nationalism and conservative response ====

Despite considerable conservative reaction, ideas of unity joined with notions of popular sovereignty in German-speaking lands. The &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe.

At the Wartburg Festival in 1817 the first real movements among the students were formed – fraternities and student organizations emerged. The colors black, red and gold were symbolic of this. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment.

The assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement. Metternich was able to harness conservative outrage at the assassination to consolidate legislation that would further limit the press and constrain the rising liberal and nationalist movements. Consequently, these decrees drove the &quot;Burschenschaften&quot; underground, restricted the publication of nationalist materials, expanded censorship of the press and private correspondence, and limited academic speech by prohibiting university professors from encouraging nationalist discussion. The decrees were the subject of Johann Joseph von Görres&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Teutschland [archaic: Deutschland] und die Revolution&quot; (&quot;Germany and the Revolution&quot;) (1820), in which he concluded that it was both impossible and undesirable to repress the free utterance of public opinion by reactionary measures.

The Hambach Festival (&quot;Hambacher Fest&quot;) in May 1832 was attended by a crowd of more than 30,000. Promoted as a county fair, its participants celebrated fraternity, liberty, and national unity. Celebrants gathered in the town below and marched to the ruins of Hambach Castle on the heights above the small town of Hambach, in the Palatinate province of Bavaria. Carrying flags, beating drums, and singing, the participants took the better part of the morning and mid-day to arrive at the castle grounds, where they listened to speeches by nationalist orators from across the conservative to radical political spectrum. The overall content of the speeches suggested a fundamental difference between the German nationalism of the 1830s and the French nationalism of the July Revolution: the focus of German nationalism lay in the education of the people; once the populace was educated as to what was needed, they would accomplish it. The Hambach rhetoric emphasized the overall peaceable nature of German nationalism: the point was not to build barricades, a very &quot;French&quot; form of nationalism, but to build emotional bridges between groups. As he had done in 1819, after the Kotzebue assassination, Metternich used the popular demonstration at Hambach to push conservative social policy. The &quot;Six Articles&quot; of 28 June 1832 primarily reaffirmed the principle of monarchical authority. On 5 July, the Frankfurt Diet voted for an additional 10 articles, which reiterated existing rules on censorship, restricted political organizations, and limited other public activity. Furthermore, the member states agreed to send military assistance to any government threatened by unrest. Prince Wrede led half of the Bavarian army to the Palatinate to &quot;subdue&quot; the province. Several hapless Hambach speakers were arrested, tried and imprisoned; one, Karl Heinrich Brüggemann (1810–1887), a law student and representative of the secretive &quot;Burschenschaft&quot;, was sent to Prussia, where he was first condemned to death, but later pardoned.

Crucially, both the Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any clear-cut program of unification. At Hambach, the positions of the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the &quot;Volk&quot; (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.

==== Economy and the customs union ====

Several other factors complicated the rise of nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests, and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, and again in the 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged as a result of a shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.

The economic, social and cultural dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure of most of the governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.

Formation of the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, an institution key to unifying the German states economically, helped to create a larger sense of economic unification. Initially conceived by the Prussian Finance Minister Hans, Count von Bülow, as a Prussian customs union in 1818, the &quot;Zollverein&quot; linked the many Prussian and Hohenzollern territories. Over the ensuing thirty years (and more) other German states joined. The Union helped to reduce protectionist barriers between the German states, especially improving the transport of raw materials and finished goods, making it both easier to move goods across territorial borders and less costly to buy, transport, and sell raw materials. This was particularly important for the emerging industrial centers, most of which were located in the Prussian regions of the Rhineland, the Saar, and the Ruhr valleys. States more distant from the coast joined the Customs Union earlier. Not being a member mattered more for the states of south Germany, since the external tariff of the Customs Union prevented customs-free access to the coast (which gave access to international markets). Thus, by 1836, all states to the south of Prussia had joined the Customs Union, except Austria.

In contrast, the coastal states already had barrier free access to international trade and did not want consumers and producers burdened with the import duties they would pay if they were within the Zollverein customs border. Hanover on the north coast formed its own customs union – the &quot;Tax Union&quot; or Steuerverein – in 1834 with Brunswick and with Oldenburg in 1836. The external tariffs on finished goods and overseas raw materials were below the rates of the Zollverein. Brunswick joined the Zollverein Customs Union in 1842, while Hanover and Oldenburg finally joined in 1854 After the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg were annexed by Prussia and thus annexed also to the Customs Union, while the two Mecklenburg states and the city states of Hamburg and Bremen joined late because they were reliant on international trade. The Mecklenburgs joined in 1867, while Bremen and Hamburg joined in 1888.

==== Roads and railways ====
By the early 19th century, German roads had deteriorated to an appalling extent. Travelers, both foreign and local, complained bitterly about the state of the &quot;Heerstraßen&quot;, the military roads previously maintained for the ease of moving troops. As German states ceased to be a military crossroads, however, the roads improved; the length of hard–surfaced roads in Prussia increased from in 1816 to in 1852, helped in part by the invention of macadam. By 1835, Heinrich von Gagern wrote that roads were the &quot;veins and arteries of the body politic...&quot; and predicted that they would promote freedom, independence and prosperity.As people moved around, they came into contact with others, on trains, at hotels, in restaurants, and for some, at fashionable resorts such as the spa in Baden-Baden. Water transportation also improved. The blockades on the Rhine had been removed by Napoleon&#x27;s orders, but by the 1820s, steam engines freed riverboats from the cumbersome system of men and animals that towed them upstream. By 1846, 180 steamers plied German rivers and Lake Constance, and a network of canals extended from the Danube, the Weser, and the Elbe rivers.

As important as these improvements were, they could not compete with the impact of the railway. German economist Friedrich List called the railways and the Customs Union &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;, emphasizing their important relationship to one another. He was not alone: the poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote a poem in which he extolled the virtues of the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, which he began with a list of commodities that had contributed more to German unity than politics or diplomacy. Historians of the German Empire later regarded the railways as the first indicator of a unified state; the patriotic novelist, Wilhelm Raabe, wrote: &quot;The German empire was founded with the construction of the first railway...&quot; Not everyone greeted the &quot;iron monster&quot; with enthusiasm. The Prussian king Frederick William III saw no advantage in traveling from Berlin to Potsdam a few hours faster, and Metternich refused to ride in one at all. Others wondered if the railways were an &quot;evil&quot; that threatened the landscape: Nikolaus Lenau&#x27;s 1838 poem &quot;An den Frühling&quot; (&quot;To Spring&quot;) bemoaned the way trains destroyed the pristine quietude of German forests.

The Bavarian Ludwig Railway, which was the first passenger or freight rail line in the German lands, connected Nuremberg and Fürth in 1835. Although it was long and only operated in daylight, it proved both profitable and popular. Within three years, of track had been laid, by 1840, , and by 1860, . Lacking a geographically central organizing feature (such as a national capital), the rails were laid in webs, linking towns and markets within regions, regions within larger regions, and so on. As the rail network expanded, it became cheaper to transport goods: in 1840, 18 &quot;Pfennigs&quot; per ton per kilometer and in 1870, five &quot;Pfennigs&quot;. The effects of the railway were immediate. For example, raw materials could travel up and down the Ruhr Valley without having to unload and reload. Railway lines encouraged economic activity by creating demand for commodities and by facilitating commerce. In 1850, inland shipping carried three times more freight than railroads; by 1870, the situation was reversed, and railroads carried four times more. Rail travel changed how cities looked and how people traveled. Its impact reached throughout the social order, affecting the highest born to the lowest. Although some of the outlying German provinces were not serviced by rail until the 1890s, the majority of the population, manufacturing centers, and production centers were linked to the rail network by 1865.

==== Geography, patriotism and language ====

As travel became easier, faster, and less expensive, Germans started to see unity in factors &quot;other&quot; than their language. The Brothers Grimm, who compiled a massive dictionary known as &quot;The Grimm&quot;, also assembled a compendium of folk tales and fables, which highlighted the story-telling parallels between different regions. Karl Baedeker wrote guidebooks to different cities and regions of Central Europe, indicating places to stay, sites to visit, and giving a short history of castles, battlefields, famous buildings, and famous people. His guides also included distances, roads to avoid, and hiking paths to follow.

The words of August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben expressed not only the linguistic unity of the German people but also their geographic unity. In &quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles&quot;, officially called &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Germans&quot;), Fallersleben called upon sovereigns throughout the German states to recognize the unifying characteristics of the German people. Such other patriotic songs as &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot; (&quot;The Watch on the Rhine&quot;) by Max Schneckenburger began to focus attention on geographic space, not limiting &quot;Germanness&quot; to a common language. Schneckenburger wrote &quot;The Watch on the Rhine&quot; in a specific patriotic response to French assertions that the Rhine was France&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; eastern boundary. In the refrain, &quot;Dear fatherland, dear fatherland, put your mind to rest / The watch stands true on the Rhine&quot;, and in such other patriotic poetry as Nicholaus Becker&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheinlied&quot; (&quot;The Rhine&quot;), Germans were called upon to defend their territorial homeland. In 1807, Alexander von Humboldt argued that national character reflected geographic influence, linking landscape to people. Concurrent with this idea, movements to preserve old fortresses and historic sites emerged, and these particularly focused on the Rhineland, the site of so many confrontations with France and Spain.

=== German revolutions and Polish uprising of 1848–1849 ===

The widespread—mainly German—revolutions of 1848–49 sought unification of Germany under a single constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the Rhineland, for a parliamentary assembly that would have the responsibility to draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage, a permanent national parliament, and a unified Germany, possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king. This seemed to be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Meanwhile, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially, a form of loose unification. Finally, the Polish majority living in the share of Polish territory annexed by Prussia pursued their own liberation agenda.

==== Frankfurt Parliament====
Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the Prussian three-class franchise, which weighted votes based on the amount of taxes paid and therefore gave some electoral groups—chiefly the wealthier, landed ones—greater representative power.

On 27 March 1849, the Frankfurt Parliament passed the &quot;Paulskirchenverfassung&quot; (Constitution of St. Paul&#x27;s Church) and offered the title of &quot;Kaiser&quot; (Emperor) to the Prussian king Frederick William IV the next month. He refused for a variety of reasons. Publicly, he replied that he could not accept a crown without the consent of the actual states, by which he meant the princes. Privately, he feared opposition from the other German princes and military intervention from Austria or Russia. He also held a fundamental distaste for the idea of accepting a crown from a popularly elected parliament: he would not accept a crown of &quot;clay&quot;. Despite franchise requirements that often perpetuated many of the problems of sovereignty and political participation liberals sought to overcome, the Frankfurt Parliament did manage to draft a constitution and reach an agreement on the &quot;kleindeutsch&quot; solution. While the liberals failed to achieve the unification they sought, they did manage to gain a partial victory by working with the German princes on many constitutional issues and collaborating with them on reforms.

==== The aborted 1848–1849 German Empire in retrospective analysis ====

Scholars of German history have engaged in decades of debate over how the successes and failures of the Frankfurt Parliament contribute to the historiographical explanations of German nation building. One school of thought, which emerged after The Great War and gained momentum in the aftermath of World War II, maintains that the failure of German liberals in the Frankfurt Parliament led to bourgeoisie compromise with conservatives (especially the conservative Junker landholders), which subsequently led to the so-called &quot;Sonderweg&quot; (distinctive path) of 20th-century German history. Failure to achieve unification in 1848, this argument holds, resulted in the late formation of the nation-state in 1871, which in turn delayed the development of positive national values. Hitler often called on the German public to sacrifice all for the cause of their great nation, but his regime did not create German nationalism: it merely capitalized on an intrinsic cultural value of German society that still remains prevalent even to this day. Furthermore, this argument maintains, the &quot;failure&quot; of 1848 reaffirmed latent aristocratic longings among the German middle class; consequently, this group never developed a self-conscious program of modernization.

More recent scholarship has rejected this idea, claiming that Germany did not have an actual &quot;distinctive path&quot; any more than any other nation, a historiographic idea known as exceptionalism. Instead, modern historians claim 1848 saw specific achievements by the liberal politicians. Many of their ideas and programs were later incorporated into Bismarck&#x27;s social programs (e.g., social insurance, education programs, and wider definitions of suffrage). In addition, the notion of a distinctive path relies upon the underlying assumption that some other nation&#x27;s path (in this case, the United Kingdom&#x27;s) is the accepted norm. This new argument further challenges the norms of the British-centric model of development: studies of national development in Britain and other &quot;normal&quot; states (e.g., France or the United States) have suggested that even in these cases, the modern nation-state did not develop evenly. Nor did it develop particularly early, being rather a largely mid-to-late-19th-century phenomenon. Since the end of the 1990s, this view has become widely accepted, although some historians still find the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; analysis helpful in understanding the period of National Socialism.

=== Problem of spheres of influence: The Erfurt Union and the Punctation of Olmütz ===
After the Frankfurt Parliament disbanded, Frederick William IV, under the influence of General Joseph Maria von Radowitz, supported the establishment of the Erfurt Union—a federation of German states, excluding Austria—by the free agreement of the German princes. This limited union under Prussia would have almost eliminated Austrian influence on the other German states. Combined diplomatic pressure from Austria and Russia (a guarantor of the 1815 agreements that established European spheres of influence) forced Prussia to relinquish the idea of the Erfurt Union at a meeting in the small town of Olmütz in Moravia. In November 1850, the Prussians—specifically Radowitz and Frederick William—agreed to the restoration of the German Confederation under Austrian leadership. This became known as the Punctation of Olmütz, but among Prussians it was known as the &quot;Humiliation of Olmütz.&quot;

Although seemingly minor events, the Erfurt Union proposal and the Punctation of Olmütz brought the problems of influence in the German states into sharp focus. The question became not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but rather &quot;when&quot; unification would occur, and &quot;when&quot; was contingent upon strength. One of the former Frankfurt Parliament members, Johann Gustav Droysen, summed up the problem:

Unification under these conditions raised a basic diplomatic problem. The possibility of German (or Italian) unification would overturn the overlapping spheres of influence system created in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna. The principal architects of this convention, Metternich, Castlereagh, and Tsar Alexander (with his foreign secretary Count Karl Nesselrode), had conceived of and organized a Europe balanced and guaranteed by four &quot;great powers&quot;: Great Britain, France, Russia, and Austria, with each power having a geographic sphere of influence. France&#x27;s sphere included the Iberian Peninsula and a share of influence in the Italian states. Russia&#x27;s included the eastern regions of Central Europe and a balancing influence in the Balkans. Austria&#x27;s sphere expanded throughout much of the Central European territories formerly held by the Holy Roman Empire. Britain&#x27;s sphere was the rest of the world, especially the seas.

This sphere of influence system depended upon the fragmentation of the German and Italian states, not their consolidation. Consequently, a German nation united under one banner presented significant questions. There was no readily applicable definition for who the German people would be or how far the borders of a German nation would stretch. There was also uncertainty as to who would best lead and defend &quot;Germany&quot;, however it was defined. Different groups offered different solutions to this problem. In the &quot;Kleindeutschland&quot; (&quot;Lesser Germany&quot;) solution, the German states would be united under the leadership of the Prussian Hohenzollerns; in the &quot;Grossdeutschland&quot; (&quot;Greater Germany&quot;) solution, the German states would be united under the leadership of the Austrian Habsburgs. This controversy, the latest phase of the German dualism debate that had dominated the politics of the German states and Austro-Prussian diplomacy since the 1701 creation of the Kingdom of Prussia, would come to a head during the following twenty years.

=== External expectations of a unified Germany ===
Other nationalists had high hopes for the German unification movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, &quot;The progress of humanity seems to have come to a halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation [that] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed.&quot; Garibaldi looked to Germany for the &quot;kind of leadership [that], in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression.&quot;
German unification had also been viewed as a prerequisite for the creation of a European federation, which Giuseppe Mazzini and other European patriots had been promoting for more than three decades:
=== Prussia&#x27;s growing strength: &quot;Realpolitik&quot; ===

King Frederick William IV suffered a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother William becoming prince regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857, and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859. This shuffling of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing the Prussian army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially how to pay for them) caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control over the military budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed Otto von Bismarck to the position of Minister-President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.

The Crimean War of 1854–55 and the Italian War of 1859 disrupted relations among Great Britain, France, Austria, and Russia. In the aftermath of this disarray, the convergence of von Moltke&#x27;s operational redesign, von Roon and Wilhelm&#x27;s army restructure, and Bismarck&#x27;s diplomacy influenced the realignment of the European balance of power. Their combined agendas established Prussia as the leading German power through a combination of foreign diplomatic triumphs—backed up by the possible use of Prussian military might—and an internal conservatism tempered by pragmatism, which came to be known as &quot;Realpolitik&quot;.

Bismarck expressed the essence of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; in his subsequently famous &quot;Blood and Iron&quot; speech to the Budget Committee of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies on 30 September 1862, shortly after he became Minister President: &quot;The great questions of the time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions—that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849—but by iron and blood.&quot; Bismarck&#x27;s words, &quot;iron and blood&quot; (or &quot;blood and iron&quot;, as often attributed), have often been misappropriated as evidence of a German lust for blood and power. First, the phrase from his speech &quot;the great questions of time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions&quot; is often interpreted as a repudiation of the political process—a repudiation Bismarck did not himself advocate. Second, his emphasis on blood and iron did not imply simply the unrivaled military might of the Prussian army but rather two important aspects: the ability of the assorted German states to produce iron and other related war materials and the willingness to use those war materials if necessary.

By 1862, when Bismarck made his speech, the idea of a German nation-state in the peaceful spirit of Pan-Germanism had shifted from the liberal and democratic character of 1848 to accommodate Bismarck&#x27;s more conservative &quot;Realpolitik&quot;. Bismarck sought to link a unified state to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which for some historians remains one of Bismarck&#x27;s primary contributions to the creation of the German Empire in 1871. While the conditions of the treaties binding the various German states to one another prohibited Bismarck from taking unilateral action, the politician and diplomat in him realized the impracticality of this. To get the German states to unify, Bismarck needed a single, outside enemy that would declare war on one of the German states first, thus providing a &quot;casus belli&quot; to rally all Germans behind. This opportunity arose with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Historians have long debated Bismarck&#x27;s role in the events leading up to the war. The traditional view, promulgated in large part by late 19th- and early 20th-century pro-Prussian historians, maintains that Bismarck&#x27;s intent was always German unification. Post-1945 historians, however, see more short-term opportunism and cynicism in Bismarck&#x27;s manipulation of the circumstances to create a war, rather than a grand scheme to unify a nation-state. Regardless of motivation, by manipulating events of 1866 and 1870, Bismarck demonstrated the political and diplomatic skill that had caused Wilhelm to turn to him in 1862.

Three episodes proved fundamental to the unification of Germany. First, the death without male heirs of Frederick VII of Denmark led to the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. Second, the unification of Italy provided Prussia an ally against Austria in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Finally, France—fearing Hohenzollern encirclement—declared war on Prussia in 1870, resulting in the Franco-Prussian War. Through a combination of Bismarck&#x27;s diplomacy and political leadership, von Roon&#x27;s military reorganization, and von Moltke&#x27;s military strategy, Prussia demonstrated that none of the European signatories of the 1815 peace treaty could guarantee Austria&#x27;s sphere of influence in Central Europe, thus achieving Prussian hegemony in Germany and ending the dualism debate.

=== The Schleswig-Holstein Question ===
The first episode in the saga of German unification under Bismarck came with the Schleswig-Holstein Question. On 15 November 1863, Christian IX became king of Denmark and duke of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg, which the Danish king held in personal union. On 18 November 1863, he signed the Danish November Constitution which replaced The Law of Sjælland and The Law of Jutland, which meant the new constitution applied to the Duchy of Schleswig. The German Confederation saw this act as a violation of the London Protocol of 1852, which emphasized the status of the Kingdom of Denmark as distinct from the three independent duchies. The German Confederation could use the ethnicities of the area as a rallying cry: Holstein and Lauenburg were largely of German origin and spoke German in everyday life, while Schleswig had a significant Danish population and history. Diplomatic attempts to have the November Constitution repealed collapsed, and fighting began when Prussian and Austrian troops crossed the Eider river on 1 February 1864.

Initially, the Danes attempted to defend their country using an ancient earthen wall known as the &quot;Danevirke&quot;, but this proved futile. The Danes were no match for the combined Prussian and Austrian forces and their modern armaments. The needle gun, one of the first bolt action rifles to be used in conflict, aided the Prussians in both this war and the Austro-Prussian War two years later. The rifle enabled a Prussian soldier to fire five shots while lying prone, while its muzzle-loading counterpart could only fire one shot and had to be reloaded while standing. The Second Schleswig War resulted in victory for the combined armies of Prussia and Austria, and the two countries won control of Schleswig and Holstein in the concluding peace of Vienna, signed on 30 October 1864.
=== War between Austria and Prussia, 1866 ===

The second episode in Bismarck&#x27;s unification efforts occurred in 1866. In concert with the newly formed Italy, Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia. The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt, where the two powers claimed to speak for all the German states in the parliament. In April 1866, the Prussian representative in Florence signed a secret agreement with the Italian government, committing each state to assist the other in a war against Austria. The next day, the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution, a directly elected national Diet, and universal suffrage. German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan, having witnessed Bismarck&#x27;s difficult and ambiguous relationship with the Prussian &quot;Landtag&quot; (State Parliament), a relationship characterized by Bismarck&#x27;s cajoling and riding roughshod over the representatives. These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform.

==== Choosing sides ====
The debate over the proposed national constitution became moot when news of Italian troop movements in Tyrol and near the Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866. The Austrian government ordered partial mobilization in the southern regions; the Italians responded by ordering full mobilization. Despite calls for rational thought and action, Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces, and the next day he began full-scale mobilization.

In the Diet, the group of middle-sized states, known as &quot;Mittelstaaten&quot; (Bavaria, Württemberg, the grand duchies of Baden and Hesse, and the duchies of Saxony–Weimar, Saxony–Meiningen, Saxony–Coburg, and Nassau), supported complete demobilization within the Confederation. These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle (or outright) threats Bismarck used to try to gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They also understood that Prussia&#x27;s only ally abroad was Italy.

Opposition to Prussia&#x27;s strong-armed tactics surfaced in other social and political groups. Throughout the German states, city councils, liberal parliamentary members who favored a unified state, and chambers of commerce—which would see great benefits from unification—opposed any war between Prussia and Austria. They believed any such conflict would only serve the interests of royal dynasties. Their own interests, which they understood as &quot;civil&quot; or &quot;bourgeois&quot;, seemed irrelevant. Public opinion also opposed Prussian domination. Catholic populations along the Rhine—especially in such cosmopolitan regions as Cologne and in the heavily populated Ruhr Valley—continued to support Austria. By late spring, most important states opposed Berlin&#x27;s effort to reorganize the German states by force. The Prussian cabinet saw German unity as an issue of power and a question of who had the strength and will to wield that power. Meanwhile, the liberals in the Frankfurt assembly saw German unity as a process of negotiation that would lead to the distribution of power among the many parties.

==== Austria isolated ====
Although several German states initially sided with Austria, they stayed on the defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria&#x27;s southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea.

A quick peace was essential to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria&#x27;s side. In the day-long Battle of Königgrätz, near the village of Sadová, Friedrich Carl and his troops arrived late, and in the wrong place. Once he arrived, however, he ordered his troops immediately into the fray. The battle was a decisive victory for Prussia and forced the Habsburgs to end the war with the unfavorable Peace of Prague, laying the groundwork for the &quot;Kleindeutschland&quot; (little Germany) solution, or &quot;Germany without Austria.&quot;

== Founding a unified state ==
=== Peace of Prague and the North German Confederation ===
The Peace of Prague sealed the dissolution of the German Confederation. Its former leading state, the Austrian Empire, was along with the majority of its allies excluded from the ensuing North German Confederation Treaty sponsored by Prussia which directly annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, and the city of Frankfurt, while Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but kept its statehood. At the same time, the original East Prussian cradle of the Prussian statehood as well as the Prussian-held Polish- or Kashubian-speaking territories of Province of Posen and West Prussia were formally annexed into the North German Confederation, thus Germany. Following adoption of the North German Constitution, the new state obtained its own constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures.

Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck&#x27;s influence had overcome Austria&#x27;s active resistance to the idea of a unified Germany. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia&#x27;s sphere of influence. Austria&#x27;s influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity, as many German states resented Prussian power politics.

=== Unified Italy and Austro-Hungarian Compromise ===

The Peace of Prague offered lenient terms to Austria but its relationship with the new nation-state of Italy underwent major restructuring. Although the Austrians were far more successful in the military field against Italian troops, the monarchy lost the important province of Venetia. The Habsburgs ceded Venetia to France, which then formally transferred control to Italy.

The end of Austrian dominance of the German states shifted Austria&#x27;s attention to the Balkans. The reality of defeat for Austria also caused a reevaluation of internal divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. In 1867, the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph accepted a settlement (the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867) in which he gave his Hungarian holdings equal status with his Austrian domains, creating the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary.

=== War with France ===

The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded &quot;Revanche pour Sadová&quot; (&quot;Revenge for Sadova&quot;), illustrating anti-Prussian sentiment in France—a problem that would accelerate in the months leading up to the Franco-Prussian War. The Austro-Prussian War also damaged relations with the French government. At a meeting in Biarritz in September 1865 with Napoleon III, Bismarck had let it be understood (or Napoleon had thought he understood) that France might annex parts of Belgium and Luxembourg in exchange for its neutrality in the war. These annexations did not happen, resulting in animosity from Napoleon towards Bismarck.

====Background====
By 1870 three of the important lessons of the Austro-Prussian war had become apparent. The first lesson was that, through force of arms, a powerful state could challenge the old alliances and spheres of influence established in 1815. Second, through diplomatic maneuvering, a skilful leader could create an environment in which a rival state would declare war first, thus forcing states allied with the &quot;victim&quot; of external aggression to come to the leader&#x27;s aid. Finally, as Prussian military capacity far exceeded that of Austria, Prussia was clearly the only state within the Confederation (or among the German states generally) capable of protecting all of them from potential interference or aggression. In 1866, most mid-sized German states had opposed Prussia, but by 1870 these states had been coerced and coaxed into mutually protective alliances with Prussia. If a European state declared war on one of their members, then they all would come to the defense of the attacked state. With skilful manipulation of European politics, Bismarck created a situation in which France would play the role of aggressor in German affairs, while Prussia would play that of the protector of German rights and liberties.

At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Metternich and his conservative allies had reestablished the Spanish monarchy under King Ferdinand VII. Over the following forty years, the great powers supported the Spanish monarchy, but events in 1868 would further test the old system, finally providing the external trigger needed by Bismarck.

==== Spanish prelude ====
A revolution in Spain overthrew Queen Isabella II, and the throne remained empty while Isabella lived in sumptuous exile in Paris. The Spanish, looking for a suitable Catholic successor, had offered the post to three European princes, each of whom was rejected by Napoleon III, who served as regional power-broker. Finally, in 1870 the Regency offered the crown to Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a prince of the Catholic cadet Hohenzollern line. The ensuing furor has been dubbed by historians as the Hohenzollern candidature. Over the next few weeks, the Spanish offer turned into the talk of Europe. Bismarck encouraged Leopold to accept the offer. A successful installment of a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen king in Spain would mean that two countries on either side of France would both have German kings of Hohenzollern descent. This may have been a pleasing prospect for Bismarck, but it was unacceptable to either Napoleon III or to Agenor, duc de Gramont, his minister of foreign affairs. Gramont wrote a sharply formulated ultimatum to Wilhelm, as head of the Hohenzollern family, stating that if any Hohenzollern prince should accept the crown of Spain, the French government would respond—although he left ambiguous the nature of such response. The prince withdrew as a candidate, thus defusing the crisis, but the French ambassador to Berlin would not let the issue lie. He approached the Prussian king directly while Wilhelm was vacationing in Ems Spa, demanding that the King release a statement saying he would never support the installation of a Hohenzollern on the throne of Spain. Wilhelm refused to give such an encompassing statement, and he sent Bismarck a dispatch by telegram describing the French demands. Bismarck used the king&#x27;s telegram, called the Ems Dispatch, as a template for a short statement to the press. With its wording shortened and sharpened by Bismarck—and further alterations made in the course of its translation by the French agency Havas—the Ems Dispatch raised an angry furor in France. The French public, still aggravated over the defeat at Sadová, demanded war.

==== Open hostilities and the disastrous end of the Second French Empire ====
Napoleon III had tried to secure territorial concessions from both sides before and after the Austro-Prussian War, but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations, he ended up with nothing. He then hoped that Austria would join in a war of revenge and that its former allies—particularly the southern German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria—would join in the cause. This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily—if not happily—to fight against France. Instead of a war of revenge against Prussia, supported by various German allies, France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own.

The reorganization of the military by von Roon and the operational strategy of Moltke combined against France to great effect. The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French, and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points—reminiscent of Napoleon I&#x27;s strategies seventy years earlier—overwhelmed French mobilization. Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid, Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and prepared to fight, whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones. After a number of battles, notably Spicheren, Wörth, Mars la Tour, and Gravelotte, the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of Metz and the French capital of Paris. They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at Sedan on 1 September 1870.

==== Proclamation of the German Empire ====
The humiliating capture of the French emperor and the loss of the French army itself, which marched into captivity at a makeshift camp in the Saarland (&quot;Camp Misery&quot;), threw the French government into turmoil; Napoleon&#x27;s energetic opponents overthrew his government and proclaimed the Third Republic. &quot;In the days after Sedan, Prussian envoys met with the French and demanded a large cash indemnity as well as the cession of Alsace and Lorraine. All parties in France rejected the terms, insisting that any armistice be forged &quot;on the basis of territorial integrity.&quot; France, in other words, would pay reparations for starting the war, but would, in Jules Favre&#x27;s famous phrase, &quot;cede neither a clod of our earth nor a stone of our fortresses&quot;. The German High Command expected an overture of peace from the French, but the new republic refused to surrender. The Prussian army invested Paris and held it under siege until mid-January, with the city being &quot;ineffectually bombarded&quot;. Nevertheless, in January, the Germans fired some 12,000 shells, 300–400 grenades daily into the city. On January 18, 1871, the German princes and senior military commanders proclaimed Wilhelm &quot;German Emperor&quot; in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Under the subsequent Treaty of Frankfurt, France relinquished most of its traditionally German regions (Alsace and the German-speaking part of Lorraine); paid an indemnity, calculated (on the basis of population) as the precise equivalent of the indemnity that Napoleon Bonaparte imposed on Prussia in 1807; and accepted German administration of Paris and most of northern France, with &quot;German troops to be withdrawn stage by stage with each installment of the indemnity payment&quot;.

==== War as ″the capstone of the unification process″ ====
Victory in the Franco-Prussian War proved the capstone of the unification process. In the first half of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states (aside from Austria) to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as &quot;Kaiser&quot;, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the &quot;Zollverein.&quot; The difficulties of the &quot;Vormärz&quot;, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon&#x27;s military reorganization, and von Moltke&#x27;s strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification. &quot;Einheit – unity – was achieved at the expense of Freiheit – freedom. The German Empire became,&quot; in Karl Marx&#x27;s words, &quot;a military despotism cloaked in parliamentary forms with a feudal ingredient, influenced by the bourgeoisie, festooned with bureaucrats and guarded by police.&quot; Indeed, many historians would see Germany&#x27;s &quot;escape into war&quot; in 1914 as a flight from all of the internal-political contradictions forged by Bismarck at Versailles in the fall of 1870.

=== Internal political and administrative unification ===

The new German Empire included 26 political entities: twenty-five constituent states (or &quot;Bundesstaaten&quot;) and one Imperial Territory (or &quot;Reichsland&quot;). It realized the &quot;Kleindeutsche Lösung&quot; (&quot;Lesser German Solution&quot;, with the exclusion of Austria) as opposed to a &quot;Großdeutsche Lösung&quot; or &quot;Greater German Solution&quot;, which would have included Austria. Unifying various states into one nation required more than some military victories, however much these might have boosted morale. It also required a rethinking of political, social, and cultural behaviors and the construction of new metaphors about &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. Who were the new members of this new nation? What did they stand for? How were they to be organized?

==== Constituent states of the Empire ====
Though often characterized as a federation of monarchs, the German Empire, strictly speaking, federated a group of 26 constituent entities with different forms of government, ranging from the main four constitutional monarchies to the three republican Hanseatic cities.


==== Political structure of the Empire ====

The 1866 North German Constitution became (with some semantic adjustments) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire. With this constitution, the new Germany acquired some democratic features: notably the Imperial Diet, which—in contrast to the parliament of Prussia—gave citizens representation on the basis of elections by direct and equal suffrage of all males who had reached the age of 25. Furthermore, elections were generally free of chicanery, engendering pride in the national parliament. However, legislation required the consent of the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;, the federal council of deputies from the states, in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto. Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies, with executive power vested in the Prussian King as &quot;Kaiser&quot;, who appointed the federal chancellor. The chancellor was accountable solely to, and served entirely at the discretion of, the Emperor. Officially, the chancellor functioned as a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. With the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty&#x27;s hegemonic home-kingdom, Prussia. The Imperial Diet had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills, but it could not initiate legislation. (The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor.) The other states retained their own governments, but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control. The militaries of the larger states (such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony) retained some autonomy, but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime.

==== Historical arguments and the Empire&#x27;s social anatomy ====
The &quot;Sonderweg&quot; hypothesis attributed Germany&#x27;s difficult 20th century to the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire. The Prussian landed elites, the &quot;Junkers&quot;, retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state. The &quot;Sonderweg&quot; hypothesis attributed their power to the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes, or by peasants in combination with the urban workers, in 1848 and again in 1871. Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the &quot;Junkers&quot; as a social group. This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the industrial leadership (the latter particularly important in the Rhineland) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire.

Additional studies of different groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all contributed to a new view of the period. Although the &quot;Junkers&quot; did, indeed, continue to control the officer corps, they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters as much as the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; theorists had hypothesized. Eastern &quot;Junker&quot; power had a counterweight in the western provinces in the form of the Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.

== Beyond the political mechanism: forming a nation ==
If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had lacked a constitution and administrative apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871. Yet, as Germans discovered, grand speeches, flags, and enthusiastic crowds, a constitution, a political reorganization, and the provision of an imperial superstructure; and the revised Customs Union of 1867–68, still did not make a nation.

A key element of the nation-state is the creation of a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire&#x27;s population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire&#x27;s population.

=== &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; ===

For some Germans, the definition of &quot;nation&quot; did not include pluralism, and Catholics in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics&#x27; connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As chancellor, Bismarck tried without much success to limit the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and of its party-political arm, the Catholic Centre Party, in schools and education- and language-related policies. The Catholic Centre Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, under the control of the state, resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.

=== Integrating the Jewish community ===

The Germanized Jews remained another vulnerable population in the new German nation-state. Since 1780, after emancipation by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, Jews in the former Habsburg territories had enjoyed considerable economic and legal privileges that their counterparts in other German-speaking territories did not: they could own land, for example, and they did not have to live in a Jewish quarter (also called the &quot;Judengasse&quot;, or &quot;Jews&#x27; alley&quot;). They could also attend universities and enter the professions. During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, many of the previously strong barriers between Jews and Christians broke down. Napoleon had ordered the emancipation of Jews throughout territories under French hegemony. Like their French counterparts, wealthy German Jews sponsored salons; in particular, several Jewish &quot;salonnières&quot; held important gatherings in Frankfurt and Berlin during which German intellectuals developed their own form of republican intellectualism. Throughout the subsequent decades, beginning almost immediately after the defeat of the French, reaction against the mixing of Jews and Christians limited the intellectual impact of these salons. Beyond the salons, Jews continued a process of Germanization in which they intentionally adopted German modes of dress and speech, working to insert themselves into the emerging 19th-century German public sphere. The religious reform movement among German Jews reflected this effort.

By the years of unification, German Jews played an important role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.

=== Writing the story of the nation ===
Another important element in nation-building, the story of the heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.

Heinrich von Treitschke&#x27;s &quot;History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century&quot;, published in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states, and it tells the story of the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia&#x27;s destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this &quot;Borussian&quot; myth (&quot;Borussia&quot; is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany&#x27;s savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia&#x27;s destiny to accomplish this. According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. The story continues by drawing on Prussia&#x27;s role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon&#x27;s power in 1815, at Waterloo, creating some semblance of economic unity, and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871.

Mommsen&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot; laid the groundwork for additional scholarship on the study of the German nation, expanding the notion of &quot;Germany&quot; to mean other areas beyond Prussia. A liberal professor, historian, and theologian, and generally a titan among late 19th-century scholars, Mommsen served as a delegate to the Prussian House of Representatives from 1863 to 1866 and 1873 to 1879; he also served as a delegate to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from 1881 to 1884, for the liberal German Progress Party (&quot;Deutsche Fortschrittspartei&quot;) and later for the National Liberal Party. He opposed the antisemitic programs of Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; and the vitriolic text that Treitschke often employed in the publication of his &quot;Studien über die Judenfrage&quot; (&quot;Studies of the Jewish Question&quot;), which encouraged assimilation and Germanization of Jews.

<text>Skookumchuck Narrows is a strait forming the entrance of Sechelt Inlet on British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast in Canada. Before broadening into Sechelt Inlet, all of its tidal flow together with that of Salmon Inlet and Narrows Inlet must pass through Sechelt Rapids. At peak flows, standing waves, whitecaps, and whirlpools form at the rapids even in calm weather. The narrows are also the site of Skookumchuck Narrows Provincial Park.

Each day, tides force large amounts of seawater through the narrows— of water on a tide. The difference in water levels on either side of the rapids can exceed in height. Current speeds can exceed , up to . It is sometimes claimed to be the fastest tidal rapids in the world.

The tidal patterns keep the water moving at virtually all times in the narrows area, which attracts a plethora of interesting sea life.

The unrelated B.C. town of Skookumchuck is several hundred kilometres east in the East Kootenay region of the province. Another location bearing this name, Skookumchuck Hot Springs, is on the Lillooet River east of Whistler. All locations take their name from Chinook Jargon for &quot;strong water&quot; and the term is common in maritime jargon for any set of strong rapids, particularly those at the mouth of inlets.

==In popular culture==
Skookumchuck Narrows features in the book &quot;A Whale Named Henry&quot;, the posthumously published second book by M. Wylie Blanchet, author of &quot;The Curve of Time&quot;.; The book is the story of a small whale who gets trapped behind the rapids.

<text>Iriy, Vyrai (, ), Vyriy (, ), or Irij (Croatian, Czech, Slovak: &quot;Ráj, Raj, Irij&quot;, ) is a mythical place in Slavic mythology where &quot;birds fly for the winter and souls go after death&quot; that is sometimes identified with paradise. Spring is believed to have arrived on Earth from Vyrai.

According to , initially the Early Slavs believed in only one Vyrai, connected to the deity known as Rod—it was apparently located far away beyond the sea, at the end of the Milky Way. According to folkloristic fables, the gates of Vyrai were guarded by Veles, who sometimes took the animal form of a raróg, grasping in its claws the keys to the otherworlds. It was often imagined as a garden beyond an iron gate that barred the living from entering, located in the crown of the cosmic tree. Whereas the branches were said to be nested by the birds, who were usually identified as human souls.

The etymological reconstruction of the word, supported by preserved beliefs, allows us to connect the Iriy with the oldest Slavic ideas about the other world, which is located underground or beyond the sea, where the path lies through water, in particular, through a whirlpool. The pagan Slavic peoples thought the birds flying away to Vyrai for the winter and returning to Earth for the spring to be human souls. According to some folk tales, the human soul departs the Earth for Vyrai during the cremation of its deceased flesh on a pyre; however, it does not stay in paradise forever, returning some time later to the womb of a pregnant woman (traces of reincarnation can be seen in this belief)—carried by a stork or nightjar.

Boris Uspenskij, having analyzed the extensive ethnographic material about Iriy, concluded that &quot;Iriy&quot; is a general designation of the otherworld (i.e., not a real geographical place).

==Etymology==
This term is sometimes said to be derived from &quot;rai&quot;, the Slavic word for paradise, but this is probably a folk etymology. It could be derived from the Proto-Slavic &quot;*rajъ&quot; in connection with the Persian &quot;rayí&quot; (wealth, happiness). Similarities to other languages have also been found, for example: the Greek &quot;éar&quot; (spring), Sanskrit &quot;áranyas&quot; (alien, distant), or the Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ūr-&quot; (water), but none of these three theories have found common recognition or approval.

==Heaven and hell==

Eventually the idea of Vyrai was split into two separate realms, most likely under the influence of Christianity. One Vyrai, for birds, was located in the heavens (simply another version of the original myth) and another underground for snakes/dragons, which is perceived as analogous to Christian hell. During the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Baptism of Poland, people were able to imagine heaven and hell based on the idea of Vyrai. 

==Vyrai and storks==
Storks carried unborn souls from Vyrai to Earth.

<doc id="1070051" wikidata="Q7889010" url="?curid=1070051" title="United Order">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, the United Order (also called the United Order of Enoch) was one of several 19th-century church collectivist programs. Early versions of the Order beginning in 1831 attempted to fully implement the law of consecration, a form of Christian communism or communalism, modeled after the Community of goods of the early church of Jerusalem which had &quot;all things in common&quot;. These early versions ended after a few years. Later versions within Mormonism, primarily in the Utah Territory, implemented less-ambitious cooperative programs, many of which were very successful. The Order&#x27;s full name invoked the city of Enoch, described in Latter Day Saint scripture as having such a virtuous and pure-hearted people that God had taken it to heaven.

The United Order established egalitarian communities designed to achieve income equality, eliminate poverty, and increase group self-sufficiency. The movement had much in common with other communalist utopian societies formed in the United States and Europe during the Second Great Awakening, which sought to govern aspects of people&#x27;s lives through precepts of faith and community organization. The Latter Day Saint United Order was more family- and property-oriented than the utopian experiments at Brook Farm and the Oneida Community. Membership in the United Order was voluntary, although during a period in the 1830s, it was a requirement of continued church membership. Participants would deed (consecrate) all their property to the United Order, which would in turn deed back an &quot;inheritance&quot; (or &quot;stewardship&quot;) which allowed members to control the property; private property was not eradicated but was rather a fundamental principle of this system. At the end of each year, any excess that the family produced from their stewardship was voluntarily given back to the Order. The Order in each community was operated by the local bishop.

The United Order is not practiced within mainstream Mormonism today; however, a number of groups of Mormon fundamentalists, such as the Apostolic United Brethren and Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church), have revived the practice. The United Order was also practiced by the liberal Mormon sect called the United Order Family of Christ and the Cutlerite sect the Church of Jesus Christ.

== Under Joseph Smith ==
Joseph Smith learned of a group of about 50 people known as &quot;the family&quot; living on Isaac Morley&#x27;s farm near Kirtland, Ohio, who had established a cooperative venture based on statements in the Book of Acts. Members of &quot;The Morley family&quot; were originally followers of Sidney Rigdon, a minister associated with the Restoration Movement who later converted to Mormonism. Many of these communalists also joined the new church and several, including Isaac Morley, served in leadership positions. Levi Hancock records an early event wherein a &quot;family member&quot; stole his pocket watch and sold it, claiming it was &quot;all in the family.&quot;

Smith was troubled because of the number of members joining the church in poverty in Kirtland, Ohio. Revenue was needed for the church to publish books and tracts. At this time, Smith and Rigdon were both in economic distress. Smith and his wife Emma lived on the Morley farm for a period of time.

On February 4, 1831, Smith said he had received a revelation calling Edward Partridge to be the first bishop of the church. Five days later, on February 9, 1831, Smith described a second revelation detailing the law of consecration.

Smith said he had received a revelation directing the Latter Day Saints to impart of their land and money to the church. Partridge assigned the incoming saints from New York lots according to another revelation. Smith directed Colesville immigrants to settle in Thompson, Ohio, a few miles east of Kirtland, on a farm owned by Leman Copley. Saints from Seneca County were assigned to the Morley farm.

Partridge attempted to implement the United Order in Thompson; however, disagreements broke out and he was unsuccessful. Shortly after, Smith announced a revelation directing Newel Knight to lead the saints on the Copley farm to settle in Missouri.

Originally, the United Order was intended to be &quot;an everlasting order for the benefit of my church, and for the salvation of men until I come&quot;. In practice, however, the Order was relatively short-lived during Smith&#x27;s life.

== Under Brigham Young ==

From 1855 to 1858, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) once again considered living under the United Order. During this period, under the leadership of Brigham Young, church members were instructed to prepare deeds of consecration, but these deeds were never acted upon perhaps due to the community disruption caused by the Utah War.

It was not until 1874 that Young initiated the United Order of Enoch, beginning in St. George, Utah, on February 9, 1874. There were a number of differences between the United Order of Enoch and United Order communities established years earlier by Joseph Smith. Under Young&#x27;s leadership, producers would generally deed their property to the Order, and all members of the Order would share the cooperative&#x27;s net income, often divided into shares based on the amount of property originally contributed. Sometimes, the members of the Order would receive wages for their work on the communal property.

The cooperative plan was used in at least 200 Mormon communities, most of them in rural areas outlying the central Mormon settlements near the Great Salt Lake. Most of the communities held out for only two or three years before returning to a more standard economic system.

One of the last United Order corporations established the new community of Bunkerville, Nevada, in 1877. In 1880, the Bunkerville cooperative dissolved under pressure from limited water and a lack of individual dedication and initiative.

Like the United Order established by Smith, Young&#x27;s experiment with the United Order was short-lived. By the time of Young&#x27;s death in 1877, most of his United Orders had failed. By the end of the 19th century, the Orders were essentially extinct. Historian Andrew Karl Larson pointed out that the failure of these ventures are rooted in the frailties of human nature:
:The habits of an acquisitive society were too strongly forged to be broken without the utmost devotion and selflessness to the cause, and rugged individualism triumphed over the abortive attempt at communal ownership and communal living here.

Some leaders and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that the United Order will be reestablished some time in the future. Many leaders have taught that the church&#x27;s present system of welfare and humanitarian aid is a predecessor or stepping stone to the renewed practice of the United Order in the future.

=== Kanab ===

Many United Order communities were set up amongst Mormon towns beginning in 1874. One in particular was the United Order of Kanab, which was a settlement initiated by Brigham Young. Kanab was established in 1870. That year, John R. Young and the local bishop, Levi Stewart, began colonizing this area and twelve families followed to begin this endeavor. There was confusion as to who was the leader of this society. LDS Church authorities appointed the bishop and only they could revoke his status. But many wanted to elect John R. Young as president because he was related to LDS Church president Brigham Young. This conflict of power lasted until January 5, 1875, when Levi Stewart became the president. Eventually, Stewart resigned from his position and L. John Nuttall of Provo took his place.

Other families followed that were either unhappy in their own lives or were from other failing colonies. By 1874, there were 81 families and about 17% of the men that lived in this community practiced polygamy. The households were simple in structure and were usually two to three bedrooms. There were about three children per mother in every household and polygamous wives lived in the same home as well. Large families in all Mormon communities were regarded as a spiritual practice and the child to woman ratio in Kanab reflected that.

The main source of income for the community was raising livestock. Most of their wealth was in livestock, vehicles, and shares of stock in corporate enterprises. The land and the improvements made up the remainder of their wealth. This particular United Order was wealthy, but within the society, there were major gaps. Everyone owned property, but some pieces of land were better than others. Eventually, Brigham Young ordered the community to diminish the financial gap that set them apart from the other communities.

Many suffered hardships while living on the frontier and tended to move frequently, around the same area to escape the harsh conditions and seek greater opportunities. It also made it easy to migrate since most of the wealth people had was movable. The number of families moving three or more times was below 50. Only 23 families moved four times or more and 13 moved five times or more.

By 1880, the United Order at Kanab had greatly decreased. Only 32 families remained of the original 81 families that came within the first year of its establishment. Many eventually migrated to Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Mexico. The young men tended to leave home before they were married and started families of their own.

=== &#x27;The Firm&#x27; (Farmington) ===
The longest known surviving Order in the Church was that of the Ezra T. Clark Family, referred to internally as &#x27;The Firm&#x27;. With the permission and blessing of Brigham Young, Clark established the order within his own family at Farmington which lasted from the 1870s until it was dissolved on July 24, 1901, months before the patriarch&#x27;s death. Originally, Clark was chosen as treasurer of the Farmington, Utah Order, but an astute businessman, intimately acquainted with the difficulties of this and other Orders, Clark withdrew, feeling he could establish an Order successfully with his own family comprising 14 boys and four girls from two wives. The Firm&#x27; proved successful in imbuing the all the spiritual principals for which they were devised, in addition to being a commercial success by all measures.

== Property ==
Private property was not abolished and sharing of goods was voluntary under the United Order. Members of the church who chose to participate in the United Order voluntarily deeded their properties to the church, which would then give all or a portion of it back to the original property owner as a stewardship. The &quot;residue,&quot; or property which was over and above what the owner and his family required for themselves, was used by the church to provide to the less fortunate, who would be required to pay it back either monetarily or by labor. The private property owner was not forced to participate in the Order nor was his property forcefully confiscated. Private property owners were free to join or leave the orders and were in control of their stewardship. J. Reuben Clark, a member of the First Presidency, explained:

The fundamental principle of this system was the private ownership of property. Each man owned his portion, or inheritance, or stewardship, with an absolute title, which he could alienate, or hypothecate, or otherwise treat as his own. The church did not own all of the property, and the life under the United Order was not a communal life. ... The United Order is an individualistic system, not a communal system.

Lorenzo Snow, a president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also highlighted the United Order&#x27;s preservation of individual free will:

In things that pertain to celestial glory there can be no forced operations. We must do according as the spirit of the Lord operates upon our understandings and feelings. We cannot be crowded into matters, however great might be the blessing attending such procedure. We cannot be forced into living a celestial law; we must do this ourselves, of our own free will. And whatever we do in regard to the principle of the United Order, we must do it because we desire to do it.

== Relation to Marxist communism ==
This United Order was an attempt to eradicate poverty and promote a sense of unity and brotherhood within Latter Day Saint communities. The LDS Church&#x27;s view is that the doctrine and the various attempts at practicing it should not be seen as part of the 19th-century utopian movement in the United States, and is distinct from both Marxist communism and capitalism.

Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the 20th century sought to make a clear distinction between Marxist communism and the law of consecration as practiced by the United Order, teaching that the practices differed as related to the topics of free will, private property, and deity. The law of consecration and the United Order can be compared to the shared economic arrangement presented in the New Testament as practiced by 1st-century Christians in Jerusalem.
In the 20th century, leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including David O. McKay, Harold B. Lee, Ezra Taft Benson, Marion G. Romney, and J. Reuben Clark, claimed that communism is a &quot;counterfeit&quot; version of the law of consecration. In 1942, the church issued the following statement:

Communism and all other similar isms bear no relationship whatever to the United Order. They are merely the clumsy counterfeits which Satan always devises of the Gospel plan ... The United Order leaves every man free to choose his own religion as his conscience directs. Communism destroys man&#x27;s God-given free agency; the United Order glorifies it. Latter-day Saints cannot be true to their faith and lend aid, encouragement, or sympathy to any of these false philosophies.

Nevertheless, communal unity and equality are central tenets of the Latter Day Saint doctrine of Zion as described in , &quot;And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.&quot;

<doc id="1070052" wikidata="Q1339550" url="?curid=1070052" title="Tenet (band)">
<text>Tenet (stylized in all caps) is a heavy metal band formed as a side project by Jed Simon of Strapping Young Lad and Zimmers Hole.

==Background==
Tenet was formed by Jed Simon in the summer of 1996. Together with Steve Wheeler (Zimmers Hole drummer at the time), they started getting Simon&#x27;s ideas down to demo-tape form, but while both continued playing with their respective bands, nothing much happened for Tenet apart from some casual jam-sessions, which among others also included musicians like Stu Carruthers (Grip Inc.) Simon had met guitarist Glen Alvelais (ex-Forbidden) in 1997 when Strapping Young Lad was touring with Testament, with whom Alvelais was playing at the time. After becoming friends, Simon asked Alvelais to join Tenet.

After signing a deal with Century Media Records, Simon began working on &quot;Sovereign&quot; with bassist Byron Stroud (Fear Factory, Strapping Young Lad, Zimmers Hole) as well as drummer Adrian Erlandsson (At the Gates, the Haunted, Cradle of Filth, Paradise Lost, Brujeria). After reviewing the fact that not enough attention could be devoted to the project by Erlandsson, due to the large geographical distance and other pending commitments, Simon turned back to his long-time partner Gene Hoglan (Death, Dark Angel, Strapping Young Lad, Testament), to take care of the final drum duties. Tenet was still looking for a vocalist, though after a few auditions, Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza (Legacy/Exodus) was selected for the album. It was mixed by Simon together with Vincent Wojno, and mastered by Andy Sneap.

==&quot;Sovereign&quot; (2009)==
After many years of delays and setbacks, Tenet finally released their debut album &quot;Sovereign&quot; on July 20, 2009, in Europe (August 11, 2009, in the United States).

<doc id="1070053" wikidata="Q193054" url="?curid=1070053" title="Potassium sulfate">
<text>Potassium sulfate (US) or potassium sulphate (UK), also called sulphate of potash (SOP), arcanite, or archaically potash of sulfur, is the inorganic compound with formula K2SO4, a white water-soluble solid. It is commonly used in fertilizers, providing both potassium and sulfur.

==History==
Potassium sulfate (K2SO4) has been known since early in the 14th century. It was studied by Glauber, Boyle, and Tachenius. In the 17th century, it was named &quot;arcanuni&quot; or &quot;sal duplicatum&quot;, as it was a combination of an acid salt with an alkaline salt. It was also known as &quot;vitriolic tartar&quot; and &quot;Glaser&#x27;s salt&quot; or &quot;sal polychrestum Glaseri&quot; after the pharmaceutical chemist Christopher Glaser who prepared it and used medicinally.

Known as &quot;arcanum duplicatum&quot; (&quot;double secret&quot;) or &quot;panacea duplicata&quot; in pre-modern medicine, it was prepared from the residue (&quot;caput mortuum&quot;) left over from the production of aqua fortis (nitric acid, HNO3) from nitre (potassium nitrate, KNO3) and oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid, H2SO4) via Glauber&#x27;s process:
The residue was dissolved in hot water, filtered, and evaporated to a cuticle. It was then left to crystallise. It was used as a diuretic and sudorific.

According to Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopedia&quot;, the recipe was purchased for five hundred thalers by Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. Schroder, the duke&#x27;s physician, wrote wonders of its great uses in hypochondriacal cases, continued and intermitting fevers, stone, scurvy, and more.

==Natural resources==
The mineral form of potassium sulfate, arcanite, is relatively rare. Natural resources of potassium sulfate are minerals abundant in the Stassfurt salt. These are cocrystallizations of potassium sulfate and sulfates of magnesium, calcium, and sodium.

Relevant minerals are:
*Kainite, KMg(SO4)·Cl·3H2O
*Schönite (now known as picromerite), K2SO4·MgSO4·6H2O
*Leonite, K2SO4·MgSO4·4H2O
*Langbeinite, K2Mg2(SO4)3
*Aphthitalite (previously known as glaserite), K3Na(SO4)2
*Polyhalite, K2SO4·MgSO4·2CaSO4·2H2O

The potassium sulfate can be separated from some of these minerals, like kainite, because the corresponding salt is less soluble in water.

Kieserite, MgSO4·H2O, can be combined with a solution of potassium chloride to produce potassium sulfate.

==Production==
Approximately 1.5 million tons were produced in 1985, typically by the reaction of potassium chloride with sulfuric acid, analogous to the Mannheim process for producing sodium sulfate. The process involves intermediate formation of potassium bisulfate, an exothermic reaction that occurs at room temperature:
The second step of the process is endothermic, requiring energy input:

==Structure and properties==
Two crystalline forms are known. Orthorhombic β-K2SO4 is the common form, but it converts to α-K2SO4 above 583 °C. These structures are complex, although the sulfate adopts the typical tetrahedral geometry.
It does not form a hydrate, unlike sodium sulfate. The salt crystallizes as double six-sided pyramids, classified as rhombic. They are transparent, very hard and have a bitter, salty taste. The salt is soluble in water, but insoluble in solutions of potassium hydroxide (sp. gr. 1.35), or in absolute ethanol.

==Uses==
The dominant use of potassium sulfate is as a fertilizer. K2SO4 does not contain chloride, which can be harmful to some crops. Potassium sulfate is preferred for these crops, which include tobacco and some fruits and vegetables. Crops that are less sensitive may still require potassium sulfate for optimal growth if the soil accumulates chloride from irrigation water.

The crude salt is also used occasionally in the manufacture of glass. Potassium sulfate is also used as a flash reducer in artillery propellant charges. It reduces muzzle flash, flareback and blast overpressure.

It is sometimes used as an alternative blast media similar to soda in soda blasting as it is harder and similarly water-soluble.

Potassium sulfate can also be used in pyrotechnics in combination with potassium nitrate to generate a purple flame.

A 5% solution of potassium sulfate was used in the beginning of the 20th century as a topical mosquito repellent.

==Reactions==

===Acidification===
Potassium hydrogen sulfate (also known as potassium bisulfate), KHSO4, is readily produced by reacting K2SO4 with sulfuric acid. It forms rhombic pyramids, which melt at . It dissolves in three parts of water at . The solution behaves much as if its two congeners, K2SO4 and H2SO4, were present side by side of each other uncombined; an excess of ethanol the precipitates normal sulfate (with little bisulfate) with excess acid remaining.

The behavior of the fused dry salt is similar when heated to several hundred degrees; it acts on silicates, titanates, etc., the same way as sulfuric acid that is heated beyond its natural boiling point does. Hence it is frequently used in analytical chemistry as a disintegrating agent. For information about other salts that contain sulfate, see sulfate.

<text>Bethóc ingen Maíl Coluim (also Beatrice) was the elder daughter of Máel Coluim mac Cináeda, King of Scots, and the mother of his successor, Duncan I.

==Biography==
Bethóc was the eldest daughter and heir of Malcolm II of Scotland, who had no known sons. She married Crínán, Abbot of Dunkeld, about 1000. This marriage may have been designed to encourage the Dunkeld&#x27;s clan to remain loyal to Malcolm II.

Together, Bethóc and Crínán had an heir, Donnchad I. Crínán has also been assigned other children, that may have been by Bethóc: Maldred, Lord of Allerdale, married Ealdgyth, daughter of Uhtred the Bold, and ancestor of the Earls of Dunbar; and a daughter (name not known) mother of Moddan, Earl of Caithness. Their heir Duncan, also known as Donnchad, succeeded his grandfather Malcolm II to become King of Alba in 1034.

Bethóc may have had two younger sisters: the woman (named by Hector Boece as Donada) who married Findláech mac Ruaidrí, Mormaer of Moray, and was the mother of Macbeth; and an unnamed woman who according to &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; married Sigurd Hlodvirsson, Earl of Orkney and was the mother of Thorfinn the Mighty. Early writers have asserted that Máel Coluim also designated Donnchad as his successor under the rules of tanistry because there were other possible claimants to the throne.

<text>Fritz Theodor Carl von Below (23 September 1853 – 23 November 1918) was a Prussian general in the German Army during the First World War. He commanded troops during the Battle of the Somme, the Second Battle of the Aisne, and the German spring offensive in 1918.

==Biography==

Born in Danzig (West Prussia), von Below, the son of Prussian Major General Ferdinand Adolf Eduard von Below (1812–1870), attended the Prussian Cadet Corps and was transferred to the 1st Foot Guards (German Empire) on 19 April 1873 as a 2nd Lieutenant due to his excellent achievements as a cadet.

He was appointed to the command of XXI Corps in 1912. In this capacity, he fought along with the 6th Army on the Western Front at the beginning of World War I. His corps was transferred in 1915 to the Eastern Front where it participated in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. Below was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 16 February 1915 for successful campaigns on the Western Front and in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes.

Von Below was elevated to command of the 2nd Army on 4 April 1915. In 1916 the 2nd Army bore the brunt of the Allied attack in the Battle of the Somme. Reinforcements increased the size of the 2nd Army to such an extent that a decision was made to split it. The 1st Army was reformed on 19 July 1916 from the right (northern) wing of the 2nd Army. Below took command of 1st Army and 2nd Army got a new commander &quot;General der Artillerie&quot; Max von Gallwitz, who was also installed as commander of &quot;armeegruppe Gallwitz-Somme&quot; to co-ordinate the actions of both armies. Below was awarded the Oakleaves to the Pour le Mérite (signifying a second award) on 11 August 1916 for his success in operations during the Battle of the Somme.

Von Below was appointed to command the 9th Army in June 1918, still on the Western Front. He had contracted pneumonia and its former commander, &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Johannes von Eben, remained in provisional command.

Fritz von Below died in Weimar on 23 November 1918, shortly after Germany had signed the armistice. He is buried in the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin.

==Family==
Von Below was the cousin of Otto von Below, another German commander during the war. The two generals are often confused. His brother Nikolaus Friedrich Wilhelm Ferdinand (1855–1915) was a Major General of the Prussian Army, another brother was General der Infanterie Ernst von Below (1863–1955)

<doc id="1070063" wikidata="Q7887073" url="?curid=1070063" title="Unit (album)">
<text>Unit is the second studio album by Australian rock band Regurgitator, released in November 1997. Its style is a mixture of 1980s style synthesised pop music and alternative rock, with some hip hop influences. The album debuted and peaked at number 4 on the ARIA Charts. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998, the album won five ARIA Music Awards; including Album of the Year.

In October 1998, the album was re-released as Unit Re-Booted, which included the album&#x27;s five music videos.

In 2012, Regurgitator performed the entire album along with &quot;Tu-Plang&quot; on the Australian RetroTech tour.

The album was re-issued on vinyl by Valve in October 2013.

==Prior to recording==
Regurgitator had just completed their eleventh extensive Australian tour (with The Fauves and Tomorrow People), when they planned to start recording a follow-up to their first album, &quot;Tu-Plang&quot;. This was delayed when the band decided to make their third trip to America to do a tour with bands Helmet and The Melvins. Yeomans said of the tour, &quot;I remember being completely frightened the whole time. They were real hard-arses. Helmet were a little army unit, and their fans were fucking really intense, really aggressive guys. Yeah, really full-on. So maybe it did have an effect.&quot; In 2008, manager Paul Curtis recalled that Yeomans had also stated &quot;thank god Grinspoon came along because they took all the male angst away from our shows&quot;.

==The Dirty Room==
Upon return, the group rented a condemned warehouse in Brisbane&#x27;s Fortitude Valley to write and record &quot;Unit&quot;. They affectionately named this studio &quot;The Dirty Room&quot;. Yeomans said, &quot;Martin did a lot of the set up – Magoo as well – and they put in carpet underlay that they&#x27;d found somewhere that was just filthy. Ergh! It had this real soporific effect as soon as you walked in and you just wanted to fall asleep. One of the funny stories is Rob Cavallo coming in to have a listen to one of the tracks, and he just fell asleep on this piss-stained mattress we had lying on the ground. It was a really dingy vibe.&quot;

== Writing and recording ==

Regurgitator had begun experimenting with drum machines and synthesizers on their first album, &quot;Tu-Plang&quot;. Amongst the gear that Yeomans and Ely were using at the time was the Clavia Nord Lead, the Akai S3000XL, the Farfisa Super Bravo Organ and the newly released Roland MC-303 &quot;Groovebox, which featured on a number of tracks including &quot;Unit&quot; and &quot;Polyester Girl&quot;. Ely stated that the track that ultimately helped the band decide the change in musical direction was the ironically titled &quot;I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff&quot;, which began as a punk rock track with some keyboard but gradually &quot;breaking it down with a more minimal keyboard heavy sound, leaving off most of the distorted guitar attack, and adding a vocoder gave the song something we were excited and terrified by at the same&quot;. Magoo added, &quot;Martin said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go full Ultravox!&quot; We started going, let&#x27;s record the drums without cymbals. Let&#x27;s have the keyboards play the basslines.&quot;

After 6 weeks of recording, the album was completed on 2 August 1997.

==Cover art==
The cover is a large, plain yellow circle centred on a plain silver background. On the outside surface of the jewel CD case is a transparent sticker with the words &quot;REGURGITATOR&quot; and &quot;UNIT&quot; printed in black for identification in stores. This minimalist design, credited to &quot;The Shits&quot; (Quan Yeomans and Janet English) and Ben Ely, won the 1998 ARIA award for best cover art.

&quot;Unit Re-Booted&quot; has very similar cover art, and came in four bright colour variations – lime green, purple, royal blue and peach-orange. On the re-releases, the title text was printed directly onto the paper.

==Legacy==
In October 2010, the album was listed in the top 30 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. In July 2011, the album was voted 10th in Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time.

<doc id="1070071" wikidata="Q1617734" url="?curid=1070071" title="Seduction of the Innocent">
<text>Seduction of the Innocent is a book by German-born American psychiatrist Fredric Wertham, published in 1954, that warned that comic books were a harmful form of popular literature and a serious cause of juvenile delinquency. The book was taken seriously at the time in the United States, and was a minor bestseller that alarmed American parents and galvanized them to campaign for censorship. At the same time, a U.S. Congressional inquiry was launched into the comic book industry. Subsequent to the publication of &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, the Comics Code Authority was established by publishers to self-censor their titles. In the decades since the book&#x27;s publication, Wertham&#x27;s research has been disputed by scholars.

==Overview and arguments==
&quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; cited overt or covert depictions of violence, sex, drug use, and other adult fare within &quot;crime comics&quot; – a term Wertham used to describe not only the popular gangster/murder-oriented titles of the time, but superhero and horror comics as well. The book asserted that reading this material encouraged similar behavior in children.

Comics, especially the crime/horror titles pioneered by EC Comics, were not lacking in gruesome images; Wertham reproduced these extensively, pointing out what he saw as recurring morbid themes such as &quot;injury to the eye&quot;. Many of his other conjectures, particularly about hidden sexual themes (e.g. images of female nudity concealed in drawings or Batman and Robin as gay partners), were met with derision within the comics industry. Wertham&#x27;s claim that Wonder Woman had a bondage subtext was somewhat better documented, as her creator William Moulton Marston had admitted as much; however, Wertham also claimed Wonder Woman&#x27;s strength and independence made her a lesbian. At this time homosexuality was still viewed as a mental disorder by the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;. Wertham also claimed that Superman was both un-American and fascistic.

Wertham critiqued the commercial environment of comic book publishing and retailing, objecting to air rifles and knives advertised alongside violent stories. Wertham sympathized with retailers who did not want to sell horror comics, yet were compelled to by their distributors&#x27; table d&#x27;hôte product line policies.

&quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; was illustrated with comic-book panels offered as evidence, each accompanied by a line of Wertham&#x27;s commentary. The first printing contained a bibliography listing the comic book publishers cited, but fears of lawsuits compelled the publisher to tear the bibliography page from any copies available, so copies with an intact bibliography are rare. Early complete editions of &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; are collected avidly by book and comic book collectors.

Beginning in 1948, Wertham wrote and spoke widely, arguing about the detrimental effects that comics reading had on young people. Consequently, &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; serves as a culminating expression of his sentiments about comics and presents augmented examples and arguments, rather than wholly new material. Wertham&#x27;s concerns were not limited to comics&#x27; impact on boys: He also expressed a concern for the effect of impossibly proportioned female characters on girl readers. Writer A. David Lewis claims that Wertham&#x27;s anxiety over the perceived homosexual subtext of Batman and Robin was aimed at the depiction of family within this context, rather than focused on the moral character of homosexuality itself. Will Brooker also writes in &quot;Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon&quot; that Wertham&#x27;s notorious reading of Batman and Robin as a homosexual couple was not of his own invention, but was suggested to him by homosexual males whom he interviewed.

==Influence==

&quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; caught the attention of US Senator Estes Kefauver. Kefauver had a reputation as a mob hunter, and it was known that the mob had strong connections with the distribution of comics and magazines. He saw Wertham&#x27;s agenda as a tool he could use against the organized crime within the industry. As a platform from where he could spread his message more efficiently, Wertham appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. In testimony before the committee, he compared the comic book industry to Adolf Hitler.

The hearing was broadcast on television, which was quickly becoming a new mass medium, and made other media join in. It made headlines on &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27;s front page. Even if the government didn&#x27;t act beyond the hearing, and Kefauver lost interest in comics after he was selected as a presidential candidate, the public damage was already done. The hearing was in April, and the same summer 15 publishers went out of business. At EC Comics, &quot;Mad&quot; was the only surviving title. 

The committee&#x27;s questioning of their next witness, EC publisher William Gaines, focused on violent scenes of the type Wertham had described. 

At the time, Wertham was also the Court&#x27;s appointed psychiatric expert during the trial of the Brooklyn Thrill Killers, a gang of youths who had brutalized people and killed two men during the summer of 1954. Wertham asserted that the gang leader&#x27;s behaviour had been caused by comic books, and most specifically pornographic ones. The case helped fuel the public outrage against comic books. &quot;Nights of Horror&quot;, an underground fetish series that Wertham had used as evidence during the trial, was banned by the State of New York: the case against that comic eventually went to the Supreme Court, which upheld the ban in 1957. 

Although the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency&#x27;s final report did not blame comics for crime, it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily. Publishers then developed the self-censorship body the Comics Code Authority.

==Criticism==
According to a 2012 study by Carol L. Tilley, Wertham &quot;manipulated, overstated, compromised, and fabricated evidence&quot; in support of the contentions expressed in &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;. He misprojected both the sample size and substance of his research, making it out to be more objective and less anecdotal than it truly was. He generally did not adhere to standards worthy of scientific research, instead using questionable evidence for his argument that comics were a cultural failure.

Wertham used New York City adolescents from troubled backgrounds with previous evidence of behavior disorders as his primary sample population. For instance, he used children at the Lafargue Clinic to argue that comics disturbed young people, but according to a staff member&#x27;s calculation seventy percent of children under the age of sixteen at the clinic had diagnoses of behavior problems. He also used children with more severe psychiatric disorders which required hospitalization at Bellevue Hospital Center, Kings County Hospital Center, or Queens General Hospital.

Statements from Wertham&#x27;s subjects were sometimes altered, combined, or excerpted so as to be misleading. Relevant personal experience was sometimes left unmentioned. For instance, in arguing that the Batman comics condoned homosexuality because of the relationship between Batman and his sidekick Robin, there is evidence Wertham combined two subjects&#x27; statements into one, and did not mention the two subjects had been in a homosexual relationship for years prior. He failed to inform readers that a subject had been recently sodomized. Despite subjects specifically noting a preference for or the superior relevance of other comics, he gave greater weight to their reading Batman. Wertham also presented as firsthand stories that he could have only heard through colleagues.

His descriptions of comic content were sometimes misleading, either by exaggeration or elision. He mentions a &quot;headless man&quot; in an issue of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; while the comic only shows Captain Marvel&#x27;s face splashed with an invisibility potion, not a decapitated figure. He exaggerated a 13-year-old girl&#x27;s report of stealing in a comic from &quot;sometimes&quot; to &quot;often&quot;. He compared the Blue Beetle to a Kafkaesque nightmare, failing to mention that the Blue Beetle is a man and not an insect.

==In other countries==
While it had been the US comic industry itself that imposed self-censorship in the form of the Comics Code Authority, France had already passed the Loi du 16 juillet 1949 sur les publications destinées à la jeunesse (Law of July 16, 1949 on Publications Aimed at Youth) in response to the post-liberation influx of American comics. As late as 1969, the law was invoked to prohibit the comic magazine &quot;Fantask&quot; —which featured translated versions of Marvel Comics stories — after seven issues. The government agency charged with upholding the law, particularly in the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, was called the Commission de surveillance et de contrôle des publications destinées à l&#x27;enfance et à l&#x27;adolescence (Committee in Charge of Surveillance and Control over Publications Aimed at Children and Adolescents). After the May 1968 social upheaval in France, key comics artists, including Jean Giraud, staged a revolt in the editorial offices of the comic magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;, demanding and ultimately receiving more creative freedom from editor-in-chief René Goscinny.

West Germany from 1954 had the Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons), a government agency intended to weed out publications, including comics, considered unhealthy for German youth. This agency came about because of the &quot;Gesetz über die Verbreitung jugendgefährdender Schriften&quot; law passed on June 9, 1953, itself resulting from the &quot;provisions for the protection of young persons&quot; clause in Article 5 of the German constitution, regulating freedom of expression. The German comics industry in 1955 instituted the Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle für Serienbilder (Voluntary Self-Control for Comics).

Dutch Minister of Education Theo Rutten of the Catholic People&#x27;s Party published a letter in the October 25, 1948, issue of the newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot; directly addressing educational institutions and local government bodies, advocating the prohibition of comics. He stated, &quot;These booklets, which contain a series of illustrations with accompanying text, are generally sensational in character, without any other value. It is not possible to act against the printers, publishers or distributors of these novels, nor can anything be achieved by not making paper available to them, as the necessary paper is available on the free market&quot;. Exceptions were made for a small number of &quot;healthy&quot; comic productions from the Toonder studio, which included the literary comic strip &quot;Tom Poes&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Comics publisher Dynamite Entertainment (&quot;The Lone Ranger, The Shadow, Conan&quot;) would adopt the title for a series of crime comics, beginning in 2015.

Max Allan Collins crime novel, &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; (June 2013), the third book in his Jack &amp; Maggie Starr series, is a murder mystery set around a fictionalized version of Fredric Wertham&#x27;s crusade against comic books.

<text>Arona (; ; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; on Lake Maggiore, in the province of Novara (northern Italy). Its main economic activity is tourism, especially from Milan, France and Germany.

==History==
Archaeological findings have shown that the area of what today is Arona was settled from the 18th–13th centuries BC. Prehistoric pile-dwellings have been found near the town and are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps UNESCO World Heritage Site. Later it was a possession of the Celts, the Romans and the Lombards. 

In the era of the Roman Empire, Arona became an essential waypoint of the Simplon route, used by the Roman army&#x27;s for the conquest of Gaul region. This historical importance is reflected in the artifacts discovered from a Roman necropolis, including urns, terracotta pots, and coins, which are currently exhibited in the city museum in Piazza San Graziano.

In the 11th century the Benedictine abbey of Saints Gratianus and Felinus, Martyrs, was founded.

After the siege and destruction of Milan in 1162 by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, many of the exiled took refuge in Arona.

Later the town was a possession of the Torriani and (from 1277) of the Visconti families. Under the Visconti family Arona was transformed into a fortified stronghold. They also granted the territory to the wealthy Borromeo family, who were affluent bankers. This small village was given a castle and a well-defended harbor. In the early 14th century, the town became a free commune under the suzerainty of the abbey. In 1439 it was acquired by Vitaliano Borromeo and, as a result, the House of Borromeo. In 1538 Carlo Borromeo was born in the Castle on the Rock of Arona, becoming one of the town&#x27;s most significant figure. 

It was in Arona that the twenty-year-old Oscar Wilde wrote his poem &quot;Rome Unvisited&quot; in 1875, travelling with his former Trinity College Dublin Classics Tutor, J.P. Mahaffy, lamenting that he had to leave Italy before having a chance to visit Rome.

==Geography==
The city of Arona is located on the Piedmontese shore of Lake Maggiore and is crossed by the Vevera stream, which flows into the lake. Around there are the hilly bas-reliefs of morainic origin incorporated into the Lagoni di Mercurago Natural Park where, in 1860, the first pile-dwelling settlement found in Italy was identified. The hills are generally covered by woods that occupy more than half of the territory. 33% of the surface is occupied by urbanized areas, 9% by meadows or pastures; smaller percentages are allocated to parks, gardens and green sports areas (2.3%), vegetable gardens, orchards, nurseries and vineyards (1.7%), uncultivated herbaceous (1%) and arable land (0.4%).

==Main sights==
Arona&#x27;s main attractions include:

*&quot;Sancarlone&quot;. This giant statue of Saint Charles Borromeo was commissioned by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, and construction began in 1614, completed in 1698. At it was the largest bronze standing statue in the world, still second only to the Statue of Liberty. It is said that the architects behind the Statue of Liberty consulted the blueprints of the Sancarlone when laying out their own. The statue was intended as part of a complex of buildings and chapels celebrating the life of St. Charles, of which only three chapels were completed. Next to the statue are the 17th-century basilica and the former Archbishop&#x27;s Palace. A smaller version of the statue, the &quot;Sancarlino&quot;, can be seen in Corso Cavour in the town.
*&quot;La Rocca&quot; (&quot;The Castle&quot;) is a park owned by the Borromeo family. The park used to contain the castle of Arona, destroyed by the Napoleonic armies, and was the birthplace of St. Charles Borromeo himself. The park is freely open to the public and is a favourite of many locals; many animals are kept in semi-captivity in various areas of the park.
* The &quot;Lungolago&quot; (&quot;Lakeside&quot;) offers a view of the castle on the opposite shore, the Rocca Borromeo di Angera, the lake and the Alps. Swimming in Lake Maggiore is now possible, after years of pollution. A beach has been refurbished by this group close to Piazza del Popolo in the town centre, called &quot;Le rocchette&quot; (&quot;The little rocks&quot;).

*&quot;Collegiata della Natività di Maria Vergine&quot; (1482) - church has paintings of the life of the Virgin Mary by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli, also known as Morazzone, and a &quot;Holy Family&quot; by Gaudenzio Ferrari.
*Santi Martiri
*Sacro Monte di Arona

The &quot;frazione&quot; of Mercurago is home to Lagoni Park, a protected area including a peat-bog, pastures dedicated to the breeding of thoroughbred horses and a woodland area. There are also some archaeological findings from the Bronze Age, including ancient wheels.

==Transport==
Arona is north of Milan&#x27;s Malpensa International Airport, actually closer than Milan itself. It is also connected to the railway network, being one of the main stops in the important link between Milan and Switzerland that passes Domodossola (another parallel link travels through Como). Arona is also the last station for two minor rail lines, connecting Arona to Novara and to Santhià; the latter uses single-car diesel trains.

Due to the town&#x27;s size, there is no public transport, but some bus companies connect the town to its &quot;frazioni&quot; of Dagnente, Campagna, Mercurago and Montrigiasco, and to neighbouring municipalities.

Arona is near a confluence of motorways, and from there one can head for Milan, Genoa, and Gravellona Toce (where the motorway becomes a simple highway to Domodossola and continues into Switzerland). Whereas there is a motorway exit named after Arona, the exit at Castelletto Ticino is usually more convenient for the traveller coming from the direction of Milan.

The headquarters of &quot;Navigazione Lago Maggiore&quot; (Lake Maggiore&#x27;s ferry company) is located in Arona, along with its shipyard. Arona is the southernmost port on Lake Maggiore, and transport by boat or hydrofoil is available to both sides of the lake up to the Swiss city of Locarno.

<text>Vraclav () is a municipality and village in Ústí nad Orlicí District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 800 inhabitants.

==Administrative division==
Vraclav consists of three municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Vraclav (547)
*Sedlec (147)
*Svatý Mikuláš (62)

==Etymology==
The initial name of the village was Vratislav, derived from the same personal name. From the 16th century, the shortened form Vraclav appeared.

==Geography==
Vraclav is located about west of Ústí nad Orlicí and southeast of Pardubice. It lies in the Svitavy Uplands. The highest point is the Kamenec hill at above sea level. The Loučná River flows along the northern municipal border.

==History==
A gord was established here in the mid-11th century. The first written mention of Vraclav is from 1073.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The I/17 road (which is here shortly a part of the European route E442) passes through the northern part of the municipality.

==Sights==

The main sight is the Baroque complex of the former pilgrimage Church of Saint Nicholas. In 1711, a spa was established here, near a spring of water that was considered curative. A local chapel was replaced by the church in 1724–1726. The spa and the pilgrimage site almost disappeared in the first half of the 19th century. The complex was reconstructed in 1976–1986. In the former church there is an exposition administered by Vysoké Mýto Regional Museum.

==Notable people==
*Jiří Paďour (1943–2015), Roman Catholic bishop

<doc id="1070082" wikidata="Q1399392" url="?curid=1070082" title="Richard Adler">
<text>Richard Adler (August 3, 1921 – June 21, 2012) was an American lyricist, writer, composer and producer of several Broadway shows. He is best known for his work with Jerry Ross on the musicals &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1954) and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1955).

==Life and career==
Adler was born in New York City, the son of Elsa Adrienne (née Richard) and Clarence Adler. His mother was a debutante from Mobile, Alabama. Adler had a musical upbringing, his father being a renowned Jewish concert pianist, as well as teacher of such composers as Aaron Copland. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1943 and served in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II. After his Navy service he began his career as a lyricist, teaming up with Jerry Ross in 1950. As a duo they worked in tandem, both taking credit for lyrics and music.

===Adler and Ross years (1950–1955)===
After establishing their partnership, Adler and Ross quickly became protégés of composer, lyricist and publisher Frank Loesser. Their first notable composition was the song &quot;Rags to Riches&quot;, which was recorded by Tony Bennett and reached number 1 on the charts in late 1953.

At the same time Bennett&#x27;s recording was topping the charts, Adler and Ross began their career in Broadway theater with &quot;John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, a revue for which they provided most of the songs.

Adler and Ross&#x27;s second Broadway effort, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, opened in May 1954 and was a popular as well as a critical success, winning Tony Awards as well as the Donaldson Award and the Variety Drama Critics Award. Three songs from the show were covered by popular artists and made the upper reaches of the US Hit Parade: Patti Page&#x27;s version of &quot;Steam Heat&quot; reached No. 9; Archie Bleyer took &quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot; to No. 2; and Rosemary Clooney&#x27;s recording of &quot;Hey There&quot; made it to No. 1.

Opening almost exactly a year later, their next vehicle, &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; replicated the awards and success of the earlier show. Cross-over hits from the show were &quot;Heart&quot;, recorded by Eddie Fisher, and &quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot;, by Sarah Vaughan.

The duo had authored the music and lyrics for three great Broadway successes in three years, and had seen over a half-dozen of their songs reach the US top ten, two of them peaking at No. 1. However, their partnership was cut short when Ross died of leukemia in November 1955, aged 29.

Ross is believed to have died from complications related to the lung disease bronchiectasis.

===Later work===
Adler continued to write both alone and with other partners, and composed a major 1958 hit in collaboration with Robert Allen: &quot;Everybody Loves a Lover&quot;, as recorded by Doris Day. However, after 1955 Adler had no further successes on Broadway either as a composer or a producer, although revivals of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; have proved popular. The 1973 revival of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; included one new Adler song, which was retained for the 2006 revival.

His later musicals included &quot;Kwamina&quot;, which he wrote for his then-wife, Sally Ann Howes, who starred in the show opposite Terry Carter. The musical centered around an interracial love story and was too controversial in a time when civil rights were hotly contested. It has not had a Broadway revival.

Adler wrote the musical &quot;Olympus 7-0000&quot; for the show ABC Stage 67. His last original Broadway musical was 1976&#x27;s &quot;Music Is&quot; (lyrics by Will Holt, music by Adler), based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

In 2000, Debelah Morgan based her song &quot;Dance With Me&quot; on a sample of the Adler &amp; Ross song &quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot; from &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. Adler &amp; Ross consequently received co-composer credits on the track, which reached No. 8 on the US Billboard charts—and made Adler the unlikely 79-year-old co-composer of a 21st-century popular R&amp;B hit.

In 2001, some Adler &amp; Ross songs originally written for &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; were featured in the Broadway musical &quot;Fosse&quot;, about the work of Bob Fosse.

He also composed several symphonic and ballet pieces, including one to celebrate the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s centennial.

Adler staged and produced several shows for U.S. presidents; the most notable of these was a 1962 Madison Square Garden birthday celebration for John F. Kennedy that included Marilyn Monroe singing a version of Happy Birthday to the president in her trademark breathy voice.

He is a member of the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Adler was married three times. His second marriage was to English actress Sally Ann Howes in 1958. She adopted his two sons, Andrew and Broadway lyricist Christopher, after the death of his first wife in 1964. Howes appeared in her husband&#x27;s TV musical &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot;, based on the O. Henry short story of that name, and starred in his Broadway musical &quot;Kwamina&quot;. They divorced in 1966. Christopher died of AIDS-related cancer in 1984 at age 30. 

Richard was a Democrat and, along with Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman John Bailey, Lena Horne, Carol Lawrence, Sidney Salomon, Vice-Chairwoman of the DNC Margaret B. Price, and Secretary of the DNC Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, visited John F. Kennedy at The White House on November 20, 1963, two days prior to his assassination.

==Death==
Adler died on June 21, 2012, at his home in Southampton, New York, at age 90. He was survived by his third wife, Susan A. Ivory; his son, Andrew; his daughter, Katherine; and his stepson, Charlie Shipman.

<doc id="1070084" wikidata="Q371957" url="?curid=1070084" title="Jean Dieudonné">
<text>Jean Alexandre Eugène Dieudonné (; 1 July 1906 – 29 November 1992) was a French mathematician, notable for research in abstract algebra, algebraic geometry, and functional analysis, for close involvement with the Nicolas Bourbaki pseudonymous group and the &quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot; project of Alexander Grothendieck, and as a historian of mathematics, particularly in the fields of functional analysis and algebraic topology. His work on the classical groups (the book &quot;La Géométrie des groupes classiques&quot; was published in 1955), and on formal groups, introducing what now are called Dieudonné modules, had a major effect on those fields.

He was born and brought up in Lille, with a formative stay in England where he was introduced to algebra. In 1924 he was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure, where André Weil was a classmate. He began working in complex analysis. In 1934 he was one of the group of &quot;normaliens&quot; convened by Weil, which would become &#x27;Bourbaki&#x27;.

== Education and teaching ==
He served in the French Army during World War II, and then taught in Clermont-Ferrand until the liberation of France. After holding professorships at the University of São Paulo (1946–47), the University of Nancy (1948–1952) and the University of Michigan (1952–53), he joined the Department of Mathematics at Northwestern University in 1953, before returning to France as a founding member of the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques. He moved to the University of Nice to found the Department of Mathematics in 1964, and retired in 1970. He was elected as a member of the Académie des Sciences in 1968.

== Career ==
Dieudonné drafted much of the Bourbaki series of texts, the many volumes of the EGA algebraic geometry series, and nine volumes of his own Éléments d&#x27;Analyse. The first volume of the &quot;Traité&quot; is a French version of the book &quot;Foundations of Modern Analysis&quot; (1960), which had become a graduate textbook on functional analysis.

He also wrote individual monographs on &quot;Infinitesimal Calculus&quot;, &quot;Linear Algebra and Elementary Geometry&quot;, invariant theory, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and formal groups.

With Laurent Schwartz he supervised the early research of Alexander Grothendieck. Later from 1959 to 1964 he was at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques alongside Grothendieck, and collaborating on the expository work needed to support the project of refounding algebraic geometry on the new basis of schemes.

<doc id="1070086" wikidata="Q1613640" url="?curid=1070086" title="Hermitage Castle">
<text>Hermitage Castle is a semi-ruined castle in the border region of Scotland. It stands in the remote valley of the Hermitage Water, part of Liddesdale in Roxburghshire. It is under the care of Historic Scotland. The castle has a reputation, both from its history and its appearance, as one of the most sinister and atmospheric castles in Scotland.

==History==

===Origins of the name===

It is thought that the name derives from Old French: – guardhouse. The castle was known as &quot;the guardhouse of the bloodiest valley in Britain&quot;, and the &quot;Strength of Liddesdale&quot;.

Hermitage Castle was supposedly built by one Nicholas de Soulis around 1240, in a typical Norman Motte and Bailey pattern. It stayed in his family until approximately 1320 when his descendant, William de Soulis, forfeited it because of suspected witchcraft and the attempted regicide of King Robert I of Scotland. Legend has it that Soulis&#x27;s tenantry, having suffered unbearable depredations, arrested him, and at the nearby Ninestane Rig (a megalithic circle), had him encased in lead sheet and boiled to death. In actuality, he died, a prisoner, in Dumbarton Castle.

===Under the Douglases===

In 1338, the then incumbent, Englishman Sir Ralph de Neville was besieged by Sir William Douglas, The Knight of Liddesdale, known as the &quot;Flower of Chivalry&quot; (this sobriquet had to do with his abilities as a knight, although it is often misinterpreted by people with a rather romantic view of history). It was here that Douglas imprisoned and starved to death Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie. his competitor for royal favour.
After the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross and Liddesdale&#x27;s capture by the English, the castle fell into the hands of the English for a time and was given to the care of William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre. Upon Liddesdale&#x27;s death, brought about by a near kinsman, William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, the castle was given to the then baron but later 1st Earl of Douglas. He enabled the construction of most of the present building, possibly with the help of John Lewin, master mason at Durham Cathedral. The castle remained in the hands of the Black Douglases until 1455. The Black Douglas line had so incensed the King that James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas was forfeited, never to return to Scotland, and the beneficences that they had enjoyed passed to the Red Douglas line, including Hermitage Castle.

===Under the Hepburns===

King James IV was suspicious of the then Earl of Angus, Archibald, Bell the Cat and his relationship with Henry VII of England, and ordered him to relinquish The Hermitage to the Crown. On 6 March 1492 Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell had a charter of the lands and lordship of Liddesdale, including The Hermitage Castle, etc., upon the resignation of the same by Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus, the latter getting the lordship of Bothwell (but not the Earldom) which Patrick in turn had resigned for the exchange. The Hepburns of Bothwell, then rising in favour with the king, became keepers and lords of The Hermitage.

In time, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, held the castle. Mary, Queen of Scots, made a famous marathon journey on horseback from Jedburgh to visit the wounded Bothwell there, only a few weeks after the birth of her son. Bothwell had been injured by John Elliot of Park. He had captured Elliot with other border reivers, and brought him to the Hermitage. Elliot tried to escape and Bothwell shot him with his pistol. The wounded man managed to injure Bothwell with a two-handed sword.

Mary and Bothwell were to marry shortly after the murder of her 2nd husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, regardless of the fact that Bothwell was implicated amongst the conspirators. After Mary&#x27;s forced abdication following the confrontation at Carberry Hill, Bothwell, facing charges of treason, fled to Norway and his titles and estates were forfeited by Act of Parliament. Whilst attempting to raise an army to restore Mary to the throne, he was arrested by King Frederik&#x27;s men for breach of marriage contract with Anna Throndsen, and imprisoned at Dragsholm Castle in Denmark, where he died insane and in appalling conditions. His mummified body could at one time be seen at nearby Fårevejle Church.

Thomas Kerr of Ferniehirst was made keeper of Liddesdale and Hermitage Castle in 1584. Bothwell&#x27;s nephew, Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell received a new creation as Earl of Bothwell, and was made Keeper of the castle. As a grandson of James V, albeit through an illegitimate line, he was viewed by some as a potential replacement for James VI. In 1591, Bothwell was arrested, tried, gaoled and forfeited for his supposed involvement with the infamous North Berwick Witches. He obtained a pardon in 1593 but again became involved in intrigue and he was again attainted, by Act of Parliament, on 21 July 1593. The Hermitage once again reverted to the Crown.

===Under the Scotts===

The following year, James granted the castle to Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch (&quot;the bold Buccleuch&quot;), a notorious Border reiver, Warden of the western marches, Keeper of Liddesdale, and leader of the daring and infamous attack on Carlisle Castle to rescue Willie Armstrong of Kinmont.

===Decline===

The castle became obsolete after the Union of the Crowns, in 1603 and fell into disrepair; by the turn of the eighteenth century it was a ruin. Hermitage gave its name to the Viscountcy of Hermitage, conferred in 1706 on Henry, third son of the first Duke of Buccleuch as a subsidiary title of the Earldom of Deloraine. This title became extinct in 1807. Some repairs to the castle were carried out in 1820 by the fifth Duke of Buccleuch. The Scotts are descended matrilinearly from the Douglases of Drumlanrig, a cadet branch, and sometimes use the surname Montagu-Douglas-Scott, thus maintaining a continuity with earlier times.

===Today===
The castle remained a property of the Scotts until 1930, when it was handed over to the care of the Nation. It is now cared for by Historic Environment Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government, and is open to visitors from 1 April to 31 October each year. It is closed during the winter season. The castle, together with a series of ancillary features, is protected as a scheduled monument.

== Ghostlore ==
Hermitage Castle is the subject of local ghostlore stories where it is reputed to be haunted by both Redcap Sly, de Soulis&#x27;s familiar spirit, and by Mary, Queen of Scots.

<text>Lola Berthet (born January 3, 1977) is an Argentine actress.

Berthet began acting at a young age, in her hometown of Buenos Aires, eventually becoming a well known telenovela actress in her home country as an adult. She made her first feature film, &quot;Nueces para el amor&quot;, in 2000. As of 2005, she has participated in five movies and produced one, &quot;Perro amarillo&quot; (2003).

Berthet became internationally famous in 2004, when she was chosen to participate in the major hit soap opera &quot;Los Roldán&quot;, alongside Miguel Ángel Rodríguez and Claribel Medina, among others. Her youthful looks (she played Rodríguez&#x27;s teenage daughter), along with her experience as an actress helped her get chosen. &quot;Los Roldán&quot; became a hit in such places as Chile, Russia, and Hungary, making Berthet a well known actress in those countries as well as in the rest of Latin America.

Berthet is contractually attached to one of Argentina&#x27;s main television networks, Telefé.
In the 2007 telenovela, Lalola, she played the role of Soledad. 
In 2013, Berthet is hired by Sebastián Ortega, to form part of Vecinos en Guerra, the new TV series to be aired by the channel Telefe.

<text>The Princess and the Warrior () is a 2000 German romantic drama film written and directed by Tom Tykwer. It follows the life of Sissi (Franka Potente), a psychiatric hospital nurse who, after a near-death experience, enters into a relationship with Bodo (Benno Fürmann), an anguished former soldier who lapses into criminality.

==Plot==
Sissi, a nurse in a psychiatric hospital, receives a letter from her old friend Meike, asking for her help in retrieving a bequest from Meike&#x27;s recently deceased mother. Sissi cares for her patients to the extent that they appear to be her extended family (in fact, she states that her own father is a patient in the hospital). As such, she has little experience of life outside the hospital. Meanwhile, Bodo, living with his brother, applies for a funerary job but is quickly dismissed because of his inability to control his emotions. He later robs a grocery store and during the ensuing chase indirectly causes a truck to hit Sissi. Taking cover from the police underneath the truck, Bodo finds Sissi, who cannot speak or breathe. In order to save her life, he performs an emergency tracheotomy. Once Sissi is in medical care, they are separated without Sissi ever learning his name.

The circumstances of her accident prevent Sissi from re-adjusting to her mundane life at the hospital, as she obsesses about tracking down her saviour. One of her patient friends, who had accompanied her on the day of her accident, helps her do so. She manages to track down Bodo, who is not interested in maintaining contact with her or any other woman. Bodo is seen several times, in a semi-conscious state, embracing a hot stove, having to be restrained by his brother Walter. It later becomes clear that Bodo is hallucinating (or perhaps dreaming) about his deceased wife, having never fully recovered from her death. Walter tells Sissi that Bodo&#x27;s wife was killed in an explosion at a filling station, while Bodo was in the washroom. After Walter finishes his explanation, Bodo arrives and throws Sissi out.

Walter, employed as a security guard at a local bank, involves Bodo in a planned robbery (in preparation for their impending move to Australia together). As they are overpowering the money couriers in the vault, Sissi visits the bank, following Meike&#x27;s instructions. As she enters, she notices that Walter is employed at the bank. The alarm is tripped by one of the couriers and Walter is shot when a security guard comes to investigate. Without thinking about it, Sissi prevents the guard from shooting the brothers and helps them escape. They deliver Walter to an emergency room, where his last words to his brother are &quot;get off the toilet, Bodo&quot; (referring to Bodo&#x27;s inability to move on after his wife&#x27;s death, seeing himself stuck in the gas station&#x27;s restroom). Sissi hides Bodo at the institution, where he suffers a violent breakdown upon learning of his brother&#x27;s death on TV. This incident brings Bodo to the attention of the head doctor at the institution, and he is treated and kept as a patient. It is during this period that Bodo explains to Sissi the true nature of his wife&#x27;s death; a flashback shows Bodo and his wife engaged in a serious argument at the filling station. After heading to the washroom, Bodo witnesses his wife engulfed in a huge explosion caused by her deliberate dropping of a cigarette into a pool of gasoline.

Sissi makes the decision to leave and asks Bodo to come with her, telling him of her dream in which they were &quot;brother and sister, father and mother, husband and wife&quot;. Meanwhile, Steini, one of the patients, who recognized Bodo&#x27;s identity and is jealous of him spending time with Sissi, calls the police and in a delusion tries to kill Bodo by electrocution (by throwing a toaster into Bodo&#x27;s bathtub). The delusion, really a flashback, reveals that Steini had killed Sissi&#x27;s mother the same way. Bodo however catches the toaster out of the air before it can fall into the tub and chases Steini into the attic. Meanwhile, the police arrive, and Sissi realizes that her mother was in fact murdered and did not commit suicide. She follows Steini to the roof, who offers to jump to atone for his actions. She declines, saying &quot;You&#x27;re not going to jump anyway&quot;, grabs Bodo&#x27;s hand, and together they jump from the roof of the building, into a small pond.

The final scene (taking place at the scene of Bodo&#x27;s wife&#x27;s accident) strays into a bit of surrealism: Bodo&#x27;s past personality, unkempt and finally emerging from the gas station restroom, takes a seat behind the wheel, while the real Bodo gets in the back of the car. As they drive off, Sissi touches (old) Bodo&#x27;s face to wipe away his tears, but he stops her and does so himself, pushing her away yet again. This visibly stirs (real) Bodo, who leans forward and covers his former self&#x27;s eyes, forcing him to brake. &quot;Real&quot; Bodo tells &quot;old&quot; Bodo to get out and leaves him standing in the middle of the road thus symbolically taking over &quot;old&quot; Bodo&#x27;s life; perhaps a visual metaphor for beginning anew.

In the international version of the movie, a small scene commences with the abandoned &quot;old&quot; Bodo as a more resolved ending to this surrealistic character and moment. Turning, he notices a sign indicating a bus stop in the field off the road; he waits by it, and an empty bus, driven by Walter, soon arrives to pick up this &quot;dead&quot; version of Bodo. The brothers do not speak, and they drive off a short distance before disappearing.

The film ends with Bodo&#x27;s redemption through his acceptance of Sissi, as he is shown at last content and dry-eyed as the couple arrive at Meike&#x27;s seaside house on the edge of a cliff.

<doc id="1070098" wikidata="Q1393234" url="?curid=1070098" title="Lion head symbol of Singapore">
<text>The lion head symbol was introduced in 1986 as an alternative national symbol of Singapore. The lion head was chosen as a nice logo, as it best captures the characteristics of Singapore&#x27;s reputation as a Lion City. It is used in less formal occasions mainly to promote Singapore&#x27;s national identity.

When it was first unveiled, some sections of the public felt that it should have been facing rightwards to represent a more forward looking nature. However, the original left-facing lion was maintained.

==Origin==
In the 13th-century &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, Sang Nila Utama, a prince from Palembang was shipwrecked and washed ashore to an island. There he saw a creature which he believed was a lion. So he named the island &quot;Singa Pura&quot; which means &quot;Lion City&quot; in Malay, from which the name Singapore was derived.

==Meaning==
According to the Singapore government:
==Guidelines for use==
Extracted from &quot;Guidelines on the use of National Symbols: The Singapore Lion Symbol&quot; (July 1999) published by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts:

# Subject to approval, organisations can use the Singapore Lion Symbol for the purpose of identifying with the nation and with the endeavour to achieve excellence for Singapore.
# In application, the symbol should not be modified in any way. However, the symbol in outline, embossed or portrayed as a watermark, are acceptable forms of depiction. It should preferably face left and be used together with the word &quot;Singapore&quot;.
# The symbol should preferably be in red on a white background or white on a red background. However, it may also appear in gold, silver or in the corporate colours of the user organisation. Users must ensure that the symbol is depicted only in one colour.

<doc id="1070102" wikidata="Q3236818" url="?curid=1070102" title="Henry Fok">
<text>Henry Fok Ying Tung (10 May 1923 – 28 October 2006) was an entrepreneur and politician in Hong Kong. From 1993 until his death, Fok served as Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference. He was one of the Hong Kong&#x27;s wealthiest persons.

==Biography==
Fok was born on 10 May 1923 in Hong Kong to an ethnic Tanka family. Fok&#x27;s father died in a boating accident when he was just seven. He studied at Queen&#x27;s College, but was not able to finish junior high due to the Japanese invasion in 1937. He worked as a labourer during that time while helping to run the family&#x27;s small boat business.

===Business===
After the war, he became a successful businessman. His business interests included restaurants, real estate, casinos and petroleum. Fok reportedly made his first fortune gun-running into the mainland during the Korean War in the early 1950s, circumventing a United Nations arms embargo. Fok vigorously denied weapons trafficking, but admits having violated sanctions by smuggling steel and rubber as well as other items.

He was the President of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the President of the Hong Kong Football Association, and the President of the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong. He was also the Chairman of Henry Fok Estates Ltd and the Yau Wing Co of Hong Kong.

In the 1980s Fok organized the effort to bail out OOCL from bankruptcy shortly after its founder Tung Chao-yung died.

Fok developed the Zhongshan Hot Springs Hotel, which had a golf course designed by Arnold Palmer. It was one of the first golf courses built in China since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In 2006, Forbes magazine listed Fok as the seventh wealthiest person in Hong Kong and the 181st in the world, with a fortune of US$3.7 billion.

===Political===
Before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, Henry Fok was a member of the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the vice-chairman of the Preliminary Working Committee of Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, and the vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee of Hong Kong SAR. He was also Standing Committee member of 7th National People&#x27;s Congress.

The press frequently reports that Henry Fok had introduced Tung Chee Hwa to Jiang Zemin as a possible candidate of the first Hong Kong Chief Executive.

Henry Fok helped Tung Chee Hwa out of a near-bankruptcy of his family&#x27;s Orient Overseas Container Line in the 1980s. Because of this relationship, it was often said while Tung was the Chief Executive of Hong Kong that Fok &#x27;intervened/advised&#x27; if times, or rather Beijing, called for it.

===Philanthropy===
Henry Fok founded the Fok Ying Tung Foundation in 1984, and it is now one of the largest philanthropic organisations in Hong Kong. Fok founded a high-technology business park in Nansha District, Guangzhou. He is said to have visited the site more than 500 times, and through the Foundation, pledged HK$800 million (US$100 million) to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2005 to support the initiative.

===Personal===
Fok&#x27;s wife was Elaine Lui (), and he had two concubines, Elaine Fung () and Lam Sook-duen (), according to the &quot;Great Qing Legal Code&quot;, which remained in force for Chinese people in Hong Kong until 1971. Some forms of polygamy remained legal in Hong Kong until it was outlawed in 1971. Among Fok&#x27;s children, the best-known are:
* Timothy Fok Tsun-ting – Hong Kong Football Association chairman and Legislative Council member.
* Ian Fok Chun-wan – managing director, Yau Wing Co. Ltd; Director, Fok Ying Tung Foundation Ltd, a former chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, whose son was convicted of drug possession in 2005.

Fok had family roots in Panyu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong.

===Death===
On 28 October 2006, Fok died at the age of 83 at the Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, where he was being treated for cancer. He had been diagnosed with lymphoma in 1984 and the cancer had reappeared in 2004. His body was flown back to Hong Kong for a traditional funeral in accordance with his wishes. Fok was one of the first Hong Kongers to have his casket draped in the Chinese national flag since the handover (the others being T. K. Ann and Wong Ker-lee). He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Reform Pioneer.

<doc id="1070105" wikidata="Q3246542" url="?curid=1070105" title="Vexilloid">
<text>A vexilloid is any flag-like (vexillary) object used by countries, organisations, or individuals as a form of representation other than flags. American vexillologist Whitney Smith coined the term &quot;vexilloid&quot; in 1958, defining it as

This includes vexilla, banderoles, pennons, streamers, heraldic flags, standards, and gonfalons. Examples include the Sassanid battle standard Derafsh Kaviani, and the standards of the Roman legions such as the eagle of Augustus Caesar&#x27;s Xth legion and the dragon standard of the Sarmatians; the latter was allowed to fly freely in the wind, carried by a horseman, but depictions suggest that it bore more similarity to an elongated dragon kite than to a simple flag.
The use of flags replaced the use of vexilloids for general purposes during late medieval times between about 1100 to about 1400. However, vexilloids still remain in use for specialised purposes, such as for some military units or to symbolise various organisations such as fraternal organisation in street parades.

==History==
Vexilloids originally started as a staff of office for leaders of groups, such as tribes, and were also used as a visible sign to rally around or point to a direction of attack. They were originally made of wood, horns, tails, hooves, and skins of animals, with other ornaments being made of carved and painted wood or metal. Aztec vexilloids were composed of green quetzal feathers, metals such as gold, and precious stones. Modern vexilloids used by tribes of New Guinea are made of wood, dried grass and feathers, and emblems painted on wood, feathers, and cloth.
The oldest known vexilloids appear as depictions on Egyptian pottery from the Gerzeh culture and on the reverse of the Narmer Palette. These vexilloids were symbols of the nomes of pre-dynastic Egypt. The oldest surviving vexilloid was carried in Persia around 5,000 years ago. It consists of a metal staff topped with an eagle, and a square of metal covered with reliefs. Two vexilloids are depicted on the Victory Stele of Naram-Sin. In Alaca Höyük, archaeologists have discovered Hittite vexilloids dating from c.2400–2200 BCE, having finials depicting bulls, stags, as well as abstract forms often interpreted as solar symbols.
Ancient Greek armies used a -like banners, such as the so-called , a cloth of deep red, suspended from the top of a staff or spear. It is not known to have carried any device or decoration though.

Ancient Romans adopted the use of vexilloids, as well as their eagle emblem, from the Persians. The standards of Roman legions consisted of a lance with a silver-plated shaft, topped with a crosspiece carrying figures of various beasts, the most important being the eagle. Attached to the shaft were several metal rings which took the form of laurel wreaths and medallions with images of gods, the Emperor, and members of the Imperial House.

Ancient Mongolians also used vexilloids in the form of a staff topped with a metal ball or spearhead, with a horse&#x27;s tail attached to it. This vexilloid, called a tug, spread among Turkish people and became military symbols in Turkish forces. In the 17th and 18th centuries they were carried before commanders-in-chief of the Polish Army.

==Examples==
===Ancient===
* The Achaemenid Empire used a stylised falcon on its vexilloid.
* The vexilloid of Alexander the Great&#x27;s Macedonian Empire displayed the Vergina Sun.
* The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom has an Elephant as their symbol. 
* The Indo-Greek Kingdom has The Buddhist Triratna as their symbol. 
* The Indo-Scythians has a Lion or a Leopard standing right as their symbol. 
* The vexilloid of The Indo-Parthian Kingdom is likely pretty similar to The Parthian Sun and it is related with The Derafsh Kaviani. 
* The vexilloid of The Kushan Empire is suspended on the point of a Spear or Trident
* The symbol of the Mauryan Empire was the Ashoka Chakra.
* The Gupta Empire has The Garuda as their symbol. 
* The vexilloid of Ancient Carthage most probably consisted of a spear with a disk and crescent (points upwards), symbolising the god Baal (sun = disk) and the goddess Tanit (moon = crescent).
* The Ptolemaic Kingdom has The Eagle of Zeus as their symbol. 
* The vexillum of Ancient Rome displayed the slogan (&quot;senātus populusque Rōmānus&quot;), &quot;The Roman Senate and People&quot;, in gold on a field of crimson.
* The Sassanian Empire, which is called &quot;Eran Shahr&quot; (&quot;Aryan Empire&quot;) in Middle Persian, used lotus symbol on its vexilloid, which is called the Derafsh Kaviani.

===Medieval===
* The tugh of Central Asian and Turkic peoples of the pre-Ottoman and Ottoman periods.
* The vexilloid of the Mongol Empire, the &quot;Yöson Khölt tsagaan tug&quot; () or the &quot;Nine Base White Banners&quot;, was composed of nine flag poles decorated with nine off-white horse tail hairs hanging from a round surface with a flame or trident-like shape on the top at the centre. The Nine White Banners was a peacetime emblem used by the Khan in front of his yurt. The war flag of the Mongol Empire was the same as the banner at right, except the horse tails were off-black instead of off-white as they were cut from black instead of white horses. 
* Heraldic flags are forms of vexilloids with designs based on heraldry, a famous example being the Oriflamme of France.
* The Chola empire had the tiger as their symbol and flag.
===Modern===
* The French Imperial Eagle was a figure of an eagle on a staff carried into battle by the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; of Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars.
* In Nazi Germany, also referred to as the Third Reich, the SS used vexilloids which they marched with in street parades and at the Nuremberg rallies. These vexilloids were topped with an eagle and a swastika and with the name of the particular locale of the SS contingent carrying the vexilloids. Inscribed on them was the slogan &quot;Deutschland Erwache&quot;, which means &quot;Germany Awake&quot;.
* Individuals create festival totems of various designs on top of extendable staffs to identify themselves in disorienting crowds at music festivals.

<text>Harry James Duynhoven (born 1955) is a New Zealand politician and member of the New Zealand Labour Party. He was the mayor of the city of New Plymouth and surrounding districts from 2010–2013. He was a Member of Parliament for the New Plymouth electorate from 1987–1990, from 1993–2003, and again from 2003–2008.

Duynhoven was elected as Mayor of New Plymouth in October 2010 but was defeated after serving a single term. He was elected as a councillor for the city ward of the New Plymouth District Council in a by-election, and was re-elected to that role and elected as a board member on Taranaki&#x27;s district health board in 2016 and 2019.

==Early life==
Duynhoven was born in New Plymouth on 22 June 1955.
He left Spotswood College at age sixteen to become an electrician, and eventually became a technical teacher at the collegiate and polytechnic level.

==Member of Parliament==



Duynhoven entered Parliament in the 1987 election, winning the New Plymouth seat from incumbent National Party MP, Tony Friedlander. In the 1990 election, he lost the seat to National&#x27;s John Armstrong, but won it back in the 1993 election. In the 2008 election he lost to New Zealand National Party candidate, Jonathan Young by 105 votes, the smallest margin in the election.

In 2003, Duynhoven raised with the Speaker of Parliament his status, and whether he might have breached electoral law, thus disqualifying him from retaining his seat. The Speaker was responsible for determining whether a vacancy existed. This matter arose after Duynhoven applied to resume his citizenship of the Netherlands. His father was from the Netherlands, and Duynhoven had possessed citizenship from birth, but had temporarily lost it due to a change of Dutch law. According to electoral law, applying for foreign citizenship would disqualify Duynhoven from retaining his seat. The Speaker ruled on 23 July 2003 that Parliament&#x27;s Privileges Committee, who were until 2002 responsible for determining whether a vacancy exists, would consider the matter, and that he would be guided by their report. The Solicitor General advised the Privileges Committee that the law was clear, and that Duynhoven&#x27;s seat became vacant on 11 June 2003. The majority decision of the Privileges Committee was that Duynhoven was disqualified from holding his seat, and that it had accordingly been vacated. However the government introduced an act retroactively amending the law, to allow Duynhoven to resume his seat.

Duynhoven served as a Minister outside Cabinet of Helen Clark&#x27;s Labour Government with the portfolio of Associate Minister of Transport, and later, Minister for Transport Safety and Associate Minister of Energy until his government&#x27;s defeat. He did not stand as a party list candidate in the 2008 general election.

In 1990, Duynhoven was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order in the 2012 New Year Honours, for services as a Member of Parliament.

== Local government politics ==
In October 2010, Duynhoven was elected Mayor of New Plymouth. Three years later, on 12 October 2013, Mr Duynhoven became the first New Plymouth mayor since Edward Hill in 1956 to be ousted after one term.&quot; He attributed his defeat at that election to being overshadowed by maverick councillor John McLeod.

McLeod, along with fellow councillor Len Houwers, resigned in late 2014. On 11 January 2015, Duynhoven confirmed months of speculation that he would stand in the by-election to fill the vacancies. Duynhoven said his decision to stand in the by-election came after receiving &quot;a huge number of phone calls and visits from people asking me to stand.&quot; Duynhoven was one of the two successful candidates. He was re-elected in the 2016 local elections and the 2019 local elections. In both of those elections, he was also elected to the Taranaki District Health Board.

<doc id="1070118" wikidata="Q1061035" url="?curid=1070118" title="The Treachery of Images">
<text>The Treachery of Images () is a 1929 painting by Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte. It is also known as This Is Not a Pipe, Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe and The Wind and the Song. It is on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

The painting shows an image of a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted, &quot;&quot; (, French for &quot;This is not a pipe&quot;.)
The theme of pipes with the text &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe&quot; is extended in &quot;Les Mots et Les Images&quot;, &quot;La Clé des Songes&quot;, &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe (L&#x27;air et la chanson)&quot;, &quot;The Tune and Also the Words&quot;, &quot;Ceci n’est pas une pomme&quot;, and &quot;Les Deux Mystères&quot;.

The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message like the Alfred Korzybski&#x27;s &quot;The word is not the thing&quot; and &quot;The map is not the territory&quot;, as well as Denis Diderot&#x27;s &quot;This is not a story&quot;.

On December 15, 1929, Paul Éluard and André Breton published an essay about poetry in &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot; (The Surrealist Revolution) as a reaction to the publication by poet Paul Valéry &quot;Notes sur la poésie&quot; in &quot;Les Nouvelles littéraires&quot; of September 28, 1929. When Valéry wrote &quot;Poetry is a survival&quot;, Breton and Éluard made fun of it and wrote &quot;Poetry is a pipe&quot;, as a reference to Magritte&#x27;s painting.

In the same edition of &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot;, Magritte published &quot;Les mots et les images&quot; (his founding text which illustrated where words play with images), his answer to the survey on love, and &quot;Je ne vois pas la [femme] cachée dans la forêt&quot;, a painting tableau surrounded by photos of sixteen surrealists with their eyes closed, including Magritte himself.

<doc id="1070120" wikidata="Q2321393" url="?curid=1070120" title="Westerham">
<text>Westerham is a town and civil parish in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It is located 3.4 miles east of Oxted and 6 miles west of Sevenoaks, adjacent to the Kent border with both Greater London and Surrey.
It is recorded as early as the 9th century, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 in a Norman form, &quot;Oistreham&quot; (compare Ouistreham in Normandy, &quot;Oistreham&quot; in 1086). &quot;Hām&quot; is Old English for a village or homestead, and so Westerham means a &quot;westerly homestead&quot;. The River Darent flows through the town, and formerly powered three watermills. The total population in 2021 was 4,498.

==History==


There is evidence that the area around Westerham has been settled for thousands of years: finds such as a Celtic fortification (c 2000 BC) and a Roman road are close by, along with the remains of a Roman encampment just past the ruins of a tower south of the town at the summit of Tower Woods.

The tower dates back to the 18th century, and was originally constructed by the owners of Squerryes Court as a folly for their children&#x27;s amusement.

The manor was originally run by Godwin, Earl of Wessex and later by his son Harold Godwinson the last Saxon King of England. The first Norman lord of Westerham was Eustace II of Boulogne, and the town appears in the Domesday Book as Oistreham. By 1227 Henry III granted Westerham a market charter, making the new village a major player in the buying and selling of cattle in Kent, a tradition that survived to 1961 when the last cattle market was held. St Mary&#x27;s Church is thought to date from the 13th century, although it was much altered in Victorian times. In 1503 the Protestant martyr John Frith was born in the town.

The church is unusual in that it displays the only known representation of a royal arms of King Edward VI (reigned 1547–1553) in a church. There is little doubt that it is the king&#x27;s arms as the supporters are a lion and a dragon, and there is a curious Latin phrase beside the arms: &quot;VIVAT REX CURAT LEX&quot; (Long live the King, custodian of the law). England did not have another male monarch until the Union of the Crowns in 1603.

In 1596, there was a peculiar subsidence of a hill measuring 80 by 28 perches, which was transformed into a dale.

James Wolfe was born in the town in 1727 at what is now known as the Old Vicarage due to a terrible storm on the night he was born. He lived in Quebec House—many streets and buildings are named after him and St Mary&#x27;s contains not only the font in which he was baptised but also a memorial window to him by Edward Burne-Jones. The town square contains statues to both Wolfe and Churchill.

Interior and exterior scenes for the 2009 BBC mini-series Emma were shot at Squerryes Court with the house appearing as Emma Woodhouse&#x27;s home Hartfield, while exterior scenes were shot at Chilham, Kent.

Alice Liddell, cited as the inspiration for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s children&#x27;s book Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland lived in the Vicarage for a brief period. Alice rented &#x27;The Breaches&#x27; just before she died and then when she became very ill she went to stay with her sister Rhoda at Hoseyrigge in Westerham. She was born at Westminster and when she died aged 82 a memorial service was held for her at St Mary&#x27;s Church. She was not buried in Westerham. Record producer Brian Higgins, whose Xenomania production team produced hit singles and albums for artists such as Girls Aloud, Kylie Minogue, Sugababes, Pet Shop Boys, Texas and Franz Ferdinand, now occupy what used to be known as the Old Vicarage.

BBC Children&#x27;s TV founders Freda Lingstrom and Maria Bird lived together in Westerham and named their production company Westerham Arts which was commissioned by the BBC to create The Woodentops, Andy Pandy and the Flower Pot Men.

During a January 1967 visit to Knole Park in Sevenoaks to shoot a promotional film for Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane, John Lennon stopped at a Westerham antiques shop and purchased a poster for Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus Royal, which later inspired the song, &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;

As well as the parish church (a Grade II*-listed building), there is a Grade II-listed chapel associated with the Congregational Federation and a Roman Catholic church. Westerham Evangelical Congregational Church dates from 1839 and St John the Baptist&#x27;s Catholic Parish Church opened in 1955.

==Economy==

Westerham was home to the Black Eagle Brewery, which was taken over by Taylor Walker &amp; Co in the 1950s, becoming part of Ind Coope in 1959 and closing in 1965. Yeast from the brewery was preserved at the National Collection of Yeast Cultures and is now used by the present day Westerham Brewery which was established in 2004.

Westerham was home to Crayford Engineering, a successful car conversion company, from 1962 to the 1980s, working from a workshop at Squerryes Mede.

==Chartwell==


In 1922 Winston Churchill MP purchased Chartwell Manor on the outskirts of Westerham, which, apart from the time he spent at 10 Downing Street and 28 Hyde Park Gate (his London home), was his home for the rest of his life. Chartwell is now administered by the National Trust.

There is a statue of Sir Winston Churchill on the village green at Westerham. It was sculpted by Oscar Nemon and stands on a base of Yugoslavian stone, the gift of Marshal Josip Broz Tito.

==Local sports clubs==
Westerham Cricket Club was founded in 1831, folded in 2004 and reformed in 2019. Previous home grounds: 1831 to 1874 Farley Common, Westerham; 1875 to 1987 Squerryes Park, Westerham; 1988 to 2004 Costell&#x27;s Meadow, Westerham. In 1990, the cricket club invited the football, rugby and netball clubs to join them in forming the Westerham Sports Association (WSA) which secured a grant to build a new clubhouse which opened in 1990 and still exists. The Cricket Club now plays its home matches at Valence Park, a picturesque cricket ground on the outskirts of Westerham. 

Sir Winston Churchill Boxing club located at the Royal Standard Public House.

Westerham is also home to a football team, Westerham Football Club, which was founded in 1888. Westerham Junior Football Club provide football for 5-18 year olds playing in the Tandridge and Crowborough leagues. Both clubs are located at King George V Playing Field.

Westerham has two ladies netball teams that compete in the Tunbridge Wells League. Westerham also hosts a weekly parkrun on part of the Squerryes Estate.

<text>In computer hardware terminology, slotkets, also known as slockets, (both short for &quot;slot to socket adapter&quot;) are adapters that allow socket-based microprocessors to be used on slot-based motherboards.

Slotkets were first created to allow the use of Socket 8 Pentium Pro processors on Slot 1 motherboards. However, only a few number of chipsets supported these slotkets, and so did not see widespread use. Later, they became more popular for inserting Socket 370 Intel Celerons into Slot 1 based motherboards. This lowered costs for computer builders, especially with dual processor machines. High-end motherboards accepting two Slot 1 processors (usually Pentium 2) were widely available, but double-socketed motherboards for the less expensive Socket 370 Celerons were not (with a few exceptions). The slotkets remained popular in the transition period from Slot to Socket-based Pentium III processors by allowing CPU upgrades in existing Slot 1 motherboards.

Slotkets were never introduced to take advantage of the AMD Athlon processors&#x27; transition from the Slot A form factor to the Socket A form factor. Additionally, adapters that go the other way around (from socket-based motherboards to slot-based CPUs) were also never introduced, especially since Socket 8 based motherboards do not support the higher clock frequencies of Slot 1 based processors.

Today, slotkets have largely disappeared, as Intel and AMD have not manufactured CPUs in slot form factors since 1999.

<text>Persian lime (Citrus × latifolia), also known by other common names such as seedless lime, Bearss lime and Tahiti lime, is a citrus fruit species of hybrid origin, known only in cultivation. The Persian lime is a triploid cross between Key lime (&quot;Citrus × aurantiifolia&quot;) and lemon (&quot;Citrus ×&quot; &quot;limon&quot;).

Although there are other citrus species that are referred to as &quot;limes&quot;, the Persian lime is the most widely cultivated lime species commercially, and accounts for the largest share of the fruits sold as limes. The fruit turns yellow as it ripens, but it is universally sold while still green.

==Description==
The tree is a triploid cross between Key Lime (Citrus _ aurantiifolia) and Lemon (Citrus limon). It is nearly thornless. The fruit is about in diameter, often with slightly nippled ends, and is usually sold while green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is larger, thicker-skinned, with less intense citrus aromatics than the Key lime (&quot;Citrus aurantifolia&quot;). The advantages of the Persian lime in commercial agriculture compared to the key lime are the larger size, absence of seeds, hardiness, absence of thorns on the bushes, and longer fruit shelf life. They are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key lime&#x27;s unique flavor.

==Cultivation==
Persian limes were first grown on a large scale in Persia (now known as Iran) and southern Iraq.

The trees are propagated clonally, by grafting or air layering. Persian limes are commercialized primarily in six sizes, known as 110s, 150s, 175s, 200s, 230s and 250s. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed, and exported every year primarily from Mexico to the American, European and Asian markets. In 2014, Brazil was the major exporter of fresh limes to Europe (about 70%) with Mexico supplying most of the remainder.

=== Cultivars ===

Cultivars include:
* Bearss lime (named after John T. Bearss, who developed this seedless variety about 1895 in his nursery at Porterville, California)
* Page lime
* Persian lime SPB-7
* Pond&#x27;s lime
* Tahiti lime

==Uses==
It is widely available dried, as it is often used this way in Persian cuisine.

<text>&quot;Baa Baa, Black Sheep&quot; is a semi-autobiographical short story by Rudyard Kipling, published in 1888.

The story deals with the unkind treatment that Kipling received between the ages of 6 and 11 in a foster home in Southsea. This subject is also discussed in the novel &quot;The Light That Failed&quot; published in 1890, and occupies most of the first chapter of his autobiography &quot;Something of Myself&quot; published in 1937.

Kipling and his younger sister are named Punch and Judy in this story. Following established custom for English families living in India, the Kipling parents sent their children to stay in England (in this case, in a foster home) for several years. Judy was treated warmly, but Punch was miserably abused and driven to a point of murderous and suicidal desperation. He also became nearly blind at this time.

==Adaptations==
The story has been dramatized on film in the following teleplays:

* In 1960 as &quot;The Black Sheep&quot;, an episode of the TV anthology series &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot;.
* In 1974 as a TV movie &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; directed by Mike Newell, which aired on ITV in the UK and on PBS three years later in the U.S.

In 1993 it was used as the basis of an opera, with a libretto by the Australian novelist David Malouf and music by English composer Michael Berkeley.

<doc id="1070151" wikidata="Q221513" url="?curid=1070151" title="Kurgan hypothesis">
<text>The Kurgan hypothesis (also known as the Kurgan theory, Kurgan model, or steppe theory) is the most widely accepted proposal to identify the Proto-Indo-European homeland from which the Indo-European languages spread out throughout Europe and parts of Asia. It postulates that the people of a Kurgan culture in the Pontic steppe north of the Black Sea were the most likely speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE). The term is derived from the Turkic word &quot;kurgan&quot; (), meaning tumulus or burial mound.

The steppe theory was first formulated by Otto Schrader (1883) and V. Gordon Childe (1926), then systematized in the 1950s by Marija Gimbutas, who used the term to group various prehistoric cultures, including the Yamnaya (or Pit Grave) culture and its predecessors. In the 2000s, David Anthony instead used the core Yamnaya culture and its relationship with other cultures as a point of reference.

Gimbutas defined the Kurgan culture as composed of four successive periods, with the earliest (Kurgan I) including the Samara and Seroglazovo cultures of the Dnieper–Volga region in the Copper Age (early 4th millennium BC). The people of these cultures were nomadic pastoralists, who, according to the model, by the early 3rd millennium BC had expanded throughout the Pontic–Caspian steppe and into Eastern Europe.

Genetics studies in the 21st century have demonstrated that populations bearing specific Y-DNA haplogroups and a distinct genetic signature expanded into Europe and South Asia from the Pontic-Caspian steppe during the third and second millennia BC. These migrations provide a plausible explanation for the spread of at least some of the Indo-European languages, and suggest that the alternative theories such as the Anatolian hypothesis, which places the Proto-Indo-European homeland in Neolithic Anatolia, are less likely to be correct.

==History==
===Predecessors===
Arguments for the identification of the Proto-Indo-Europeans as steppe nomads from the Pontic–Caspian region had already been made in the 19th century by the German scholars, Theodor Benfey (1869) and (1870), followed notably by Otto Schrader (1883, 1890). Theodor Poesche had proposed the nearby Pinsk Marshes. In his standard work about PIE and to a greater extent in a later abbreviated version, Karl Brugmann took the view that the urheimat could not be identified exactly by the scholarship of his time, but he tended toward Schrader&#x27;s view. However, after Karl Penka&#x27;s 1883 rejection of non-European PIE origins, most scholars favoured a Northern European origin.

The view of a Pontic origin was still strongly supported, including by the archaeologists V. Gordon Childe and Ernst Wahle. One of Wahle&#x27;s students was Jonas Puzinas, who became one of Marija Gimbutas&#x27;s teachers. Gimbutas, who acknowledged Schrader as a precursor, painstakingly marshalled a wealth of archaeological evidence from the territory of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc that was not readily available to Western scholars, revealing a fuller picture of prehistoric Europe.

===Overview===
When it was first proposed in 1956, in &quot;The Prehistory of Eastern Europe, Part 1&quot;, Gimbutas&#x27;s contribution to the search for Indo-European origins was an interdisciplinary synthesis of archaeology and linguistics. The Kurgan model of Indo-European origins identifies the Pontic–Caspian steppe as the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) urheimat, and a variety of late PIE dialects are assumed to have been spoken across this region. According to this model, the Kurgan culture gradually expanded to the entire Pontic–Caspian steppe, Kurgan IV being identified with the Yamnaya culture of around 3000 BC.

The mobility of the Kurgan culture facilitated its expansion over the entire region and is attributed to the domestication of the horse followed by the use of early chariots. The first strong archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from the Sredny Stog culture north of the Azov Sea in Ukraine, and would correspond to an early PIE or pre-PIE nucleus of the 5th millennium BC. Subsequent expansion beyond the steppes led to hybrid, or in Gimbutas&#x27;s terms &quot;kurganized&quot; cultures, such as the Globular Amphora culture to the west. From these kurganized cultures came the immigration of Proto-Greeks to the Balkans and the nomadic Indo-Iranian cultures to the east around 2500 BC.

==Kurgan culture==

===Cultural horizon===
Gimbutas defined and introduced the term &quot;Kurgan culture&quot; in 1956 with the intention of introducing a &quot;broader term&quot; that would combine Sredny Stog II, Pit Grave (Yamnaya), and Corded ware horizons (spanning the 4th to 3rd millennia in much of Eastern and Northern Europe). The Kurgan archaeological culture or cultural horizon comprises the various cultures of the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the Copper Age to Early Bronze Age (5th to 3rd millennia BC), identified by similar artifacts and structures, but subject to inevitable imprecision and uncertainty. The eponymous kurgans (mound graves) are only one among several common features.

Cultures that Gimbutas considered as part of the &quot;Kurgan culture&quot;:
*Bug–Dniester (6th millennium)
*Samara (5th millennium)
*Khvalynsk (5th millennium)
*Dnieper–Donets (5th to 4th millennia)
*Sredny Stog (mid-5th to mid-4th millennia)
*Maykop–Deriivka (mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia)
*Yamnaya (Pit Grave): This is itself a varied cultural horizon, spanning the entire Pontic–Caspian steppe from the mid-4th to the 3rd millennium.
*Usatove (late 4th millennium)

===Stages of culture and expansion===

Gimbutas&#x27;s original suggestion identifies four successive stages of the Kurgan culture:
* Kurgan I, Dnieper/Volga region, earlier half of the 4th millennium BC. Apparently evolving from cultures of the Volga basin, subgroups include the Samara and Seroglazovo cultures.
* Kurgan II–III, latter half of the 4th millennium BC. Stone circles, anthropomorphic stone stelae of deities. Includes the Sredny Stog culture and the Maykop culture of the northern Caucasus. 
* Kurgan IV or Pit Grave (Yamnaya) culture, first half of the 3rd millennium BC, encompassing the entire steppe region from the Ural to Romania.

In other publications she proposes three successive &quot;waves&quot; of expansion:
* Wave 1, predating Kurgan I, expansion from the lower Volga to the Dnieper, leading to coexistence of Kurgan I and the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture. Repercussions of the migrations extend as far as the Balkans and along the Danube to the Vinča culture in Serbia and Lengyel culture in Hungary.
*Wave 2, mid 4th millennium BC, originating in the Maykop culture and resulting in advances of &quot;kurganized&quot; hybrid cultures into northern Europe around 3000 BC (Globular Amphora culture, Baden culture, and ultimately Corded Ware culture). According to Gimbutas this corresponds to the first intrusion of Indo-European languages into western and northern Europe.
*Wave 3, 3000–2800 BC, expansion of the Pit Grave culture beyond the steppes, with the appearance of the characteristic pit graves as far as modern Romania, Bulgaria, eastern Hungary and Georgia, coincident with the end of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture and Trialeti culture in Georgia ().

===Timeline===

*4500–4000: Early PIE. Sredny Stog, Dnieper–Donets and Samara cultures, domestication of the horse (Wave 1).
*4000–3500: The Pit Grave culture (a.k.a. Yamnaya culture), the prototypical kurgan builders, emerges in the steppe, and the Maykop culture in the northern Caucasus. Indo-Hittite models postulate the separation of Proto-Anatolian before this time.
*3500–3000: Middle PIE. The Pit Grave culture is at its peak, representing the classical reconstructed Proto-Indo-European society with stone idols, predominantly practicing animal husbandry in permanent settlements protected by hillforts, subsisting on agriculture, and fishing along rivers. Contact of the Pit Grave culture with late Neolithic Europe cultures results in the &quot;kurganized&quot; Globular Amphora and Baden cultures (Wave 2). The Maykop culture shows the earliest evidence of the beginning Bronze Age, and Bronze weapons and artifacts are introduced to Pit Grave territory. Probable early Satemization.
*3000–2500: Late PIE. The Pit Grave culture extends over the entire Pontic steppe (Wave 3). The Corded Ware culture extends from the Rhine to the Volga, corresponding to the latest phase of Indo-European unity, the vast &quot;kurganized&quot; area disintegrating into various independent languages and cultures, still in loose contact enabling the spread of technology and early loans between the groups, except for the Anatolian and Tocharian branches, which are already isolated from these processes. The centum–satem break is probably complete, but the phonetic trends of Satemization remain active.

===Further expansion during the Bronze Age===

The Kurgan hypothesis describes the initial spread of Proto-Indo-European during the 5th and 4th millennia BC. As used by Gimbutas, the term &quot;kurganized&quot; implied that the culture could have been spread by no more than small bands who imposed themselves on local people as an elite. This idea of PIE and its daughter languages diffusing east and west without mass movement proved popular with archaeologists in the 1970s (the &quot;pots-not-people&quot; paradigm). The question of further Indo-Europeanization of Central and Western Europe, Central Asia and Northern India during the Bronze Age is beyond the scope of the Kurgan hypothesis, and far more uncertain than the events of the Copper Age, and subject to some controversy. The rapidly developing fields of archaeogenetics and genetic genealogy since the late 1990s have not only confirmed a migratory pattern out of the Pontic Steppe at the relevant time but also suggest the possibility that the population movement involved was more substantial than earlier anticipated and invasive.

==Revisions==

=== Invasion versus diffusion scenarios (1980s onward) ===
Gimbutas believed that the expansions of the Kurgan culture were a series of essentially-hostile military incursions in which a new warrior culture imposed itself on the peaceful, matrilinear, and matrifocal (but not matriarchal) cultures of &quot;Old Europe&quot; and replaced it with a patriarchal warrior society, a process visible in the appearance of fortified settlements and hillforts and the graves of warrior-chieftains:
In her later life, Gimbutas increasingly emphasized the authoritarian nature of this transition from the egalitarian society centered on the nature/earth mother goddess (Gaia) to a patriarchy worshipping the father/sun/weather god (Zeus, Dyaus).

J. P. Mallory (in 1989) accepted the Kurgan hypothesis as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard theory of Indo-European origins, but he distinguished it from an implied &quot;radical&quot; scenario of military invasion. Gimbutas&#x27; actual main scenario involved slow accumulation of influence through coercion or extortion, as distinguished from general raiding shortly followed by conquest:
===Alignment with Anatolian hypothesis (2000s)===
In the 2000s, Alberto Piazza and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza tried to align the Anatolian hypothesis with the steppe theory. According to Piazza, &quot;[i]t is clear that, genetically speaking, peoples of the Kurgan steppe descended at least in part from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who immigrated there from Anatolia.&quot; According to Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006), the Yamna-culture may have been derived from Middle Eastern Neolithic farmers who migrated to the Pontic steppe and developed pastoral nomadism. Wells agrees with Cavalli-Sforza that there is &quot;&quot;some&quot; genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East.&quot; Nevertheless, the Anatolian hypothesis is incompatible with the linguistic evidence.

===Anthony&#x27;s revised steppe theory (2007)===
David Anthony&#x27;s &quot;The Horse, the Wheel and Language&quot; describes his &quot;revised steppe theory&quot;. He considers the term &quot;Kurgan culture&quot; so imprecise as to be useless, and instead uses the core Yamnaya culture and its relationship with other cultures as points of reference. He points out:
He does not include the Maykop culture among those that he considers to be Indo-European-speaking and presumes instead that they spoke a Caucasian language.

<text>The mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris) is a medium-sized broad-snouted crocodile, also known as mugger and marsh crocodile. It is native to freshwater habitats from south-eastern Iran to the Indian subcontinent, where it inhabits marshes, lakes, rivers and artificial ponds. It rarely reaches a body length of and is a powerful swimmer, but also walks on land in search of suitable waterbodies during the hot season. Both young and adult mugger crocodiles dig burrows to which they retreat when the ambient temperature drops below or exceeds . Females dig holes in the sand as nesting sites and lay up to 46 eggs during the dry season. The sex of hatchlings depends on temperature during incubation. Both parents protect the young for up to one year. They feed on insects, and adults prey on fish, reptiles, birds and mammals.

The mugger crocodile evolved at least and has been a symbol for the fructifying and destructive powers of the rivers since the Vedic period. It was first scientifically described in 1831 and is protected by law in Iran, India and Sri Lanka. Since 1982, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Outside protected areas, it is threatened by conversion of natural habitats, gets entangled in fishing nets and is killed in human–wildlife conflict situations and in traffic accidents.

== Taxonomy and evolution==
&quot;Crocodilus palustris&quot; was the scientific name proposed by René Lesson in 1831 who described the type specimen from the Gangetic plains. In subsequent years, several naturalists and curators of natural history museums described zoological specimens and proposed different names, including: 
*&quot;C. bombifrons&quot; by John Edward Gray in 1844 for a specimen sent by the Museum of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal to the British Museum of Natural History.
*&quot;C. trigonops&quot; also by Gray in 1844 for a young mugger specimen from India.

=== Evolution ===
Phylogenetic analysis of 23 crocodilian species indicated that the genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot; most likely originated in Australasia about . The freshwater crocodile (&quot;C. johnstoni&quot;) is thought to have been the first species that genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the genus about . The sister group comprising saltwater crocodile (&quot;C. porosus&quot;), Siamese crocodile (&quot;C. siamensis&quot;) and mugger crocodile diverged about . The latter diverged from this group about .
A paleogenomics analysis indicated that &quot;Crocodylus&quot; likely originated in Africa and radiated towards Southeast Asia and the Americas, diverging from its closest recent relative, the extinct &quot;Voay&quot; of Madagascar, around near the Oligocene/Miocene boundary.
Within &quot;Crocodylus&quot;, the mugger crocodile&#x27;s closest living relatives are the Siamese crocodile and the saltwater crocodile.

Fossil crocodile specimens excavated in the Sivalik Hills closely resemble the mugger crocodile in the shortness of the premaxillae and in the form of the nasal openings. In Andhra Pradesh’s Prakasam district, a long fossilized skull of a mugger crocodile was found in a volcanic ash bed that probably dates to the late Pleistocene. &quot;Crocodylus palaeindicus&quot; from late Pliocene sediments in the Sivalik Hills is thought to be an ancestor of the mugger crocodile. Fossil remains of &quot;C. palaeindicus&quot; were also excavated in the vicinity of Bagan in central Myanmar.


Below cladogram is from a tip dating study, for which morphological, molecular DNA sequencing and stratigraphic fossil age data were simultaneously used to establish the inter-relationships within Crocodylidae. This cladogram was revised in a paleogenomics study.
==Characteristics==

Mugger crocodile hatchlings are pale olive with black spots. Adults are dark olive to grey or brown. The head is rough without any ridges and has large scutes around the neck that is well separated from the back. Scutes usually form four, rarely six longitudinal series and 16 or 17 transverse series. The limbs have keeled scales with serrated fringes on outer edges, and outer toes are extensively webbed. The snout is slightly longer than broad with 19 upper teeth on each side. The symphysis of the lower jaw extends to the level of the fourth or fifth tooth. The premaxillary suture on the palate is nearly straight or curved forwards, and the nasal bones separate the premaxilla above.

The mugger crocodile is considered a medium-sized crocodilian, but has the broadest snout among living crocodiles. It has a powerful tail and webbed feet. Its visual, hearing and smelling senses are acute. Adult female muggers are on average; males usually measure , but rarely reach a length of . The two largest known muggers measured and were killed in Sri Lanka.
One individual weighing had a bite force of . Large males may reach a weight of .

The largest zoological specimen in the British Museum of Natural History measures . One male mugger caught in Pakistan of about weighed .

==Distribution and habitat==

The mugger crocodile occurs in southern Iran, Pakistan, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka up to an elevation of . It inhabits freshwater lakes, rivers and marshes, and prefers slow-moving, shallow water bodies. It also thrives in artificial reservoirs and irrigation canals.

In Iran, the mugger occurs along rivers in Sistan and Baluchestan Provinces along the Iran–Pakistan border. A population of around 200 mugger crocodiles lives on the Iranian Makran coast near Chabahar. Due to human activity and a long drought in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it had been pushed to the brink of extinction. Following several tropical cyclones in 2007 and 2010, much of the habitat of the mugger crocodiles has been restored as formerly dry lakes and hamuns were flooded again.

In Pakistan, a small population lives in 21 ponds around Dasht River; in the winter of 2007–08, 99 individuals were counted. By 2017, the population had declined to 25 individuals. In Sindh Province, small mugger populations occur in wetlands of Deh Akro-2 and Nara Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, near Chotiari Dam, in the Nara Canal and around Haleji lake.

In Nepal&#x27;s Terai, it occurs in the wetlands of Shuklaphanta and Bardia National Parks, Ghodaghodi Tal, Chitwan National Park and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve.

In India, it occurs in:
*Rajasthan along the Chambal, Ken and Son Rivers, and in Ranthambore National Park
*Gujarat along the Vishwamitri River and several reservoirs and lakes in Kutch
*Madhya Pradesh&#x27;s National Chambal Sanctuary
*Uttarakhand&#x27;s Rajaji National Park, Corbett Tiger Reserve and Lansdowne Forest Division 
*Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s Katarniaghat and Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuaries
*Odisha&#x27;s Simlipal National Park and along Mahanadi and Sabari Rivers In 2019, 82 individuals were recorded in the river systems of Simlipal National Park.
*Telangana&#x27;s Manjira Wildlife Sanctuary
*Maharashtra&#x27;s Kadavi and Warna Rivers, and Savitri River in Raigad District.
*Goa&#x27;s Salaulim Reservoir, Zuari River and in small lakes
*Karnataka along Kaveri and Kabini Rivers, in Ranganthittu Bird Sanctuary, Nagarhole National Park and Tungabhadra Reservoir
*Kerala&#x27;s Parambikulam Reservoir and Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary
*Tamil Nadu&#x27;s Amaravathi Reservoir, Moyar and Kaveri rivers.

In Sri Lanka, it occurs in Wilpattu, Yala and Bundala National Parks. Between 1991 and 1996, it was recorded in another 102 localities.

In Bangladesh, it was historically present in the northern parts of the Sundarbans, where four to five captive individuals survived in an artificial pond by the 1980s. It is possibly locally extinct in the country.
In Bhutan, it became extinct in the late 1960s, but a few captive-bred individuals were released in the Manas River in the late 1990s. It is considered locally extinct in Myanmar.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The mugger crocodile is a powerful swimmer that uses its tail and hind feet to move forward, change direction and submerge. It belly-walks, with its belly touching ground, at the bottom of waterbodies and on land. During the hot dry season, it walks over land at night to find suitable wetlands and spends most of the day submerged in water. During the cold season it basks on riverbanks, individuals are tolerant of others during this period. Territorial behaviour increases during the mating season.

Like all crocodilians, the mugger crocodile is a thermoconformer and has an optimal body temperature of and risks dying of freezing or hyperthermia when exposed to temperatures below or above , respectively. It digs burrows to retreat from extreme temperatures and other harsh climatic conditions. Burrows are between deep, with entrances above the water level and a chamber at the end that is big enough to allow the mugger to turn around. Temperatures inside remains constant at , depending on region.

===Hunting and diet===
The mugger crocodile preys on fish, snakes, turtles, birds and mammals including monkeys, squirrels, rodents, otters and dogs. It also scavenges on dead animals. During dry seasons, muggers walk many kilometers over land in search of water and prey. Hatchlings feed mainly on insects such as beetles, but also on crabs and shrimp and on vertebrates later on. It seizes and drags potential prey approaching watersides into the water, when the opportunity arises. Adult muggers were observed feeding on a flapshell turtle and a tortoise. Subadult and adult muggers favour fish, but also prey on small to medium-sized ungulates up to the size of chital (&quot;Axis axis&quot;).
At the Chambal River, muggers have attacked water buffaloes, cattle and goats.
In Bardia National Park, a mugger was observed caching a chital kill beneath the roots of a tree and returning to its basking site; a part of the deer was still wedged among the roots on the next day. In the same national park, a mugger caught a brown fish owl (&quot;Ketupa zeylonensis&quot;); several instances of water bird feathers in mugger dung have been reported.
Muggers have also been observed preying and feeding on pythons. 
In Yala National Park, a mugger killed a large Indian pangolin (&quot;Manis crassicaudata&quot;) and devoured pieces over several hours.

===Tool use===

Mugger crocodiles have been documented using lures to hunt birds. This means they are among the first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, they lure birds that are looking for nesting material. This strategy is particularly effective during the nesting season.

===Reproduction===
Female muggers obtain sexual maturity at a body length of around at the age of about 6.5 years, and males at around body length. The reproduction cycle starts earliest in November at the onset of the cold season with courtship and mating. Between February and June, females dig deep holes for nesting between away from the waterside. They lay up to two clutches with 8 –46 eggs each. Eggs weigh on average. Laying of one clutch usually takes less than half an hour. Thereafter, females scrape sand over the nest to close it. Males have been observed to assist females in digging and protecting nest sites. Hatching season is two months later, between April and June in south India, and in Sri Lanka between August and September. Then females excavate the young, pick them up in their snouts and take them to the water. Both females and males protect the young for up to one year.

Healthy hatchlings develop at a temperature range of . Sex ratio of hatched eggs depends on incubation temperature and exposure of nests to sunshine. Only females develop at constant temperatures of , and only males at . Percentage of females in a clutch decreases at constant temperatures between , and of males between . Temperature in natural nests is not constant but varies between nights and days. Foremost females hatch in natural early nests when initial temperature inside nests ranges between . The percentage of male hatchlings increases in late nests located in sunny sites. Hatchlings are long and weigh on average when one month old. They grow about per month and reach a body length of when two years old.

===Sympatric predators===

The distribution of the mugger crocodile overlaps with that of the saltwater crocodile in a few coastal areas, but it barely enters brackish water and prefers shallow waterways. It is an apex predator in freshwater ecosystems. It is sympatric with the gharial (&quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot;) in the Rapti and Narayani Rivers, in the eastern Mahanadi, and in tributaries of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.

The Bengal tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot;) occasionally fights mugger crocodiles off prey and rarely preys on adult mugger crocodiles in Ranthambore National Park. The Asiatic lion (&quot;Panthera leo leo&quot;) sometimes preys on crocodiles on the banks of the Kamleshwar Dam in Gir National Park during dry, hot months.

== Threats ==
The mugger crocodile is threatened by habitat destruction because of conversion of natural habitats for agricultural and industrial use. As humans encroach into its habitat, the incidents of conflict increase. Muggers are entangled in fishing equipment and drown, and are killed in areas where fishermen perceive them as competition.
Major wetlands in Pakistan were drained in the 1990s by dams and channels to funnel natural streams and agricultural runoffs into rivers.

In Gujarat, two muggers were found killed, one in 2015 with the tail cut off and internal organs missing; the other in 2017, also with the tail cut off. The missing body parts indicate that the crocodiles were sacrificed in superstitious practices or used as aphrodisiacs.
Between 2005 and 2018, 38 mugger crocodiles were victims of traffic accidents on roads and railway tracks in Gujarat; 29 were found dead, four died during treatment, and five were returned to the wild after medical care. In 2017, a dead mugger was found on a railway track in Rajasthan.

== Conservation ==
The mugger crocodile is listed in CITES Appendix I, hence international commercial trade is prohibited. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1982. By 2013, less than 8,700 mature individuals were estimated to live in the wild and no population unit to comprise more than 1,000 individuals.

In India, it has been protected since 1972 under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which prohibits catching, killing and transporting a crocodile without a permit; offenders face imprisonment and a fine.
In Sri Lanka, it was listed in Schedule IV of the Fauna &amp; Flora Protection Ordinance in 1946, which allowed for shooting one crocodile with a permit. Today, it is strictly protected, but law enforcement in Sri Lanka is lacking.
In Iran, the mugger crocodile is listed as endangered and has been legally protected since 2013; capturing and killing a crocodile is punished with a fine of 100 million Iranian rials.

Since large muggers occasionally take livestock, this leads to conflict with local people living close to mugger habitat. In Maharashtra, local people are compensated for loss of close relatives and livestock. Local people in Baluchestan respect the mugger crocodile as a water living creature and do not harm it. If an individual kills livestock, the owner is compensated for the loss. The mugger crocodile is translocated in severe conflict cases.

A total of 1,193 captive bred muggers were released to restock populations in 28 protected areas in India between 1978 and 1992. Production of new offspring was halted by the Indian Government in 1994.

==In culture==

The Sanskrit word () refers to the crocodile and a mythical crocodile-like animal. The Hindi word for crocodile is (). In English language, both names mugger and magar were used around the turn of the 20th century. The names &#x27;marsh crocodile&#x27; and &#x27;broad-snouted crocodile&#x27; have been used since the late 1930s.

The crocodile is acknowledged as the prototype of the makara and symbolises both the fructifying and the destructive powers of the rivers. It is the animal vehicle of the Vedic deity Varuna and of several nature spirits called yakshas. In Hindu mythology, it represents virility as a vehicle of Ganga and as an emblem of Kamadeva. A stone carving of a mugger crocodile was part of a beam of a gateway to the Bharhut Stupa built around 100 BC.

The traditional biography of the Indian saint Adi Shankara includes an incident where he is grabbed by a crocodile in the Kaladi river, which releases him only after his mother reluctantly let him choose the ascetic path of a Sannyasa. The Muslim saint Pīr Mango is said to have taken care of crocodiles and created a stream to trickle out of a rock near Karachi in the 13th century. This place was later walled around, and about 40 mugger crocodiles were kept in the reservoir called Magar Talao in the 1870s; they were fed by both Hindu and Muslim pilgrims. Mugger crocodiles have also been kept in tanks near Hindu temples built in the vicinity of rivers; these crocodiles are considered sacred. In the early 20th century, young married women fed the crocodiles in Khan Jahan Ali&#x27;s Tank in Jessore in the hope of being blessed with children.

Vasava, Gamit and Chodhri tribes in Gujarat worship the crocodile god Mogra Dev asking for children, good crops and milk yield of their cows. They carve wooden statues symbolising Mogra Dev and mount them on poles. Their offerings during the installation ceremony include rice, milk, wine, heart and liver of a chicken, and a mixture of vermillion, oil and coconut fibres. Fatal attacks of mugger crocodiles on humans were documented in Gujarat and Maharashtra, but they rarely consumed the victims who died of drowning.

A fable from the Jataka tales of Buddhist traditions features a clever monkey outwitting a crocodile. Three folktales feature crocodiles and jackals. A mugger crocodile is one of the characters in &quot;The Undertakers&quot;, a chapter of &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot;. The children’s book &quot;Adventures of a Nepali Frog&quot; features the character Mugger, the crocodile who lives by the Rapti River in Chitwan National Park.

<text>Fortitude Valley (often called &quot;The Valley&quot; by local residents) is an inner suburb of the City of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. In the , Fortitude Valley had a population of 9,708 people. The suburb features two pedestrian malls at Brunswick Street Mall and Chinatown, and is one of the hubs of Brisbane&#x27;s nightlife, renowned for its nightclubs, bars and adult entertainment.

== Geography ==
Fortitude Valley is built upon a low-lying marshy flat, immediately northeast of the Brisbane central business district.

== History ==

Originally inhabited by the Meanjin peoples of the Turrbal and Jagera/Yuggera Indigenous groups. Later on, Scottish immigrants from the ship arrived in Brisbane in 1849 in hopes to take the land, enticed by Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang on the promise of free land grants. Denied land, the immigrants set up camp in York&#x27;s Hollow waterholes in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Victoria Park, Herston, Queensland. A number of the immigrants moved on and settled the suburb, naming it after the ship on which they arrived.

Fortitude Valley National School opened on 4 March 1861 in a hall attached to the Foresters&#x27; Arms Hotel near the corner of Ann and Brunswick Streets, diagonally opposite the Royal George Hotel. The first purpose-built school opened at 95 Brookes Street on 12 August 1867. In 1874 an additional building was erected at 99 Brookes Street and the school was split into two separate departments – Fortitude Valley Boys&#x27; State School, and Fortitude Valley Girls&#x27; and Infants&#x27; State School. The year 1887 witnessed the opening of a further new school building for boys at 85 Brookes Street and in 1888 the Girls&#x27; and Infants&#x27; School was split again to create Fortitude Valley Girls&#x27; State School, and Fortitude Valley Infants&#x27; State School. In 1950 the Boys&#x27; and the Girls&#x27; campuses were amalgamated as the Fortitude Valley State School on the site of the former 1887 boys&#x27; school which was demolished in 1948/49. In 1951, the Infants&#x27; School merged with the Fortitude Valley State School. The school closed in December 2013 due to low student numbers, despite a prolonged campaign by parents and students to keep it open. The Queensland Government argued that there was another school only away that could accommodate the students. However, it was reopened in January 2020 as Fortitude Valley State Secondary College in response to a growing population in the area. It was Brisbane&#x27;s first new inner city school in more than 50 years, built vertically to fit in with the increased population density of the suburb.

A Primitive Methodist church opened in October 1861 in Windmill Street (now McLachlan Street).

All Hallows&#x27; School opened on 1 November 1861 by the Sisters of Mercy in the Dean&#x27;s Cottage beside the Catholic Cathedral (now Old St Stephen&#x27;s Church) in Adelaide Street in the Brisbane town centre. It was the first secondary school for girls in Queensland. Needing more space to accommodate a growing school they moved on 1 November 1863 to the house Adderton on Duncan&#x27;s Hill in Fortitude Valley.

In 1862 the Jireh Baptist Church opened in Fortitude Valley.

A Primitive Methodist church opened at 483 Brunswick Street on Sunday 15 October 1876.

A post office was established in 1887.

St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in Wickham Street by Father James Hanly, uphill from the Prince Consort Hotel. St Patrick&#x27;s Convent School was established later at the Wickham Street site. Both were wooden structures. In 1882, the congregation moved to a new (and still current) St Patrick&#x27;s Church in Morgan Street. On 5 December 1887, Cardinal Moran laid the foundation stone for a new school building in Ivory Street opening onto Hope Street at the rear. The new school opened in January 1889. In 1952 Brisbane City Council announced that it would be undertaking work in Ivory Street as part of a solution to eliminate traffic bottlenecks and St Patrick&#x27;s School was one of the affected properties. In 1955 the school buildings were relocated to the church grounds in Morgan Street. The school closed on 19 November 1982.

1891 saw the train line extended from the Brisbane central business district (the area around Queen Street) into Fortitude Valley, and Thomas Beirne opened a business on Brunswick Street. His business thrived and, after extension, he travelled to England in 1896, leaving his manager of two years, James McWhirter, in charge. Soon after his return, McWhirter established a competing drapery business opposite Beirne&#x27;s in 1898. Beirne and McWhirter became keen rivals and are credited with establishing the Valley as a hub of commerce from the late 1890s.

In the late 19th century, commercial activities in Brisbane were divided along religious lines, with Protestant shopkeepers setting up along Queen and Adelaide Streets in the central business district, and shops operated by Roman Catholics in Stanley Street, South Brisbane. However, in the 1893 Brisbane flood (and again in 1897), major floods wiped out many shops in South Brisbane, and owners in that area decided to move and set up operations north of the river in an area free of flooding. The area they chose was Fortitude Valley. By that time Brisbane&#x27;s horse-drawn tram system already centred on Fortitude Valley, making it the logical choice to establish a shopping precinct.

Fortitude Valley was also strongly advocated as the location of a new town hall in what became known as &quot;the battle of the sites&quot;. Brisbane Town Council already purchased a piece of land in Fortitude Valley and supporters of the Fortitude Valley site pointed out that it would allow stronger foundations compared to the swampy site proposed at Adelaide Street in the existing commercial district. However, a petition was raised in support of the Adelaide Street site and with the support of Charles Moffatt Jenkinson, the mayor of Brisbane in 1914, it was chosen over the Fortitude Valley site. Jenkinson committed the council to that decision by selling the site in Fortitude Valley to the Catholic Church for the construction of the Holy Name Cathedral (a project that, although commenced, made little progress and was eventually abandoned).

From the early 1900s through to the 1960s, the thriving shopping precinct was dominated by McWhirters, Beirne&#x27;s and, later, Overells&#x27; department stores. The Overells Building was completed in 1907. They were ultimately bought out by the Myer, David Jones and Waltons chains respectively with Overells being bought by Walton in 1956. Woolworths and Coles supermarkets and a host of smaller shops also flourished in the precinct during this period. Owing to its proximity to the central business district and the close concentration of public transport in the area, the Valley became the largest non-CBD shopping precinct in Australia through the 1950s and 1960s.

Between 1923 and 1948 mixed gender opportunity classes for the intellectually impaired and handicapped were conducted at the boys&#x27; school. In 1951 the Fortitude Valley Opportunity School was approved and operated as a separate entity in its own right shortly afterwards. The school closed in 1961.

The rise of suburban shopping centres and the closure of the tram network in 1969 sounded the death knell for Fortitude Valley, with a gradual decrease in customers. David Jones closed its Valley store in the 1970s and Myer closed its doors in the early 1990s.

In 2010, the Music Industry College opened at 458 Wickham Street with 27 students. In 2014 the college relocated to its own premises at 38 Berwick Street.

In 2017, the Angelorum College opened at 377 St Pauls Terrace as an independent Catholic school, established by families who had previously been home schooling their children.

== Entertainment district ==
=== Chinatown ===
The Chinatown Mall is a pedestrian street which occupies all of Duncan Street opened in 1987 as the first step to the revitalisation of Fortitudes Valley&#x27;s entertainment district. The Mall runs parallel to Brunswick Street Mall, and connects Wickham Street and Ann Street.

The 1990s saw the development of Fortitude Valley into a thriving live music scene and nightclub district. In 1991, the Brunswick Street pedestrian shopping mall was established. Thereafter, the Brisbane City Council led a concerted urban renewal campaign, encouraging high density residential development around the suburb.

In 2012, around 50,000 people head to Fortitude Valley&#x27;s clubs, pubs and restaurants each weekend night. Around 30 venues are licensed to trade until 3:00 am.

=== Valley Music Harmony Plan ===
In 1999, residents&#x27; complaints about neighbouring clubs&#x27; live music threatened the closure of the Empire Hotel and the Press Club, two established venues. Musicians and their fans revolted through the &quot;Save the Music&quot; campaign and, 20,000 signatures later, petitioned Brisbane City Council and the Queensland Government to address the emerging problem. The Brisbane City Council commenced the development of a Valley Music Harmony Plan in July 2002. The aim of the Valley Music Harmony Plan is to manage the impacts of music noise on residents and businesses without compromising the viability of the entertainment industry in Fortitude Valley.

That resulted in 2005 in Fortitude Valley becoming Australia&#x27;s first &quot;Special Entertainment Precinct&quot;, designed to protect both live music and new residents through planning restrictions. The Special Entertainment Precinct status exempts entertainment venues within the area from the amplified noise requirements of the Liquor Act 1992, and allows council to manage amplified music noise under the Amplified Music Venues Local Law 2006. But it also requires new residential and accommodation development construction to achieve a minimum noise reduction of 25 decibels in the 63 hertz frequency band.

=== Drink Safe Precinct ===
The Fortitude Valley Drink Safe Precinct was a two-year-long trial starting in December 2010. Trials also took place in Surfers Paradise and Townsville. After one year club owners responded positively to the trial. Statistics released in May 2012 showed arrests, evictions and tickets for liquor infringements have declined.

== Transport ==

Transport for Brisbane operates buses to, from and through Fortitude Valley. Fortitude Valley railway station serves all suburban and interurban lines, including Airport line service to Brisbane Airport. The station has four platforms and is located in Zone 1 of the Translink integrated public transport system.

=== Taxis ===
Secure taxi ranks to enable patrons to catch a taxi home are set up at various strategic points and enable easy access without the need to hail a cab. Fortitude Valley has five locations with these ranks on Friday and Saturday night. Funding for this free service is provided by the Brisbane City Council, the Queensland State Government and the Taxi Council of Queensland. These secure ranks are staffed by taxi supervisors and security guards to ensure commuters an orderly and safe environment whilst they wait for service. A &#x27;Chaplain&#x27; service also operates where some people might be suffering the effects of excess drugs or alcohol and need some care and attention in a safe place rather than on a bench or footpath. The combination of these services have reputedly assisted in reducing the incidents of fights, disputes and arrests especially between the hours of midnight and 5 am on weekends.

=== Speed limits ===
On 24 August 2007, a speed limit was introduced to parts of Wickham Street, Ann Street, McLachlan Street and Warner Street. The speed limit applies between 10 pm and 6 am from Friday to Sunday night. The speed limit was introduced following safety audits of the Fortitude Valley identifying pedestrian-vehicle conflict as a major issue.

== James Street Precinct ==
Fortitude Valley&#x27;s James Street is a retail and lifestyle precinct, beaming with lush tropical tree coverage and vines. While redeveloped and repurposed, Fortitude Valley&#x27;s James Street precinct pays homage to its industrial past, while also celebrating contemporary Brisbane.

<doc id="1070160" wikidata="Q212509" url="?curid=1070160" title="William Lane">
<text>William Lane (6 September 1861 – 26 August 1917) was an English-born journalist, author, advocate of Australian labour politics and a utopian socialist ideologue.

Lane was born in Bristol, England into an impoverished family. After showing great skill in his education, he worked his way into Canada as first a linotype operator, then as a reporter for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; where he would later meet his future wife Ann Lane, &quot;née&quot; Macquire. After settling in Australia with his wife and child, as well as his brother John, he became active in the Australian labour movement, founding the Australian Labour Federation and becoming a prolific journalist for the movement. He authored works covering topics such as labour rights and white nationalism.

After becoming disillusioned with the state of Australian politics following an ideological split in the labour movement, he and a group of utopian acolytes (among them influential writer and poet Mary Gilmore) moved to Paraguay in 1892 to found New Australia, with the intention of building a new society on the foundations of his utopian ideals. Following disagreement with the colony regarding the legality of miscegenation and alcohol consumption, he left to found the nearby colony Cosme (also known as Colonia Cosme) in May 1894, and later abandoned the project altogether in 1899.

Upon resettling in New Zealand, he continued his journalistic endeavours until his death in August 1917. After his death he was both celebrated as a champion of utopian socialism, and condemned as the arrogant leader of a failed new society. Due to his radical politics and his extensive journalistic career, he remains a controversial figure in Australian history.

==Early life==
Lane was born in Bristol, England on 6 September 1861, as the eldest son of James Lane, an Irish Protestant landscape gardener, and his English wife Caroline, &quot;née&quot; Hall. Lane was born with a debilitating clubfoot, a condition that would be partially corrected in Montreal later in life, leaving him with a limp. Lane&#x27;s father James was a drunkard who when Lane was born was earning a miserable wage, but later he improved his circumstances and became an employer.

The young Lane was educated at Bristol Grammar School and demonstrated himself as a gifted student, but he was sent early to work as an office boy. Lane&#x27;s mother died when he was 14 years of age, and at age 16 he migrated to Canada where he worked odd jobs such as a linotype operator. During this time he began engrossed in the writings of economist Henry George and socialist Edward Bellamy. In 1881 by the age of 24 he became a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, where he would meet his future wife Ann Macquire whom he would marry on 22 July 1883.

==Radical journalism in Australia==
In 1885 William and Ann Lane, along with brother John, as well as their first child migrated to Brisbane, Australia, where Lane immediately got work as a feature writer for the weekly newspaper &quot;Queensland Figaro&quot;, then as a columnist for the newspapers Brisbane Courier and the Evening Telegraph, using a number of pseudonyms (&quot;Lucinda Sharpe&quot;, which some consider to be the work of Lane&#x27;s spouse; &quot;William Wilcher;&quot; and &quot;Sketcher&quot;).

Lane&#x27;s childhood experiences as the son of a drunkard fashioned him into a lifelong abstainer from alcohol. In 1886 he created an Australia-wide sensation by spending a night in the Brisbane lock-up disguised as a drunk, and subsequently reporting the conditions of the cells as &quot;Henry Harris&quot;. Lane&#x27;s father was a drunk who impoverished the family.

With the growth of the Australian labour movement, Lane&#x27;s columns under the &quot;Sketcher&quot; pseudonym, especially his &quot;Labour Notes&quot; in the Evening Telegraph, began to increasingly promote labourist philosophy. Lane himself began to attend meetings supporting all manner of popular causes, speaking against repressive laws and practices and Chinese immigrants, all while utilising a charismatic American intonation he had attained during his time in the States.

After becoming the de facto editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, Lane left the newspaper during November 1887 to found the weekly &quot;The Boomerang&quot;, a newspaper described as &quot;a live newspaper, racy, of the soil&quot;, in which pro-worker themes and lurid racism were brought to a fever-pitch by both &quot;Sketcher&quot; and &quot;Lucinda Sharpe&quot;. He became a powerful supporter of Emma Miller and women&#x27;s suffrage. A strong proponent of Henry George&#x27;s Single Tax Movement, Lane became increasingly committed to a radically alternative society, and ended his relationship with the &quot;Boomerang&quot; due to its private ownership.

In May 1890 he began the trade union funded Brisbane weekly &quot;The Worker&quot;, the rhetoric of which became increasingly threatening towards the employers, the government, and the British Empire itself. The defeat of the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike convinced Lane that there would be no real social change without a completely new society, and &quot;The Worker&quot; became increasingly devoted to his New Australia utopian idea which would later be made a reality.

===&quot;White or Yellow?&quot;===

Although his efforts were primarily directed towards the non-fictional, Lane was an avid author whose works deeply reflected his political philosophy, as short as his bibliography is. &quot;The Workingman&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, an allegorical novel written in sympathy with those involved in the 1891 shearers&#x27; strike, was published under his pseudonym John Miller in early 1892. In the novel Lane articulated the belief that anarchism is the noblest social philosophy of all. Through the novel&#x27;s philosopher and main protagonist he relates his belief that society may have to experience a period of state socialism to achieve the ideal of anarcho-communism. Mary Gilmore, later a celebrated Australian writer, said in one of her letters that &quot;the whole book is true and of historical value as Lane transcribed our conversations as well as those of others&quot;.

Most prominent in his bibliography is his novella &quot;White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908&quot; (1887). In this work, Lane proposed a horde of Chinese people would legally arrive to Australia, who would then overrun White society and monopolise the industries important to exploiting the natural resources of the &quot;empty north&quot; of the continent. As Australian invasion literature, &quot;White or Yellow?&quot; reflects Lane&#x27;s nationalist racialism and left-wing politics within a future history of Australia under attack by the Yellow Peril.
Lane wrote that in the near future, British capitalists would manipulate the legal system and successfully arrange the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of its socioeconomic consequences to Australian common folk and their society. The economic, cultural, and sexual conflicts that resulted from the capitalists&#x27; manipulation of the Australian economy would then provoke a race war throughout the continent, fought between the White settlers and Chinese workers.

The racialist representations of Yellow Peril ideology in the narrative of &quot;White or Yellow?&quot; work to justify forcible expulsion and murder of Chinese workers as an acceptable response to the loss of physical and economic control of Australia. Historically the leaders of the Australian labour and trade unions greatly opposed the importation of Chinese workers, whom they portrayed as an economic threat to Australia due to their eagerness to work for low wages, as well as them presenting a libertine and race-diluting threat to Christian civilisation. Lane&#x27;s work was intended to act as an apolitical call to racial unity among white Australians.

Contriving a division among Australian labour activists between the permanently disaffected and those who later formed the Australian Labor Party, Lane refused the Queensland Government&#x27;s offer of a grant of land on which to create a utopian settlement, and began an Australia-wide campaign for the creation of a new society elsewhere on the globe, peopled by rugged and sober Australian bushmen and their proud wives.

Eventually Paraguay was decided upon, and Lane and his family, including his brother John, together with hundreds of acolytes (238 total) from New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, made their way to South America. The first group of pioneers departed Sydney in the ship &quot;Royal Tar&quot; on 1 July 1893. A second group sailed from Adelaide on the last day of 1893. Both voyages were bound for Montevideo, Uruguay, followed by an arduous overland trek to Paraguay.

New Australia soon had its crisis, brought on by the issues of interracial relationships (Lane singled out the Guarani as racially taboo) and alcohol. Lane&#x27;s dictatorial manner soon alienated many in the community, and by the time the second boatload of utopians arrived from Adelaide in 1894, Lane had left with a core of devotees to form a new colony nearby named Cosme.

Eventually, amidst an array of criticism and objections to Lane&#x27;s leadership, a strong internal dispute appeared between the two main groups that conformed the colony (one approving of Lane&#x27;s politics and overarching decisions, and one very critical of them). Lane became disillusioned with the whole process, willingly abandoned Colonia Cosme, and returned to Australia in 1899.

A number of important people were born and raised in New Australia&#x27;s settlements, including world famous comic book writer Robin Wood; Anne Whitehead&#x27;s 1997 book on New Australia, &quot;Paradise Mislaid&quot;, provides a chapter on Robin Wood&#x27;s childhood with his extended Australian-Paraguayan family. To this day, there are as many as 2,000 Australian Paraguayans in Paraguay.

==Later life==
Lane left Cosme with his family on 1 August 1899, and returned to Australia where he worked briefly as editor of the &quot;Sydney Worker&quot; before sailing to New Zealand. After initial melancholia, he soon refound his old verve as a feature writer from 1900 for the &quot;New Zealand Herald,&quot; writing under the pseudonym &#x27;Tohunga&#x27; (the Maori word for prophet), only this time as ultra-conservative and pro-Empire. He had retained the strong racial antipathy toward East Asians he expressed in his literature, and during World War I he developed extreme anti-German sentiments.

Lane died on 26 August 1917 in Auckland, New Zealand, aged 56, having been editor of the &quot;Herald&quot; from 1913 to 1917, and becoming a much admired personality in the country.

Before his own death, Lane had lost one son, Charles, at a cricket match in Colonia Cosme (Paraguay), and another, Donald, on the first day of the ANZAC landings (25 April 1915) at the beaches of Gallipoli.

==Legacy==
Lane is depicted in the Douglas Stewart poem &quot;Terra Australis&quot;.

<text>Jason Keema Hart (born April 29, 1978) is an American basketball coach and former professional player who is currently an assistant coach for the University of Kentucky.

== College career ==
From 1996 to 2000, he attended New York&#x27;s Syracuse University, where he became the first freshman in the Big East Conference&#x27;s history to lead it in minutes played. Later on, he earned other accolades as an NCAA player, such as becoming his college&#x27;s all-time leader in steals and second place among assist leaders. As a senior, Hart made the Big East&#x27;s All-First Team. He was also selected to the Syracuse All-Century Basketball team.

== NBA career ==
Hart joined the NBA with the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2000–01 season, but he only saw action in one game, scoring two points.

Starting the 2001–02 season in the newly created NBDL with the Asheville Altitude, he was called in December by the San Antonio Spurs, appearing in 10 games. He played in the Greek A1 League with Makedonikos BC in 2002–03, returning to the Spurs for the 2003–04 season, where he played in 53 games, averaging 3.3 points.

Hart was signed by the Bobcats as a free agent before the 2004–05 season, and made the first steal in Bobcats history in their first game. Previously, in a 126-125 losing effort in their first preseason game, Hart made a three-point shot as time expired to send the game against the Washington Wizards into a second overtime period en route to 19 points.

In the 2004–05 season, Hart set career highs in many categories including: points per game (9.5), assists per game (5.0), and rebounds per game (2.7). He finished third in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio, with 3.6 assists for every turnover. After the season, Hart was traded to the Sacramento Kings.

On March 2, 2007, Hart was waived by the Kings. He was signed a few days later by the Los Angeles Clippers. On July 13, 2007, Hart signed with the Utah Jazz. Originally serving as the backup to Deron Williams, an injury forced him to sit for 8 games. Ronnie Price&#x27;s solid play during that time nearly removed him from the rotation.

On July 23, 2008, Hart was traded back to the Clippers in exchange for Brevin Knight.

On February 27, 2009, Hart was waived by the Clippers.

On March 3, 2009, Hart was signed by the Nuggets for the remainder of the season.

On September 28, 2009, Hart signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was traded to the Phoenix Suns on December 29, 2009, for Alando Tucker and cash. The Suns immediately waived him. On February 5, 2010, Hart signed a ten-day contract with the New Orleans Hornets. Hart&#x27;s final NBA game was on February 10, 2010, in a 93–85 win over the Boston Celtics. In his final game, Hart recorded two assists and one rebound.

==Coaching career==
After his playing career ended, Hart coached AAU basketball in Los Angeles and served as head coach at Taft High School in LA. On May 12, 2012, Hart was hired as an assistant coach at Pepperdine, under head coach Marty Wilson. In 2013, he joined Andy Enfield&#x27;s staff at the University of Southern California. In 2021, he was named the head coach of the NBA G League Ignite, a developmental team for players coming out of high school that plays against other teams in the NBA G League. In March of 2024, NBA G League President Shareef Abdur-Rahim announced that the G League Ignite program would be shut down after the season citing &quot;the changing basketball landscape, including the NCAA&#x27;s Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) policy and the advent of collectives and the transfer portal&quot; as the main factors. With the program ending, Hart was now unemployed. On April 22, Hart was hired as an assistant coach for Mark Pope&#x27;s University of Kentucky Wildcats.

==Personal==
Jason Hart was born in Los Angeles, California. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Brandi Hart. They live with their two sons Jason Jr. and Justin. Hart&#x27;s cousin is 2011–12 Syracuse Orange men&#x27;s basketball player Brandon Triche.

<text>České dráhy (English: &quot;Czech Railways&quot;), often shortened to ČD, is the major railway operator in the Czech Republic providing regional and long-distance services.

The company was established in January 1993, shortly after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, as a successor of the Czechoslovak State Railways. It is a member of the International Railway Union (UIC Country Code for the Czech Republic is 54), the Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies, and the Organization for Cooperation of Railways. With twenty-four thousand employees ČD Group is the fifth largest Czech company by the number of employees.

==History==
In 1827–1836, the České Budějovice–Linz railway was built, which was the second horse-drawn railway in continental Europe was established. The first steam-hauled railway in the area was established in 1839, from Vienna to Břeclav. The first standard gauge electrified railway track in the area was built in 1903.

Czechoslovak State Railways (, abbreviated as ČSD), the predecessor of České dráhy, was established in 1918. In 1991, the first EuroCity (EC) trains ran on ČSD railways.

České dráhy was founded in 1993, following the breakup of Czechoslovakia. The company began a program of renovating Pan-European railway corridors the same year. The following year, the company launched truck transportation (&quot;RoLa&quot;) on ČD railways from Lovosice to Dresden, which it stopped in 2004.

During the 1990s, there was a noticeable drop in railway traffic throughout the Czech Republic, a phenomenon that coincided with a massive expansion in road transport. Seeking to halt, or even partially reverse, this trend, substantial efforts were made to restructure and modernise the railways and their operation. One such measure was the establishment of České dráhy as a joint stock company in January 2003; soon thereafter, various subsidiaries were created that focused on various sectors, such as research, telecommunications, and rolling stock maintenance. Officials were keen to reduce the organisation&#x27;s losses and to make it a commercially competitive venture, thus numerous reforms were implemented around this time, which included the centralisation of some activities (such as purchasing and internal stocking) while other activities were outsourced to third parties to increase efficiency. There was a general trend towards reducing employee headcount while various new technologies were brought in.

In 2005, Pendolino tilting trains entered the operator&#x27;s regular service.

In subsequent years, the company&#x27;s liabilities grew exponentially. Liabilities increased from 19 billion Czech koruna (CZK) at the end of 2006 to CZK 53 billion at the end of 2015.

For the second phase of this restructuring, on 1 December 2007, České dráhy spun off its freight operations into the newly established ČD Cargo, which remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of České dráhy. Prior to 1 July 2008, České dráhy was the biggest employer in the Czech Republic. Prior to the late 2000s, the organisation had historically incurred losses as a matter of routine, thus necessitating the provision of subsidies from the Czech government. However, during 2007, České dráhy recorded a profit of 53 million CZK (2.1 million Euros), which was the first time the company had recorded a profit in its history. Despite this milestone, České dráhy has continued to receive government subsidies and undergo periodic reforms with the aim of cutting costs to become a routinely profitable operating concern.

In 2008, ČD Sky, an alliance between České dráhy and the airline SkyEurope, was created. SkyEurope, which was heavily indebted, ceased operations in August 2009.

Measures aimed at increasing operating efficiency have spanned various aspects of the organisation. During January 2008, plans to transfer passenger transport operations to an independent subsidiary were met with approval from the Czech government. While České dráhy is responsible for operating train services, the management and operation of the railway infrastructure (such as the tracks, signals, and stations) is managed by Správa železniční dopravní cesty (SŽDC). During December 2010, the Czech government proposed bringing SŽDC and ČD together in a single holding company. Around this time, the government also changed the subsidy available to both ČD and SŽDC. During 2018, plans were mooted for the privatisation of subsidiary ČD Cargo. However, in November of that year, it was announced that no change would occur and that ČD Cargo would remain a state-owned entity; this was reportedly due to a decision by Andrej Babiš, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, to veto the proposal.

During the 2010s, the open-access operator RegioJet has competed directly with České dráhy for passenger patronage between Prague and Ostrava. On 29 September 2011, the latter adopted similar pricing to those charged by RegioJet on the same route, which RegioJet declared to be unfair competition and a misuse of České dráhy&#x27;s dominant position. Two years later, RegioJet took legal action over České dráhy&#x27;s pricing policy, alleging its negative impact on its business results. During June 2022, the European Commission claimed that, between 2012 and 2016, České dráhy and the Austrian train operator ÖBB had colluded to prevent RegioJet from obtaining long-distance coaches from the latter.

In 2014, the first &quot;ČD Railjet&quot; with passengers ran in the Czech Republic.

Modern rolling stock from international manufacturers has been purchases on multiple occasions. Perhaps the most prominent is the ČD Class 680 Pendolino, a high speed tilting train, which was originally intended for operating international services between Berlin, Prague, and Vienna. A successor to the Pendolino was reportedly being sought during the early 2020s; the company has also declared its ambitions to build a dedicated high speed network akin to the TGV. During the 2010s, both České dráhy and freight subsidiary ČD Cargo were operating Siemens Vectron electric locomotives; these have often been leased from other companies. In December 2021, a CZK 5 billion (225.4 million United States dollars) contract for a further 31 three-car RegioPanter electric multiple units (EMUs) was issued to Škoda Transportation, making for a total fleet size of 110 such trains operated by České dráhy. The company has also explored the use of alternative fuel vehicles.

In 2019, the supervisory board of České dráhy dismissed its Chairman , who has been in office since September 2018, as Kupec faced an investigation over possible illegal conduct.

In November 2022, it was announced that Czech plans to subsidise electrified rail operations had been approved by the European Commission, benefitting companies such as České dráhy. That same month, plans were revealed to modernise in excess of 2,000 coaches and other rail vehicles over the next four years at an annual cost of roughly Koruna 3.5bn (142.2 million United States dollars).

==Statistics==


During 2015, České dráhy recorded that its consolidated revenues were CZK 33 billion. Comprising this figure were revenues from passenger transport, which amounted to CZK 21 billion (64% transfer payments from the government, 24% intrastate transport, 12% international transport), along with revenues from freight transport operated by subsidiary ČD Cargo, which amounted to CZK 11 billion.

* of railway lines operated by ČD, of which was electrified track and is double- and multiple-track, all of them transferred to the infrastructure operator Správa železnic since.
