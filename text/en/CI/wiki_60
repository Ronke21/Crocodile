<text>Marianne Deborah Williamson (born July 8, 1952) is an American author, speaker, and political activist. She began her professional career as spiritual leader of the Church of Today, a Unity Church in Warren, Michigan. Williamson has written several self-help books, including &quot;A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course in Miracles&quot; in 1992, which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. She was launched into prominence by Oprah Winfrey, being a frequent guest on her daytime talk show and becoming known as her &quot;spiritual advisor&quot;.

Williamson ran unsuccessfully as an independent for California&#x27;s 33rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in 2014, finishing fourth with 13.2% of the vote. She ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, eventually dropping out and endorsing Bernie Sanders. She ran in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries, challenging incumbent President Joe Biden. Williamson&#x27;s presidential platform calls for an end to the war on drugs, a federal minimum wage increase, reparations for racial injustice, addressing climate change, and creating a U.S. Department of Peace. On February 7, 2024, she announced she had suspended her campaign after receiving 2.9% of the vote in the Nevada Democratic primary, but on February 28, 2024, Williamson re-entered the presidential race after placing third in the Michigan Democratic primary, receiving 3% of the vote. However, on June 11, 2024, Williamson suspended her campaign. On July 2, 2024, Williamson re-entered the presidential race amidst calls for Biden to drop out after his June 27 debate performance, before later dropping out again on July 29. She announced her bid for DNC chair on December 26, 2024.

Williamson has been actively involved with charity work, founding such organizations as Center for Living in 1987, Project Angel Food in 1989, and the Peace Alliance in 1998. She sits on the board for RESULTS, a nonprofit group which is dedicated to finding long-term solutions to poverty.

==Early life and education==
Williamson was born in Houston, Texas, in 1952. She is the youngest of three children of Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Williamson, a World War II veteran and immigration lawyer, and Sophie Ann Kaplan, a homemaker and community volunteer.

Williamson was raised in an upper-middle-class family that practiced Conservative Judaism. Her family attended Congregation Beth Yeshurun. She learned about world religions and social justice at home and became interested in public advocacy when she saw her rabbi speak against the Vietnam War.

In 1965, after Williamson came home from school in the seventh grade, she recounted to her parents that her teacher supported the Vietnam War. Her father reacted by taking the family to Vietnam to help explain to Marianne why he thought that the war was wrong. She has said that through travel she &quot;had an experience, at a young age, that people are the same everywhere.&quot;

Williamson attended Houston ISD&#x27;s Bellaire High School. After graduating, she spent two years studying theater and philosophy at Pomona College in Claremont, California, where she was a roommate of future film producer Lynda Obst. 
In 1973, Williamson dropped out of college and lived &quot;a nomadic existence&quot; during what she calls &quot;her wasted decade&quot;.

Williamson moved to New Mexico, where she took classes at the University of New Mexico and lived in a geodesic dome with her boyfriend. The couple broke up a year later. Marianne then moved to Austin, Texas, where she took classes at the University of Texas. After leaving Texas, she went to New York City, intending to pursue a career as a cabaret singer; however, she has stated that she was distracted by &quot;bad boys and good dope&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote that Williamson &quot;spent her twenties in a growing state of existential despair.&quot; In New York, Williamson suffered from deep depression following the end of a relationship. She has said that this experience gave rise to a desire to spend the rest of her life helping people.

==&quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;==
Although initially uninterested due to her Jewish faith, Williamson developed an interest in Helen Schucman&#x27;s book &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; in 1976. She explored spirituality, metaphysics, and meditation as she began reading the &quot;Course&quot; &quot;passionately&quot;. She also reconciled the &quot;Course&quot; with her Jewishness; in her view, &quot;A conversion to Christ is not a conversion to Christianity. It is a conversion to a conviction of the heart&quot;.

Williamson said the book was her &quot;path out of hell&quot;, as she had been &quot;mired in a series of unhappy love affairs, alcohol and drug abuse, a nervous breakdown, and endless sessions with therapists.&quot; The &quot;Course&quot; has often been described as a religion or pseudoreligion. Williamson disagrees, describing it as a &quot;spiritual psychotherapy&quot; instead of a religion.

==Career==
In 1979, Williamson returned to Houston, where she ran a metaphysical bookstore coffee shop, sang Gershwin standards in a nightclub, got married and divorced &quot;almost immediately&quot;, and underwent a &quot;spiritual surrender&quot;.

In 1983, Williamson had what she has called a &quot;flash&quot; to close the coffee shop and move to Los Angeles. She got an apartment in Hollywood, where her roommate was 17-year-old Laura Dern. Dern has stated that Williamson &quot;held prayer groups in our living room.&quot;

Williamson&#x27;s teachings stemmed from an inspirational message: &quot;Divine love is the core and essence of every human mind.&quot; She saw this message as a remedy to misinterpretations of the Bible that, through an emphasis on sin and guilt, could lead to harm (e.g., slavery, depression, self-loathing).

As word spread about &quot;the young woman talking about a God who loves you, no matter what,&quot; she had to rent church space to accommodate the demand to hear her speak. In 1987, she began lecturing monthly in New York. Eventually, she was invited to speak throughout the U.S. and Europe. Williamson did not charge for her lectures but had a &quot;suggested donation&quot; of $7 and a policy of not turning people away for lack of money. Williamson&#x27;s style has been described as a &quot;trendy amalgam of Christianity, Buddhism, pop psychology and 12-step recovery wisdom&quot;.

=== Unity Church Pastor ===
Williamson became the spiritual leader for the Church of Today, a Unity Church in Warren, Michigan, where she had 2,300 congregants and 50,000 television viewers. Her position also included administrative leadership; her actions as leader included booking Aerosmith&#x27;s Steven Tyler, expanding the bookstore, and increasing the congregation&#x27;s racial and sexual orientation diversity. As a result, the Church grew rapidly.

Williamson resigned from the Church Renaissance Unity Interfaith Spiritual Fellowship in 2003. For a time, she lectured at Methodist, Episcopal and Unitarian churches.

=== Author ===

Williamson has written 14 books . Seven have appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, with four reaching number one. She has sold more than three million books.

Williamson&#x27;s most popular work is &quot;A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course in Miracles&quot; (1992). The book appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 39 weeks in the &quot;Advice, How To and Miscellaneous&quot; category; it teaches that practicing love every day will bring more peace and fulfillment to one&#x27;s life. The following quotation is the most famous quotation from the book (it is often misattributed to Nelson Mandela):Oprah Winfrey said of the book, &quot;I have never been more moved by a book than I am by this one.&quot; Winfrey bought 1,000 copies and encouraged her audience to purchase it, telling them that after reading it, she experienced 157 miracles. Williamson was a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and became Oprah&#x27;s spiritual advisor.

==Political campaigns ==
===2014 U.S. House of Representatives campaign===
In 2014, Williamson ran as an Independent for California&#x27;s 33rd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Prominent elected and public officials endorsed her campaign, including Ben Cohen; former governors Jennifer Granholm and Jesse Ventura; former representatives Dennis Kucinich and Alan Grayson; and Van Jones. Alanis Morissette wrote and performed Williamson&#x27;s campaign song, &quot;Today&quot;.

Williamson campaigned on progressive issues such as campaign finance reform, women&#x27;s reproductive rights and LGBTQ equality. She raised $2.4 million, of which she personally contributed 25 percent.

Williamson finished fourth out of 18 candidates, with 14,335 votes or 13.2 percent of the vote. Republican Elan Carr finished first in the primary with 21.6 percent of the vote, but went on to lose the general election to Democrat Ted Lieu.

===2020 presidential campaign===

On November 15, 2018, Williamson announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee. On January 28, 2019, Williamson officially launched her presidential campaign before an audience of 2,000 people in Los Angeles. She appointed Maurice Daniel, who served alongside Donna Brazile in Dick Gephardt&#x27;s campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1988, as her national campaign manager. Williamson&#x27;s campaign committee, &quot;Marianne Williamson for President&quot;, officially filed on February 4.

As of May 1, Williamson had a campaign staff of 20. A week later, she announced she had received enough contributions from unique donors to enter the official primary debates. Her campaign had raised $1.5 million (~$ in ) in the first quarter of 2019, during which it received donations from 46,663 unique individuals. Williamson subsequently met the polling criteria, with three unique polls at one percent from qualifying pollsters, on May 23.

In June, Williamson confirmed that she had moved to Des Moines, Iowa, in advance of the 2020 caucuses. In response to the Iowa Democratic Party&#x27;s proposed creation of &quot;virtual caucuses&quot; in the 2020 race, Williamson&#x27;s campaign announced it would appoint 99 &quot;Virtual Iowa Caucus Captains&quot; (each assigned to a single county) to turn out supporters in both the virtual and in-person caucuses.

Later that month, Williamson participated in the first primary debate. The &quot;LA Times&quot; wrote that Democratic voters were &quot;confused&quot; and &quot;transfixed&quot; by Williamson, who declared that her first act as president would be to call New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and say, &quot;Girlfriend, you are so on&quot;, a reference to Ardern&#x27;s emphasis on building a country that treats its children well. Williamson also received media attention for her closing remarks:In the closing moments of Thursday night’s Democratic debate, Marianne Williamson looked straight ahead and told the audience that her plan for her candidacy is to harness the country’s love. “Mr. President, if you’re listening,” she said, addressing Donald Trump directly, “you have harnessed fear for political purposes, and only love can cast that out. I am going to harness love for political purposes,” she continued, raising her eyebrows. “And sir, love will win.”

On July 30, Williamson participated in the second primary debate. She was the most Googled candidate in 49 of 50 states and received the fourth-most attention on X, then known as Twitter. The spike in searches was prompted by her reference to the Flint water crisis and her assertion that President Trump was harnessing a &quot;dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred,&quot; which she later described as racism, bigotry, antisemitism, homophobia, Islamophobia, and xenophobia propelled by social media.

On the day of the third DNC debate, for which she did not qualify, Williamson did an interview with Eric Bolling and expressed further frustration with the media when she thought she was not being recorded. Among her unscripted comments was &quot;what does it say that Fox News is nicer to me than the lefties are?&quot;

On January 10, 2020, Williamson announced the end of her campaign and pledged to support the Democratic nominee.

Many pundits treated Williamson&#x27;s brief campaign as comic relief, often characterizing her as a novelty candidate due to her unconventional approach and spiritual rhetoric. However, some found her message persuasive and influential. After the July 30, 2019, Democratic debate, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote, &quot;It feels insane to say this, but Williamson out-debated virtually everyone else on the stage. She gave a compelling answer on reparations and returned again and again to the most important issue for Democratic voters, beating Trump.&quot;

===2024 presidential campaign===
Williamson began &quot;working on putting a machine together&quot; to run for president in 2024, visiting South Carolina and New Hampshire in early 2023. On February 23, 2023, she confirmed that she would launch a run for president in the future. She started her 2024 campaign on March 4, 2023.

Williamson&#x27;s 2024 deputy campaign manager, Jason Call, departed from her team on May 20, 2023, a week after her campaign manager, Peter Daou, had announced similar intentions. The two gave substantially different reasons for their actions than did the campaign. Earlier in 2023, a dozen former staffers from her 2020 campaign, who remained anonymous due to having signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), described working for Williamson as &quot;toxic,&quot; &quot;traumatic,&quot; and &quot;terrifying&quot;. Williamson has been accused of throwing phones and shouting at staff so intensely they were reduced to tears. According to one account, her anger over logistics in South Carolina led her to strike a car repeatedly to the extent that she had to receive medical attention for a swollen hand. Williamson has denied the phone-throwing charge, admitted to the car incident, and acknowledged that she may have room for personal growth.

More staff left Williamson&#x27;s team in June 2023, including her new campaign manager.

In July 2023, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Williamson had contributed $220,000 to her own campaign and that the campaign&#x27;s most recent financial disclosure showed $270,000 in unpaid debts.

She received 4% of the votes in the New Hampshire primary. Following the New Hampshire primary, she held a volunteer Zoom meeting where she announced a tentative decision to drop out of the race, but after the call was leaked to the X account OrganizerMemes, she decided to stay in, but she dropped out after receiving only 2.1% of the vote in the South Carolina primary and 2.9% of the vote in the Nevada primary with no delegates. After the Michigan primary, Williamson decided to reenter the race when she received 3% of the vote.

Williamson received approximately 500,000 votes in the primary. 

Williamson ended her campaign on June 11, 2024. She re-entered the race on July 2, 2024. Williamson also expressed interest in an open convention after President Biden had announced he was dropping out of the race. On July 29, 2024, she ended her campaign for the final time.

===2025 Democratic National Committee chairmanship campaign===
On December 26, 2024, Williamson announced her candidacy in the election of the Democratic National Committee chairperson. On January 10, 2025, Williamson shared on X that the DNC Ethnic Council informed her that she would be excluded from their DNC candidate forum that day. Williamson responded with a letter to the DNC Ethnic Council denouncing her exclusion and said, &quot;This elitist choosing who is allowed to speak and who is not allowed to speak dishonors democratic principles and Democrats.&quot;

On February 1, 2025, Williamson endorsed frontrunner Ken Martin.

==Political positions==
=== Abortion rights ===
As a candidate for 2024 U.S. President, Williamson has stated her strong support for abortion access, services, and choice. She has spoken in favor of the abortion rights that were guaranteed under the now-overturned 1973 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. 

Williamson has shared her belief that it is good to expand women&#x27;s understanding of alternatives; however, eradicating or limiting women&#x27;s options would not reduce the number of terminations sought. Instead, it would result in wealthier women having access to safe abortions while poorer women face risks to their health. 

=== Black American reparations ===
Williamson supports the distribution of $200-$500 billion in reparations for slavery, spread across 20 years for &quot;economic and education projects&quot;, to be disbursed based on the recommendation of a selected group of black leaders.

=== Climate change and energy ===
Williamson deems climate change to be &quot;the greatest moral challenge of our generation.&quot; She claimed support for the Green New Deal, immediate re-entry into the Paris Climate Accords, and has stated that she would be willing to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership if it included greater protections for workers and the environment.

Williamson also supports the U.S. directing subsidies from fossil fuels, including coal, and re-investing them in the development of renewable energy, both in the U.S. and abroad, particularly in developing countries.

=== Gun control ===
Williamson supports gun control, and has described the issue as one personal to her. On November 4, 2018, she gave a keynote address to several hundred Muslim and Jewish women at the Sisterhood of Salaam-Shalom conference in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, eight days after 11 Jewish people were murdered the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. A Jewish woman, she argued against fear being used as a political force and advocated for love in its place.

=== Health care and vaccinations ===
Williamson supports universal health care under a &quot;Medicare for All type of plan&quot;. Williamson also supports independent regulation of the pharmaceutical industry to prevent what she has called &quot;predatory practices&quot;.

A &quot;both-and&quot; approach (both prayer and medicine) to physical and mental health has been attributed to Williamson. Williamson has said, &quot;People who are prayed for get out of the emergency room faster,&quot; and &quot;people who have been diagnosed with a life-challenging illness, who attend spiritual support groups, live, on average, twice as long after diagnosis&quot;.

Williamson has stated her support for the necessity and value of vaccinations and antidepressants, but has been criticized for her skepticism about the pharmaceutical industry&#x27;s influence in setting guidelines for how they are administered, citing her belief that their profit motive could result in harm to patients.

She has also criticized overprescription of antidepressants, questioning whether antidepressants play a role in suicide, saying that the prescriptive definition between sadness and clinical depression is &quot;artificial&quot;, and having called the process by which clinical depression is diagnosed &quot;a scam&quot;.

During Williamson&#x27;s presidential campaign, several excerpts of her past comments have conflated her skepticism of the pharmaceutical industry&#x27;s trustworthiness with an embrace of anti-vaccination dogma. As a result, she has been accused of being &quot;anti-medicine&quot; and &quot;anti-science&quot;. She denies such accusations, saying they &quot;could not be further from the truth.&quot; Williamson has expressed frustration that her skepticism of the pharmaceutical industry has been equated with skepticism of the science of vaccines. She has said, &quot;Skeptical about vaccinations I have not expressed. Skeptical about Big Pharma in general I have expressed. And there is a big difference.&quot;

=== Immigration ===
Williamson does not support open borders, but calls for what she describes as a more humane approach to border policy. In June 2019, Williamson criticized then-President Donald Trump on his immigration policies after reports of children being separated from their families and being put in a detainment center; she called these acts &quot;state-sponsored crimes&quot;. After Trump&#x27;s announcement that ICE would begin mass-deportations, she said it is &quot;no different&quot; than what Jewish people faced in Nazi Germany.

Williamson also supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and expanding protections and naturalization to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, regardless of their current age.

=== Other domestic issues ===
Williamson supports The Equality Act and an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, and has called religion a map in which &quot;the route isn&#x27;t important. It&#x27;s the destination that matters.&quot;

=== International relations and national security ===
Williamson supports the creation of a United States Department of Peace to aid in her proposed redesign, which also includes a plan to establish a Peace Academy modeled after military academies.

Williamson supports military engagement when a NATO ally is threatened, when the United States is under threat of attack, or &quot;when the humanitarian order of the world is at risk&quot;.

Williamson supported safe withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible and would consider the use of a peace-keeping force, such as the United Nations, to assist with the transition. Williamson has said she supports the U.S. vigorously using its position, i.e., through CFIUS, to prevent China from buying strategically important companies, which she believes will help defend U.S. economic interests and human rights, as in the cases of the Uighurs and residents of Hong Kong. Williamson supports rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Williamson criticized the Trump administration for elevating tensions with Iran. Williamson supports a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

==Public image==

Williamson has been referred to as a &quot;New Age guru&quot;. The label has been associated with her for years, but she has long rejected such terms, calling them &quot;outrageous&quot;. She has stated that she prefers to be called an author. “and ‘activist’ and has been called ‘populist adult educator’, and ‘philosopher’, and ‘mystic’, she has “always viewed things through a mystical lens,” Williamson told a crowd during her 2020 presidential campaign, and invoked the David and Goliath biblical story as her own (with her followers) saying “We’re going to get him [Donald Trump] right between the eyes...his third eye”; she also self-identifies as a ‘metaphysician’ and concluded once declaring about the American population that “We’re hallucinating...a mass hallucination” of a distorted reality.

In the context of her political campaigns, Williamson&#x27;s image has polarized many, with some praising her as authentic and eloquent, while others have criticized her for lacking seriousness. Her performance during the 2020 Democratic presidential debates received praise from a number of politicians, such as Democrats Jennifer Granholm and Ro Khanna, and media outlets like &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, for providing &quot;surprisingly eloquent&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; answers to questions on social issues. Others have criticized her responses, including a writer for &quot;Vox&quot; who called her answers &quot;extremely vague&quot; and &quot;deeply weird&quot;, and a writer for &quot;Salon&quot; who called her answers &quot;kooky&quot;. Williamson&#x27;s unorthodox style led to a large response across social media platforms such as Twitter, where she was the subject of various jokes and memes.

She made headlines when she criticized &quot;Vogue&quot; for its &quot;insidious influence&quot; when it did not include her in an Annie Leibovitz photo shoot of the 2020 female presidential candidates. The magazine responded that it only wanted &quot;to highlight the five female lawmakers who bring a collective 40 years of political experience to this race.&quot; Williamson subsequently posted a fan-made picture of the &quot;Vogue&quot; photo with herself edited in.

==Personal life and family==
Williamson&#x27;s older brother, Peter, became an immigration attorney like his father. Her late sister, Elizabeth &quot;Jane,&quot; was a teacher. Her father and her maternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. Her grandfather changed his surname from Vishnevetsky to Williamson after seeing &quot;Alan Williamson Ltd&quot; on a train. Williamson described herself as a &quot;Jewish woman&quot; in a 2022 interview.

She was briefly married in 1979 to a Houston businessman. She said the marriage lasted &quot;for a minute and a half&quot;.

In 1990, she gave birth to a daughter.

In 2006, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; poll named her one of the 50 most influential baby boomers.

In 2013, Williamson reported having assets estimated to be valued between $1 million and $5 million (not including personal residences).

, Williamson lives in Washington, D.C.

==Charity work==

Since the 1980s, Williamson has operated charities based on the principles of the &quot;Course&quot;.

===Centers for Living===
In 1987, inspired by a friend&#x27;s struggle with breast cancer, Williamson launched the Center for Living, after a $50,000 donation from David Geffen. Williamson co-founded the organization with Louise Hay—a minister of the New Thought Church of Religious Science—who claimed to have healed herself of cancer.

The Center primarily assists people afflicted with HIV/AIDS, particularly gay men, who were openly welcomed when shunned and refused help by other organizations. The Center provided services such as housework, daily chores, meditation, massage, psychological counseling, and emotional support throughout the city and county of Los Angeles.

In 1989, having received another advance of $50,000 (~$ in ) from Geffen, Williamson opened a second Center for Living, this time in New York City; this location was hampered by a conflict between staff and the board regarding Williamson&#x27;s management style, which an anonymous former associate described as &quot;very controlling&quot;.

Unlike in Los Angeles, the more secular New York had requested for Williamson not to pray, fueling a further disconnect.

A few months later, after two of Williamson&#x27;s board members told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that she wanted &quot;to be famous,&quot; Williamson felt that she was being treated as &quot;expendable&quot;. This notion would lead to the expulsion of several of her board members, including the then-head of the New York Center, as well as of film director Mike Nichols.

Williamson stepped down from her role at the Centers in the summer of 1992. The New York Center was able to remain open, following a donation from Cher. Williamson gave the organization an extra $50,000 check and left, but remained an advisor to the organization. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Williamson was &quot;losing trust&quot; in several board members and &quot;preemptively&quot; fired them before her own potential downfall. She disputed this, claiming that she intended to &quot;step down as President,&quot; wishing to provide her successor with a &quot;clean slate&quot;.

===Project Angel Food===
In 1989, with the Centers&#x27; success, Williamson launched Project Angel Food (a program operated by The Centers for Living) to support HIV/AIDS patients. By 1992, it had raised over $1.5 million and was delivering nearly 400 hot meals a day to homebound AIDS patients in Los Angeles.

Williamson resigned from Project Angel Food in March 1992. Employees demanded the resignation of Williamson, reinstatement of her predecessor, and a replacement of the board, threatening unionization if Williamson did not resign. Stephen Bennett, a consultant hired to assess the situation, determined that there were more paid staff on hand than needed, but with a union vote pending, Bennett refused to lay employees off.

Project Angel Food struggled for a time following Williamson&#x27;s departure (Williamson had been the primary fundraiser) but remained operational. By 1998 it had over 1,500 volunteers and nearly 1,000 clients. As of 2018, with expanded food, nutrition and counseling services, it delivered 12,000 meals weekly throughout Los Angeles. As of 2019, Williamson remains a trustee of the organization.

====AIDS work====
Williamson has helped gay men who she said &quot;were told that they weren&#x27;t loved by their family and friends, employers, politicians, hospitals.&quot; She has officiated at funerals, driven men to their doctors, and paid for patients&#x27; AIDS medication.

During her 2020 presidential campaign, Williamson was accused of telling gay men not to take medication for AIDS, of implying that they were &quot;not positive enough&quot; to counter the disease, of telling them that they &quot;deserved&quot; the disease, and of telling them to &quot;pray the AIDS away.&quot; She has repeatedly denied these accusations. Most of the accusations appeared to stem from excerpts or paraphrases of her 1992 book &quot;A Return to Love&quot;.

===The Peace Alliance===

In 1998, Williamson co-founded the non-profit Global Renaissance Alliance (GSA) with &quot;Conversations with God&quot; author Neale Donald Walsch. The organization established a network of &quot;citizen salons&quot; to pray for national growth, peace and liberal causes. According to Williamson, the GSA sat in small &quot;Peace Circles&quot; of fewer than 12 people every other week and prayed together.

In 2004, the GSA&#x27;s name was changed to The Peace Alliance and was given a new mandate focused on grassroots education and advocacy organization. The intended purpose was to increase U.S. government support for peace-building approaches to domestic and international conflicts. The Peace Alliance advocated for lobbying congressional representatives directly.

===&quot;Sister Giant&quot; conferences===
In 2010, Williamson launched &quot;Sister Giant&quot;, a series of conferences to &quot;start a new conversation about transformational politics&quot; and encourage more women to run for office:

In 2012, Yale University&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Campaign Schoolan independent, nonpartisan, issue-neutral political campaign training and leadership program hosted at Yale Law Schoolpartnered with the series, which focused on how to better address social issues like child poverty, campaign finance reform, and high incarceration rates.

===RESULTS===
For several years until 2017, Williamson was a board member of Results Educational Fund (RESULTS), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity dedicated to finding long-term solutions to poverty by focusing on its root causes, and its sister organization, Results Inc., a 501(c)(4) &quot;social welfare&quot; organization that encourages &quot;grassroots advocates to lobby their elected officials&quot; and works &quot;directly with Congress and other U.S. policymakers to shape and advance&quot; anti-poverty policies. The organization has 100 local chapters in the U.S. and is active in six other countries.

== Biographies and Critics ==
The biographical and critical works on Marianne Williamson and her work are numerous. Oumano (1992) published the first, and primarily positive biography on Williamson. Fisher (2021) published the first scholarly and journalistic analysis in an intellectual biography of Williamson, where he brings out extensive critiques and recommendations for improving Williamson’s leadership style and approach to activist organizing and political campaigns. A critical discussion of Marianne Williamson’s approach to the presidency campaign and her philosophy in the current context of politics appeared on the podcast site called Integral Stage in 2023. There have been in the last couple years a few other less extensive biographical works on Williamson. They tend to all be, more or less, Williamson fan-based works. 

Currently, the Wikipedia page here on Marianne Williamson is lacking in referencing the number of scholarly articles and quality journal articles that offer criticism and critique beginning in the 1990s.

<text>Metroland is a 1997 British comedy-drama film directed by Philip Saville and starring Christian Bale and Emily Watson. Written by Adrian Hodges, based on the 1980 novel &quot;Metroland&quot; by Julian Barnes, the film is about a man whose tranquil and ordinary life is disrupted by the sudden reappearance of his best friend, which leads him to remember his rebellious youth in Paris, to question some of his life choices, and to re-evaluate his priorities and marriage.

==Plot==
In 1977, Chris (Christian Bale) and Marion (Emily Watson) are leading a peaceful married life with their child in Eastwood in the London suburbs known as Metroland, the staid commuter region at the end of the London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan Line. Their stagnant life is disrupted by an early morning phone call from Chris&#x27;s childhood friend Toni (Lee Ross), who has returned to England after several years of travelling through Africa, Europe, and the United States as a bohemian poet. Years before, the two shared a dream of escaping boring suburban existence to live in avant-garde splendor in Paris. Toni&#x27;s return sparks memories in Chris about their wild days in Paris in the late 1960s.

Disillusioned with the life he&#x27;s chosen—having abandoned his youthful passion for photography for a steady job as a London banker—Chris takes long walks at night, making lists in his head of things for which he should feel grateful. Feeling that something is missing in his life, Chris sees in Toni the person he could have become—a free spirit living a vagabond&#x27;s existence without worries or responsibilities. Toni outspokenly criticises Chris for his acceptance of a middle class life, a mortgage and a nine-to-five job. One night, Chris goes to a punk rock club with Toni who gets him stoned on cannabis. Envious of his friend, Chris begs Toni to reveal his secret for happiness and Toni responds that it&#x27;s doing what you want, not what others want.

With his dull and tranquil marriage, Chris increasingly obsesses on the past. He rediscovers naked pictures of his former French girlfriend, Annick (Elsa Zylberstein), and in the coming days he thinks back to 1968 when they were in Paris. He remembers taking on the persona of a French beatnik with a hatred for all things English. His French fantasy was interrupted when he met Marion, who was holidaying in Paris with some friends. Taken aback by this educated and strait-laced Englishwoman, Chris began spending time with her, telling her about Annick and his conflicting feelings towards England. Unimpressed with his unrealistic dreams, Marion informed him that eventually he would get married because he was &quot;not original enough&quot; to avoid marriage and a conventional future. When Annick learned about his friendship with the Englishwoman, she broke off their relationship.

Back in the present, Chris is unable to get over the feeling that he has surrendered his youth and ideals to a life he once swore he would never lead. One night he attends a party at Toni&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s house, arriving without his wife. There he hears Toni casually mentioning that his girlfriend just had an abortion, and then sees him flirting with another woman at the party—doing what he wants to do. Later, Chris meets a beautiful woman, Joanna (Amanda Ryan), who invites him to sleep with her. After learning that Toni in fact asked her to sleep with his friend as a way of ruining his marriage, Chris rejects the offer and returns home to Marion.

The next day, Chris comes home from work and finds Toni in the house with Marion. Toni hints that he and Marion had sex and the two friends get into a fight in the garden. Later, Marion tells him that Toni tried it on and that she rejected him. She tells him that despite all of his talk, Toni is really only jealous of Chris and the life he leads. The next day, Toni shows up at Chris&#x27; house to say goodbye before headed to Malibu, where he intends to do some screenwriting. He tries to tempt Chris into leaving his life behind and come with him but Chris refuses, admitting, &quot;I like my life; I&#x27;m content&quot;. That night, while Chris is on one of his walks, Marion approaches and asks what he would put on the list for &quot;happy&quot;. Chris responds, &quot;Happy—if not now, never&quot;.

==Production==
===Theme===
&quot;Metroland&quot; explores the tension between the youthful idealism of a hedonistic existence and that of middle-class establishment. The film title refers to the London suburbs which are served by the expansive London Underground network, an environment that Chris and Toni had always promised themselves they would escape. The narrative format is largely the flashback, with extended portions showing Chris as a 21-year-old living in Paris.

===Screenplay===
The screenplay was written by Adrian Hodges, based on the novel &quot;Metroland&quot; by Julian Barnes. The primary difference between film and the novel is the narrative structure: the book proceeds chronologically from Chris&#x27; youth to the early years of his marriage; the film uses flashbacks to his time in Paris. In the book, Chris is a post-graduate student while in Paris; in the film, he is a photographer. Finally, in the book, Chris&#x27; encounter with another woman at a party was not arranged by Toni, nor is there any indication that Toni has made a pass at Chris&#x27; wife Marion. Much of the dialogue from the book is preserved in the film.

===Filming locations===
&quot;Metroland&quot; was filmed on location in Amersham, London and Uxbridge in England and in Paris. Studio filming was done at Twickenham Film Studios in Middlesex, England.

===Soundtrack===
Mark Knopfler wrote the score and produced the &quot;Metroland&quot; soundtrack, which is supplemented by some additional tracks appropriate to the period depicted in the film.

The executive producer Andrew Bendel and director Philip Saville needed three songs from the punk era to be included in the live band scenes played by a fictitious group called The Subverts. Danny de Matos and Del Bartle were asked to write the songs to be included in the film. These three particular songs featured in the film (although not included on the Polygram soundtrack) &quot;Amerikkka We Hate You&quot;, &quot;Destroy the Hoi Polloi&quot; and &quot;You Destiny&quot; were also produced by Danny de Matos.

==Reception==
In his review for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, David Rooney called the film &quot;sexy and entertaining&quot; with a &quot;witty script and strong performances&quot;. Rooney concluded:
In his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A− score, calling it &quot;a no-fuss movie that casts a rich, tranquil spell.&quot; Gleiberman concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s the rare portrait of a happy marriage that is honest about the complex currents of desire, and the drama is beautifully played by Bale, who gawks with soulful sweetness, and Watson, who does her most piercing work since Breaking the Waves.&quot;

In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, noting director Philip Saville ability to tell this &quot;straightforward story of life choices&quot; while avoiding a dependence on sentiment. Commenting on the lead character&#x27;s memories of his past and his choices, Ebert writes:
Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Metroland&quot; a rating of 62% from 29 reviews.

The film grossed $82,660 in the United Kingdom and $26,682 in the United States.

<text>Ada Programming Support Environment or APSE, was a specification for a programming environment to support software development in the Ada programming language. This represented the second stage of the U.S. military Ada project; once the language was implemented, it was felt necessary to specify and implement a standard set of tools, hence the APSE. CAIS-A, Common APSE Interface Set A, was defined in MIL STD-1838A.

CAIS defines a set of Ada APIs to enable portability of development tools across operating systems. As of 1988, CAIS implementations were developed for Unix, VMS and IBM MVS.

<text>Elizabeth Mary Furness (January 3, 1916 – April 2, 1994) was an American actress, consumer advocate, and current affairs commentator.

==Early years==
Furness was born in Manhattan, the daughter of wealthy business executive George Choate Furness and his wife Florence. She attended the Brearley School and Bennett Junior College.

== Acting career ==
Furness made her stage debut in the school holidays in the title role of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. She also posed for commercial advertising. She began her professional career as a model before being noticed by a talent scout and being signed to a film contract in 1932 by RKO Studios. Her first film role was as the &quot;Thirteenth Woman&quot; in the film &quot;Thirteen Women&quot; (1932) but her scenes were deleted before the film&#x27;s release.

Over the next few years, she appeared in several RKO films, and became a popular actress. Among her film successes were &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1935) and the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936). By the end of the decade, she had appeared in over forty films, but during the 1940s, she found it difficult to secure acting roles.

==Career==

In 1948, Furness was performing in the television series &quot;Studio One&quot;, which was broadcast live. She filled in for an actor to promote Westinghouse products during the advertisement break, and impressed the company with her easy and professional manner. They offered her a contract to promote their products and she thus became closely associated with them.

Early television commercials often utilized radio performers who had a difficult time adjusting to the visual medium of TV, leading to sometimes embarrassing incidents such as a Westinghouse commercial where a woman demonstrating an electric stove spilled hot chocolate all over it. Furness, due to her experience at &quot;Studio One&quot;, felt that she could do a better job. An advertising agency offered her a shot, and she found that she had a natural talent for commercials. Making $150 a week at first, Furness did three Westinghouse commercials (they were the sole sponsor of the show) for every episode of &quot;Studio One&quot;, all of them shot live, since videotape did not yet exist. (One live spot featured a refrigerator door that refused to open, causing one of the most famous bloopers in TV history; however, this was not Furness, but actress June Graham, who was substituting for her. For decades, Furness was &quot;credited&quot; for the blooper, until she set the record straight in the 1981 TV special &quot;TV&#x27;s Censored Bloopers&quot;.)

Furness proved a successful spokeswoman because of her good looks and attractive, but neat and modest clothing, which she changed three times a day. She also proved strongly independent-minded about her appearance and image, refusing to adopt a stage name or wear an apron after Westinghouse offered these suggestions. She did however agree to wear a wedding ring on camera to appear more like a housewife. Furness also purchased all of her clothing herself, not wanting Westinghouse to decide her appearance for her. During the political party conventions in the 1952 presidential election, the television coverage of which was heavily sponsored by Westinghouse, Furness wore 28 different outfits, enough to become the subject of a &quot;Life&quot; story.

Furness&#x27;s contract with Westinghouse eventually resulted in her receiving an annual salary of $100,000 and her advertisements caused sales of the company&#x27;s appliances to soar, with the one notable exception of the dishwasher, which proved a hard sell after market research found that American women were reluctant to buy a device that would in effect completely automate their kitchen and give them nothing to do.

One of television&#x27;s most recognizable series of commercials had Furness opening wide a refrigerator door, intoning, &quot;You can be sure ... if it&#x27;s Westinghouse.&quot; (The spots were so well known they were often parodied: one &quot;Mad&quot; magazine gag imagined the words on a neon sign, with a few key letters burned out: YOU CAN ..SU.E IF IT&#x27;S WESTINGHOUSE!&quot;)

Furness hosted ABC&#x27;s &quot;Penthouse Party&quot; which ran for 39 episodes from September 1950 to June 1951. Furness was a regular panelist on the CBS panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1951. She appeared in a series of live mysteries on ABC, under the weighty title &quot;Your Kaiser Dealer Presents Kaiser-Frazer &quot;Adventures In Mystery&quot; Starring Betty Furness In &quot;Byline&quot;&quot; which ran in November and December 1951, and again on ABC in syndication in the fall of 1957. The series was produced by the DuMont Television Network and ran on DuMont under the title &quot;News Gal&quot;.

From January 1, 1953 through July 3, 1953, she appeared in her own daytime television series &quot;Meet Betty Furness&quot;, which was sponsored by Westinghouse. The quarter-hour talk program was broadcast on Friday mornings on CBS. In 1959, a new Westinghouse president decided to drop Furness, possibly because he wished to impose his own ideas on the company, and suggested getting a new, slightly younger spokeswoman. Despite some resistance from the company marketing department, he won out and Furness was released from her contract at the end of 1960. Her final spots for Westinghouse were seen within the CBS News coverage of the July 1960 Los Angeles Democratic Convention, the August 1960 Chicago Republican Convention and the evening of November 8 election returns. She then attempted to move into a less commercialized role in television, but found herself too closely associated with advertising to be taken seriously. During this time, she worked on radio and also on behalf of the Democratic Party.

Furness has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for her contribution to motion pictures at 1533 Vine Street and for her contribution to television at 6675 Hollywood Blvd.

==Consumer advocacy==
In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson, aware of her work for the Democratic Party, contacted Furness and offered her the position of Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs. She accepted the assignment and continued in this role until the end of the Johnson administration in 1969. During her tenure she silenced her critics by applying herself studiously to her role and learning the issues relating to consumer rights. From 1969 until 1993 she served as a board member for Consumers Union, publisher of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;. She was appointed by then-Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller in August 1970 to serve as the first chairman and executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, and served in the position until July 1971 before returning to television. In 1971, Furness was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. In 1973 she also headed the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.

Signed by WNBC in New York, Furness reported on consumer issues, and specifically targeted examples of consumer fraud. In 1976 she began an association with The &quot;Today&quot; Show filling in as anchor following the departure of Barbara Walters and providing regular reports. In 1977 her program &quot;&quot; won the Peabody Award.

==Personal life==
Furness married four times. Her first marriage was to composer-conductor Johnny Green in 1937, with whom she had one child. After her divorce from Green in 1943, she married radio announcer Hugh &quot;Bud&quot; Ernst Jr. twice - first in 1945, and again in 1946. Her second marriage to him lasted until his death in 1950 when, depressed over the breakup of their marriage, he shot himself after phoning a New York newspaper and declaring, &quot;If you want a good story, come and get it&quot;. She married again in 1967 to Leslie Midgley, who survived her. Liza Snyder, from the CBS Television series &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; and &quot;Man with a Plan&quot; is her granddaughter. 

In 1990, Furness was treated for stomach cancer, and cut down her schedule on &quot;The Today Show&quot; to four days. NBC used this as an excuse to fire her two years later, along with a network decision to change their consumer reporting to a more tabloid-style format. Furness was not happy with her termination and cited it as an example of age discrimination. She expressed her desire to continue working, but a recurrence of stomach cancer prevented her from doing so.

Furness expressed her philosophy of never declining a job, and she believed it was the reason that she progressed through such an unconventional series of professions. During her illness, she stated that she wanted nothing more than to be able to work, and mentioned in an interview that, as far as her cancer went, &quot;the treatment is worse than the disease.&quot; Her health continued to deteriorate until her death from stomach cancer on April 2, 1994, at age 78 in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

<text>Cairo was the codename for a project at Microsoft from 1991 to 1996. Its charter was to build technologies for a next-generation operating system that would fulfill Bill Gates&#x27;s vision of &quot;information at your fingertips.&quot; Cairo never shipped, although portions of its technologies have since appeared in other products.

==Overview==
Cairo was announced at the 1991 Microsoft Professional Developers Conference by Jim Allchin. It was demonstrated publicly (including a demo system for all attendees to use) at the 1993 Cairo/Win95 PDC. Microsoft changed stance on Cairo several times, sometimes calling it a product, other times referring to it as a collection of technologies.

==Features==
Cairo used distributed computing concepts to make information available quickly and seamlessly across a worldwide network of computers.

The Windows 95 user interface was based on the initial design work that was done on the Cairo user interface. DCE/RPC shipped in Windows NT 3.1. Content Indexing is now a part of Internet Information Server and Windows Desktop Search.

The remaining component is the object file system. It was once planned to be implemented in the form of WinFS as part of Windows Vista but development was cancelled in June 2006, with some of its technologies merged into other Microsoft products such as Microsoft SQL Server 2008, also known under the codename &quot;Katmai&quot;.

<doc id="1064216" wikidata="Q1640726" url="?curid=1064216" title="National Technical University of Athens">
<text>The National (Metsovian) Technical University of Athens (NTUA; , &quot;National Metsovian Polytechnic&quot;), sometimes known as Athens Polytechnic, a university in Athens, Greece. It is named in honor of its benefactors Nikolaos Stournaris, Eleni Tositsa, Michail Tositsas and Georgios Averoff, whose origin is from the town of Metsovo in Epirus.

It was founded in 1837 as a part-time vocational school named Royal School of Arts which, as its role in the technical development of the fledgling state grew, developed into Greece&#x27;s sole institution providing engineering degrees up until the 1950s, when polytechnics were established outside Athens. Its traditional campus, located in the center of Athens on Patission Avenue on a site donated by Eleni Tositsa, features a suite of magnificent neoclassical buildings by architect Lysandros Kaftantzoglou (1811–1885). A new campus, the Zografou Campus, was built in the 1980s.

NTUA is divided into nine academic schools, eight being for the engineering disciplines, including architecture, and one for applied sciences (mathematics and physics). Undergraduate studies have a duration of five years. 

The university comprises about 700 of academic staff, 140 scientific assistants and 260 administrative and technical staff. It also has about 8,500 undergraduates and about 1,500 postgraduate students. Eight of the NTUA&#x27;s Schools are housed at the Zografou Campus, while the School of Architecture is based at the Patission Complex.

==History==
NTUA was established by royal decree on December 31, 1836 (OS), January 21, 1837 (NS), under the name &quot;Royal School of Arts&quot; (). It began functioning as a part-time vocational school (only Sundays and holidays) to train craftsmen, builders and master craftsmen to cover the needs of the new Greek state. In 1840, due to its increasing popularity and the changing socio-economic conditions in the new state, NTUA was upgraded to a full time technical school which worked alongside the Sunday school. Courses were expanded and the institution was housed in its own building on Pireos Street.

===The restructuring===
In 1843 a major restructuring was made. Three departments were created:

* &quot;Part-Time Vocational School&quot;
* &quot;Daily School&quot;
* A new &quot;Higher School of Fine Arts&quot;

The new department&#x27;s object was fine arts and engineering. The new department, which was later renamed &quot;School of Industrial and Fine Arts&quot;, rapidly evolved towards a major higher education institution. Tradition has it that &quot;arts&quot; referred to both technical professions and fine arts. Even today, the school maintains a school of architecture that is closely related to the School of Fine Arts, which later evolved to become a separate school.

The name &quot;Polytechnnic&quot; came in 1862, with the introduction of several new technical courses. This restructuring continued steadily until 1873. At the time, the school became overwhelmed by the plethora of students wishing to learn higher technical skills. This led to its move to a new campus.

===The relocation===

In 1873 it moved to its new campus in Patission Street and was known as &quot;Metsovion Polytechnion&quot; (Metsovian Polytechnic) after the birthplace of the benefactors who financed construction of this campus. Though the Patission Street campus was incomplete at the time, rising student demand made it urgent to relocate.

In 1887, the institution was partitioned into three technical schools: Structural Engineering, Architecture and Mechanical Engineering — all four-year degrees at the time. It was at this point that the institute was recognized as a technical education facility by the state — a crucial step in its development — as it became adapted to the nation’s developmental needs.

In 1914, new schools were created and was officially named &quot;Ethnicon Metsovion Polytechnion&quot; (National Metsovian Polytechnic) went under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works. This is when new technical schools started to be formed, a process that was completed three years later, in 1917, when the NTUA changed form. By special law, the old &quot;School of Industrial Arts&quot; was now separated into the Higher Schools of &quot;Civil Engineering&quot;, &quot;Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering&quot;, &quot;Chemical Engineering&quot;, &quot;Surveying Engineering&quot; and &quot;Architecture&quot;. Later, the schools of &quot;Naval Engineering&quot;, and &quot;Mining and Metallurgical Engineering&quot; were formed, and the school of &quot;Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering&quot; was split up into two separate schools, &quot;Mechanical Engineering&quot; and &quot;Electrical and Computer Engineering&quot;, which is almost the form of schools maintained until now.

In 1923, the NTUA alumni formed the core of the Technical Chamber of Greece, the professional organization that serves as the official technical adviser of the Greek state and is responsible for awarding professional licenses to all practicing engineers in Greece.

In 1930, the Athens School of Fine Arts was established, acquiring its independence from the NTUA, as a school exclusively focused in the teaching the fine arts. This allowed the two schools to develop separately as a technical and an arts school respectively.

In 1941 to 1944, the National Technical University of Athens played an important role in the country&#x27;s political life with the Greek students participating in the National Resistance under the German occupation. During the Axis occupation of Greece, NTUA, in addition to its function as an academic institution, became one of the most active resistance centers in Athens.

===The uprising===
The Polytechnion Uprising of November, 1973, marked a turning point in Greece&#x27;s struggle against the military dictatorship that had seized power in 1967. This historic event, which began with student protests at NTUA, culminated in a brutal crackdown by the regime.

The uprising was ignited by a series of student demonstrations and occupations, each met with increasing violence from the authorities. The final confrontation began on November 14th, when students barricaded themselves inside NTUA&#x27;s Patission Complex and began broadcasting a pirate radio station, calling for popular rebellion.

On November 17th, the military regime used army tanks to break through the gates and unleash a wave of violence against the students and their supporters. The toll of the Polytechnion uprising was tragic. Several demonstrators were killed; many more were arrested by the military police and were tortured for months in military prisons. The uprising galvanized the Greek people and the junta was irreparably damaged by the popular outcry (it fell in 1974, after the Turkish invasion in Cyprus).

The Polytechnion Uprising is commemorated annually on November 17th by students, political parties, and the Greek government as a symbol of the struggle for freedom, democracy, and social justice. A monument created by Memos Makris and erected at the NTUA campus honors the victims of the uprising and serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought against tyranny.

==Emblem==

The emblem of the NTUA features Prometheus bringing the fire from the gods to the mankind. In Greek mythology, Prometheus defied the Olympian gods by giving fire to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge and, more generally, civilization. This emblem underscores NTUA&#x27;s commitment to addressing real human needs and dimensions.

The emblem is round and black. It features Prometheus in the center holding a lit torch with his right hand. To the right is an altar with a flame on top and the name &quot;Prometheus the Fire-bringer (&quot;Pyrphoros&quot;) inscribed on the sides. On the left side of the emblem, the name &quot;ΕΘΝ • ΜΕΤΣΟΒ • ΠΟΛΥΤΕΧΝΕΙΟΝ&quot; is written in capital letters, along with the year NTUA was established in Greek numerals (i.e., ).

The emblem was designed in 1954 by the greek artist Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas, who also served as Professor of Drawing until 1958. His original sketches for the emblem are part of the Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas collection of the Benaki Museum.

===Studies===

====Undergraduate studies====
The academic calendar of NTUA comprises 10 independent, integral academic semesters. Each semester lasts 18 weeks: 13 weeks of classes, a two-week break (Christmas and Easter holidays for the fall and spring semester respectively), and three weeks of semester exams. The tenth semester is devoted to the preparation of the diploma thesis. The diploma thesis has to be related to one of the courses of the faculty. The student has at his or her disposal at least a full academic semester to prepare the thesis. Upon completion of the thesis, the student must take part in an oral examination that can take place either in June, October or February, after the final examinations, provided that the student has passed all courses prescribed by the curriculum.

An important part of the studies in NTUA are the summer &quot;training&quot; projects which take place in Industrial and Production Units, in the period between the end of the spring semester and the beginning of the fall semester. They constitute an elective course for the Faculties of Civil Engineering, Survey Engineering (Surveying and Geodesy Camp) and Mining and Metallurgy Engineering (Mining Camp) and are partially subsidized by the European Union.

====Postgraduate studies====
There are currently 20 departmental or inter-departmental postgraduate courses, coordinated by NTUA Departments, leading to the respective Post Graduate Specialization Diploma, with a minimum duration of 17 months, including one in Business Administration (in collaboration with the Athens University of Economics and Business). Moreover, NTUA participates in nine post-graduate programs coordinated by other Greek Universities. After the acquisition of the Post Graduate Specialization Diploma, the student can proceed towards submitting a doctoral thesis.

===Academic staff===

==Research and innovation==
NTUA boasts high research activity, as research and education are both its goals. Research is managed by administrative and education personnel, but can be conducted by graduate and sometimes undergraduate students as well. Research is administered by five separate offices:
# The Special Accounting for Research Office (ΕΛΚΕ)
# The Liaison Office 
# The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Unit 
# The Internship Programme 
# The Office of Researchers
# The Interdisciplinary Research Center
# The Interdisciplinary Unit for Reusable Energy

Research is funded by the NTUA endowment, or often directly through public or private funds.

===Ranking===
The National Technical university of Athens is one of Greece&#x27;s top universities. In 2025, the QS World University Rankings (WUR) ranked NTUA #321, with the corresponding faculty area rank being #142 for Engineering &amp; Technology. In Europe, NTUA secured the #180 spot.

During 2022, 130 researchers from NTUA were included among the top-cited scientists (top 2%).

===Academic evaluation===
Between October 2015 and July 2016, the Hellenic Authority for Higher Education (HEHA) carried out the external evaluation of all Greek institutions of higher education. The final external evaluation report for NTUA was submitted by the experts in November 2016. The report stresses that NTUA is well-organized and boasts an outstanding reputation due to its students and faculty, who have significantly contributed to Greek science and technology. The leadership has clear academic, administrative, and research goals, and strategic initiatives to address both strengths and weaknesses. Challenges include adapting to changes in higher education, legal obstacles, and staff alignment. The university has a broad and diverse range of subjects, strong industry links, and a commitment to quality assurance, but faces issues like state intervention, funding inadequacies, and the need for better external stakeholder engagement and internal services.

==Campus==

===Patission Complex===

The Averof building is one of the most important and elegant buildings of the Athenian Neoclassical period located in the center of Athens and the most important work of architect Lysandros Kaftanzoglou. It constitutes also one of the most important creations of European Neoclassicism, directly influenced in its design by the monuments of the Athenian Acropolis. Its construction began in 1862 and ended in 1878. After its completion, the building was in continuous use for more than 125 years during which it suffered from several additions and alterations. The main building has housed at times the National Gallery and various exhibitions of Schliemann&#x27;s archaeological findings and relics of the 1821 Greek revolution.

The Averof building reached a deteriorating state and was eventually in great need of restoration and modernization in order to continue operating as an educational establishment. The aim of the conservation project, namely for the Averof to be used again as an educational building, was successfully achieved after the building became operative in the beginning of 2010 and won the grand prize of Europa Nostra in 2012.

===Zografou Campus===

The main campus is located in the Zografou area of the Athens metropolitan area, housing all the schools of NTUA except architecture, which remains in its traditional location on the Patission Avenue for historical reasons. The main campus spreads over an area of about 190 acres, 6 km from the center of Athens. It includes buildings of 65 acres with fully equipped lecture theaters, laboratories, libraries, gyms, a central library, a computer center and a medical center.

The School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences is housed in the center of the campus. Right next to it is the Mining and Metallurgical Engineering School. The Civil Engineering School and the Rural and Surveying Engineering School are both housed on the south-west near the Zografou Gate. Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Naval Engineering, and the new Electrical Engineering School are all housed near the middle of the campus, while the old electrical engineering buildings remain on the north-east.

====Transportation====
There are in-campus roads making all buildings accessible by bicycle and car. There are also various internal buses that allow for transportation within the facilities, driving around the perimeter of the campus and through eight different bus stops. The campus is accessible through three main gates: the Katechaki and Kokkinopoulou Gates on the north, and the Zografou Gate on the west. There are 2,000 dedicated parking spots scattered throughout the campus, most nearby all major buildings. The campus resides near the metro station of Katechaki, which makes it accessible within minutes from any area of Athens. Furthermore, six different buses are available for transportation from various city locations to the campus: the 608 from Galatsi, 230 from Acropolis, 242 from the Katechaki Metro station and 140 from Glifada.

====Central Library====

On the campus lies the NTUA Central Library, which has operated since 1914, and was the first library in Greece with a complete index. Today, it remains one of the largest technical libraries in the country, featuring a collection of over 215,000 books and 100,000 scientific issues. The library is available to the public at all times for studying, and available to students, faculty, and internal and external researchers for borrowing.

The central library building at Zografou campus houses also the historical library of NTUA as a special collection. This scientific-technical library is unique in Greece, and one of the most important in Europe, since it contains approximately 60,000 volumes and periodicals (1,096 titles) issued from the 17th century until 1950. The main bulk of NTUA&#x27;s historical collection consists of old and rare books, pamphlets, maps, engravings and encyclopedias.

<text>Peter Conradi is a British author and journalist who is the Europe Editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London.

==Biography==
Conradi is the author of &quot;The Red Ripper: Inside the Mind of Russia&#x27;s Most Brutal Serial Killer&quot; (about Andrei Chikatilo); &quot;Mad Vlad: Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the New Russian Nationalism&quot; (about Vladimir Zhirinovsky) and &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Piano Player&quot; (about Ernst Hanfstaengl a.k.a. Putzi). &quot;The Independent&quot; called &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Piano Player&quot; &quot;an exemplary piece of biographical writing&quot;.

He is co-author with Mark Logue of the best-selling book &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy&quot;, which tells the story of the friendship between King George VI and his Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue, that inspired the highly acclaimed film of the same name. He is also author of &quot;Royale Europe&quot;, a book about Europe&#x27;s reigning royal families, which was published initially in French in May 2011.

A graduate of the University of Oxford (Brasenose College), Conradi also studied at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He was a foreign correspondent based in Brussels, Zurich, and Moscow, and became deputy foreign editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London in 1998. He was appointed editor of &quot;Home&quot;, the newspaper&#x27;s property supplement, in April 2006 and subsequently &quot;Focus&quot; editor. He was appointed as the newspaper&#x27;s foreign editor, succeeding Sean Ryan, in July 2013. In September 2018 he was named European editor for the Sunday Times and Times. 

His book about politics between Russia and the United States, &quot;Who Lost Russia?&quot;, was described by Owen Matthews in the &quot;Literary Review&quot; as &#x27;fast-paced, comprehensive, solidly researched and, most importantly, essential reading for anyone who wants to understand one of the great crises of our times.&#x27;

He has three children and lives in Paris.

He then attended Runshaw College between 1985 and 1987, studying for four A-levels, including theatre studies. He was described as &quot;clearly [having] a talent for comedy&quot;.

Following this, he turned down a scholarship in America, to study drama at Manchester Polytechnic instead.

==Career==

===Comedy and television===
While at university, Thomson met Steve Coogan, who secured him a job on &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. They continued to collaborate on such programmes as &quot;The Dead Good Show&quot;, a 1993 Granada TV pilot also starring Caroline Aherne, &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot;, the Paul and Pauline Calf video diaries (in which he played Fat Bob) and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge&quot;, for which he also wrote. He also appeared in Coogan&#x27;s live shows as compère Bernard Righton and the two would be reunited in the 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. The two won the Perrier Comedy Award in 1992 for their act at the Edinburgh Fringe.

Thomson also played supporting roles in the first series of the Stewart Lee and Richard Herring vehicle, &quot;Fist of Fun&quot;.

In 1994, Thomson appeared in the BBC sketch series &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, remaining with it until it ended in 2001. Thomson played memorable characters such as Chip Cobb, the deaf stuntman, and Roger the Nouveau football fan, but it is as &quot;Jazz Club&quot; host Louis Balfour that he is most remembered, with the catchphrase, &quot;Nice!&quot; He also appeared in &quot;The Fast Show Live&quot; and the spin-off &quot;Ted and Ralph&quot;.

In 1996, he appeared opposite Maureen Lipman as Bob Acres in &quot;The Rivals&quot; at the Royal Exchange, Manchester.

He made guest appearances on various series such as Coronation Street, &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot; and &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; in the 1990s before being cast as Pete Gifford in the ITV comedy drama &quot;Cold Feet&quot;. Thomson was known to the producers, who had previously cast him in a one-off drama called &quot;The Perfect Match&quot;. A series was commissioned that ran until 2003 and earned him a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actor at the British Comedy Awards 2001. Granada Television filmed a comedy drama called &quot;Stan the Man&quot; in 2002 in which Thomson starred as Stanley Tully a would-be entrepreneur. Some of the filming was done in south Manchester suburbs.

After &quot;Cold Feet&quot; wrapped, Thomson appeared in the Royal Exchange&#x27;s production of &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (helped by his acclaimed performance in &quot;The Rivals&quot;). &quot;The Independent&quot; described his performance as Willie as &quot;an extremely well-judged performance. With the slightest physical gesture and merest facial expression he conveys disbelief, reluctance, panic and finally acceptance of his fate at the hands of manipulative Maggie&quot;. His performance led to a Manchester Evening News Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

That same year he participated in the BBC series &quot;Comic Relief does Fame Academy&quot;, being the fourth &quot;student&quot; to be &quot;expelled&quot;. and in 2004, he appeared in the musical drama Blackpool as Tony Corlette.

The producers had Thomson lined up for the role of DI Fleming, but he wanted to read for Bould because he &quot;was up against a friend for the same part&quot;. Later that year he filmed a guest appearance as Nigel Pearson in a second series episode of &quot;Kingdom&quot;. He returned as a full-time cast member for the third series.

In October 2008, Thomson filmed a three-episode guest stint on the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, playing electrician-cum-children&#x27;s entertainer Jesse, which aired in December. In January 2009, it was announced that he would reprise the role for six months. Jesse returned to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in June, beginning a relationship with Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). He left 2010, after his contract was not renewed. Later that same year, he portrayed H.V. Kershaw in &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;, a dramatisation of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s development in the 1960s.

In 2011, Thomson joined the cast of the BBC television series &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;.

<doc id="1064223" wikidata="Q383167" url="?curid=1064223" title="CEN/XFS">
<text>CEN/XFS or XFS (&quot;extensions for financial services&quot;) provides a client-server architecture for financial applications on the Microsoft Windows platform, especially peripheral devices such as EFTPOS terminals and ATMs which are unique to the financial industry. It is an international standard promoted by the European Committee for Standardization (known by the acronym CEN, hence CEN/XFS). The standard is based on the [[Windows Open Services Architecture|WOSA]] Extensions for Financial Services or WOSA/XFS developed by Microsoft.

With the move to a more standardized software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. XFS provides a common API for accessing and manipulating various financial services devices regardless of the manufacturer.

== History ==
Chronology:
* 1991 - Microsoft forms &quot;Banking Solutions Vendor Council&quot;
* 1995 - WOSA/XFS 1.11 released
* 1997 - WOSA/XFS 2.0 released - additional support for 24 hours-a-day unattended operation
* 1998 - adopted by European Committee for Standardization as an international standard.
* 2000 - XFS 3.0 released by CEN
* 2008 - XFS 3.10 released by CEN
* 2011 - XFS 3.20 released by CEN
* 2015 - XFS 3.30 released by CEN
* 2020 - XFS 3.40 released by CEN
* 2022 - XFS 3.50 released by CEN

WOSA/XFS changed name to simply XFS when the standard was adopted by the international CEN/ISSS standards body. However, it is most commonly called CEN/XFS by the industry participants.

== XFS middleware ==
While the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to Java&#x27;s &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; mantra, often different hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that applications typically use a middleware to even out the differences between various platforms implementation of XFS.

Notable XFS middleware platforms include:
* F1 Solutions - F1 TPS (multi-vendor ATM &amp; POS solution)
* Serquo - Dwide (REST API middleware for XFS)
*Nexus Software LLC - Nexus Evolution
* Nautilus Hyosung - Nextware
* Cyttek Gen3XFS - Multivendor terminal solution for ATM
* Hitachi-Omron Terminal Solutions ATOM
* Diebold Agilis Power
* NCR - NCR XFS
* KAL - KAL Kalignite
* Auriga - The Banking E-volution- WWS Omnichannel Platform
* Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm Acquired by Diebold
* Wincor Nixdorf ProBase (ProBase C as WOSA/XFS platform - ProBase J as J/XFS platform)
* SBS Software KIXXtension
* Dynasty Technology Group - (JSI) Jam Service Interface
* HST Systems &amp; Technologies - HAL Interface
* FreeXFS- open source XFS platform
* GRG banking eCAT (multi-vendor ATM terminal solution)
* TIS xfs.js implementation(open source for node.js community)
* TEB Orion

== XFS test tools ==
XFS test tools allow testing of XFS applications and middleware on simulated hardware. Some tools include sophisticated automatic regression testing capabilities.

Providers of XFS test tools include:
* Cyttek Group - XFS Middleware
* Abbrevia Simplicity 
* Paragon VirtualATM Product Page ATM Testing
* FIS ATM TestLab, Open Test Solutions, Product Brochure (was Clear2Pay, formerly Level Four Software and Lexcel TestSystem ATM)
* Serquo XFS ATM Simulator Atmirage
* KAL KAL Kalignite Test Utilities
* Dynasty Technology Group - JSI Simulators
* HST Systems &amp; Technologies (Brazil)
* Takkto Technologies (Mexico)
* LUTZWOLF JDST - Testtool for J/XFS compatibility
* Afferent Software RapidFire ATM XFS 
== J/XFS ==
J/XFS is an alternative API to CEN/XFS (which is Windows specific) and also to Xpeak (which is Operating System independent, based on XML messages). J/XFS is written in Java with the objective to provide a platform agnostic client-server architecture for financial applications, especially peripheral devices used in the financial industry such as EFTPOS terminals and ATMs.

With the move to a more standardized software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. J/XFS provides a common Object Oriented API between a pure Java application and a wide range of financial devices, providing a layer of separation between application and device logic that can be implemented using a native J/XFS API or wrapping an existing implementation in JavaPOS or CEN/XFS.

J/XFS was developed by the companies De La Rue, IBM, NCR, Wincor Nixdorf and Sun Microsystems and is now hosted, monitored and maintained by the European Committee for Standardization, CEN.

<doc id="1064226" wikidata="Q7953978" url="?curid=1064226" title="WOSA">
<text>WOSA (101.1 FM) is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to Grove City, Ohio, featuring a classical music format known as &quot;Classical 101fm&quot;. Owned by Ohio State University, the station serves Columbus, Ohio, and much of the surrounding Columbus metro area, extending its reach into Mansfield, Marion and Southern Ohio with five full-power repeaters. The WOSA studios are located at the Fawcett Center on the Ohio State University campus, while the station transmitter resides off of Borror Road in Lockbourne. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WOSA is available online. It is one of a few non-commercial stations in the United States to broadcast outside of its recommended frequency range (88-92 MHz).

==History==
===WWCD (1990–2010)===
WWCD began broadcasting on August 21, 1990. The first song played on the station was &quot;Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, (Petrol)&quot; by the Dublin, Ireland band Something Happens. The station was long owned by Fun With Radio, LLC., whose founder, Roger Vaughn, purchased the station from Video Services in 1992. WWCD and its successor station, WWCD (102.5 FM), has always been either owned or operated by interests in metro Columbus, and is one of the few remaining independent radio stations in the U.S. playing alternative rock.

WWCD also lays claim to being one of the first stations in the United States to be simulcast and on Internet radio. In a March 2006 Radio &amp; Records list of the top 20 alternative rock radio stations in the United States, WWCD was ranked #4 in the country and #1 east of the Mississippi River.

WWCD&#x27;s longtime program director throughout the late 1990s and 2000s was afternoon DJ Andy &quot;Andyman&quot; Davis. With the station almost since its inception, Davis previously served as the station&#x27;s music director. Davis died of a suspected heart attack while on vacation in Michigan with his family on July 18, 2010. The annual &quot;Andyman-a-Thon&quot; also continues in his name.

===2010 &quot;frequency shift&quot;===
Ohio State University, under licensee WOSU Public Media, announced a $4.8 million purchase of WWCD from Fun With Radio, LLC. on June 30, 2010. At the same time, Fun With Radio entered into a local marketing agreement with the WHIZ Media Group to take over programming on WCVZ (102.5 FM) in Baltimore immediately, with a future option for purchase. Although generally reported and regarded as a &quot;frequency shift&quot; for WWCD, Fun With Radio took over programming and operations of WCVZ; changed the station&#x27;s format from country to alternative as a direct simulcast of WWCD; and rebranded the station as &quot;CD101 @ 102.5&quot;.

The purchase of the original WWCD was consummated that December 14. WOSU Public Media then changed WWCD&#x27;s callsign to WOSA; changed the station&#x27;s format to classical music; and rebranded the station as &quot;Classical 101fm&quot;. Concurrently, WCVZ&#x27;s callsign was changed to WWCD.

===WOSA (2010–present)===
WOSA&#x27;s roots date back to WOSU-FM&#x27;s long history as a classical outlet, airing the format on a full-time basis from 1980 until 2008 as a complement to WOSU, which would air more traditional public radio fare. Starting on January 14, 2008, WOSU-FM switched to a mixed news/classical format, introducing NPR news magazines during morning and evening drive-times along with assorted NPR and PRI weekend programs. Many of these programs were simulcast with its AM sister station WOSU, which still programmed a separate news/talk format. As a result, WOSU established a 24-hour all classical music service on its second HD Radio channel and on its web site.

Upon WOSA&#x27;s establishment, it assumed WOSU-FM&#x27;s 24-hour HD-2 and internet-only all classical music service on a full-time basis, operating as a non-commercial station. In addition, WOSU-FM&#x27;s format changed to news/talk as a simulcast with WOSU (subsequently divested). WOSU also converted four repeater stations for WOSU-FM—WOSB in Marion, WOSE in Coshocton, WOSP in Portsmouth and WOSV in Mansfield—to repeaters of WOSA. In particular, WOSB and WOSV serve areas north of Columbus that are not served well by the new 101.1 frequency.

On March 2, 2020, WOSA&#x27;s repeaters, along with the newly-acquired WOSX in Granville, readded some of WOSU-FM&#x27;s news programming, including &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;, and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, to their schedules, while continuing to simulcast WOSA for most of the day. WOSA itself remains all-classical.

==Programming==

===Repeaters===
Most of WOSA&#x27;s programming is simulcast on WOSE Coshocton (91.1 FM), WOSB Marion (91.1 FM), WOSP Portsmouth (91.5 FM), WOSV Mansfield (91.7 FM), and WOSX Granville (91.1 FM).

<doc id="1064228" wikidata="Q498078" url="?curid=1064228" title="Bad Arolsen">
<text>Bad Arolsen (, until 1997 Arolsen, &quot;Bad&quot; being the German name for &quot;Spa&quot;) is a small town in northern Hesse, Germany, in Waldeck-Frankenberg district. From 1655 until 1918 it served as the residence town of the Princes of Waldeck-Pyrmont and then until 1929 as the capital of the Waldeck Free State. The International Tracing Service has its headquarters in Bad Arolsen.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Bad Arolsen is situated roughly 45 km west of Kassel.

The German-Dutch holiday road called the Orange Route runs through the town, joining towns, cities and regions associated with the House of Orange.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Bad Arolsen neighbours are: the town of Diemelstadt to the north, the town of Volkmarsen (both belonging to the county of Waldeck-Frankenberg); the town of Wolfhagen in the southeast (Kassel district); the town of Waldeck to the south, the community of Twistetal to the southwest; the community of Diemelsee to the west (the last three in Waldeck-Frankenberg county) and the town of Marsberg (Hochsauerlandkreis in North Rhine-Westphalia).

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main district (8,300 inhabitants), which bears the same name as the town, Bad Arolsen consists of the following subdivisions:
* Braunsen, 199 inhabitants
* Bühle, 110 inhabitants
* Kohlgrund, 255 inhabitants.
* Helsen, 2,156 inhabitants
* Landau, 1,120 inhabitants
* Massenhausen, 583 inhabitants
* Mengeringhausen, 3,746 inhabitants
* Neu-Berich, 246 inhabitants
* Schmillinghausen, 495 inhabitants
* Volkhardinghausen, 130 inhabitants
* Wetterburg, 859 inhabitants

== History ==
The earliest documents mentioning Arolsen date back to 1131 when an Augustinian nunnery was established there with the name of &quot;Aroldessen&quot;. The nunnery was secularized in 1526 and in 1655 became the residence of the Counts (later Princes) of Waldeck, who converted it into a stately home. It was torn down in 1710 and replaced with a new Baroque structure (1713–1728) by Friedrich Anton Ulrich, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1676–1728).

From 1918 to 1929 Arolsen was capital of the Free State of Waldeck-Pyrmont (after 1922: Free State of Waldeck), which was subsequently incorporated into Prussia.

During World War II, in 1943–1945, the Nazis operated a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp, which housed a total of 185 prisoners, of whom 35% were from German-occupied Poland, 30% from German-occupied Russia and 15% from Germany. After the war, it was located within the American-occupied zone of Germany, and became part of West Germany.

In 2003, the town hosted the 43rd Hessentag state festival.

== Politics ==

=== Town council ===

The town council&#x27;s 37 seats are apportioned in accordance with municipal elections held on 26 March 2006:

=== Town government ===
The town is governed by the town magistrate which is headed by the Mayor of Bad Arolsen. 
The incumbent Mayor is Jürgen van der Horst (Independent), first elected in 2007. His current six-year term is scheduled to end in 2025.

=== Coat of arms ===
Bad Arolsen&#x27;s civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: In argent a nine-leaved oak tree vert with four acorns Or, before which an inescutcheon within which in Or a bar-topped letter &quot;A&quot; sable surmounted by a halved eight-pointed star sable.

The oak tree stands for the surrounding woods and indirectly the fresh air that Bad Arolsen is known for as a climatic spa. The inescutcheon shows the town&#x27;s (original) initial, and the eight-pointed star of Waldeck.

The original arms were dropped in 1938 owing to a perceived reference to Freemasonry, which was not officially tolerated in Nazi Germany. The charge in question was &quot;God&#x27;s Eye&quot; – a triangle with the sun&#x27;s rays shining out of it, such as may still be seen in Bad Krozingen&#x27;s civic coat of arms. Bad Arolsen&#x27;s old arms showed the same inescutcheon over this, but &quot;God&#x27;s Eye&quot; was replaced with an oak tree in 1938.

=== Partnerships ===
* Bad Köstritz, Thüringen
* Heusden-Zolder, Belgium
* Hermann, Missouri, United States
* Klütz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern

== Culture and sightseeing ==

=== The town ===
Worthy of note is the town&#x27;s baroque layout near the stately home. The street grid shows a chequered pattern that was typical of that time. It was originally planned to build a mirror-image layout to the stately home&#x27;s east and west, but the plans were never fully carried out; after completing the developments west of the stately home, there was no money left to do the eastern part. Instead, the mirrored layout is illustrated by landscaping the area with trees and bushes. Some of the development&#x27;s buildings are protected by law. Since 1999 there has been a &quot;Gestaltungssatzung&quot; – or &quot;design code&quot; – in place to ensure the townscape&#x27;s current form through collective protection.

The Grosse Allee (&quot;Grand Avenue&quot;) is a remarkable piece of city landscaping. It is a broad avenue running one mile from east to west lined by some 880 German oak trees in a six-line arrangement. Particularly during the warm months of spring, summer and fall it attracts scores of people strolling and enjoying the shady park-like atmosphere. The avenue was built in 1676 as a prestigious connecting way for the carriages between the &quot;Residenzschloss&quot; and the princely &quot;Lustschloss&quot;, the latter having been torn down in the year 1725.

=== Buildings ===

*The baroque-style Schloß Arolsen, originally belonging to the Princes of Waldeck-Pyrmont with its imposing construction was built between 1713 and 1728 by architect Julius Ludwig Rothweil. Of particular importance are the ceiling paintings by the Italian artist Carlo Ludovici Castelli, and the outstanding stucco works by Andrea Gallasini.
*&quot;Landauer Wasserkunst&quot;, an historic waterworks in Landau dating from 1555.

=== Regular events ===
*March/April: Lighting of the &quot;Easter Fire&quot; on the Königsberg fair ground
*May: &quot;Arolser Barockfestspiele&quot; (Baroque festival)
*August: &quot;Arolser Kram- und Viehmarkt&quot; (a fair with amusement rides, household goods and cattle markets at the Königsberg fair ground)
*August: Bad Arolsen &quot;Twistesee Triathlon&quot; running
*November: &quot;Bad Arolsen Advent Waldmarathon&quot; running
*December: &quot;Weihnachtsmarkt&quot; (Christmas fair at the Kirchplatz in the towns central place ”Kirchplatz“)
*Repeating every seven years (last time 2007): The “Freischiessen festival” in Mengeringhausen

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Of particular economic importance to the town was its role as a garrison. In 1994 the Belgian Army deactivated its garrison and left the town. On 17 December 2004, the Bundeswehr deactivated its camp in Mengeringhausen.

=== Transport ===
Bad Arolsen is located on the railway line from Kassel to Korbach. Local public transport is also handled by buses of the North Hesse Transport Association (&quot;Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund&quot;; NVV). The town is also served by the BRS (&quot;Busverkehr - Ruhr - Sieg&quot;) bus company.

=== Public institutions ===
Since 1946, Bad Arolsen has been headquarters to the International Tracing Service, an organization dedicated to finding missing civilians, typically lost to family and friends as a result of war or political unrest during World War II. The institution was led and administered until December 2012 by the International Committee of the Red Cross and funded by the Federal Republic of Germany; it is now administered by the Federal Republic of Germany.

A venue for millions of documents related to the Nazi-attempted extermination of the Jewish people and others, the ITS holds vast archives of Nazi-related documents. In April 2006, German justice minister Brigitte Zypries announced that Germany would cooperate with the United States and allow survivors and historians of the Holocaust access to 47 million pages of documents, although an eleven-nation accord had to decide unanimously that this was to be done. More than 12 million of the documents have now being digitally scanned and shared with research institutions around the world. The archive fully opened when France, Italy and Greece ratified changes to the access protocol. Information kept hidden from the public since its inception was finally opened to the public in November 2007.

<doc id="1064235" wikidata="Q1752323" url="?curid=1064235" title="Purdue Boilermakers">
<text>The Purdue Boilermakers are the official intercollegiate athletics teams representing Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana. As is common with athletic nicknames, the Boilermakers nickname is also used as colloquial designation of Purdue&#x27;s students and alumni at large. The nickname is often shortened to &quot;Boilers&quot; by fans. Purdue is one of the few college athletic programs that is not funded by student fees or subsidized by the university.

== Origin of &quot;Boilermakers&quot; nickname ==
In 1889, the Purdue football team played Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and won the game 18-4. Students from the college and citizens of Crawfordsville began calling the Purdue players &quot;a great big burly gang of corn-huskers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;pumpkin-shuckers&quot;, &quot;railsplitters&quot;, &quot;blacksmiths,&quot; &quot;cornfield sailors&quot;, and &quot;foundry hands&quot;. The Purdue students experienced hands-on education at the university, including the maintenance of a fully operational steam locomotive.

Purdue defeated Wabash College again in 1891, 44–0. An account of the game in the Crawfordsville Daily Argus News of October 26, 1891, was headlined, &quot;Slaughter of Innocents: Wabash Snowed Completely Under by the Burly Boiler Makers from Purdue&quot;. Purdue became known as the Boilermakers the next year.

Several of the local schools added to the boilermaker tradition by suggesting that Purdue was going up the Wabash River and hiring workers from the nearby Monon railroad yards to play football. Purdue&#x27;s official mascot is a locomotive, the Boilermaker Special. The Monon Railroad had its main locomotive shops in Lafayette, not far from campus.

Purdue&#x27;s athletic teams wear a combination of old-gold, black, and white, colors that have identified Purdue since 1887.

==Varsity sports==

===Baseball===

The Purdue Boilermakers baseball team have been conference champions twice, in 1909 and 2012. In 1987, 2012 and 2018 they appeared in the NCAA tournament.

===Basketball===

The Boilermaker men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams have won more Big Ten Championships (regular season and tournament) than any other conference school, with 37 conference banners, including a league-leading 24 for the men&#x27;s team. Men&#x27;s former head coach Gene Keady coached his final season with the Boilermakers in the 2004–2005 season after 25 years with the Boilermakers. Coach Keady became Purdue&#x27;s all-time-winningest coach on December 6, 1997. In his years at Purdue, Keady led the Boilermakers to a 512-270 record and a .655 winning percentage.

The current coach of the Boilermaker men&#x27;s basketball team is Matt Painter. A former player and Purdue Alum under Keady, Painter is now in his 20th season as the head coach and is currently second on the school&#x27;s all-time wins list.

In the 2024 NCAA Tournament, Painter guided Purdue to their first Final Four in 44 years, and first National Championship game since 1969.

===Football===
In the early 1890s Purdue fielded dominating football teams. In 1891 Purdue went 4-0, outscoring opponents 192-0. In 1892 Purdue went 8-0, outscoring opponents 320-24. In 1893 Purdue went 5-2-1, outscoring opponents 334-144. In 1894 Purdue went 9-1, outscoring opponents 288-36. Over these four years, Purdue&#x27;s combined record was 26-3-1, outscoring opponents 1134-204. Purdue beat in-state rival Indiana University 60-0, 68-0, 64-0, and 6-0 by an understandable forfeit. Purdue went 2-1 against Illinois, 2-1 Wisconsin, 3-0 against Chicago and split 2 games with Michigan.

The Purdue Boilermakers competed as an independent until 1889. In 1890, they joined the Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association and, finally, was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference in 1896. The Purdue Boilermakers were Big Ten Conference Champions in 1918, 1929, 1931, 1932, 1943, 1952, 1967, and 2000. However, they made their first appearance in the Rose Bowl — the &quot;grand-daddy of them all&quot; — with a 1966 second-place finish in the Big Ten; conference rules at that time prevented Michigan State from appearing in consecutive Rose Bowls. The Boilermakers, under NFL hall-of-famer Bob Griese, defeated the University of Southern California Trojans 14-13 to win the 1967 Rose Bowl. When the Boilermakers shared the Big Ten title the following season, the consecutive-appearance rule kept them out of the 1968 Rose Bowl. Purdue did not return to the Rose Bowl until 2001, under future New Orleans Saints quarterback, Drew Brees, losing to the University of Washington Huskies 34-24.
The Boilermakers have appeared in a total of 21 post-season bowl games, compiling a record of 11-10. Their most recent victory was a 48-45 victory over the University of Tennessee Volunteers in the 2021 Music City Bowl, with their most recent appearance being a 63–7 defeat dealt by the LSU Tigers at the 2023 Citrus Bowl.

Purdue has traditionally been called the &quot;Cradle of Quarterbacks&quot;, having produced NFL stars Cecil Isbell, Dale Samuels, Bob DeMoss, NFL Hall of Famer and Super Bowl MVP Len Dawson, NFL Hall of Famer Bob Griese, Mike Phipps, Gary Danielson, Mark Herrmann, Scott Campbell, Jim Everett, Eric Hunter, Billy Dicken, Kyle Orton, and Super Bowl MVP Drew Brees. Purdue QBs have thrown more touchdowns in the NFL than those from any other university, 1,754 at the end of the 2023 season. In 2011, there were three starting quarterbacks in the NFL from Purdue: Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints, Kyle Orton of the Denver Broncos, and Curtis Painter of the Indianapolis Colts. Current NFL QBs are David Blough of the Detroit Lions and Aidan O&#x27;Connell of the Las Vegas Raiders. The team is currently coached by Barry Odom.

===Men&#x27;s golf===
The Purdue golf team inaugural season was in 1921. The team earned a national championship in 1961, and have been Big Ten champions twelve times. The team has had two NCAA individual champions: Fred Wampler in 1950 and Joe Campbell in 1955. The team has also earned 12 Big Ten championships through 2017.

===Women&#x27;s soccer===
The Boilermakers&#x27; first season of soccer was in 1998, but began Big Ten play in 1999. The team has achieved seven NCAA tournament berths, their first being in 2002 and their most recent being in the 2021 season. The Boilermakers furthest run in the NCAA tournament was in 2003, advancing to the third round. The Boilermakers have also reached the Big Ten tournament in ten different seasons, with a tournament win in 2007 under coach Jack Warner. The current head coach of the Boilermakers is Drew Roff, who is in his ninth year as head coach as of 2023.

===Softball===
The Boilermaker softball team began play in 1994. The team has made two NCAA Tournament appearances in 2008 and 2009. The current head coach is Magali Frezzotti.

===Women&#x27;s volleyball===

The Purdue Boilermakers Women&#x27;s Volleyball team started play in 1975 and has made the AIAW/NCAA tournament 27 times since. This includes five trips to the regional finals. The team has been coached by Dave Shondell since 2003.

===Wrestling===

The Purdue Boilermaker wrestling team started in the 1913-1914 season. As a team, the Boilermakers have placed as high as 2nd at the NCAA National Championships, and have had individual wrestlers qualify for the NCAA tournament for over 25 years straight. The team is coached by Tony Ersland, who wrestled for the University of Iowa under legendary coach Dan Gable. He is assisted by Tyrel Todd, Kendric Maple, and Jake Sueflohn. The team competes in the Big Ten Conference. Purdue Wrestling practices in the Blake Wrestling Training Center and competes on campus in the Holloway Gymnasium (2,288).

===Crew===
 The Purdue Crew is a student athletic rowing club established in 1949. It is the largest such club on campus with an average of 130 members throughout the season. The program competes nationwide against both club and D1 programs. As a club, the crew is supported by Purdue University&#x27;s Department of Recreational Sports by employing the head and assistant coach positions. Strong alumni support has allowed for much of the growth and success of the program by financing equipment and facilities. The club sponsors or supports several annual events, including the Hunger Hike and the Feast of the Hunter&#x27;s Moon. Notably, Amanda Elmore from Purdue Crew&#x27;s class of 2013 won an Olympic Gold Medal in 2016 in the Women&#x27;s 8+ category.

=== Men&#x27;s ice hockey ===
The Purdue University Hockey Club was founded in the 1960s and currently competes in the Division III Indiana Collegiate Hockey Conference of the American Collegiate Hockey Association.

They had similar success in the 2015 season, going 9-6 and winning the conference championship, then losing to top ranked Grand Canyon in the first round. Their next season went the same, ending 9-6, winning the conference championship, and losing in the first round of the MCLA tournament, this time to Chapman. The team&#x27;s current coach is Dan Sahm, former Boilermaker captain, defensive player of the year, and HM All-American.

===Men&#x27;s soccer ===
Since at least the 1930s, Purdue has fielded a club soccer team.

== Mascots ==

=== Boilermaker Special ===

The Boilermaker Special has been the official mascot of Purdue since the 1930s. The &#x27;Specials&#x27; are Victorian era locomotives. The Boilermaker Special I made its debut on the first day of classes in 1940. Alumni, faculty and students have since then raised funds to replace the Special as it has worn out. The Boilermaker Special V was unveiled in 1993 at the Purdue–Notre Dame game.

===Purdue Pete===
In 1940, the then owners of the University Bookstore, Doc Epple and Red Sammons, hired local artist Art Evans to draw a boilermaker to use as an advertising icon for the bookstore. A modernized version is still used in that capacity at University Bookstore. In 1944, the editors of the university&#x27;s Debris yearbook sought, and obtained, permission from University Bookstore to use Purdue Pete on the cover of the 1944 edition of the Debris yearbook. When asked the name of the boilermaker depicted in the advertising drawing, Epple coined the name &quot;Pete&quot;. Since 1956, Purdue Pete has been a regular at Purdue games - usually wearing the head with a football or basketball uniform and portrayed by one of four selected members of the spirit squad. Originally, the head costume was made of chicken wire and papier-mâché, but in later years has been made of fiberglass for better durability during rainy football games. Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School in north-east Illinois also uses a mascot similar to Pete called &quot;Bruno the Boilermaker&quot;.

===The Boilermaker===
The Boilermaker is a statue located adjacent to Ross Ade Stadium that was dedicated on Friday, November 4, 2005, as a monument commemorating the &quot;indomitable spirit of the boilermaker&quot;.

<doc id="1064241" wikidata="Q25247355" url="?curid=1064241" title="Tao Nan School">
<text>Tao Nan School (abbreviation: TNS; ), is a co-educational primary school in Singapore. One of the six Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan schools. Along with Ai Tong School, Chongfu Primary School, Kong Hwa School, Nan Chiau Primary School and Nan Chiau High School, Tao Nan School is among the 30 most popular primary schools listed by the Ministry of Education.

Tao Nan School is also offering the Gifted Education Programme that started in 1996. In 2007, it also started the Bi-Cultural Chinese Elective Programme (BiCEP) to develop effective bilingualism in its students. Tao Nan celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006 with a carnival held on November 4. To provide better infrastructure to support the teaching and learning of its students, Tao Nan School underwent the PERI Upgrading from 2014 to 2015 and operated at the holding site in Bedok South Road. With the completion of the Upgrading Exercise, it returned to Marine Parade in 2016.

==School crest==
The school crest consists of a leaping lion and an open book on a blue shield. The lion represents the Lion City, which is Singapore. Its leaping position symbolises bravery and continuous progress and advancement in the face of difficulties. The open book represents the unquenchable thirst for knowledge. At the base of the crest is the school&#x27;s motto: &quot;Sincerity and Perseverance&quot;. The entire crest signifies the acquisition of abundant knowledge and the training of the strong and healthy body.

==History==

The Hokkien Clan Association (otherwise known as the Hokkien Huay Kuan) started Tao Nan School on 18 November 1906. It was one of the six modern Chinese schools in Singapore with a curriculum influenced by the educational reforms in China at the end of the 19th century. The school was initially named Tao Nan Study Hall (道南學堂, &quot;Taonan hsüeht&#x27;ang&quot;). &quot;Taonan hsüeht&#x27;ang&quot; (道南學堂) can be translated as &quot;spreading our philosophy, our culture and ideas to the South&quot;.

Classes were first held at the residence of Tan Kim Ching on North Bridge Road. With support from the Hokkien community, a purpose-built school was constructed. Benefactors include Tan Boon Liat, Lee Cheng Yan, Low Kim Pong, Tan Kah Kee, and Oei Tiong Ham, &quot;Majoor der Chinezen&quot;, the sugar magnate from Semarang, Central Java, whose donation largely financed the purchase of land on Armenian Street. Although it was originally set up to serve the Hokkien community and the lessons were held in Hokkien, it became the first Chinese school to accept speakers of other Chinese dialects.

The move to Armenian Street coincided with the 1911 overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Tao Nan became the first Chinese school to change the medium of instruction from the Hokkien dialect to Mandarin. One of the teachers was the philanthropist Lee Kong Chian (1894–1967). Pioneer artist Pan Shou was the headmaster from 1932 to 1940.

In 1982, Tao Nan School moved to a new campus in Marine Parade, where it still remains to this date. It was named a SAP (Special Assistance Plan) school in 1990 and a Gifted Education Programme Centre in 1996. In 2014, it moved to a temporary campus in Bedok South, while the Marine Parade campus underwent PERI Upgrading. It moved back into the Marine Parade campus in 2016. With 110 years of history () it is one of Singapore&#x27;s oldest primary schools.

==Culture==
===Uniform===
Boys wear white shirts and light blue shorts. Girls wear white blouses and light blue pinafores. Both uniforms have the school crest emblazoned on the left. While school shoes and socks can be purchased, any white-based shoes or ankle socks are allowed.

For days with PE lessons, students wear a white shirt with dark blue shorts to school. This uniform may be worn throughout the day on those days. The previous shirt had the image of the mascot of the house (Dolphin, Killer Whale, Marlin or Shark) that the student belonged to on the back. The new shirt has the words &quot;道南&quot; on the back with &quot;Tao Nan&quot; underneath. The front has the school crest over the heart. The school initials (TNS) are sewn on the shorts. House T-shirts are the same as the normal shirts, except that they have a picture of the house animal on the back instead of the school initials.

Prefects wear a blue Velcro tie, a name tag with their name, and a junior prefect or prefect badge above the school crest. The number of white lines printed on the tie determines the prefect&#x27;s status: the Head Prefect has three stripes, the Vice-Head Prefect and other members of the Executive Committee have two, and the others have either one or no stripes.

The old junior prefect badge has the words &#x27;junior prefect&#x27; engraved on them. The prefect badge has the school crest and &#x27;prefect&#x27; written in gold on a black background together with the Prefect&#x27;s name. The frame of the badge is gold.

A prefect T-shirt has been introduced. It is white with a blue high collar, with the word prefect on the left side of the T-shirt and on the back. Prefect in Mandarin (学长) is printed in blue on the left sleeve of the T-shirt. The prefects wear this shirt with their PE shorts on events during which they have prefect duties, such as Pesta Sukan or Swimming Carnival.

===Sports&#x27; Day===
Every year, there is a sports day event held by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. All members, (i.e. Ai Tong School, Kong Hwa School, Chongfu Primary School, Nan Chiau Primary School) and Tao Nan itself.

<text>USS &quot;Breese&quot; (DD-122) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, and later redesignated, DM-18 in World War II. She was the only ship named for Captain Kidder Breese.

Commissioned as a destroyer in 1919, she undertook a number of patrol and training duties along the East Coast of the United States until being decommissioned in 1922. Overhauled in 1931, she returned to service with the United States Pacific Fleet on training and patrol for the next 10 years. She was present during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and following this she supported several operations during the war, laying minefields and sweeping for mines in the Pacific. Following the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1946 and broken up.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Breese&quot; was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with ten of her sisters, were constructed at Newport News Shipbuilding shipyards in Newport News, Virginia using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works.

She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . On trials, &quot;Harding&quot; reached a speed of . She was armed with four 4&quot;/50 caliber guns, two 3&quot;/23 caliber guns, and twelve 21-inch torpedo tubes. She had a regular crew complement of 122 officers and enlisted men. She was driven by two Parsons or Westinghouse turbines, and powered by four Normand boilers.

Specifics on &quot;Breese&quot;″s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers known unofficially as the &#x27;Liberty Type&#x27; to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem, which used Curtis steam turbines and Yarrow boilers. The Bethlehem destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight. Ships such as &quot;Breese&quot;, however, performed better than this.

&quot;Breese&quot; was the only U.S. Navy ship to be named for Kidder Breese, who had been a U.S. Navy officer during the Mexican–American War and later the Civil War.

==Service history==

===Interwar period===
&quot;Breese&quot; was launched on 11 May 1918 out of Newport News, Virginia. She was sponsored by Gilbert McIlvaine, daughter of Breese; and commissioned 23 October 1918. After her commissioning, she reported to the United States Atlantic Fleet and cruised for several days as an escort for convoys supporting World War I, before the end of the conflict on 11 November. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia at the end of the war, she was assigned to Destroyer Division 12 and served off the coast of Cuba on training exercises during the spring of 1919. In July 1919, Destroyer Division 12 was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, based at San Diego, California. For the next year, she served with Destroyer Squadron 4 and, from June 1920, began operating in Rotating Reserve. From October 1920 to June 1922, she participated in division maneuvers and fleet maneuvers with the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s main battle force, and she was placed out of commission 17 June 1922.

On 5 January 1931, &quot;Breese&quot; was redesignated as a light minelayer, with the hull classification symbol of DM-18. Following an overhaul and conversion at Mare Island Navy Yard, she was recommissioned on 1 June 1931. She then returned to San Diego for sea trials and standardization tests in her new role. These completed, she departed for Pearl Harbor. She was assigned to Mine Division 1 of the Pacific Fleet, and operated out of Hawaiian waters. She conducted several training exercises, including with the submarine divisions where she served as a target ship. She also served as a station ship for aircraft. She returned to San Diego in June 1937, and placed out of commission and in reserve on 12 November 1937. On 25 September 1939, &quot;Breese&quot; was again recommissioned and assigned to Mine Division 5 of the Pacific Fleet. On 2 November 1939, she arrived at Puget Sound Navy Yard and began to conduct Neutrality Patrol off the Oregon and Washington coasts. Throughout 1940, she cruised to different bases along the coastline of Alaska with the commander of the Alaskan Sector aboard. Upon returning, she rejoined Mine Division 5 in San Francisco and steamed for Hawaii, returning there on 10 December 1940. Attached to Mine Division 2 in the Pacific Fleet, she took part in training exercises in the operating area and on the Maui range during much of 1941.

===World War II===
On 7 December 1941, &quot;Breese&quot; was moored in the Middle Loch, northwest of Ford Island. She was moored to Buoy D-3 alongside a nest of three other minelayers which were also converted &quot;Wickes&quot; destroyers; , , and . At the outbreak of the attack, her crew was distracted by the initial assault on Ford Island and was buzzed by a flight of Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers. &quot;Breese&quot; quickly loaded her machine guns and began firing at 07:57. She and many of the other ships in the area were quickly able to mobilize a strong anti-aircraft defense which lasted throughout the morning. She was credited with hits on several Japanese aircraft and damaging at least one midget submarine. &quot;Breese&quot; was undamaged in the attack.

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, she remained berthed in the harbor until leaving on 26 December, carrying mail and orders for other ships. She rendezvoused with at the mouth of the harbor to offload this, then steamed east on patrol.

On 6 June 1942, she took on 84 survivors of the carrier which had sunk in the aftermath of the Battle of Midway. During the summer of 1942, she operated out of the South Pacific On 3 August 1942, she, along with minesweepers &quot;Gamble&quot; and , were laying mines in Segond Channel, Espiritu Santo. Destroyer entered the strait on escort patrol, having not been notified of the minefield, when she struck one of the mines and sank. &quot;Breese&quot;, which was moored in the channel, rendered aid. On 30 September 1942, she was on a nighttime exercise off Espiritu Santo when she was damaged in a collision with the cruiser . She carried out minesweeping duties during the consolidation of the Solomon Islands from 1–13 May 1943, where she was assigned to Task Group 36.5 alongside &quot;Gamble&quot;, , and . They laid mined in Blackett Strait to guard the western approaches to Kula Gulf.

She supported Allied efforts around New Georgia-Rendova Vangunu from 29 June to 25 August. Assigned to Task Unit 36.2.2, she, &quot;Preble&quot; and &quot;Gamble&quot; laid mines off Shortland Harbor, Bougainville. She then supported the occupation and defense of Cape Torokina conducting minesweeping duties there from 1 to 8 November. She later supported the Leyte landings from 12 to 24 October 1944. She was subsequently among the ships to support the Lingayen Gulf landings from 4 to 18 January 1945. She supported the Battle of Iwo Jima from 7 February to 7 March. She undertook mine duties supporting the Battle of Okinawa between 25 March and 30 June. In her final act of the war, she steamed in support of the United States Third Fleet near mainland Japan between 5 and 31 July. In August and September 1945 &quot;Breese&quot; swept mines in the East China Sea and Kyūshū-Korean area following the end of the war.

On 7 November 1945, &quot;Breese&quot; steamed to the west coast arriving 26 November. She transited the Panama Canal and arrived at New York City on 13 December. She was decommissioned on 15 January 1946 and sold for scrap on 16 May 1946. She received ten battle stars for her service in World War II.

<doc id="1064260" wikidata="Q1545246" url="?curid=1064260" title="Thirteen Women">
<text>Thirteen Women is a 1932 American pre-Code psychological thriller film, produced by David O. Selznick and directed by George Archainbaud. It stars Myrna Loy, Irene Dunne and Ricardo Cortez. The film is based on the 1930 bestselling novel of the same name by Tiffany Thayer and was adapted for the screen by Bartlett Cormack and Samuel Ornitz.

Several characters were deleted from the film&#x27;s final version, including those played by Leon Ames, Phyllis Fraser, and Betty Furness (in what would have been Furness&#x27;s film debut at the age of 16). The film portrays only 11 women, not 13, with Fraser and Furness playing the two characters edited from the film.

The film premiered in October at the Roxy Theater in New York City on October 15, 1932, then released in Los Angeles, and a few other cities in November 1932. A limited national release came in 1933. Originally running 73 minutes, the studio edited 14 minutes from the picture before release. The film was re-released in 1935 (post-Code) by RKO, hoping to turn a profit by cashing on the growing popularity of stars Dunne and Loy. &quot;Thirteen Women&quot; has been cited as an early &quot;female ensemble&quot; film, as well as an early influence on the &quot;slasher film&quot; genre.

==Plot==
Thirteen women, who were sorority sisters at the all-girl&#x27;s college St. Alban&#x27;s, all write to a clairvoyant &quot;swami&quot; who by mail sends each a horoscope foreseeing swift doom. However, the clairvoyant is under the sway of Ursula Georgi, a half-Javanese Eurasian woman who was snubbed at school by the other women owing to her mixed-race heritage, behavior which eventually forced her to leave school. She now seeks revenge by manipulating the women into killing themselves or each other. She also goads the clairvoyant into killing himself by falling into the path of a subway train.

The victims are set up and killed off one by one until Laura Stanhope, living in Beverly Hills, is one of the few still alive. With the help of Laura&#x27;s chauffeur, Ursula tries to kill Laura&#x27;s young son Bobby with both tainted candy and an explosive rubber ball, but is thwarted. Ursula follows Laura and Bobby as they flee by train, unaware that police sergeant Barry Clive is escorting them. After confronting Laura, and hypnotizing her into falling asleep, Ursula enters Bobby&#x27;s room and is caught by Clive. She then flees to the back of the train and jumps to her death.

==Production notes==
&quot;Thirteen Women&quot; features the only film appearance of actress Peg Entwistle. Entwistle became despondent over her career and jumped to her death from the Hollywood Sign on September 16, 1932. The film premiered in New York on October 15 (almost exactly a month after her suicide), and in Los Angeles in November. Entwistle had a supporting role in the original cut, with scenes running approximately sixteen minutes. After the film performed poorly for test audiences, her screen time was cut to four minutes.

The character played by Entwistle, that of Hazel Cousins, is a married woman in the film, who kills her husband and goes to prison. In the book, Hazel is a virgin who remains so simply because she is considered too beautiful; men are either too intimidated to approach her, assume she is married or engaged or believe that she will break their heart. Hazel eventually becomes a lesbian after she is seduced by the wife of the doctor treating her for tuberculosis, and starves herself to death in a sanitarium while suffering the heartache of having been abandoned by her lover Martha. In both the book and movie, May and June Raskob (played by Harriet Hagman and Mary Duncan) are twin sisters who work in a circus, but in the book they are overweight sideshow attractions rather than photogenic trapeze artists as in the film.

In this film, actor Edward J. Pawley received his first screen kiss (from Myrna Loy). He appeared in over 50 movies during his 10-year career in Hollywood, playing mostly &quot;bad guy&quot; roles.

==Home media==
On February 21, 2012, the 59-minute edit of &quot;Thirteen Women&quot; was released on manufactured-on-demand DVD through the Warner Archive Collection.

Zawisza the Black of Garbów,{{efn| Polish: &quot;Zawisza Czarny z Garbowa&quot;, pronunciation: {{IPA|pl|zaˈvʲiʂa ˈt͡ʂarn̪ɨ|}}; Latin: &quot;Zawissius Niger de Garbow&quot;}} of Sulima coat of arms ({{circa}} 1379 – 12 June 1428), was a Polish knight and nobleman who served as a commander and diplomat under Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło and Hungarian-Bohemian king Sigismund of Luxembourg. During his life, he was regarded as a model of knightly virtues and was renowned for winning multiple tournaments.

== Name ==
Historians propose two possible theories to the origins of Zawisza&#x27;s nickname &quot;Black&quot; (Polish: &quot;Czarny&quot;). According to more popular, and more probable, theory, his nickname came from his black hair. The second theory proposes that the nickname came from his custom-made, black armour.

==Origin==
Zawisza was born in Stary Garbów, Kingdom of Poland (in modern south-eastern Poland), into a local noble family (of the Sulima), his father Mikołaj being the castellan of Konary-Sieradz (&quot;konarsko-sieradzki&quot;), while his mother was named Dorota. He had two younger brothers: Jan Farurej, the &quot;starost&quot; of Spisz; and Piotr Kruczek. In 1397, Zawisza married Barbara of the Piława clan, the niece of Bishop of Kraków Piotr Wysz, and they had four sons.

==1410–1419==
Briefly in the service of the Teutonic Order, he soon renounced it, and in 1410 he took part in the Battle of Grunwald on the Polish side. After the battle he and his close friend Stibor of Stiboricz proposed a peace treaty between Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland and Sigismund of Luxembourg, then King of Hungary, which came to be known as the Treaty of Lubowla. In 1412 he participated in the conference between Sigismund, Wladyslaw II and Tvrtko II of Bosnia at Buda, where he won the tournament held there, with 1,500 knights present.
Zawisza was as much a diplomat as he was a warrior, being an envoy for the Polish king Władysław II and Hungarian-Bohemian king Sigismund of Luxembourg. As one of six diplomats that represented the Polish Kingdom and King Władysław II at the Council of Constance, he was one of very few supporters of Jan Hus, and consequently strongly opposed his condemnation and subsequent execution for heresy.

In 1416, Zawisza participated in a tournament at Perpignan in which he defeated the well-known knight John II of Aragon and Navarre. The following year, he became the &quot;starosta&quot; of Kruszwica. In 1419, he went to Sigismund again, as a deputy of King Władysław II, to ask for the hand of Sophia of Bavaria, the widow of Sigismund&#x27;s brother Wenceslaus of Bohemia. Subsequently, Zawisza participated in the Hussite Wars on the side of King Sigismund. During Sigismund&#x27;s defeat at Kutná Hora (21 December 1421), Zawisza was taken prisoner by the Hussites and subsequently released in return for a high ransom.

==War against Ottomans and death==
In 1428, Zawisza, with his retinue as a commander of a light cavalry banner of 500 horsemen, joined the forces of Sigismund in the king&#x27;s war against the Ottoman Turks. During that disastrous campaign he fought them at the Siege of Golubac on the Danube in modern-day Serbia. Sigismund&#x27;s army was defeated and had to retreat across the Danube, with only a few boats to ferry the troops over to safety. Zawisza&#x27;s banner was guarding the retreating army. Being a man of importance, he was personally sent for by King Sigismund. Disheartened by the king&#x27;s apparent cowardice, he allegedly refused to retreat, saying, &quot;There is no boat big enough to lift my honour.&quot; He was either killed in combat at Golubac or executed in Ottoman captivity.

==Family==
Zawisza was survived by his wife Barbara and their children:
*Marcin, fell at the Battle of Varna in 1444.
*Stanisław, fell at the Battle of Varna in 1444.
*Zawisza (II).
*Jan, starost of Koło, who was killed at the Battle of Chojnice (1454).
*Barbara.

He had a granddaughter, Barbara of Roznow, who was the mother of the Polish Renaissance military commander, hetman Jan Tarnowski. Among further descendants of Zawisza were Stanisław Koniecpolski, Bogusław Radziwiłł, governor of the Duchy of Prussia, and Henryk Dobrzański, the first guerrilla commander in World War II in Europe.

==Legacy==
During his life, he was regarded as a model of knightly virtues. After his death, he was praised by the Polish historian Jan Długosz, the poet and Canon of Gniezno Adam Świnka, and by King Sigismund of Luxembourg. Zawisza became a folk hero in Poland, famed for reliability, and loyalty. The Polish Scouts oath reads partly: &quot;...polegać na nim jak na Zawiszy&quot; (&#x27;[you can] rely on him as on Zawisza&#x27;). Several Polish football clubs and other sports teams were named after him, including, Zawisza Bydgoszcz.

In Serbia, where the Golubac Fortress is located and where he is known as Zaviša Crni ({{lang-sr-Cyr|Завиша Црни}}), he was revered as a brave knight. A monument to Zawisza at Golubac Fortress bears the inscription: &quot;In Golubac, his life was taken by the Turks in 1428, the famous Polish knight, the symbol of courage and honor, Zawisza the Black. Glory to the hero!&quot; Also, in the reconstructed fortress, there is a permanent exhibition celebrating knights who defended the fortress, with a special section dedicated to Zawisza. In Belgrade, Serbian capital, there is a street named after him in the neighborhood of Senjak (&quot;Улица Завише Црног/Ulica Zaviše Crnog&quot;).

Several dramas have been made based on his life.

He appears in the video game Kingdom Come: Deliverance II as a side character

<text>.455 Webley is a British handgun cartridge, most commonly used in the Webley top break revolvers Marks I through VI. It is also known as &quot;.455 Eley&quot; and &quot;.455 Colt&quot;.

The .455 cartridge was a service revolver cartridge, featuring a rimmed cartridge firing a .455 in (11.5 mm) bullet at the relatively low velocity of 650 ft/s (190 m/s). The result was a cartridge and handgun combination with comparatively mild recoil. The .455 MK III &quot;cupped&quot; cartridge was rated superior to the .45 Colt in stopping power in the disputed United States Thompson-LaGarde Tests of 1904 that resulted in the adoption by the U.S. of the .45 ACP cartridge.

The .455 Webley cartridge remained in service with British and Commonwealth forces until the end of the Second World War.

==Variants==
Six main types of .455 ammunition were produced:

* .455 Webley Mk I [11.55×21.7mmR]: Introduced in 1891. 265 grain (17.2 g) solid lead round-nosed bullet propelled by black powder. All subsequent .455 designs used cordite propellant. In 1894 some Mark I cartridges were loaded with cordite (identified by a case cannelure and &quot;C&quot; headstamp) but it was found combustion was more efficient in a shorter case.
* .455 Webley Mk II [11.55×19.3mmR]: Introduced in 1897. 265 grain (17.2 g) solid lead round-nosed bullet propelled by cordite. With the change to cordite propellant, case lengths were reduced. There are minor differences between the Mk I and II bullet shape, though these concern the internal dimensions and so are not immediately apparent.
** (1900-1912) Replaced the Mk III until it was replaced by the Mk IV. The bullet is made of a 12:1 ratio lead-tin alloy.
** (1914-1939) Replaced the Mk V until it was replaced by the Mk VI. The bullet is made of a 99% lead and 1% antimony alloy.
* .455 Webley Mk III [11.55×19.3mmR]: Introduced in 1898. The famous &quot;Manstopper&quot; bullet intended for police, civilian and colonial use. Essentially, the Mk III was a 218 grain lead &quot;hollowpoint&quot; design, propelled by cordite. The cylindrical bullet had hemispherical hollows at each end: one to seal the barrel, the other to deform on impact. This bullet was soon prohibited for use by the military because it was not compliant with the Hague Convention of 1899. The Mark III was withdrawn from service in 1900 and the Mark II was reintroduced.
* .455 Webley Mk IV [11.55×19.3mmR]: Introduced in 1912. 220 grain, flat-nosed wadcutter with cordite propellant. Designed with the goal of producing a more effective bullet than the Mark II without violating the terms of the Hague Convention.
* .455 Webley Mk V [11.55×19.3mmR]: Introduced in 1914. Identical to the Mk IV bullet, but cast from a harder lead-alloy containing more antimony with cordite propellant. This cartridge was only in use from April to November 1914. Upon its withdrawal the Mark II cartridge was returned to service. Remaining stocks were designated for target practice and unloaded cases were loaded with Mark II bullets.
* .455 Webley Mk VI [11.55×19.3mmR]: Introduced in 1939. A 265-grain full-metal-jacketed bullet intended for military purposes, designed to comply with the Hague Conventions. This cartridge was used during World War II. The propellant was cordite or nitro-cellulose. Cordite-loaded cartridges bear a &quot;VI&quot; on the headstamp while nitrocellulose-loaded cartridges are indicated with a &quot;VIz&quot;.

In addition to the Webley revolvers, the British and Canadian armies also ordered several thousand Smith &amp; Wesson .44 Hand Ejector revolvers, chambered in .455 Webley, in a rush to equip their troops for the Great War. The urgency was such that the earliest of these were converted from revolvers already completed and chambered for .44 Special. Approximately 60,000 Colt New Service revolvers were also purchased, in .455.

Commercial manufacturers Fiocchi, PPU, Steinel, and Hornady currently produce the .455 Webley cartridge (in Mk II).

==.455 Webley Auto==
The .455 Webley Auto Mk I cartridge was produced from 1913 to about the middle of World War II. This is a semi-rimmed cartridge for the Webley &amp; Scott Self Loading pistols.

The early version of the cartridge (c.1904) had a shorter semi-rimmed case with a narrow rim and a pointed bullet. A later improved version of the cartridge (c.1910) was similar except it had a long case and a round-nosed bullet. The Mk 1 service round (c.1913) was identical to the 1910 version of the cartridge except it had a thicker rim.

The Mk 1 cartridge&#x27;s bullet headspaced on the rim. It was loaded with a cupro-nickel-jacketed bullet with a muzzle velocity of .

Various submachine-guns were tested using this cartridge, however none were adopted.

===World War One use===
The Webley &amp; Scott pistol was sold to the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Navy during World War I. There were also some Colt M1911 pistols chambered in .455 Auto purchased by the Royal Navy. Although not a standard sidearm or a standard service cartridge, a few Colt M1911 &quot;British service models&quot; chambered in .455 Auto were sold commercially to British navy and army officers through outfitters. The service ammunition came packed in seven-round boxes stamped &quot;not for revolvers&quot; to prevent confusion.

==.476 Enfield==
Despite the apparent difference in calibre name, .476 Enfield was quite similar to the .455 Webley. The .476 had a shorter case than the .455 Mark I and could be fired in weapons regulated and marked as safe for the calibre, such as the Webley &quot;WG Army&quot; model. This had a cylinder that was long enough to accommodate the significantly longer cartridge in which the bullet swelled out to .476&quot; beyond the case. It would not chamber in any government-issue .455 Webley Marks I–VI. The .450 Adams (1868), .476 Enfield (1881), and .455 Webley Mk.I (1891) British service cartridges all featured a case diameter of .476 inch [12.09mm].

<text>August Adolf Eduard Eberhard Kundt (; 18 November 1839 – 21 May 1894) was a German physicist known for developing Kundt&#x27;s tube, an appartus used to measure the speed of sound in gases and solids.

==Early life==
Kundt was born at Schwerin in Mecklenburg. He began his scientific studies at Leipzig, but afterwards went to Berlin University. At first he devoted himself to astronomy, but coming under the influence of H. G. Magnus, he turned his attention to physics, and graduated in 1864 with a thesis on the depolarization of light.

In 1867 he became privatdozent in Berlin University, and in the following year was chosen professor of physics at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zürich, where he was the teacher of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen; then, after a year or two at Würzburg, he was called in 1872 to Strasbourg, where he took a great part in the organization of the new university, and was largely concerned in the erection of the Physical Institute.

Finally in 1888 he went to Berlin as successor to Hermann von Helmholtz in the chair of experimental physics and directorship of the Berlin Physical Institute. He died after a protracted illness at Israelsdorf, near Lübeck, on 21 May 1894.

==Career==
As an original worker, Kundt was especially successful in the domains of sound and light. In 1866, he developed a valuable method for the investigation of aerial waves within pipes, based on the fact that a finely divided powder, lycopodium for example, when dusted over the interior of a tube in which is established a vibrating column of air, tends to collect in heaps at the nodes, the distance between which can thus be ascertained. An extension of the method renders possible the determination of the velocity of sound in different gases. This experimental apparatus is called a Kundt&#x27;s Tube.

In 1876, at Strasbourg in collaboration with Emil Warburg, Kundt proved that mercury vapour is a monatomic gas. In light, Kundt&#x27;s name is widely known for his inquiries in anomalous dispersion, not only in liquids and vapours, but even in metals, which he obtained in very thin films by means of a laborious process of electrolytic deposition upon platinized glass.

He also carried out many experiments in magneto-optics, and succeeded in showing what Faraday had failed to detect, the rotation under the influence of magnetic force of the plane of polarization in certain gases and vapours.

Work was performed by Kundt on plant physiology and chlorophyll light frequencies absorption (Kundt&#x27;s rule), centred on wavelengths of 6800 Å. This work may or may not have been complementary to E. Warburg work and theories. It was subsequently refined and expanded by R. Houston and O. Biermacher and others.

<text>Aleksandr Lukich Ptushko (, – 6 March 1973) was a Soviet animation and fantasy film director, and a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1969). Ptushko is frequently (and somewhat misleadingly) referred to as &quot;the Soviet Walt Disney,&quot; because of his prominent early role in animation in the Soviet Union, though a more accurate comparison would be to Willis H. O&#x27;Brien or Ray Harryhausen. Some critics, such as Tim Lucas and Alan Upchurch, have also compared Ptushko to Italian filmmaker Mario Bava, who made fantasy and horror films with similarities to Ptushko&#x27;s work and made similarly innovative use of color cinematography and special effects. He began his film career as a director and animator of stop motion short films, and became a director of feature-length films combining live action, stop motion, creative special effects, and Russian mythology. Along the way he would be responsible for a number of firsts in Russian film history (including the first feature-length animated film, and the first film in color), and would make several extremely popular and internationally praised films full of visual flair and spectacle.

==Career in film==

===Puppet animation era===
Born as Aleksandr Lukich Ptushkin into a peasant family of Luka Artemyevich Ptushkin and Natalya Semyonovna Ptushkina. He studied in the realschule, then worked as an actor and decorator at the local theater. In 1923 he enrolled into the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics which he finished in 1926.

Aleksandr Ptushko began his film career in 1927 by gaining employment with Moscow&#x27;s Mosfilm studio. He began as a maker of puppets for stop motion animated short films made by other directors, and rapidly became a director of his own series of silent puppet films featuring a character called Bratishkin. From 1928 to 1932, Ptushko designed and directed several of these &quot;Bratishkin shorts.&quot; During these years, Ptushko experimented with various animation techniques, including the combination of puppets and live action in the same frame, and became well known for his skills in cinematic effects work. Virtually all of these short films are now lost.

In 1933, Ptushko, along with the animation crew he had assembled over the years, began work on his first feature film entitled &quot;The New Gulliver&quot;. Written and directed by Ptushko, &quot;The New Gulliver&quot; was one of the world&#x27;s first feature length animated films, and was also one of the first feature-length films to combine stop motion animation with live-action footage. (Many claim that it was &quot;the&quot; first to do this, but Willis H. O&#x27;Brien had made &quot;The Lost World&quot; in 1925 and &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1933. &quot;The New Gulliver&quot; was, however, far more complex, as it featured 3,000 different puppets.) The story, a Communist re-telling of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, is about a young boy who dreams of himself as a version of Gulliver who has landed in Lilliput suffering under capitalist inequality and exploitation. &quot;The New Gulliver&quot; was released in 1935 to widespread acclaim and earned Ptushko a special prize at the International Cinema Festival in Milan.

After the success of &quot;The New Gulliver&quot;, Ptushko was allowed by Mosfilm to set up his own department, which became known as &quot;the Ptushko Collective,&quot; for the making of stop motion animated films. This group of filmmakers would produce another fourteen animated shorts from 1936 to 1938. The direction of these shorts was rarely handled by Ptushko, though he would always act as the artistic supervisor for the group. These shorts were also frequently based on folktales and fairy-tales, a genre which was to become the source of Ptushko&#x27;s greatest success. He personally directed two of them: an adaptation of The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish fairy tale (1937) and Merry Musicians (1938). Both films were made in full color utilizing the newly invented three-color method by the Russian cinematographer Pavel Mershin.

In 1938, Ptushko began work on &quot;The Golden Key&quot;, another feature-length film combining stop motion animation with live action. An adaptation of &quot;The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino&quot; fairy tale by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, which, at the same time, was a retelling of the &quot;Pinocchio&quot; story, it predated the Disney version by two years. The film was also highly successful in the Soviet Union, and did achieve limited released outside the country. Despite its success, &quot;The Golden Key&quot; was to be Ptushko&#x27;s last foray into animation.

During World War II, most of Moscow&#x27;s film community, including Aleksandr Ptushko, were evacuated to Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan. He continued working in special effects, but would not direct another film until the end of the war.

===Mythological epic era===
At the end of World War II, Ptushko returned to Moscow and created his first feature-length folktale adaptation, &quot;The Stone Flower&quot; using the three-color Agfa film stock which had been seized in Germany. It was a more progressive and less complex method of shooting a color film than the one by Pavel Mershin, and the film apparently won a &quot;special prize for the use of color&quot; at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946. With its plotline featuring a focus on character over effects and the use of mythology as a primary source, &quot;The Stone Flower&quot; set the tone for the next twelve years of Ptushko&#x27;s career.

He followed &quot;The Stone Flower&quot; with &quot;Sadko&quot; (the film, which was heavily recut and retitled &quot;The Magic Voyage of Sinbad&quot; for American release, is an adaptation of a Russian &quot;bylina&quot; [epic tale] with no connection to Sinbad), &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; (retitled &quot;The Sword and the Dragon&quot; for American release), and &quot;Sampo&quot; (an adaptation of the Finnish national epic &quot;Kalevala&quot; retitled &quot;The Day the Earth Froze&quot; for American release). Each film in the sequence was a theatrical retelling of epic mythology, and each was extremely visually ambitious. &quot;Sadko&quot; won the &quot;Silver Lion&quot; award at the Venice Film Festival in 1953. &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; was another of Ptushko&#x27;s famous &#x27;firsts&#x27; in Soviet cinema, being the first Soviet film to be made using widescreen photography and stereo sound. &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; is also widely claimed to hold the record for most people and horses ever to be used in a film (the IMDB lists the tagline for the film as: &quot;A cast of 106,000! 11,000 Horses!&quot;).

===Late career===
After &quot;Sampo&quot;, Ptushko briefly abandoned epic fantasy for more realistic scripts. His first work in this vein was &quot;Scarlet Sails&quot;, a romantic adventure story set in the late 19th century. It retained much of the visual power of Ptushko&#x27;s previous films, but greatly reduced the fantastical elements and the amount of special effects whilst focusing on character interaction and development to an extent not seen since &quot;The Stone Flower&quot;. Following &quot;Scarlet Sails&quot;, Ptushko made &quot;A Tale of Time Lost&quot;, a story about children whose youth is stolen by elderly mages, reintroducing a fantastical element. Uniquely for Ptushko, the film featured a modern-day, real world Moscow setting.

In 1966 Ptushko returned to the genre of epic fantasy, creating &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;. In 1968 he began work on the largest film project of his career &quot;Ruslan and Ludmila&quot;, which was also to prove his last. Running for 149 minutes (split into two feature-length segments), &quot;Ruslan and Ludmila&quot; was a film adaptation of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s epic poem of the same name, and was filled with the sumptuous visuals and technical wizardry for which Ptushko had become known. The film took four years to complete, and was released in 1972.

Aleksander Ptushko died a few months after its release, aged 72. He spent his last months writing a script for The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign adaptation which he was going to direct despite already been seriously ill. He was survived by his daughter from the first marriage Natalia Ptushko who worked as an assistant director at Mosfilm.

==American re-edits of Ptushko&#x27;s films==

When Ptushko&#x27;s films were released in the United States, they were dubbed and re-edited, and the names of most of the cast and crew members were replaced with pseudonyms. While these practices were common at the time for releases of foreign films in the United States that were aimed at a mainstream audience, these modifications also served to obscure the Russian origin of these films to improve their commercial prospects during the Cold War.

* Valiant Pictures distributed a version of &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; in 1960 under the title &quot;The Sword and the Dragon&quot;. In this version the total running time was reduced from 95 to 83 minutes, and the stereo soundtrack was removed during the English redub. The character names were also made less &#x27;Russian-sounding&#x27;: &#x27;Svyatogor&#x27; was changed to &#x27;Invincor&#x27;, and &#x27;Vladimir&#x27; to &#x27;Vanda&#x27;. The name &#x27;Ilya Muromets&#x27; was, however, left unchanged.
* Roger Corman&#x27;s Filmgroup released &quot;Sadko&quot; in 1962 under the title &quot;The Magic Voyage of Sinbad&quot;. The Filmgroup version reduced the total running time from 89 to 79 minutes, re-dubbed it into English, and the character name &#x27;Sadko&#x27; was replaced with &#x27;Sinbad.&#x27; Notably, the &quot;Script Adaptor&quot; for this version of the film was a young Francis Ford Coppola. In this opening credits of this version, the direction of the film is credited to &quot;Alfred Posco.&quot;
* American International Pictures released a drastically shortened version of &quot;Sampo&quot; in 1964 retitled &quot;The Day the Earth Froze&quot;. The most heavily altered of the three, &quot;The Day the Earth Froze&quot; had a running time of only 67 minutes, down 24 minutes from the 91 minute runtime of the Soviet original. It was also re-dubbed into English. This film, while not having its character names altered, still had its credits heavily &#x27;de-Russified&#x27;: Ptushko was credited as &quot;Gregg Sebelious,&quot; Andris Oshin was listed in the pressbook as &#x27;Jon Powers&#x27; (and was described as a Finno-Swiss ski-lift attendant), and Eve Kivi was listed as &#x27;Nina Anderson&#x27; (a half Finnish, half American beauty queen, figure skater, and stamp collector).

==Legacy==
===&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;===

The works of Aleksandr Ptushko are now perhaps best known to native English speakers for their inclusion in the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. The three re-edited films from Ptushko&#x27;s epic fantasy period, &quot;The Magic Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, &quot;The Sword and the Dragon&quot;, and &quot;The Day the Earth Froze&quot; were used as fodder for the show&#x27;s humorous wisecracks in its fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons (episodes 422, 505, and 617).

Though it may be considered a dubious distinction for a film to be aired as part of the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; series, it is worth mentioning that the versions of Ptushko&#x27;s films which were used were the heavily re-edited and dubbed versions created specifically for American release, radically different from Ptushko&#x27;s originals in all but their visuals.

It is also worth noting that he has also received some rare praise from the crew; Kevin Murphy, one of the stars of the program, has professed a love for the &quot;breathtaking&quot; visual style and &quot;stunning photography and special effects&quot; of &quot;Sampo&quot; and &quot;Sadko&quot; in multiple interviews (though he erroneously credited Alexander Rou&#x27;s &quot;Jack Frost&quot;, to Ptushko.) Paul Chaplin, another writer of the show, has also expressed admiration.

&quot;Sadko&quot; and &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; have since been fully restored and released on DVD in their original Russian versions by RusCiCo (with English subtitles).

<text>Herbert Sanford Walters (November 17, 1891August 17, 1973) was a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1963 to 1964.

==Early life and education==
Walters was a native of Jefferson County, Tennessee. He was a graduate of the former Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee, and attended Carson–Newman University in Jefferson City, Tennessee, and the University of Tennessee.

== Career ==
Walters earned his fortune as a highly successful contractor in roadbuilding. He became a prominent banker in East Tennessee. He served a term in the Tennessee House of Representatives (1934 to 1936) prior to serving in the state cabinet as Tennessee Commissioner of Highways.

Walters was appointed to the Senate on August 20, 1963, by Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement, upon the death of Senator Estes Kefauver. He was widely viewed as a much more conservative voice than Kefauver, who &quot;was regarded one of the most liberal of Southern Democrats&quot;. Only three months shy of 72 when assuming office, Walters was immediately assumed to be a caretaker who would show no interest in running for the balance of Kefauver&#x27;s term in 1964, which proved to be correct. Political observers felt that Clement took this action in part because he intended to run for the office himself in 1964, which also proved to be correct, but was unwilling to face the consequences of appointing himself to the office in the interim, which would also led to his succession as governor by lieutenant governor Jared Maddux, an event which would have entailed additional consequences of its own. However, Clement failed to capture the Democratic nomination for the seat in the August 1964 Democratic primary, losing to Congressman Ross Bass.

Walters served his time in the Senate rather quietly, very much in the shadow of the state&#x27;s senior senator, Albert Gore, Sr. He supported most of the initiatives of Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, who became President only three months after Walter&#x27;s appointment to the Senate with the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Walters voted against civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Walters&#x27; term of service in the Senate ended on November 3, 1964, immediately after the election of his successor, Ross Bass, which is traditional with appointed senators who do not seek election.

Walters also served as a trustee of the University of Tennessee. A biography of Walters, &quot;The Herbert Walters Story&quot; by author Howard Hill, was published at about the time of his Senate service. Walters is buried at Emma Jarnagin Cemetery in Morristown, Tennessee. Walters State Community College in Morristown is named in his honor. The museum in Morristown&#x27;s Rose Center is named after him.

<text>Number 25 (Fighter) Squadron (alternatively Number XXV (F) Squadron) is a squadron of the Royal Air Force having reformed on 8 September 2018.

During the First World War, No. 25 Squadron operated as a fighter-reconnaissance unit and later as a bomber squadron. Pilots from the Squadron, Cpl. James Henry Waller and 2nd Lt. George Reynolds McCubbin, shot down the famous German fighter ace Max Immelmann in June 1916. In the inter-war years, the Squadron was based at RAF Hawkinge, from where No. 25 Squadron&#x27;s badge originated. Throughout the Second World War, the unit flew both bombers and escorted bombers. In the 1950s, it became a night-fighter squadron. Between 1963 and 1989, No. 25 Squadron operated the Bristol Bloodhound Surface-to-Air Missile from RAF Brüggen, West Germany and later RAF Wyton, Cambridgeshire. The Squadron regained its wings in July 1989, operating the Panavia Tornado F.3 interceptor, these were flown until April 2008 when the Squadron disbanded.

Since reforming in 2018, No. 25 Squadron operates the BAE Systems Hawk T.2. It provides Advanced Fast Jet Training (AFJT) for pilots of the RAF and Royal Navy, as part of No. 4 Flying Training School at RAF Valley.

==History==
===First World War===
No. 25 Squadron was initially formed as part of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) at Montrose, Scotland on 25 September 1915, from a nucleus provided by No. 6 (Reserve) Squadron. Upon its formation, the Squadron operated numerous types such as the Maurice Farman MF.11 Shorthorn and the Avro 504. No. 25 Squadron relocated to Barnham, Norfolk on 31 December and shortly after were equipped with the Vickers F.B.5, these however were exchanged for the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b by February. The Squadron was deployed to the RFC HQ at Saint-Omer, France on 20 February, as a long-range reconnaissance and fighter unit. No. 25 Squadron was initially tasked with intercepting German aircraft, operating in the routes taken by the Luftstreitkräfte on their way to raid England. However this was proven to be ineffective and the Squadron was transferred in order to protect General Headquarters and Audruicq, flying sorties with No. 21 Squadron.

On 1 April, the Squadron relocated to the aerodrome at Auchel, operating alongside No. 18 Squadron and No. 27 Squadron. From here the Squadron supported the British 1st Army near Fromelles and Souchez. In June 1916, in preparation for the Somme Offensive, the Squadron had its ranked bolstered to 18 machines, 20 pilots and 18 observers. In the prelude to the battle, No. 25 Squadron flew reconnaissance and bombing missions behind enemy lines. On 18 June, Cpl. James Henry Waller, and his pilot 2nd Lt. George Reynolds McCubbin, shot down famous German ace Max Immelmann. This occurred during No. 25 Squadron&#x27;s second encounter with Immelmann that day, after he previously shot down Lt. C. E. Rogers for his 16th victory. Immelmann, flying a Fokker E.III, engaged No. 25 Squadron over Lens and subsequently shot down Lt. J. R. B. Savage before closing in on McCubbin&#x27;s F.E.2b, whose gunner, Waller, opened fire and shot him down. For their accomplishment, McCubbin was awarded the Distinguished Service Order while Waller was promoted to Sergeant and received the Distinguished Service Medal. When the offensive started on 1 July, No. 25 Squadron started flying night time bombing missions. It started operating D.H.4 bombers in June 1917.

During the course of the First World War, 25 Squadron had nine flying aces among its ranks, including James Fitz-Morris, James Green, Reginald George Malcolm, Lancelot Richardson, Noel Webb, Charles Woollven Alexander Roulstone, Leonard Herbert Emsden, and Hartley Pullan.

===Interwar years===

After the war the squadron acquired D.H.9s. The unit was disbanded on 31 January 1920 at RAF Scopwick. The squadron reformed the next day at RAF Hawkinge, flying Snipes, and went to Turkey in 1922/23 during the Chanak Crisis. After returning to the UK the unit stayed for a number of years at Hawkinge. The Snipes gave way to Grebes and later Siskins, while in December 1936 the squadron became the first unit to receive the Hawker Fury Mk II, having already flown the Fury Mk I since 1932. The Fury was replaced by the Hawker Demon when the squadron was given a night-fighter role. For night-flying training purposes the squadron also received Gloster Gladiators.

===Second World War===
No. 25(F) Squadron moved to RAF Northolt on 12 September 1938. During World War II it flew Blenheims on night patrols, which were replaced by Beaufighters and later Mosquitos. By the closing stages of the war, the squadron was almost entirely committed to bomber escort missions. The squadron was particularly successful during Operation Steinbock from January to May 1944.

===Cold War===

After the war No. 25 Squadron continued to operate the Mosquito NF.30 night fighter from their base at RAF West Malling until November 1951, when they were replaced by jet powered De Havilland Vampire NF.10, conversion to type having commenced in February 1951. The Vampires were then replaced by Gloster Meteor NF Mk.12 and 14s in March 1954. In 1957 the squadron moved from West Malling to RAF Tangmere, where it disbanded on 23 June 1958. On 1 July 1958 No. 153 Squadron RAF was renumbered No. 25 Squadron and the squadron flew Meteors until their replacement in 1959 by the Gloster Javelin FAW Mk.7s.

===The Bloodhound missile years===
No. 25 Squadron disbanded again on 30 November 1962, reforming a year later as the RAF&#x27;s first Bristol Bloodhound SAM unit, based at RAF North Coates. In this role the squadron moved to RAF Bruggen in 1970, with detachments also protecting RAF Laarbruch and RAF Wildenrath. In 1983 the squadron moved to RAF Wyton, similarly protecting RAF Barkston Heath and RAF Wattisham.

===On Tornados===

The RAF withdrew the Bloodhound from 25 Squadron in October 1989 and the squadron immediately reformed at RAF Leeming as a RAF Tornado F3 fighter squadron, which became operational in January 1990, alongside 11 Squadron and 23 Squadron as part of No. 11 Group RAF. Between September – December 1993 and May – August 1995, No. 25 (F) Squadron aircrew and groundcrew took part in Operation Deny Flight, a NATO-led operation enforcing the United Nations (UN) no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Operating out of Gioia del Colle Air Base near Bari, Italy, on each occasion the squadron took over responsibility for supporting the no-fly zone from 23 Squadron before being relieved by 5 Squadron from RAF Coningsby. In the late 1990s the squadron deployed operationally to Saudi Arabia to protect the Shi&#x27;ite Muslims of southern Iraq by flying Combat Air Patrol missions below the 33rd parallel, enforcing the southern no-fly zone imposed by Operation Southern Watch. Between October 2004 and January 2005 a contingent of 4 aircraft from 25(F) Sqn was deployed to Siauliana Air Base in Lithuania to provide NATO Air Defence cover to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, following their membership of NATO. Within the United Kingdom the Squadron&#x27;s primary role, along with 11(F) Sqn prior to their disbandment, was QRA(S), Quick Reaction Alert (South), providing air defence for the Southern UK. Most publicly the Squadron intercepted eight Russian Tu-95 Bear-H strategic bombers and two Tu-160 Blackjack strategic bombers in July 2007. The squadron disbanded on 4 April 2008, its Tornados relocating to RAF Leuchars to join the remaining active Tornado F3 squadrons stationed there.
===Advanced flying training===
In August 2018, it was announced that, due to the increased demand for fast jet pilots in both the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm following the entry into service of the F-35B Lightning, the existing Hawk T.2 squadron at 4 FTS would be split into two, with No. IV (AC) Squadron to be joined by a newly reformed No. 25 Squadron by the end of 2018. No. 25 Squadron will takeover the jet conversion tasks, with No. IV Squadron focusing on tactics and weapons training.

<doc id="1064325" wikidata="Q16994477" url="?curid=1064325" title="Silver dollar (fish)">
<text>Silver dollar is a common name given to a number of species of fishes, mostly in the genus &quot;Metynnis&quot;, tropical fish belonging to the family Serrasalmidae which are closely related to piranha and pacu. Most commonly, the name refers to &quot;Metynnis argenteus&quot;. Native to South America, these somewhat round-shaped silver fish are popular with fish-keeping hobbyists.

The silver dollar is a peaceful schooling species that spends most of its time in the mid- to upper-level of the water. Its average lifespan is less than ten years but can live longer in captivity. A benthic spawner and egg scatterer, the adult fish will spawn around 2,000 eggs. This breeding occurs in soft, warm water in low light.

Silver dollars natively live in a tropical climate in the sides of weedy rivers. They prefer water with a pH of 5–7, a water hardness of up to 15 dGH, and an ideal temperature range of 24–28 °C (75–82 °F). Their diet is almost exclusively vegetarian and in captivity they will often eat all the plants in a tank. They will also eat worms and small insects.

== Fish compatibility ==
The silver dollar is listed as semi-aggressive but some silver dollars can be very mellow. These fish can be kept in community tanks with fish that can&#x27;t fit in their mouths, and once fully grown, they can be kept with larger fish like oscars, pikes, and larger catfish.

== Breeding ==

The best way to acquire a breeding pair is to purchase a half dozen juvenile silver dollars and raise them together. The parents will not consume the eggs or fry, although other fish will, so when spawning them it is wise to place them in a separate tank. To facilitate spawning, make sure the water is soft (8 dgH or below) and warm (80 to 82 F), keep the lighting dim, and provide fine-leaved plants.

Eventually a pair will spawn, and the female will lay up to 2000 eggs. The eggs will fall to the bottom of the tank, where they will hatch in three days. After approximately a week, the fry will be free swimming and able to eat fine foods such as commercially prepared fry food, finely-crushed spirulina, or freshly-hatched brine shrimp.

<text>Sandycove () is a suburb of Dublin, Ireland. It is southeast of Dún Laoghaire and Glasthule, and northwest of Dalkey. It is a popular seaside resort and is well known for its bathing place, the Forty Foot, which in the past was reserved for men only but is now available for mixed bathing. The locale features in the opening of &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce.

==History==

On 20 December 1940, during World War II, the Luftwaffe bombed the railway station even though Ireland was a neutral country. There were three injuries.

==Transport==
Sandycove and Glasthule railway station opened on 11 October 1855. Sandycove is also serviced by Dublin Bus numbers 59 and 111, and lies close to Dún Laoghaire harbour.

==Culture==
The writer James Joyce lived for a week as a young man in the Martello Tower situated beside the Forty Foot bathing place at Sandycove. The opening scene of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; is set in this tower. It now hosts a small Joycean museum, open all year round. Bloomsday is celebrated in Sandycove in Joyce&#x27;s honour on the 16th of June every year.

Near the tower, on the seafront, is the unique landmark house designed in the Avant Garde style by Michael Scott, the eminent 20th-century architect, who made it his residence.

The ballad &quot;Sandy Cove&quot; (sic) by composer/singer Jimmy Webb appears on his 1993 album &quot;Suspending Disbelief&quot;. In the song, the narrator reflects on his life&#x27;s choices and his as he visits the neighbourhood and the famed Martello Tower.

Singer-songwriter Luka Bloom, in the liner notes to his 1992 album, &quot;The Acoustic Motorbike&quot; thanks Sandcove Cycles for maintaining the titular bicycle.

==Lifeboat==
The first lifeboat station in Ireland was established at Sandycove in 1803. On 28 December 1821, the lifeboat rescued the crew of the brig &quot;Ellen of Liverpool&quot;; four volunteer lifeboatmen drowned.

==Notable residents==
* Roger Casement was born in Sandycove
* Bernard Farrell, playwright
* Peter Gatenby, Professor and Medical Director for the UN, lived in Sandycove.

<doc id="1064337" wikidata="Q446423" url="?curid=1064337" title="Florence Eldridge">
<text>Florence Eldridge (born Florence McKechnie, September 5, 1901 – August 1, 1988) was an American actress. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 1957 for her performance in &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;.

==Early years==
Eldridge was born Florence McKechnie in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Charles J. McKechnie. She attended public schools, including P.S. 85 and Girls&#x27; High School.

==Stage==
Eldridge made her Broadway debut at age 17 as a chorus member of &quot;Rock-a-Bye Baby&quot; at the Astor Theatre. The reference book &quot;American Theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama, 1930–1969&quot; noted, &quot;In the 1920s she won major attention in such plays as &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; and &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;.&quot;

In 1965, she and her husband Fredric March did a world tour under the auspices of the U.S. State Department. Eldridge wrote that they were &quot;experimenting to see if an acting couple doing excerpts from plays on a bare stage could reach and appeal to a worldwide audience.&quot;

==Personal life==
On March 19, 1921, Eldridge married Howard Rumsey, who owned the Empire Theater and the Knickerbocker Players (both in Syracuse) and the Manhattan Players of Rochester. They were wed at her aunt&#x27;s home in Maplewood, New Jersey.

She was married to Fredric March from 1927 until his death in 1975, and appeared alongside him on stage and in seven films. They adopted two children, Penelope and Anthony. Like her husband, she was a liberal Democrat.

<text>Rathmines (; ) is an inner suburb on the Southside of Dublin in Ireland. It begins at the southern side of the Grand Canal and stretches along the Rathmines Road as far as Rathgar to the south, Ranelagh to the east, and Harold&#x27;s Cross to the west. It is situated in the city&#x27;s D06 postal district.

Rathmines is a commercial and social hub and was well known across Ireland as &quot;Flatland&quot;—an area where subdivided large Georgian and Victorian houses provided rented accommodation to newly arrived junior civil servants and third-level students from outside the city from the 1930s. However, in more recent times, Rathmines has diversified its housing stock and many historic houses formerly divided into often tiny flats and bedsits have in a process of gentrifying been re-amalgamated into single-family homes. Rathmines gained a reputation as a &quot;Dublin Belgravia&quot; in the 19th Century.

==Name==
Rathmines is an Anglicisation of the Irish , meaning &quot;ringfort of Maonas&quot;/&quot;fort of Maonas&quot;. The name Maonas is perhaps derived from Maoghnes or the Norman name de Meones, after the de Meones family who settled in Dublin about 1280; Elrington Ball states that the earlier version of the name was &quot;Meonesrath&quot;, which supports the theory that it was named after the family. Like many of the surrounding areas, it arose from a fortified structure which would have been the centre of civic and commercial activity from the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century. Rathgar, Baggotrath and Rathfarnham are other areas of Dublin whose placenames derive from a similar root.

==History==

===Origins===

Rathmines has a history stretching back to the 14th century. At this time, Rathmines and the surrounding hinterland were part of the ecclesiastical lands called &quot;Cuallu&quot; or &quot;Cuallan&quot;, later the vast Parish of Cullenswood, which gave its name to a nearby area. Cuallu is mentioned in local surveys from 1326 as part of the manor of St. Sepulchre (the estate, or rather liberty, of the Archbishop of Dublin, whose seat as a Canon of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral takes its name from this). There is some evidence of an established settlement around a &quot;rath&quot; as far back as 1350. Rathmines is part of the Barony of Uppercross, one of the many baronies surrounding the old city of Dublin, bound as it was by walls, some of which are still visible. In more recent times, Rathmines was a popular suburb of Dublin, attracting the wealthy and powerful seeking refuge from the poor living conditions of the city from the middle of the 19th century. A substantial mansion, generally called Rathmines Old Castle, was built in the seventeenth century, probably at present-day Palmerston Park, and rebuilt in the eighteenth; no trace of it survives today.

Rathmines is arguably best known historically for a bloody battle that took place there in 1649, during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, leading to the death of perhaps up to 5,000 people. The Battle of Rathmines took place on 2 August 1649 and led to the routing of Royalist forces in Ireland shortly after this time. Some have compared the Battle of Rathmines – or sometimes Baggotrath – as equal in political importance to England&#x27;s Battle of Naseby. The battle brought a swift end to the ongoing Royalist Siege of Dublin.

In the early 1790s, the Grand Canal was constructed on the northern edge of Rathmines, connecting Rathmines with Portobello via the La Touch Bridge (which through popular usage became better known as Portobello Bridge).

For several hundred years Rathmines was the location of a &quot;spa&quot; – in fact, a spring – the water of which was said to have health-giving properties. It attracted people with all manner of ailments to the area. In the 19th century, it was called the &quot;Grattan Spa&quot;, as it was located on property once belonging to Henry Grattan, close to Portobello Bridge. The &quot;spa&quot; gradually fell into a state of neglect as the century progressed, until disputes arose between those who wished to preserve it and those (mainly developers) who wished to get rid of it altogether. In 1872 a Dr. O&#x27;Leary, who held a high estimate of the water quality, reported that the &quot;spa&quot; was in &quot;a most disgraceful state of repair&quot;, upon which the developer and alderman Frederick Stokes sent samples to the medical inspector, Dr. Cameron, for analysis. Dr. Cameron, a great lover of authority, reported: &quot;It was, in all probability, merely the drainings of some ancient disused sewer, not a chalybeate spring.&quot; Access to the site was blocked up and the once popular &quot;spa&quot; faded from public memory.

Dublin Rathmines was a parliamentary county constituency at Westminster from 1918 to 1922. It returned Unionist candidate Maurice Dockrell as its MP in 1918, elected on a majority. Dockrell was the only Unionist elected in a geographical constituency outside Ulster.
===Easter Rising, War of Independence &amp; Civil War===
On 25 April 1916, during the Easter Rising, Captain John Bowen-Colthurst, an officer of the 3rd battalion Royal Irish Rifles, went on a raiding party in Rathmines holding Francis Sheehy-Skeffington as hostage. At Rathmines Road, he shot dead 19-year-old James Joseph Coade of 28 Mountpleasant Avenue. Coade had been attending a Sodality meeting at the nearby Catholic Church of Our Lady of Refuge. Sheehy-Skeffington was later shot dead in Portobello Barracks.

Rathmines Church was used as a weapons store during the War of Independence. On 26 January 1920, a fire started at the electrical switchboard in the vestry. There were reports of several members of &#x27;A&#x27; Company of the IRA Dublin Brigade entering the church during the fire to retrieve the weapons. The fire caused £30-35,000 worth of damage and completely destroyed the dome.

During the Irish Civil War on 20 December 1922 Séamus Dwyer, a pro-treaty Sinn Féin politician, was shot dead in his shop at 5 Rathmines Terrace. On 23 March 1923 Thomas O&#x27;Leary, a member of the anti-Treaty IRA, was found dead and riddled with bullets outside of Tranquilla Convent (now Tranquilla Park). In 1933 a Celtic cross was erected in his memory at the location.

On 28 January 1928, IRA assassin Timothy Coughlin was himself shot dead on the Dartry Road.

===Rathmines Township===

The Rathmines Township was created by an Act of Parliament in 1847. The area was later renamed Rathmines and Rathgar and expanded to take in the areas of Rathgar, Ranelagh, Sallymount and Milltown. The township was initially responsible only for sanitation, but its powers were extended over time to cover most functions of local government. It became an urban district under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, but was still usually called a &quot;township&quot;. Initially, the council was made up of local businessmen and other eminent figures; the franchise was extended in 1899 and the membership changed accordingly.

Rathmines Town Hall is still one of Rathmines&#x27;s most prominent buildings with its clock tower (because the clock is famously inaccurate and has four large apparently unsynchronised clock faces (i.e., they sometimes show different times), it is known locally as the &quot;Four Faced Liar&quot;.)

The township was incorporated into the City of Dublin in 1930, and its functions were taken over by Dublin Corporation, now known as Dublin City Council. Kimmage–Rathmines is a local electoral area of Dublin City Council, electing six councillors; the boundaries of the electoral areas in Rathmines have varied over the years.

==Places of interest==
Cathal Brugha Barracks (known in the past as Portobello Barracks) is a large army barracks which is home to many units of the Irish Army including, the 2 Brigade and the 7th Infantry Battalion. Portobello GAA are based on their pitch on Leinster Road and fields adult teams in Gaelic football and hurling which serve Rathmines for GAA.

Rathmines Library was opened on 24 October 1913 following a grant of £8,500 from Andrew Carnegie, to a design by architect, Frederick Hicks.

==Churches==

The green copper oxide dome of Mary Immaculate, Refuge of Sinners Church is a prominent landmark. The original dome was destroyed in a fire in 1920 and replaced by the current one when reopened in 1922. The dome was to be used in St Petersburg but the political and social upheaval in that city caused it to be diverted to Dublin.

The Holy Trinity Church (Church of Ireland) was designed by John Semple (1801–1882) in the Gothic Revival style and consecrated on 1 June 1828. Constructed of Black Calp, a local limestone that turns black in the rain, the Church was one of two in Dublin to be known as the &#x27;Black Church,&#x27; (the other also being designed by Semple and in St. Mary&#x27;s Place).

Rathmines is also the location of Grosvenor Road Baptist Church.

==Education==
There are primary and secondary schools, St Mary&#x27;s College (C.S.Sp.) and St Louis Primary and St Louis Secondary School, Rathmines. On Upper Rathmines Road there is a Church of Ireland sponsored primary school called Kildare Place National School, situated on the grounds of the former Church of Ireland College of Education. Rathmines College of Further Education is located in the Town Hall.

==Retail==
On 14 September 2014, the old Swan cinema was upgraded, refurbished, and enhanced, at a cost of nearly €8 million. From the original seating capacity of 258, it was expanded to 1,519, over a total of eight movie screens. This has multiple screens, it shows up-to-date movies and features 3D movies. In October 2017, the Stella Cinema, a vintage cinema popular in the 1980s was refurbished and reopened, offering classic films and blockbusters.

==Transport==
From the 1850s, horse-drawn omnibuses provided transport from Rathmines to the city centre. Portobello Bridge, which had a steep incline, was often a problem for the horses, which led to the fatal accident of 1861.

On 6 October 1871 work was commenced on the Dublin tram system on Rathmines Road, just before Portobello Bridge, and a horse-drawn tram service was in place the following year. The following year also the long-awaited (since the 1861 accident) improvements to Portobello Bridge were carried out, the Tramway Company paying one-third of the total cost of £300.

Rathmines was once served by Rathmines and Ranelagh railway station on the Harcourt Street railway line. The station opened on 16 July 1896 and finally closed on 1 January 1959.

Today Rathmines is served by the Luas light rail system: Ranelagh on the Green Line is the most convenient for access to the main street, while the Charlemont, Beechwood (which is near the former railway station) and Cowper stops are also within walking distance of the area.

Dublin Bus routes S2, 14, 15, 15A, 15B, 65, 65B, 83, 140 and 142 serve Rathmines. The area is also served by the Dublin Bus &quot;Nitelink&quot; routes 15N and 49N on Friday and Saturday nights and on public holidays.

<doc id="1064349" wikidata="Q1353589" url="?curid=1064349" title="Patrick Smith (politician)">
<text>Patrick Smith (17 July 1901 – 18 March 1982) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician, who served as a Teachta Dála from 1923 until 1977; a tenure of 53 years, the longest in the state. He held a number of ministerial positions within the governments of Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass.

==Early life==
Smith was born in the town of Bailieborough, County Cavan, the eighth and youngest child of Terence Smith, a farmer, and Ellen Smith (née MacManus). He joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, he took a small role in the Easter Rising of 1916. By 1920, he was involved with the Irish Republican Army and was one of its youngest commandants, at the age of 19. He was captured by British forces in 1921, along with Seán Moylan, who would go on to become a government colleague. He was interned, put on trial for treason but he was spared after a truce was called between the British Army and the IRA during the Irish War of Independence. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Smith sided with de Valera and the Anti-Treaty side of the Irish Civil War. Smith had felt that the Irish negotiators did not test the British delegation enough, this sentiment would last with him well into his political career, Smith being said to have shouted across the floor at Dáil Éireann, &quot;They gave us stepping-stones, but they [state forces in 1922] would not walk on them&quot; (a quote from Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins).

==Irish politics==
He entered the Dáil in September 1923, as a Republican candidate. In 1926, Éamon de Valera, the Leader of Anti-Treaty Sinn Fein, approached Smith and persuaded him to join his newly founded political party, Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fail abandoned the abstentionist policy of Anti Treaty Sinn Fein and its elected members took their seats in Dáil Éireann. De Valera and Smith had a strong personal and professional relationship; Smith had a strong loyalty for Fianna Fail and by extension, de Valera, whom he often defended from allegations of totalitarian style policies. Smith refuted these allegations, citing that he felt de Valera had always given a voice to members of the party. He worked as Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach (Government Chief Whip). Smith identified this time during World War II as his most fulfilling period in Irish politics.

He was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in 1943. He served under Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly and Frank Aiken during his tenure in the department. He was briefly Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture in January 1947, before his appointment as Minister for Agriculture later that month during which time he oversaw the introduction of legislation on arterial drainage. He held this position until the collapse of the Fianna Fáil government which had been in power for nearly 16 years. The party was in opposition until the 1951 Irish general election. Smith was then appointed as Minister for Local Government. Smith focused on many social issues, especially the tuberculosis issue in Ireland. He advocated for the reduction of overcrowding in the slums of Dublin. He also oversaw the doubling of the car license fee to ensure the government had enough cashflow for the upkeep of urban and rural roads. The improvement of roads also facilitated unemployment programs by offering recruitment opportunities to work on the roads. The fund for road improvement soon amounted to £3 million, and work began on surfacing the 34,000 miles of road which remained below standard. The Fianna Fail government collapsed in 1954 and was replaced by the Second Inter-Party Government, led by John A. Costello; Smith returned to the position of Minister for Local Government when Fianna Fail were re-elected at the 1957 Irish general election.

Smith was appointed again as Minister for Agriculture in 1957 when Fianna Fail returned to government. His main objectives while in this office were to eliminate cattle tuberculosis, which proved to be a serious issue for Irish farmers at the time. He also encouraged greater productivity from the primary economic sector, specifically farming and also aimed to improve grassland quality across the island. Outside of agriculture, Smith continued to serve as Minister for Local Government. He also was part of a group of ministers who supervised the &quot;First Programme for Economic Expansion&quot;, an economic development plan by T. K. Whitaker, Secretary at the Department of Finance, that has been heavily praised as the programme that helped kickstart Ireland&#x27;s economic growth which would take full form in the mid-1990s. He also had a spell as Minister for Social Welfare.

Smith continued to serve under Seán Lemass, but became disillusioned with the Taoiseach about the direction of his economic policy. Smith felt Lemass was too easily influenced by trade unions and in protest he resigned from all his ministerial positions in 1964. On that same day Lemass appointed his Parliamentary Secretary, Charles J. Haughey, as Minister for Agriculture in his place. The result was as Lemass predicted that the Irish media focused on the new appointment rather than the resignation. It is a point, however, that Seán MacEntee tendered several resignation letters to Eamon de Valera during the course of his Ministerial Career which were not enacted but were dealt with among the Cabinet of the day. It is possible that Smith may have felt that he was challenging Lemass with his resignation but he enacted it and he remained in the parliamentary party which he had founded. Accordingly Smith was not appointed to cabinet by Jack Lynch upon his succession as Taoiseach in 1966 and would spend the remainder of his parliamentary career on the Fianna Fáil backbenches. During the Arms Crisis, together with Aiken and almost all of the founding members of Fianna Fail, sided with Lynch against Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. Smith retired from politics in 1977 at the age of 75. At the time of his retirement from the Dáil his record of 54 unbroken years of service for his constituents has been unsurpassed by any TD before or since.

Smith died on 18 March 1982, aged 80, at his home in Castleblayney, County Monaghan. He was survived by his wife, Mary Ward and his 6 children. His body was returned to his ancestral parish of Knockbride, a townland outside of Bailieborough, County Cavan. He was buried in West Knockbride Chapel, with his graveside oration given by Charles Haughey, who had been appointed Taoiseach a number of days earlier.

<text>dnd is a role-playing video game. The name &quot;dnd&quot; is derived from the abbreviation &quot;D&amp;D&quot; from the original tabletop role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which was released in 1974.

&quot;dnd&quot; was written in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO system by Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood at Southern Illinois University in 1974 and 1975. Dirk Pellett of Iowa State University and Flint Pellett of the University of Illinois made substantial enhancements to the game from 1976 to 1985.

&quot;dnd&quot; is notable for being the first interactive game to feature what would later be referred to as bosses.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;dnd&quot;, players create a character and venture into the multi-level Whisenwood Dungeon (a portmanteau of the authors&#x27; last names) in search of two ultimate treasures: the grail and the orb. The game presents players with an overhead view of the dungeon, but also implements many basic concepts of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The Whisenwood dungeon consists of multiple maze-like levels. As players complete each level, they are allowed to advance to the next, but the players may return to previous levels and leave the dungeon altogether making &quot;dnd&quot; one of the first video games to use non-linear progression. As players complete levels, they acquire new spells, weapons and items that aid them in their quest to find the ultimate treasures.

Teleporters move characters between dungeon levels. High-level monsters, including a Golden Dragon that guards the Orb, are found at the end of each dungeon. Leaving the dungeon allows one to recuperate and regain spells and return later.

<text>A thaumatrope is an optical toy that was popular in the 19th century. A disk with a picture on each side is attached to two pieces of string. When the strings are twirled quickly between the fingers the two pictures appear to blend into one. The toy has traditionally been thought to demonstrate the principle of persistence of vision, a disputed explanation for the cause of illusory motion in stroboscopic animation and film.

Examples of common thaumatrope pictures include a bare tree on one side of the disk, and its leaves on the other, or a bird on one side and a cage on the other. Many classic thaumatropes also included riddles or short poems, with one line on each side.

Thaumatropes can provide an illusion of motion with the two sides of the disc each depicting a different phase of the motion, but no examples are known to have been produced until long after the introduction of the first widespread animation device: the phenakistiscope

Thaumatropes are often seen as important antecedents of motion pictures and in particular of animation. 

The name translates roughly as &quot;wonder turner&quot;, from &quot;wonder&quot; and τρόπος &quot;turn&quot;.

==Invention==

A 2012 paper argues that a prehistoric bone disk found in the Laugerie-Basse rockshelter is a thaumatrope, designed to be spun using leather thongs threaded through the central perforation.

The invention of the thaumatrope is usually credited to British physician John Ayrton Paris. He described the device in his 1827 educational book for children &quot;Philosophy in Sport Made Science in Earnest&quot;, with an illustration by George Cruikshank.

British mathematician Charles Babbage recalled in 1864 that the thaumatrope was invented by the geologist William Henry Fitton. Babbage had told Fitton how the astronomer John Herschel had challenged him to show both sides of a shilling at once. Babbage held the coin in front of a mirror, but Herschel showed how both sides were visible when the coin was spun on the table. A few days later Fitton brought Babbage a new illustration of the principle, consisting of a round disc of card suspended between two pieces of sewing silk. This disc had a parrot on one side and a cage at the other side. Babbage and Fitton made several different designs and amused some friends with them for a short while. They forgot about it until some months later they heard about the &quot;wonderful invention of Dr. Paris&quot;.

French artist Antoine Claudet stated in 1867 that he had heard that Paris had once been present when Herschel demonstrated his rotating coin trick to his children and subsequently got the idea for the thaumatrope. 

Claudet also noted in 1867 that the thaumatrope could create a three-dimensional illusion. A spinning rectangular thaumatrope with the alternating letters of the name &quot;Victoria&quot; on each side, showed the full word with the letters at two different distances from the observer&#x27;s eye. If the two strings of the thaumatrope are attached to the same side of the card the thickness of the card accounts for a small difference in the distances when each side is visible.

==Commercial production==

The first commercial thaumatrope was registered at Stationers&#x27; Hall on 2 April 1825 and published by W. Phillips in London as &quot;The Thaumatrope; being Rounds of Amusement or How to Please and Surprise By Turns&quot;, sold in boxes of 12 or 18 discs. It included a sheet with mottoes or riddles for each disc, often with a political meaning. Paris was widely regarded as the author, but wasn&#x27;t mentioned on the product or its packaging and he later claimed in a letter to Michael Faraday &quot;I was first induced to publish it, at the earnest desire of my late friend Wm Phillips. (...) I may add that I never put my name to it&quot;.

The steep price of a set (seven shilling for 12 discs or half a guinea for 18) was criticized, half a guinea would have been about a week&#x27;s pay for an average worker. It was also defended: its inventor should be able to earn something from his invention while it was new, before it was widely copied as seen before with the kaleidoscope. 
Paris later claimed he gained £150,- from its sales in the United Kingdom.

As expected, pirate copies soon became common and were much cheaper. For instance the &#x27;Thaumatropical Amusement&#x27; was available in boxes of six discs for one shilling.

Although the toy became very popular, original copies are now very rare; only one extant set produced by W. Phillips is currently known (in the Richard Balzer collection) and one single disc is at the Cinématheque Française.

Other early publishers across the continent included Alphonse Giroux &amp; Compagnie in France and Trentsensky in Austria. In 1833 these companies would be the very first publishers of the next big &quot;philosophical toy&quot; craze: the Phénakisticope.

==Animation==
In the first 1827 edition of &quot;Philosophy in Sport&quot; John Ayrton Paris described a version with a circular frame around the disc through which the strings were threaded. A little tug on the strings would cause a minor change in the axis of rotation and thus a slight shift in the position of the images while revolving. An adapted version of the standard horse and jockey thaumatrope could thus first show the jockey on the horse before being thrown over its head. In a new 1833 edition of the book this example was replaced with a version without a ring but with an elastic string added to change the axis by pulling it. This version showed a drinking man lowering and raising a bottle to and from his mouth, with an illustration of the different sides of the disc and the different states of the resulting image. Several other examples were described in the book. The balls of a juggler could appear as in motion and the two painted balls could be seen as three or four when the axis of rotation was shifted. A tailor in a pulpit next to a pond with a goose fluttering in the water would have the tailor falling into the water and the goose taking his place in the pulpit. No commercially produced versions with these techniques are known. 

On 26 November 1869 the Rev. Richard Pilkington received &quot;Useful Registered Design Number 5074&quot; for his &quot;Pedemascope&quot;. This was a variation of the thaumatrope. It had a card with pictures &quot;painted in two different positions on both sides&quot;. This card was placed in the two-part mahogany holder with a handle and a brass pin that would semi-rotate the card when it was twirled (a bit of iron preventing full rotation). Transparent or cut-out variations were suggested for use with the magic lantern. 

In 1892 mechanical engineer Thomas E. Bickle received British Patent No. 20,281 for a clockwork thaumatrope with &quot;pictures or designs exhibiting some action or motion in two phases, which are thus alternately presented to the eye in rapid succession with small intervals of rest&quot;.

==Thaumatropes in popular culture==
The 1827 book &quot;Philosophy in Sport made Science in Earnest, being an attempt to illustrate the first principles of natural philosophy by the aid of popular toys and sports&quot; featured the thaumatrope and warned against inferior copies. The chapter head was illustrated with a drawing by George Cruikshank, depicting a man demonstrating the thaumatrope to a girl and a boy. It was first published anonymously, but posthumous editions were credited to John Ayrton Paris.

In the 1999 Tim Burton film &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, a bird and cage thaumatrope is demonstrated by Johnny Depp&#x27;s character.

In the 2006 Christopher Nolan film &quot;The Prestige&quot;, Michael Caine&#x27;s character repeatedly uses a thaumatrope as a way of explaining persistence of vision.

In the 2011 Martin Scorsese film &quot;Hugo&quot;, the final scene begins in the middle of a conversation about cinema precursors, including the thaumatrope.

In the 2013 video game &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; the bird and the cage thaumatrope is used several times.

In the 2022 film &quot;The Wonder&quot;, a thaumatrope is featured frequently throughout the film.

In the 2023 film &quot;Gaslight&quot;, a thaumatrope is used.

<doc id="1064373" wikidata="Q901141" url="?curid=1064373" title="Prenylation">
<text>Prenylation (also known as isoprenylation or lipidation) is the addition of hydrophobic molecules to a protein or a biomolecule. It is usually assumed that prenyl groups (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl) facilitate attachment to cell membranes, similar to lipid anchors like the GPI anchor, though direct evidence of this has not been observed. Prenyl groups (also called isoprenyl groups, having one hydrogen atom more than isoprene) have been shown to be important for protein–protein binding through specialized prenyl-binding domains.

== Protein prenylation ==
Protein prenylation involves the transfer of either a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl moiety to C-terminal cysteine(s) of the target protein. There are three enzymes that carry out prenylation in the cell, farnesyl transferase, Caax protease and geranylgeranyl transferase I.

Farnesylation is a type of prenylation, a post-translational modification of proteins by which an isoprenyl group is added to a cysteine residue. It is an important process to mediate protein–protein interactions and protein–membrane interactions.

=== Prenylation sites ===
There are at least 3 types of sites that are recognized by prenylation enzymes. The CaaX motif is found at the COOH-terminus of proteins, such as lamins or Ras. The motif consists of a cysteine (C), two aliphatic amino acids (&quot;aa&quot;) and some other terminal amino acid (&quot;X&quot;). If the X position is serine, alanine, or methionine, the protein is farnesylated. For instance, in rhodopsin kinase the sequence is CVLS. If X is leucine, the protein is geranylgeranylated. The second motif for prenylation is CXC, which, in the Ras-related protein Rab3A, leads to geranylgeranylation on both cysteine residues and methyl esterification. The third motif, CC, is also found in Rab proteins, where it appears to direct only geranylgeranylation but not carboxyl methylation. Carboxyl methylation only occurs on prenylated proteins.

=== Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I ===
Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I are very similar proteins. They consist of two subunits, the α-subunit, which is common to both enzymes, and the β-subunit, whose sequence identity is just 25%. These enzymes recognise the CaaX box at the C-terminus of the target protein. C is the cysteine that is prenylated, a is any aliphatic amino acid, and the identity of X determines which enzyme acts on the protein. Farnesyltransferase recognizes CaaX boxes where X = M, S, Q, A, or C, whereas geranylgeranyltransferase I recognizes CaaX boxes with X = L or E.

=== Rab geranylgeranyl transferase ===
Rab geranylgeranyltransferase, or geranylgeranyltransferase II, transfers (usually) two geranylgeranyl groups to the cysteine(s) at the C-terminus of Rab proteins. The C-terminus of Rab proteins varies in length and sequence and is referred to as hypervariable. Thus Rab proteins do not have a consensus sequence, such as the CAAX box, which the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase can recognize. The Rab proteins usually terminate in a CC or CXC motif. Instead, Rab proteins are bound by the Rab escort protein (REP) over a more conserved region of the Rab protein and then presented to the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase. Once Rab proteins are prenylated, the lipid anchor(s) ensure that Rabs are no longer soluble. REP, therefore, plays an important role in binding and solubilising the geranylgeranyl groups and delivers the Rab protein to the relevant cell membrane.

=== Substrates ===
Both isoprenoid chains, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) and farnesyl pyrophosphate are products of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. The product of HMG CoA reductase is mevalonate. By combining precursors with 5 carbons, the pathway subsequently produces geranyl pyrophosphate (10 carbons), farnesyl pyrophosphate (15 carbons) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (20 carbons). Two farnesyl pyrophosphate groups can also be combined to form squalene, the precursor for cholesterol. This means that statins, which inhibit HMG CoA reductase, inhibit the production of both cholesterol and isoprenoids.

Note that, in the HMG-CoA reductase/mevalonate pathway, the precursors already contain a pyrophosphate group, and isoprenoids are produced with a pyrophosphate group. There is no known enzyme activity that can carry out the prenylation reaction with the isoprenoid alcohol. However, enzymatic activity for isoprenoid kinases capable converting isoprenoid alcohols to isoprenoid pyrophosphates have been shown. In accordance with this, farnesol and geranylgeraniol have been shown to be able to rescue effects caused by statins or nitrogenous bisphosphonates, further supporting that alcohols &quot;can&quot; be involved in prenylation, likely via phosphorylation to the corresponding isoprenoid pyrophosphate.

Proteins that undergo prenylation include Ras, which plays a central role in the development of cancer. This suggests that inhibitors of prenylation enzymes (e.g., farnesyltransferase) may influence tumor growth. In the case of the K- and N-Ras forms of Ras, when cells are treated with FTIs, these forms of Ras can undergo alternate prenylation in the form of geranylgeranylation. Recent work has shown that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) also inhibit Rab geranylgeranyltransferase and that the success of such inhibitors in clinical trials may be as much due to effects on Rab prenylation as on Ras prenylation. Inhibitors of prenyltransferase enzymes display different specificity for the prenyltransferases, dependent upon the specific compound being utilized.

In addition to GTPases, the protein kinase GRK1 also known as rhodopsin kinase (RK) has been shown to undergo farnesylation and carboxyl methylation directed by the carboxyl terminal CVLS CaaX box sequence of the protein. The functional consequence of these post-translational modifications have been shown to play a role in regulating the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin, a mechanism involved in light adaptation.

=== Inhibitors ===
FTIs can also be used to inhibit farnesylation in parasites such as &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; and malaria. Parasites seem to be more vulnerable to inhibition of farnesyltransferase than humans are. In some cases, this may be because they lack geranylgeranyltransferase I. Thus, it may be possible for the development of antiparasitic drugs to &#x27;piggyback&#x27; on the development of FTIs for cancer research.

In addition, FTIs have shown some promise in treating a mouse model of progeria, and in May 2007 a phase II clinical trial using the FTI lonafarnib was started for children with progeria.

In signal transduction via G protein, palmitoylation of the α subunit, prenylation of the γ subunit, and myristoylation is involved in tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor.

== Prenylation of small molecules ==

Small molecules can also undergo prenylation, such as in the case of prenylflavonoids and other meroterpenoids. Prenylation of a vitamin B2 derivative (flavin mononucleotide) was recently described.

== Longevity and cardiac effects ==
A 2012 study found that statin treatment increases lifespan and improves cardiac health in &quot;Drosophila&quot; by decreasing specific protein prenylation. The study concluded, &quot;These data are the most direct evidence to date that decreased protein prenylation can increase cardiac health and lifespan in any metazoan species, and may explain the pleiotropic (non-cholesterol related) health effects of statins.&quot;

A 2012 clinical trial explored the approach of inhibiting protein prenylation with some degree of success in the treatment of Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome, a multisystem disorder which causes failure to thrive and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to early death.

<text>The Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) is located near Cambridge, UK and is home to a number of the largest and most advanced aperture synthesis radio telescopes in the world, including the One-Mile Telescope, 5-km Ryle Telescope, and the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager. It was founded by the University of Cambridge and is part of the Cambridge University, Cavendish Laboratories, Astrophysics Department.

==History==
Radio interferometry started in the mid-1940s on the outskirts of Cambridge, but with funding from the Science Research Council and a corporate donation of £100,000 from Mullard Limited, a leading commercial manufacturer of thermionic valves.

Construction of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory commenced at Lords Bridge Air Ammunition Park, a few kilometres to the west of Cambridge.

The observatory was founded under Martin Ryle of the Radio-Astronomy Group of the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge and was opened by Sir Edward Victor Appleton on 25 July 1957. This group is now known as the Cavendish Astrophysics Group.

== Location ==
The observatory is located a few miles south-west of Cambridge at Harlton on a former ordnance storage site, next to the disused Oxford-Cambridge Varsity railway line.

A portion of the track bed of the railway, running nearly east-west for several miles, was used to form the main part of the &quot;5km&quot; radio-telescope and the Cambridge Low Frequency Synthesis Telescope. Due to this, the reconstruction of the railway line between Oxford and Cambridge will follow a new alignment at this point.

<text>On the Black Hill is a novel by Bruce Chatwin published in 1982 and winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for that year. In 1987 it was made into a film, directed by Andrew Grieve.

== Plot summary ==

The novel&#x27;s setting is the border of Herefordshire, in England, and Radnorshire, in Wales. In the early pages we are told the border runs through the very farmhouse: 
The border of Radnor and Hereford was said to run right through the middle of the staircase.
The central characters are Welshmen, with the surname Jones.

The story is told through the technique of flashback, and portrays the lives of twin brothers, Lewis and Benjamin Jones, on their isolated upland farm called The Vision. The twins develop a bond that is shown throughout the novel as very special. Lewis is portrayed as the stronger or dominant twin, whereas Benjamin is the more intuitive one, both in appearance and in the tasks which he does around the house. He seems to be constantly drawn to his mother&#x27;s side while she is alive.

Lewis is the one who wants to break free but Benjamin is forced into the army at the time of the Great War. His efforts are frustrated by his family ties and the indefinable, unbreakable tie to the land. Chatwin also tells the reader of the brutality involved in farming at the time in this area. Amos, the father of the two twins, shows how his day-to-day job has brutalised his once caring and loving attitude, and we see this later in the novel when he hits his wife Mary on the temple with the book she is reading – &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. A jealous man, Amos attacks his wife with the very material that shows her intelligence; he feels threatened by this, feeling that the man is supposed to be the head of the family in all things, and he feels anger because of his limited education.

&quot;On the Black Hill&quot; is a novel which portrays themes such as unrequited love, sexual repression and confusion, social, religious and cultural repression, hate and the historic social values of that era, as is shown when Amos finds out that his daughter Rebecca has become pregnant by an Irishman. His religious fanaticism, social pressure, economic forces and an inability to express love results in him throwing her out of the household, and she is not mentioned in the novel again until the latter part. The novel can also be seen as Chatwin&#x27;s autobiografictional utopia, in which each of the twins represents one of the author&#x27;s bisexual subject positions.

== Characters ==
* Sam &#x27;the Wagon&#x27; Jones – the main character&#x27;s paternal grandfather. He lived with the family, enjoys playing the violin.
* Hannah Jones – Sam&#x27;s wife. Hostile to her daughter in law.

She was left living with Amos).
* Amos Jones – Main characters&#x27; father. Marries the local preacher&#x27;s daughter after her father died and rents the farm The Vision, where the majority of the story takes place. Died from being kicked by a horse.

* Mr Arkwright – the local solicitor, he kills his wife with cyanide. He is subsequently hanged for the crime.

== Location ==
The location is lightly fictionalised; The Vision is a real farm north of Llanthony. Many real place names are used, the great majority indicating a site on the border of Herefordshire and Breconshire south of Hay on Wye. The Herefordshire Black Hill and Cefn Hill are outliers of the Black Mountains; Brecknockshire was west of the easternmost ridge of the Black Mountains to the west. Hay-on-Wye (with its castle and pre-war railway station) would be the principal town in the area but its name is notable by its absence; instead, it seems the name of the Radnorshire hamlet of Rhulen has been used. The name of the Shropshire location of Lurkenhope has been used for the principal village. Talgarth, although not mentioned in the film, is another small nearby town, which would have been of greater importance to the area at the time.

On the Ordnance Survey map, &#x27;Abergavenny and the Black Mountains, Wales sheet 161&#x27; (1:50,000 series) and even better depicted on the more detailed 1:25,000 series at the Black Hill itself is shown, towards Craswall. The name refers to a well known ridge descending very steeply from the very long Hatterall Ridge (which forms the England / Wales border) and carries Offas Dyke footpath on it, down into the fields of Herefordshire, and on the English side. The Black Hill is known locally as &#x27;The Cat&#x27;s Back&#x27; as viewed from Herefordshire it looks like a crouching cat about to pounce. On the same map at , just a little to the south, is the real farm called The Vision, situated in the Llanthony valley, also known as the Vale of Ewyas, on the Welsh side of the border, just below Capel-y-ffin.

Alternatively, the location that inspired the novel could be the Black Hill between Knighton and Clun and a few miles from Lurkenhope. Chatwin stayed nearby in Cwm Hall, Purslow with friends during the 1970s and was confidently cited as such in a BBC programme by his biographer.

Chatwin amalgamated reality with his research amongst the local indigenous populace in the time he researched the book, interweaving fact and fiction, gossip, locations, stories and social history.

Much of the book was written at Scethrog Tower, between Brecon and Crickhowell. The tower was home to George Melly whose wife, Diana, was a close friend of Chatwin&#x27;s and was a dedicatee for the book.

== Prizes ==
The book was awarded the 1982 James Tait Black Memorial Prize and Whitbread First Novel of the Year Award (which raises a question over the status of the earlier book &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot;).

== Adaptation ==
&quot;On the Black Hill&quot; was adapted for the stage in 1986 and into a film in 1987.

<doc id="1064386" wikidata="Q7853348" url="?curid=1064386" title="Tunnock's">
<text>Thomas Tunnock Limited, commonly known as Tunnock&#x27;s, is a Scottish confectionery company based in Uddingston, Scotland. It is headed by Boyd Tunnock, grandson of Thomas. In 2013, a joint report by Family Business United and Close Brothers Asset Management named it the 20th oldest family firm in Scotland.

For two seasons, 2019 and 2020, Tunnock&#x27;s sponsored the Scottish Challenge Cup in Scottish football.

==History==
Tunnock&#x27;s was formed by Thomas Tunnock (b. 1865) as Tunnock&#x27;s in 1890, when he purchased a baker&#x27;s shop in Lorne Place, Uddingston. The company expanded in the 1950s, and it was at this time that the core products were introduced to the lines, when sugar and fat rationing meant that products with longer shelf-lives than cakes had to be produced.

Since 2005, Tunnock&#x27;s has sponsored the Tour of Mull, an annual car rally held on the Isle of Mull.

In September 2010, Tunnock&#x27;s workers in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, conducted two 24-hour strikes during contract negotiations. At main issue were salaries, with management having originally offered an increase of 1%, followed by a second offer of 2%. The dispute was resolved in October 2010 with agreement on a 2.5% increase backdated to the start of July 2010, followed by a 2.5% increase in July 2011.

In November 2015, Tunnock&#x27;s made a donation of £250,000 to an appeal for an independent lifeboat station at St Abbs.

===Scottish identity===
Tunnocks has been described as an iconic Scottish brand and its packaging features the Scottish lion rampant. Having been a Scottish, family owned company since it was formed, this remains a feature of its identity.

In an April 2012 interview with &quot;The Herald&quot;, Managing Director Boyd Tunnock described himself as &quot;Nationalist British&quot; on the question of Scottish independence.

In the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in Glasgow, dancers dressed as Tunnock&#x27;s teacakes danced around the main performers near the start of the Scottish-themed show. Sales of Tunnock&#x27;s tea cakes were 62% higher at Waitrose the day after the ceremony.

In 2016 this association with Scottish identity raised concerns about the company playing down its origins, when an advertising campaign on London Underground chose to omit the Lion Rampant and label their teacakes as &quot;Tunnock’s Great British Teacake&quot;. Boyd Tunnock explained &quot;Down south, people wouldn’t know it as Scottish.&quot; 

In July 2017 Tunnock&#x27;s announced it would be branding their wafer creams sold in Japan, as &quot;Made in Great Britain&quot;. The company, however, did not have high hopes of success in the Japanese market. &quot;The Japanese don’t like caramel wafers. It’s a cultural thing - they say they are too chewy.&quot;

== Teacakes ==

The Tunnock&#x27;s Teacake is a sweet food often served with a cup of tea or coffee. It was developed by Sir Boyd Tunnock in 1956. The product consists of a small round shortbread biscuit covered with a dome of Italian meringue, a whipped egg white concoction similar to marshmallow, although somewhat lighter in texture. This is then encased in a thin layer of milk or dark chocolate and wrapped in a red and silver foil paper for the more popular milk chocolate variety, with blue, black, and gold wrapping for the dark.

Retired RAF bomber pilot Tony Cunnane told of how Tunnock&#x27;s Teacakes became a favourite ration snack of the V bomber nuclear deterrent flight crews based at RAF Gaydon, especially after discovering that they expanded at high altitude. This ended after one was left unwrapped and exploded on the instrument panel.

== Caramel wafers ==

The Tunnock&#x27;s Caramel Wafer, officially the Tunnock&#x27;s Milk Chocolate Coated Caramel Wafer Biscuit, is a bar consisting of five layers of wafer, separated by four layers of caramel. The bar is coated in chocolate, made from cocoa and milk solids. The wafers are wrapped in red and gold coloured foil. Dark chocolate wafers, wrapped blue and gold, are also available.

The University of St Andrews had a Tunnock&#x27;s Caramel Wafer Appreciation Society, founded in 1982, disbanded in 2016.

In 2022, Tunnock&#x27;s were the pitch sponsor at Uddingston Rugby Club, turning their padded posts into wrapped Caramel Wafer bars.

== Other products ==
The other products in Tunnock&#x27;s lines are largely based on the core products. The &quot;Caramel Log&quot; is similar to the Caramel Wafer, but with the addition of roasted coconut to the outside of the bar. &quot;Wafer Creams&quot; and &quot;Florida Orange&quot; have chocolate and orange flavoured cream in place of the caramel.

A &quot;Snowball&quot; is similar to the Tea Cake, with the addition of grated coconut to the exterior of a soft chocolate shell but with no biscuit base.

Despite pressure to do so, Tunnock&#x27;s does not make any own brand biscuits for supermarkets.

In 2013, Tunnocks&#x27;s entered into an agreement with Tesco to sell a range of branded items produced by Glasgow-based promotional materials firm Orb. Fergus Loudon, sales manager for Tunnock&#x27;s stated: &quot;As well as teacake tea towels, aprons and china mugs, there will be the ideal gift for the many caramel wafer fans – a ‘yard of caramel wafers’.&quot; As of 2015, the products continue to be sold both through Tesco and directly from Orb.

<text>The Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was an Asian football club competition contested annually by the winners of domestic cup competitions. The cup was, chronologically, the second seasonal inter-Asian club competition organised by Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The tournament was started in 1990–91 and ran for 12 seasons, with the final edition held in 2001–02, after which it was discontinued and merged into the Asian Club Championship to form the AFC Champions League.

The winners of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup used to contest the Asian Super Cup against the winners of the Asian Club Championship.

The most successful clubs in the competition were Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia and Yokohama F. Marinos from Japan with two titles each.

==History==
The competition was founded at the beginning of 1990 by the Asian Football Confederation, following the example of UEFA in Europe, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. For the first edition, seventeen teams took part registered and it was the Iranian club of Persepolis who were the first winners, after defeating the Bahraini Al-Muharraq in the final. Al-Hilal won the last championship in 2001–02, defeating Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. In 2002, Asian Club Championship, Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and Asian Super Cup tournaments combined to form the AFC Champions League and after that, the domestic cup winners entered the AFC Champions League.

<text>Carter Godwin Woodson (December 19, 1875April 3, 1950) was an American historian, author, journalist, and the founder of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH). He was one of the first scholars to study the history of the African diaspora, including African-American history. A founder of &quot;The Journal of Negro History&quot; in 1916, Woodson has been called the &quot;father of black history.&quot; In February 1926, he launched the celebration of &quot;Negro History Week,&quot; the precursor of Black History Month. Woodson was an important figure to the movement of Afrocentrism, due to his perspective of placing people of African descent at the center of the study of history and the human experience.

Born in Virginia, the son of former slaves, Woodson had to put off schooling while he worked in the coal mines of West Virginia. He graduated from Berea College, and became a teacher and school administrator. Earning graduate degrees at the University of Chicago, Woodson then became the second African American, after W. E. B. Du Bois, to obtain a PhD degree from Harvard University. Woodson is the only person whose parents were enslaved in the United States to obtain a PhD in history. Largely excluded from the uniformly-white academic history profession, Woodson realized the need to make the structures which support scholarship in black history, and black historians. He taught at historically black colleges, Howard University and West Virginia State University, but spent most of his career in Washington, D.C., managing the ASALH, public speaking, writing, and publishing.
==Early life and education==
Carter G. Woodson was born in New Canton, Virginia, on December 19, 1875, the son of former slaves Anne Eliza (Riddle) and James Henry Woodson. Although his father was illiterate, Carter&#x27;s mother, Anna, had been taught to read by her mistress. His father, James, during the Civil War, had helped Union soldiers near Richmond, after escaping from his owner, by leading them to Confederate supply stations and warehouses to raid army supplies. Thereafter, and until the war ended, James had scouted for the Union Army. In 1867, Anna and James married, and later moved to West Virginia after buying a small farm. The Woodson family was extremely poor, but proud. Both Woodson&#x27;s parents told him that it was the happiest day of their lives when they became free. His sister was the poet, teacher, and activist Bessie Woodson Yancey. Woodson was often unable to attend primary school regularly so as to help out on the farm. Through a mixture of self-instruction and four months of instruction from his two uncles, brothers of his mother who were also taught to read, Woodson was able to master most school subjects.

At the age of seventeen, Woodson followed his older brother Robert Henry to Huntington, West Virginia, where he hoped to attend Douglass High School, a secondary school for African Americans founded there. Woodson worked in the coal mines near the New River in southern West Virginia, which left little time for pursuing an education. At the age of twenty in 1895, Woodson was finally able to enter Douglass High School full-time and received his diploma in 1897. From his graduation in 1897 until 1900, Woodson was employed as a teacher at a school in Winona, West Virginia. His career advanced further in 1900 when he became the principal of Douglass High School, the place where he had started his academic career. Between 1901 and 1903, Woodson took classes at Berea College in Kentucky, eventually earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature in 1903. From 1903 to 1907, Woodson served as a school supervisor in the Philippines, which had recently become an American territory.

Woodson later attended the University of Chicago, where he was awarded an A.B and A.M in 1908. He was a member of the first Black professional fraternity Sigma Pi Phi and a member of Omega Psi Phi. Woodson&#x27;s M.A thesis was titled &quot;The German Policy of France in the War of Austrian Succession.&quot; He completed his PhD in history at Harvard University in 1912, where he was the second African American (after W. E. B. Du Bois) to earn a doctorate. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Disruption of Virginia&quot;, was based on research he did at the Library of Congress while teaching high school in Washington, D.C. During his research, Woodson came into conflict with his supervisors, causing professor of history, Frederick Jackson Turner, to intervene on Woodson&#x27;s behalf. Woodson&#x27;s dissertation advisor was Albert Bushnell Hart, who had also been the advisor for Du Bois, with Edward Channing and Charles Haskins also on the committee.

After earning his doctoral degree, he continued teaching in public schools–no university was willing to hire him–ultimately becoming the principal of the all-Black Armstrong Manual Training School in Washington D.C. He later joined the faculty at Howard University as a professor, and served there as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

Woodson felt that the American Historical Association (AHA) had no interest in Black history, noting that although he was a dues-paying member of the AHA, he was not allowed to attend AHA conferences. Woodson became convinced he had no future in the white-dominated historical profession, and to work as a Black historian would require creating an institutional structure that would make it possible for Black scholars to study history. Because Woodson lacked the funds to finance such a new institutional structure himself, he turned to philanthropist institutions such as the Carnegie Foundation, the Julius Rosenwald Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.

==Career==
Convinced that the role of his own people in American history and in the history of other cultures was being ignored or misrepresented among scholars, Woodson realized the need for research into the neglected past of African Americans. Along with William D. Hartgrove, George Cleveland Hall, Alexander L. Jackson, and James E. Stamps, he founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASLNH) on September 9, 1915, in Chicago. Woodson&#x27;s purpose was &quot;to treat the records scientifically and to publish the findings of the world&quot; in order to avoid &quot;the awful fate of becoming a negligible factor in the thought of the world.&quot; His stays at the Wabash Avenue YMCA in Chicago and in the surrounding Bronzeville neighborhood, including 1915&#x27;s Lincoln Jubilee, inspired him to create the ASLNH (now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History). Another inspiration was John Wesley Cromwell&#x27;s 1914 book, &quot;The Negro in American History: Men and Women Eminent in the Evolution of the American of African Descent&quot;.

Woodson believed that education and increasing social and professional contacts among Black and white people could reduce racism, and he promoted the organized study of African-American history partly for that purpose. He would later promote the first Negro History Week in Washington, D.C., in 1926, forerunner of Black History Month. The Association ran conferences, published &quot;The Journal of Negro History&quot;, and &quot;particularly targeted those responsible for the education of black children.&quot;

In January 1916, Woodson began publication of the scholarly &quot;Journal of Negro History&quot;. It has never missed an issue, despite the Great Depression, loss of support from foundations, and two World Wars. In 2002, it was renamed the &quot;Journal of African American History&quot; and continues to be published by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH). Woodson published &quot;The Education of the Negro Prior to 1861&quot;. His other books followed: &quot;A Century of Negro Migration&quot; (1918) and &quot;The History of the Negro Church&quot; (1927). His work &quot;The Negro in Our History&quot; has been reprinted in numerous editions and was revised by Charles H. Wesley after Woodson&#x27;s death in 1950. Woodson described the purpose of the ASNLH as the &quot;scientific study&quot; of the &quot;neglected aspects of Negro life and history&quot; by training a new generation of Black people in historical research and methodology. Believing that history belonged to everybody, not just the historians, Woodson sought to engage Black civic leaders, high school teachers, clergymen, women&#x27;s groups and fraternal associations in his project to improve the understanding of African-American history.

He served as Academic Dean of the West Virginia Collegiate Institute, now West Virginia State University, from 1920 to 1922. By 1922, Woodson&#x27;s experience of academic politics and intrigue had left him so disenchanted with university life that he vowed never to work in academia again. He continued to write publish and lecture nationwide. He studied many aspects of African-American history. For instance, in 1924, he published the first study of free Black slave owners of 1830, in the United States .

==NAACP==
Woodson became affiliated with the Washington, D.C., branch of the NAACP and its chairman Archibald Grimké. On January 28, 1915, Woodson wrote a letter to Grimké expressing his dissatisfaction with activities and making two proposals:
# That the branch secure an office for a center to which persons may report whatever concerns the Black race may have, and from which the Association may extend its operations into every part of the city; and
# That a canvasser be appointed to enlist members and obtain subscriptions for &quot;The Crisis&quot;, the NAACP magazine edited by W. E. B. Du Bois.

Du Bois added the proposal to divert &quot;patronage from business establishments which do not treat races alike;&quot; that is, boycott racially discriminatory businesses. Woodson wrote that he would cooperate as one of the twenty-five effective canvassers, adding that he would pay the office rent for one month. Grimké did not welcome Woodson&#x27;s ideas.

Responding to Grimké&#x27;s comments about his proposals, on March 18, 1915, Woodson wrote:

I am not afraid of being sued by white businessmen. In fact, I should welcome such a law suit. It would do the cause much good. Let us banish fear. We have been in this mental state for three centuries. I am a radical. I am ready to act, if I can find brave men to help me.

His difference of opinion with Grimké, who wanted a more conservative course, contributed to Woodson&#x27;s ending his affiliation with the NAACP.

==Black History Month==
Woodson devoted the rest of his life to historical research. He worked to preserve the history of African Americans and accumulated a collection of thousands of artifacts and publications. He noted that African-American contributions &quot;were overlooked, ignored, and even suppressed by the writers of history textbooks and the teachers who use them.&quot; Race prejudice, he concluded, &quot;is merely the logical result of tradition, the inevitable outcome of thorough instruction to the effect that the Negro has never contributed anything to the progress of mankind.&quot;

The summer of 1919 was the &quot;Red Summer,&quot; a time of intense racial violence that saw about 1,000 people killed between May and September. Most of them were Black. In the face of widespread disillusionment felt in Black America caused by the &quot;Red Summer&quot;, Carter worked hard to improve the understanding of Black history, later writing: &quot;I have made every sacrifice for this movement. I have spent all my time doing this one thing and trying to do it efficiently.&quot; The 1920s were a time of rising Black self-consciousness expressed variously in movements such as the Harlem Renaissance and the Universal Negro Improvement Association led by an extremely charismatic Jamaican immigrant Marcus Garvey. In this atmosphere, Woodson was considered by other Black Americans to be one of their most important community leaders who discovered their &quot;lost history.&quot; Woodson&#x27;s project for the &quot;New Negro History&quot; had a dual purpose of giving Black Americans a history to be proud of and to ensure that the overlooked role of Black people in American history was acknowledged by white historians. Woodson wanted a history that would ensure that &quot;the world see the Negro as a participant rather than as a lay figure in history.&quot;

He wrote: &quot;[W]hile the Association welcomes the cooperation of white scholars in certain projects...it proceeds also on the basis that its important objectives can be attained through Negro investigators who are in a position to develop certain aspects of the life and history of the race which cannot otherwise be treated. In the final analysis, this work must be done by Negroes... The point here is rather that Negroes have the advantage of being able to think black.&quot; Woodson&#x27;s claim that only Black historians could really understand Black history anticipated the fierce debates that rocked the American historical profession in the 1960s–1970s when a younger generation of Black historians asserted that only Black people were qualified to write about Black history. Despite these claims, the need for funding ensured that Woodson had several white philanthropists such as Julius Rosenwald, George Foster Peabody, and James H. Dillard elected to the board of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Woodson preferred white patrons such as Rosenwald who were willing to finance his Association without being involved in its work. Some of the white board members that Woodson recruited such as historian Albert Bushnell Hart and teacher Thomas Jesse Jones were not content to play the passive role that Woodson wanted, leading to clashes as both Hart and Jones wanted to write about Black history. In 1920, both Jones and Hart resigned from the Board in protest against Woodson.

In 1926, Woodson pioneered the celebration of &quot;Negro History Week,&quot; designated for the second week in February, to coincide with marking the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Woodson wrote of the purpose of Negro History Week as: It is not so much a Negro History Week as it is a History Week. We should emphasise not Negro History, but the Negro in History. What we need is not a history of selected races or nations, but the history of the world void of national bias, race hatred and religious prejudice. The idea of a Negro History Week was a popular one, and to honor Negro History Week parades, breakfasts, speeches, lectures, poetry readings, banquets, and exhibits were commonly held. The Black United Students and Black educators at Kent State University expanded this idea to include an entire month beginning on February 1, 1970. Since 1976, every US president has designated February as Black History Month.

==Colleagues==
Woodson believed in self-reliance and racial respect, values he shared with Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican activist who worked in New York. Woodson became a regular columnist for Garvey&#x27;s weekly &quot;Negro World&quot;. Garvey believed Afro-Americans should embrace segregation, as he contended that race relations were and always would be antagonistic, and his ultimate objective was a &quot;Back-to-Africa&quot; plan as he believed all Afro-Americans should move to Africa. Woodson broke with Garvey when he learned that Garvey was meeting with the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan to discuss how the Universal Negro Improvement Association and the Klan could work together to achieve his &quot;Back-to-Africa&quot; plans.

Woodson&#x27;s political activism placed him at the center of a circle of many Black intellectuals and activists from the 1920s to the 1940s. He corresponded with W. E. B. Du Bois, John E. Bruce, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, Hubert H. Harrison, and T. Thomas Fortune, among others. Even with the extended duties of the Association, Woodson was able to write academic works such as &quot;The History of the Negro Church&quot; (1922), &quot;The Mis-Education of the Negro&quot; (1933), and others which continue to have wide readership.

Woodson did not shy away from controversial subjects, and used the pages of &quot;Black World&quot; to contribute to debates. One issue related to West Indian/African-American relations. He summarized that &quot;the West Indian Negro is free,&quot; and observed that West Indian societies had been more successful at properly dedicating the necessary amounts of time and resources needed to educate and emancipate people genuinely. Woodson approved of efforts by West Indians to include materials related to Black history and culture into their school curricula. 

Woodson was ostracized by some of his contemporaries because of his insistence on defining a category of history related to ethnic culture and race. At the time, these educators felt that it was wrong to teach or understand African-American history as separate from more general American history. According to these educators, &quot;Negroes&quot; were simply Americans, darker skinned, but with no history apart from that of any other. Thus Woodson&#x27;s efforts to get Black culture and history into the curricula of institutions, even historically Black colleges, were often unsuccessful. 

==Criticism of Christian churches==
Woodson criticized Christian churches for offering limited opportunity and requiring segregation. In 1933, he wrote in &quot;The Mis-Education of the Negro&quot; that “the ritualistic churches into which these Negroes have gone do not touch the masses, and they show no promising future for racial development. Such institutions are controlled by those who offer the Negroes only limited opportunity and then sometimes on the condition that they be segregated in the court of the gentiles outside of the temple of Jehovah.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Woodson died suddenly from a heart attack in the office within his home in the Shaw, Washington, D.C., neighborhood on April 3, 1950, at the age of 74. He is buried at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland.

The time that schools have set aside each year to focus on African-American history is Woodson&#x27;s most visible legacy. His determination to further the recognition of the Black race in American and world history, however, inspired countless other scholars. Woodson remained focused on his work throughout his life. Many see him as a man of vision and understanding. Although Woodson was among the ranks of the educated few, he did not feel particularly sentimental about elite educational institutions. The Association and journal that he started are still operating, and both have earned intellectual respect.

Woodson&#x27;s other far-reaching activities included the founding in 1920 of The Associated Publishers in Washington, D.C. This enabled the publication of books concerning Black people that might not have been supported in the rest of the market. He founded Negro History Week in 1926 (now known as Black History Month). He created the &quot;Negro History Bulletin&quot;, developed for teachers in elementary and high school grades, and published continuously since 1937. Woodson also influenced the Association&#x27;s direction and subsidizing of research in African-American history. He wrote numerous articles, monographs, and books on Black people. &quot;The Negro in Our History&quot; reached its 11th edition in 1966, when it had sold more than 90,000 copies.

Dorothy Porter Wesley recalled: &quot;Woodson would wrap up his publications, take them to the post office and have dinner at the YMCA. He would teasingly decline her dinner invitations saying, &#x27;No, you are trying to marry me off. I am married to my work.&#x27;&quot; Woodson&#x27;s most cherished ambition, a six-volume &quot;Encyclopedia Africana&quot;, was incomplete at the time of his death.

In 1998, musician and ethnomusicologist Craig Woodson (once of the experimental rock band The United States of America), arranged a ceremony to apologize for his white ancestors&#x27; involvement in the slavery that had oppressed members of Carter G. Woodson&#x27;s family. Following the reconciliation, both sides of the family developed the Black White Families Reconciliation (BWFR) Protocol, using the creative arts, particularly drumming and storytelling, with the aim of healing racial divides within Black and white families who share a surname.

<doc id="1064398" wikidata="Q775787" url="?curid=1064398" title="Arpoador">
<text>Arpoador (literally, &quot;the harpoon thrower&quot;) is a region located on the southern zone of the city Rio de Janeiro, in a small peninsula between Ipanema and Copacabana. Part of its territory belongs to the neighbourhood of Ipanema, and part to Copacabana.

==Surfing==
Arpoador is considered one of the best metropolitan surf spots in Rio de Janeiro. The rock outcropping creates stable left breakers up to 7–10 feet high.

Given its metropolitan location, crowds are ferocious and competitive. Given the fact that waves start to break against the rock on a good day, and that a strong rip tide along the promontory creates a quick re-entry, the take-off point is very small.

==Sunset==
During some time around midsummer it is possible to see the Sun setting over the sea from Arpoador, a rare event on the generally eastward-facing Brazilian coast. On these occasions crowds gather around the place and cheer when the Sun disappears.

==Walking==
Arpoador is a very popular place for tourists and locals to walk. Arpoador lies at the end of a 4km walk from Leblon, with a number of cafes located there to allow people to stop to look at the sea or enjoy the sun. The rock itself is open to the public, with a number of walkways in place to make it easier to scale the rocks.

<text>Zbraslav (; ; Latin &quot;Aula Regia&quot;) is a municipal district and cadastral area of Prague. The southernmost district of Prague, it lies on the Vltava River in the national administrative district of Prague 16.

The former independent municipality of Zbraslav is now one of two cadastral areas in the Prague-Zbraslav Municipal District. The other is Lahovice.

==History==

Zbraslav was founded in 1118. In the 13th century, the king Wenceslaus II of Bohemia founded here a very influential Cistercian abbey which was called &quot;Aula regia&quot; in Latin. The medieval monastery became the burial place of Bohemian kings. The Madonna of Zbraslav (a masterpiece of Bohemian Gothic fine art) was painted for this monastery in the 1340s.

In 1935, V. Bulgakov founded an important Russian museum here with collections dedicated to Russian emigrants, but the museum was closed and confiscated by the Communists before 1948.

In 1924, Žabovřesky and Záběhlice were joined to Zbraslav. In 1967, Zbraslav was promoted to a town. Zbraslav was merged into the city of Prague in 1974. It used to house the Chinese and Japanese collections of the National Gallery in Prague in the building of former monastery.

==Demographics==
==Notable people==
*Petr Žitavský (1270–1339), abbot of the Zbraslav Monastery, politician and author of the &quot;Zbraslav Chronicle&quot;
*Vladislav Vančura (1891–1942), novelist; lived here from 1921
*Jaromír Vejvoda (1902–1988), songwriter; his home is now a restaurant called Škoda Lásky with paraphernalia relating to him

<text>Hypercolor was a line of clothing, mainly T-shirts and shorts, that changed color with heat.

They were manufactured by Generra Sportswear Company of Seattle and marketed in the United States as Generra Hypercolor or Generra Hypergrafix and elsewhere as Global Hypercolor. They contained a thermochromic pigment made by Matsui Shikiso Chemical of Japan, that changed between two colors—one when cold, one when warm. The shirts were produced with several color change choices beginning in 1991. The effect could easily be permanently damaged, particularly when the clothing was washed in hotter than recommended water, ironed, bleached, or tumble-dried.

Generra Sportswear Co. had originally been founded as a men&#x27;s sportswear distributor and importer in Seattle in 1980. The company was sold to Texas-based Farah Manufacturing Co. in 1984 and bought back by its founders in 1989. In 1986, the company added childrenswear and womenswear items to their portfolio. They struggled to meet the overwhelming demand for Hypercolor products. Between February and May 1991 they sold $50 million in Hypercolor garments. Generra went bankrupt due to mismanagement and fading demand in 1992. The Hypercolor business for the U.S. market was sold to The Seattle T-shirt Company in 1993; Generra kept the rights for the international market. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 1995 as a licensing business. The Generra name was acquired by Public Clothing Co. of New York in 2002. Today, Generra Co. is a contemporary women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s apparel brand headquartered in New York City.

In the early 2000s, the technique was revived by a number of apparel brands. In mid-2020, the color-changing clothing trend was revived yet again by several online retailers selling color-changing swim trunks.

==Principle==
Substances that can change color due to a change in temperature are called thermochromes. There are two common types of thermochromes: liquid crystals (used in mood rings) and leuco dyes (used in Hypercolor T-shirts).

The color change of Hypercolor shirts is based on combination of two colors: the color of the dyed fabric, which remained constant, and the color of the thermochromic dye. Droplets of the thermochromic dye mixture are enclosed in transparent microcapsules, a few micrometers in diameter, bound to the fibers of the fabric.

The thermochromic droplets are actually a mixture of several chemicals—crystal violet lactone (the color-changing dye itself), benzotriazole (a weak acid), and a quaternary ammonium salt of a fatty acid (myristylammonium oleate) dissolved in 1-dodecanol as solvent. Together, these lead to a reversible chemical reaction in response to temperature change that produces a change of color.

At low temperatures, the mixture is a solid. The weak acid forms a colored complex with the leuco dye by causing the lactone ring in the center of the dye molecule to open. At high temperatures, above , the solvent melts and the ammonium salt dissociates, allowing it to react with the weak acid. This reaction increases the pH, which leads to closing of the lactone ring of the dye to convert it to its colorless (leuco) form.

Therefore, at the low temperature the color of the shirt is the combination of the color of the encapsulated colored dye with the color of the dyed fabric, while at higher temperatures the capsules become colorless and the color of the fabric prevails.

<text>Ipanema () is a neighbourhood located in the South Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between Leblon and Arpoador. The beach at Ipanema became known internationally with the popularity of the bossa nova song, &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; (&quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot;), written by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes. It borders the neighborhoods of Copacabana, Leblon and Lagoa.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Ipanema&quot; originally referred to a river in the state of São Paulo, its etymology deriving from the Tupi language words &quot;ipá&quot; (pond) and &quot;nem-a&quot; (stinking). Possible translations for its original meaning are &quot;worthless water&quot;, &quot;stinking lake&quot;, &quot;turbid water&quot;, or &quot;water worthless for human consumption&quot;. The historian Teodoro Sampaio translated &quot;Ipanema&quot; as &quot;bad water&quot;.

The neighbourhood in Rio de Janeiro was named after José Antonio Moreira Filho, the Baron of Ipanema, who in 1883 created the first urban settlement in the region.

The border area between Copacabana and Ipanema is known locally as &quot;Copanema&quot;.

==History==
Ipanema today consists mostly of land that once belonged to José Antonio Moreira Filho, Baron of Ipanema. The name &quot;Ipanema&quot; did not refer originally to the beach, but to the homeland of the baron at São Paulo.

== Character ==

Ipanema is adjacent to Copacabana and Leblon beaches, but it is distinct from its neighbours. It is relatively easy to navigate because the streets are aligned in a grid. Ipanema&#x27;s beach culture includes surfers and sunbathers who gather daily at the beach. Every Sunday, the roadway closest to the beach is closed to motor vehicles allowing local residents and tourists to ride bikes, roller skate, skateboard, and walk along the ocean. Ipanema is one of Rio&#x27;s most expensive districts to live in; private investment has led to the building of world-class restaurants, shops, and cafés.

Ipanema has played a cultural role in Rio de Janeiro since the city&#x27;s beginning, with its own universities, art galleries, and theatres. It holds a street parade, the Banda de Ipanema, during Carnival festivities separate from those of Rio de Janeiro, attracting up to 50,000 people to the streets of Ipanema.

== Beach ==

The beach at Ipanema is known for its elegant development and its social life. Two mountains called the &quot;Dois Irmãos&quot; (Two Brothers) rise at the western end of the beach, which is divided into segments delineated by &quot;postos&quot;, or lifeguard towers. Beer is sold everywhere, along with the traditional &quot;cachaça&quot;. There are always circles of people playing football, volleyball, and footvolley, a locally invented sport that is a combination of volleyball and football.

In the winter the surf can reach three metres (nine feet). The water quality varies from clear light-blue water to a more murky green after heavy rains. Constant swells help keep the water clean, and the often treacherous beach break regularly forms surfable barrels. Just west of this colourful section, towards Leblon, Rio de Janeiro, is another popular stretch of sand known as Posto 10, referring to the #10 lifeguard station.

The beach is one of many areas that suffers from the city&#x27;s poor waste treatment. In its waters, &quot;fecal coliform bacteria sometimes spike at 16 times the Brazilian government&#x27;s &#x27;satisfactory&#x27; level.&quot; Large amounts of pollutants are still dumped into the sea through the nearby marine outfall pipe, a matter of increasing concern to ecologists.

Beachgoers often applaud the sunset in the summer. In 2008, the Travel Channel listed Ipanema Beach as the sexiest beach in the world.

==Posto 9==
Posto 9 is the section of the beach around the #9 lifeguard station, across from Joana Angelica Street. Its notoriety began around 1979 when Fernando Gabeira, later a federal deputy for the State of Rio de Janeiro, returned from political exile in France and was photographed there in a thong. He had been a member of the leftist urban guerrilla group MR8, which kidnapped the American ambassador, Charles Burke Elbrick, in 1969 and demanded the release of fifteen political prisoners in exchange for his life.

Gabeira became a political celebrity with the publication of a memoir about his experiences as a guerrilla and his years in exile. In 1979, he was photographed wearing a skimpy purple swimsuit at Ipanema, and gave an interview to a gay and lesbian newspaper, inciting rumours that he was gay, which he neither confirmed nor denied. His going to the beach at Posto 9 made it famous throughout the country.

Posto 9 inherited its status as a gathering spot for counter-cultural types from the area near Farme de Amoedo Street, next to the dunes called &quot;Dunas do Barato&quot; and a pier that was demolished in the 1970s. It has a long history of public cannabis smoking (illegal in Brazil), police raids, and gatherings of left-wing intellectuals. It is still popular with students, artists, actors, and liberal-minded people.

==Feira Hippie de Ipanema==
A group of hippies started a Sunday market in Ipanema in 1968 and the traditional fair continues with over 700 stalls set up at the Feira Hippie de Ipanema (Ipanema Hippie Market).

==Cultural references==
Ipanema gained fame with the rise of the popular bossa nova sound, when residents Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes created their ode to the neighbourhood, &quot;The Girl from Ipanema.&quot; The song was written in 1962, with music by Jobim and Portuguese lyrics by de Moraes; English lyrics were written later by Norman Gimbel.

<text>The Asian Super Cup was an annual football competition between the winners of the Asian Club Championship and the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

The competition started in 1995, but came to an end in 2002 after both major AFC tournaments were merged into the AFC Champions League. The most successful clubs in the competition are Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia and Suwon Samsung Bluewings of South Korea.

==History==
The Asian Super Cup started and organized in 1995 by the AFC, it was played in two legs. The Asian Super cup pitted the winner of the Asian Club Championship against the winner of the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In 2002, the Asian Club Championship and the Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup merged to form the AFC Champions League, as a result, the Asian Super Cup was discontinued.

<text>N.Y.P.D. is a half-hour long American police crime drama set in the context of the New York City Police Department. The program aired on the ABC network from 1967–1969 in the 9:30 p.m. night time slot. During the second season, &quot;N.Y.P.D&quot; was joined by &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; and &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; to form a 2½ hour block of crime dramas.

==Plot==
&quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot; centers around three New York police detectives – Lieutenant Mike Haines (Jack Warden), Detective Jeff Ward (Robert Hooks), and Detective Johnny Corso (Frank Converse) – who fight a wide range of crimes and criminals. The show features many real New York City locations, as well as episodes based on actual New York City police cases.

==Cast==
* Jack Warden as Lt. Mike Haines
* Robert Hooks as Det. Jeff Ward
* Frank Converse as Det. Johnny Corso
* Ted Beniades as Det. Richie
* Denise Nicholas as Ethel
* Tom Rosqui as Det. Jacobs

==Production==
===Development===
The show was produced by Talent Associates, Ltd., a company founded by Alfred Levy and David Susskind. Talent Associates had produced 14 years of the anthology program &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Kaiser Aluminum Hour&quot;. David Susskind created &quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot; with screenwriter Arnold Perl (&quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot;). Daniel Melnick, executive producer of &quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot;, was a partner with Susskind in Talent Associates and had brought Mel Brooks and Buck Henry together to create the television comedy &quot;Get Smart&quot; in 1965. Producer Susskind and actor Harvey Keitel would work together again on Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974). One of the writers on the series was Lonne Elder, who would later become the first African-American nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar (for the 1972 movie &quot;Sounder&quot;).

===Casting===
Among the guest stars who appeared in the series were: 
* Al Pacino (S02E05; &quot;Deadly Circle of Violence&quot;)
* Martin Sheen (S02E08 &quot;The Peep Freak&quot;)
* Jon Voight (S01E14; &quot;The Bombers&quot;)
* Harvey Keitel (S02E06; &quot;The Shady Lady&quot;)
* Jane Alexander (S02E14; &quot;The Night Watch&quot;)

===Writing===
In 1967, &quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot; was the first television series in America to air an episode with a self-identified gay character (&quot;Shakedown&quot;). The plot of the episode centers around the police tracking down a blackmailer who has triggered several suicides by their targeting of gay men. In the course of their investigation, the police also visit a gay rights group, another first.

&quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot; scripts featured both black and white people as cops, suspects, and witnesses, an unselfconscious racial blend that would not otherwise be seen for several years on American network television (&quot;Room 222&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; were among the next series to feature casts situated similarly.)

===Opening credits===
The series&#x27; opening credit sequence, prominently featuring a closeup of a police car emergency light as the vehicle drives through the streets of New York, would later be spoofed in the 1980s comedy series &quot;Police Squad!&quot; and subsequent movies.

<text>Hilleberg the Tentmaker is a Swedish tent-making company that was founded in 1971 by a husband and wife team, Bo and Renate Hilleberg. The company manufactures almost 40 different tent models of various designs and sizes, though production is focused on specialist lightweight tents at the premium end of the market. Their products have a reputation for excellent quality, durability, and design. In 2016, the founders’ daughter, Petra Hilleberg, took over as CEO of the Hilleberg Group.

In 1973, the company introduced the Keb, a double-wall tent where the inner tent and outer tent (or fly) were connected and so pitched simultaneously. In 1975, Hilleberg was the first company to use silicone-coated fabrics, rather than polyurethane coated ones, for their outer tents. Their flagship tent is the Keron tunnel tent, and other well-known tents are the Nammatj single vestibule tent, the Anjan lightweight tent, the Allak freestanding dome tent and the Akto single pole solo tunnel tent. Hilleberg tents are often used for exploration to harsh, remote locations such as the Arctic Circle, Greenland and Antarctica.

The company employed approximately 60 people in 3 countries as of 2018. Hilleberg&#x27;s headquarters, Hilleberg AB, is located in Frösön, Sweden and manages product and material development as well as European sales. In 2000, Petra Hilleberg founded the US division, Hilleberg, Inc., based in Redmond, Washington, which is responsible for marketing and sales outside of Europe. She is the President of both the Swedish and US branches. Manufacturing is performed in Rapla, Estonia, under Hilleberg Eesti and other European subcontractors.

Today, Bo Hilleberg is the chairman of the board and senior advisor to the product development team of Hilleberg and he, Renate Hilleberg, their son Rolf Hilleberg, and Petra Hilleberg make up the governing board of directors. Petra was named an honoree of both the 2012 SGB (Sporting Goods Business) 40 Under 40 Awards by the SportsOneSource Group and the 2012 Puget Sound Business Journal 40 Under 40 Awards.

<doc id="1064474" wikidata="Q1437981" url="?curid=1064474" title="Zhaleika">
<text>The zhaleika (), also known as bryolka (&quot;брёлка&quot;), is a Slavic wind instrument, most used in Belarusian, Russian and sometimes Ukrainian ethnic music. Also known as a &quot;folk clarinet&quot; or hornpipe. The zhaleika was eventually incorporated into the balalaika band, the Hungarian tarogato, and may have contributed to the development of the chalumeau, a predecessor of the clarinet.

==Construction and design==
The zhaleika consists of a single reed that can be covered by a mouthpiece (or &quot;wind cap&quot;). The design consists of a wooden barrel (pipe) with finger holes and a flared bell that can be made of either natural or man-made materials. It can either consist of a single or a double pipe.

The single pipe is about 10–20 cm long with 3 to 7 finger holes. The reed is made out of either cane or goose feather, and the end bell is made of cow horn or birch bark. The double type consists of two pipes and one bell, and is found mainly in the southern parts of Russia.

==Tuning==
The zhaleika has diatonic tuning and comes in various keys (G,A,D, sometimes C,E,F). It has a natural or &quot;normal&quot; soprano voice, but can perform in alto or piccolo forms. It is tuned by adjusting the reed and can be tuned to the major scale or mixolydian mode with flattened 7th note. Only an octave&#x27;s worth of notes can be played. Its timbre is described as &quot;piercing and nasal, sad and compassionate&quot;.
There are some chromatic variations of modern zhaleika too.

==Origination and uses==

The zhaleika was a shepherd&#x27;s instrument used to perform solos, duets, or ensemble pieces. The earliest single-reed pipe instruments date back to about 2700 BCE in Egypt, where most of these instruments most commonly had double pipes and used idioglot reeds. The earliest evidence of the zhaleika was in A. Tuchkov&#x27;s notes dating back to the late 18th century. It was widely spread in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania, but now can only be seen in folk music orchestras. In 1900, V. V. Andreyev incorporated a modified zhaleika - called &quot;bryolka&quot; - into orchestras. It consisted of a double-reed oboe type with additional finger holes and vents for chromatic scale.

In Slavic cultures &quot;zhaleika&quot; was a well known funeral instrument and its name is near to a word that means &quot;compassionate&quot;.
&quot;Zhaleika&quot; sounds in many compositions of Belarusian folk-metal band Znich, Ukrainian metal bands Chur and HASPYD, Ukrainian ethnic band DakhaBrakha.
&quot;Zhaleika&quot; sound like a one piped bagpipe.

<doc id="1064475" wikidata="Q353506" url="?curid=1064475" title="Joe Jordan">
<text>Joseph Jordan (born 15 December 1951) is a Scottish football coach, manager and former player. He was most recently a first-team coach at AFC Bournemouth.

A striker, he played for Leeds United, Manchester United, and Milan, among others at club level, as well making 52 appearances and scoring 11 goals for Scotland. As a player, he gained a fearsome &#x27;Jaws&#x27; persona due to having lost two front teeth early in his career. The persona aside, he became known as a strong, fearless and committed player, with skill to match, and good aerial abilities. He was part of the successful Leeds United team of the 1970s, winning the 1973–74 Football League First Division title. Cup success was elusive however, being a losing finalist with Leeds in the 1973 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final and 1975 European Cup final, and the 1979 FA Cup final with Manchester United. At international level he is the only Scottish player to score in three World Cups, in 1974, 1978 and 1982.

After retiring from playing, Jordan moved into coaching and management, at a number of clubs, most notably managing Heart of Midlothian in Scotland before later becoming first-team coach at Portsmouth under Harry Redknapp, with whom he has since developed a close working relationship, later following him to Tottenham Hotspur. In coaching and management he is described by Redknapp and others as an enigmatic coach who bears listening to, who has lost none of his &#x27;hard man&#x27; reputation as a player.

For his efforts for club and country as a player, he was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2005. He is considered a legend among the Tartan Army of Scotland fans, being best remembered for scoring the crucial goal against Czechoslovakia in 1973 which ensured Scotland qualified for their first World Cup finals in 16 years.

==Early life==
Jordan was born in the village of Cleland, Lanarkshire (sometimes given as the nearby town of Carluke). After leaving school, Jordan became an apprentice draughtsman. At age 15, Jordan had also begun playing for the Scottish Junior Football Association club, Blantyre Victoria.

==Club career==

===Morton===
Jordan began his professional career in 1968 at Morton. He initially played for Morton part-time. Jordan moved to Leeds United for £15,000 in 1970.

===Leeds United===
There was little prospect of Jordan making the Leeds first-team, as the partnership of Allan Clarke and Mick Jones was a well-established and successful duo. In 1973, he made 16 League starts and scoring nine goals. However, he was left out of the team that contested the FA Cup final against Sunderland, which Leeds lost 1–0. Don Revie selected him for the 1973 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final against Milan, another 1–0 defeat. Jordan was a regular in the following season, as Leeds won the League title. He scored seven goals in 25 League games.

By 1974, Jordan was Leeds&#x27; main target man, providing many knock-downs for Peter Lorimer to volley. Alongside other Scottish players at Leeds, Jordan formed part of the so-called &#x27;Scottish mafia&#x27;, alongside goalkeeper David Harvey (1965–1980, 1982–1984), defender Gordon McQueen (1972–1978), midfielder Billy Bremner (1959–1976), left winger Eddie Gray (1965–1983) and right winger Peter Lorimer (1963–1979, 1983–1986). Jordan was the Leeds number 9 in the team which lost the 1975 European Cup final 2–0 to Bayern Munich. With Leeds in decline, Jordan moved to Manchester United in January 1978 for £350,000. His final league record for Leeds was 39 goals from 135 games. His Leeds and Scotland colleague Gordon McQueen soon followed. The deal set a new transfer fee record for a transfer between two English clubs.

===Manchester United===
As the new Manchester United number 9, Jordan reached the 1979 FA Cup final, losing 3–2 to Arsenal. During a 1980 FA Cup third round replay at Old Trafford, Jordan clashed with Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, dislocating Aleksic&#x27;s jaw. &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2011 described this as a revenge act for Aleksic having repeatedly been charging Jordan during corners. It became known as the game that saw Tottenham&#x27;s Glenn Hoddle play in goal. Jordan remained at Old Trafford until 1981, when he moved to Italy to Milan.

===Milan===
Jordan spent two seasons playing for Milan, scoring 12 goals in 52 league games. This was the 1981–82 season in the Italian top division, Serie A, and the 1982–83 season in Italian second division, Serie B. In his first season, he scored two goals in 22 league games, but after a bad run of results, the club was relegated to Serie B as the third last finishers in Serie A, one point behind Genoa. In the second season he scored 10 goals in 30 league games, and the club returned to Serie A, being promoted as Serie B champions, eight points ahead of Lazio. In all competitions, Jordan was joint top-scorer for the club, with six goals alongside Roberto Antonelli in the first season, and 14 alongside Aldo Serena in the second season.

On the eve of a return to the club in a Champions League game in 2011, as a coach with Tottenham, Jordan said the move to Milan, one of the biggest clubs in the world, was the best move of his career, and it gave him a chapter in it that he had always wanted, a chance to play abroad.

===Hellas Verona===
After two seasons with Milan, instead of playing again in Serie A with them, Jordan moved to another Italian club Hellas Verona of the northern city of Verona. While Milan had been in Serie B for Jordan&#x27;s last season there, Verona had finished fourth in the 1982–83 Serie A, earning a place in the UEFA Cup. The next season, both clubs finished the 1983–84 Serie A in equal sixth place.

Having caught the eye of Verona for his brave, strong and combative performance in Serie B for Milan, they sought to use Jordan&#x27;s strength to play up front alongside the up and coming players Maurizio Iorio or Giuseppe Galderisi, who were fast and nimble but lacked strength, and were thought to be unable to play together, being an &#x27;odd-couple&#x27;. From the start of the season Jordan played 24 games, 12 in the league, but only scored two goals: one in the league, the other in the Italian Cup. This poor form ultimately led Verona to drop Jordan and settle on the pairing of Iorio and Galderisi until the end of the season, with Jordan returning to England after that one season, credited at least with having passed on valuable experience to Iorio and Galderisi and other young players at the club.

===Later career===
On his return to England, Jordan joined Southampton for £150,000. He remained with the club until February 1987, by when he had lost his place to Colin Clarke. He was then given a free transfer to Bristol City, where he finished his playing career, and was briefly player-manager.

At his retirement from playing, Jordan had made a total of 456 club appearances. In 2011, he described his three seasons in Italy as the best experience of his career.

==International career==

On 19 May 1973, three days after appearing in the European Cup Winners Cup final for Leeds, Jordan played his first game for the Scotland national team, a 1–0 defeat to England at Wembley. In 1973, as part of the qualification campaign for the 1974 World Cup to be held in West Germany, Jordan scored with a flying header in what turned out to be a crucial winning goal, in a 2–1 win against Czechoslovakia at Hampden Park in Glasgow. Securing Scotland a place at the finals, this was the first time they had qualified for the World Cup since 1958, failing at three previous attempts.

Jordan earned nine more Scotland caps by the end of the 1973–74 season, scoring two goals on the way, which saw him be selected for the finals. At the 1974 World Cup, Jordan scored the second goal in a 2–0 win over Zaire in the first group game, and a last minute equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Yugoslavia. Scotland finished the group unbeaten, but went out of the competition at the group stage on goal difference.

In the second to last game of the qualification campaign for the 1978 World Cup to be held in Argentina, Jordan won a controversial penalty against their opponents Wales, said to have helped Scotland to qualify at their expense. Jordan and the Welsh defender David Jones went to challenge for the ball in the Welsh penalty area, from a throw-in by Scotland midfielder Asa Hartford. The referee decided Jones had handled the ball, and awarded Scotland a penalty, although TV replays later showed that it was in fact Jordan&#x27;s hand which made contact with the ball (and also that he kissed his hand once the penalty was awarded). The penalty was converted, and the eventual 2–0 win for Scotland secured qualification by winning UEFA Group 7. He was selected by Ally MacLeod in the Scotland squad for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. Jordan scored the opening goal in their first match against Peru, but Scotland went on to lose 3–1. Scotland again failed to qualify beyond the group stage, after a 1–1 draw with Iran and a 3–2 win against the Netherlands.

Jordan was again selected for the Scotland squad in the 1982 World Cup. Scotland once again failed to progress beyond the group stages, but a personal milestone was achieved when he scored in the 2–2 draw against the Soviet Union. This meant that Jordan had scored in three successive World Cup Finals. Unfortunately he was injured in the same match, and never played for his country again. In total, Jordan earned 52 international caps, scoring 11 goals, and is the only Scottish player to have scored in three World Cups.

==Coaching and management career==

===Bristol City===
Moving into management, Jordan&#x27;s first job was at Bristol City which saw the club reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. He managed the club from March 1988 to September 1990, for 134 games. During this time, he initially struggled in his first season in charge, but following a number of key signings – most notably Bob Taylor, from Leeds – he took City to promotion in the 1989–90 season, finishing second behind local rivals Bristol Rovers.

===Hearts===
In 1990 Jordan was appointed manager of the Scottish Premier Division club Heart of Midlothian, based in the capital, Edinburgh. After a poor start to the 1990 campaign, Hearts had sacked their manager of eight years Alex MacDonald, and turned to Jordan as a high-profile ex-Scotland international striker. He took charge of the club from 10 September.

Jordan guided Hearts to second place in the Premier Division, and to two Scottish Cup semi-finals. With 63 points from 44 games, the club finished second in the 1991–92 Scottish Premier Division, nine points behind the champions Rangers and one point ahead of third placed Celtic. Hearts led the league for a significant part of the season, losing just two of their first 28 games. In the 1991–92 Scottish Cup they were eliminated in a penalty shoot-out against Airdrieonians, after two drawn matches. In the 1992–93 Scottish Cup they lost 2–1 away to Rangers.

After a poor run in the 1992–93 season, which featured a 6–0 loss to Falkirk, later described by the club as a thrashing, the board sacked Jordan. Jordan left the club on 3 May 1993, having registered 69 wins, 31 draws and 43 losses, from 143 competitive games. Speaking in 2010, Jordan expressed bitterness over his departure from Hearts, asserting he had done &quot;particularly well&quot; and the dismissal was undeserved, but reflecting &quot;That&#x27;s life, you get on with it, nobody&#x27;s going to listen to your sad stories, but that was a sore one&quot;.

===Celtic===
After Hearts, in 1993 Jordan became assistant manager to Liam Brady at Celtic, said to be out of an emotional attachment to the club he supported as a boy, and to Brady. Having been in the job since 1991, Brady resigned just four months after Jordan arrived, and he felt obliged to do the same, stating in 2010 that he felt no regrets and that &quot;You&#x27;ve just got to make those calls.&quot;

===Stoke City===
Jordan was appointed manager of Stoke City in November 1993 taking over from fellow Scot Lou Macari who had left to join Celtic. Jordan was not a popular choice amongst the supporters at the Victoria Ground as it looked likely that Denis Smith was to become their manager. They eventually accepted Jordan as the new manager but his style of play soon began to cause grumblings from the terraces but the side slowly got results going if not the quality of football on offer, Stoke finishing the 1993–94 season in 10th position. The 1994–95 season saw no change in the relationship between Jordan and the supporters and it came as little surprise when after a couple of heavy 4–0 defeats he resigned on 8 September 1994. He was replaced by the returning Lou Macari.

===Bristol City===
Returning to Bristol City for a second spell, he managed the club from November 1994 to March 1997 for another 130 games.

===Northern Ireland===
Between 1998 and 2000, he was assistant manager to Lawrie McMenemy as they unsuccessfully tried to get Northern Ireland to qualify for the 2000 European Championships.

===Huddersfield Town===
From December 2000 until May 2002, he was assistant to his former Manchester United team-mate Lou Macari at Huddersfield Town.

===Portsmouth===
In 2004, after a recommendation, Jordan was brought into the coaching team at Portsmouth by manager Harry Redknapp to work alongside him and his assistant manager, Kevin Bond. Under Redknapp, Jordan went on to win the 2008 FA Cup Final with Portsmouth. They beat Cardiff City 1–0 at Wembley Stadium on 17 May.

While working as a coach under Redknapp at Portsmouth, Jordan said of his career and the possibility of future management roles, with clubs or Scotland, &quot;I&#x27;m still ambitious and I&#x27;m desperate to do well here, along with the other people...I wouldn&#x27;t rule [management] out, but I&#x27;m not chasing it. I get on well with [Redknapp] and we hope that we can achieve something. I won&#x27;t go chasing every job that&#x27;s going, I know what I am and what I can do, but I&#x27;m not going down the route of applying for jobs.&quot;

Jordan continued to coach the team under the management of Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. He took over as caretaker manager for two games in November 2005 after Perrin&#x27;s departure, before Redknapp returned after resigning from Southampton.

On the morning of 26 October 2008, after agreeing a compensation deal of £5m, Redknapp left Portsmouth to become the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur. This left assistant manager Tony Adams and first-team coach Jordan to take charge of the team for the 1–1 home draw against Fulham the same day.

On the question of whether both would follow him, when he left Redknapp said he believed former Arsenal player Adams would not follow due to the Tottenham-Arsenal rivalry, but said &quot;Joe Jordan has been fantastic for me and I would always be pleased to have him with me anywhere. But he is at Portsmouth at the moment and it is up to him and the club to see what will happen in the future.&quot; On his appointment as the permanent Portsmouth manager two days later, Adams said he was keen to keep Jordan, stating &quot;Joe is Portsmouth through and through, he&#x27;s part of the woodwork, but he&#x27;s a big man and will make his own decision.&quot;

===Tottenham===
On 7 November 2008 Jordan left Portsmouth to join Redknapp at Tottenham Hotspur as first-team coach, reforming the original Portsmouth back room team after Redknapp had also brought the recently sacked AFC Bournemouth manager Kevin Bond as Tottenham assistant manager. Portsmouth praised Jordan&#x27;s &quot;significant contribution&quot; on his departure after four years at the club.

===Queens Park Rangers===
In November 2012, Jordan re-united with Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers as first-team coach.

===Middlesbrough===
On 17 March 2017, Jordan was appointed as assistant first-team manager under caretaker manager Steve Agnew at Middlesbrough. Jordan left his post at the end of the 2016–17 season.

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 25 February 2021, AFC Bournemouth announced that Jordan had joined the coaching staff. Jordan left his role after the 2020-21 season, upon the expiration of his contract.

==Recognition==
In 2005, Jordan was one of 11 players inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. Having been born in 1951, Jordan was the second youngest of the 2005 inductees, behind the then Rangers manager Alex McLeish, born in 1959, and with the oldest being Charles Campbell, born &quot;circa 1850s&quot;. Honouring the &quot;truly great players, managers and officials who have reached the pinnacle of their profession and have made a significant contribution to Scotland&#x27;s football reputation through their skill, spirit and determination&quot;, the induction followed the inaugural 20 Hall of Fame entrants, inducted in November 2004. Citing his &quot;highly successful career at club level&quot; at Leeds, Manchester United and Milan, the Hall of Fame stated Joe would probably be best remembered for his crucial 1973 World Cup qualifying goal against Czechoslovakia.

According to STV in 2010, for his efforts for the Scotland national team as &quot;braveheart Joe&quot;, for the &quot;all round bravery and commitment to the cause whenever he [played for Scotland]&quot; and particularly the crucial goal against Czechoslovakia in 1973, and the controversial penalty against Wales in 1977 (described as the &#x27;hand of Joe&#x27;, in reference to the later infamous Hand of God goal in 1986), Jordan&#x27;s &quot;status as a Scottish legend is safely assured&quot; among the Tartan Army of Scotland&#x27;s supporters. According to &quot;The Herald&quot;, Jordan&#x27;s hero status took hold with the goal against Czechoslovakia, due to both its significance and the fact it had been seemingly scored &quot;as if it were an act of sheer will.&quot;

On the occasion of the 110th anniversary of A.C. Milan, Jordan has been included in the list of the &quot;110 most important players in the history of A.C. Milan&quot; .

Jordan is described by &quot;The Herald&quot; as having crossed two eras in his career – having been a Scottish player at the time they were revered in the English game, he has gone on to coach in England as one of seven Scottish managers or coaches in the Premier League. He attributes this to a common determination and desire to win. In contrast to his playing career, Jordan has lamented the state of the game in Scotland in the late 2000s, which has seen a decline in domestic and international Scottish football, and profile of Scottish players in England, and a drying up of opportunities and even the availability of up and coming local players, contrasted to his era with contemporaries like Asa Hartford, Kenny Dalglish and Danny McGrain.

==&#x27;Jaws&#x27; persona==
Jordan was nicknamed &quot;Jaws&quot; early in his playing career due to his lack of front teeth, which had been knocked out during a Leeds United reserve match after he was kicked in the face during a goalmouth scramble. Although they were replaced by dentures, these were removed for safety reasons while playing. In Italy Jordan was nicknamed &quot;Lo Squalo&quot; (&quot;The Shark&quot;). When Jordan was manager of Bristol City, fans in the stands waved giant inflatable teeth. According to &quot;The Times&quot; in 2009, images of Jordan&#x27;s &quot;ferocious fangs as a player still regularly [appeared in] Scottish newpapers [sic] whenever an excuse can be found to hark back to the game&#x27;s golden age&quot;. Jordan was involved in several confrontations during his time at Tottenham, including with Roy Hodgson, Paul Ince, Alan Pardew, Andy Woodman, and Gennaro Gattuso. Jordan said in 2010 that he rejected the caricature that went along with his persona, stating &quot;I was what I was, but I look back and I had seven years at Leeds, who were one of the top teams in Europe, then I got a transfer to Manchester United, then a transfer to AC Milan. These are top clubs, and I had opportunities to go to Liverpool, Arsenal, Ajax. I&#x27;m not saying that to brag; if those teams thought I had something to offer, it was more than having no teeth.&quot;

==Playing and management style==
As one of the nominees for a public vote organised in April 2010 by STV to name &#x27;Scotland&#x27;s Greatest Team&#x27;, Jordan was described as an &quot;uncompromising, old fashioned centre forward who was never afraid to put his head where it hurts for club and country&quot;, adding that during the 1970s and 1980s &quot;there were few more fearsome sights in world football&quot; than Jordan.

In a 2007 list compiled by &quot;The Times&quot; Jordan was ranked as the 34th hardest man in the history of the game, with the citation &quot;There have been few more fearsome sights in the European game than &#x27;Jaws&#x27; Jordan without his front teeth.&quot; David O&#x27;Leary, when reflecting on his entire playing career as a defender (spent mostly at Arsenal between 1975 and 1993) he said of Jordan that he was the most combative forward he had ever faced. He has also been described as a powerhouse in aerial play.

Citing his dislocation of Milija Aleksic&#x27;s jaw in 1980 as an example, &quot;The Independent&quot; described in 2011 how Jordan was a player who &quot;did not stand for nonsense on the pitch&quot;. According to &quot;The Herald&quot; writing in 2010, alongside his strong play, which due to the way the game was played at that time was almost a necessity if forwards wanted to succeed, Jordan also had a refinement to his game.

Following the clash with Gattuso, playing on his hardman reputation, &quot;The Independent&quot; listed the &quot;Five reasons not to mess with Joe Jordan&quot;. Redknapp has said of Jordan as a coach that &quot;You could put your life on him... He is quiet, but when he says something, it is worth listening to.&quot;

In coaching, Jordan is described by &quot;The Herald&quot; as still having the presence and natural authority he had as a player, and of having an enigmatic solemnity about him. In the same interview, while living in Bristol, Jordan was described as having the intensified Scottish patriotism of an exile, who was willing to seize the opportunity to manage the Scotland national team since 2002.

==Personal life==
Jordan has two sons who have both played professional football: Tom and Andy (who retired due to injury after leaving Hartlepool United). One of his two daughters lives and works in Italy. He has an interest in fine wines, picked up from his time playing in Italy. Jordan supported Celtic as a boy. As of March 2010, Jordan lived with his family in Bristol.

<text>Backlund is a worn lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon, beyond the eastern limb, astride the southern rim of the walled plain Pasteur, to the west of the crater Hilbert. Further to the west-southwest is Sklodowska. Backlund&#x27;s north and south ends are more worn and eroded than the intervening stretches. The interior floor is relatively flat, with the usual accompaniment of tiny impact craters marking the surface.

The name &quot;Backlund&quot; honours the Swedish-born Russian astronomer Oskar Andreevich Baklund (, 1846-1916).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Backlund.

<text>Dermot John Murnaghan (; born 26 December 1957) is a British media personality, notable as a journalist, news reporter and television host. He has been a presenter for numerous networks including at Channel 4, a news presenter at CNBC Europe, Independent Television News and BBC News. He has presented news programmes in a variety of time slots since joining Sky News in 2007, until the end of February 2023.

He also presented the BBC quiz show &quot;Eggheads&quot; between 2003 and 2014 before Jeremy Vine took over full-time.

On 8 September 2022, &quot;Sky News&quot; was the first British television media outlet to report that monarch Queen Elizabeth II had died, with Murnaghan presenting the afternoon rolling coverage live.

==Early life and education==
Murnaghan was born in Barnstaple, Devon in south-west England. He and his family later moved to Northern Ireland, first to Armagh, then to Newry, County Down, and then to Holywood.

Murnaghan was educated at two schools in Northern Ireland: St Malachy&#x27;s Primary School in Armagh and Sullivan Upper School (a grammar school) in Holywood. He later attended the University of Sussex in England, graduating with a master&#x27;s degree in History in 1980. He also completed a postgraduate course in Journalism at City University London.

==Career==
===Journalism and Channel 4===

Murnaghan worked as a trainee reporter on local newspapers before joining Channel 4 as a researcher and later a reporter for &quot;The Business Programme&quot;.

Murnaghan briefly presented the European Business Channel in Switzerland before returning to the UK in 1989 to present the business segments on Channel 4&#x27;s new breakfast programme &quot;The Channel 4 Daily&quot;, after which he became the show&#x27;s main presenter in 1991, after the departure of original anchor Carol Barnes, until the programme ended in September 1992. During that same period, he was also a relief presenter on Channel 4 News when the regular host Jon Snow was unavailable, also anchoring Channel 4&#x27;s weekend news summary bulletins until the end of 1992.

===Presenter at ITV===
Murnaghan then joined ITV, presenting programmes such as the &quot;ITV Lunchtime News&quot; and &quot;News at Ten&quot;. Between 1993 and 1997 he fronted approximately 100 episodes of current affairs series &quot;The Big Story&quot;. In 1997, as an ITN news presenter, Murnaghan broke the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales to viewers on ITV. He later presented the &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; and the &quot;ITV Nightly News&quot; when ITV relaunched their news output in 1999. He also worked on ITV&#x27;s general election coverage in 2001.

===BBC===
From September 2002 to December 2007 Murnaghan was a main presenter of &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, replacing Jeremy Bowen. He presented the show alongside Sophie Raworth, Natasha Kaplinsky, Kate Silverton, Sian Williams and Susanna Reid. He was also a regular stand-in on the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;BBC Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and co-presented the &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; on Fridays from September 2003 to summer 2007 alongside Sian Williams. His presenting style was lampooned in the impersonation sketch show &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; by Jon Culshaw, his widely spaced legs on the presenting couch mocked with the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m Dermot Murnaghan, watch my crotch follow you round the room.&quot;

Whilst at the BBC, he co-presented BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; (2002–2003), a revival of an earlier format on Channel 4 alongside Suzi Perry. He co-presented BBC Breakfast from Monday to Thursday as well as regularly fronting national BBC news bulletins until December 2007.

===Sky News===
In October 2007, it was announced that Murnaghan would be leaving the BBC for Sky News. Murnaghan became the second news presenter to depart the corporation in the same month – Natasha Kaplinsky also left to join Five News, produced by Sky. His last time presenting Breakfast was 20 December 2007.

===Hosting===
Murnaghan presented the BBC Two daytime show &quot;Eggheads&quot; from 2003 until 2014, as well as its short-lived spin-off series &quot;Are You an Egghead?&quot; in 2008 and 2009. Following his move to Sky News he shared this role with Jeremy Vine, who subsequently became the sole presenter in series 16. Murnaghan has guest presented reports for different travel shows including ITV&#x27;s &quot;Wish You Were Here...?&quot; and BBC One&#x27;s rival programme &quot;Holiday&quot;. He has made cameos as a newsreader in the 2004 film &quot;Wimbledon&quot;, &quot;Absolute Power&quot; and &quot;Midnight Man&quot;.

===Return to Sky News===
From January 2011 until December 2016, Murnaghan presented his own show entitled &quot;Murnaghan&quot; on Sky News that aired on Sunday mornings from 10 am until 12 noon. Since September 2016, he has presented &quot;Sky News Tonight&quot; from Monday to Thursday. For the 2019 general election Murnaghan hosted Sky News&#x27; overnight coverage, entitled &quot;The Brexit Election&quot;.

On the night of 8 September 2022, Dermot Murnaghan announced the death of Queen Elizabeth II, presenting the afternoon rolling news coverage following an announcement from Buckingham Palace earlier in the day as Sky News was the first television news organisation to report her passing.

==Controversies==
===Chuka Umunna interview===
On 19 January 2015, Murnaghan was criticised for his supposedly hostile attitude towards Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna during an interview where Murnaghan asked Umunna if he agreed with the statement sent by the Communities Secretary to the Muslim community earlier in the day. Umunna acknowledged that he had not read it, though Murnaghan nonetheless continued to press the Shadow Business Secretary, resulting in an abrupt end to the interview after Murnaghan cut-off Umunna mid-speech by saying &quot;so you are not going to speak until you get the party line right?&quot; Umunna stormed out of the interview at this point. Viewers complained about the &quot;poor attitude&quot; exhibited by Murnaghan during the interview.

===President Toomas Hendrik Ilves interview===
On 8 February 2015, Murnaghan introduced the Estonian president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, as Toomas Hendrik and proceeded to call him &quot;President Hendrik&quot;. President Ilves removed his microphone and left, saying &quot;Tell him to shut up, he can&#x27;t even get my name right.&quot;

===Raheem Kassam interview===
On 14 February 2016, Murnaghan confronted British political activist and UKIP member Raheem Kassam on why he was not wearing a poppy in the United States. Kassam explained he forgot to place it in his new suit jacket but had donated £300 to the Royal British Legion. Murnaghan continued to press him, stating that it was &quot;disrespectful&quot; and that his news colleagues would be &quot;heavily criticised&quot; if they chose not to wear a poppy even if they donated. Kassam retorted they are &quot;rightly criticised&quot; for choosing not to wear one, which was &quot;not applicable&quot; in his case as he had simply forgotten it. Murnaghan quickly changed topic after Kassam&#x27;s retort, which Kassam highlighted.

==Personal life==
In August 1989, Murnaghan married Maria Keegan in Camden; they have four children. They live together in North London. Murnaghan is an Arsenal fan.

In 2006, Murnaghan became president of the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) and presented the TRIC Awards 2007.

On 9 March 2017, Murnaghan was involved in a hit and run accident. He was cycling through Kentish Town, northwest London, to his work at Sky News when the accident took place. Speaking to Sky News, Murnaghan said the driver of the car which hit him had been using a mobile phone when the incident occurred. The accident forced Murnaghan to be off air from his Sky News show and resulted in his having large bruise marks on the left-hand side of his face. Murnaghan thanked a &quot;good Samaritan&quot; who saw what had happened and told him that the car had sped off.

In 2012, he hit the headlines after tabloid pictures emerged of him kissing Sky make-up artist Camilla Tew in a London park.

<doc id="1064495" wikidata="Q856852" url="?curid=1064495" title="Équinoxe">
<text>Équinoxe (, ) is the fourth studio album by French electronic musician and composer Jean-Michel Jarre, released in December 1978 on the Dreyfus record label, licensed to Polydor Records for its worldwide distribution in 1979. The album featured two singles: &quot;Équinoxe Part 4&quot; and &quot;Équinoxe Part 5&quot;, the latter having more success reaching No. 45 on the UK Singles Chart. It reached number 11 on the UK Album Chart and number 126 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

== Composition and recording ==
The album was recorded from January to August 1978 in the makeshift recording studio set up in his apartment in Paris. The making of the album was done with a 16-track MCI tape. Jarre stated that although his previous album &quot;Oxygène&quot; was created without a concept in mind, &quot;Équinoxe&quot; was intended to represent a day in the life of a person, from waking up in the morning to sleeping at night.

The aquatic, rain, storm and thunder sounds that play on various tracks were designed by French sound engineer Michel Geiss. Apart from using the ARP 2600, Jarre also used liberal echo whips in the various sound effects generated by the EMS VCS 3 synthesizer. Both the Eminent 310 Unique organ and the VCS 3 went through an Electro Harmonix Small Stone guitar phasing pedal in order to provide the string pads used on the album. The main sound of &quot;Équinoxe Part 1&quot; was created using Eminent&#x27;s SUST string configuration. The album also used the Korg KR 55 drum machine.

Jarre&#x27;s musical ideas were initially recorded on a small cassette recorder, &quot;as an audio scratch pad&quot;. Jarre considered discarding one of the recordings as he did not think that it was good enough, but Geiss convinced him to keep it, and the track later became &quot;Équinoxe Part 7&quot;. Jarre also told Geiss that one of his wishes was to get a sequencer based on a matrix. Geiss designed the Matrisequencer 250, an 2x50 note instrument which &quot;became one of the main instruments in &quot;Équinoxe&quot;.&quot; The Rhythmicomputer designed by Geiss also was used. The album was mixed at Gang Studio by Jean-Pierre Janiaud with assistance from Patrick Foulon.

== Artwork ==
As with &quot;Oxygène&quot;, the cover art for &quot;Équinoxe&quot; used a painting by Michel Granger, in this case, &quot;Le trac&quot; (&quot;Stage Fright&quot;). Granger visited Jarre&#x27;s private mansion in Croissy to present him with different paintings that would illustrate the album cover. Each of the canvases was projected by light cannons, and &quot;Le trac&quot; was immediately chosen by Jean-Michel.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Équinoxe&quot; was released in December 1978 by Disques Dreyfus and internationally by Polydor Records, The album was promoted in London, UK. Two singles were released from the album, &quot;Équinoxe Part 4&quot; and &quot;Équinoxe Part 5&quot;, the latter having more success reaching No. 45 on the UK Singles Chart and was described as a &quot;synth-pop primer.&quot; The release was followed by a laser show and fireworks directed by Disques Dreyfus outside the Palais des Festivals, Cannes where the album was broadcast at high volume on the public address system, and also by a February 1979 promotional tour in the United States.

A concert on the Place de la Concorde, Paris was held on 14 July of that year. The concert attracted over a million people, at the time the largest crowd for an outdoor concert. Although it was not the first time he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40 minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre&#x27;s future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and the Frenchman Francis Rimbert featured at the event. Along with its 1976 predecessor, both sold more than 1.5 million copies in France and in 1981, it would be certified platinum, in November 1979, both sold 11 million worldwide.

==Critical reception==
Contemporary critical reception for the album in the UK was negative. Davitt Sigerson of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said &quot;it is as slushily, pseudo-galactically crass and vapid as last year&#x27;s &quot;Oxygène&quot;. The melodies are trite, harmonies predictable, textures almost determinedly hackneyed (even down to artificial &#x27;weather&#x27; effects to generate mood). There isn&#x27;t even much that&#x27;s danceable.&quot; In &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Steve Gett called the album &quot;very artificial and as a result quite emotionless.&quot; He continued saying that, &quot;As far as i was concerned the effect was one of sleep inducement, basically because it seems so lifeless and infinite, never reaching a specific goal but merely drifting on.&quot;

In the US, &quot;Cashbox&quot; wrote that &quot;the result is a complex, starkly-toned album which is surprisingly accessible and invigorating. Although even liberal AOR stations may hesitate to place this LP on steady rotating, Jarre&#x27;s sizable following plus adventurous rock fans will find this LP fascinating.&quot; &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; described the album as &quot;a moody, melodic, masterful synthesizer symphony&quot; and &quot;a dazzling musical poem, a pleasure to listen to, a delight to experience.&quot; In &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, William D. Loffler commented that the &quot;titles are meaningless because the music is something like a stretched-out electronic tone poem.&quot; Retrospective reviews of the album have been more favourable. Phil Alexander of &quot;Mojo&quot; listed it as one of Jarre&#x27;s three key albums, noting the influence of abstract art and classical composers Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel and Nino Rota on &quot;Équinoxe&quot;, and wrote that &quot;Jarre attempted to trace the human experience from morning to night across eight tracks on an album that is sensual and, in places, deeply melancholic.&quot;

Mike DeGagne of AllMusic commented, &quot;As the follow-up album to &quot;Oxygène&quot;, &quot;Équinoxe&quot; offers the same mesmerizing effect, with rapid spinning sequencer washes and bubbling synthesizer portions all lilting back and forth to stardust scatterings of electronic pastiches. Using more than 13 different types of synthesizers, Jarre combines whirling soundscapes of multi-textured effects, passages, and sometimes suites to culminate interesting electronic atmospheres... So much electronic color is added to every track that it is impossible to concentrate on any particular segment, resulting in waves of synth drowning the ears at high tide.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Équinoxe Part 1&quot;, and &quot;Équinoxe Part 2&quot; were used in the Mexican telenovela &quot;&quot;Los Ricos También Lloran&quot;&quot; starring Verónica Castro, and Rogelio Guerra. 

&quot;Équinoxe Part 1&quot;, &quot;Équinoxe Part 3&quot; and &quot;Équinoxe Part 4&quot; were used in &quot;&quot; by Carl Sagan, however they were not included on the series&#x27; soundtrack albums. In the 1984 computer game for Commodore 64, &quot;Loco&quot;, a remake of &quot;Équinoxe Part 5&quot; and &quot;Équinoxe Part 6&quot; by Ben Daglish was used. In 2018, four decades after the album&#x27;s release, Jarre produced a sequel, titled &quot;Equinoxe Infinity&quot;.

<text>Baco is a lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged southern highlands on the near side of the Moon. The rim and inner wall has been eroded and worn by countless minor impacts since the original formation of the crater. As a result, any s have been worn smooth and the rim is overlaid by several tiny craterlets. The interior floor is nearly flat, with no characteristic central peak at the midpoint and no small craters of significance.

There are several minor craters located in the surrounding terrain, including the satellite craters Baco A just to the south and Baco B to the northwest. Further to the north is the crater Breislak, and equally distant to the northeast is Ideler. Further to the west is Cuvier, while Asclepi lies to the southeast.

Although this crater was named after the Englishman Roger Bacon, it was chosen by the German astronomer von Mädler. Hence the crater name became modified from Bacon to Baco.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Baco.

<text>USS &quot;Gamble&quot; (DD–123/DM-15) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later converted to a minelayer in World War II.

==Namesakes==
Peter Gamble was born on 5 November 1793 in Bordentown, New Jersey. He was appointed midshipman on 16 January 1809 and served on Thomas Macdonough&#x27;s flagship in the Battle of Lake Champlain. He was killed in action while in the act of sighting his gun on 11 September 1814. Macdonough deplored Gamble&#x27;s loss and commended his gallantry in action.

John M. Gamble was the brother of Peter Gamble and achieved the rank of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corps.

No other ships in the United States Navy have borne this name.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Gamble&quot; was launched 11 May 1918 by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, sponsored by Miss Evelyn H. Jackson, a relative of Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. The ship was commissioned at Norfolk on 29 November 1918.

==Service history==
After shakedown training out of the Virginia Capes, &quot;Gamble&quot; sailed from New York City on 13 January 1919 to take part in maneuvers off Cuba; Key West, Florida; and the New England seaboard until June 1919. Following at Norfolk, she joined the Pacific Fleet at San Diego 7 August 1919 and operated along the Pacific coast until placed in reserve status in the Mare Island Navy Yard 1 December 1919. In October 1920, she came out of reserve and assisted the flotilla in torpedo practice; maneuvered with the Battle Force; and cruised along the California coast as a training ship for reservists. She decommissioned at San Diego on 17 June 1922.

&quot;Gamble&quot; recommissioned on 24 May 1930; was reclassified (DM-15) on 13 June, and converted into a light minelayer at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Arriving at Pearl Harbor from the West Coast, she became flagship of Mine Squadron 2 in July 1930 and later served as flagship of Mine Division 1, Mine Squadron 1. She patrolled Hawaiian waters instructing naval reservists in mine warfare and acted as plane guard and radio tracker for seaplanes, each year participating in fleet readiness and fleet problems until she returned to San Diego where she decommissioned on 22 December 1937. Recommissioning on 25 September 1939 as Europe was plunged into World War II, she joined Mine Division 5 in patrol and schoolship duties out of San Francisco. In April 1941, she proceeded to Pearl Harbor for war readiness patrol in Hawaiian waters as a unit of Mine Division 2.

===World War II===
On 7 December 1941, &quot;Gamble&quot; had returned from offshore patrol, when her peaceful routine was broken by the first of the Japanese carrier-based planes which attacked American ships in the harbor. &quot;Gamble&quot;″s gunners joined the fire of other warships and saw one enemy plane fall into the water on her port beam. When the U.S. Navy submarine surfaced off Pearl Harbor later that day in attempt to enter the harbor and get medical attention for a severely injured crewman, &quot;Gamble&quot; mistook her for a Japanese submarine and opened gunfire on her as she surfaced, forcing her to submerge again immediately. By the time &quot;Thresher&quot; was able to reach Pearl Harbor on 8 December, her injured crewman had died.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Gamble&quot; took antisubmarine patrol station in the screen of the aircraft carrier , and later guarded the approaches to Pearl Harbor. In mid-February 1942, she headed south in the escort for a convoy to Pago Pago, American Samoa, then joined in laying a protective minefield off Tutuila. At the end of March the two minelayers shifted to the Fiji Islands, to lay a minefield in Nadi waters from 7–14 April. Returning to Pearl Harbor for heavier armament, &quot;Gamble&quot; helped safeguard convoys to Midway during the time of that crucial and historic battle, then headed south with and to lay a defensive minefield off the entrance to Second Channel, Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Islands.

On 27 August 1942, &quot;Gamble&quot; joined a task unit headed to Guadalcanal. Although designated a destroyer-minelayer, the old vessel still carried antisubmarine gear. On the morning of 29 August, when her lookouts spotted a large enemy submarine, she immediately went into action. After several depth charge attacks, &quot;Gamble&quot; ran through large oil slicks, found deck planking, and observed a large air bubble break the surface. Later her victim was identified as , whose dying radio had signaled &quot;under heavy enemy attack.&quot; That afternoon she proceeded at full speed to Nura Island where she rescued four stranded aviators from the aircraft carrier . Continuing to aid in the struggle for Guadalcanal, she transported 158 Marines to the island on 31 August, patrolled off Lunga Roads, then on 5 September assisted in freeing and escorted her to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Islands. Her patrol, escort, and transport duty continued as the drive for Guadalcanal pressed on to victory.

Five minutes after midnight on 6 May 1943, &quot;Gamble&quot;, with and &quot;Breese&quot;, turned simultaneously in rain squalls which broke at times to disclose each to the other in perfect formation. Making , each ship dropped a mine every 12 seconds, planting over 250 mines in 17 minutes across Blackett Strait, the western entrance to Kula Gulf and directly in the favorite route of the Japanese &quot;Tokyo Express.&quot; The ships then sped north to join the protective screen of Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth&#x27;s cruiser-destroyer force before refueling at Tulagi. On the night of 7/8 May, four Japanese destroyers entered the mined waters. One, , went down, two others, and , were badly damaged and sent out calls for help that brought to the scene. Aircraft, alerted by a coastwatcher, intercepted the rescue operation, sinking the two destroyers and sending &quot;Michishio&quot; limping back to port, badly damaged.

On 30 June 1943, during the invasion of New Georgia, &quot;Gamble&quot; laid a string of mines off the beachhead, before returning to Tulagi. In July welcome orders sent her back to the United States for overhaul. She headed west again on 20 September 1943. Her minelaying duties then brought her to Empress Augusta Bay from 1–2 November 1943 to support landing operations; Bougainville Strait, 7–8 November; Purvis Bay, Florida Island, 23–24 November, thence to the New Hebrides Islands for escort duty among the Solomons until she returned to San Francisco on 12 October 1944.

After overhaul and refresher training, &quot;Gamble&quot; departed San Diego on 7 January 1945, en route via Hawaii and the Marshalls to Iwo Jima where she arrived on 17 February, to lend fire support to the various sweeping units, and to explode floating mines. During her shelling a direct hit on an ammunition dump exploded the enemy magazine at the foot of Mount Suribachi.

===Fate===
On 18 February 1945, &quot;Gamble&quot; was hit just above the waterline by two bombs. Both firerooms immediately flooded and she became dead in the water with two holes in her bottom as all hands fought raging fires, jettisoned topside weight and shored damaged bulkheads. Five men were killed, one missing in action, and eight wounded. As U.S. Marines stormed the shores of Iwo Jima the next day, &quot;Gamble&quot; was taken in tow by , who turned her over to &quot;LSM-126&quot; for passage to Saipan. She arrived at Saipan on 24 February and went alongside &quot;Hamul&quot; for repair.

&quot;Gamble&quot; was towed from Saipan to Guam May 16-17, 1945 by USS ATR-52.

Some hope remained for &quot;Gamble&quot; for a long time, but on 1 June 1945 she decommissioned, and, on 16 July, she was towed outside Apra Harbor, Guam and sunk.

==Awards==
&quot;Gamble&quot; received seven battle stars for service in World War II.

<doc id="1064507" wikidata="Q2528507" url="?curid=1064507" title="Marxist–Leninist Communist Party of Greece">
<text>The Marxist–Leninist Communist Party of Greece (, &quot;Marxistiko-Leninistiko Kommounistiko Komma Elladas&quot;), better known by its acronym M-L KKE (Μ-Λ ΚΚΕ), is an anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist communist party in Greece.

== History ==
M-L KKE originates in the Organisation of Marxists–Leninists of Greece (OMLE) that split away from the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) in 1964, opposing Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s De-Stalinization and supporting Mao Zedong and his political beliefs in the Sino-Soviet split. After Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, OMLE split into two major factions: the M-L KKE and the rival Communist Party of Greece (Marxist–Leninist) (KKE M-L), as well as further smaller groupings. M-L KKE and KKE M-L have remained the two largest Maoist parties in Greece since. Historically, M-L KKE has had a significant presence among teachers and education workers and is most active in West Macedonia, Alexandroupoli, Corfu, and Ikaria.

The group, which has published its own journal, &quot;Laikos Dromos&quot;, was led from its foundation by Isaac Jordanidis, who had been a functionary within the KKE. Jordanidis was a strong supporter of the Three Worlds Theory, and the group took a Maoist line as a result. A delegation from the party travelled to Beijing in 1977 where they held a meeting with Li Xiannian.

In the 2000 legislative election, M-L KKE and A/synechia participated together, receiving 5,866 votes. In the legislative election of 2004, M-L KKE participated alone, receiving 4,846 votes. In the 2007 legislative election, M-L KKE received 8,088 votes (0.11%).

On 16 March 2012, spurred by the ongoing Greek financial crisis, M-L KKE and KKE M-L announced that they would jointly contest elections as part of the Popular Resistance – Left Anti-Imperialist Cooperation (Λαϊκή Αντίσταση – Αριστερή Αντιμπεριαλιστική Συνεργασία), distancing themselves both from the traditional Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the leftist Syriza coalition.

== Newspaper ==

M-L KKE publishes the &quot;Laikos Dromos&quot; (Λαϊκός Δρόμος, &quot;People&#x27;s Path&quot;) newspaper, founded in December 1967 as OMLE&#x27;s newspaper.

<doc id="1064512" wikidata="Q865725" url="?curid=1064512" title="Birmingham (crater)">
<text>Birmingham is the surviving remnant of a lunar impact crater. It is named after the astronomer John Birmingham (not, as is often stated, the British city nor its Alabama namesake). 
The crater is located near the northern limb of the Moon, and so is viewed from the Earth at a low angle.

All that survives of the original formation is an irregular perimeter of low, indented ridges surrounding the lava-resurfaced interior. The inner floor is marked by several tiny craterlets, and the surface is unusually rough for a walled plain. The low angle of illumination allows fine details of this boulder-strewn field to be seen more clearly.

==Location==
The Birmingham formation lies just to the north of the Mare Frigoris, and to the east of the walled plain W. Bond. To the northeast is the smaller crater Epigenes, with Fontenelle to the west.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Birmingham.

<doc id="1064513" wikidata="Q1118332" url="?curid=1064513" title="Monocacy River">
<text>The Monocacy River () is a free-flowing left tributary to the Potomac River, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean via the Chesapeake Bay. The river is long, with a drainage area of about . It is the largest Maryland tributary to the Potomac.

The name &quot;Monocacy&quot; comes from the Shawnee name for the river &quot;Monnockkesey&quot;, which translates to &quot;river with many bends.&quot; (However, another local tradition asserts that &quot;Monocacy&quot; means &quot;well-fenced garden&quot; in an Indian language.)

The Monocacy National Battlefield lies alongside part of the river, marking an 1864 engagement during the American Civil War, the Battle of Monocacy Junction. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal crosses over the river at the Monocacy Aqueduct, the largest of the 11 aqueducts on the canal.

== Geography ==
The river rises in Carroll County, Maryland, west of the unincorporated town of Harney at the Maryland-Pennsylvania border. The river is formed by the confluence of Marsh Creek and Rock Creek, which flow out of Adams County, Pennsylvania. Maryland tributaries include Furnace Branch, Tuscarora Creek, Carroll Creek, Linganore Creek and Ballenger Creek in Frederick County and Double Pipe Creek in Carroll County; other Pennsylvania tributaries include Alloway Creek and Toms Creek in Adams County.

About 60% of the Monocacy watershed is dedicated to agricultural use; about 33% of the watershed is forested. The city of Frederick and its suburbs form the largest urban area within the watershed.

The 970 square mile watershed averages a flow of 600 million gallons per day (Mgal/d) at the mouth where it enters the Potomac River.

=== Dendrology ===
The vegetation of the watershed is very similar to what one would expect to find through the Piedmont and valley and ridge regions, with some invasive species that threaten the balance of the ecosystem.

== Pollution ==
The State of Maryland designated the Monocacy as a Maryland Scenic River in 1974. However, it has one of the greatest nonpoint source pollution problems in the state due in large part to runoff from the 3,500 farms, livestock operations, and dairies in the watershed. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has listed the Monocacy with impaired water quality for nutrient pollution, sediment, and fecal coliform bacteria. A major tributary basin, the Double Pipe Creek watershed, is also impaired by these pollutants. A 2012 MDE report said that fish and other aquatic life in the river were severely impacted by pollution and loss of habitat.

Some farmers in the Monocacy watershed participate in the national Conservation Stewardship Program operated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), designed to help stem pollution due to erosion and pollutant runoff from farming. In the 1990s the watershed was part of a national water quality demonstration project sponsored by USDA, which helped farmers reduce fertilizer usage and reduced discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus to the river.

In 2020, the first indoor recreational multimedia park Soyuzmultfilm will be opened at the VDNKH exhibition center. A Technopark, which is to become the largest animation production centre in Russia, is being created on the basis of the studio.  

== History ==
=== Early years ===
The film studio was founded on 10 June 1936, by order of the Chief Directorate of the Film and Photo Industry (GUKF) of the State Committee on the Arts under the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the USSR. Two of the animated groups that existed in Moscow at that time were merged into a single film studio under the name Soyuzdetmultfilm, which was changed to Soyuzmultfilm in 1937. The studio was located at Novinsky Boulevard, 22.

The creative staff included already well-known masters of hand-drawn animation – Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Olga Khodataeva, Valentina and Zinaida Brumberg, Vladimir Suteev, , and others.

Three-months retraining courses were organized by the studio for all creative artists. The masters taught young animators the basics of professional skills. The studio turned into the main production base of Soviet animation and became a creative centre for animation of the USSR. In the early years, Soyuzmultfilm embraced the cel technique – the so-called Disney&#x27;s conveyor method, which was convenient for mass production of hand-drawn animation. Contour with a drawing pen and an exposure sheet borrowed from the Disney became essential elements of production. In the late 1930s, the studio began actively using the Eclair method (or rotoscoping), developed by the American animators Fleisher Brothers and Charles Mintz Studio. The reason was the reorientation of the studio to current topics and the need to create not only grotesque, but also heroic characters. From the very beginning, the studio took as a basis for production the principle of division of work into separate specialties (in-betweeners, ink artists, paint artists), which accelerated the process of production and made it cheaper.

For several years Soyuzmultfilm focused mainly on the creation of entertaining shorts for children with animal characters depicted in a Disney manner. One of the first cartoons created at the studio was the black-and-white &quot;&quot; (1936) by . That was the first experience of the famous children&#x27;s poet Sergei Mikhalkov in animation as a screenwriter.

Despite the chosen direction, many animators developed their own styles – in particular, Vladimir Suteev (&#x27; (1937) and &#x27; (1938).

Since 1937, the studio started to produce color films. The first experience was &quot;&quot; by . Many cartoons of 1938–1945 were made both in colou
Color and black-and-white.

If in 1936–1937 the animation was limited to the children&#x27;s themes within the genres of fables and fairy tales, then in 1938 it was ordered to direct Soviet cinema to contemporary issues. The studio&#x27;s repertoire policy was changed, it again began to produce political films in the genres of the Soviet &quot;political fairy tale&quot;, political cartoons and agitprop posters. The possibility of portraying a person as a positive Soviet hero in animation was discussed. At that time, the films (&#x27; (1938) by , &#x27; (1939) by {{ill|Dmitry Babichenko were produced.

In the late 1930s – early 1940s, was a shift in priorities from quantity to quality indicators. Animator courses were resumed. Films created between 1939 and 1941 were subsequently included in the &quot;gold fund&quot; of world cinema: &quot;{{ill|Limpopo (1939 film)|lt=Limpopo|ru|Лимпопо (мультфильм)|WD=}}&quot; (1939) and &quot;{{ill|Barmaley|ru|Бармалей}}&quot; (1941) by Leonid Amalrik and {{ill|Vladimir Polkovnikov|ru|Полковников, Владимир Иванович}}, &quot;{{ill|Moydodyr (film)|ru|Мойдодыр (мультфильм, 1939)|lt=Moydodyr}}&quot; (1939) by Ivan Ivanov-Vano, &quot;Uncle Styopa&quot; (1939) and &quot;{{ill|Fly-Tsokotuha|ru|Муха-Цокотуха (мультфильм, 1941)}}&quot; (1941) by Vladimir Suteev. These cartoons defined the original &quot;Soviet style&quot; of animation.

=== War period ===
In the first months of the Great Patriotic War, all creative groups switched to producing anti-fascist propaganda posters. Many employees went to the front. In October, the part of the studio was evacuated to Samarkand, where the directors Mikhail Tsekhanovsky and {{ill|Mstislav Pashchenko|ru|Пащенко, Мстислав Сергеевич}} joined the team evacuated from the besieged Leningrad. They formed part of the Central United Film Studios team as a specialised division, independent from its leadership and keeping the brand. In Samarkand the studio worked in the strictest economy of materials and electricity. Scenarios were revised in order to simplify the production, which was extremely slow because of lack of materials and staff.

In 1943, Soyuzmultfilm returned to Moscow. In early 1944, the studio organized the first Arts Council. By the end of the 1940s, Korney Chukovsky, Samuil Marshak, Evgeny Schwartz, Sergey Bolotin, {{ill|Oleg Erberg|ru|Эрберг, Олег Ефимович}}, Mikhail Volpin, Nikolai Erdman, Valentin Kataev, Yury Olesha, {{ill|Boris Laskin|ru|Ласкин, Борис Савельевич}}, Lev Kassil, Vladimir Suteev, {{ill|Georgy Grebner|ru|Гребнер, Георгий Эдуардович}}, {{ill|Nikolai Klado|ru|Кладо, Николай Николаевич}}, {{ill|Georgy Berezko|ru|Берёзко, Георгий Сергеевич}}, {{ill|Nikolai Pavlovich Abramov|lt=Nikolai Abramov|ru|Абрамов, Николай Павлович|WD=}} were invited to cooperate with the studio.

Under difficult working conditions, several outstanding films were created:
* &quot;{{ill|The Fox, the Rabbit and the Rooster|ru|Лиса, заяц и петух (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1942) by Olga Khodataeva,
* &quot;{{ill|Cinema-Circus|ru|Киноцирк}}&quot; (1942) by Leonid Amalrik and Olga Khodataeva,
* &quot;{{ill|A New Year Tree|ru|Ёлка (Новогодняя сказка)}}&quot; (1942) by Mikhail Tsekhanovsky,
* &quot;{{ill|The Telephone (1944 film)|lt=The Telephone|ru|Телефон (мультфильм)|WD=}}&quot; (1944) by Mikhail Tsekhanovsky,
* &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot; (1942–1943) 
* &quot;{{ill|Sinbad the Sailor (1944 film)|lt=Sinbad the Sailor|ru|Синдбад-мореход (мультфильм, 1944)|WD=}}&quot; (1944) by the Brumberg sisters
* &quot;{{ill|The Stolen Sun|ru|Краденое солнце (мультфильм, 1944)}}&quot; (1944) by Ivan Ivanov-Vano.

In 1945, the studio produced its first feature film &quot;A Disappeared Diploma&quot; by Valentina and Zinaida Brumberg, based on the story with the same name by Nikolai Gogol.

=== The golden age ===
Soon after the end of the war, in 1946, Soyuzmultfilm moved its offices to the building at Kalyaevskaya street (now {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya Street|ru|Долгоруковская улица}}), 23A (the former {{ill|church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker in New Sloboda|ru|Церковь Николая Чудотворца в Новой Слободе}}, previously occupied by the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism).

In the post-war years, the studio stopped the direct lifts of American animation techniques, and the original aesthetic &quot;canon&quot; of the children&#x27;s Soviet cartoon was determined.

The best Soviet cartoons of the second half of the 1940s were distinguished by impressive plasticity and facial expressions, harmony of word and movement. A lot of new names appeared among the directors and artists of the studio: Lev Atamanov, Yevgeny Migunov, Leonid Shvartsman, {{ill|Alexander Vasilyevich Vinokurov|ru|Винокуров, Александр Васильевич|lt=Alexander Vinokurov}} and others. One of the main fundamental components of the Soviet cartoon school was continuity, when beginning animators gained professional experience from prominent artists and directors.

The most striking works of Soyuzmultfilm in the late 1940s were the animated films &quot;{{ill|The Flower with Seven Colors|ru|Цветик-семицветик (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1948) by Mikhail Tsekhanovsky, &quot;{{ill|Fedya Zaitsev|ru|Федя Зайцев}}&quot; (1948) by the Brumberg sisters, and &quot;{{ill|Little Gray Neck|ru|Серая Шейка}}&quot; (1948) by Leonid Amalrik and {{ill|Vladimir Polkovnikov|ru|Полковников, Владимир Иванович}}.

In 1947, Soyuzmultfilm received the first international award – &quot;{{ill|The Song of Joy|ru|Песенка радости}}&quot; (1946) by {{ill|Mstislav Pashchenko|ru|Пащенко, Мстислав Сергеевич}} was awarded the bronze medal at the Venice Film Festival for the Best Animated Film.

In 1951, the film &quot;The Humpbacked Horse&quot; (1947) by Ivan Ivanov-Vano received the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

In the first half of the 1950s, the studio released popular films, many of which were based on the use of the Eclair method:
* by Lev Atamanov
** &quot;{{ill|The Yellow Stork|ru|Жёлтый аист (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1950)
** &quot;The Scarlet Flower&quot; (1952)

* &quot;{{ill|The Naughty Kitten|ru|Непослушный котёнок}}&quot; (1953) by {{ill|Mstislav Pashchenko|ru|Пащенко, Мстислав Сергеевич}}

* &quot;{{ill|The Magic Shop (1953 film)|lt=Magic Shop|ru|Волшебный магазин|WD=}}&quot; (1953) by Leonid Amalrik and {{ill|Vladimir Polkovnikov|ru|Полковников, Владимир Иванович}}.

In 1953, the studio began the production of puppet films. One of the first stop motion animated films were &quot;{{ill|At the Dacha|ru|На даче (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1954) by {{ill|Grigory Lomidze|ru|Ломидзе, Григорий Захарович}} and &quot;Two Greedy Bear Cubs&quot; (1954) by {{ill|Vladimir Degtyarev|ru|Дегтярёв, Владимир Дмитриевич}}. The first major success of the puppet production was the directorial debut of Yevgeny Migunov &quot;{{ill|The Pencil and Blot –The Cheerful Hunters|ru|Карандаш и Клякса — весёлые охотники}}&quot; (1954), in which several technological innovations of making and shooting puppets were applied. Many employees of the {{ill|State Central Puppet Theater|ru|Театр кукол имени С. В. Образцова}} under the direction of Sergey Obraztsov joined the staff of the studio&#x27;s puppet association.

In 1956, having changed several addresses, the three-dimensional puppet film workshop received a permanent area in {{ill|Spasopeskovsky Lane|ru|Спасопесковский переулок}} (the building of the {{ill|Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior on the Sands|ru|Храм Спаса Преображения на Песках}}).

In 1959, the well-known motion picture &quot;{{ill|The Cloud in Love|ru|Влюблённое облако}}&quot; by Roman Kachanov and {{ill|Anatoly Karanovich|ru|Каранович, Анатолий Георгиевич}} was released, combining stop motion, traditional and cutout animation, and won a number of prestigious awards at international festivals, including the prize of the International Film Press Federation (FIPRESCI).

In the middle 1950s, the studio began to abandon the naturalistic representation of hand-drawn films, prioritizing more conventional forms. The volume of filmmaking increased (at the peak of production by the beginning of the 1970s, the studio released more than 30 films a year), including annual production of feature films.

In 1957, Lev Atamanov put into practice the technique of assigning individual animators to specific characters (e.g. the role of Ole Lukøje was completely &quot;played&quot; by Fyodor Khitruk in the film &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;).

Among the most famous feature films of the studio of the second half of the 1950s:
* &quot;The Enchanted Boy&quot; (1955) by Alexandra Snezhko-Blotskaya and {{ill|Vladimir Polkovnikov|ru|Полковников, Владимир Иванович}}, which became the laureate of many prestigious film screenings,
* &quot;The Island of Mistakes&quot; (1955) by the Brumberg sisters,
* &quot;{{ill|The Walnut Twig|ru|Ореховый прутик}}&quot; (1955) by {{ill|Ivan Aksenchuk|ru|Аксенчук, Иван Семёнович}},
* &quot;{{ill|The Fire Burns in the Yaranga|ru|В яранге горит огонь}}&quot; (1956) by Olga Khodataeva,

* &quot;{{ill|The Brave Little Deer|ru|Храбрый олененок}}&quot; (1957) by Olga Khodataeva and Leonid Aristov,
* &quot;{{ill|Little Ship (1956 film)|lt=Little Ship|ru|Кораблик (мультфильм)|WD=}}&quot; (1956), by Leonid Amalrik
* &quot;{{ill|The Cat’s House|ru|Кошкин дом (мультфильм, 1958)}}&quot; (1958) by Leonid Amalrik,
* &quot;{{ill|The Adventures of Murzilka|ru|Приключения Мурзилки}}&quot; (1956) by Boris Stepantsev and {{ill|Evgeny Raykovsky|ru|Райковский, Евгений Николаевич}},

* &quot;The Adventures of Buratino&quot; (1959) by Ivan Ivanov-Vano and Dmitry Babichenko

The studio also created cartoons for an adult audience:
* &quot;{{ill|The Illegible Signature|ru|Подпись неразборчива}}&quot; (1954) by {{ill|Alexander Vasilievich Ivanov|lt=Alexander Ivanov|ru|Иванов, Александр Васильевич (художник-мультипликатор)|WD=}},
* &quot;{{ill|The Villain&#x27;s Sticker|ru|Злодейка с наклейкой}}&quot; (1954) by {{ill|Vsevolod Shcherbakov|ru|Щербаков, Всеволод Сергеевич}} and Boris Stepantsev,

* &quot;{{ill|Familiar Pictures|ru|Знакомые картинки}}&quot; (1957) by Yevgeny Migunov
&quot;Familiar Pictures&quot; was shot entirely in an innovative for that time conventional manner.

=== Aesthetic switch ===
On the cusp of the 1960s, a crucial moment in the history of Russian animation occurred. The so-called &quot;aesthetic switch&quot; began with a whole galaxy of films:
* &quot;The Key&quot; (1961) by Lev Atamanov,
* &quot;{{ill|The Little Goat|ru|Козлёнок (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1961) by Roman Davydov,
* &quot;The Wild Swans&quot; (1962) by Mikhail and Vera Tsekhanovsky,
* &quot;{{ill|The Bath House (1962 film)|ru|Баня (мультфильм)|lt=The Bath House|WD=}}&quot; (1962) by {{ill|Anatoly Karanovich|ru|Каранович, Анатолий Георгиевич}} and Sergey Yutkevich,
* &quot;{{ill|The Flying Proletariat|ru|Летающий пролетарий (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1962) by Ivan Ivanov-Vano and Iosif Boyarsky
* Fyodor Khitruk’s directorial debut &quot;The Story of a Crime&quot; (1962).

Since the 1960s, the range of stylistic, genre and technological searches and solutions had been continuously expanded and developed. The old production system prevented art from moving forward, and Fyodor Khitruk introduced a &quot;team method&quot; of working, in which animators were involved in film production from the very beginning.

In the 1960s, Soyuzmultfilm was also actively developing puppet animation. Colour, decoration, texture of the material were applied in a new way. Semi-dimensional, bas-relief, including paper dolls began to be used. A new breakthrough in children&#x27;s puppet animation began with the famous films &quot;A Little Frog Is looking for His Father&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Mitten&quot; (1967) by Roman Kachanov, &quot;{{ill|Who Said Meow?|ru|Кто сказал «мяу»?}}&quot; (1962) and &quot;{{ill|The Little Goat Who Counted to Ten|ru|Козлёнок, который считал до десяти}}&quot; (1968) by {{ill|Vladimir Degtyaryov|ru|Дегтярёв, Владимир Дмитриевич}}.  

During these years, many new animators joined the studio&#x27;s puppet division: {{ill|Mikhail Kamenetsky|ru|Каменецкий, Михаил Абрамович}} and {{ill|Ivan Ufimtsev|ru|Уфимцев, Иван Васильевич}} (&quot;{{ill|Whose pine cones are in the forest?|ru|Чьи в лесу шишки?}}&quot; (1965)), {{ill|Vadim Kurchevsky|ru|Курчевский, Вадим Владимирович}} (&quot;{{ill|My Green Crocodile|ru|Мой зелёный крокодил}}&quot; (1966), &quot;{{ill|The Legend of Grig|ru|Легенда о Григе}}&quot; (1967), &quot;{{ill|Frantishek|ru|Франтишек (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1967)), Nikolay Serebryakov (&quot;{{ill|I&#x27;m expecting a baby bird|ru|Я жду птенца (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1966), &quot;Happiness Is Not in the Hat&quot; (1968), &quot;{{ill|Ball of Wool|ru|Клубок (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1968)).

In the 1960s, the production of satirical cartoons increased. Animation began to raise acute social and philosophical topics. Especially famous were
* &quot;{{ill|Big Troubles|ru|Большие неприятности (мультфильм)}}&quot; (1961) by the Brumberg sisters,
* &quot;{{ill|The Man in the Frame|ru|Человек в рамке}}&quot; (1966) by Fyodor Khitruk, &quot;Passion of Spies&quot; (1967) by Yefim Gamburg,
* &quot;There Lived Kozyavin&quot; (1966), and, banned by Soviet censorship,
* &quot;The Glass Harmonica&quot; (1968) by Andrei Khrzhanovsky.

In 1969, the animated anthology series &quot;Happy Merry-Go-Round&quot; was founded. The first release was produced under the direction of Roman Kachanov by the beginning directors Anatoly Petrov, Gennady Sokolsky, Leonid Nosyrev, {{ill|Valery Ugarov|ru|Угаров, Валерий Михайлович}} and {{ill|Galina Barinova|ru|Баринова, Галина Сергеевна}}, the world-recognised masters of animation today. The famous to this day &quot;{{ill|Antoshka|ru|Антошка}}&quot; and the first artistic presentation of &quot;Well, Just You Wait!&quot;, which was soon turned into a popular series of its own, were released exactly in the first run of &quot;Happy Merry-Go-Round&quot;. Experimental technologies, audacious concepts and innovation solutions were often used in the production of the shorts.

The period from the beginning of the 1970s to the middle 1980s is called the halcyon days of Soyuzmultfilm. At that time, it became the largest animation studio in Europe, that employed more than 500 people and released more than 1000 films.

Throughout its history, Soyuzmultfilm collaborated on a number of various projects with film and animation studios of Europe and Asia. In 1981, the musical feature film &quot;Maria, Mirabela&quot;, in which Lev Milchin and Victor Dudkin appeared as production designers, was released together with the Romanian studio Casa de Filme 5 and Moldova-Film.  

In 1987, the animated trilogy &quot;The Adventures of Lolo the Penguin&quot;, directed by Gennady Sokolsky and Kenji Yoshida, was released jointly with the Japan&#x27;s Lifework Corporation.  

Since 1989, in collaboration with S4C (UK) television channel the series of the anthology &quot;&quot;, based on the plays of William Shakespeare, began. The series was co-directed by several Russian animators – Stanislav Sokolov, {{ill|Maria Muat|ru|Муат, Мария Андреевна}}, Nikolay Serebryakov, Yefim Gamburg and {{ill|Natalia Orlova|ru|Орлова, Наталья Вячеславовна}}. The premiere took place in 1992 on BBC2. The show was highly praised by viewers and critics and won three Emmy Awards.

In the second half of the 1980s, the work of the studio was reorganized. In 1988, five creative associations were formed within Soyuzmultfilm: Search (art director Andrei Khrzhanovsky), Comics (art director Vladimir Tarasov), Tradition (art director Anatoly Petrov), Children&#x27;s film (art director Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin), 3D stop motion (art director {{ill|Vadim Kurchevsky|ru|Курчевский, Вадим Владимирович}}), as well as the stand-alone workshop by Yuri Norstein. That lasted until 1990, when the studio&#x27;s division into Creative Production Association for stop motion and hand-drawn films was returned.

=== Post-Soviet era ===

In the early 1990s, new economic realities made it impossible for the government to support the studio any longer, and cartoon production decreased dramatically. Soyuzmultfilm was experiencing several crises at once – production and creativity, a number of talented employees left the studio. The production mechanism became impaired, there was a shortage of animators and workshop personnel, and the creative atmosphere was drying up. The studio lost its leading position in the system of Soviet film studios producing animated films. Production volumes were falling gradually. The USSR State Committee for Cinematography began to reduce the amount of funding for the studio.

In 1989–1999, Soyuzmultfilm was made into a leased enterprise – the staff members leased their own studio from the state in order to continue producing films.

In 1993–1995, the studio lost its puppet division building, which was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church.

In 1990s, Soyuzmultfilm became a production base for independent private studios as well ({{ill|Christmas Films|ru|Кристмас Филмз}}, Argus International, School-Studio SHAR, Renaissance, Studio 13, Chris, Polinkevich and others). Film production almost completely ceased.

In 1999, pursuant to the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin, a new structure was established – the Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FSUE) &quot;Soyuzmultfilm Film Studio&quot;, which was given the premises, production facilities and film rights.

In 2004, it was decided to establish the FSUE &quot;Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund&quot;, which was supposed to manage the film rights and headed by Ernest Rakhimov, and the FSUE Creative Production Association &quot;Soyuzmultfilm Film Studio&quot;, headed by Akop Kirakosyan, and which mission was to create new films.

In 2008–2009, the FSUE &quot;Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund&quot; was transformed into the &quot;United State Film Collection&quot;.

Gradually there was a technical re-equipment of the studio. Directors Sergey Kositsyn, {{ill|Natalya Dabizha|ru|Дабижа, Наталья Борисовна}}, {{ill|Aida Zyablikova|ru|Зябликова, Аида Петровна}}, Galina Shakitskaya, Natalya Ryss, {{ill|Elvira Avakyan|ru|Авакян, Эльвира Викторовна}} and others collaborated with Soyuzmultfilm.

In 2005, Stanislav Sokolov began the production of the stop motion feature film &quot;Hoffmaniada.&quot; In 2008, the post of artistic director was introduced at the studio. It was occupied by {{ill|Natalya Dabizha|ru|Дабижа, Наталья Борисовна}} (until 2010) and Stanislav Sokolov (in 2011–2013).      

== The studio today ==
In 2011, Vladimir Putin, at the meeting with animation directors, decided to abolish the &quot;United State Film Collection&quot; and transfer the films to the studio. He also promised to significantly increase funding for domestic animation and children&#x27;s cinema.

From that moment, with the support of the state represented by the Ministry of Culture, the studio got out of crisis and the revival of Soyuzmultfilm began.

From 2013 to 2016, the artistic director of the studio was {{ill|Mikhail Aldashin|ru|Алдашин, Михаил Владимирович}}.

At the time, the production was activated, many new films were made, new directors were involved in the process.

In 2015, the Experimental Youth Association was established, under the special programme &quot;Production and Training&quot;, which is designed for directors and animators who want to develop and improve their professional skills.

In 2016, the Soyuzmultfilm film studio celebrated its 80th anniversary.

As of today, Soyuzmultfilm received about 90% of the film rights to its collection.

In terms of the number of projects and the volume of created content, Soyuzmultfilm has reached the level of a major film studio and presents its projects again at international film and television markets.

In August 2021, Soyuzmultfilm was facelifted from Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FGUP) to joint stock company with 100% of shares held by Federal Agency for State Property Management (Rosimushchestvo) according to the plan of reorganization of FGUPs by the Government of Russia. In a future, 75% of share or even more will be offered for sale and the rest will be held by Rosimushchestvo on behalf of the Government of Russia.

=== New headquarters ===
In 2017, Soyuzmultfilm moved to a new building on Akademika Korolyova Street, with almost 6000 square meters of floor space. There are about 300 employees in the studio today, 250 of them are engaged in the projects production process. Up-and-coming talents work under the guidance of experienced masters of animation.

=== Top management ===
In 2017, by order of the Ministry of Culture a new collegial-advisory body – the board – was established at the studio.

Her past experience includes a position of chief executive officer of the leading Russian independent broadcasting holding CTC Media. Yuliana has several significant rewards in the Media Business category – in 2007, she was included in the ranking of the Most Influential Business Women in Russia, prepared by &quot;{{ill|Career magazine|ru|Карьера (журнал)}}&quot;, and became the winner of the annual national award Media Manager of Russia 2007 in the nomination &quot;Public Relations&quot;, in 2015, Yuliana appeared on the list of The 20 Most Powerful Women in Global TV 2015, prepared by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter.&quot;

In July, 2017, Boris Mashkovtsev became the director of the Soyuzmultfilm film studio. Before that he was heading Airplane Studio LLC, bringing with him over a decade of experience in animation production. Boris is also a member of the management board of the Russian Animated Films Association. Boris is one of the key experts in the animation industry in Russia, he is a co-author and the chief scholarly editor of &quot;A Dictionary of Modern Animation Terminology&quot; and co-author of the textbook &quot;Producing Animated Films.&quot;

Since June, 2019, Julia Osetinskaya became the general producer of the studio. She was the executive producer in Riki Group and the head of Riki Development Fund, where she developed and produced several successful new animated brands and projects of the group.

=== Art techniques ===
The studio today is equipped with the most modern facilities and presents a wide variety of animation techniques: hand-drawn animation, 2D animation, stop motion animation and the most modern 3D animation, using CGI graphics.

This entertaining and educational story promotes traditional values of loyalty, courage and self-realization, filled with the spirit of adventure, subtle humor and romance. 

=== Animated shorts ===
This is the direction that Soyuzmultfilm has been engaged in for the past 20 years, preserving the traditional school of the studio – hand-drawn animation. &quot;Original author animation is a mandatory area for development, it moves the industry forward from an artistic point of view, invents new techniques and stories&quot;, says Julia Osetinskaya. &quot;This is our workshop of ideas. Our task now is to continue to develop and maintain this course of production, and to find the most talented directors, artists and animators&quot;, made it clear Yuliana Slashcheva. &quot;This comes up with not only producing of high-quality short author films, but also with potential ideas for further use in series and feature films&quot;.

As of 2019, the studio produced more than 80 new short animated films, and keeps producing approximately 10–15 short films a year.

The shorts produced by the studio regularly participate in prestigious international festivals. Among the recent award-winning shorts are:
* &quot;Vivat Musketeers!&quot; (2019) by Anton Diakov,
* &quot;Good Heart&quot; (2018) by Evgenia Zhirkova,
* &quot;I Want to Live in the Zoo&quot; (2017) by Evgenia Golubeva, &quot;Coco&#x27;s Day&quot; (2017) by Tatyana Moshkova,
* &quot;Trunky&quot; (2017) by Ekaterina Filippova,
* &quot;About Our Astronauts&quot; (2018) by Galina Golubeva,
* &quot;The Sled (2016)&quot; by Olesya Shchukina,
* &quot;Two Trams&quot; (2016) by Svetlana Andrianova,
* &quot;Moroshka&quot; (2015) by Polina Minchenok,
* &quot;Pik Pik Pik&quot; (2015) by {{ill|Dmitry Visotsky|ru|Высоцкий, Дмитрий Юрьевич}},
* &quot;Mama Heron&quot; (2015) by {{ill|Marina Karpova|ru|Карпова, Марина Евгеньевна}}
and others.

Among the studio&#x27;s production are new programmes of the legendary compilation of animated shorts for children &quot;Happy Merry-Go-Round&quot;, first released in 1969. The collection includes unique works in gouache and sand techniques. The production of animated shorts at the studio is supervised by the masters of animation – artistic directors and creative producers {{ill|Mikhail Aldashin|ru|Алдашин, Михаил Владимирович}} and Igor Kovalyov. Both of them, in 2019, became the members of the Oscars, selected nominees and chose winners at the ceremony. In 2017, Soyuzmultfilm released the new &quot;Bicycle&quot; almanac, which was created by students of animation colleges and up-and-coming directors.

=== New start of the Golden collection ===
Soyuzmultfilm is in the process of restoring classic tapes – the cartoons are digitized, color-corrected and given a modern surround sound. The first to be digitized and shown at cinemas are the most popular cartoons among viewers: &quot;The Twelve months&quot; (1956), &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (1957), &quot;The Adventures of Buratino&quot; (1959), &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; (1973), &quot;The Mystery of the Third Planet&quot; (1981), &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot; (1984).  

According to surveys of kids, the heroes of the &quot;Golden collection&quot; are among the most popular and favorite children&#x27;s characters. The studio decided to create a continuation of these cartoons. &quot;We selected the ten most popular characters from the old collection and are ready to give a new lease of life to them. Our task is to pack the new product with respect to the continuity of the animation traditions, using a modern language and a visual range that is understandable to modern children&quot;, Yuliana Slashcheva says. In 2018, Soyuzmultfilm announced about a release of the continuation of the cult cartoons: &quot;Well, Just You Wait!&quot;, &quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot;, &quot;Umka&quot;, &quot;The Bremen Town Musicians&quot;, &quot;Cheburashka&quot; and some others. In 2020, the second re-release of the Golden Collection commenced on 19 December 2020. The High Definition film restoration materials for the films were released. The film stock were renewed with all the film grain and extra flickering dots removed ensuring the stability of the films for the foreseeable future. Distributed by United Network &quot;Cinema Park&quot;, the HD version of the classics are screened in many of the major cities in Russia.

== Films by Jove controversy ==
In 1992, the studio signed a deal with the American company Films by Jove, owned by Russian immigrant actor Oleg Vidov and his American wife Joan Borsten. It was the first international offer that the studio had received. The deal stipulated that Films by Jove would be granted the rights to 547 of the most popular classic studio films for a period of 10 years in all territories except the CIS; as part of the return, Soyuzmultfilm would receive 37% of the net profits. Films by Jove restored many of the films and released many of them on television, video and DVD in the United States and Europe, albeit usually with dubbed voices (in the case of the series &quot;Mikhail Baryshnakov&#x27;s Stories from my Childhood&quot; having celebrity actors dubbing some characters in the films featured in the series) and changed music.

According to current director Akop Kirakosyan, the original deal seemed promising at the time but turned out to be &quot;deadly&quot; for the studio. The expected payouts never materialized because Films by Jove never posted any net profits; all of the money officially went to things such as new soundtracks, lawsuits and copy protection measures.

Whether either deal was legal was debated in court, with the Soyuzmultfilm Film Fund (see section below) claiming that because the company&#x27;s lease on its possessions would have expired in 1999 (at which time ownership would have automatically reverted to the government if no new lease were signed), Soyuzmultfilm had no authority to issue rights that lasted beyond that timeframe. Joan Borsten presented a different story. In the end, the Russian courts sided with Soyuzmultfilm and the American courts sided with Films by Jove.

U.S. Federal Court found that the Russian government has twice tried to invalidate Judge Trager&#x27;s August 2001 summary judgment decision in favor of Films By Jove and transfer the copyrights to a library of 1,500 animated films, which Films by Jove licensed from Soyuzmultfilm Studios in 1992 to a new state-owned company. The judge found evidence of &quot;continued actions being taken by the Russian government and judiciary to influence the outcome of this United States litigation with the purpose of depriving plaintiff Films by Jove of its right to distribute the animated films in the United States and elsewhere outside the former Soviet Union.&quot; The voluminous and very thorough decision further noted that, &quot;In the case at bar, expropriation of the property of an American company by an act of a foreign sovereign is unquestionably against the public policy of the United States.&quot;

On 11 April 2007, Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov announced that he was in the final stages of negotiating a price with Films by Jove to buy back the collection. A source close to Usmanov said that Films by Jove&#x27;s initial price was $10 million, while Usmanov is willing to pay &quot;several times less&quot;, as he considers that the rights already belong to Soyuzmultfilm and that he himself is only buying the physical film prints. In September 2007, the deal was finalized, and Usmanov handed everything over to Russian state children&#x27;s TV channel Bibigon.

<text>Back is a small lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. It lies on the northwest edge of the Mare Smythii, and the northeast rim is adjacent to the crater Schubert. To the west is Jenkins, and to the southwest is the Weierstrass–Van Vleck crater pair.

Back is nearly circular, with narrow, sharp-edged outer walls that are not significantly worn. Despite its relatively small size, Back has a central peak typical of larger craters.

Back was formally named by the IAU in 1976. It was previously known as Schubert B.

<text>RTÉ News and Current Affairs (), also known simply as RTÉ News (&quot;Nuacht RTÉ&quot;), is the national news service provided by Irish public broadcaster (RTÉ). Its services include local, national, European and international news, investigative journalism and current affairs programming for RTÉ television, radio, online, podcasts, on-demand and for independent Irish language public broadcaster TG4. It is the largest and most popular news source in Ireland – with 77% of the Irish public regarding it as their main source of Irish and international news. It broadcasts in English, Irish and Irish Sign Language. The organisation is also a source of commentary on current affairs. The division is based at the RTÉ Television Centre in Donnybrook, Dublin; however, the station also operates regional bureaux across Ireland and the world.

==History==
===Early history===
On 1 January 1926, 2RN, Ireland&#x27;s first radio station, began broadcasting. Its first advertised news bulletin was put out on 24 May 1926. Nine months later, on 26 February 1927, the station broadcast its first daily news report.

During the Second World War, referred to in Ireland as The Emergency, media censorship of radio broadcasts (under the provisions of the Emergency Powers Act 1939) affected news bulletins. Before any news bulletin was broadcast, the script of the bulletin was read over the phone to the Head of the Government Information Bureau, Frank Gallagher. Censorship under the Act was lifted on 11 May 1945.

===1960s===
On 31 December 1961 Ireland&#x27;s first national television station, Telefís Éireann, was officially launched. A new Television Complex was built at Donnybrook in Dublin and the news service was the first to move in. Charles Mitchel read the first television news bulletin at 18:00 on 1 January 1962. Andy O&#x27;Mahony was the station&#x27;s other chief newsreader in the early days of the new service. The new studios were still being completed, so construction work was heard during news bulletins. Later, on Telefís Éireann&#x27;s first full day of broadcasting, &quot;Broadsheet&quot; made its debut. This programme provided a more detailed analysis of topical matters and current affairs. There was a mixture of incisive and light-hearted items, unscripted studio interviews and filmed reports. Presented by John O&#x27;Donoghue, Brian Cleeve and Brian Farrell, some of these men would continue broadcasting with the station until the new century. Telefís Éireann&#x27;s first full day also saw the first broadcast of the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, a half-hour bulletin including news, news view, weather, and sports results.

&quot;Broadsheet&quot; was broadcast for the last time in 1964. It was replaced by Frank Hall&#x27;s &quot;Newsbeat&quot;, a news and current affairs programme that focused more on the light-hearted stories from around the country.

In 1966 Maurice O&#x27;Doherty joined the newsroom as a newsreader. Later that same year the station&#x27;s new flagship news programme was broadcast for the first time. &quot;Seven Days&quot; had a production team with people such as Eoghan Harris, Brian Cleeve, Brian Farrell, and John O&#x27;Donoghue. In 1967 the programme merged with another, &quot;Division&quot;, and became &quot;7 days&quot;.

The news was under the Telefís Éireann&#x27;s (TÉ) news department, while public affairs came under TÉ&#x27;s programming department. In the mid-1960s three public affairs programmes emerged. &quot;Home Truths&quot;, a series to help people with consumer issues, &quot;7 Days&quot;, a series that looked a political policy, and &quot;Division&quot;, a series of debates between government and opposition party leaders. Each would come under pressures due to various different groups, including government ministers.

&quot;Home Truths&quot; was successful in bring ordinary issues to the fore, in one instance a programme exposing meat prices caused butchers and the meat industry to protest the new TV service, this in turn caused issues for the advertising sales department who were having to deal with boycotts or changes to their advertising schedule, this in turn caused problems for producers who felt force to take on more softer issues due to TÉ&#x27;s commercial concerns.

&quot;Division&quot; was produced to replace &quot;Party Political Broadcasts&quot;. It had been agreed with the main parties that TÉ would invite different politicians to discuss various issues, however even from the outset TÉ had to get the permission of the party&#x27;s Chief Whip before allowing any local or national politician on to debate. However, when TÉ invited a Farming Representative into a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip refused, stating that the agreement was &quot;for politicians only&quot;.

Meanwhile, when TÉ attempted to send reporters to Vietnam for &quot;7 Days&quot; they were advised by the Government that this was unnecessary; this view was taken due to Ireland&#x27;s relationship with the United States. By the end of the 1960s, &quot;Home Truths&quot; and &quot;Division&quot; had been subsumed into &quot;7days&quot;, while &quot;7days&quot; was brought under the control of the News Division.

===1970s and 1980s===

When Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann merged, RTÉ News was expanded, providing coverage to new stations RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta and RTÉ Radio 2.

In the 1970s, News moved from the original black and white picture format to colour television.

In the early 1980s, in the space of two years, there were three general elections. This demanded a larger schedule of current affairs. New programmes &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; and &quot;Today Tonight&quot; were launched.

The current set of TV News programmes began in 1988, as RTÉ re-aligned their programmes. Seán Duignan and Eileen Dunne were the first presenters of &quot;Six One&quot;, which began in October 1988

===1990s and 2000s===
In 1991, RTÉ News appointed its first legal affairs correspondent, Kieron Wood. Also in the 1990s, the first Washington, D.C. correspondent Mark Little was appointed, and Teilifís na Gaeilge, RTÉ lyric fm and RTÉ.ie were established. In 1992 RTÉ launched its flagship current affairs programme &quot;Prime Time&quot; replacing &quot;Today Tonight&quot;. Other notable current affairs programmes from the 1990s include &quot;The Week in Politics&quot; and &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot;. Ed Mulhall became managing editor in the Newsroom Division in 1994 and was appointed managing director of RTÉ News and Current Affairs in 1997.

Much of RTÉ&#x27;s News output remained the same throughout the start of the 21st century. In 2003 RTÉ&#x27;s news department was merged with its Current Affairs department to form &quot;RTÉ News and Current Affairs&quot;. Also in September 2003, all RTÉ news reports in English on all networks were rebranded as RTÉ News, ending the separate branding of &quot;News 2&quot; and &quot;2FM News&quot;. In December 2008, RTÉ News moved out of their usual studio 3 in the Television Centre at Donnybrook and moved into a temporary studio while work was carried out in studio 3 for the relaunch. The new look was unveiled on the &quot;One O&#x27;Clock&quot; news programme on Monday 9 February 2009. Due to RTÉ cutbacks, instead of using satellite, reporters on foreign assignments were asked to send reports by internet link. RTÉ&#x27;s Beijing bureau was closed in June 2009. 2009 brought major changes the current affairs schedule with the axing of the long-running &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; which was replaced by &quot;The Frontline&quot;.

===2010s and 2020s===
The 2010s opened with what has since been commemorated as &quot;one of the most memorable moments of Irish television&quot; being shown on RTÉ&#x27;s televised news bulletins; amid a deep freeze on 8 January 2010, RTÉ showed one male individual slipping and sliding down the street in Dublin.

On 3 April 2012, it was announced that Ed Mulhall had quit RTÉ News and Current Affairs.

On 24 October 2012, RTÉ News &amp; Current Affairs announced some major changes to its output from 2013. &quot;Prime Time&quot; relaunched with a larger studio and additional presenters Claire Byrne and George Lee. &quot;The Frontline&quot; was also brought under the &quot;Prime Time&quot; brand with the programme now airing three times a week. In 2012, RTÉ announced it was moving some of its regional newsrooms to local Institute of Technology as a cost-saving arrangement. The affected areas are Sligo, Dundalk, Galway, Athlone and Waterford. RTÉ will retain the Cork and Limerick bureaux.

In January 2013, RTÉ launched a morning news programme, &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, which aired weekdays between 09:00–11:00 on RTÉ One and RTÉ News Now. &quot;Morning Edition&quot; was cancelled in November 2014. &quot;The Week in Politics&quot; now airs twice every Sunday premiering live at 12:00 and repeated again at its usual late-night slot. &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; relaunched in 2013 in a new studio and continues to air both on RTÉ Radio 1 and RTÉ News.

On 26 April 2014, RTÉ News got a new look for all of its news programmes across RTÉ Television, with a tweaked logo, new opening and closing titles, new graphics, new backdrop in Studio 3, and a new arrangement of the 9 February 2009 news music. The new look was unveiled at the &quot;Six One&quot; news bulletin.

On 22 September 2014, &quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot; was dropped. It was replaced by two new early evening bulletins called &quot;News Feed&quot; at 18:55 and 19:55. In January 2017 News Feed was also dropped. RTÉ2 does not provide any news service outside the children&#x27;s programme &quot;news2day&quot;.

On 12 January 2015, RTÉ dropped the Monday night edition of &quot;Prime Time&quot; replaced by &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot;.

On 27 October 2017, RTÉ launched its News Archives Collection not filled much after Christmas Eve 2020 (7 March 1985 – 31 December 1990). Plans to close the gaps on missing dates only 14 clips were filled between June 2021 and April 2022. But plans to upload film news (31 December 1961 – 6 March 1985) or (1991–1999) on videotape should be decided in late May or early June 2022 via RTÉ Archives.

In the summer of 2018, RTÉ announced their plan to refurbish and overhaul their news output in early 2019. RTÉ confirmed that they would be putting out to tender a contract worth close to €1.7 million to refurbish and renovate their news studio &quot;Studio 3&quot; at RTÉ Television Centre in Dublin. The overhaul would see the studio being redesigned, with a smaller news desk area and a larger second presentation area, along with new lighting, graphics, music, and presentation.

On 15 December 2018, RTÉ News moved out of Studio 3 into a temporary studio (Studio 2) at the television centre. Work then commenced on refurbishing and overhauling Studio 3.

The refurbished Studio 3 of RTÉ was relaunched on 28 January 2019. Jon Williams, RTÉ News &amp; Current Affairs Managing Director, said: &quot;The new studio and design builds on the themes that have made RTÉ Ireland&#x27;s number one choice for TV News – bringing our audiences stories from across the world and around the corner. I&#x27;m particularly thrilled that &quot;O&#x27;Donnell Abú&quot; will again herald the news of the day – and grateful to the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra for their interpretation of an iconic piece of music. The star of the news is the news – and I&#x27;m delighted that the audiences to RTÉ News will reap a dividend from last year&#x27;s land sale.&quot;

On 30 May 2022, &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; was axed and canceled after seven years.

October to December 2022, it was called &quot;Monday Night Live&quot; but Upfront with Katie Hannon was the offical replacement on Monday 9 January 2025.

==Programming==

RTÉ News and Current Affairs is responsible for all the news bulletins on RTÉ One, TG4, RTÉ Radio 1, RTÉ 2fm, RTÉ lyric fm, RTÉ News, RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, and RTÉ Europe. The division also provides written news updates on RTÉ&#x27;s teletext service, Aertel, RTÉ Mobile and RTÉ.ie. General news bulletins on TV and radio are usually branded as RTÉ News.

RTÉ News faces competition from within Ireland and abroad. For local news Virgin Media News provides competition in the television sector; as do Newstalk, Today FM and 4fm in the radio sector. As Ireland is a predominantly English-speaking nation, international news channels (CNBC Europe, CNN International, EuroNews, France 24, BBC News, Sky News, etc.) compete with RTÉ with regards television news coverage of international events. Despite this competition, however, RTÉ News remains the most popular source of news in Ireland. RTÉ News and the Irish Times remain the two most trusted media outlets in Ireland.

On occasion RTÉ may also provide rolling news coverage on an important developing news story such as on 9/11, the London Bombings of 2005, the COVID-19 pandemic and events in Ireland such as the Dublin riots of 2006 and the 2023 historic visit of US President Joe Biden to Ireland. Schedules are usually interrupted on RTÉ One to provide details of breaking stories.

==Controversies==

In March 2009, RTÉ was involved in controversy over a report about the placing of naked paintings of Taoiseach Brian Cowen in two Dublin Art Galleries. Initially, the station carried a television news report that displayed the pictures and treated the topic in a humorous light. However, after complaints from within the governing Fianna Fáil party, the station aired an apology to the Taoiseach.

In May 2011, RTÉ broadcast on a &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme allegations that the Roman Catholic Priest Kevin Reynolds raped and impregnated a Kenyan teenager. A scandal ensued when the allegations were discovered to be false, which generated intensive media coverage and political debate in Ireland, resulting in a government inquiry into the broadcaster.

In November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, RTÉ apologised after several top news presenters and correspondents, including Bryan Dobson, David McCullagh, Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan, Eileen Dunne and Paul Cunningham, were photographed at a retirement party at RTÉ headquarters where social distancing was not fully observed. Taoiseach Micheál Martin described the photographs as &quot;very disappointing&quot;. A month later, a health and safety review conducted by RTÉ into the gathering found that five breaches of COVID-19 protocols occurred, with up to 40 people present at the time.

<text>Santa Sangre () is a 1989 avant-garde surrealistic psychological horror film directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky and written by Jodorowsky along with Claudio Argento and Roberto Leoni. It stars Axel Jodorowsky, Adán Jodorowsky, Teo Jodorowsky, Blanca Guerra, Thelma Tixou, and Guy Stockwell. An international co-production of Mexico and Italy, the film is set in Mexico, and tells the story of Fenix, a boy who grew up in a circus and his struggle with childhood trauma. It is included in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.

==Plot==
The film starts with a naked figure sitting in a tree in a mental asylum. Nurses come out to him, to try to coax him off of his perch, using a plate of raw fish to persuade him to come down. As the nurses get him to put on some overalls, it is shown that he has a tattoo of a phoenix on his chest.

Years ago, Fenix spends his time performing as a &quot;child magician&quot; in a circus run by his father Orgo, the knife-thrower, and his mother Concha, a trapeze artist and aerialist. The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo&#x27;s knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a deaf mute mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix is close to), Fenix&#x27;s dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and an elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.

Concha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers as its patron saint a girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the landowner, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic Monsignor arrives to attempt to resolve the conflict, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it sacrilege and angrily leaves in disgust, so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she discovers Orgo&#x27;s affair, but Orgo, being also a hypnotist, puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.

The circus elephant dies, much to Fenix&#x27;s grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the meat. Orgo chides Fenix for crying &quot;like a little girl&quot; and tattoos a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.

Later on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of sulphuric acid onto Orgo&#x27;s genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated). He then walks into the street and slits his own throat. Fenix witnesses this, locked inside a trailer. He then sees the tattooed woman drive off with Alma.

Back in the present, Fenix is taken on a trip out of the asylum to a movie theater along with other patients, most of whom have Down syndrome. A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute. Fenix then spots the tattooed woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes consumed with rage. Back in the asylum, Fenix&#x27;s armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window. The tattooed woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma, who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck. The tattooed woman is then killed by the hands of an unseen assailant.

Fenix and Concha go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha&#x27;s arms. But Concha soon starts to use her son&#x27;s hands to kill women whom Fenix is interested in, including a young performer and a transexual wrestler. A dream sequence subsequently shows that Fenix has killed many more women, all of whom haunt him.

Alma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha&#x27;s stomach. She vanishes, but not before taunting Fenix by saying she will always be inside of him. Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha in fact died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.

Alma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. Fenix&#x27;s realization that he has finally regained control of his hands brings him joy and peace.

Roberto Leoni, who had worked in the library of a psychiatric hospital where he had been in contact with people suffering from mental disorders, developed a story about dissociative identity disorder that he told Claudio Argento during a time they worked together. Argento appreciated the story and added to it, and with Leoni, they decided to present it to the director who seemed to them the most suited to the material, Alejandro Jodorowsky. 
After his cult film &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; of 1974, Jodorowsky was asked to direct a film version of Frank Herbert’s epic 1965 science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; but the project had collapsed, and except for the children’s fable &quot;Tusk&quot; in 1980 he had stopped directing films, working as a comics writer in France.

Jodorowsky developed this story, also telling Leoni the story of Gregorio Cárdenas Hernández, which were in some respects similar, and together they wrote the script of &quot;Santa Sangre&quot;.

=== Writing ===
Roberto Leoni stated that an episode with a patient in the psychiatric hospital was probably the origin of &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; because over time he conceived &quot;a story in which even the worst demon actually can&#x27;t forget he is an angel.&quot; In fact, Fenix the character that Leoni created together with Jodorowsky is a serial killer, but &quot;…every time he kills you feel sorry for him, that is you are sorry more for him than for the victim.&quot;

== Release ==
Though a Mexican and Italian co-production, &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; is in English.
In the United States, it was primarily rated NC-17 for &quot;several scenes of extremely explicit violence&quot;. An edited version was released with an R rating for &quot;bizarre, graphic violence and sensuality, and for drug content&quot;. Regardless, &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; did not receive a wide release in the U.S., only screening at a few theaters familiar with Jodorowsky&#x27;s previous work.

In 2004 Anchor Bay released a DVD in the UK. On 25 January 2011, Severin Films gave the film a release on both DVD and Blu-ray with more than &quot;five hours of exclusive extras&quot;. On Halloween 2019, Mórbido Fest held a celebratory 30th anniversary screening of &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; remastered in 4K by Severin Films from a scan of the original camera negative. In Italy, from 25 to 27 November 2019, the Videa film society celebrated the 30th anniversary by screening the 4K restored version at select theatres.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film generally was critically well received, eventually being ranked 476th on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.
A reviewer from the British Film 4 describing the film as &quot;one of Jodorowsky&#x27;s finest films&quot; which &quot;resonates with all the disturbing power of a clammy nightmare filtered through the hallucinatory lens of 1960s psychedelia.&quot;

Roger Ebert said that he believed it carried the moral message of genuinely opposing evil, rather than celebrating it like most contemporary horror films. Ebert described it as &quot;a horror film, one of the greatest, and after waiting patiently through countless Dead Teenager Movies, I am reminded by Alejandro Jodorowsky that true psychic horror is possible on the screen – horror, poetry, surrealism, psychological pain, and wicked humor, all at once.&quot;

, the film had an 87% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 46 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus stated: &quot;Those unfamiliar with Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s style may find it overwhelming, but &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; is a provocative psychedelic journey featuring the director&#x27;s signature touches of violence, vulgarity, and an oddly personal moral center.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was screened at the V Muestra de Cine Mexicano en Guadalajara where several groups of people left the room during the screening.

&quot;Santa Sangre&quot; is considered a cult movie and the restored print of the film was screened in 2008 Cannes Classics.

It was also screened during Locarno Film Festival 2016 Histoire(s) du cinéma: Pardo d&#x27;onore Swisscom Alejandro Jodorowsky.

==Cultural references==
In 2001 filmmaker David Gregory released a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary film titled &quot;Forget Everything You Have Ever Seen: The World of Santa Sangre.&quot; It features interviews with members of the cast and crew.

<text>Harlan Mathews (January 17, 1927 – May 9, 2014) was an American politician who was an appointed interim Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1993 to 1994. He previously served in the executive and legislative branches of state government in Tennessee for more than 40 years beginning in 1950.

==Early life and education==
Harlan Mathews was born January 17, 1927, in Sumiton, Alabama, the son of John William Mathews and Lillian (Young) Mathews. In 1944, after high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served until 1946. Returning to Alabama, he graduated from Jacksonville State College (now Jacksonville State University) with a B.A. degree in 1949.

After graduating, Mathews obtained a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Vanderbilt University in 1950. He began work on Governor Gordon Browning&#x27;s planning staff. When Frank G. Clement was elected governor in 1954, Mathews moved to the state&#x27;s budget staff. A year after beginning his service as commissioner of finance and administration in 1961, he completed his law degree in 1962 from the YMCA Night Law School, now Nashville School of Law.

==Early political career==
Mathews joined the staff of the governor of Tennessee in 1950, serving governors Gordon Browning, Frank G. Clement and Buford Ellington. From 1961-1971 he served as commissioner of finance and administration.

In January 1971, Mathews left the cabinet and entered the private sector for two years, working for Amcon International in Memphis. In 1973, he became the legislative assistant to longtime Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Bill Snodgrass. In 1974, Mathews was elected state treasurer by the Tennessee General Assembly after his predecessor, Tom Wiseman, resigned to run for governor. The Tennessee General Assembly elected Mathews to his first full two-year term as treasurer in 1975, where he served until January 1987, when he became deputy to Governor Ned R. McWherter.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1993, Tennessee Governor Ned McWherter appointed Mathews to the U.S. Senate following the resignation of Al Gore, who resigned to serve as Vice President of the United States. Upon appointing Mathews to the senate, McWherter announced Mathews’ role would be one of caretaker, to allow those who wanted to run for the position to prepare their campaigns.

In mid-1993, Mathews expressed a desire to run in November 1994 for election to the remainder of Gore&#x27;s senate term. &quot;Hardly a day goes by that I don&#x27;t get encouraged to get in there and offer myself&quot; for next year&#x27;s election, he said in July 1993. Mathews ultimately decided not to run in the special election and in December 1994, after Fred Thompson was elected to the seat, Mathews left office and resumed a law practice in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Death==
Mathews died of brain cancer on May 9, 2014, at a hospice in Nashville. He was survived by his wife, Pat, and two sons. A third son, Richard Mathews, preceded him in death.

<doc id="1064543" wikidata="Q380071" url="?curid=1064543" title="Vukašin of Serbia">
<text>Vukašin Mrnjavčević (, ; c. 1320 – 26 September 1371) was King of Serbia as the co-ruler of Stefan Uroš V from 1365 to 1371. He was also a nobleman. Principal domains of Vukašin and his family were located in southern parts of medieval Serbia and northwestern parts of the modern region of Macedonia. He died in the Battle of Maritsa in 1371 with his brother, Jovan Uglješa.

In folk tradition, Vukašin is referred to as a usurper and, wrongly, the murderer of Tsar Uroš. He was often considered d&quot;e facto&quot; ruler of Serbian Empire during the reign of Uroš.

==Background==
According to 17th-century Ragusan historian Mavro Orbini, his father was a minor noble named Mrnjava from Zachlumia, whose sons Vukašin and Uglješa Mrnjavčević were born in Livno in western Bosnia. Some of Orbin&#x27;s historical accounts are based on oral traditions of his time, but a 1280 Ragusan document mentions a Mrnjan as a nobleman from Trebinje, a town in Travunia in the vicinity of Zachlumia. The same Mrnjan is mentioned again in a 1289 charter as a treasurer of the Serbian queen Helen of Anjou. After Zachlumia was annexed by Bosnia in 1326, the family of Mrnjan, or Mrnjava, could have moved to Livno. Possibly the family supported Serbian Emperor Dušan&#x27;s invasion of Bosnia in 1350, as did other Zachlumian nobles, and fearing punishment, emigrated to Serbia when the war was about to start. In favor of Zachumlian or Travunian origin of Vukašin also speaks the inscription on the tomb in a church in Ohrid, where certain Ostoja Rajaković of the Ugarčić clan (died 1379) is referred to as a cousin of Vukašin&#x27;s eldest son Marko. The Ugarčić clan is attested in contemporary sources as inhabiting the region of Trebinje.

After Serbia had expanded southwards into Macedonia, the local feudal lords—Greeks—were replaced with Serbs, many of whom were from Zachlumia and Travunia. Around 1350 Emperor Dušan appointed Vukašin the župan (district governor) of Prilep in Macedonia. From then on Vukašin rapidly rose, and was one of the most dominant Serbian nobles at the time of the sudden death of Dušan in 1355. He was given the title of despot by Dušan&#x27;s successor Emperor Stefan Uroš V. In 1365 he was crowned King of the Serbs and Greeks as the co-ruler of Emperor Uroš. He ruled over an area which included Prizren, Skopje and Prilep, and had good relations with his brother, Despot Jovan Uglješa who ruled an area around Ser. Later he became strong enough to disobey Uroš. By 1369, as Uroš was childless, Vukašin designated his eldest son Prince Marko as heir to the throne, with the title of &quot;young king&quot;.

In 1370 he contributed to the monasteries of Mount Athos and prepared a war against the Ottoman Empire, which his brother supported. Vukašin was to attack Trebinje in June 1371 but it was never carried out. In September 1371, he established a coalition with his brother against the Ottomans and advanced. The Serbian army of the coalition numbering ca. 70,000 men met the Ottoman army led by beylerbey of Rumeli Lala Şâhin Paşa at the Battle of Maritsa on 26 September 1371 where superior Ottoman tactics won over, outnumbering the coalition army. The Ottomans attacked the Serbian Army while they rested and Vukašin&#x27;s forces were routed and himself killed during the battle.

==Family==
With his wife Alena (Old Cyrillic: Алѣна), Vukašin had at least five children:
* Marko Mrnjavčević
* Andrijaš Mrnjavčević
* Dmitar Mrnjavčević
* Ivaniš Mrnjavčević
* Olivera Mrnjavčević
** Jelisanta
*** Jelena, married to Rajko Moneta

==In popular culture==
Brian Aldiss - published an alternative-history fantasy story &quot;The Day Of The Doomed King&quot; about King Vukašin.

<text>A quenelle () is a mixture of creamed fish or meat, sometimes combined with breadcrumbs, with a light egg binding, formed into an egg-like shape, and then cooked. The usual preparation is by poaching. Formerly, quenelles were often used as a garnish in haute cuisine. Today, they are more commonly served sauced as a dish in their own right. Similar items are found in many cuisines.

By extension, a quenelle may also be another food made into a similar shape, such as ice cream, sorbet, butter, or mashed potato quenelles.

== Etymology ==

The word quenelle is attested from 1750. The commonly accepted etymology is that it derives from the German &quot;Knödel&quot; (noodle or dumpling).

==&quot;Quenelles de brochet&quot;==
Lyon and Nantua are famous for their &quot;quenelles de brochet&quot; (pike quenelles), often served with sauce Nantua (crayfish sauce) or &quot;sauce mousseline&quot; (cream sauce) and run under a grill. The classic dish of &quot;quenelles de brochet Nantua&quot; or simply &quot;quenelles Nantua&quot; consists of pike quenelles with sauce Nantua, both pike and crayfish being specialties of the Nantua area. Pike quenelles were invented by a chef named Bontemps to deal with the pike&#x27;s &quot;multitude of long, fine, forked bones&quot;.

&quot;Quenelles de brochet&quot; are prepared in many ways, but most recipes first prepare a panade, essentially a thick white sauce, then combine the panade with fish, and put the mixture through a sieve such as a tamis, yielding a forcemeat. The quenelles are shaped from the forcemeat and then poached. They may be served sauced and grilled, or with a variety of sauces.

<doc id="1064581" wikidata="Q336473" url="?curid=1064581" title="Aid agency">
<text>An aid agency, also known as development charity, is an organization dedicated to distributing aid. Many professional aid organisations exist, both within government, between governments as multilateral donors and as private voluntary organizations or non-governmental organisations. The International Committee of the Red Cross is the world&#x27;s second-oldest humanitarian organisation and is unique in being mandated by international treaty to uphold the Geneva Conventions. The Sovereign Order of Malta, established in 1099 as the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, has an unbroken tradition of over 900 years of hospitaller activities, continuing to this day. Even in its modern guise under international law, it was recognized at the Congress of Verona of 1822, and since 1834 headquartered in Palazzo Malta in Rome, decades before the Red Cross.

Aid can be subdivided into two categories: humanitarian aid (emergency relief efforts, e.g. in response to natural disasters), and development aid (or foreign aid), aimed at helping countries to achieve long-term sustainable economic growth, with the aim of achieving poverty reduction. Some aid agencies carry out both kinds of aid, whilst others specialise on one aspect.

With a lack of oversight within the
Charity realm, there are 
Non-development assistance committees, and development assistance committees. Within the last few decades DACs have been the main character in the research on the charity&#x27;s effectiveness. Through vigorous study we will be looking into both forms of charity and there effectiveness based on five factors.( transparency, overhead costs, aid specialization, selective allocation, and effective delivery channels) to see which form of the committee is most effective. (Dreher &amp; Fuchs, 2015;) explain that both companies apply most aid to their country of origin. Although DAC agencies have more refined and easy obtain records showing their reporting and the lowest overhead costs, they engage in much worse effective aid practices in the remaining four factors.( Brech &amp; Potrafke, 2014; Dreher et al., 2009; Fleck &amp; Kilby, 2010; Frot et al., 2014; Fuchs et al., 2014; Kuziemko &amp; Werker, 2006; Maizels &amp; Nissanke, 1984; Neumayer, 2003). All in all, both DAC and Non-DAC have flaws; neither is clean from government pressure and lobbyist money ( Roodman (2004), Knack (2001). With further research on donor failure when it comes to meeting YoY standards we can find whether or not donors give because of self-interest

<text>The Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (, PSUC) was a communist political party active in Catalonia between 1936 and 1997. It was the Catalan branch of the Communist Party of Spain and the only party not from a sovereign state to be a full member of the Third International.

==History==

The PSUC was formed on 23 July 1936 through the unification of four left-wing groups; the small Catalan Federation of Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), the Partit Comunista de Catalunya (Communist Party of Catalonia, the Catalan branch of the Communist Party of Spain, PCE), the Unió Socialista de Catalunya (&quot;Socialist Union of Catalonia&quot;) and the Partit Català Proletari (&quot;Proletarian Catalan Party.&quot; a Catalan separatist far left party). Burnett Bolloten estimates that at unification, the party numbered some 2,500 members. Nine months later, the party ranks had swollen to 50,000 members.

The first leaders of the PSUC were Joan Comorera and Rafael Vidiella, both from the ranks of socialism. Comorera, a former USC leader, was elected general secretary of the new party, and Miquel Valdés, of the PCC, became secretary of the organization. Other leaders or prominent people of the PSUC came from the old PCC, as was the case of Víctor Colomer, Pere Ardiaca, José del Barrio Navarro, Antonio Sesé or Hilari Arlandis. Vidiella, Sesé or Del Barrio also came from the UGT workers union (del Barrio was secretary of the UGT in Catalonia) and a long time ago they had been members of the CNT.

The PSUC played a major role during the days of the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War, and was the only non-state party affiliated to the Comintern. The PCE did not organize in Catalonia, but saw PSUC as its Catalan referent. This setup has been replicated by other Catalan communist groups. The setup is somewhat similar to the relation between the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and Christian Social Union of Bavaria. The PSUC defended the self-determination of Catalonia in accordance with Lenin&#x27;s defense of the right of nations to self-determination, but not an explicit independentist position.

During the war, the Party took part in the fight against fascism following the slogan of anti-fascist unity, and after the initial veto of the CNT, it participated in the government of the Generalitat de Catalunya with several ministries. It had a conflicting relationship with the large National Confederation of Labour (CNT) and the small rival Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM).

At the beginning of the war the PSUC came to organize the &quot;Carles Marx&quot; Column, formed by militants from both the party and the UGT union and under the leadership of Del Barrio and Trueba, who went to the Front of Aragon in the early days of the struggle. Later this militia would serve as a base for the formation of the 27.ª Division of the Republican Army, a unit that had a prominent intervention in several military operations. In the rear, the JSUC (youth branch) led by Lina Odena and Margarida Abril played an important role in carrying out numerous tasks for the war effort, or also in recruiting volunteers for the Republican Army.

Allied with the government of Companys, of Catalan Republican Left (ERC), it faced the POUM and the initial dominion of the CNT, in a permanent political confrontation which ended with the events of May 1937, that marked the end of the stage of greater anarcho-syndicalist dominion in Catalonia.

PSUC members held positions of &quot;conseller&quot; (minister) in the governments of Lluís Companys between 1936 and 1939: Joan Comorera, as Minister of Public Services, Miquel Valdés as Minister of Labor, Rafael Vidiella as minister of Justice, Miquel Serra i Pàmies and Josep Miret i Musté &quot;conseller&quot; of supplies. Also a member of PSUC, Josep Moix i Regàs, was minister of Labor in Spanish republican government led by socialist Juan Negrin.

However, as the war progressed, the Republican cause was increasingly confronted with defeat. After the fall of Catalonia in February 1939, most of its leaders fled to France, although many of its cadres remained in Spain and suffered the repression of the Franco dictatorship.

In French exile they collaborated in the resistance against the Nazi occupation, and some of its members and leaders died in concentration camps, such as Josep Miret i Musté in Mauthausen in 1944.

In Francoist Spain, the PSUC was outlawed and remained active clandestinely in Catalonia and in exile, in France and Mexico.

Inside, they carried out a strong clandestine task that provoked strong repression. In January 1940, the first PSUC leadership was arrested underground. Alejandro Matos was killed at the police station. Otilio Alba Polo and Tomás Pons were executed. In 1942, Jaume Girabau, Isidoro Diéguez Dueñas and Jesús Larrañaga were executed after illegally arriving from Mexico and arrested at the Portuguese border.

Josep Serradell Román and Margarida Abril were more successful in 1943, while Joaquim Puig i Pidemunt republished Treball magazine and in 1944 Miquel Núñez González directed the guerrilla units of the Agrupació Guerrillera de Catalunya. In 1945, the March Resolution was agreed, the first political elaboration of the PSUC carried out in the interior where the impetus of the guerrilla struggle, the anti-fascist unity, and confidence in the victory of the allies would lead to the overthrow of the Franco&#x27;s regime.

But falls and repression were too frequent. Francesc Serrat Pujolar and Joan Arévalo Gallardo were executed in 1946, and in 1947 the so-called fall of the eighties took place. In 1948 Gregori López Raimundo arrived in Catalonia, and the party agreed to the dissolution of the guerrilla groups. In 1949, Joaquim Puig Puidemunt, Numen Mestre Ferrando, Angel Carrero Sancho and Pere Valverde were executed in Barcelona. At the same time, the relationship with the PCE, despite mutual recognition, often had frictions due to the PCE leadership&#x27;s attempts to limit the organic sovereignty of the PSUC, as a result of these frictions Joan Comorera was expelled from the PSUC accused of &#x27;titoism&#x27; and &#x27;nationalist deviations&#x27; and entered Catalonia clandestinely in 1951, where he was arrested by the Francoist authorities in 1954 and sentenced to 30 years in prison, He died in the prison of Burgos in 1958.

The leadership of the PSUC in exile would later be formed by Josep Moix, Rafael Vidiella, Wenceslau Colomer i Colomer, Josep Romeu, Margarida Abril and Pere Ardiaca. The direction inside takes strength. Gregori López Raimundo was arrested as a result of the 1951 tram strike. In 1956, the First Congress of the PSUC was held in France, where a new political and organizational starting point was proposed. 50 delegates from exile and the interior (university students and workers) take part. The policy of national reconciliation is approved. The Executive Committee is made up of: Josep Moix (Secretary General), Margarida Abril, Pere Ardiaca, Josep Bonifaci, Emilià Fàbregas, Gregori López Raimundo, Miquel Núñez, Carles Rebellón, Josep Serradell &quot;Román&quot;, Antoni Senserrich and Rafael Vidiella.

In the following years, Emili Fàbregas, Miquel Núñez González, Carles Rebellón in 1960, Vicente Cazcarra in 1961, Antoni Gutiérrez Díaz and Pere Ardiaca in 1962 were arrested and imprisoned.

Josep Sendrós and Leonor Bornau are in charge of coordinating &quot;Treball&quot; and publishing a new magazine, &quot;Horitzons&quot;. In 1965, the II Congress of the PSUC was held in France, with the participation of 90 delegates, who approved a line of impetus to the student and labor movement. Thus it collaborated in the formation of union Working Commissions (CCOO). The line proved to be successful, and laid the foundations for the growing hegemony of the party in the fight against the Franco regime in Catalonia. Its influence among intellectuals and Catalan culture also grew.

PSUC continued in the 1960s decade organizing the neighborhood movement, workers commissions, the Democratic Student Union, and other mass experiences. In 1969 it participated in the Coordination of Political Forces of Catalonia and in 1971 in the Assembly of Catalonia (Assemblea de Catalunya), where his representative was Antoni Gutierrez Díaz. In 1973, the III Congress of the PSUC was held with the participation of 200 delegates. In 1975 he took part in the Council of Political Forces of Catalonia, sending Josep Solé i Barberà and Gregori López Raimundo as representatives.

The PSUC was the largest opposition party in Catalonia and upon Spain&#x27;s transformation into a democratic state and constitutional monarchy, it became a mass party with more than 40.000 active members.

In 1977, during the Spanish transition to democracy, the PSUC was legalized after the PCE. He participated in the negotiations for the restoration of the Autonomy of Catalonia and the Statute.

In the first elections to the Parliament of Catalonia (1980) it was the third political force, with nearly 600,000 votes and 25 elected MPs.

PSUC aligned itself with the Eurocommunism of the Italian, Spanish and French Communist parties, but the rejection of much of the grassroots and some leaders led to the withdrawal of this term in the V Congress, in 1981. The party experienced a severe crisis and division. Tensions continued between the three factions, so-called Eurocommunists led by Antoni Gutierrez and Lopez Raimundo, the &#x27;Leninists&#x27; led by Paco Frutos and the &#x27;Historic&#x27; leftist prosovietic faction led by Pere Ardiaca. Under pressure from Santiago Carrillo (General Secretary of PCE) Eurocommunists and &#x27;leninists&#x27; joined forces to expel prosoviet faction, led by Pere Ardiaca who would found the PCC (Communists Party of Catalonia) in 1982 claiming legitimacy of V Congress.

After the split, the election results fell sharply, with only 160,000 votes for the PSUC and 71,000 for the PCC in the 1984 Catalan parliamentary election.

From 1986 onwards, the strong mobilizations against Spain&#x27;s accession to NATO alliance, and the NATO referendum in which Catalonia won the NO, led to a process of political convergence within the Catalan left.

Antoni Gutiérrez resigned as general secretary in 1986 and the central committee elected Rafael Ribó as his successor. The PSUC ran in coalition with the Entesa dels Nacionalistes d&#x27;Esquerra (Catalan left nationalist party) in the 1986 Spanish general election, but won only one seat. The collaboration between the PSUC and ENE was extended by the municipal elections of 1987 with the incorporation of the Partit dels Comunistes de Catalunya PCC into a federation of political parties that adopted the name of Iniciativa per Catalunya, which would be set up in 1989.

As PSUC became later involved in Iniciativa per Catalunya (IC) first, and Iniciativa per Catalunya-Els Verds, with the merger of some green and ecologist movements, it ceased acting as a separate party. When PSUC was finally submerged into ICV in 1997, a splinter group refounded the party as &quot;PSUC-viu&quot; (Living PSUC). PSUC-Viu became the new referent of PCE in Catalonia.The PSUC Viu would later form the United Left and Alternative coalition together with the PCC, and would later ally with the other heirs of the PSUC in the ICV-EUiA coalition.

They have been running together since 2003 in the elections to the Parliament of Catalonia, ICV-EUiA were part of the government of Catalonia between 2003 and 2010 in coalition with the PSC and ERC. In the Catalan governments led by presidents Pasqual Maragall and later by Josep Montilla, three former PSUC militants held the position of ministers: Francesc Baltasar, Salvador Milà and Joan Saura.

in 2015 ICV and EUIA formed a broader coalition with Podemos and Equo to form Catalunya En Comú Podem to contest the elections to the Parliament of Catalonia and En Comú Podem (ECP) to the Spanish Parliament.

In the 2015 Spanish election ECP was placed as the first force in Catalonia, with 12 seats and 927,940 votes. In the Catalan elections of 2017 the coalition obtained 8 deputies and 7.46% of votes. In the November 2019 Spanish election It fell to 4th position, with 14.2% and 7 deputies.

<text>A bigram or digram is a sequence of two adjacent elements from a string of tokens, which are typically letters, syllables, or words. A bigram is an &quot;n&quot;-gram for &quot;n&quot;=2.

The frequency distribution of every bigram in a string is commonly used for simple statistical analysis of text in many applications, including in computational linguistics, cryptography, and speech recognition.

&quot;Gappy bigrams&quot; or &quot;skipping bigrams&quot; are word pairs which allow gaps (perhaps avoiding connecting words, or allowing some simulation of dependencies, as in a dependency grammar).

==Applications==

Bigrams, along with other n-grams, are used in most successful language models for speech recognition.

Bigram frequency attacks can be used in cryptography to solve cryptograms. See frequency analysis.

Bigram frequency is one approach to statistical language identification.

Some activities in logology or recreational linguistics involve bigrams. These include attempts to find English words beginning with every possible bigram, or words containing a string of repeated bigrams, such as &quot;logogogue&quot;.

==Bigram frequency in the English language==
The frequency of the most common letter bigrams in a large English corpus is:

 th 3.56% of 1.17% io 0.83%

<text>Hiram Gilmore &quot;Harry&quot; Bates III (October 9, 1900 – September 1981) was an American science fiction editor and writer. His short story &quot;Farewell to the Master&quot; (1940) was the basis of the science fiction movie &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951).

==Biography==

Harry Bates was born Hiram Gilmore Bates III on October 9, 1900, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He began working for William Clayton in the 1920s as the editor of adventure pulp magazines. When Clayton proposed a period adventure magazine, Bates suggested several alternatives that he said would be easier to edit, and &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; was the result. Bates, who was not a fan of science fiction, edited the magazine from its inception in January 1930 until March 1933, when Clayton went bankrupt and the magazine was sold to Street and Smith. During that time, he edited other magazines for Clayton, including &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, intended to compete with &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

Bates believed the science fiction stories of the time were poorly written: &quot;&quot;Amazing Stories&quot;! Once I had bought a copy. What awful stuff I&#x27;d found it! Cluttered with trivia! Packed with puerilities. Written by unimaginables! But now at the memory I wondered if there might be a market for a well-written magazine on the &quot;Amazing&quot; themes.&quot; Bates wrote that the &quot;science fiction of the early writers had little relation to science of the scientists.&quot; What science fiction writers did was to &quot;extrapolate&quot; and not &quot;relate&quot; because &quot;almost all of what is called science fiction is fantasy and nothing else but.&quot;

In 1964, Bates recalled his editorship of &quot;Astounding&quot;: &quot;Long ago I was a party to the genesis of a magazine which persisted through thirty years and thirty millions of words. ... &quot;Astounding&quot; was a living being. I served it in its infancy and childhood, Orlin Tremaine brought it through youth and adolescence, John Campbell guided it through adulthood and maturity.&quot;

Bates had a different opinion of science fiction than Hugo Gernsback, publisher of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Bates felt that the science needed to be exciting, but not necessarily accurate, and that story and pacing were more important.

Using the pseudonyms Anthony Gilmore and H.G. Winter, Bates and his assistant editor Desmond Winter Hall collaborated on the &quot;Hawk Carse&quot; series and other stories. In 1952, the Hawk Carse stories were collected in &quot;Space Hawk: The Greatest of Interplanetary Adventurers&quot;. Bates&#x27;s most famous story is &quot;Farewell to the Master&quot; (&quot;Astounding&quot;, October 1940), which was the basis for the well-known science fiction movie of 1951, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, as well as the 2008 remake and the 1973 Marvel Comics &quot;Worlds Unknown&quot; series adaptation.

Bates recalled the creation of the Hawk Carse science fiction series in &quot;Requiem for Astounding&quot; (1964): &quot;From the beginning I had been bothered by the seeming inability of my writers to mix convincing character with our not-too-convincing science; so after nearly two years, with the double hope of furnishing the writers an example of a vivid hero villain and my readers a whopping hero villain, I generated the first Hawk Carse story.&quot;

Two novellas by Bates appeared in Gernsback&#x27;s &quot;Science-Fiction Plus&quot;, edited by Sam Moskowitz; &quot;The Death of a Sensitive&quot; (May 1953) was ranked by Moskowitz as the best story he ever published in the magazine. Both Gernsback and Moskowitz, however, wanted changes in &quot;The Triggered Dimension&quot; (December 1953), and Bates agreed to make the changes and arrived at the magazine&#x27;s offices at 25 West Broadway to do the revisions.

That same year Moskowitz began teaching what is believed to be the first college course on science fiction at City College. Bates had agreed to speak as a guest lecturer for the first class. As retaliation for the revision of his story, however, Bates intentionally did not go to the class, resulting in considerable awkwardness for Moskowitz. Moskowitz recalled later:

In 1964, Bates contributed an introductory essay, Editorial Number One, &quot;To Begin&quot;, along with John W. Campbell, to &quot;A Requiem for Astounding&quot; by Alva Rogers, which examined the history of the science fiction magazine &quot;Astounding&quot;.

Writer Avram Davidson credited Bates as an early influence, stating that &quot;I will admit to the bibliography something done when I was twelve, entitled &#x27;The Slaveship from Space&#x27;. It was modeled after a magazine story entitled, curiously enough, &#x27;The Slaveship from Space&#x27;, and I believe the imitation was fully as bad as the original—no mean feat, I can assure you.&quot;

Bates died in September, 1981, at the age of 80.

==&quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;==

In 1951, Twentieth Century Fox released the movie &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, which was based on Bates&#x27; 1940 short story &quot;Farewell to the Master&quot;. The science fiction movie featured Michael Rennie as Klaatu, Patricia Neal, Sam Jaffe, Hugh Marlowe, and Lock Martin as the giant alien robot Gort, called Gnut in Bates&#x27; short story. The movie was directed by Robert Wise and produced by Julian Blaustein. Screenwriter Edmund H. North adapted Bates&#x27; short story for the screen. The movie is rated consistently by critics as one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made.

The critical and commercial success of the 1951 movie relied on the novel themes Bates introduced in his short story. Ever since H.G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898), aliens were often described as menacing, aggressive, and murderous, with a degraded moral and ethical sense. In Bates&#x27; story, aliens are the opposite, possessing a good moral character. The alien Klaatu&#x27;s face &quot;radiated kindness, wisdom, the purest nobility. In his delicately tinted robe he looked like a benign god.&quot; The giant alien robot, Gnut in the short story, Gort in the film, is immensely powerful, but can exhibit sadness and gentleness. In the surprise ending, Gnut tells the journalist, who is relating the story, &quot;You misunderstand, ... am the master&quot;.

While &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; is inspired by Bates&#x27; short story, the 1951 context of the Cold War resulted in some changes to the story&#x27;s themes. In the movie, Klaatu seeks to promote peace and to warn mankind of the dangers of science and technology when they are exploited and corrupted. The alien explains that Gort is a member of a race of all-powerful robots who were created to eliminate any civilizations which promoted warfare in space.

During 1983, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; was inducted into the Science Fiction Film Hall of Fame as part of the Balrog Awards, which were given from 1979 to 1985.

In 2008, director Scott Derrickson remade &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. The movie starred Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu and Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Helen Benson. David Scarpa wrote the screenplay based on Edmund H. North&#x27;s 1951 screenplay.

==Hawk Carse short stories==

Under the pseudonym of Anthony Gilmore, Bates wrote the following stories in the Hawk Carse series with Desmond W. Hall, collected in &quot;Space Hawk: The Greatest of Interplanetary Adventurers&quot; (New York: Greenberg, 1952):

* &quot;Hawk Carse&quot;, &quot;Astounding&quot;, November, 1931
* &quot;The Affair of the Brains&quot;, &quot;Astounding&quot;, March, 1932
* &quot;The Bluff of the Hawk&quot;, &quot;Astounding&quot;, May, 1932
* &quot;The Passing of Ku Sui&quot;, &quot;Astounding&quot;, November, 1932

Boucher and McComas described the 1952 collection as &quot;strongly commended to all connoisseurs of prose so outrageously bad as to reach its own kind of greatness.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller described the stories as &quot;space opera of the old, raw, gloves-off school [including] every cliche of the period,&quot; concluding &quot;Hawk Carse was so bad that he was almost good.&quot; Everett F. Bleiler characterized the series as &quot;traditional pulp Western stories transplanted into space, with the addition of an Oriental villain in the mode of Sax Rohmer&#x27;s Dr. Fu-Manchu.&quot;

Ten years later, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; printed in July 1942 the final Hawk Carse novelette, &quot;The Return of Hawk Carse&quot;, written by Bates alone. This story has never been collected or reprinted.

<text>Much Marcle is a village and civil parish in Herefordshire, England, located north-east of Ross-on-Wye. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 660. The name &quot;Marcle&quot; comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for a boundary field, &quot;mearc-leah&quot;. &quot;Much&quot;, in this case, means large or great, from the Middle English usage of the word.

==Historic village==
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Much Marcle was listed as &quot;Merchelai&quot; in the hundred of Wimundestreu and contained 36 households, a large settlement following the Norman Conquest.

Hellens Manor stands in the centre of the village. In 1096, the manor was granted by King William II to Hamelin de Balun, whose family later witnessed the signing of Magna Carta. It contains period furnishings, paintings and decorations, and has a Tudor garden. The manor is open to the public and provides a venue for educational, musical and literary events.

The other principal seat is Homme House, surrounded by ancient parkland. There are also two ruined medieval castles in the parish. One is Mortimer&#x27;s Castle, also known as Much Marcle Castle. The second is Ellingham Castle which is situated at Quarry Wood.

The Church of England parish church of St Bartholomew is 13th-century with historic carvings and an ancient &#x27;hollow&#x27; yew tree thought to be at least 1500 years old. The church contains the tomb of Blanche Mortimer, of the dynasty of Marcher Lords, the Mortimers; the tomb bears the Mortimer coat of arms. She married Peter de Grandison.
The Kyrle Tomb is located in the centre of the chapel. It has effigies of Sir John Kyrle of nearby Homme House and his wife Sybil Scudamore. Sir John was born in 1568 and served as High Sheriff of the county in 1609 and 1629. He was created a baronet in 1627. Later he protested against the payment of Ship Money, and in the English Civil War he supported the Parliamentarians. He died in 1650.
Following the Second World War, a plaque listing the names of those men who lost their lives serving in the military was placed in Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Church. Many of their surnames have been known in the region for many centuries.

==The Wonder==
About north-north west of the village, on the eastern face of Marcle Ridge, a massive landslip, estimated at , took place over three days starting on 17 February 1575. Named &quot;The Wonder&quot;, it was so large that full-grown trees were carried down the slope onto an adjoining property. In his book &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot;, Gilbert White (1720–93) quotes the words of John Philips:

I nor advise, nor reprehend the choice&lt;br&gt;
Of Marcley Hill; the apple nowhere finds&lt;br&gt;
A kinder mould; yet &#x27;tis unsafe to trust&lt;br&gt;
Deceitful ground; who knows but that once more&lt;br&gt;
This mount may journey, and his present site&lt;br&gt;
Forsaken, to thy neighbour&#x27;s bounds transfer&lt;br&gt;
Thy goodly plants, affording matter strange&lt;br&gt;
For law debates!&lt;br&gt;
In Victorian times, people came from far and wide to view &quot;The Wonder&quot;. It is shown on the Ordnance Survey map at reference SO632365, but on the ground the site is not readily discernible.

==Farming traditions==
Notable local farms include the Bounds, home of Weston&#x27;s Cider and the Scrumpy House Restaurant. Other principal farms include Chandois, Street Farm, Great Moor Court, Bickerton, Gammage Ford, Caerswall, Upper Woltan, Walls End and Noggin, all of which are of ancient origin but with buildings dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. Many of the ancient cottages that appear in the 18th century maps no longer exist, although there are several good examples of &quot;black and white&quot; half-timbered buildings that have survived, especially in the village&#x27;s main street.

In 2012, Noggin Farm won the Flavours of Herefordshire &quot;Sausage of the Year.&quot;

==Modern times==

The village has a Church of England primary school located next to the church. It also has local cider and perry mills, one producing Weston&#x27;s brands. and another producing Gregg&#x27;s brands.

Much Marcle Garage is housed in a re-purposed World War One aircraft hangar, designated a Grade II listed building. The hangar, of Belfast-truss construction, came from RAF Minchinhampton in Gloucestershire.

==Notable people==
Much Marcle was the birthplace of serial killer Fred West. Three of his victims were buried there: his nanny Anna McFall and their unborn child, in 1967; and his first wife, Rena, in 1971.

<text>The Little Monocacy River is a tributary stream of the Potomac River. Despite its name, the stream does not feed into the Monocacy River. The Little Monocacy is located almost entirely in Montgomery County, Maryland, and enters the Potomac just downstream from where the Monocacy enters the Potomac. Its headwaters rise southwest of Comus, and most of its approximately watershed is farmland and pasture (60.56%) or forested land (36.03%).
