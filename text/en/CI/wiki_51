<text>Barry Mann (born Barry Imberman; February 9, 1939) is an American songwriter and musician, and was part of a successful songwriting partnership with his wife, Cynthia Weil.

He has written or co-written 53 hits in the UK and 98 in the US.

==Early life==
Mann was born &quot;Barry Imberman&quot; on February 9, 1939, to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York City, United States. He was born two days before fellow songwriter Gerry Goffin.

==Career==
His first successful song as a writer was &quot;She Say (Oom Dooby Doom)&quot;, a Top 20 chart-scoring song composed for the band The Diamonds in 1959. Mann co-wrote the song with Mike Anthony (Michael Logiudice). In 1961, Mann had his greatest success to that point with &quot;I Love How You Love Me&quot;, written with Larry Kolber and a No. 5 scoring single for the band The Paris Sisters (seven years later, Bobby Vinton&#x27;s version would reach the Top 10). The same year, Mann himself reached the Top 40 as a performer with a novelty song co-written with Gerry Goffin, &quot;Who Put the Bomp&quot;, which parodied the nonsense words of the then-popular doo-wop genre.

Despite his success as a singer, Mann chose to channel his creativity into songwriting, forming a prolific partnership with Weil, a lyricist he met while both were staff songwriters at Don Kirshner and Al Nevin&#x27;s company Aldon Music, whose offices were located in Manhattan, near the composing-and-publishing factory the Brill Building. Mann and Weil, who married in 1961, developed some songs intended to be socially conscious, with successes such as &quot;Uptown&quot; by The Crystals, &quot;We Gotta Get out of This Place&quot; by the Animals, &quot;Magic Town&quot; by The Vogues, and &quot;Kicks&quot; by Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. Mann and Weil were disturbed when &quot;Only In America&quot;, a song they had written with the team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and conceived originally for and recorded by the Drifters as a protest against racial prejudice, was re-worked by Leiber and Stoller into an uncontroversial success for Jay &amp; The Americans.

, Mann&#x27;s song catalog lists 635 songs. He has received 56 popular music, country, and Rhythm &amp; Blues awards from Broadcast Music Inc., and 46 Millionaire Awards for radio performances numbering more than one million plays. The song &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;, co-written with Weil and Phil Spector, was the most played song of the 20th century, with more than 14 million plays.

Mann has composed songs for movies, most notably &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;, co-written with Weil and James Horner, for the 1986 animated movie &quot;An American Tail&quot;. Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram performed the song as a duet during the movie&#x27;s closing credits; their version was released as a single, which scored No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and became a &quot;gold&quot;-scoring record. &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; would win two 1987 Grammy Awards, as Song of the Year and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture or Television. &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; was also nominated for a 1986 Oscar as best song, but lost to &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; from &quot;Top Gun&quot; (a film that featured the Weil-penned &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; in a key scene). Mann&#x27;s other movie work includes the scores for &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; and &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;, and songs for &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; and &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;.

Mann co-wrote, with Dan Hill, the song &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;, which scored No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1987, Mann and Weil were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2011, they received the Johnny Mercer Award, the greatest honor from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Mann and Weil were named among the 2010 recipients of Ahmet Ertegun Award from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mann and Weil operated a publishing company named Dyad Music.

==Personal life==
Mann was married to Cynthia Weil from 1961 until her death in 2023. They had one daughter, Jenn. They resided in Beverly Hills, California.

<doc id="1060656" wikidata="Q726293" url="?curid=1060656" title="Redvers Buller">
<text>General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, (7 December 1839 – 2 June 1908) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He served as Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in South Africa during the early months of the Second Boer War and subsequently commanded the army in Natal until his return to England in November 1900.

==Origins==

Buller was the second son and eventual heir of James Wentworth Buller (1798–1865), MP for Exeter, by his wife Charlotte Juliana Jane Howard-Molyneux-Howard (d.1855), third daughter of Lord Henry Thomas Howard-Molyneux-Howard, Deputy Earl Marshal and younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. Redvers Buller was born on 7 December 1839 at the family estate of Downes, near Crediton in Devon, inherited by his great-grandfather James Buller (1740–1772) from his mother Elizabeth Gould, the wife of James Buller (1717–1765), MP.

The Bullers were an old Cornish family, long seated at Morval in Cornwall until their removal to Downes. The family estates, including Downes, inherited in 1874 by Redvers Buller from his unmarried elder brother James Howard Buller (1835–1874) included of Devon and of Cornwall, which in 1876 produced an income of £14,137 a year.

==Early career==
After education at Eton, he purchased a commission in the 60th Rifles in May 1858. He served in the Second Opium War and was promoted captain before taking part in the Canadian Red River Expedition of 1870. In 1873–74, he was the intelligence officer under Lord Wolseley during the Ashanti campaign, during which he was slightly wounded at the Battle of Ordabai. He was promoted to major and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

==Zulu War and Victoria Cross==
He then served in South Africa during the 9th Cape Frontier War in 1878 and the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. In the Zulu War he commanded the mounted infantry of the northern British column (No. 4 column) under Sir Evelyn Wood. In March 1879 the column met defeat at the Battle of Hlobane. Buller was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery during this battle.

The following day he participated in the British victory at the Battle of Kambula. After the Zulu attacks on the British position were beaten off, he led his mounted troops in a ruthless pursuit of fleeing Zulu fighters. In June 1879, he again commanded mounted troops at the Battle of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. This decisive British victory effectively ended the war.

His VC citation, for actions taken during the Battle of Hlobane, reads:

In an interview to &quot;The Register&quot; newspaper of Adelaide, South Australia, dated 2 June 1917, Trooper George Ashby of the Frontier Light Horse (also referred to as &quot;Pulleine&#x27;s Pets&quot;) attached to the 24th Regiment gave an account of his rescue by Col. Buller:

==First Boer War, Sudan and Ireland==
In the First Boer War of 1881 he was Sir Evelyn Wood&#x27;s chief of staff and the following year was again head of intelligence, this time in the Egypt campaign, and was knighted.

He had married Audrey, the daughter of the 4th Marquess Townshend, in 1882 and in the same year was sent to the Sudan in command of an infantry brigade and fought at the battles of El Teb and Tamai, and the expedition to relieve General Gordon in 1885. He was promoted to major-general. He was sent to Ireland in 1886, to head an inquiry into moonlighting by police personnel. He returned to the Army as Quartermaster-General to the Forces the following year and in 1890 promoted to Adjutant-General to the Forces, becoming a Lieutenant general on 1 April 1891. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st (Exeter and South Devon) Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment, on 4 May 1892. Although expected to be made Commander-in-Chief of the British Army by Lord Rosebery&#x27;s government on the retirement of the Duke of Cambridge in 1895, this did not happen because the government was replaced and Lord Wolseley was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army instead. On 24 June 1896 Buller was promoted to full General.

==Second Boer War and sacking==
Buller became head of the troops stationed at Aldershot in 1898. He was sent as commander of the Natal Field Force in 1899 on the outbreak of the Second Boer War. On seeing the list of troops which would make up his Corps Buller is said to have remarked &quot;well, if I can&#x27;t win with these, I ought to be kicked.&quot; By early September 1899 he had serious thoughts that the Boers could not easily be browbeaten, and that White&#x27;s forces in Natal might receive some punishment if they deployed too far forward. He arrived at the end of October. He was defeated at the Battle of Colenso, during what was later to become known as Black Week. Defeats at the Battle of Magersfontein and Battle of Stormberg also involved forces under his command. Because of concerns about his performance and negative reports from the field he was replaced in January 1900 as overall commander in South Africa by Lord Roberts. Defeats and questionable ability as commander soon earned him the nickname &quot;Reverse Buller&quot; among troops. He remained as second-in-command and suffered two more setbacks in his attempts to relieve Ladysmith at the battles of Spion Kop and Vaal Krantz. On his fourth attempt, Buller was victorious in the Battle of the Tugela Heights, lifting the siege on 28 February 1900, the day after Piet Cronje at last surrendered to Roberts at Paardeberg. After Roberts took Bloemfontein (13 March 1900), Buller correctly predicted that the Boers would take to guerrilla warfare. Later he was successful in flanking Boer armies out of positions at Biggarsberg, Laing&#x27;s Nek and Lydenburg. It was Buller&#x27;s veterans who won the Battle of Bergendal in the war&#x27;s last set-piece action.

Buller was also popular as a military leader amongst the public in England, and he had a triumphal return from South Africa with many public celebrations, including those on 10 November 1900 when he went to Aldershot to resume his role as General Officer Commanding Aldershot District, later to be remembered as &quot;a Buller day&quot;. He spent the following months giving lectures and speeches on the war, was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in Nov 1900, and received the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Plymouth in April 1901. However, his reputation had been damaged by his early reverses in South Africa, especially within the Unionist government. When public disquiet emerged over the continuing guerrilla activities by the defeated Boers, the Minister for War, St. John Brodrick and Lord Roberts sought a scapegoat. The opportunity was provided by the numerous attacks in the newspapers on the performance of the British Army. The matter came to a head when a virulent piece written by &quot;The Times&quot; journalist Leo Amery was publicly answered by Buller in a speech on 10 October 1901. Brodrick and Roberts saw their opportunity to pounce and, summoning Buller to an interview on 17 October, Brodrick, with Roberts in support, demanded his resignation on the grounds of breaching military discipline. Buller refused and was summarily dismissed on half pay on 22 October. His request for a court martial was refused, as was his request to appeal to the King.

==Later life==
There were many public expressions of sympathy for Buller, especially in the West Country, where in 1905 by public subscription a notable statue by Adrian Jones of Buller astride his war horse was erected in Exeter on the road from his home town of Crediton (facing away from Crediton to the annoyance of its inhabitants).

He received the Honorary Freedom of the borough of Blandford on 1 December 1902.

Buller described himself as a Whig and a Liberal Unionist, but declined a number of offers, from both sides, to stand for Parliament at the 1906 election. Buller continued his quiet retirement, until on 29 May 1907 he accepted the post of Principal Warden of the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company which he held until his death in 1908.

==Marriage and offspring==

In 1882, aged 43, he married Lady Audrey Jane Charlotte Townshend (d. 1926), widow of Greville Howard (son of Charles Howard, 17th Earl of Suffolk) by whom she had issue, and daughter of John Townshend, 4th Marquess Townshend by his wife Elizabeth Jane Crichton-Stuart, daughter of Lord George Stuart, younger son of John Crichton-Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. By his wife he had issue an only child and daughter:
* (Audrey Charlotte) Georgiana Buller (1884–1953), awarded the Royal Red Cross (R.R.C.) and a Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire (1920), of Bellair House, Exeter. She served as an administrator of the War Hospitals in Exeter during World War I and died unmarried in 1953.

==Death, burial and succession==
Buller died on 2 June 1908, at the family seat, Downes House, Crediton, Devon, and is buried in the churchyard of Holy Cross Church in Crediton. The entire western side of the chancel arch inside the church forms an elaborate monument to Sir Redvers.

As he died without male progeny he was succeeded in the family estates by his next surviving younger brother Arthur Tremayne Buller (born 1850), his father&#x27;s fifth son.

==Legacy==
Historian Richard Holmes (1946–2011) commented that Buller has gone down as &quot;one of the bad jokes of Victorian military history&quot;, and quotes a famous verdict that he was &quot;an admirable captain, an adequate major, a barely satisfactory colonel and a disastrous general&quot;. Viscount Esher called him &quot;a gallant fellow but no strategist&quot;. Wolseley praised his &quot;stern determination of character&quot;. At least one recent historian has been kinder to his reputation:

==Place name tributes==
===England===
In England the Royal Corps of Transport barracks at Aldershot is named after him, as is a road in North Camp between Farnborough and Aldershot, and Buller Court in Farnborough (built upon the site of Buller House). Two adjacent roads near the underground station in Wood Green, London, namely Redvers Road and Buller Road (adjacent to Mafeking Road), bear his name, as do a road in Brighton, Buller Road in Southampton, Redvers Buller Road in Chesterfield, Derbyshire (adjacent to Baden Powell Road and Lord Roberts Road (after Lord Roberts of Kandahar)), Buller Street in Derby, Buller Road in Croydon and Buller Street and Mews in Bury, Lancashire (yards from the old Lancashire Fusiliers Wellington Barracks on Bolton Road). Chatham also has a Redvers Road and a Buller Road next to each other, opposite a Natal Road, and adjacent to roads and avenues named after some other Boer War Generals: Haig, Kitchener, Symons and White. Leicester also has a Buller Road adjacent to other streets named after Anglo Boer War Generals. Brighton also has a Redvers and a Buller Road, along with other references to the war: Mafeking Road, Ladysmith Road and Kimberley Road nearby. Buller Road in Exeter is close to Redvers Road, crossed by Nelson Road. Exeter School has a Buller House.

===Canada===
In British Columbia Buller Street in Ladysmith is named after him, near Roberts Street and Kitchener Street. The town of Redvers, in Saskatchewan, is named after him. In Ontario, Buller Street in Woodstock is named after him.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Buller Street in Port of Spain is one of seven streets bearing the names of officers of the British Army who distinguished themselves during the Second Boer War: Roberts, Kitchener, Baden-Powell, Buller, Methuen, MacDonald and William Forbes Gatacre.

==Monuments==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England.

===Winchester Cathedral===
There is a memorial to Buller, in the form of his recumbent effigy, in the north transept of Winchester Cathedral, England. The inscription reads, &quot;A great leader – Beloved of his men.&quot;

===Exeter===
A bronze equestrian statue of Buller by Adrian Jones (1905) is situated in Exeter at the junction of New North Road and Hele Road, on the route between the city and Buller&#x27;s home at Downes, Crediton, and since 1970 it has stood outside Exeter College. In January 2021, Exeter City Council voted to move the statue away from the college on the grounds that its connection to &quot;British imperialism&quot; meant it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; to be &quot;outside an educational establishment which includes young people from diverse backgrounds&quot;. In February 2021, the council abandoned plans to move the statue, though temporary information boards will be installed and the council will consider removing the words &quot;He saved Natal&quot; from the plinth.

===Crediton===
The entire western side of the chancel arch inside Holy Cross Church in Crediton forms an elaborate monument to Buller, designed by William Douglas Caröe with sculpture of St George by Nathaniel Hitch (1845–1938). A brass mural tablet was erected in Crediton Church by his only daughter Georgiana Buller. The public house at 37 High Street in Crediton, originally a Wetherspoons, bears his name.

<text>Hungarian wine has a history dating back to the Kingdom of Hungary. Outside Hungary, the best-known wines are the white dessert wine Tokaji aszú (particularly in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia) and the red wine Bull&#x27;s Blood of Eger (Egri Bikavér).

==Etymology==

Only three European languages have words for wine that are not derived from Latin: Greek, Basque, and Hungarian. The Hungarian word for wine, &quot;bor&quot;, is ultimately of Middle Persian origin.

==History==
The Romans brought vines to Pannonia, and by the 5th century AD, there are records of extensive vineyards in what is now Hungary. The Hungarians brought their wine-making knowledge from the East. According to Ibn Rustah, the Hungarian tribes were familiar with wine-making a long time before the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin.

Over the following centuries, new grape varieties were brought in from Italy and France. Most of the production was of white wine in that period. 
During the Ottoman occupation of Hungary, an ancient variety of grapes was used to make the robust red-wine blend later known as Bikavér (Bull&#x27;s Blood), after a supposed secret ingredient in the wine that fortified the defenders of Eger in 1552.

It was also during the Turkish occupation that the Tokaj region became known for dessert wines, harvested late to encourage noble rot. Tokaji aszú is mentioned in a document of 1571, and it was famously christened by Louis XIV of France (1638-1715) &quot;Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum&quot; – Wine of Kings, King of Wines.

After the Ottoman Empire ceded Hungary to the Austrians in 1699, the Germanic influence was felt with the introduction of grape varieties such as Blauer Portugieser. That influence also showed in the start in 1730 of the world&#x27;s first vineyard classification in Tokaj, based on soil, aspect and propensity to noble rot.

From 1882, the phylloxera epidemic hit Hungary hard, with the traditional field blends of Eger and the many grapes of Tokaj being replaced with monocultures, often of Blaufränkisch (Kékfrankos) and the Bordeaux varieties in red wine districts, and of Furmint, Muscat and Hárslevelű in Tokaj. The 20th century saw the introduction of modern grapes such as Zweigelt, which were easier to grow and to vinify than Kadarka. Under Communism quality was neglected in favour of overcropping, pasteurisation, and industrial production. Since 1989, there has been renewed interest in the traditional varieties and much new investment, particularly in Tokaj-Hegyalja.

==Wine regions and styles==
The official list of wine regions is defined by a ministerial decree. The current list includes 22 wine regions, which are usually grouped into five to seven larger regions.
=== Balaton, with sub-regions ===

*Badacsony: volcanic soils, full-bodied whites with considerable acidity. One of the few sources of Kéknyelű grapes.
*Balatonboglár: full-bodied whites and reds with moderate acidity.
*Balaton-felvidék: volcanic soils, full-bodied whites with considerable acidity.
*Balatonfüred-Csopak: terra rossa soils, full-bodied whites with considerable acidity.
*Nagy-Somló (or Somló): volcanic soil, full-bodied whites with high acidity. Main varieties are: Olaszrizling, Hárslevelű and Furmint.
*Zala: mainly white wines.
The main variety of the region is Olaszrizling.

Hungary&#x27;s most famous wine region lies in the foothills of the Zemplén Mountains of the far north of the country; in fact the traditional area crosses into the southeast corner of modern Slovakia. The area is notable for its long warm autumns and mists that come in from the River Bodrog, creating perfect conditions for noble rot. This can contribute towards creating the botrytised (&quot;aszú&quot;) grapes for which the region is famous. These are individually picked as late as mid-November into buckets (&quot;puttonyos&quot;) and crushed to a paste. Varying amounts of this &quot;aszú&quot; paste are then added to non-&quot;aszú&quot; must or wine made from a mix of Furmint, Hárslevelű, Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains, Kövérszőlő or Zéta grapes, and left to ferment. The resulting wine is then aged in relatively small barrels in a labyrinth of cellars in the soft volcanic tuff, on whose walls thick blankets of fungus regulate the humidity.

Given that &quot;aszú&quot; conditions only happen in perhaps three vintages per decade, much dry Furmint is also produced. Other grapes grown in the area include Hárslevelű, Muscat Blanc, Kövérszőlő and Zéta.

For centuries the main product of the area was the sweet wine, mainly the botrytised selections. The dry Furmint drew the attention of the world&#x27;s wine connoisseurs and experts when the Úrágya 2000 single vineyard selection was introduced by István Szepsy. The wine expressed great minerality, complexity and structure, which has been experienced only in the finest white wines of historic regions like Burgundy or the Mosel before. The aging potential was also promising. In 2003 more producers of Mád village produced single vineyard selected dry Furmint wines with great success. Mád village, with its almost 1200 ha, had the opportunity to produce high quality dry Furmint wine in significant quantity as a commune level wine, which can express the unique volcanic terroir of the region, this wine is named after its appellation Mád and produced by István Szepsy Jr. in the Szent Tamás Winery.

<text>Sauwerd is a village in the municipality of Het Hogeland, Groningen, Netherlands. Until the local government reorganization of 1990 the village was the head of the former municipality of Adorp.

The village of Sauwerd is 7 to 10 kilometers away from the nearest city, Groningen. The village is built on a wierde, from which it gets the second part of its name. It is inhabited by an estimated 1,100 people. The internationally known swimmer Ranomi Kromowidjojo was born in Sauwerd and lived there for most of her youth.

==Facilities==
There is one primary school in Sauwerd, called De Meander (the meander). There is one cooperative grocery store. Sauwerd has a sports complex called De Lange Twee (meaning The Long Two). The park features a football club called VV SIOS with two football fields. There is also a tennis club in the complex called TV Onstaborg.

There are two churches in Sauwerd. One is a Reformed church and the other is a PKN church. Until 1840 there was a medieval church building in the village. This was demolished in that year due to dilapidation. Simultaneously, the medieval church in Groot Wetsinge was demolished. A new church was built halfway between both villages, in Klein-Wetsinge.

Sauwerd has its own train station located on the Groningen-Delfzijl and Groningen-Roodeschool line. These lines form the eastern border of the village. In 2003 track doubling was completed between Groningen Noord railway station and Sauwerd. Until that time the line was one of the busiest pieces of single track in the Netherlands. On 25 July 1980 two passenger trains collided in neighbouring Winsum, with 9 deaths and 21 injuries. 
There is a bus stop in Sauwerd and a train station.

<text>SOCOM II U.S. Navy SEALs is a tactical third-person shooter video game developed by Zipper Interactive and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It is the sequel to &quot;SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs&quot;.

The online servers for this game, along with other PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable &quot;SOCOM&quot; titles, were shut down on August 31, 2012.

==Gameplay==
&quot;SOCOM II U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; is a third-person tactical shooter. There are 12 different single-player missions: split equally between Albania, Algeria, Brazil and Russia. There are five different ranks that can be played in the game: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, Captain and Admiral. The player starts with the first three ranks unlocked, but must finish the single player game on Commander to unlock Captain, and on Captain to unlock Admiral. Players can unlock new models for multiplayer, as well as movies, music, concept art, and credits by completing certain objectives.

Each mission has primary, secondary, and hidden bonus objectives. Players have to complete all the primary objectives to win the mission, and secondary objectives are optional, but add to the overall score for the mission. The hidden bonus objectives usually help make other missions easier. For example, finding a map in one mission means the player will not have to work to find that place in the next mission. A letter grade is received at the end of each mission based on 4 categories of score: Stealth, Accuracy, Teamwork, and Objective Completion. In single player, orders can be given to the rest of the team. This can be done using either the command menu or a USB headset. The menu features new command options, enabling the player to order their teammates to drop to the ground and hold position when outdoors.

The online and LAN multiplayer portion of &quot;SOCOM II U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; requires a broadband connection for play. This mode sets two teams of up to eight, SEALs and Terrorists, against each other. The default round time is six minutes, and each game is decided based on the first team to win 6 of 11 possible rounds. Each team spawns at opposite sides of the map, and proceeds to pursue its objective. When a character dies, the player must wait for the next round to resume play. While dead, the player may monitor the status of his teammates, and may change his weapon load. In a room created by a given &quot;SOCOM II U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; user, factors such as the number of rounds, round type, round time, weapon restrictions, and friendly fire can all be adjusted to the creator&#x27;s liking. 

&quot;SOCOM II U.S. Navy SEALs&quot; supports chat and prohibits in-game loitering. Voice chat is permitted in server lobbies, but not while in the armory of game lobbies. There are in-game options to mute certain players and to switch to different channels of communication (offense, defense, etc.). Problems with locating acquaintances in the original SOCOM online lead to the development of both a Friend List and a Clan Roster. The game features twelve new online maps, along with ten maps from the original &quot;SOCOM&quot;. The maps carried over from &quot;SOCOM&quot; have undergone minor changes such as turrets and breaches being added, daytime maps being switched to night and some paths being blocked, while others have been opened. Three additional maps could be played by purchasing an issue of the &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot; which came with a CD. Players would then install the contents of the CD onto their PS2 hard drive. Online capabilities were terminated on August 31, 2012.

==Plot==
The game first begins when the SEAL team operatives Specter (Paul Mercier), Jester (Jason Spisak), Wardog (Michael Clarke Duncan), and Vandal (Larry Cedar) are alerted by an informant codenamed MALLARD of a black market group called the Sesseri Syndicate, led by a man named Cassrioti Sesseri (Kast Hasa), who are trafficking and selling weapons and plutonium from their bases in Albania and sending them to cities from London to Cairo. The SEALs are sent in to investigate, locate and destroy the Syndicate&#x27;s weapon caches and if possible, capture a mid-level member named Besnik for interrogation. In the second and third missions, the Bravo element in the team are replaced by two, highly trained Special Air Service (SAS) operatives, callsigns Sabre and Reaver. The SEALs and their SAS counterparts are charged with bringing down the Syndicate, first by shutting down an abandoned factory in Shkodër as well as capturing or killing the man over the factory, A general named Mizlech Rugova, then capturing or killing the remaining leaders at their stronghold, the Sesseri family castle in the Albanian mountains. The team is able to neutralize the Syndicate&#x27;s leadership and the organization falls apart.

In Brazil, a group calling themselves the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Brazil (RAFB) have threatened to seize control of the government there. In the opening cutscene, a rebel deserter who had stolen cocaine escapes through the Amazon jungle until Quixada Christo (Fátima Marques), the leader of the RAFB, apprehends and murders him. Christo, the daughter of a prostitute and a wealthy industrialist, harbors a strong resentment of men, explaining for the RAFB&#x27;s majority demographic of females. In the first mission, within the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the four-man SEAL team is sent to recover information from an informant. When the SEALs arrive at the target building, the informant is not there but is being tortured by RAFB members in the opposite building. The team recovers him and later follows him to a discreet location, where he discloses information about a meeting between Christo and Lucimar, the leader of the local RAFB cell. They eventually capture the cell leader who reveals the whereabouts of an RAFB training camp. The SEALs traveled deep into the Amazonian rain forest and destroyed an underground cocaine factory, which was being used by the RAFB to fund their operations. With their funds cut, Christo and the RAFB made a last desperate attempt to destabilize the government by seizing the &quot;Grand Parana Dam.&quot; The RAFB threatened that if their demands are not met, they will blow up the dam, crippling the Brazilian economy. The SEAL team is sent in to retake the dam, defuse any explosive devices on site and kill Christo. The SEALs are successful and the RAFB is no longer a threat.

In Algeria, a separatist faction called the Algerian Patriotic Front (APF), under General Heydar Mahmood, are instigating a coup to take control of the Algerian government. APF soldiers are overrunning the city of Bejaia, where CHA (Coalition for Humanitarian Aid) workers and peacekeepers (similar to United Nations peacekeepers) were staying on a humanitarian mission. The SEAL team is sent to recover the CHA personnel and protect them from APF troops that are in control of the city. They later have to secure an area around the U.S. Embassy, where two State Department workers were left behind in the confusion of the evacuation of the city. They recover them and defend them from continuous attacks from the APF. After a long, intense firefight, an HH-60 Pave Hawk arrives and evacuates the group.

In Russia, a group calling itself Force Majeure, also known as the Global Liberation Front, is planning on making and using nuclear weapons to attack the United States. Intel from operatives in Eastern Europe suggests that Force Majeure&#x27;s movements in the abandoned Kellski naval shipyard in Kamchatka, is a potential terrorist threat. The SEALs are sent in to investigate, supported by two Spetsnaz operatives, callsigns Polaris (Jim Ward) and Bludshot (Quinton Flynn). The team discover evidences that Force Majeure is creating a nuclear bomb. With their findings, the team gets extracted by the USS &quot;Michigan&quot;. With Force Majeure nowhere to be found, things look grim, but fortunately the Russian Federal Security Service detects the presence of the terrorist group after investigating a supposed nuclear fuel spill. Disguised as members of the decontamination crew, Force Majeure operatives infiltrated the plant with additional terrorists arriving later. Their plan was to steal a vast amount of enriched uranium to be used in their &quot;dirty bomb&quot;. The SEALs and their comrades are sent into the plant to escort a radioactive specialist, codenamed Flatfoot, to see how much uranium had been stolen. The findings were not good, as almost all of the uranium storages had been emptied. In the final mission of the game, the SEALs infiltrate a ship, the &quot;Bitter Moon&quot;, with a large payload of radioactive material, bound for Seattle, Washington. The terrorists are planning to detonate the ship near to the Seattle. Aboard the ship, the SEALs discovered that MALLARD, the informant from the first mission, is actually an operative working for Force Majeure. He had used SOCOM to eliminate the Sesseri Syndicate, thus tying up a loose end, as Force Majeure had bought plutonium from the Syndicate before. The SEALs moves in and defuse all bombs placed on the ship. The female leader of Force Majeure, Valeska Lukanov, is either killed or captured. Mallard, whose real name is Arjan Manjani, is killed. The team releases a smoke grenade as a signal to the USS &quot;Michigan&quot; to stand down, and the mission is complete.

<text>Spaubeek is a village in the Dutch province of Limburg. It is located in the municipality of Beek, about 3 km south of the town of Geleen.
Spaubeek was a separate municipality until 1982, when it was merged with Beek. 

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1175 as Spaltbeke, and means &quot;valley with a brook&quot;. Spaubeek is a village which developed in the Middle Ages along the northern bank of Geleenbeek. Three linear settlements later appeared on the southern bank. In 1557, Jansgeleen Castle became the seat for the &quot;heerlijkheid&quot; Geleen en Spaubeek.

The Catholic St Laurentius Church is a three-aisled basilica-like church made out of sand stone which was constructed between 1925 and 1926 as a replacement of the 1837 church.

Huis Ten Dijken is an estate from the 17th century. The U-shaped residential area surrounded by a moat with an attached L-shaped office building. It was enlarged and modified several times during its history.

Spaubeek was home to 222 people in 1840. In 1896, a railway station opened on the Sittard to Herzogenrath (Germany) railway line. The railway line physically separated the northern settlement from the southern settlement. The A76 later increased the separation. Between 1 November 1875 and 1880, there was an early station of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ for medical aid to the population.

Spaubeek was an independent municipality until 1982. The main part was merged into Beek. A smaller part was added to the municipality of Geleen.

==Jansgeleen Castle ==
The history of Spaubeek was closely connected to that of the Jansgeleen Castle, nowadays called &quot;Sint Jansgeleen&quot;. This castle, built as House Spaubeek at a bench in the small Geleen river in the 13th century, was the first seat of the former County of Geleen in the 16th century. It got its name &quot;Heer Jansgelene&quot; after one of the former owners, Lord Jan Rode van Opsinnich in the 15th century, but was later erroneously renamed as &quot;Sint Jansgeleen&quot; after St. John the Baptist.

The castle, already in a bad shape at the end of the 19th century, and further damaged by the mine galleries of the nearby big Maurits mine at Geleen in the 1920s, was finally demolished in the 1930s. Only the buildings of the water mill (&quot;Jansmolen&quot;, hence &quot;Sint Jansmolen&quot;) and the forecourt (16th century) have remained, now both provincial monuments.

<doc id="1060669" wikidata="Q2218481" url="?curid=1060669" title="Oosterbeek">
<text>Oosterbeek is a village in the eastern part of Netherlands. It is located in the municipality of Renkum in the province of Gelderland, about west of Arnhem.

The oldest part of Oosterbeek is the Benedendorp (Lower Village), on the northern bank of the Lower Rhine. One landmark in the village is the Hervormde Kerk (Reformed Church), which has certain architectural sections that date back to the second half of the 10th century. It is the oldest church in the country which is still in use.

Oosterbeek was a separate municipality until 1818, when the area was divided between Doorwerth and the village of Renkum. In the 19th century, several mansions were built on the higher ground to the north of the old village. One of these mansions, called De Hemelse Berg, was destroyed in 1944. Another, called Hartenstein, is now home to the Airborne Museum. The construction of smaller buildings in the same area led to the creation of the Bovendorp (Upper Village). To the north of the built-up area lies the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery.

The village is known for its involvement in the September 1944 Battle of Arnhem, during which it was heavily damaged. General Roy Urquhart of Britain had his headquarters at Hotel Hartenstein. In May 1978 Urquhart opened the Airborne Museum in the hotel, which commemorates the Battle of Arnhem.

Oosterbeek is also the location of the Hotel de Bilderberg, where the Bilderberg Group first met in 1954.

==Oosterbeek School==

The Oosterbeek School is known as the birthplace of Dutch Impressionism, along with the nearby village of Wolfheze. Art historians call this the Barbizon of the North. The school&#x27;s most successful period was from 1841 until 1870, before the artists turned to Laren, Kortenhoef, Egmond aan Zee, Katwijk aan Zee, Scheveningen, and Noordwijk, where they founded new art colonies or painters&#x27; villages. During this time, they established the Pulchri Studio in The Hague and opened the second Golden Age of Dutch painting. Consequently, they became the forerunners of the Modern art movement in the Netherlands.

Artists who were part of the movement near Oosterbeek include Gerard Bilders, Paul Gabriël, Barend Cornelis Koekkoek, Jacob Maris, Matthijs Maris, Willem Maris, Anton Mauve, Hendrik Mesdag, Willem Roelofs, and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch.

==Transport==
Oosterbeek has a railway station that opened on 16 May 1845. It is on the Amsterdam–Arnhem railway (Rhijnspoorweg). The primary bus line, 352, connects Oosterbeek with Wageningen and Arnhem.

==Airborne March==
The commemorative Airborne March is held in Oosterbeek every year on the first Saturday of September. The event started in 1947 and involves thousands of people, who walk 10 kilometers, 15 kilometers, or 25 kilometers. A 40-kilometer distance was added in the early 21st century.

==Well-known people==

* Eric Corton (1969), singer, actor, and presenter
* Esmée Denters (1988), singer
* Albertino Essers (1969), darts player
* Ronald Koeman (1963), ex-football player and coach
* Kate ter Horst (1906), hero of the Battle of Arnhem, cared for British paratroopers injured in the battle

The village used to be a part of the jurisdiction of &quot;Gorecht&quot;. The first confirmed mention of the village is in a charter from the year 1249 where it is called &quot;Crepeswalda&quot;. Later it is also mentioned as Crepeswolda, Crepiswald, Crep(p)eswolde, Creppeswolde or Crepelliswald. 

The name Kropswolde probably relates to the old-Frisian word *krepel (&quot;cripple or limping&quot;). Other explanations point to a family name *Gripo or to the old-Saxion or old-Dutch word &quot;krop&quot; or &quot;croppe&quot; that can mean curvature in the landscape. It has even been speculated that the name comes from the name of an ancient tribal chief named Cruptorix, with reference to the Annals of Tacitus (Lib.IV.73) that mention a villa named Cruptorigis (= &quot;belonging to Cruptorix&quot;) in the woods of Baduhenna that could be found in the North of the Netherlands.[2]

From the 13th til the 15th century, Kropswolde developed into a peat colony, with most of the land owned by different monastic orders. Citizens of the city of Groningen also had peat digs there. The peat was transported to the city over the Hunze river. Traffic over the Hunze was controlled by the &quot;Schuitenschuiversgilde&quot; (&quot;boat pushers guild&quot;), founded in 1403 to transport all the peat from the areas surrounding Kropswolde. Apart from them, only inhabitants of Kropswolde, Wolfsbarge and Westerbroek were allowed to transport peat, providing their ships had less capacity than those of the guild. 

During the 17th, 18th and early 19th century a number of beautiful country houses and manor farms were built in Kropswolde for high-ranking citizens from Groningen and Hoogezand. The church, which still exists, was built in 1773. Its tower dates back to 1888. 

Until the early 20th century there was enough peat to process. Afterward, the land was mainly used for agriculture. 

At the time of the Batavian Republic in 1798, Kropswolde was temporarily combined with and Kiel-Windeweer.

<text>Martenshoek () is a neighbourhood of Hoogezand and former village in the Dutch province of Groningen. It is located in the municipality of Midden-Groningen, about 2 km west of the town of Hoogezand.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1652 as St. Martenshoek, and means &quot;neighbourhood with Martin of Tours as a patron saint&quot;. Martenshoek developed near the sluice on the Winschoterdiep. It was the gateway to the peat colonies, and developed into a trade and industry centre.

Martenshoek was home to 570 people in 1840. In 1905, a railway station opened in the village.

Martenshoek forms a single urban area with Hoogezand and is considered a neighbourhood of Hoogezand. A large part of the neighbourhood consists of industry.

<text>Oxbow is a town in the southeast of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. It is located on the Canadian Pacific Railway and on Highway 18. It is approximately west of Saskatchewan&#x27;s border with Manitoba and approximately north of the Canada–US border with North Dakota.

The town&#x27;s official motto is &quot;Progress with Pride&quot;, but the town&#x27;s weekly paper, the &quot;Oxbow Herald&quot;, has long included two other unofficial town mottoes on its masthead: &quot;Queen of the Scenic Souris&quot; (a reference to the Souris River, near which Oxbow is situated) and &quot;Where Oil and Agriculture Meet&quot; (a reference to the town&#x27;s two major industries).

==History==
The first settlers around Oxbow - mainly of English, Irish, and Scottish descent - began homesteading the area under the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; in 1882. The town&#x27;s weekly newspaper, the &quot;Oxbow Herald&quot;, was founded in 1903. The town was incorporated in 1904.

The town was named after the &quot;oxbow&quot; in the Souris River near which the town is situated. Etymologically, the word &quot;oxbow&quot;, as applied to a river, is a metaphor for the oxbow worn by an ox.

The town grew rapidly in the years following incorporation, reaching a population of 678 in 1916. The town&#x27;s population then hovered around 600-700 for the next several decades.

In the mid-1950s, oil companies began developing the oilfields around Oxbow. This set off a boom time, as personnel moved to Oxbow to work on drilling rigs and provide other services to the oil industry. As of 2010 there has been roughly 38,000 oil and gas wells around the surrounding area. Agriculture and oil remain the two major industries of the town.

On October 16, 1982, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Officer Cst. Butler was killed while on duty in Oxbow. A high speed pursuit had begun earlier west of Oxbow with the pursuit heading towards Oxbow. Cst. Butler had set up a road block with his RCMP cruiser across the roadway. A high speed collision occurred with Cst. Butler still in the vehicle. He later died of his injuries. Two occupants of the evading vehicle were also killed.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Oxbow had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Government ==
The mayor is Doug Pierce, who was elected by acclamation in October 2020.

==Education==

The main school in Oxbow is Oxbow Prairie Horizons School (OPHS), a K–12 school, with a Preschool Program. Oxbow Prairie Horizons School opened in the 2010-11 school year.

Prior to the construction of Oxbow Prairie Horizons School, Oxbow had two schools: (1) Oxbow Prairie Heights School (OPHS), which taught Grades 6 through 12 (Oxbow Prairie Heights School opened in 1986, following renovations to the former Oxbow High School, which had taught Grades 7 through 12); and (2) Oxbow Elementary School, which was Grades K through 6 until 1985, and taught Grades K through 5 from 1985 to 2010.

In addition to the elementary school and high school, the Glenn McGuire School used to provide educational opportunities for intellectually and physically challenged students ranging in age from three to twenty-two years of age. As of September 1, 2008, the Glenn McGuire school has been demolished, and the physically challenged students have been integrated into the elementary school and high school.

==Sport and recreation==
Sporting sites available in Oxbow include tennis courts, ball diamonds, a motocross track, an artificial-ice skating rink, a curling rink, and an outdoor swimming pool. Moose Creek Regional Park is located north-west of Oxbow, and it offers camping, fishing, boating, water-skiing, a nine-hole golf course with grass greens, and driving and putting ranges.

Oxbow is home to the Oxbow Huskies. They play in the senior men&#x27;s Big 6 Hockey League.

The Oxbow Chiefs of the Saskota Baseball League play at the local ball diamonds.

=== Bow Valley Park ===
Bow Valley Park is a campground with many recreational opportunities south of Oxbow along the Souris River. Some of the amenities and activities include ball diamonds, a pavilion, outdoor theatre, potable water, and a boat launch. The park is also home to the annual Bow Valley Jamboree. In 2011, the Souris River flooded destroying much of the park. It cost $300,000 and took almost six years to restore the park. The official grand reopening was in June of 2017.

==Literary references==

Renowned Canadian journalist Ralph Allen came from Oxbow. Allen was the author of several books, including the novel &quot;Peace River Country&quot; (1958) and a history of Canada during the period of the two world wars entitled &quot;Ordeal By Fire: Canada, 1910–1945&quot; (1961). In 1967, Christina McCall Newman edited a collection of Allen&#x27;s columns from &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; entitled &quot;The Man From Oxbow&quot;. Oxbow&#x27;s town museum is named in Allen&#x27;s honour.

During his time as Editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Allen (who was famous for the quote, &quot;this will have to be re-written before we can reject it&quot;) mentioned Oxbow several times in the magazine. The November 10, 1956, cover featured a full-colour illustration of the offices of the Oxbow Herald newspaper and showed owner Joe Pedlar at work.

There is also a reference to Oxbow in &quot;My Discovery of America&quot; by Farley Mowat (1985). The book is a memoir detailing why Mowat was denied entry to the US in 1985. In the Appendix, he points out that one of the reasons was that he had supported an Oxbow group that was opposed to nuclear weapons at the Minot Air Force Base.

Another reference to Oxbow can be found in Peter Newman&#x27;s &quot;Mavericks: Canadian Rebels, Renegades and Anti-Heroes&quot; (2010), in the chapter recounting the history of the Bronfman family&#x27;s early involvement with bootlegging during prohibition, prior to their establishment of the Seagram Company in Montreal.

Oxbow was also infamously the target of an article by Edmonton author W. P. Kinsella (who was catapulted to fame when his book &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; (1980) was made into the movie &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; by Kevin Costner in 1989). Kinsella was sent to Oxbow by &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine after Oxbow had the dubious distinction of having Canada&#x27;s highest per-capita murder rate. Years later, Kinsella followed up with a second article, again in &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.

<text>Sir William Ian Clunies Ross (22 February 189920 June 1959) was an Australian veterinary scientist. He has been described as the &quot;architect&quot; of Australia&#x27;s scientific boom, for his stewardship of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australian scientific organisation.

==Family==

Ian Clunies Ross was born in Bathurst, New South Wales on 22 February 1899. His grandfather, Robert Clunies Ross, was a brother of John Clunies-Ross, who settled with his family and crew on Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1826-7 and proclaimed a kingdom. He married Janet Leslie Carter on 6 October 1927, in Sydney, Australia. The couple had three sons, Anthony, Adrian and David.

==Education==
Clunies Ross was educated at Newington College (1912–1916) and in 1917 he entered the University of Sydney, in the Agriculture Faculty, and transferred to veterinary science at the beginning of 1918, graduating with second class honours in 1920.

His father died in 1914, and his brothers Egerton and Rob died in WWI, killed in action and from pneumonic influenza respectively.

==Veterinary career==

In 1921, Clunies Ross was given a temporary lectureship in veterinary anatomy; the following year he was made a Fellow of The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, allowing him to a travel overseas. He spent a year working on animal parasites at the Molteno Institute for Research in Parasitology in Cambridge and the School of Tropical Medicine in London. He also spent time in the United States, mainly in Texas and Louisiana, where he looked at methods of field control of parasitic diseases. When he returned to Sydney he set up a veterinary practice, lectured at the university and continued his own research on the hydatid parasite (&quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot;), the liver fluke (&quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;), and the dog-tick (&quot;Ixodes holocyclus&quot;). He developed an immunization for dogs to protect against the dog-tick.

==CSIR==
In 1926 Clunies Ross was appointed parasitologist to the newly established Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and was funded to continue research at the Sydney University Veterinary School. On 6 October 1927, he married English honours graduate Janet Carter at the Catholic Apostolic Church, Redfern. They had three sons: Anthony, Adrian and David. By mid-1931, three other researchers were working with him, and in November 1931 the team moved into CSIR&#x27;s new McMaster Animal Health Laboratory. Clunies Ross was appointed as the officer-in-charge of the laboratory. In 1928, his thesis on the hydatid parasite was accepted by the University of Sydney for the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Science. Work at the McMaster Laboratory on the control of sheep liver-fluke, made a significant improvement to animal health and the returns from agriculture in the 1930s.

==Science administration==

Following his time at the McMaster Laboratory, Clunies Ross spent times in Asia, and he was the Australian representative at the International Wool Secretariat in London from 1937 to 1940. He enjoyed this administrative role. He also served as a member of Australia&#x27;s delegation to the League of Nations Assembly in 1938. He and his family returned to Australia when World War II broke out, he returned to the Veterinary school at the University of Sydney. He was president of the Australian Institute of International Affairs from 1941 to 1945. He was a notable member of the Australian Veterinary Association. He was a vocal commentator on international affairs throughout the remainder of his career.

==CSIRO==
In 1943, Clunies Ross was appointed Director of Scientific Personnel in the Commonwealth Directorate of Manpower and also Adviser on the Pastoral Industry to the Department of War Organization of Industry. He held these positions until 1945 while continuing work connected with his university position. At the end of the war he left the university to assist the CSIR in planning sheep and wool-textile research. In 1946 he was appointed a full-time member of the CSIR Executive Committee, which was situated in Melbourne. He served as the executive officer of the CSIR until 1949 when it was renamed the CSIRO. He was chairman of the CSIRO until his death in 1959. During this time he oversaw the release of myxomatosis for rabbit control in Australia. In his retirement he was president of the Melbourne Wallaby Club 1954 – 1955.

While in his role at the CSIRO Clunies Ross came into conflict with pioneering radio astronomer Ruby Payne-Scott over the role of women in the organization, and her role in particular. The two met in person to discuss the disparity in pay and working conditions between male and female employees of CSIRO, but this did not result in change to the status quo. When Payne-Scott&#x27;s marriage and pregnancy were revealed, the two had a hostile exchange of letters, and CSIRO consequently deprived her of permanent employee status and pension funds.

==Later years and legacy==

In 1954, Clunies Ross was knighted and appointed Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), and made a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA).

He died of atherosclerotic heart disease on 20 June 1959 in Melbourne, and is buried in Box Hill cemetery.

The career of Ian Clunies Ross is widely commemorated in Australia. The Australian $50 bank note issued in 1973 celebrated Ian Clunies Ross on one side, and Howard Florey on the other. The National Science Centre in Parkville, Victoria was renamed as Clunies Ross House in 1968, and decorated with a mural by Robert Ingpen celebrating Clunies Ross&#x27; career.

<text>Geerdijk is a village in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Twenterand. It became a village in 2009.

== History ==
Geerdijk was founded in the mid-19th century along the canal Almelo–De Haandrik as a peat excavation village. It was a Catholic enclave which was settled by colonists from neighbouring Germany and the area around Slagharen and Dedemsvaart. In 1868, an independent parish was established.

In 1906, the Geerdijk railway station opened on the Mariënberg–Almelo railway, and closed on 29 April 2016. It was closed, because there were not enough passengers and Arriva wanted to increase the speed to allow an extension of the line to Hardenberg.

Geerdijk used to be part of the municipality of Den Ham. In 2001, it was merged into Twenterand. It was considered a hamlet of Vroomshoop. In 2009, Geerdijk separated from Vroomshoop, and became a village.

Grijpskerk was a separate municipality until 1990, when it was merged with Zuidhorn.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1500 as &quot;Ruygwerdt alias Grijpskerke&quot;, and probably means church founded by Claus Grijp, the priest of Der Aa-kerk in Groningen. The griffin on the weather vane of the church is probably also related to the Grijp family. Grijpskerk is a dike village which developed after the Ruigewaard was &quot;poldered&quot; in 1425. The dike later became the main the road from Groningen to Friesland.

The church from around 1500 was destroyed in 1582 by plundering soldiers during the Dutch Revolt. It was rebuilt between 1605 and 1612, and extended in 1856. The Mennonite church originally stood in Pieterzijl and was moved to Grijpskerk in 1892.

Grijpskerk was home to 611 people in 1840. In 1866, a railway station opened on the Leeuwarden to Groningen railway line. The station is still in service, however the building was demolished in 1976.

Grijpswerk used to be an independent municipality until 1990 when it was merged into Zuidhorn. In 2019, it became part of the municipality of Westerkwartier.

<text>Market Weighton ( ) is a town and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is one of the main towns in the East Yorkshire Wolds and lies midway between Hull and York, about from either one. According to the 2021 UK Census Market Weighton parish had a population of 7,459, an increase on the 2011 UK census population of 6,429, which was an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 5,212.

== History ==
The 19th-century English lexicographer Sir William Smith proposed Market Weighton as the location of the still-undiscovered Roman camp of Delgovicia. Historically the town was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wicstun&quot;, and was granted its charter to become a market town in 1251; the markets ceased in the nineteenth century. Notable architecture includes: a parish church, parts of which are Norman, the Londesborough Arms (an 18th-century coaching inn), a Wesleyan chapel, a Methodist chapel and a high street still recognisable from the 19th century. Other sights of interest include the post office, the duck pond and Station Farm. Market Weighton history includes William Bradley, the Yorkshire Giant who at the age of 20 was tall.
In May of each year local residents take to the streets of Market Weighton for the Giant Bradley Day (formerly Giant Community Day) festival in a celebration of the life and times of William Bradley.
Industry in the town is largely based on agriculture. The town is known geologically for having given its name to the Market Weighton Axis.

The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long-distance footpath, passes through the town.

==Governance==
As a civil parish, Market Weighton has a town council, which operates under the East Riding of Yorkshire Council.

In 2003, after some local consultation, the Weighton Area Regeneration Partnership (WARP) adopted a slogan and logo, &#x27;The Heart of East Yorkshire&#x27;, intended to indicate both its central location in the county and the strength of the local community. WARP was dissolved in 2012 but the phrase continued in use to promote the area and on local signage.

==Landmarks==

Market Weighton has three churches. These are All Saints’ Church, St John&#x27;s Methodist Church and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. 
The church dedicated to All Saints was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.

== Transport ==

Market Weighton railway station was at the junction of the lines to Selby, Driffield, York and Beverley. The last train ran in 1965. The abandoned lines to Beverley and to Selby are now used as public paths as the Hudson Way and Bubwith Rail Trail, respectively.

Bus services, provided by East Yorkshire Motor Services, link the town with Beverley, Hull, Pocklington, York, Holme on Spalding Moor, Driffield and Bridlington.

The three-mile £5.1 million A1079 bypass opened in March 1991.

The Minsters Rail Campaign is campaigning to re-open the railway line between Beverley and York (with stops at Stamford Bridge, Pocklington and Market Weighton). The re-opened railway would skirt the edge of the town, as the former alignment has since been built over.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. However, BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire region is also the default BBC One variant given to Market Weighton postcodes on Channel 101 through satellite television such as Freesat.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Humberside, Greatest Hits Radio East Yorkshire, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Nation Radio East Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire and Vixen 101 is a community based radio station which broadcast to the town.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot;.

== Business ==

<text>Hemmen is a village in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is located in the municipality of Overbetuwe, 1 km northwest of Zetten.

Hemmen was a separate municipality until 1955, when it was merged with Valburg.

== History ==
It was first mentioned in 1327 as Hemmen. The etymology is unclear. The church probably dates from the 13th century. It was enlarged in 1741, and the tower has built around 1800. It was extensively restored in 1932 to 1933. Castle Hemmen was built in 1360, and demolished in 1750. In 1757, a manor house was built in its place and was surrounded by a moat. It was destroyed in 1945. In 1840, Hemmen was home to 209 people.

<text>Valburg is a village in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is located in the municipality of Overbetuwe, about 10 km northwest of Nijmegen.

Valburg was a separate municipality until 2001, when it became part of Overbetuwe.

== History ==
It was first mentioned in 792 or 793 as &quot;in uilla Falburcmarca&quot;, and means &quot;the castle of Falho (person)&quot;. The eastern side of the village developed into an &quot;esdorp&quot;.

<text>Olst is a town in the Dutch province of Overijssel, about north of Deventer. It is located in the municipality of Olst-Wijhe.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 947 Holsto. The etymology is unknown. Olst is an &quot;esdorp&quot; which developed along the IJssel river. In 1308, the dike along the river was built, and Olst became a stopover for the ships from Zwolle to Deventer.

The lower part of the tower of the Dutch Reformed church dates from around 1200. The tower was enlarged in 1336. The church was extensively modified between 1493 and 1494.

In the 15th century, the &quot;havezate&quot; (manor house) Averbergen was constructed on two yards from the former monastery Essen. The area is similar to the 947 reference, therefore, there might have been earlier predecessors. The manor house was owned by a branch of the van Voorst tot Voorst family. In 1814 it was sold, and later demolished. In 1966, a retirement home was built in its place.

Olst was home to 823 people in 1840. In 1866, a railway station was opened on the Arnhem–Leeuwarden railway. The railway line stimulated the industrialisation of Olst.

The grist mill Bökkers Mölle was built in 1895, however the lower part dates from 1729. The wind mill was in use until 1961, when an electro motor was installed. In 1990, it was sold to Solvay S.A. who operated a factory next to the wind mill. In 1993, it was sold on to a foundation who restored the wind mill in 1996, and it was recommissioned to grind professionally.

Until 2002, Olst was the seat of the municipality of the same name. The municipality was merged with that of Wijhe in 2001, keeping the name of the largest constituent part (Olst), until it was renamed Olst-Wijhe a year later.

<text>Nijverdal () is a town of approximately 25,000 inhabitants in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is the commercial centre and largest town within the municipality Hellendoorn.

Nijverdal (which means &quot;Industrious Valley&quot;) was founded in 1836 on the territory of the hamlet Noetsele. It was here that the Industrial Revolution in the Netherlands took root. Thomas Ainsworth (1795–1841) and Zak Dee Patmore (1799–1838) were two of its &quot;founding fathers&quot;. Textile production was the focus of industrial activity in Nijverdal, as it was for the rest of the Twente region. Some of the traditional factory buildings in the Art Deco or Jugendstil style still remain.

A river called the &quot;Regge&quot; runs through the town, and is the historical border between the two regions Twente and Salland, and the border of two Dutch dialects, which are Twents and Sallaands, respectively. Every native inhabitant of Nijverdal used to speak either one or both regional dialects but since the 1970&#x27;s dialect is in decline. Very few inhabitants younger than 30 use any dialect anymore.

==History==
Before World War II, Nijverdal had a small Jewish community. The municipal seat of the area, Hellendoorn, had a small synagogue and Jewish cemetery. The synagogue still exists as a storage shed behind one of the houses in the village, and the cemetery is no longer in use. It has about 20 graves, most from the nineteenth century and early 20th century. The municipality maintains the cemetery and protects it from vandalism.

The Jewish community was essentially erased by the Holocaust. Most of its members were murdered in Sobibor or Auschwitz.

On 22 March 1945, Nijverdal was severely bombed by allied bombers who were going after the German Reichskommissar of Austrian origin Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Seyss-Inquart was fleeing the advancing Allied forces and had set up his temporary headquarters in the Reformed School in Nijverdal, but had already left town at the time of the bombing. Over 73 people were killed, mainly at the Grotestraat.

In 1955, part of the municipality of Wierden was annexed (Eversberg, Konijnenbelt, Slettenhaar and Lochter) which is the only part of the municipality located on originally Twente soil. In the late 70&#x27;s the quarter of &#x27;Groot Lochter&#x27; arose here.

==Transportation==

* Railway station: Nijverdal

Since 31 March 2013, Nijverdal has a new railway station, due to major improvements to the railway connection between Zwolle and Enschede. This new station is part of the building of the Salland-Twente tunnel, a new &#x27;combination&#x27;-tunnel connection which leads the traffic of the N35 and the trains underneath Nijverdal. Before this new station was established the railway connection stopped at the old train station and continued at a temporary station Nijverdal West. During this time one pedestrian/bike bridge and one small tunnel connected the north side to the south side of the town.

== Sports ==
Nijverdal has a Water polo club, named Het Ravijn, of which both men and women teams play in the Dutch Premier League. Some women in the women&#x27;s team play for the Dutch team, which won gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

There is a large number of sports clubs in Nijverdal:

<text>Tegelen () is a village in the municipality of Venlo, situated in the Netherlands. It was an independent municipality until 2001, when it was merged into the municipality of Venlo.

==Tiglian==

The name of the glacial stage of Tiglian (part of the Pleistocene) is derived from Tegelen because of the many fossils found there from this era in the local clay.

==History==
During excavations in Tegelen Roman pottery and tile ovens were found. The Sint-Martinus church is mentioned in diocesan and monasterial archives dating back to the year 800. Because of its strategic location, various castles and reinforced farms were soon established. The most important of these were the and the . During the Middle Ages, there were several battles in and around Tegelen, because of its proximity to the walled city of Venlo. Over time, a barracks was established in Venlo, and a fortification in neighbouring Blerick. As a result, from the 16th century until the 18th century Tegelen was regularly visited by plundering armies.

===Part of Jülich===

For centuries Tegelen was part of the Duchy of Jülich, while neighbouring Venlo belonged to the Duchy of Guelders. So literally, according to the people of Tegelen Venlo was &quot;abroad&quot; and vice versa. This explains the differences between the local dialects of the neighbouring towns and the rivalry between these parts of the city that persists to this day. The black, uncrowned lion on a golden ground, in the coat of arms and the flag of Tegelen can be found in the coat of arms of the Duchy of Jülich.

For Jülich it was very important to have access to the Meuse river. Tegelen, with its harbour at Steyl, was the most northern one, the other one being Urmond near Sittard. In Napoleonic times, the former duchy of Jülich became part of the Roer department. Tegelen, Sittard and Urmond were ceded to the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, resulting in the Netherlands finally obtaining complete control of the river from Maastricht northward.

===Industrial activities===

Early in the 19th century Tegelen developed into a regional centre of industry. At first, tile and pottery factories were established, and later that century, metallurgy and tobacco factories. After 1900 agriculture was added to the mix. Pottery and related industries were very successful in Tegelen from 1750 until World War II.

Economic and social life before that war was dominated by a small number of factory-owning families that would scratch each other&#x27;s backs. One infamous episode illustrating the way they treated their work force and how they controlled their lives occurred during World War I. The producers of clay products claimed that the embargo on Germany brought them to the brink of bankruptcy, and the only way they could survive was to drastically reduce wages. The work force went on strike but soon the strike fund was depleted. The local clergy helped negotiate a settlement allowing labourers to return to work for a salary that barely exceeded subsistence levels. It later transpired that there had never been any risk of any of the producers going bankrupt, and that this drastic reduction in labour cost had allowed them to make exorbitant profits. This is still evident from the gigantic villas in which these families lived and of which a number are still standing.

After the war, the number of factories in Tegelen steadily decreased. All smelters, including Globe, known throughout the Netherlands for providing drainage covers, disappeared. There are still three operating factories producing clay products, all except Keramische Industrie Limburg, are now in foreign ownership. One chimney, previously owned by a stone cutter named Canoy Herfkens, is still standing as a reminder of Tegelen&#x27;s industrial heyday.

In 2001 Tegelen was merged into the municipality of Venlo.

==Culture==
The centuries-old expertise in ceramics and pottery is kept alive by courses held in the ceramic center of the tithe barn.

Tegelen has several theater, music and choral organisations. It is internationally famous for its Passion Play held every five years in the years that are divisible by 5, in Openluchttheater De Doolhof. These always attract many visitors. The same open air theater hosts Tegelen&#x27;s Bluesrock Festival every year.

==Characters==

Tegelen has had its fair share of colourful characters. By far the most famous of these is &quot;Baron&quot; , a Prussian aristocrat who inherited the castle of Holtmuhle in the 18th century. He loved the army life so much that he owned a privately financed army corps that fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

More locally famous, before the Second World War, were the pub owners &quot;Joës en Petatte Nelke&quot;, Gustaaf Schreurs and Petronella Muller, who had a song written about them and a statue erected for them in the market square.

&quot;En as weej wir nao Tegele gáon,&quot;
&quot;dèn gáon weej nao Petatte-Nelke.&quot;
&quot;Dao drinke weej ’n sjöpke beer,&quot;
&quot;en hebbe weej ouch vuël plezeer!&quot;
&quot;En Joes, dae haet zô’n lollig vrouwke,&quot;
&quot;die duit t’r sôkker in, die duit t’r sôkker in.&quot;
&quot;Al in det beer, al in det beer,&quot;
&quot;die duit t’r sôkker al in det beer!&quot;

Translation:

When we to Tegele return,
We&#x27;ll go and see Potato Nelke
Where we&#x27;ll knock back a pint of beer
and have some good old fashioned cheer!
And Joës&#x27;s lady is a joker,
She puts some sugar in, she puts some sugar in
Our pint of beer, our pint of beer,
She puts some sugar in our beer!

<doc id="1060716" wikidata="Q5436036" url="?curid=1060716" title="Farnley, Leeds">
<text>Farnley is a district in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, west of Leeds city centre, between Wortley, Bramley and the countryside around Pudsey and Gildersome, in the LS12 Leeds postcode area. It is part of the Leeds City Ward &quot;Farnley and Wortley&quot; with a population of 24,213 according to the 2011 Census. New Farnley is a nearby commuter village.

==Etymology==
The name of Farnley was first attested in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Fernelei&quot;. The name comes from the Old English words &quot;fearn&quot; (&#x27;fern&#x27;) and &quot;lēah&quot; (&#x27;open land in woodland&#x27;), and thus meant &#x27;clearing characterised by ferns&#x27;.

== Farnley ==
Farnley village (also known as Old Farnley) started as a small agricultural village dating back to early medieval times. When first recorded in the Domesday Book, it was in the Hundred of Morley and was part of the King’s land, with Ilbert de Lacy being the tenant-in-chief. The original Farnley village started around Cross Lane which serviced Farnley Hall (on Hall Lane) and the Farnley Manor House (at the junction of Hall Lane to Chapel Lane). The Manor and Estates of Farnley were held in 1086 by Swain Fitz Alric and then a number of his descendants until it passed by marriage to Sir James Danby in 1497. The Danbys held it for about 300 years before it was bought by James Armitage. Farnley was surrounded by the villages of Bawn, Upper Moor Side and Low Moor Side. Farnley was heavily wooded until the 19th century, and Farnley Wood was the meeting point for a would-be rebellion against Charles II in 1663 which was known as the Farnley Wood Plot (believed to have taken place in Sykes wood, at the bottom of Green Lane). Although the rebellion failed from lack of support, the betrayal led to 26 participants being condemned to death, with 16 hanged, drawn and quartered in York.

Farnley was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Leeds, in 1866 Farnley became a separate civil parish, on 26 March 1904 the parish was abolished to form Armley and Bramley. In 1901 the parish had a population of 4351.

The people of Farnley worked in the mills surrounding the area including the Butterbowl Mill and the three mills situated in the area around Post Hill (including Union Bridge Mill and the Woolen Mills of Farnley and Upper Mill).

New Farnley did not exist as a village until the early part of the 19th century when Edward Armitage started the Farnley Iron Works and Farnley Fireclay. He needed many workers so built houses for them, so what had been known as part of Farnley now became New Farnley. With the increasing urban expansion connected with the industrial revolution of the 19th century, Low Moor Side emerged into New Farnley and the Bawn into Farnley. The close proximity of these two settlements led to the whole area being referred to as New Farnley, while the area around Hall Lane and Cross Lane (the original Farnley Village) was popularly called Old Farnley.
At the lower area of Old Farnley sits St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church. St Michael&#x27;s church is in Farnley park near the stately home of Farnley Hall.

Shops in the original village of Farnley now include a hair salon, a newsagent, and a mini-mart. Farnley has a lower set of shops (in what was originally Bawn village) consisting of a pizza takeaway, a newsagent, a mini-mart, a butcher and Cow Close Community Corner. The area of Farnley is served by several schools, in particular Cobden Primary School, Lawns Park Primary School and The Farnley Academy.

Old Farnley is the western terminus for First Leeds Bus Routes 15 and 42. It is likely that past bus operators in Leeds coined the name Old Farnley to avoid confusion with Farsley, another nearby area of Leeds.

In 1904, Farnley Civil Parish was abolished to create the Armley and Bramley Civil Parish. The Farnley civil parish had included slightly more than the area between the ring road, Wood Lane, Back Lane, Tong Road and Park Spring; in particular it included New Farnley. The population of the civil parish was 4,351 in 1901 and 4,208 in 1911.

== New Farnley ==
New Farnley is a commuter village in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, west of Leeds city centre, on the A58 Leeds-Halifax main road. New Farnley lies about south west of Farnley and was part of the Farnley Civil Parish.

It grew around two historic settlements, Upper Moor Side and the modern centre of New Farnley Village, both of which had nucleated settlements recognisable in early estate maps. There are still buildings dating from the late 17th and early 18th-century standing in both locations. It was part of the ancient manor of Farnley, ownership of which was split and held by families including the Harringtons, Nevilles, Brudenells, Danbys and finally, the Armitages.

The discovery of a 3rd-century coin may point to Roman activity in the area. A field of Harper Farm has the name &#x27;Castle Hill&#x27;, leading to a local tradition (which appears to have originated with an estate manager of Farnley Hall) that it was the site of a Roman marching camp. The field name first appears in early modern estate maps. There are also Saxon field names in the village and remains of medieval ridge and furrow. Other evidence of medieval activity may be the place-name Snittels Farm, a possible corruption of &quot;spital&quot;, indicating the location of a medieval (leper?) hospital. However, there is no archaeological or documentary evidence to support this.

There was industrial development of the significant natural resources in the area from the early modern period (if not earlier). This industry led to the rapid expansion of settlement with the construction of workers housing in the 19th century. Despite this industrial activity a number of farms are still working in the area.

As the population increased, St James&#x27;s church and the Lancasterian School were built, both of which originally served as chapels of ease. There was also a Methodist chapel. Alms houses were built in the 19th century along with a village school. Local amenities included a recreation ground. There were a number of shops including The Village Chippy and Cooperative with grocers, butchers and drapers.

New Farnley now has a village co-op which includes a post office, Craven&#x27;s Fish and Chip shop which is over 120 years old and said to be haunted, also a pub, a barber shop, a beauty salon, Cobden Primary and Lawns Park Primary Schools, The Farnley Academy, and two churches. The centrally-located community centre is owned by the residents of the community and run on a voluntary basis. It is a hub for the activities of the village, is home to a local Mums and Tots group, and hosts several community nights over the year, e.g. at Halloween or Christmas.

<text>Varsseveld is a town in the Netherlands, located in the Dutch municipality of Oude IJsselstreek.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
At the start of the twelfth century, Varsseveld was part of the County of Lohn, a county within the Holy Roman Empire with its seat in Stadtlohn, nowadays Germany. Count Godschalk I of Lohn&#x27;s son Goldschalk built an estate in the village. In 2009, during the reconstruction of the village core, archeologists found out that the village probably had a town canal at that time, similar to that of neighbouring estates and towns such as Bredevoort.

After the Battle for Bredevoort between 1326 and 1326, the village was conquered by Reginald II, Duke of Guelders and became under influence of the Duchy of Guelders. In 1723, a fire hit the village, burning down all the buildings, including the church. Until 1794, when Napoleon invaded the Netherlands and abolished the feudal system, the Guelders village was under the administration of the County of Zutphen and the smaller district of Wisch.

Upon the formation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands after the French rule had ended, Varsseveld was a separate municipality between 1812 and 1818, when it was merged with Wisch.

===1945 Rademakersbroek mass execution===

On 2 March 1945, when the village was still under control of the Nazi Forces, a mass execution of 46 people took place on Rademakersbroek, a road just outside of the town. The victims had been chosen at random and had been taken from the Kruisberg prison in Doetinchem, where they had been imprisoned for numerous reasons, ranging from taking part in Resistance activities to unknowingly buying a stolen bike. The mass execution was a revenge attack in response to the earlier discovery of four dead Nazi officers in a semi-burnt vehicle near the village.

Four weeks later, on 31 March 1945, the village was liberated by Canadian forces.

===After World War II===
In the 1950s and 1960s, the village industrialised and became a regional leader in the production of wooden products such as doors, clogs, drawers and closets. This made the village relatively affluent during that time.

==Roman urban myth==
Long time, Varsseveld held on to the urban myth that it had been a border town to the Roman Empire. A part of the myth centred around the interpretation of the etymology of the town&#x27;s name. According to one local etymologist, Varsseveld had been derived from the Roman general Varus and &quot;veld&quot; (meaning &quot;field&quot;), pointing at the possibility that Varsseveld had been an important battleground in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

In 1984, a twenty-five meters tall statue with a Roman helmet on top was erected in celebration of the newly constructed motorway Rijksweg 15, also referring to this story. Historians critiqued the use of the Roman helmet as the idea of Varus having set foot in Varsseveld was highly unlikely and stated that &quot;Varsse&quot; was derived from the word &quot;vaars&quot;, meaning &quot;young cow&quot;. In 2005, a study by the University of Osnabrück proved that it had been impossible for Varus to have fought anywhere near Varsseveld.

Another local belief that aided this urban myth is the existence of a rural road called &quot;Romienendiek&quot; in Aalten. In Low Saxon, &quot;Romienendiek&quot; could translate to &quot;Roman&#x27;s dyke&quot;. However, the road was likely named after &quot;Rooi&#x27;je Mien&quot;, a local folklore figure.

==Sport==
Varsseveld hosted the 2009 Dutch Sidecarcross Grand Prix, on 7 June.

Varsseveld hosted a Strongman contest, the Strongman Champions League Holland Grand Prix on June 1, 2008. The winner of the contest was Žydrūnas Savickas from Lithuania.

Football coach Guus Hiddink and cyclist Robert Gesink were born and raised in Varsseveld.

==Events==

Annual events include:
* Nationale motorcross (May)
* Eeuwig Erbarmen Festival/’n drom (first Saturday in July)
* men-wedstrijden (July)
* Varssevelds Volksfeest (third weekend in August)

<doc id="1060721" wikidata="Q810007" url="?curid=1060721" title="Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms">
<text>Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) is a specification that prescribes a set of low-level routines for performing common linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, linear combinations, and matrix multiplication. They are the &quot;de facto&quot; standard low-level routines for linear algebra libraries; the routines have bindings for both C (&quot;CBLAS interface&quot;) and Fortran (&quot;BLAS interface&quot;). Although the BLAS specification is general, BLAS implementations are often optimized for speed on a particular machine, so using them can bring substantial performance benefits. BLAS implementations will take advantage of special floating point hardware such as vector registers or SIMD instructions.

It originated as a Fortran library in 1979 and its interface was standardized by the BLAS Technical (BLAST) Forum, whose latest BLAS report can be found on the netlib website. This Fortran library is known as the &quot;reference implementation&quot; (sometimes confusingly referred to as &quot;the&quot; BLAS library) and is not optimized for speed but is in the public domain.

Most libraries that offer linear algebra routines conform to the BLAS interface, allowing library users to develop programs that are indifferent to the BLAS library being used.

Many BLAS libraries have been developed, targeting various different hardware platforms. Examples includes cuBLAS (NVIDIA GPU, GPGPU), rocBLAS (AMD GPU), and OpenBLAS. Examples of CPU-based BLAS library branches include: OpenBLAS, BLIS (BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software), Arm Performance Libraries, ATLAS, and Intel Math Kernel Library (iMKL). AMD maintains a fork of BLIS that is optimized for the AMD platform. ATLAS is a portable library that automatically optimizes itself for an arbitrary architecture. iMKL is a freeware and proprietary vendor library optimized for x86 and x86-64 with a performance emphasis on Intel processors. OpenBLAS is an open-source library that is hand-optimized for many of the popular architectures. The LINPACK benchmarks rely heavily on the BLAS routine codice_1 for its performance measurements.

Many numerical software applications use BLAS-compatible libraries to do linear algebra computations, including LAPACK, LINPACK, Armadillo, GNU Octave, Mathematica, MATLAB, NumPy, R, Julia and Lisp-Stat.

==Background==
With the advent of numerical programming, sophisticated subroutine libraries became useful. These libraries would contain subroutines for common high-level mathematical operations such as root finding, matrix inversion, and solving systems of equations. The language of choice was FORTRAN. The most prominent numerical programming library was IBM&#x27;s Scientific Subroutine Package (SSP). These subroutine libraries allowed programmers to concentrate on their specific problems and avoid re-implementing well-known algorithms. The library routines would also be better than average implementations; matrix algorithms, for example, might use full pivoting to get better numerical accuracy. The library routines would also have more efficient routines. For example, a library may include a program to solve a matrix that is upper triangular. The libraries would include single-precision and double-precision versions of some algorithms.

Initially, these subroutines used hard-coded loops for their low-level operations. For example, if a subroutine needed to perform a matrix multiplication, then the subroutine would have three nested loops. Linear algebra programs have many common low-level operations (the so-called &quot;kernel&quot; operations, not related to operating systems). Between 1973 and 1977, several of these kernel operations were identified. These kernel operations became defined subroutines that math libraries could call. The kernel calls had advantages over hard-coded loops: the library routine would be more readable, there were fewer chances for bugs, and the kernel implementation could be optimized for speed. A specification for these kernel operations using scalars and vectors, the level-1 Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS), was published in 1979. BLAS was used to implement the linear algebra subroutine library LINPACK.

The BLAS abstraction allows customization for high performance. For example, LINPACK is a general purpose library that can be used on many different machines without modification. LINPACK could use a generic version of BLAS. To gain performance, different machines might use tailored versions of BLAS. As computer architectures became more sophisticated, vector machines appeared. BLAS for a vector machine could use the machine&#x27;s fast vector operations. (While vector processors eventually fell out of favor, vector instructions in modern CPUs are essential for optimal performance in BLAS routines.)

Other machine features became available and could also be exploited. Consequently, BLAS was augmented from 1984 to 1986 with level-2 kernel operations that concerned vector-matrix operations. Memory hierarchy was also recognized as something to exploit. Many computers have cache memory that is much faster than main memory; keeping matrix manipulations localized allows better usage of the cache. In 1987 and 1988, the level 3 BLAS were identified to do matrix-matrix operations. The level 3 BLAS encouraged block-partitioned algorithms. The LAPACK library uses level 3 BLAS.

The original BLAS concerned only densely stored vectors and matrices. Further extensions to BLAS, such as for sparse matrices, have been addressed.

==Functionality==
BLAS functionality is categorized into three sets of routines called &quot;levels&quot;, which correspond to both the chronological order of definition and publication, as well as the degree of the polynomial in the complexities of algorithms; Level 1 BLAS operations typically take linear time, , Level 2 operations quadratic time and Level 3 operations cubic time. Modern BLAS implementations typically provide all three levels.

===Level 1===
This level consists of all the routines described in the original presentation of BLAS (1979), which defined only &quot;vector operations&quot; on strided arrays: dot products, vector norms, a generalized vector addition of the form

:formula_1

(called &quot;codice_2&quot;, &quot;a x plus y&quot;) and several other operations.

===Level 2===
This level contains &quot;matrix-vector operations&quot; including, among other things, a &quot;ge&quot;neralized &quot;m&quot;atrix-&quot;v&quot;ector multiplication (codice_3):

:formula_2

as well as a solver for in the linear equation

:formula_3

with being triangular. Design of the Level 2 BLAS started in 1984, with results published in 1988. The Level 2 subroutines are especially intended to improve performance of programs using BLAS on vector processors, where Level 1 BLAS are suboptimal &quot;because they hide the matrix-vector nature of the operations from the compiler.&quot;

===Level 3===
This level, formally published in 1990, contains &quot;matrix-matrix operations&quot;, including a &quot;general matrix multiplication&quot; (codice_4), of the form

:formula_4

where and can optionally be transposed or hermitian-conjugated inside the routine, and all three matrices may be strided. The ordinary matrix multiplication can be performed by setting to one and to an all-zeros matrix of the appropriate size.

Also included in Level 3 are routines for computing

:formula_5

where is a triangular matrix, among other functionality.

Due to the ubiquity of matrix multiplications in many scientific applications, including for the implementation of the rest of Level 3 BLAS, and because faster algorithms exist beyond the obvious repetition of matrix-vector multiplication, codice_4 is a prime target of optimization for BLAS implementers. E.g., by decomposing one or both of , into block matrices, codice_4 can be implemented recursively. This is one of the motivations for including the parameter, so the results of previous blocks can be accumulated. Note that this decomposition requires the special case which many implementations optimize for, thereby eliminating one multiplication for each value of . This decomposition allows for better locality of reference both in space and time of the data used in the product. This, in turn, takes advantage of the cache on the system. For systems with more than one level of cache, the blocking can be applied a second time to the order in which the blocks are used in the computation. Both of these levels of optimization are used in implementations such as ATLAS. More recently, implementations by Kazushige Goto have shown that blocking only for the L2 cache, combined with careful amortizing of copying to contiguous memory to reduce TLB misses, is superior to ATLAS. A highly tuned implementation based on these ideas is part of the GotoBLAS, OpenBLAS and BLIS.

A common variation of is the , which calculates a complex product using &quot;three real matrix multiplications and five real matrix additions instead of the conventional four real matrix multiplications and two real matrix additions&quot;, an algorithm similar to Strassen algorithm first described by Peter Ungar.

==Sparse BLAS==
Several extensions to BLAS for handling sparse matrices have been suggested over the course of the library&#x27;s history; a small set of sparse matrix kernel routines was finally standardized in 2002.

==Batched BLAS==
The traditional BLAS functions have been also ported to architectures that support large amounts of parallelism such as GPUs. Here, the traditional BLAS functions provide typically good performance for large matrices. However, when computing e.g., matrix-matrix-products of many small matrices by using the GEMM routine, those architectures show significant performance losses. To address this issue, in 2017 a batched version of the BLAS function has been specified.

Taking the GEMM routine from above as an example, the batched version performs the following computation simultaneously for many matrices:

formula_6

The index formula_7 in square brackets indicates that the operation is performed for all matrices formula_7 in a stack. Often, this operation is implemented for a strided batched memory layout where all matrices follow concatenated in the arrays formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11.

Batched BLAS functions can be a versatile tool and allow e.g. a fast implementation of exponential integrators and Magnus integrators that handle long integration periods with many time steps. Here, the matrix exponentiation, the computationally expensive part of the integration, can be implemented in parallel for all time-steps by using Batched BLAS functions.

<text>Gorredijk () is the largest town in the municipality of Opsterland, in the Dutch province of Friesland. Gorredijk had a population of 7,360 in 2019.

The hamlets of Easterein and Kortezwaag are also part of the town. The latter was an independent village until 1962. Gorredijk and Kortezwaag then formed a double village as Gorredijk-Kortezwaag, but after a few years it was decided to shorten this to Gorredijk, so the older Kortezwaag became a neighborhood of Gorredijk in 1969.

==History==
The runs through the center of Gorredijk. The town is a so-called &quot;vlecke&quot; that was created by peat extraction. In the past, Gorredijk was mainly the place where goods were imported, stored and traded.

A great amount of peat passed through Gorredijk, especially from the area behind Tijnje. There was dire poverty in the region. Jacob van Lennep says the following about it in 1823: &quot;A little further west than the &quot;Heereveen&quot; is the &quot;Gordijcke&quot;, where there still live some half savages or cavemen, whose houses are half underground and who live from robbery and begging. Of the three criminals who are sentenced in Friesland, one is from that place.&quot;

Gorredijk used to look very different. Extensive peat bogs covered southeast Friesland. This peat was later excavated and this &quot;industry&quot; attracted many people to these then sparsely populated areas. The original inhabitants were farmers. They grew buckwheat, oats, rye, peas, beans, flax and herbs. They also kept sheep and bees. Cattle was kept sparingly.

The farmers in the town may have partly obtained their hay from the low countries between Tijnje and Terwispel. They will also have extracted pieces of heather in and near the &quot;Gorrevenen&quot;, which were located in the direction of present-day Jubbega. These &quot;Gorrevenen&quot; were excavated by the &quot;Heren Compagnon&quot; in the seventeenth century. Jonker Dekema in particular had many possessions here. Jonkersland (Jonkerslân) could also have been called &quot;Dekema&#x27;s land&quot;.

A channel was needed to transport peat. This did not exist in 1622, but is mentioned in writing in 1630. The digging of the &quot;Hegedyk&quot; around 1631 is considered the &quot;starting point&quot; of the peat colony &quot;Gordijk&quot;. As there was now a channel to the &quot;Gorrevenen&quot;, the first house was built at the &quot;Hooge wech&quot;, soon followed by others. Over the hole in the dike a Hoogholtje bridge was built, underneath which the peat ships could sail with masts lowered.

==Description==
===&quot;Plaatselijk Belang Gorredijk&quot;===
On 22 November 1880, an organization called &quot;Plaatselijk Belang&quot; () was established to aid the inhabitants of Gorredijk. For example, the local population could borrow money from the organization and &quot;Plaatselijk Belang&quot; involved itself in issues in and around town, such as the connection to the railway network of the . Surviving to the present, the organization remains closely involved and along with local interest groups in neighboring communities, forms a crucial dialog partner of the municipality of Opsterland. The organization periodically consults with the municipal government and informs those interested in current events via its website.

===Education===
Gorredijk is home to three primary schools: &quot;de Treffer&quot;, &quot;Loevestein&quot;, and Protestant Christian school &quot;de Librije&quot;. Secondary education is provided by the &quot;Burgemeester Harmsma School&quot; and most local students look to Heerenveen and Drachten for their tertiary education needs. Museum Opsterlân is also housed in a former school building, which was constructed in 1887 to a design by architect Jacobus Anthonie Meessen and served as a primary school until 1955.

===Town center===
Gorredijk is a center for retail and employment for surrounding communities. The town originated as a linear settlement along the with the most important streets being the &quot;Brouwerswal&quot;, &quot;Kerkewal&quot;, &quot;Molenwal&quot; and &quot;Langewal&quot;. The latter is crossed by the &quot;Hoofdstraat&quot; or main street. Neighborhoods such as &quot;Het Leantsje&quot;, &quot;De Helling&quot; and &quot;De Vlecke&quot; were built in the early 1970s. In the 1980s, streets such as &quot;Spinnerij&quot;, &quot;Brouwerij&quot;, &quot;Wolkammerij&quot;, &quot;Weverij&quot;, &quot;Mouterij&quot; and &quot;Kuperij&quot; were developed. The most recent construction project is the &quot;Loevestein&quot; plan, which has closed significant distance between Gorredijk and the nearby village of Lippenhuizen.

===Market===
From 1694 on, Gorredijk has been given the right to hold a weekly market. The former spring and autumn livestock market also dates back to those days, when cattle left or returned to the barns, respectively. The farmers then brought their butter to the weigh house at the &quot;Boterwaag&quot; and their grains to the commodity market at the &quot;Korenbeurs&quot;. Both currently serve as office buildings. As the town grew, industry kept pace. There have been three shipyards, a rope-making shop and two lime kilns in Gorredijk, though none remain at present. The former village of Kortezwaag had remained a farming community through the centuries.

===Nightlife===
Gorredijk had a dance hall in the 1970s, but the venue was shuttered alongside a music club on the industrial estate. Most youngsters from the town go out in Heerenveen, Drachten, Groningen or Zevenhuizen and Marum. Local pubs attract a small but regular audience. At the beginning of 1900 there were more than 100 &quot;living room bars&quot; in Gorredijk and the town brewed its own spirits: &quot;&quot; Beerenburg and jenever. The &quot;Gerard Brons&quot; brand still exists, but is now brewed by Boomsma distillery in Leeuwarden.

==Religion==
Although Gorredijk has the pretense of being a &quot;red&quot; socialist town—Domela Nieuwenhuis came from the area—it has a number of church communities. There is a Catholic Church, a Protestant congregation, a Mennonite community, and a Kingdom Hall of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Gorredijk has had its own Dutch Reformed Church since 1683. In 1896, a church bell from the town was put up for sale, which can now be found in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Dated to the 12th century, it is unknown where this bell saw use.

Gorredijk has a rich Jewish past. There was a synagogue and a Jewish school. In the 1880s the Jewish family De Haan, with the then very young future authors Jacob Israël and Carry, lived there for a few years. Only a handful of Jews survived World War II. In a meadow towards Jubbega one can still find a historic Jewish cemetery.

During the war it was relatively quiet in Gorredijk, although there were quite a few people in the resistance in one way or another. On the eve of the liberation, there was a shooting near the draw bridge in the main street, which is now named after the fallen resistance fighter Gerke Numan. In the vicinity of the town, as elsewhere in Friesland, there were many hiding places. During the occupation, a number of Allied aircraft were shot down in the area, of which a crew of six from a British Vickers Wellington bomber are buried in the local graveyard.

==Sports and recreation==
Sports clubs in Gorredijk include football association VV Gorredijk and korfball association LDODK. In addition, the town has a volleyball association &quot;Reva&quot;, rugby association &quot;De Wrotters&quot;, gymnastics association &quot;Stânfries&quot;, a tennis association, and an outdoor swimming pool.

<text>Samuel Grosvenor Wood (July 10, 1883 – September 22, 1949) was an American film director and producer who is best known for having directed such Hollywood hits as &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, and &quot;&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;&quot; and for his uncredited work directing parts of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. He was also involved in a few acting and writing projects.

As a youth, Wood developed an enthusiasm for physical fitness that persisted into his senior years and influenced his interest in making sports-themed films.

Wood advanced from making largely competent yet routine pictures in the 1920s and 1930s to directing several highly regarded works during the 1940s at the peak of his abilities, among them &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942) and &quot;Ivy&quot; (1947).

Wood&#x27;s quick, efficient and professional execution of his film assignments endeared him to studio executives, and though not a &quot;brilliant&quot; director, Wood&#x27;s legacy represents &quot;a long and respectable film career.&quot;
==Early life and family==

Samuel Grosvenor Wood was born on July 10, 1883, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to William Henry Wood and Katherine (née Corn) Wood. He attended M. Hall Stanton School. One of Wood&#x27;s daughters, born Gloria Wood, was film and television actress K.T. Stevens.

Spent time in Summers around 1900 on the Atlantic City beach with friends.

==Early career in Hollywood==

When Wood turned 18 years old in the summer of 1901, he and a companion began a year-long trek across the United States, ultimately arriving in Los Angeles, where Wood embarked on a successful career as a real estate broker. By 1906, the then-primitive film industry in Southern California enticed Wood to gain entrée into the nascent industry by acting, adopting the screen name &quot;Chad Applegate.&quot; He carefully concealed his (then regarded) ill-reputed avocation from real estate associates and clients.

In 1908, Wood married Clara Louise Roush, who encouraged her spouse to commit to a career in film. Spurred by a collapse in the real estate market, Wood obtained work as a movie production assistant and, by 1914, was serving as an assistant director to Cecil B. DeMille. During the next five years, Wood contributed to the manufacture of hundreds of movies shorts as an assistant director, mostly for Paramount Pictures.

==Directorial debut: The Wallace Reid films, 1920==

At the end of 1919, Wood won his first assignment as director in the Paramount feature &quot;Double Speed&quot;, the first of five films he was paired with screen star Wallace Reid, all of which were filmed and released in 1920. Wood demonstrated efficient and effective direction that made him attractive to Paramount executives. The success of these hour-long action comedies were highly praised by production head Jesse Lasky for their &quot;assembly line&quot; output and profitability.

Actor Reid, injured during a shoot in 1919, suffered from chronic pain that he treated with morphine. (A functioning addict during his collaboration with Wood, he would die in 1923 at the age of 32 due to complications related to his addiction.)

Despite the outstanding success of his Reid features, Wood expressed a desire to work on other projects. Paramount, &quot;perhaps as a sign of displeasure&quot; obliged Wood by demoting him to their subsidiary movie unit, Realart, a venue for the production of low-budget &quot;routine programme pictures&quot; that offered little in the way of substance. Wood endured the assignment, making four films at Realart, starring Ethel Clayton and Wanda Hawley, all filmed in 1920. Wood&#x27;s perseverance at Realart earned him a reputation as a reliable studio asset.

==The Swanson-Wood pictures, 1921-1923==


Paramount&#x27;s appreciation for Wood&#x27;s &quot;fast, efficient&quot; delivery of film products and his excellent rapport with his cast and crew landed him the honor of directing their recently acquired actor Gloria Swanson in her first starring vehicle, &quot;The Great Moment&quot; (1921). DeMille, whom Wood had served as an assistant director from 1914 to 1916, and Swanson, a close personal friend to Wood, each influenced Paramount&#x27;s choice.

With the popular success of &quot;The Great Moment&quot;, co-starring Milton Sills (in one scandalous scene, he sucks rattlesnake venom from Swanson&#x27;s chest) Paramount proceeded to finance nine more Swanson-Wood collaborations over the next two years, beginning with &quot;Under the Lash&quot; (1921) and finishing with &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s 8th Wife&quot; (1923). Cameraman Alfred Gilks photographed all ten of the productions. During the Wood-Swanson series of films &quot;the costume department broke all records for Hollywood lavishness...&quot;

Wood&#x27;s pictures included an array of scenarios and settings, providing abundant opportunities for Swanson and her leading men to &quot;besport themselves in a variety of period costumes&quot; (e.g. &quot;Beyond the Rocks&quot; (1922) with Rudolf Valentino), and to appear in the &quot;daring modern clothing&quot; of the Jazz Age (e.g. &quot;Prodigal Daughters&quot; (1923) with Ralph Graves). Swanson&#x27;s silent film career was significantly enhanced by these Wood productions. However, In 1923 by mutual consent, Swanson and Wood agreed to conclude their collaboration.

Sam Wood and Swanson &quot;had clearly found the formula for success in these romantic comedies of marriage and intrigue laced with a series of handsome leading men and a never-ending parade of fabulous gowns.&quot;

==Principal Pictures and Irving M. Lesser, 1924-1925==

In late 1923, Wood&#x27;s relationship with Paramount began deteriorating due to his discontent over the quality of his project assignments. Wood completed the &quot;heavy-handed morality tale&quot; &quot;His Children&#x27;s Children&quot; at the end of 1923, and only made &quot;Bluff&quot; (1924) with Agnes Ayers under protest due to his low appraisal of Ayers&#x27; star potential.

Wood accepted two offers from producer Irving &quot;Sol&quot; Lesser of the newly formed Principal Pictures to make &quot;a most unusual film&quot;, &quot;The Female&quot; (1924), set in the South African Veld starring Betty Compson, as well as a Western and Wood&#x27;s first effort in this genre, &quot;The Mine with the Iron Door&quot; (1924) with Dorothy Mackaill. Wood consented to make another film with Dorothy Mackaill for Paramount in &quot;The Next Corner&quot; (1924) that despite its &quot;expensive production values&quot; was burdened with a &quot;meager plot&quot;. Wood and Paramount reached an impasse when he refused to direct another Agnes Ayers vehicle. Wood was officially suspended from Paramount and the other major studios for a year.

Sol Lesser at Principal Pictures reached out to Wood to direct a film version of novelist Harold Bell Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Re-Creation of Brian Kent&quot;, a soap opera. When Wood&#x27;s adaptation proved a box office success, Paramount executives sought to lure Wood back to the studio, bestowing on him a lavishly financed production, &quot;Fascinating Youth&quot; (1926). Wood completed the &quot;light comedy&quot; but remained convinced that he had no future with Paramount and successfully arranged for a release from his contract.

Wood&#x27;s separation from Paramount proved to be fortuitous for the director. Indeed, it was &quot;a major turning point in his career.&quot; In 1927, he briefly directed films for Cole-Robertson Pictures, a small Boston outfit, and simultaneously negotiated a long-term commitment to Hollywood&#x27;s dominant studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M-G-M).

==Harold &quot;Red&quot; Grange and the Cole-Robertson Pictures, 1926-1927==

Robertson-Cole Pictures (soon to be the Film Booking Company, F.B.O and later associated with RKO Radio Studios) instantly picked up the now available Wood. Production manager Joseph P. Kennedy had famous sports hero &quot;Red&quot; Grange under contract and Wood, a gridiron enthusiast, welcomed the opportunity to deliver a compelling football story, &quot;One Minute to Play&quot; (1926). Wood directed Grange a second time in a small epic honoring horse racing. Emphasizing the virtues of the sport rather than the less than impressive acting performance by Grange, &quot;A Racing Romeo&quot; (1927), completed Wood&#x27;s duties for Cole-Robertson.

==Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M-G-M), 1927-1939==

Wood&#x27;s first two assignments for M-G-M, &quot;Rookies&quot;, with Karl Dane and George K. Arthur, and &quot;The Fair Co-Ed&quot; with Marion Davies were comedies, both made in 1927, earning him a long-term contract with the studio for whom he would almost exclusively make films for over ten years.

Wood proceeded to bring his signature speed and efficiency to M-G-M, directing their top stars and supplied with screenplays &quot;of the slimmest material&quot;: Norma Shearer in &quot;The Latest from Paris&quot; (1928), William Haines in &quot;Telling the World&quot; (1928), the Duncan Sisters (1929) in &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; and in his first sound film in 1929, introduced actor Robert Montgomery.

Wood was renowned for consistently delivering his features &quot;on time and on budget&quot;, but these virtues, which pleased the Front Office, &quot;militated against his getting worthier assignments.&quot;
Two more comedies followed in 1930, &quot;The Girl Said No&quot; and &quot;They Learned About Women&quot;, the latter with a baseball theme and a sentimental vehicle starring German actor Louis Mann in a fine performance, and with co-star Robert Montgomery.

Wood directed silent matinee idol John Gilbert in a maritime romance-adventure &quot;Way for a Sailor&quot;, a vehicle that the actor hoped would redeem his reputation in the emerging &quot;talkies&quot;. Gilbert was poorly cast as a tough seaman opposite Wallace Beery. Legend has it that M-G-M&#x27;s studio chief Louis B. Mayer was complicit in miscasting Gilbert in a virile role that did not suit his image, and Wood failed to salvage his performance. Concentrating on action scenes depicting high seas shipwrecks and rescues, Wood invested &quot;Way for the Sailor&quot; with no more than a measure of realism.

Silent movie flapper and rising talkie star Joan Crawford was paired with Wood for &quot;Paid&quot; (1930), a crime drama that benefited from Wood&#x27;s &quot;taut&quot; execution and Charles Rosher&#x27;s cinematography,

Wood followed with two less fortunate assignments and the last two of the four features he would make with William Haines: &quot;A Tailor Made Man&quot; and &quot;New Adventures of Get Rich Quick Wallingford&quot;, both 1931. Haines would subsequently retire from acting to become a successful interior decorator. Wood finished off the year by directing his final and successful film with Robert Montgomery, &quot;The Man in Possession&quot;, a &quot;knockabout comedy.&quot;

===Ramon Novarro: &quot;Huddle&quot; and &quot;The Barbarian&quot;, 1932-1933===

The 1932 &quot;Huddle&quot; was another opportunity for Wood to demonstrate his talent for presenting American collegiate football. Madge Evans appears opposite leading man Ramon Novarro, a silent era star who struggled to make the transition to sound films.

In a bid to revitalize Novarro&#x27;s career, M-G-M tasked Wood with filming a remake of the &quot;romantic-exotic&quot; silent era success &quot;The Arab,&quot; originally filmed by director Cecil B DeMille in 1915 starring Edgar Selwyn, and in 1924, starring the then 25-year old Navarro, both carrying the same title. Wood remade &quot;The Barbarian&quot; with emerging film star Myrna Loy as the object of Novarro&#x27;s affection, who steals her from fiancé Reginald Denny in this cinematic ally &quot;attractive minor package&quot;.

===&quot;Prosperity&quot; (1932) and &quot;Christopher Bean&quot; (1933): Marie Dressler===

A former star in stage and Vaudeville, the 62-year-old Marie Dressler and co-star Wallace Beery scored a huge financial success for M-G-M, with the 1930 Min and Bill, directed by George Hill, earning her an Academy Award for Best Actress. Wood directed Dressler in this fast-paced light comedy &quot;Prosperity&quot; (1933), about a small-town bank president (Dressler) who spars with her provincial neighbors and patrons. Wood was reunited with Dressler in 1933 to make &quot;Christopher Bean&quot;, a light burlesque on the humorous aspects of greed.

===&quot;Hold Your Man&quot; (1933): Jean Harlow and Clark Gable===

Wood served as both producer and director on &quot;Hold Your Man&quot;, a dual role that he did not relish within the &quot;assembly-line&quot; organization that prevailed in the major studios of the 1930s.
The assignment, however, was a promotion for Wood, providing him with the opportunity to make a crime-romance that is &quot;sentimental, cheeky, wise-cracking&quot; and as always &quot;swiftly paced&quot; and featuring two of M-G-M&#x27;s top stars of the period, Jean Harlow and Clark Gable.

After finishing his two Dressler features, Wood made the second of his three films with Myrna Loy, &quot;Stamboul Quest&quot; (1934), a spy-romance set in Turkish Dardanelles during World War I. Loy plays a Mata Hari-like character pursued by counter-spies and her devoted swain George Brent. Wood enjoyed the services of James Wong Howe&#x27;s expert cinematography.
During Wood&#x27;s decade-long tenure with M-G-M, he made only one film for another studio, Edward Small&#x27;s Reliance studios. &quot;Let &#x27;Em Have It&quot; (1935) stars Richard Arlen in an Underworld vs. G-man themed story that Wood attempted to add substance by including sequences describing U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s modern crime-fighting methodology.

==Irving Thalberg and The Marx Brothers, 1935-1937==

In 1935, Irving Thalberg, the highly regarded head of production at M-G-M, hired the comedy team The Marx Brothers, who had made five career-defining movies at Paramount Pictures, but whose dispute with Paramount over unpaid monies as well as the tepid box office of their now-classic &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933) resulted in their five-picture contract not being renewed. Thalberg, in offering them a film contract with M-G-M, demanded a significant degree of control over every aspect of the project. To this the Marx Brothers acquiesced. Zeppo Marx had left the team in 1934 to focus on other business ventures, leaving a trio consisting of Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx.

Thalberg&#x27;s decision to approach Wood to direct the Marx Brothers would mark a &quot;turning point&quot; in the director&#x27;s professional career. Now in his late forties and &quot;largely undistinguished&quot; during the silent era (though exhibiting &quot;unexpected moments of genius&quot;) Wood was regarded as one of M-G-M&#x27;s &quot;top men.&quot;

===A Comedy Magnum Opus: &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; (1935)===
Initially skeptical about undertaking &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, Thalberg assured Wood that a coherent film structure would be imposed to incorporate love interests and musical numbers, alternating with the Marx Brothers&#x27; comedy creations. Wood&#x27;s masterful control over the screenplay and cast served to integrate these elements into the film. Historian John Baxter observes that:

Wood&#x27;s &quot;perfectionist&quot; approach to shooting &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; involved daily reviews of the footage and editing the scenes, a process that guaranteed reshoots that &quot;endangered the spontaneity of the humor.&quot; Wood&#x27;s often tedious approach to re-filming key Marx Brothers scenes placed a strain on cast and crew that Wood addressed with good-natured blandishments.

The enormous success of &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; ensured that a sequel would be made, but Thalberg had declared a temporary moratorium in order to increase interest in the public for the anticipated feature. Wood was designated in advance as its director.

While M-G-M planned the next Marx Brothers comedy epic, Wood was occupied with a two-picture assignment. The first was &quot;Whipsaw&quot; (1936), a romance-crime drama with Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy. The shooting included a brief clash between Wood and Tracy, the actor rebelling against the director for being &quot;too meticulous&quot;. Wood&#x27;s second effort was a &quot;slick and glossy melodrama&quot; with &quot;M-G-M&#x27;s stylish trimmings&quot; with Loretta Young and Franchot Tone and a fine supporting cast: &quot;The Unguarded Hour&quot; (1936).

===&quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937)===


The Marx Brothers arrived for the filming of &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; having tested new routines at burlesque venues, and Thalberg and Wood were prepared to use this material to emulate the profitability of &quot;A Night At the Opera&quot;. Shortly into the filming, Thalberg unexpectedly died, at thirty-seven, from pneumonia, a loss that left Wood personally shaken. Wood proceeded with the picture, adhering to the formula that balanced the &quot;romance and musical numbers&quot; with the fulsome humor offered in the Marx Brothers sequences.

==Final years at M-G-M, 1937-1938==
After the success of his two Marx Brothers features, Wood requested and was awarded more substantial stories and scripts from M-G-M. Wood furnished the studio with &quot;good pieces of entertainment&quot; in his next four works &quot;but nothing memorable&quot;.

&quot;Navy Blue and Gold&quot; (1937): Here Wood returned to collegiate athletics, endowing this &quot;light comedy&quot; - starring James Stewart, Robert Young and Tom Brown—with a &quot;rousing&quot; Army-Navy football game. Florence Rice provides the love interest.

&quot;Madame X&quot; (1937): A popular stage play by Alexandre Bisson that enjoyed numerous film adaptations until 1966, Wood directed Gladys George as the long-suffering mother who sacrifices for her children. Biographer Tony Thomas reports that the actress was one of the rare cases in which Wood developed a personal dislike for a player.

&quot;Lord Jeff&quot; (1938): A sentimental tale of orphan boys preparing for an apprenticeship in the British navy. Popular child actor Freddy Bartholomew undergoes correction by an older fellow orphan Mickey Rooney, with assistance from Peter Lawford.

&quot;Stablemates&quot; (1938): In Rooney&#x27;s second appearance in a Wood film, a &quot;race-track waif&quot; he reforms the alcoholic yet good-hearted horse veterinarian Wallace Beery. Wood, in his handling of these inherently sentimental vehicles, avoids descending into &quot;bathos&quot;, a temptation that &quot;he avoided in all his films.&quot;

During the next 10 years until his death in 1949, Wood would direct and produce his most substantial work as one of Hollywood&#x27;s major filmmakers.

===&quot;Raffles&quot; (1939) and Samuel Goldwyn Productions===

A perennial favorite among filmmakers since 1904, &quot;Raffles&quot; is based on the popular short story &quot;The Amateur Cracksman&quot; (1899) by E.W. Hornung and filmed by director King Baggot in 1925, and Harry D&#x27;Arrast and George Fitzmaurice in 1930. Wood made the film while loaned out to Sam Goldwyn for this production.

Raffles&#x27; stars Olivia de Havilland and debuts David Niven as the gentleman jewel thief who good-naturedly thwarts Scotland Yard. Wood, like a number of his fellow directors, among them King Vidor, suffered from Goldwyn&#x27;s intrusiveness on the set.

===&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939)===

The film rights to British novelist James Hilton&#x27;s popular novelette &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; were obtained by M-G-M&#x27;s Irving Thalberg after literary critic Alexander Woollcott&#x27;s praise for the work helped popularize it in the United States. Wood traveled to England to make &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, the only professional sojourn of his career, part of an attempt by M-G-M to accommodate demands by British trade unions for a share of the lucrative American film exports market.

The novel spans the life of an English school master (Robert Donat) whose lonely and inhibited existence is transformed through the love of his understanding spouse (Greer Garson) into a good-natured pedagogue beloved by generations of his students. Wood&#x27;s direction of Donat was painstaking in its precision, a role that required the actor to portray his character in youth and old age (in four stages, at twenty-four, forty, sixty-four and eighty-three years of age). Wood demonstrated his restraint in telling the inherently touching tale convincingly without lapsing into sentimentality.

Actress Greer Garson made her Hollywood debut with &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;. Just days before &quot;the still uncast&quot; actress was to return to Great Britain after M-G-M had withdrawn her film option, Wood by chance saw her screen test and quickly informed M-G-M that he wanted her to play the role of Katherine.

&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; won Donat a Best Actor Oscar, and Wood received the first of his three Academy Award nominations for Best Director. Upon his return from England, Wood determined he would end his long association with M-G-M, confident that he could thrive by offering his services independently to any of the major studios.

===&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939)===

Wood&#x27;s parting assignment under M-G-M was to take over the filming of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; when the director Victor Fleming collapsed during shooting and did not return to the studio for a month. The film epic was based on Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s popular novel set during the American Civil War. Fleming received screen credit for directing the film, though the precise contribution by Wood, as well as that of several other contributors, including George Cukor, Leslie Howard, David O. Selznick, and William Wellman has not been fully documented. A number of uncredited cinematographers also shared in making the picture, among them Joseph Ruttenberg, Wilfred Cline and Lee Garmes, who often worked &quot;at first units located on widely separated locations&quot;.

Other than overseeing the vast operations at the movie&#x27;s multiple venues, Wood with certainty filmed the entire sequence where Scarlett O&#x27;Hara (Vivien Leigh) shoots a Yankee bummer (Paul Hurst) who broke into the plantation household. Wood also personally handled some of the scenes that depict wounded Confederate troops at the Atlanta train depot. Whatever way the attributions are allocated, the collective efforts of the cast and crew produced &quot;a remarkable film.&quot;

==&quot;Our Town&quot; (1940)==

Now operating as an independent agent, Wood was instantly offered the option by his former associate and producer Irving &quot;Sol&quot; Lesser to adapt Thornton Wilder&#x27;s play &quot;Our Town&quot;. Wilder&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play had first been staged on Broadway in 1938, and was &quot;not the kind of vehicle that 1940 Hollywood would have been expected to produce&quot;, but Lesser was determined to bring the &quot;unusual&quot; qualities of the work faithfully to the screen.

Wilder worked closely with both Wood and Lesser to help preserve the qualities of the stage production by retaining narrator Frank Craven, who on-screen observes the lives of two rural families in New Hampshire near the turn of the 20th century. Lesser and Wood convinced Wilder to permit one major alteration in his allegorical play: Emily Webb, played by Martha Scott, does not die in childbirth, but only in a dream sequence, a re-write that Wilder admitted was preferable in a cinematic treatment of his work. The atmosphere of the picture was enhanced by the simplicity of the scenery conceived by set designer William Cameron Menzies and by the haunting musical score by American composer Aaron Copland. The excellent supporting cast, including Fay Bainter, Beulah Bondi, Thomas Mitchell and Guy Kibbee contributed to &quot;Our Town&quot; nomination for the Best Picture Oscar.

===&quot;Kitty Foyle&quot; (1940): Ginger Rogers===

Based on a Christopher Morley story entitled &quot;Kitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman&quot;, Ginger Rogers plays the working class protagonist who struggles to choose between two men in a love triangle.

Wood approached the filming of &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot; with immense care, delineating camera orientation, a precise script and &quot;notes on interpretation&quot; to achieve the &quot;utmost clarity.&quot; However implausible the narrative of the love story, Wood maintained his signature control that balances the film&#x27;s &quot;tenderness and intelligence&quot; with a firmness of direction that avoids sentimentality. The director was emphatic in his disdain for over-acting: &quot;I find [over-acting] unforgivable because it destroys realism. I don&#x27;t allow scenery chewing while emoting.&quot; Wood received the second of his three Academy Award Best Director nominations for Kitty Foyle and a nomination for Best Picture. Ginger Rogers won for Best Actress.

Wood returned to Paramount Pictures to make an action-packed Western that borders on a burlesque of the genre, &quot;Rangers of Fortune&quot; (1940). Starring Fred MacMurray and Gilbert Roland with supporting cast Albert Dekker and Betty Brewer. The madcap escapades of these desperadoes stop short of &quot;buffoonery&quot; when Wood applies his story-telling skills to assert his &quot;sense of balance...one of the most valuable assets&quot; that Wood possessed as a filmmaker.

===&quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot; (1941): Jean Arthur, RKO Pictures===

Wood opted for RKO Pictures to film Norman Krasner&#x27;s original screenplay &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot;, a comedy starring Jean Arthur and Charles Coburn. Frank Ross, Jr., Arthur&#x27;s husband, produced the picture. The stars delivered superb performances in a &quot;social satire&quot; that pits a department store saleswoman-cum-strike organizer (Arthur) against the Scrooge-like owner (Coburn). As with most of Wood&#x27;s work, consistency, pace and balance characterized his expert handling of the story and script.

==A collaborative masterpiece: &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942), Warner Brothers==

After a protracted struggle to formulate a screenplay satisfactory to censors at the Hays Office, Wood and Warner Brothers commenced to film Henry Bellamann&#x27;s grim and anti-nostalgic novel of American small-town life, &quot;Kings Row&quot;.

Wood&#x27;s &quot;discipline as a story-teller&quot; was essential in conveying to the screen &quot;Kings Row&quot;&#x27;s &quot;troubling message without sacrificing its integrity.&quot;

The high quality of Wood&#x27;s directorial performance was augmented by three of Hollywood&#x27;s finest professionals in their fields: set designer William Cameron Menzies, cinematographer James Wong Howe and composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold, collectively creating a film of &quot;classical proportions.&quot;

Biographer Tony Thomas offers this appraisal:

===&quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942): Sam Goldwyn and RKO===
When beloved baseball player Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees died, aged thirty-seven in 1941 of ALS, a fatal neuromuscular disorder, Wood determined that a film biography was in order. The career of the &quot;modest and likable&quot; Gehrig spanned 17 years (1923–1939), during which he played more than two thousand consecutive games. Though Gehrig was idolized by his fans, Wood met with resistance from studio executives to a project that was likely to appeal to only half of the American demographic: male sports fans. Wood, an ardent sports enthusiast, was able to sway producer Sam Goldwyn to sponsor the film, and they both agreed that the picture would be an &quot;ideal vehicle&quot; for Gary Cooper, &quot;a kind of idealization of the American male&quot;, and significantly, under contract to Goldwyn.

An avid outdoorsman, Cooper was virtually ignorant of baseball as a professional sport, but complied with his contract. Wood&#x27;s encouragement and support for Cooper served to create a satisfactory portrayal of Gehrig, matching &quot;the perfect actor with the perfect director&quot; and assuring the film&#x27;s success.

While filming on set, Wood was initially dismayed at what at first appeared to be Cooper&#x27;s inept acting. Upon reviewing the actual footage, Wood was relieved and pleased to discover that Cooper&#x27;s &quot;underplaying&quot; translated effectively to the screen.

Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, and the film earned nine more nominations, including Best Picture. &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; remains &quot;one of the best and most popular screen biographies as well as the quintessential baseball movie.&quot;

Even as Wood was filming &quot;Kings Row&quot; for Warner Brothers in 1941, he began working on his major project for Paramount: an adaption of novelist Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Wood proceeded to shoot numerous landscape scenes in the Sierra Nevada mountain range before the cast for the movie had been selected. Production on the film was set aside while Wood made &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;; only when that project was completed did he return to &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.

==&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), Paramount Pictures==

Wood&#x27;s 1943 &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; was &quot;the major project of [his] career.&quot; Adapting Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s Spanish Civil War epic had a personal and political significance to Wood, identifying as he did with Hemingway&#x27;s idealistic protagonist Robert Jordan and the Republican cause for which he fought.

Paramount Pictures&#x27; casting of the doomed hero was a foregone conclusion, as the book&#x27;s author, Hemingway, had his friend and actor Gary Cooper in mind as Robert Jordan when he conceived the story. Cooper was conveniently already under contract with the studio. Wood was obliged to complete &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942) before he could commit himself fully to &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, already under production since late 1941.

Wood favored ballet dancer and actress Vera Zorina for the role of the young guerrilla fighter, Maria, an opinion that was at odds with Hemingway as well as members of &quot;Wood&#x27;s own family.&quot; During shooting on location, Wood realized his error when Zorina did not take to the part, and Ingrid Bergman, who had coveted the role, was auditioned after completing her role as Ilsa Lund in director Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), and winning &quot;the coveted role.&quot;

Audiences and critics felt &quot;the love interest was over-played&quot; in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; at the expense of clarifying the political issues that defined the Spanish Civil War: a brutal and violent struggle between fascist and anti-fascist forces.

Wood was undoubtedly disappointed when &quot;the major project of his career&quot; did not garner him an Academy Award nomination, an honor that was bestowed on his cinematographer Ray Rennahan, his set designer William Cameron Menzies, musical director Victor Young and his four leading cast members, with Katina Paxinou winning Best Supporting Actress in her role as the revolutionary matron Pilar.

Filmed shortly after the United States entered World War II, the government placed wartime limits on Hollywood&#x27;s access to new building materials. To obviate these restrictions, Wood chose to do most of the filming outdoors at the picturesque Sonora Pass in the Sierra Nevada. Wood recalled the ordeal of filming &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;:

Though &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; did not achieve the critical success that Paramount had anticipated, Bergman and Cooper, who recognized the potential of their film pairing, followed Wood to Warner Brothers to star in a Western romance, &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; (1945).

===&quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; (1943, released 1945), Warner Brothers===

Warner Brothers sought to exploit the &quot;exciting potential&quot; of a Bergman-Cooper pairing in &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; (1945), an &quot;expensive and lavish&quot; production that did not live up to expectations. (The &quot;Trunk&quot; refers to the Saratoga Trunk Line, owned by a railway baron played by John Warburton) Though filmed in early 1943, the picture was not given general release until early 1945, initially presented only to U.S. servicemen stationed overseas during the war.

Wood&#x27;s direction of &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; lacked his characteristic celerity and its &quot;languid&quot; tempo earned the film only an &quot;admirable but dull&quot; rating by critics, despite its &quot;rich production values.&quot; The director of Hollywood&#x27;s Production Code Administration, Joseph Breen, registered some distaste for the characterization of Clio Dulaine (Ingrid Bergman) as a mixed-race (half-Creole) courtesan who seeks matrimony with wealthy white gamblers and capitalists. The only acting Academy Award nomination went to British actress Flora Robson, who wore blackface makeup to portray the mulatto servant Angelique Buiton.

A commercial failure, &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; did not diminish the mutual esteem which Cooper and Wood held for each other. Their next feature was decidedly not of the epic-heroic proportions of their three previous collaborations, but a light comedy: &quot;Casanova Brown&quot;.

===Three comedies: &quot;Casanova Brown&quot;, &quot;Guest Wife&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot;: 1944-1946===

Wood continued his collaboration with Cooper in a comedic vein after the delayed release of &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; with International Pictures&#x27; &quot;Casanova Brown&quot; (1944), a vehicle intended to appeal to female movie patrons. Cooper absconds with his own infant daughter from a maternity ward in order to prevent his former wife offering the child up for adoption. Wood&#x27;s situation comedy was no more than a moderate success. 
Wood followed with &quot;Guest Wife&quot; (1946) starring Claudette Colbert and RKO&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (1946) starring Ginger Rogers.

A cinematic &quot;trifle&quot; largely carried by the virtues of star Colbert, &quot;Guest Wife&quot; also benefits from Wood&#x27;s expert handling of his cast, &quot;a talent in itself.&quot; Biographer Tony Thomas summarizes Wood&#x27;s approach to controlling his actors:

Wood rejoined Ginger Rogers after their success in the romance &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot; (1940) to film a remake of French director Henri Decoin&#x27;s 1939 &quot;Battement de coeur&quot;, in &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. The Dickensian theme features Rogers as an Oliver Twist-like character who enlists to serve the Fagin-like figure (Basil Rathbone) as a pickpocket. The picture would have been better served if Wood possessed &quot;the sly touch of a Guitry or a Lubitsch&quot; rather than Wood&#x27;s obvious humor.

==A &quot;Gaslight Noir&quot;: &quot;Ivy&quot; (1947), Universal-International Pictures==

Based on a short story by Marie Belloc Lowndes set during Great Britain&#x27;s Edwardian era, this 1947 melodrama is considered by some critics, but not universally, to be &quot;a minor cinematic masterpiece.&quot; Wood&#x27;s crime-noir stars Joan Fontaine as the &quot;ruthless&quot; and scheming social climber whose homicidal deed leads to her sordid demise.

&quot;Ivy&quot; was essentially a collaborative effort between director Wood and producer and renowned set designer William Cameron Menzies, who also served as producer on the picture. Wood and Menzies had worked splendidly on a number of projects including &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), &quot;Our Town&quot; (1940) and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943). The fine rendering of the British upper-class milieu is attributed largely to the uncredited Menzies, although screen credit went to Richard H. Riedel.

Photographed &quot;lovingly&quot; by cameraman Russell Metty, Fontaine&#x27;s Orry-Kelly wardrobe reduced the actress to a &quot;gorgeous artifact&quot; and she complained later that director Wood neglected to develop the potential dramatic complexities of her character.

Biographer Tony Thomas sums of Wood&#x27;s directorial effort on &quot;Ivy&quot;:

===&quot;Command Decision&quot; (1949), M-G-M===

An adaption of the William Wister Haines World War II drama published in 1947, Wood&#x27;s portrayal of the &quot;anguish of wartime aviation command&quot; is &quot;unembellished&quot; by any combat footage and shows fidelity to the novel of the same name.

The film&#x27;s depictions of the military establishment during wartime balances &quot;the devious expediency and opportunism&quot; inherent to high command with &quot;the heroism and heartfelt concern among various militarists and politicians.&quot; The film&#x27;s scenario offered Wood the ideal platform on which to demonstrate his &quot;thoroughly masculine and no-nonsense style of filmmaking&quot; delivered by an all-male cast who represented officers and men from the U.S. Army Eighth Army Air Corps, played by Clark Gable, Van Johnson, Walter Pidgeon, Brian Donlevy and Charles Bickford. Biographer Tony Thomas describes the picture as &quot;fairly honest in revealing the almost dehumanizing function of operating a modern war machine.&quot;

A key sequence from the film, developed specifically for Clark Gable (who served as an air force combat officer during the war) and well-executed by Wood, portrays his character, Brigadier General K.C. Dennis, in his dramatic &quot;talking down&quot; of a crippled Flying Fortress attempting to land.

===Sports biography redux: &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; (1949), M-G-M===

Wood returned to his sports &quot;métier&quot; when he was tasked with directing the story of Chicago White Sox major league pitcher Monty Stratton. One of baseball&#x27;s youngest and foremost pitchers, Stratton lost a leg to amputation after a hunting accident aged 26. Director Wood expertly recounted the athlete&#x27;s struggle to adapt to the use of a prosthetic and return to professional baseball in the minor leagues. An inherently &quot;maudlin&quot; tale, Wood presented the events without succumbing to sentimentality: &quot;it told a true story, and kept to the facts…&quot;

Actors Van Johnson and Gregory Peck were considered for the role of Monty Stratton, but M-G-M settled on James Stewart, the actor Stratton himself felt would portray his life most effectively.

Contrary to conventional wisdom among Hollywood studio executives that sports features were &quot;box-office poison&quot;, &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; was &quot;the sixth-biggest theatrical draw of 1949 and Stewart&#x27;s first &quot;bona fide&quot; hit since his return from World War II.&quot;

===&quot;Ambush&quot; (1950), M-G-M===
Sam Wood&#x27;s directorial swan song was the adventure Western &quot;Ambush&quot;, filmed in 1949 and released in 1950 after Wood&#x27;s unexpected death from a heart attack. A &quot;Grade A&quot; M-G-M production, it starred Robert Taylor as a hardened US Army Indian fighter and companion John Hodiak and adversary Chief Thundercloud:

When Wood was arranging a production of &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot;, a Margaret Sullavan vehicle for Columbia Pictures, he was suddenly stricken by a heart attack on September 22, 1949, and died a few hours later in hospital.

==Political beliefs==

Wood became a committed and ardent anti-Communist in the years that saw the rise of McCarthyism in the late 1940s. Wood first exhibited this political perspective in 1943, when he reduced much of the anti-fascist content of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, saying &quot;It would be the same love story if they were on the other side.&quot; In 1944, he founded and served as the first president of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an organization that was &quot;dedicated to seeking out and expelling those people it considered traitorous to American interests.&quot;

The organization, &quot;formed of management and labor in the film industry,&quot; quietly lobbied the House Un-American Activities Committee to examine purported Communist elements in the movie industry, which they did in 1947. Wood had been keeping a black notebook in which he wrote the names of those he considered subversive. His daughter Jeane Wood said that his crusade &quot;transformed Dad into a snarling, unreasoning brute.&quot; There was nothing in Wood&#x27;s personal and professional demeanor during the course of his long career that anticipated the intensity of his anti-Communist rage which &quot;disappointed some of his friends and greatly concerned his family.&quot;

Wood was a charter member of the Hollywood Republican Committee.

Shortly following a 1949 meeting of his Motion Picture Alliance in which he had protested against a liberal screenwriter who was suing the group for slandering him, Wood suffered a fatal heart attack. He had added a condition to his will: no one, including his children, could collect their inheritance until they filed legal affidavits affirming that they had never been Communists. Wood&#x27;s daughter, actress K.T. Stevens, made these observations about her father&#x27;s demise:

==Death==
Wood died from a heart attack in Hollywood at the age of 66. His grave is located in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Wood received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6714 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960.

Biographer Tony Thomas provides this eulogy:

<text>Dedemsvaart (&quot;Dedem&#x27;s Canal&quot;) (Dutch Low Saxon: &quot;De Voart&quot;) is a town in Overijssel, the Netherlands.

== Overview ==
The town is located along an old canal, also called , which is the source of the village&#x27;s name. The canal lost its commercial importance after World War II. The area around Dedemsvaart, until 2001 part of the municipality of Avereest, was an important centre for industry. Willem Jan van Dedem, after whom the canal and town were named, made a plan to dig a canal; construction began on 9 July 1810. Around two years later, in 1811, the canal had already reached Balkbrug, and the town was established.

In 1845 the project got into financial trouble and the baron had to forfeit the canal of Dedemsvaart, until then a private possession, to the province of Overijssel, who took further care of the canal. Over the years the canal changed and eventually became unfit for commercial use.

The village of Dedemsvaart lies near the N377 between Balkbrug and Lutten. The municipality of Avereest was disbanded in 2001 and became part of the municipality of Hardenberg. It&#x27;s also the only settlement within the municipality where cannabis is semi-legally sold.

==Notable attractions==
*&quot;Tuinen Mien Ruys&quot;, a complex of 25 gardens by noted Dutch landscape and garden architect Mien Ruys.
*&quot;Kalkovens&quot;, three big lime kilns, these were built in 1820.

* Daniel Koerhuis (born 1981), politician

<doc id="1060732" wikidata="Q2825360" url="?curid=1060732" title="Advanced Aviation Explorer">
<text>The Advanced Aviation Explorer is a two-seat ultralight marketed in kit form, for amateur construction. It is a high-wing taildragger aircraft of pusher configuration with tandem seating.

==Design and development==
The aircraft is a development of the Talon XP which in turn traces its lineage to the Maxair Drifter. The Explorer has been produced by a number of companies and under a variety of names.

The main advance over the Drifter is the Explorer&#x27;s use of main wing struts and jury struts in place of cable bracing. Like all aircraft in this family they feature excellent visibility, especially from the front seat when the optional fibreglass cockpit pod is removed. As a result, the design is often employed as a camera platform. It can be flown on floats and has been used for banner towing.

Construction is of bolted aluminium tube, with the flying surfaces covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. The kit takes about 150–250 hours to assemble.

The standard engine is the Rotax 582 of , with the four-stroke Rotax 912 optional.

==Variants==
;Explorer
:Initial version, derived from the Talon XP, but with struts in place of the cable-braced wing. Produced by Advanced Aviation, no longer in production.
;Zephyr
:Similar to the Explorer, but produced by Arnet Pereyra Inc, no longer in production. Also known as the &quot;Zephyr II&quot;, 40 reported flying in 1998/2001.
;Toucan
:New name for the aircraft when manufacturer Arnet Pereyra changed the company name to Aero Adventure Aviation, powered by a Rotax 582 of . In production, with 10 flying at the end of 2011.
;Barracuda
:Aero Adventure Aviation produced version powered by the Rotax 912, gross weight, optimized for amphibious floats. Out of production, with 1 flying at the end of 2007.

<doc id="1060737" wikidata="Q2544104" url="?curid=1060737" title="Vroomshoop">
<text>Vroomshoop is a town located at the center of the municipality Twenterand in the Dutch province of Overijssel and was founded around 1859. The earliest inhabitants lived from the peat that was found in the nearby area.

Farmers from the Groningen area played an important role by the excavated peat into farmland here. They settled mainly on the Tonnendijk Road. The Groninger-farms are still on the Tonnendijk.

== History ==
In 1859, the canal Almelo-De Haandrik was dug, and a peat colony developed along the canal. Around 1875, the economy became based on potatoes and colonists from Groningen and Drenthe settled in the area. The Saint Willibrord Church was finished in 1868. In 1906, the village still contained 109 sod houses. In 2009, the village of Geerdijk separated from Vroomshoop.

== Transportation ==
In 1906 a train station was built in Vroomshoop, because of the NOLS track from Mariënberg to Almelo.
The Original name for this station was &quot;Den Ham - Vroomshoop&quot;, it was changed to &quot;Vroomshoop&quot; in 1952 because of the distance in between Den Ham and Vroomshoop.

Since 2014 Arriva operates this service.

At one time, there was a vlotbrug at Vroomshoop.

== Triathlon ==
Triatlon Vroomshoop started as a one-off event in 2009 has now become an annual event which hosts approximately 700 athletes every year.
Starting 2016 it has also been the host of the Schuiteman 2deDivisie Noord, a part of the national second division championship.

== Dragon boat Festival ==
For the 6th time in 2014 organised by &quot;de Smoezen&quot;, Vroomshoops carnival association.
A Chinese tradition at the canal, a spectacular boat race by different regional teams.

== Notable people ==

<text>Vriezenveen (Lower Saxon: &quot;&#x27;t Vjenne, Venne, Vjenne, Vreeznven or Vreeinvenne&quot;) is a town in the municipality of Twenterand in the Dutch province of Overijssel. The population was 13,800 on January 1, 2020.

Until July 1, 2002, Vriezenveen formed an independent municipality together with the villages of De Pollen, Westerhaar-Vriezenveensewijk, Aadorp and the hamlets Bruinehaar, Weitemanslanden and Westerhoeven. In 2001, the municipality of Vriezenveen was merged with the municipality of Den Ham, which included the villages of Den Ham, Vroomshoop, and Geerdijk. The new municipality was called Vriezenveen and renamed Twenterand in 2003.

The town hall of Twenterand is located in Vriezenveen. The dependence of the town hall in Den Ham was closed on May 30, 2008.

==History==
The oldest mention of Vriezenveen dates from 1364, when Evert van Hekeren, lord of Almelo, wrote a charter for the free Frisians, their heirs and all the people who lived on the moor, from the &quot;Wierdense Weuste&quot; to the &quot;Bawesbeek&quot;. The people who lived on the moor were obliged to pay one bucket of butter a year, measured according to the standard of Zwolle, on St. Martin&#x27;s Day at Huis Almelo. This concerned a lease of butter and was paid in kind; the lease could not be bought off. The lord of Almelo had allowed the free Frisians to colonize the moor above his land. &quot;Almelervene&quot;, as Vriezenveen was called before the 15th century, was created from forty farms, roughly stretching from the current Schipsloot to the later excavated canal of Overijssel. Each farm had a width of sixteen fields (16 × 7 is 112 metres). To the east of the settlement, up to the Bawesbeek, an area remained, the so-called &quot;Oosterhoeven&quot;. This area was not divided and it is rumored that it was possibly the joint property of the residents. To the west of the settlement, there too was a similar area of undivided ground from the Boerstege to the Stouwe. These were the &quot;Westerhoeven&quot; and &quot;Woesten&quot;. It is rumored that these lands were also joint property. The Almelervene settlement grew; By the mid-15th century, the village had already changed so much that the various farms were no longer sixteen fields wide, but were reduced to ten, or even eight fields wide.

The German bishop from Münster, Bernhard von Galen, aptly nicknamed &quot;Bommen Berend&quot; (English: &quot;Bombing Bernard)&quot;, plundered and robbed Twente around the year 1665. Vriezenveen was spared until 1665, because it was surrounded by swamp and bog. There was only one road to Vriezenveen and it was guarded by troops of the Dutch States Army. However, there was a harsh winter in the year 1666, which froze the moors and the surrounding swamp. The road to Vriezenveen lay open and in January 1666, 1500 riders of the bishop&#x27;s army rode into Vriezenveen. The village was looted and the houses and the church were set on fire. A large number of people were killed and the rest were taken as prisoners.

The new Vriezenveen was not rebuilt on the Buterweg, along which it had previously lain. It was instead rebuilt on a sandy road to the north, the present village street. This rebuilding took place at a rapid pace and at the beginning of the 18th century the old Vriezenveen on the Buterweg was a thing of the past. Only the old cemetery of this old Vriezenveen has been preserved. The village is now characterised by a 6.2-kilometer long built-up village street (from west to east: Hammerweg, Westeinde and Oosteinde) with characteristic facades on the houses. The special Engbertsdijksvenen, a partly still living biodiverse raised bog complex with its rare flora and fauna, is a reminder of what the area looked like, before the intensive colonisation of the area by the lord of Almelo and his subjects was set in motion.

Quite a lot is known about the last magistrate (Dutch: Schout) and first Mayor of Vriezenveen, Jan Kruys, because his detailed diaries from the period 1817-1830 have been preserved.

=== Religion ===
During the Reformation, which also permeated Twente, most of the Vriezenveners &quot;switched&quot; to Protestantism. In the 19th century the conservative orthodox Calvinist Protestants became the majority. A Vriezenvener, Jan Machiel Krijger, (1874–1951) took part as a party leader in the 1946 Dutch parliamentary elections on behalf of the Protestant Union. The former CHU member obtained 32,020 votes. To this day most Vriezenveners are either Dutch Reformed or Reformed; to be seen in the support of the SGP and the predecessors of the ChristenUnie; the RPF and the GPV. However, a strong Catholic minority remained on the eastern side of the village. This Roman Catholic community was able to inaugurate its own parish church in the early 20th century. The church and parish are dedicated to the Roman Catholic saint Anthony the Great.

Until the Second World War, there was a Jewish community in Vriezenveen. In 1878, the Vriezenveen synagogue, &quot;Mikdash Me&#x27;at&quot; (small shrine), was built, after the King&#x27;s commissioner P.C. Nahuijs, by Royal Decree of December 2, 1876, granted a government subsidy of 850 guilders to the local Israelite Congregation for its construction. The synagogue was completed in 1879. The community then numbered 27 people. In 1906, the Jewish community became part of Almelo, and in 1923, the building was sold. The building is still intact and has been listed as a municipal monument since 1996. The former synagogue has been a warehouse of a private company since 1973, but the building is scheduled to be demolished.

=== Trade ===
The inhabitants of Vriezenveen (Rusluie) had a lively trade with the Russian city of Saint Petersburg in the period from 1720 to 1917. Over the course of time, various companies from Vriezenveen founded trading houses and shops on notable streets and in notable buildings, such as on the Nevsky Prospekt and in the adjacent &quot;Gostiny Dvor&quot;. Hendrik Kruys was the owner of trading house &#x27;Java&#x27; at Grosse Morskaya 38 in Saint Petersburg. Although they managed to acquire a permanent place in the grand city at the mouth of the Neva, many Vriezenveners eventually returned to their hometown.

On May 16, 1905, there was a great fire in Vriezenveen that almost destroyed the entire town. After the fire, Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Henry – her prince-consort – formally known as Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin&quot;,&quot; personally came to support the residents of Vriezenveen. They made a personal donation of no less than a thousand guilders, intended for the reconstruction of Vriezenveen. The fire was commemorated in 2005, with a parade of historic fire-fighting vehicles.

The Jansen &amp; Tilanus company was spared during the great fire. The textile factory was the largest employer in the town at the time and the fire ended just before the factory on the Westeinde street. Due to the dryness of the commonly used thatched roofs and the strong winds from the east, there was no stopping the fire. 228 houses, mostly built in the aforementioned style, went up in flames. The richer farms and Rusluie houses made of brick and with greater garden distance from other houses, turned out to be more resistant to the fire and still stand to this day. The most famous of these still-standing farms, is the &quot;Peddemors&quot; farm. The Historical Museum deals with the history of the municipality of Vriezenveen, and of the town itself. There is, among other things, a historical department about the textile history of Vriezenveen and extensive documentation about the great fire of 1905. In addition, an old living room, a farmhouse kitchen and a school class from long ago are on display, which allows people to get a glimpse of life in the past.

During the Second World War, Vriezenveen became the temporary home of many children from Rotterdam. Contact was made through the Roman Catholic pastor of Vriezenveen, dhr. Van Rhijn – originally from Rotterdam – and the children were taken care of in Vriezenveen&#x27;s foster families. On May 1, 2004, the association &quot;Oud Vriezenveen&quot; organized a reunion where about a hundred so-called &quot;oorlogskinderen&quot; (English: &quot;war children&quot;) – mostly from Rotterdam – gathered. The war children, at the time referred to as &quot;bleekneusjes&quot; (English: &quot;pale noses&quot;), were asked to put their stories on paper, which resulted in the book &quot;Bleekneusjes oorlogskinderen&quot;. In April 2006, the first copy of this book was presented to deputy Gert Ranter by initiator José Bosch-Höfte, with great interest from many war children.

Up until the 1960s, the village did not have elder care, because of a &quot;strong general regional sense of commitment and duty towards helping each other&quot;, also known as &quot;noaberschap&quot; (English: &quot;neighbour-ship&quot;).On December 23, 1960, the Protestant-Christian Foundation De Vriezenhof was founded. The construction of the retirement home then took five years, on the site where a rectory stood before.

Vriezenveen has two football clubs, &quot;DOS &#x27;37&quot; (Door Oevening Sterk) and &quot;DETO&quot; (Door Eendracht Tot Overwinning). There is also the korfball/netball club &quot;Amicitia&quot;, basketball club &quot;Peatminers&quot;, volleyball club &quot;Vrivo&quot;, swimming and water polo club &quot;VZPC&quot;, athletics association &quot;AV Twenterand&quot;, shooting association &quot;SV Vriezenveen&quot;, tennis club &quot;TCV&quot;, ice skating club &quot;Centrale Schaatstraining Vriezenveen&quot; and skating club &quot;De Eendracht Vriezenveen&quot;, chess association &quot;Vrimot,&quot; gym association &quot;KEV&quot; (Kracht En Vriendschap), judo association &quot;Judokwai Vriezenveen&quot;, tug-of-war club &quot;TTV Vriezenveen&quot;, and the scouting association &quot;Admiraal Kruys&quot;.

Vriezenveen has two natural ice rinks. One of them is located on the Geesterenseweg and owned by &quot;IJsclub de Eendracht&quot;. The other ice rink is located at the sports park in Vriezenveen and is owned by &quot;IJsclub Vooruit&quot;.

The foundation &quot;Sportpromotie Twenterand&quot; organizes the &quot;Twenterandrun&quot; once a year and the &quot;Nacht van Twenterand&quot; once a year. The Twenterandrun is a semi-professional running race, described as the &quot;Van Dam tot Dam run&quot; – the biggest yearly running race of Amsterdam and the surrounding regions – of the east. In 2002 the running competition was organized for the first time and in 2007 the first lustrum was celebrated with a performance by singer Jannes.

Up to and including 2006, a cycling tour was held every year under the name &quot;Ronde van Vriezenveen&quot;. Due to limited interest and the very unfavorable location of the course, this Ronde van Vriezenveen has been changed into an ATB couple race through the centre of Vriezenveen and continued under the name &quot;Nacht van Twenterand&quot;. This race is also organized by the foundation Sportpromotie Twenterand

There is also a harmony orchestra that has won the national championship several times, the Vriezenveense Harmonie. For further relaxation there is the Herman Jansen-Park.

Once a year there is a fair. There is also a market every Wednesday morning. The last Wednesday of the summer holiday, a farmers market is organized which always attracts thousands of visitors. In recent years, local entrepreneurs (mainly catering establishments) have been trying to attract more and more people to Vriezenveen by organizing various activities. The best example of this is the yearly festival, Randrock, which attracts thousands of visitors and is a huge boon to local entrepreneurs.

== Traffic and transport ==
Vriezenveen is located on the National Road 36 (&quot;N36&quot;) from Hardenberg to Almelo and Wierden. The train station on the route Almelo – Mariënberg is located in the west of the village. It is served twice an hour by Arriva with trains of the LINT type in the &quot;Blauwnet/Vechtdallijnen&quot; style.

The main bus line is Line 83 from Almelo to the bus station &quot;&quot;Nieuwe Daarlerveenseweg&quot;,&quot; in Vriezenveen. This route is driven by Syntus, in &quot;Twents&quot;-style. In addition, Line 81 runs through Vriezenveen via the bus station in Westerhaar to Ommen and towards Almelo. Since April 1, 2007, residents can also use the regional taxi.

== Language ==
A unique dialectical variant of the Lower Saxon language group is spoken in Vriezenveen, albeit to a decreasing degree; aptly named &quot;Vriezenveens&quot; (Lower Saxon: &quot;Vjeans&quot;). In terms of pronunciation, this is less like the surrounding Twents, although grammatically and lexically it draws from the same source.

=== History ===
Some sources claim that Frisian influences can be heard in Vjeans. This seems plausible, because Vriezenveen was founded by Frisians. Other sources claim that the unique Vjeanse pronunciation is due to the Rusluie. These tradesmen from Vriezenveen settled in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but usually returned to Vriezenveen years later. In Saint Petersburg they formed a tight-knit community of several hundred people, who most likely spoke to each other in Vjeans. A strong Russian influence on the Vjeans of those who stayed behind therefore seems less plausible.

Because Twente was more or less cut off from the rest of the Netherlands by the moorland for centuries, links were created with Westphalia and the adjacent Münsterland. The large city of Münster was looked at for the latest fashion and customs. The language in Münster (Westphalian) was also seen as the standard and the whole of Twente (including Vriezenveen) went along with this. A characteristic feature of Westphalian is the &quot;Vowel breaking&quot;, which makes an open &quot;ee&quot;, &quot;oo&quot; and &quot;eu&quot; sound like a &quot;twisted&quot; , and . &quot;Weten&quot; became &quot;wiëten&quot;, &quot;Koken&quot; became &quot;koëken&quot; and &quot;Lui/Leu&quot; became &quot;luje&quot;. This rotation can also be heard clearly in the spoken Low Saxon variants of Rijssens and Enters. However, Vjeans seems to have gone even a step further in this, so that &quot;Wiëten&quot; now sounds like &quot;wjetn/wjet&#x27;n&quot; and &quot;Koëken&quot; like &quot;&quot;kwakn/kwak&#x27;n&quot;. (English: &quot;Weten – Knowing / Koken – Cooking / Lui|Leu – Folk&quot;)

=== Preservation ===
In 2014, four stories from the children&#x27;s book series Jip en Janneke were translated into Vjeans and included in &quot;Jipke en Jannöaken&quot;&quot;, the translation of this children&#x27;s book series into Twents. Other than that though, other attempts to preserve the &quot;real&quot; Vjeans seem to be limited to the attempts of local linguists or local historical societies.

In 1969, the &quot;Woordenboek van het Vriezenveens, deel 1&quot; (English: &quot;Dictionary of Vriezenveens, part 1&quot;), was written by Dr. Hendrik Entjes. Additional parts have since not appeared further.

<text>Warffum (Gronings: Waarvum)is a village in the Dutch province of Groningen. It is located in the municipality of Het Hogeland. It had a population of around 2,175 in January 2017.

==History==

The history of Warffum can be traced back to at least 600 AD, and it has been estimated that the village was founded as far back as the eighth century.

In 1893 a train station was opened in Warffum, connecting Warffum to Groningen and Roodeschool. It was a separate municipality until 1990, when it became a part of Hefshuizen, which has been known as Eemsmond since 1 January 1992.

In 2004 the Dutch royal family visited Warffum as part of the Koninginnedag (Queensday) celebrations.

==Culture==
The museum Het Hoogeland shows life in Warffum about a hundred-year ago through a collection that includes about fifteen houses. 
The famous Dutch singer-songwriter Ede Staal was born in Warffum.

Perhaps the biggest annual happening in Warffum is the op Roakeldais festival. This is a folkdance festival that attracts professional dance groups from all over the world.

<text>Lorenzo Christopher Wright (December 9, 1926 – March 27, 1972) was an American athlete. A Detroit native, he started at Miller High School and Wayne State University; Wright is renowned for his noteworthy track and field accomplishments.

== World-Class Athlete ==
Lorenzo C. Wright&#x27;s crowning athletic achievement would come as a member of the gold medal winning 4×100 meter relay team at the 1948 Olympic Games. During those same London Games, Wright finished fourth in a fiercely contested long jump competition. Willie Steele of the U.S. won the gold medal at 25 feet 8 inches (7.825 m); Australia&#x27;s Theo Bruce came in second, taking the silver medal at 24 feet  inches (7.555 m). Herb Douglas of the United States captured the bronze medal with a jump of 24 feet 9 inches (7.545 m), and Lorenzo Wright ended up in fourth place at 24 feet  inches (7.45 m)a hand&#x27;s width from a second trip to the medals podium.

At Miller High, Wright was a two-time Detroit Public Secondary Schools Athletic League champion in the long jump. Upon graduating from high school, LC Wright served eighteen months in the U.S. Army. Then, as a student-athlete for Wayne State University, Wright was an NCAA All-American in 1947 and 1948; placing second and third respectively in the long jump. Lorenzo Wright was a Central Collegiate Conference indoor champion in the 60-yard dash; he was also the inaugural Mid-American Conference titlist in the 100 and 220-yard dash, 220-yard low hurdles, and the long jump. During his career, Wright won two individual and two relay squad titles at the prestigious Penn Relays. Wright also won the long jump event at the 1948 and 1952 National AAU Championships.

Wright&#x27;s indoor and outdoor long jump marks, along with his performances in the 100-meter and 220-yard dash, are still Wayne State University varsity recordshaving stood the test of time for nearly seventy years.

== Dedicated Coach and Administrator ==
Following his athletic career, L.C. Wright served many seasons as the track and swimming coach at Miller, Eastern and Southwestern High School; during the 1960s, Wright&#x27;s athletes were some of the best in the United States. Wright was later appointed Director of the Detroit Public Secondary Schools Athletic League (DPSSAL). Wright was honored posthumously as a 1973 inductee to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and -in 1976- as a charter member of the Wayne State University Athletic Hall of Fame.

One of Detroit&#x27;s major interscholastic athletic facilities, adjacent to Martin Luther King High School, is named Lorenzo C. Wright Field.

==Death==
In 1972, at age 45, Wright was stabbed to death in his Detroit home by his wife Elizabeth during a dispute about their possible separation.

<text>Farnley Hall is a stately home in Farnley, North Yorkshire, England. It is located near Otley. The original early seventeenth-century house was added to in the 1780s by John Carr, who also designed Harewood House. The hall is now a Grade I listed building.

The house consists of an 18th-century square block with earlier and later L-shaped wings at the rear and is built of coursed squared gritstone and ashlar with stone slate and lead roofs.

==History==
Farnley hall was occupied in the 1780s by Francis Fawkes. After his death in 1786, Farnley Hall was inherited by distant relative Walter Hawkesworth of Hawksworth Hall, who adopted the surname Fawkes by royal licence and commissioned John Carr to build the new range alongside the old. When Walter Fawkes died in 1792 the hall passed to his son, also Walter Hawkesworth, who also adopted the surname Fawkes, and was known as Walter Ramsden Fawkes. He was MP for Yorkshire in 1806 and was High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1823. During his tenure a regular visitor was the Victorian artist and philosopher John Ruskin, who was taken with the enormous collection of paintings by J. M. W. Turner, a close friend of the Ramsden Fawkes. Between 1808 and 1824 Farnley was a second home to Turner. Ramsden Fawkes owned over 250 Turner watercolours and six large oil paintings. A selection of Turner&#x27;s works from the Farnley Hall collection were sold in 1890 for £25,000.

Frederick Hawksworth Fawkes of Farnley Hall was High Sheriff for 1932. During the Second World War the hall served as a maternity hospital.

Nicholas Horton-Fawkes owned and carefully restored the house until his death in 2011. Horton-Fawkes served as President of the Turner Society. Guy Fawkes was related to the Fawkes of Farnley.

<doc id="1060764" wikidata="Q14548294" url="?curid=1060764" title="Music of Niue">
<text>The music of [[Niue]] has a long history. Niue is a Polynesian island in the South Pacific. Though independent, it is in free association with New Zealand.

==History==
The Niue culture and tradition is also rich in music. However, most of the very traditional Niuean songs are sung without the use of any musical instruments. The only instrument that is used for the very traditional dances is a wooden drum known in Niuean as or , made out of a carved trunk of the tree. The use of the instrument is mainly to provide a beat for the dances.

===&quot;Tā Mē&quot;===
The is a traditional group performance, celebrating significant occasions such as, the opening of a new building or facility, weddings, birthdays, launches, milestones and fundraising events. It involves both men and women singing and dancing to Niuean songs. This is often accompanied by musical instruments like the guitar, ukulele and sometimes a traditionally-crafted bass drum.

Typically, there are multiple items during a &quot;Tā Mē&quot; and the dance actions are generally choreographed to match the words of the songs. The songs performed often follow familiar Niuean and Pacific melodies, and some lyrics are customised to fit the occasion.

Women usually perform seated, facing the audience, while the men perform while standing behind them. These positions are not a reflection of social status, as men and women hold equal standing in Niuean culture.

===Today===
As Niue modernized, its music began to be influenced by other cultures. Manaia Studio and the Niue Broadcasting Corporation are the only recording studios on the island. There are many Niue artists who have made it to the top. 

Pauly Fuemana of OMC (Otara&#x27;s Millionaires Club) is half Niuean and half Māori, and became the first New Zealander to reach top of the charts in 12 countries with his hit &quot;How Bizarre&quot;. The record sold over 3 million albums which made him the most successful Pacific music artist ever. The Fuemana Family is the most successful Pacific family with over 12 NZ music awards between. 

Musician Che Fu is very popular, and has won several Tui Awards, a New Zealand music award. This is an enormous achievement for a country with only a few thousand people, as other countries bigger than Niue have yet to reach those heights conquered by these Niuean artists. His father, Tigilau Ness, is also a highly regarded artist who received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Pacific Music Awards. 

The Kilakokonut Krew group and record label is also made up of Niuean artists Vela Manusaute and Glen Jackson. The migration of Niueans to New Zealand also make greater influences on Niuean music. There are up-and-coming artists, such as MC Kava, who now sing in contemporary styles of music like rap, hip-hop and reggae. 

There are also many Niuean artists who have produced records in Niuean language. Fuata Muta was the first Niuean group to play and record their own music albums. From the actual playing of the instruments to the engineering and mixing the songs at one of Sydney&#x27;s largest recording studios in 1985 and 1986. Church choirs are also common. However, they sing traditional hymns with no instrumental accompaniment at all.

Niueans are talented people who have charted and Include Harry Uasi Leki who was originally from the village of Hakupu, who was in a band in the 1960s called &quot;Simple Image&quot; , which had four chart topping hits including &quot;Spinning Spinning Spinning&quot;. Feau Halatau from the village of Hakupu, was a founding member and drummer of The Radars. He was known to be partially blind and his group won a TVNZ Music award in the 1980s. Tyree Tautogia was part of the NZ hip hop group called Smashproof, he is also a person of Niuean ancestry and descent. Tony Fuemana aka OMC, a Niuean descendant from the village of Mutalau topped the charts in 12 countries and won a few awards in New Zealand. Che Fu Ness topped the charts also and has won a few awards in New Zealand. Tony T aka Tony Nogotautama from the village of Hakupu, was part of the famous band Ardijah and D - Faction, which released the popular cover &quot;Down in the Boondocks&quot; . 

Three Niuean LPs have been released on vinyl which were pressed when Niueans travelled for the South Pacific Arts Festivals in Suva &amp; Rotorua. Many Niuean cassette tapes and CDs have been produced and made over the years in Australia, New Zealand and Niue. 

Victa Talima released a cassette tape in Sydney, Australia. It was titled &quot;Neva&quot; and released in 1997. It included his cult classic remake of Titania Talagi&#x27;s hit &quot;Koe Fisi Siale&quot; and is popular among Niueans in the world. He released two CDs, one called &quot;Hihina Mata&quot; (2000) and &quot;Vela&quot; (2006) to moderate success with some popular tunes. His song &quot;Tolitoli&quot; from the Hihina Mata album was one of the first Niuean songs to be banned from the Niuean radio station BCN, for its explicit lyrics. 

Niue had a recording studio called Manaia Studios, which produced a few artists famous to Niueans. This included: Malakava Sisters (daughters of Titania and Matalose Talagi), they sang the cult classic &quot;Tama Afine Niue&quot; and covered popular hits &quot;Koe Auro Moe Alio&quot;; Teuila and Frances (sung &quot;Fakatai a Susana&quot;); Sionepaea Kumitau (sung &quot;Haku Loto Paiki&quot; and &quot;Fano Au He Tau&quot;); Bommo &amp; Co (Kimray Vaha); Falala Niue (a compilation of songs for the 1999 Miss Niue pageant, including popular hits &quot;Alito Mata He Fuata&quot;. This was sung by Coral Pasisi &amp; Jackson Hekesi. Composed for Miss Fiafia Rex, written by Tagaloa Rex Cooper.); &quot;Falala Mai Fineone&quot; sung by the Hakupu Youth; and Tomanogi (husband and wife duo Tom and Ligimanogi Misikea, composer of the popular Huvalu Forest Conservation party song &quot;Ta Kalali&quot;).

Ta Kalali has been covered a few times. Jolly Talima &amp; The Talima Band covered this song for the &quot;Çyclone Heta&quot; album. Jackson Hekesi (J&#x27;Love) covered this song for his &#x27;Blast from the Past&#x27; album.

Napoleon Manetoa &amp; The Lost Liku Lovers, released the CD titled &#x27;Neva&#x27;. The album contained many known hits and a few new songs never heard before. It included the tracks&quot; Pa pa Seliga, Ko E Kufani, Kua Amanaki&quot; and many more.

Other Niuean groups or artists to release music are Kuma Mo Feke, Mefi Fifita, Malcolm Lakatani, Sheelagh Cooper, James Viliua, Tina Tuibenau, Brad Etuata, Annette Posimani, Jayjay Poumale. 

Hools released music under the artist name &quot;Tommy Nee&quot;, before changing his name. Hools launched his own music platform, Banana Boat Records (BBR) in 2024.

<text>WEHI (), previously known as the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, and as the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, is Australia&#x27;s oldest medical research institute. Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who won the Nobel Prize in 1960 for his work in immunology, was director from 1944 to 1965. Burnet developed the ideas of clonal selection and acquired immune tolerance. Later, Professor Donald Metcalf discovered and characterised colony-stimulating factors. , the institute hosted more than 750 researchers who work to understand, prevent and treat diseases including blood, breast and ovarian cancers; inflammatory diseases (autoimmunity) such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease; and infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV and hepatitis B and C.

Located in Parkville, Melbourne, it is closely associated with The University of Melbourne and The Royal Melbourne Hospital. The institute also has a campus at La Trobe University. The director of WEHI, since April 2024, is Professor Ken Smith.

==History==


The institute was founded in 1915 using funds from a trust established by Eliza Hall following the death of her husband Walter Russell Hall. The institute owes its origin to the inspiration of Harry Brookes Allen, who encouraged the use of a small portion of the charitable trust to found a medical research institute. The vision was for an institute that &#x27;will be the birthplace of discoveries rendering signal service to mankind in the prevention and removal of disease and the mitigation of suffering.’

In April 1915 the new Melbourne Hospital agreed to provide a home for the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Research in Pathology and Medicine, as it was then known. A few weeks later, the new institute&#x27;s director-designate, Gordon Mathison, suffered fatal wounds in the ANZAC Battle of Gallipoli. The floors set aside for the institute in the grounds of the old Melbourne Hospital were given over to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in 1918 until a new director could be secured at the cessation of hostilities.

Sydney Patterson was appointed the first director and took up his post in 1919. Patterson resigned and returned to England in 1923. He was followed by Charles Kellaway for the critical years 1923-44. Kellaway formalised research streams, supported aspiring local researchers, built up public benefactions and secured the first Commonwealth grants for the institute&#x27;s researches. He also oversaw the plans and construction of the first separate institute building adjacent to the new Royal Melbourne Hospital, which opened in 1942. Under Kellaway&#x27;s directorship, the institute came to achieve international recognition as a centre for excellence in medical research by the outbreak of World War II.

Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the institute director between 1944 and 1965, and he brought the institute to international prominence for virological research, especially influenza, and then for immunology. Such was the nature of Burnet’s achievement that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1960 with Sir Peter Medawar for the discovery of immunological tolerance.

Sir Gustav Nossal succeeded Burnet as director in 1965, aged 35. Under his stewardship, the institute grew in size and scope, with its scientists making important discoveries in the control of immune system responses, cell cycle regulation and malaria. During this time, the group led by Professor Donald Metcalf discovered and characterised the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), which have benefited more than 10 million cancer patients worldwide.

Between 1996 and 2009, it was led by Professor Suzanne Cory, and between 2009 and 2023 was led by Professor Doug Hilton . In November 2023 Professor Ken Smith was announced as the institute&#x27;s seventh director, commencing April 2024. 

In the lead up to its centenary in 2015, the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute underwent significant building redevelopment. A new west wing was built in 2012, nearly doubling the institute&#x27;s size, funded by the Victorian and Australian Governments and The Atlantic Philanthropies.

In 2020, the institute rebranded itself to the simpler name WEHI, and updated its motto to &quot;Brighter together&quot;.

==Research==

The institute focuses solely on medical research, centred around:
* Cancers (such as leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast cancer and ovarian cancer)
* Inflammatory or autoimmune diseases (such as type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis)
* Infectious diseases (such as malaria, HIV and hepatitis B and C)

The institute is organised into the following 14 divisions (with current Division Heads in parentheses):

* ACRF Chemical biology (A/Professor Isabelle Lucet)
* ACRF Cancer and stem cells (Professors Geoff Lindeman and Jane Visvader)
* Bioinformatics (Professors Gordon Smyth and Melissa Davis) 
* Blood Cells and Blood Cancer (Professor Andreas Strasser)
* Clinical Translation (Professor Clare Scott and Professor Ian Wicks)
* Epigenetics and Development (Professor Marnie Blewitt and Professor Anne Voss)
* Immunology (Associate Professor Daniel Gray and Professor Phil Hodgkin)
* Infectious Diseases and Immune Defence (A/Professor Wai-Hong Tham and Professor Marc Pellegrini)
* Inflammation (Associate Professor James Murphy) 
* Personalised Oncology (Professor Peter Gibbs and Associate Professor Marie-Liesse Labat)
* Population Health and Immunity (Professors Melanie Bahlo and Ivo Mueller)
* Structural Biology (Associate Professor Matthew Call and Associate Professor Peter Czabotar)
* Ubiquitin Signalling (Professor David Komander) 

The institute is one of five research centres to establish the ACRF Centre for Therapeutic Target Discovery - an Australian-first collaborative and comprehensive cancer research centre. The new consortium is funded by a $5 million grant awarded in 2006 by the Australian Cancer Research Foundation. The award is in honour of Australian businessman Sir Peter Abeles .

==Education==

The institute forms the department of Medical Biology at the University of Melbourne; graduate students enrolled at the University who undertake research at the institute can obtain a Bachelor of Science (Honours), Bachelor of Biomedicine (Honours) or Doctor of Philosophy degree; medical students can also study for Advanced Medical Science. Undergraduate students can also be part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). During the 2005–2006 financial year 17 students obtained a PhD at the WEHI, while 17 obtained a Bachelor of Science (Honours). As of June 2006, the Institute hosts 60 PhD students.

The institute is also part of the Gene Technology Access Centre led by Chief Executive Officer Jacinta Duncan, located next to the institute building at University High School, which provides education programs in molecular and cell biology for secondary students in Victoria.

==Awards==
* In 2019, David Vaux and Andreas Strasser were joint recipients of the Florey Medal for their work on revealing the links between cell death and cancer.
*In 2020, David Vaux won the Bettison &amp; James Award, presented by the Adelaide Film Festival.

<text>Alienware Corporation is an American computer hardware subsidiary brand of Dell. Their product range is dedicated to gaming computers and accessories and can be identified by their alien-themed designs. Alienware was founded in 1996 by Nelson Gonzalez and Alex Aguila. The development of the company is also associated with Frank Azor, Arthur Lewis, Joe Balerdi, and Michael S. Dell (CEO). The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters is located in The Hammocks, Miami, Florida.

==History==

=== Founding ===
Alienware was established in 1996 as Saikai of Miami, Inc. by Nelson Gonzalez and Alex Aguila, two childhood friends. It assembled desktops, notebooks, workstations, and PC gaming consoles. According to employees, the name &quot;Alienware&quot; was chosen because of the founders&#x27; fondness for the hit television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, which also inspired the science-fiction themed names of product lines such as Area-51, Hangar 18, and Aurora. In 1997, the corporation changed its name to Alienware.

===Acquisition by Dell===
Dell had considered buying Alienware as early as 2002, but did not go through with the purchase until March 2006. As a subsidiary of Dell, Alienware retains control of its design and marketing while benefiting from Dell&#x27;s purchasing power, economies of scale, and supply chain, which lowered its operating costs.

Initially, Dell maintained its competing XPS line of gaming PCs, often selling computers with similar specifications, which may have hurt Alienware&#x27;s market share within its market segment. Due to corporate restructuring in the spring of 2008, the XPS brand was scaled down, and the desktop line was eliminated, leaving only XPS notebooks, but XPS desktop models had returned by the end of the year.
Product development of gaming PCs was consolidated with Dell&#x27;s gaming division, with Alienware becoming Dell&#x27;s premier gaming brand. On June 2, 2009, The M17x was introduced as the first Alienware/Dell branded system. This launch also expanded Alienware&#x27;s global reach from six to 35 countries while supporting 17 different languages.

==Products (after acquisition by Dell)==

===Windows OS-based consoles===
Alienware announced that it would be releasing a series of video game consoles starting in 2014, aiming to compete with Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 4, Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U, and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox One. The first version in this series, the Alpha, ran Windows 8.1. The operating system and ability to play PC games is what separates the Alpha from the eighth generation of video game consoles. At E3 2016, Alienware announced the second rendition of the Alpha, the Alpha R2. The R2 adds 6th generation Intel processors, a choice of either AMD&#x27;s Radeon R9 M470X or Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce 960 graphics cards, and support for Alienware&#x27;s proprietary Graphics Amplifier. It also ships with Windows 10.

===Graphics Amplifier===
The Graphics Amplifier allows an Alienware laptop to run most full length (or smaller, non-hybrid) desktop GPUs. A proprietary PCIe 3.0 ×4 cable is used instead of the Thunderbolt 3 cable used on most other eGPUs.

===Laptops===

<text>Doris Hart (June 20, 1925 – May 29, 2015) was an American tennis player who was active in the 1940s and first half of the 1950s. She was ranked world No. 1 in 1951. She was the fourth player, and second woman, to win a Career Grand Slam in singles. She was the first of only three players (all women) to complete the career &quot;Boxed Set&quot; of Grand Slam titles, which is winning at least one title in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at all four Grand Slam events. Only she and Margaret Court achieved this during the amateur era of the sport.

Hart played collegiate tennis for the Miami Hurricanes at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

==Tennis career==
Hart reached 67 Grand Slam finals and won 35 titles, tying with Louise Brough for sixth on the all-time list (behind Margaret Smith Court (64), Martina Navratilova (59), Billie Jean King (39), Serena Williams (39), and Margaret Osborne duPont (37)). Six of her titles were in women&#x27;s singles, 14 in women&#x27;s doubles, and 15 in mixed doubles. Hart is one of only three players, all women, to have a &quot;boxed set&quot; of Grand Slam titles — every possible title (singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles) from all four Grand Slam tournaments. The others are Margaret Smith Court and Martina Navratilova. Hart was the first person to accomplish this feat.

As a child, Hart suffered from osteomyelitis, which resulted in a permanently impaired right leg. She started playing tennis when she was 10 years old, greatly encouraged by her brother Bud.

After losing seven Grand Slam finals from 1942 through 1946, Hart won her first Grand Slam title at the 1947 Wimbledon Championships in women&#x27;s doubles. At that point, she was still a student at the University of Miami.

Her first Grand Slam singles title came at the 1949 Australian National Championships, where she was the only non-Australian player in the draw. She also won singles titles at the 1950 and 1952 French International Championships, the 1951 Wimbledon Championships (routing doubles partner Shirley Fry in the final), and the 1954 and 1955 U.S. National Championships. The 1955 U.S. singles final was the last Grand Slam singles match of her career.

Hart won the singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles titles at the 1951 Wimbledon Championships, playing the finals of all three events on the same day (July 7, 1951). She also won the &quot;triple crown&quot; at the 1952 French International Championships and the 1954 U.S. National Championships.

During her Wightman Cup career from 1946 through 1955, Hart was a perfect 14–0 in singles matches and 8–1 in doubles matches.

Hart did not lose a Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles match from the 1951 French International Championships through the semifinals of the 1954 Wimbledon Championships, 43 matches in total, although she skipped 4 Grand Slam tournaments during this period. She also did not lose a mixed doubles match at the 13 Grand Slam tournaments she played from the 1951 French International Championships through the 1955 U.S. National Championships. She (and partner Stan Smith) lost in the third round of the 1968 Wimbledon Championships to Frew McMillan and Annette Van Zyl Du Plooy 6–3, 12–10.

According to John Olliff and Lance Tingay of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Hart was ranked in the world top 10 from 1946 through 1955 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of world No. 1 in those rankings in 1951. Hart was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the United States Lawn Tennis Association from 1942 through 1955. She was the top ranked U.S. player in 1954 and 1955.

Hart retired from the tour in late 1955 to become a tennis teaching professional. Her autobiography &quot;Tennis with Hart&quot; was published that year.

She was inducted into the inaugural Class of 1967 inductees to the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame and inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1969.

She died on May 29, 2015, at her home in Coral Gables, Florida, at age 89.

<text>Isfield is a small village and civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex in England, located north-east of Lewes.

==History==

The village of Isfield originally grew adjacent to the ford where the London to Lewes Way Roman road crossed the river River Ouse. The village had an active history through the Saxon, Norman eras, when a Norman castle motte was built on the river bank near the church to guard the crossing. Local legend, as recalled by William Wratten, had it that King Harold spent the night before the Battle of Hastings in the village, at his demesne located where Isfield Place now stands.

Isfield became the home of John Shurley (died 1527), who was Cofferer of the Household to King Henry VIII. Isfield Place is a 17th-century manor house, incorporating part of the original 16th-century mansion of the Shurley family. Its design was influenced by Laughton Place nearby, following the marriage of Thomas Shurley, John&#x27;s grandson, with Anne Pelham, daughter of Sir Nicholas Pelham of Laughton.

The herbalist Nicholas Culpeper spent his childhood in the village at the home of his grandfather, Rev. William Attersole, who was vicar at St Margaret&#x27;s.

The area was heavily involved in the Wealden iron industry from the 15th century onwards.
Isfield again became a busy place in the 19th century. Much of its traffic was river-borne: coal and building materials, together with other products, used the Ouse as its transport. A paper-mill and a large flour-mill both made use of the river.

==Governance==
Isfield Parish Council is the lowest level of government, above which are Wealden District Council and East Sussex County Council. It is in the Wealden parliamentary constituency in the House of Commons.

==Geography==
The parish of Isfield stands on the flood-plain of the River Ouse, at its confluence with the River Uck and a convenient crossing point, a ford, which the Romans used; the road through the village crosses the Uck by bridge, and the erstwhile Wealden Line did likewise. The main A26 road, while crossing the parish, runs to the East of the village. The land hereabouts is a floodplain of the rivers and streams. The area can grow fine crops as a result of its rich soils with superficial deposits of Alluvium, River Terrace Deposits and Chalk Head, over Lower Chalk, Gault and Lower Greensand.

The ancient ecclesiastical parish, which is very similar to the modern civil parish, was 1,822 acres (736 ha) in size. Today&#x27;s population is relatively small. The village centre lies adjacent to the river crossing; a more modern part is further south.

The two miles of Ouse brooks from Oaktree Wood, () opposite Isfield church, north to Sharpsbridge, () are important brook meadows botanically. The University of Sussex had a project to restore some of the brook meadows east of Vuggles and Bunce&#x27;s Farms.

Like many places in Sussex, increased pressure for farm productivity has come at the expense of much of its natural beauty. North of Isfield was a densely wooded area, but much of the ancient woodland has been cut down, including large parts of Park Wood, Owlsbury Wood, Grove Wood, Stroodland Woods, and Foxearth Wood (a bit further west). Equally this area of the River Ouse and its tributaries have seen many losses. Just thirty years ago countless silvery Elvers (young Eels) rose up the Ouse weirs at Isfield, but they have long since gone due to pollution (nitrates, phosphates and trace chemicals) from farming and sewage with low flows from extraction and summer droughts.

===Isfield lock and weir===
The old Isfield Lock and weir () has recently been restored by Sussex Ouse Restoration Trust. It is much loved, &quot;The waters thunder down the weir to a sheltered pool, whilst above, the embayed river is still enough for water lilies&quot;. On the banks of the Isfield Weir to Rocky Wood there is archaic vegetation, such as dame&#x27;s violet and hemlock.

==Transport==
The village proper is located at the intersection of three roads. Two of these – Horsted Lane and Lewes Road – both connect directly to the A26 road, which runs along the eastern edge of the parish (through the hamlet of Rose Hill), and links the parish with Uckfield and Lewes. The third road – Station Road – runs north and eventually reaches the A272 road near Piltdown.

The parish is served by two bus routes, both part of Brighton &amp; Hove&#x27;s &quot;Regency Route&quot; brand. Route 29 runs along the A26, serving Rose Hill and linking it every 30 minutes with Lewes and Brighton to the southwest and Uckfield, Crowborough and Tunbridge Wells to the northeast. Route 29A, meanwhile, runs directly through the village and operates every hour in each direction, southwest to Lewes and Brighton and northeast to Uckfield and Heathfield. 

The village was once served by a railway – Isfield station, on the Wealden Line, was open from 1858 to 1969, and linked the village with , , , and (and on to London). Only the Brighton–Lewes and Uckfield–Eridge sections remain open today; there have been several campaigns to reopen the line between Lewes and Uckfield, although not all proposals have envisaged the reopening of Isfield station itself. A short section of the old railway, centred around the former Isfield station, has been preserved as the Lavender Line Steam Railway.

==Religion==
The parish church is dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch. Within the church are tombs of the Shurley/Shirley family.

==Leisure, culture and sport==
&quot;The Laughing Fish&quot; is a small public house with a garden.

<text>XMF (Extensible Music Format) is a tree-based digital container format used to bundle music-oriented content, such as a MIDI file and optionally the sounds it uses, liner notes or other content grouped by language-codes.

The first XMF definitions were to allow the bundling of a musical performance with the musical sounds used. For instance, a MIDI file could be stored together with a Downloadable Sounds file, and both files would travel together inside one XMF file. This specific use of an XMF file is referred to as XMF File Type 0 (streaming) or XMF File Type 1 (non-streaming), depending on whether the type of the MIDI file is 0 or 1, respectively.

There are currently five XMF File Types defined. The latest of which is XMF File Type 4 (counted from zero) and is called Interactive XMF (iXMF).

The specifications for the XMF were first published in 2001 by the MMA.

== Features ==
* Resources can be referenced internally (in the XMF file) or referenced externally using a URI.
* Resources can be country- and language-coded so that text could be shown in the right language depending on context.
* Resources can be compressed using ZLIB.
* Size information is stored using variable-length quantities, ensuring that the format can support an infinite number, while at the same time saving storage space.

<doc id="1060822" wikidata="Q1181130" url="?curid=1060822" title="Dean Smith (sprinter)">
<text>Finis Dean Smith (January 15, 1932 – June 24, 2023) was an American track and field athlete, winner of a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay at the 1952 Summer Olympics; he was also an actor and noted stuntman, appearing in many films and TV series.

== Early life, education, and sports career ==
Born in Breckenridge, Texas, Smith won the Amateur Athletic Union championships in 100 m in 1952. At the Helsinki Olympics, he was fourth in the 100 m and ran the leadoff leg for the American gold medal-winning 4 × 100 m relay team. As a sprinter on the Longhorn track team, Smith ran a 100-yard dash in 9.4 seconds, one-tenth of a second off the world record at the time.

After graduating from University of Texas at Austin where he ran track and was a member of the Silver Spurs, Smith played professional football for the Los Angeles Rams and the Pittsburgh Steelers ahead of his career in Hollywood.

=== Later sports career ===
Later on, Smith competed in amateur rodeo. His events were bareback bronc riding and calf roping. He won championships in both events. The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Associations made him an honorary member. He also participated in the team roping event in Reba McEntire&#x27;s Pro Celebrity Rodeo in May 1997.

== Post-sports/Hollywood career ==
Following his sports career, Smith performed as a professional rodeo cowboy and stuntman in various Western movies such as &quot;The Alamo&quot;, &quot;The Comancheros&quot;, &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;, &quot;McLintock!&quot;, &quot;Rio Conchos&quot;, &quot;Big Jake&quot;, &quot;El Dorado&quot;, and &quot;Rio Lobo&quot;. He also appeared in such Western TV shows as &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;Have Gun Will Travel&quot;, &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

Some of what &quot;Variety&quot; called his &quot;most impressive&quot; stunts included falling out of a two-story building into a hay wagon in &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963) starring Maureen O&#x27;Hara. Smith was noticed by famed director John Ford when working on the 1958 Rosalind Russell project, &quot;Auntie Mame,&quot; and as a result went on to be featured in many of Ford&#x27;s subsequent films.

== Honors ==
In 2006 he was inducted into the Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame. In 2009 he was inducted into the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum and Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Texas Track and Field Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Smith is a member of the Hollywood Stuntman&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1997 he was named &quot;All American Cowboy&quot;, and in 1998 he received a Golden Boot Award. In 2007 he received the Silver Spur award for his contributions as a stuntman in the film business.

== Personal life ==
Smith died on June 24, 2023, at age 91.

<text>In theoretical astrophysics, there can be a sphere of ionized hydrogen (H II) around a young star of the spectral classes O or B. The theory was derived by Bengt Strömgren in 1937 and later named Strömgren sphere after him. The Rosette Nebula is the most prominent example of this type of emission nebula from the H II-regions.

== The physics ==
Very hot stars of the spectral class O or B emit very energetic radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation, which is able to ionize the neutral hydrogen (H I) of the surrounding interstellar medium, so that hydrogen atoms lose their single electrons. This state of hydrogen is called H II. After a while, free electrons recombine with those hydrogen ions. Energy is re-emitted, not as a single photon, but rather as a series of photons of lesser energy. The photons lose energy as they travel outward from the star&#x27;s surface, and are not energetic enough to again contribute to ionization. Otherwise, the entire interstellar medium would be ionized. A Strömgren sphere is the theoretical construct which describes the ionized regions.

== The model ==
In its first and simplest form, derived by the Danish astrophysicist Bengt Strömgren in 1939, the model examines the effects of the electromagnetic radiation of a single star (or a tight cluster of similar stars) of a given surface temperature and luminosity on the surrounding interstellar medium of a given density. To simplify calculations, the interstellar medium is taken to be homogeneous and consisting entirely of hydrogen.

The formula derived by Strömgren describes the relationship between the luminosity and temperature of the exciting star on the one hand, and the density of the surrounding hydrogen gas on the other. Using it, the size of the idealized ionized region can be calculated as the &quot;Strömgren radius&quot;. Strömgren&#x27;s model also shows that there is a very sharp cut-off of the degree of ionization at the edge of the Strömgren sphere. This is caused by the fact that the transition region between gas that is highly ionized and neutral hydrogen is very narrow, compared to the overall size of the Strömgren sphere.

The above-mentioned relationships are as follows:
:* The hotter and more luminous the exciting star, the larger the Strömgren sphere.
:* The denser the surrounding hydrogen gas, the smaller the Strömgren sphere.

In Strömgren&#x27;s model, the sphere now named Strömgren&#x27;s sphere is made almost exclusively of free protons and electrons. A very small amount of hydrogen atoms appear at a density that increases nearly exponentially toward the surface. Outside the sphere, radiation of the atoms&#x27; frequencies cools the gas strongly, so that it appears as a thin region in which the radiation emitted by the star is strongly absorbed by the atoms which lose their energy by radiation in all directions. Thus a Strömgren system appears as a bright star surrounded by a less-emitting and difficult to observe globe.

Strömgren did not know Einstein&#x27;s theory of optical coherence. The density of excited hydrogen is low, but the paths may be long, so that the hypothesis of a super-radiance and other effects observed using lasers must be tested. A supposed super-radiant Strömgren&#x27;s shell emits space-coherent, time-incoherent beams in the direction for which the path in excited hydrogen is maximal, that is, tangential to the sphere.

In Strömgren&#x27;s explanations, the shell absorbs only the resonant lines of hydrogen, so that the available energy is low. Assuming that the star is a supernova, the radiance of the light it emits corresponds (by Planck&#x27;s law) to a temperature of several hundreds of kelvins, so that several frequencies may combine to produce the resonance frequencies of hydrogen atoms. Thus, almost all light emitted by the star is absorbed, and almost all energy radiated by the star amplifies the tangent, super-radiant rays.

The Necklace Nebula is a Strömgren sphere. It shows a dotted circle which gives its name. 

In supernova remnant 1987A, the Strömgren shell is strangulated into an hourglass whose limbs are like three pearl necklaces.

Both Strömgren&#x27;s original model and the one modified by McCullough do not take into account the effects of dust, clumpiness, detailed radiative transfer, or dynamical effects.

== The history ==
In 1938 the American astronomers Otto Struve and Chris T. Elvey published their observations of emission nebulae in the constellations Cygnus and Cepheus, most of which are not concentrated toward individual bright stars (in contrast to planetary nebulae). They suggested the UV radiation of the O- and B-stars to be the required energy source.

In 1939 Bengt Strömgren took up the problem of the ionization and excitation of the interstellar hydrogen. This is the paper identified with the concept of the Strömgren sphere. It draws, however, on his earlier similar efforts published in 1937.

In 2000 Peter R. McCullough published a modified model allowing for an evacuated, spherical cavity either centered on the star or with the star displaced with respect to the evacuated cavity. Such cavities might be created by stellar winds and supernovae. The resulting images more closely resemble many actual H II-regions than the original model.

== Mathematical basis ==
Let&#x27;s suppose the region is exactly spherical, fully ionized (x=1), and composed only of hydrogen, so that the numerical density of protons equals the density of electrons (formula_1). Then the Strömgren radius will be the region where the recombination rate equals the ionization rate. We will consider the recombination rate formula_2 of all energy levels, which is

:formula_3

formula_4 is the recombination rate of the n-th energy level. The reason we have excluded n=1 is that if an electron recombines directly to the ground level, the hydrogen atom will release another photon capable of ionizing up from the ground level. This is important, as the electric dipole mechanism always makes the ionization up from the ground level, so we exclude n=1 to add these ionizing field effects. Now, the recombination rate of a particular energy level formula_4 is (with formula_6):

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the recombination coefficient of the &quot;n&quot;th energy level in a unitary volume at a temperature formula_9, which is the temperature of the electrons in kelvins and is usually the same as the sphere. So after doing the sum, we arrive at

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the total recombination rate and has an approximate value of

:formula_12

Using formula_13 as the number of nucleons (in this case, protons), we can introduce the degree of ionization formula_14 so formula_15, and the numerical density of neutral hydrogen is formula_16. With a cross section formula_17 (which has units of area) and the number of ionizing photons per area per second formula_18, the ionization rate formula_19 is

:formula_20

For simplicity we will consider only the geometric effects on formula_18 as we get further from the ionizing source (a source of flux formula_22), so we have an inverse square law:

:formula_23

We are now in position to calculate the Stromgren radius formula_24 from the balance between the recombination and ionization

:formula_25
and finally, remembering that the region is considered as fully ionized (&quot;x&quot; = 1):

:formula_26

This is the radius of a region ionized by a type O-B star.

<text>The National Radio Club (NRC) is a non-profit hobbyist organization in the United States focused on the pursuit of DXing on the AM broadcast band. The group was founded in 1933 as a result of merging several regional radio clubs.

The NRC produces a magazine, &quot;DX News&quot;, which is issued 20 times annually. The club has also authored numerous books and radio station directories over the years. In 1985, to cater to the needs of visually impaired DX enthusiasts, the &quot;DX Audio Service&quot; was introduced. This was an audio cassette version of the newsletter, supplemented with additional content. However, this service ceased in 2014.

In 2005, the NRC set up an online platform, which enabled subscribers to download &quot;DX News&quot;. The site hosts several forums, with some open to all DX enthusiasts. However, forums with columns from &quot;DX News&quot; are exclusively accessible to NRC members.

The NRC organizes an annual convention, generally held in late summer. The location rotates between different American cities each year and the event is usually hosted by one or more of its members.

<doc id="1060840" wikidata="Q7307549" url="?curid=1060840" title="Reformed epistemology">
<text>In the philosophy of religion, Reformed epistemology is a school of philosophical thought concerning the nature of knowledge (epistemology) as it applies to religious beliefs. The central proposition of Reformed epistemology is that beliefs can be justified by more than evidence alone, contrary to the positions of evidentialism, which argues that while non-evidential belief may be beneficial, it violates some epistemic duty. Central to Reformed epistemology is the proposition that belief in God may be &quot;properly basic&quot; and not need to be inferred from other truths to be rationally warranted. William Lane Craig describes Reformed epistemology as &quot;One of the most significant developments in contemporary religious epistemology ... which directly assaults the evidentialist construal of rationality.&quot;

Reformed epistemology was so named because it represents a continuation of the 16th-century Reformed theology of John Calvin, who postulated a &quot;sensus divinitatis&quot;, an innate divine awareness of God&#x27;s presence. More recent influences on Reformed epistemology are found in philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff&#x27;s &quot;Reason within the Bounds of Religion,&quot; published in 1976, and Alvin Plantinga&#x27;s &quot;Reason and Belief in God&quot;, published in 1983.

Although Plantinga&#x27;s Reformed epistemology developed over three decades, it was not fully articulated until 1993 with the publication of two books in an eventual trilogy: &quot;,&quot; and &quot;Warrant and Proper Function&quot;. The third in the series was &quot;Warranted Christian Belief,&quot; published in 2000. Other prominent defenders of Reformed epistemology include William Lane Craig, William Alston, Michael C. Rea, and Michael Bergmann.

The argument from a proper basis is an ontological argument for the existence of God related to fideism. Alvin Plantinga argued that belief in God is a properly basic belief, and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.

==Concepts, definitions, and background==
Alvin Plantinga is the best-known defender of reformed epistemology. Reformed epistemology includes two arguments against classical foundationalism. The first grew out of his earlier argument in &quot;God and Other Minds&quot; (1967). In that work Plantinga argued that if our belief in other minds is rational without propositional or physical evidence, then belief in God is also rational. In his 1993 works, Plantinga argued that according to classical foundationalism most of us are irrational for having many beliefs we cannot justify, but which foundationalism does not accept as properly basic. Plantinga&#x27;s second argument against classical foundationalism is that it is self-referentially incoherent. It fails the test of its own rules, which require that it be either self-evident, incorrigible, or evident to the senses. William Lane Craig clarifies that properly basic beliefs can be &quot;memory beliefs&quot; (&quot;e.g&quot;., “I left the car keys in the dresser”) and &quot;perceptual beliefs&quot; (&quot;e.g&quot;., “I see a cat in the backyard”), but they can be defeasible, &quot;that is to say, they can be mistaken&quot;.

In Plantinga&#x27;s view, warrant is defined as the property of beliefs that makes them knowledge. Plantinga argues that a properly basic belief in God is warranted when produced by a sound mind, in an environment supportive of proper thought in accord with a design plan successfully aimed at truth. Because there is an epistemically possible model according to which theistic belief is properly basic and designed to form true belief in God, belief in God is probably warranted if theism is true. Plantinga does not argue that this model is true, but only that &quot;if&quot; it is true, theistic belief is also likely true, because then theistic belief would result from our belief-forming faculties functioning as they were designed.

This connection between the truth value of theism and its positive epistemic status suggests to some that the goal of showing theistic belief to be externally warranted requires reasons for supposing that theism is true (Sudduth, 2000). This point is answered by many theistic arguments which purport to provide sufficient propositional and physical evidence to warrant that belief, apart from reformed epistemology.

===Plantinga&#x27;s Reformed epistemology===
According to Reformed epistemology, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is properly basic, and due to a religious externalist epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called &quot;Proper functionalism&quot;, is a form of epistemological reliabilism.

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, &quot;Warrant: The Current Debate&quot;, Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of Roderick Chisholm, Laurence BonJour, William Alston, and Alvin Goldman. Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls &quot;warrant&quot;—what many others have called justification (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one&#x27;s epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.

In the second book, &quot;Warrant and Proper Function&quot;, he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability. Plantinga&#x27;s &quot;proper function&quot; account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one&#x27;s &quot;belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers&quot; are functioning properly—&quot;working the way it ought to work&quot;. Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a &quot;design plan&quot;, as well as an environment in which one&#x27;s cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: &quot;it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans&quot;, but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological naturalism – i.e. epistemology that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a creator God or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:

(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly...; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) ... the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs...; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as &quot;naturalistic&quot;, including the &quot;functional generalization&quot; view of John Pollock, the evolutionary/etiological account provided by Ruth Millikan, and a dispositional view held by John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter. Plantinga also discusses his evolutionary argument against naturalism in the later chapters of &quot;Warrant and Proper Function&quot;.

In 2000 Plantinga&#x27;s third volume, &quot;Warranted Christian Belief&quot;, was published. In this volume, Plantinga&#x27;s warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the &quot;A/C&quot; (Aquinas/Calvin) model, and the &quot;Extended A/C&quot; model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the Trinity, the Incarnation, the resurrection of Christ, the atonement, salvation, etc. can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

James Beilby has argued that the purpose of Plantinga&#x27;s &quot;Warrant&quot; trilogy, and specifically of his &quot;Warranted Christian Belief&quot;, is firstly to make a form of argument against religion impossible—namely, the argument that whether or not Christianity is true, it is irrational—so &quot;the skeptic would have to shoulder the formidable task of demonstrating the falsity of Christian belief&quot;
rather than simply dismiss it as irrational. In addition, Plantinga is attempting to provide a philosophical explanation of how Christians should think about their own Christian belief.

In 2016, Plantinga published &quot;Knowledge and Christian Belief&quot;, which is intended as a shortened version of &quot;Warranted Christian Belief&quot;. However, Plantinga does add brief sections on the latest developments in epistemology and how they relate to his work. He is especially critical of New Atheism owing to their reliance on &quot;de jure&quot; objections to the Christian faith.

==Criticisms==
Although Reformed epistemology has been defended by several theistic philosophers, it has both Christian and non-Christian critics.

===Great Pumpkin objection===

A common objection, known as &quot;The Great Pumpkin objection&quot;, which Alvin Plantinga in &quot;Warrant&quot; (1983) describes as follows:
It is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that the Great Pumpkin returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)

====Rebuttal====
Plantinga&#x27;s answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for &quot;proper basicality&quot; propounded by classical foundationalism (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just &#x27;any&#x27; belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn&#x27;t follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.

Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the Great Pumpkin objector &quot;knows&quot; that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as &#x27;basic&#x27; that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.

===Other objections===
Other common criticisms of Plantinga&#x27;s Reformed epistemology are that belief in God – like other sorts of widely debated and high-stakes beliefs – is &quot;evidence-essential&quot; rather than properly basic; that plausible naturalistic explanations can be given for humans&#x27; supposedly &quot;natural&quot; knowledge of God; and that it is arbitrary and arrogant for Christians to claim that their faith-beliefs are warranted and true (because vouched for by the Holy Spirit) while denying the validity of non-Christians&#x27; religious experiences.

<text>Richard Benjamin Haymes (September 13, 1918 – March 28, 1980) was an Argentine singer, songwriter and actor. He was one of the most popular male vocalists of the 1940s and early 1950s. He was the older brother of Bob Haymes, an actor, television host, and songwriter.

== Early life ==
Haymes was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1918. According to Haymes&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;His father was a rancher of English descent and his Irish mother had been a musical comedy singer. His parents traveled widely and he grew up in France, Montreal, California and Switzerland.&quot;

== Career ==
At the age of 17 Haymes moved to Los Angeles, where he initially worked as a stunt man and film double. Two years later, in 1937, he moved to New York City, where he worked as a vocalist in a number of big bands. By the early 1940s Haymes was singing with the Harry James orchestra.
On September 3, 1942, Frank Sinatra introduced Haymes on radio as his replacement in the Tommy Dorsey band.
In 1945, Haymes co-starred with Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews and Vivian Blaine in the musical &quot;State Fair&quot;. He teamed with female vocalist Helen Forrest for many hit duets during World War II, including &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Buy That Dream&quot;, and &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot;; he sang with Judy Garland on two Decca recordings of songs from the film &quot;The Shocking Miss Pilgrim&quot;, in which he appeared with Betty Grable. From 1944 to 1948, he had his own radio program, &quot;The Dick Haymes Show&quot;, first on NBC and later on CBS.

He paired repeatedly with the Andrews Sisters on a dozen or so Decca collaborations, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; hit &quot;Teresa&quot;, &quot;Great Day&quot;, &quot;My Sin&quot;, and a 1952 rendering of the dramatic ballad &quot;Here in My Heart&quot;, backed by the sisters and Nelson Riddle&#x27;s lush strings. His duets with Patty Andrews were also well received, both on Decca vinyl and on radio&#x27;s &quot;Club Fifteen&quot; with the sisters, which he hosted in 1949 and 1950. He also joined Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters for 1947 session that produced the &quot;Billboard&quot; hit &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, as well as &quot;Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)&quot;. His popular renditions of tender ballads such as &quot;Little White Lies&quot; and &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Because&quot; were recorded with celebrated arranger Gordon Jenkins and his orchestra and chorus.

== World War II and attempted deportation ==
Haymes&#x27;s birth in Argentina to non-U.S. citizens meant he was not an American citizen. In order to avoid military service during World War II, Haymes asserted his nonbelligerent status as a citizen of Argentina, which remained neutral until almost the end of the war. Hollywood-based columnists Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper questioned Haymes&#x27; patriotism, but the story had little effect on his career. About that time, he was classified 4-F by the draft board because of hypertension. As part of his draft examination, he was confined for a short period to a hospital on Ellis Island, which confirmed his diagnosis of hypertension.

In 1953 Haymes went to Hawaii (then still a territory of the United States) to visit actress Rita Hayworth, whom he later married. On returning to the U. S. mainland in August he was arrested for deportation under the McCarran–Walter Act for refusing to enter U.S. military service, and therefore was not entitled to live in the country. He appealed, and won his battle to remain in 1955 on the basis that Hawaii was a geographical part of the United States, and thus had never left it.

== Personal life ==

Haymes experienced alcoholism and had serious financial problems later in life, by the early 1960s declaring bankruptcy with $500,000 in debts.

He appeared as unscrupulous doctor Elroy Gantman in a 1974 episode of the TV show &quot;Adam-12&quot;.

Through his mother&#x27;s nationality, Haymes spent his last years as an Irish citizen.

=== Marriages ===
Haymes was married six times. His first marriage to Edith Harper (1939) occurred when she claimed to be pregnant but was annulled after it was discovered that she was not. Haymes&#x27;s wives included film actresses Joanne Dru (1941–1949), Nora Eddington (a former wife of Errol Flynn) (1949–1953), Rita Hayworth (1953–1955), and Fran Jeffries (1958–1964). Haymes had a total of six children—three with Joanne Dru, one with Fran Jeffries, and two with his sixth and final wife, British model Wendy Smith (1966).

== Death ==
Haymes died from lung cancer on March 28, 1980, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 61 years old.

<text>Frisco is a small unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) on the barrier island of Hatteras Island, between the villages of Buxton and Hatteras. It is located in Dare County, North Carolina, United States, and was previously named &quot;Trent&quot;, or &quot;Trent Woods&quot;, but received a new name with the coming of the post office in 1898. Most of the land is taken by houses available for rental during the summer months, and as such the community&#x27;s population varies seasonally. As of the 2020 census, the population is 994. North Carolina Highway 12 serves as the primary road in Frisco and connects the community to others on the island.

Billy Mitchell Airport is located in Frisco and was named after former Army General Billy Mitchell. Across the street from the small, local airfield is the Frisco Native American Museum.

The residents of Frisco are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. Frisco is part of District 4, along with Avon, Buxton, Hatteras, Rodanthe, Waves and Salvo.

<doc id="1060851" wikidata="Q221353" url="?curid=1060851" title="Arabia Petraea">
<text>Arabia Petraea or Petrea, also known as Rome&#x27;s Arabian Province or simply Arabia, was a frontier province of the Roman Empire beginning in the 2nd century. It consisted of the former Nabataean Kingdom in the southern Levant, the Sinai Peninsula, and the northwestern Arabian Peninsula. Its capital was Petra. It was bordered on the north by Syria, on the west by Judaea (merged with Syria from AD 135) and Egypt, and on the south and east by the rest of Arabia, known as Arabia Deserta and Arabia Felix.

The territory was annexed by Emperor Trajan, like many other eastern frontier provinces of the Roman Empire, but held onto, unlike Armenia, Mesopotamia and Assyria, well after Trajan&#x27;s rule, its desert frontier being called the Limes Arabicus. It produced the Emperor Philippus, who was born around 204. As a frontier province, it included a desert populated by Arabic tribes, and bordering the Parthian hinterland.

Though subject to eventual attack and deprivation by the Parthians and Palmyrenes, it had nothing like the constant incursions faced in other areas on the Roman frontier, such as Germany and North Africa, or the entrenched cultural presence that defined the other more Hellenized eastern provinces.

== Geography ==

The geographic makeup of Arabia has some variation. It includes the comparatively fertile Moab plateau, which received 200mm of annual rainfall, at the southernmost tip of which lies Petra which, along with Bostra (or Busra), together constitute the political foci of the province.

Inhospitability is the norm, though, and along with the desert proper that is the Sinai, the arid Negev, which extends north of the Sinai, is practically such. Along with this are the coastal areas around the Red Sea; the badlands known as Hismā that develop to the north of that coast; and the ever-present rocky terrain.

== Major cities ==
Most of Arabia&#x27;s territories were sparsely populated, as urban settlements was concentrated to the north toward the Jordan river and the region of Hauran. In addition to Petra, major cities included Bosra, Jerash (Gerasa), Canatha, Adraa, Maximianopolis, Philippopolis and Amman (Philadelphia). The only major sea port was Aqaba, at the tip of the wide Gulf of Aqaba at the Red Sea. 

In AD 106, when Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital. Petra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system. The old city of Petra was the capital of the Eastern Roman province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century.

Petra served as the base for Legio III Cyrenaica, and the governor of the province would spend time in both cities, issuing edicts from both.

== History ==
=== Roman conquest ===
Before Roman control in 106 AD, the area had been ruled by Rabbel II, last king of the Nabataeans, who had ruled since 70 AD. When he died, the Third Cyrenaica legion moved north from Egypt into Petra, while the Sixth Ferrata legion, a Syrian garrison unit, moved south to occupy Bostra. The conquest of Nabataea can be best described as casual, an act by Trajan to consolidate control of the area before acting on his designs for territory across the Tigris and eventually into Mesopotamia proper.

There is no evidence of any pretext for the annexation: Rabbel II had an heir by the name of Obodas and though there was little fighting (attested to by the fact that Trajan did not adopt the appellation &quot;Arabicus&quot;), there does seem to have been enough of a defeat to humiliate the Nabataeans. The two cohorts that eventually found themselves in Arabia had sailed from Egypt to Syria in preparation for the action. Apart from some units of the Nabataean royal guard, this seems not to have been strongly resisted, as suggested by the fact that some Nabataean troops served as auxiliary Roman troops shortly after the conquest.

The conquest of Arabia was not officially celebrated until completion of the Via Nova Traiana. This road extended down the center of the province from Bostra to Aqaba. It was not until the project was finished that coins, featuring Trajan&#x27;s bust on the obverse and a camel on the reverse, appeared commemorating the acquisition of Arabia. These coins were minted until 115, at which time the Roman imperial focus was turning farther eastward.

The road linked not only Bostra and Aqaba, which other than being a port does not seem to have held much significance to the imperial government, but also Petra, which sat at the center of the province, between the road&#x27;s two termini. Though Trajan declared Bostra to be the capital of the province, he also awarded Petra the status of metropolis, as a sign that he agreed about its importance with his successor, Hadrian, who considered it to be dignified and historic.

In the 1960s and 1970s, evidence was discovered that Roman legions occupied Mada&#x27;in Salih under Trajan in the Hijaz mountain area of northeastern Arabia, increasing the extension of the Arabia Petraea province south.

=== Romanization ===
With Roman conquest came the imposition of Latin and Greek in official discourse. This was standard for a province in Eastern Rome, but Arabia had far less of the history of Hellenization and Romanization than its neighbors, and the Greek language was little used before its introduction by the Romans. After the conquest, though, Greek was adopted popularly, as well as officially, practically supplanting Nabataean and Aramaic, as evidenced by inscriptions at Umm al Quttain. The occurrence of Latin in the province was rare and limited to such cases as the tomb inscription of Lucius Aninius Sextius Florentinus, governor in 127, and, somewhat paradoxically, in personal names.

Millar makes a case for a Graeco-Roman Hellenization in Arabia. It is an area, after all, that was not significantly hellenized during the rule of Alexander, and the locals originally spoke their native language, not Greek. So with the introduction of Roman rule, along with many aspects of classic Roman socialization, such as public works and glorification of the military, came an introduction of some Greek cultural and social values. Arabia acclimated to the new culture so fully that it seems the original linguistic groups faded away. There were scattered Nabataean inscriptions during the period of imperial Roman rule.

The Era of Bostra, a year numbering system specific to the province, was introduced. Its year one began on the date corresponding to 22 March 106 AD.

=== Arabia during the late Roman Empire ===
When Avidius Cassius rebelled against what he believed was a deceased Marcus Aurelius, he received no support from Arabia province, overlooked by some historians likely due to the fact that Arabia did not have the wealth or political might of Syria. Arabia responded similarly when the governor of Syria, Pescennius Niger, proclaimed himself emperor in 193.

When Septimius Severus rose to power and stripped the Syrian city of Antioch of its status as Metropolis for its part in the rebellion and meted out punishment to any others who were unlucky enough to choose the wrong side, the Third Cyrenaica received the honorific &quot;Severiana&quot;. In addition, the governor of Arabia, Publius Aelius Severianus Maximus, was allowed to continue in his post in reward for his loyalty. Syria was later split into two and Arabia was expanded to include the Lajat and Jebel Drūz, rough terrain south of Damascus, and also the birthplace of M. Julius Phillipus, better known as Philip the Arab.

Severus had enlarged a province that was already huge. He then proceeded to enlarge the empire through the conquest of Mesopotamia. The transfer of the Leja’ and Jebel Drūz seemed to have been part of a shrewd series of political acts on the emperor&#x27;s part to consolidate control of the area before this conquest. Arabia became the ideological power base for Septemius Severus in the Roman Near East. The obvious need to mitigate and tame the power of the province of Syria, which had shown itself over and over to be a hotbed of rebellion, was then accomplished in three parts: The reorganization of Syria into two political units, the reduction of its territory in favor of Arabia, and the marriage of the emperor to the shrewd Julia Domna.

Arabia became such a symbol of loyalty to Severus and the empire that during his war against Clodius Albinus, in Gaul, Syrian opponents propagated a rumour that the Third Cyrenaica had defected. That it would matter to an issue in Gallia that a single legion in a backwater province on the other side of the empire would rebel indicates the political sway that Arabia had amassed. Not a land of significant population, or resources or even strategic position, it had become a bedrock of Roman culture. That it was an Eastern Roman culture did not seem to dilute this importance in the west. It is precisely because Arabia had so little that it was able to define itself as Roman and that spurred its loyalty to Imperial Rome.

With Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s restructuring of the empire in 284–305, Arabia province was enlarged to include parts of modern-day Israel. Arabia after Diocletian became a part of the Diocese of the East, which was part of the Prefecture of Oriens.

=== Byzantine rule ===
As part of the Diocese of the East, Arabia became a frontline in the Byzantine-Sassanid Wars. In the 5th or 6th century it was transformed into Palaestina Salutaris.

<text>Fiber metal laminate (FML) is one of a class of metallic materials consisting of a laminate of several thin metal layers bonded with layers of composite material. This allows the material to behave much as a simple metal structure, but with considerable specific advantages regarding properties such as metal fatigue, impact, corrosion resistance, fire resistance, weight savings, and specialized strength properties.

During the past decades, increasing demand in aircraft industry for high-performance, lightweight structures have stimulated a strong trend towards the development of refined models for fiber metal laminates (FMLs). Fiber metal laminates are hybrid composite materials built up from interlacing layers of thin metals and fiber reinforced adhesives. The most well known FMLs are:

* ARALL (aramid reinforced aluminum laminate), based on aramid fibers
* GLARE (glass reinforced aluminum laminate), based on high-strength glass fibers
* CentrAl, which surrounds a GLARE core with thicker layers of aluminum 
* CARALL (carbon reinforced aluminum laminate), based on carbon fibers

Taking advantage of the hybrid nature from their two key constituents: metals (mostly aluminum) and fiber-reinforced laminate, these composites offer several advantages such as better damage tolerance to fatigue crack growth and impact damage especially for aircraft applications. Metallic layers and fiber reinforced laminate can be bonded by classical techniques, i.e. mechanically and adhesively. Adhesively bonded FMLs have been shown to be far more fatigue resistant than equivalent mechanically bonded structures.

Being mixtures of monolithic metals and composite materials, FMLs belong to the class of heterogeneous mixtures.

Examples of FMLs include aramid fibers, GLARE, and basalt aluminum infusion (B.Al.i).

<text>The Alabama Steeldogs, originally known as the Birmingham Steeldogs, were incorporated in 2000 as one of the charter teams in the AF2, the developmental league of the Arena Football League. Entering their eighth season as of 2007, they were the longest running of many professional football franchises in the city of Birmingham. Management announced that it would not field a team in 2008 but had hopes of returning in 2009. But the team&#x27;s front office has since been dissolved, and with no announcements of further plans, the team is defunct.

The team&#x27;s first head coach was former University of Alabama standout Bobby Humphrey. In October 2005, Ron Selesky, formerly of the Arena Football League&#x27;s Columbus Destroyers, Carolina Cobras and Tampa Bay Storm, as well as the AF2&#x27;s Albany Conquest and Louisville Fire, was hired as the team&#x27;s second coach.

The team played its home games at the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Complex Arena in downtown Birmingham. The arena was the site of the first AF2 game in 2000, between the Steeldogs and the Tennessee Valley Vipers, based in Huntsville, Alabama.

The team&#x27;s colors were black, orange, and white. The team&#x27;s name — unique in all of sports — paid tribute to Birmingham&#x27;s steel industry.

The team&#x27;s logo, depicting a dog with a spiked collar and metal lower jaw, represents &quot;Rusty&quot;, the team&#x27;s mascot. The team&#x27;s cheerleaders were known as the &quot;Showsteelers.&quot;

==Team history==

===Beginnings===
On April 20, 1999, Birmingham&#x27;s franchise was one of the charter teams in the Xtreme Football League, which soon brokered a deal with the more-established Arena Football League to form the latter&#x27;s second tier. Christened &quot;Arena Football 2&quot; or &quot;AF2&quot; for short, the new league would play by the same rules patented by its parent organization.

After a contest, the team became the &quot;Steeldogs&quot;, paying homage to the steel industry that helped grow the city into an industrial giant during the early 20th century.

At a press conference on August 12, 1999, the team&#x27;s name, logo, colors and head coach were all introduced. Humphrey, the University of Alabama&#x27;s second all-time leading rusher, would be the team&#x27;s first coach.

The first Steeldogs ownership group, consisting of Charles Felix, David Berkman and Bruce Burge, also owned the Birmingham Bulls hockey franchise. Both teams were to compete and be headquartered at the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Complex in downtown Birmingham.

On January 11, 2000, the Commissioner of the AF2, Mary Ellen Garling announced the league would kick off its inaugural season at the BJCC Arena on March 31, 2000. The Steeldogs first opponent would be the Tennessee Valley Vipers, Birmingham&#x27;s neighbor 100 miles to the north in Huntsville.

===First season (2000)===
The inaugural game was played before 14,831 fans and a regional television audience in the BJCC Arena on March 31, 2000. The game was a tremendous hit and is ranked 3rd in the league&#x27;s largest regular season crowds. The scoreboard, as is typical in arena football, got quite a workout. Tennessee Valley won the first game in the series, 59-18.

Birmingham&#x27;s first win came one week later at the BJCC, as the Steeldogs shut down the Greensboro Prowlers 18-7 in one of the lowest scoring games in the history of Arena Football.

Birmingham would finish the year with a 7-9 final record. In addition to the win over the Prowlers, Birmingham racked up victories over Roanoke (twice), Richmond, Tallahassee, Arkansas and Tulsa. The Steeldogs’ win over Tallahassee, an 86-74 barnburner, still ranks as the fourth-highest scoring game in AF2 history.

By the end of the first season, 71,402 fans had crossed the turnstiles.

===Second season (2001)===
The second season of Steeldogs football brought the team&#x27;s second ownership group. Steve and Kathryn Umberger purchased the team on December 13, 2000. The couple also purchased the AF2&#x27;s Jacksonville Tomcats in the same year, but he decided that Birmingham would be his more &quot;hands-on&quot; investment. Humphrey was retained as the team&#x27;s head coach for a second season.

The league expanded nearly twofold in 2001 as 28 teams took the field in 2001. Birmingham opened their season at the CenturyTel Center in Bossier City, La., against the expansion Bossier City BattleWings. Birmingham won a thrilling overtime affair, 63-57. It was the first of three consecutive wins to open the 2001 season.

The Steeldogs finished the regular-season 12-4, earning them their first postseason trip. Birmingham traveled to Richmond, Virginia to face the Richmond Speed on July 21, 2001. Despite reaching the 60-point plateau, a feat that Coach Humphrey stressed in every game, the Steeldogs collapsed in the fourth quarter and fell 67-60.

2002 was the beginning of years of stability in the executive office. The Umbergers sold the franchise to two local men, both of whom were well-acquainted with Birmingham&#x27;s professional sports history. Buddy King and Scott Myers became the majority and minority owners of the team on January 2, 2002. The two had met when King played with and Myers marketed for the Birmingham Fire of the World League of American Football. The pair was anxious to parlay the Steeldogs’ early success into a third season. They retained Humphrey for a third year.

===Third season (2002)===
Adopting the motto &quot;One Team, One Goal&quot;, Birmingham set out to make a playoff run in their third season. After an early loss at Tulsa, Birmingham rebounded to win eight of their next nine games before dropping three of their next four. The Steeldogs ended the regular-season with an 11-5 record, good enough to earn a trip to Huntsville to face the Vipers in the first round of the playoffs at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville. There the &#x27;Dogs cast off three years of frustration at the hands of their fiercest rival, dominating Tennessee Valley in a 65-51 victory. Almost secondary to the outcome of the game was the fact that the Steeldogs had now earned themselves a trip to Tulsa, Oklahoma, for a second-round match-up against the top-ranked team in AF2.

On August 10, 2002 Birmingham pulled off the biggest upset in team history. The Steeldogs thoroughly dominated the league&#x27;s top-ranked team, handing them their first home loss in 18 games (a streak that started in 2000 with a seven-point victory over Birmingham) and also exacting revenge for the team&#x27;s opening night loss. The Steeldogs returned home to host the Peoria Pirates in the National Conference Championship game on August 17, 2002, the winner of which would host the ArenaCup. But the Pirates surprised the Steeldogs with a first-half offensive clinic on their way to a 79-33 victory. The game enjoyed the 4th largest playoff attendance in league history.

The 2002 off-season was much less chaotic than in previous years as Humphrey was retained once again and, for the first time in team history, so was the ownership group.

===Fourth season (2003)===
Injuries plagued the 2003 edition of the Birmingham Steeldogs, as the team struggled to field a healthy and consistent quarterback. After two early season victories at home, the Steeldogs fell at Macon in the first road contest of the year. The team dropped four of their next five games, with the one bright exception being a 38-35 overtime victory over the Florida Firecats at Fort Myers.

After three straight victories in the middle of the season, the team dropped five of the last six games to close out the year. Injuries riddled the team from the offensive line, to the quarterback position, to wide receivers and defensive backs. Humphrey and his team limped into the off-season, where he was rewarded for his efforts with his fourth contract extension. He was about to become the longest-tenured coach in the history of AF2 football.

===Fifth season (2004)===

The Steeldogs rebounded nicely to begin the 2004 season. After an opening-night loss at Bossier City, a game in which the Steeldogs’ starting quarterback was hurt on the first play of the second half, Birmingham reeled off six straight victories on the arm of backup quarterback Jeff Aaron. But inconsistency at the quarterback position, along with several key injuries cooled the Steeldogs in the second half of the 2004 regular-season. Birmingham limped into the postseason with a 10-6 record, falling in the first round at Cape Fear, North Carolina, 54-53.

Humphrey and the King-Myers ownership combo stuck around for 2005. Humphrey, who had been inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, had become the AF2&#x27;s all-time winningest coach in 2004. The team&#x27;s 59-58 win over the Rio Grande Valley Dorados on June 26, 2004 gave Humphrey his 47th victory, making him tops among all current and prior head coaches through the 2004 season.
===Sixth season (2005)===

The Steeldogs kicked off the 2005 regular season with a marquee player signing. Andrew Zow, the all-time leading passer at the University of Alabama, joined the team on March 15, 2005. He had signed with the team in 2004 for one game as an emergency quarterback at the behest of Coach Humphrey, but did not see any action. He had not competed on a regular basis since his senior year at Alabama in 2001 and did not see action in the team&#x27;s first game, a home loss to the San Diego Riptide, but finally took the field a week later at Macon. Zow was remarkably efficient in his first contest, finishing 20 of 36 for 273 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. He also ran for a touchdown. Zow&#x27;s season ended a week later when he suffered a leg injury in the following week&#x27;s game at home versus the eventual league champion Memphis Xplorers.

Much like Zow&#x27;s arena football career, the 2005 Steeldogs season never fully got off the ground. The quarterback position changed hands six times during the year. The offensive and defensive lines, hampered by injuries dating back to early season workout camps, never quite jelled into a functioning unit. The defense allowed an average of nearly 56 points per game, worst in the league. The Steeldogs finished with a 2-14 record, dead last in the AF2. The lowly record cost Humphrey his job; he was relieved of his coaching duties on August 9, 2005. Humphrey finished his six-year career as the longest-tenured coach in the league&#x27;s history, as well as its second-most victorious.

===Seventh season (2006)===
On October 4, 2005, Ron Selesky was selected as the second head coach in the history of the Birmingham Steeldogs. He led the team to an improved 7-9 mark in the 2006 season, good for fourth place in the Southern Division. Birmingham lost both games played to the Tennessee Valley Vipers in 2006, accounting for two of the Vipers&#x27; three overall wins.

On December 11, 2006, the Steeldogs&#x27; management team changed the team&#x27;s name from the Birmingham Steeldogs to the Alabama Steeldogs, in an effort to broaden the team&#x27;s appeal to the city&#x27;s more-affluent suburbs and exurbs. The only change to the team logo was replacing the word &quot;Birmingham&quot; with &quot;Alabama.&quot;

===Eighth season (2007)===
The Steeldogs struggled again, but managed to make the playoffs with a 7-9 record and third place in the division. They lost to Rio Grande Valley in the first round of the playoffs.

After the end of the season, Selesky resigned to move up a level in arena football, taking the position of defensive coordinator and player personnel director of the Grand Rapids Rampage.

==Team deactivated==
On October 26, 2007, owner/managing partner Scott Myers announced that the Steeldogs had collapsed and would not put a team on the field in the 2008 season. Myers had been seeking anyone to help finance the team, but was not able to find one. Myers had guaranteed that the team would return for the 2009 season. But those promises did not come to fruition.

<doc id="1060865" wikidata="Q1564634" url="?curid=1060865" title="Pre-preg">
<text>Pre-preg is a composite material made from &quot;pre-impregnated&quot; fibers and a &quot;partially cured&quot; polymer matrix, such as epoxy or phenolic resin, or even thermoplastic mixed with liquid rubbers or resins. The fibers often take the form of a weave and the matrix is used to bond them together and to other components during manufacture. The thermoset matrix is only partially cured to allow easy handling; this B-Stage material requires cold storage to prevent complete curing. B-Stage pre-preg is always stored in cooled areas since heat accelerates complete polymerization. Hence, composite structures built of pre-pregs will mostly require an oven or autoclave to cure. The main idea behind a pre-preg material is the use of anisotropic mechanical properties along the fibers, while the polymer matrix provides filling properties, keeping the fibers in a single system. 

Pre-preg allows one to impregnate the fibers on a flat workable surface, or rather in an industrial process, and then later form the impregnated fibers to a shape which could prove to be problematic for the hot injection process. Pre-preg also allows one to impregnate a bulk amount of fiber and then store it in a cooled area (below 20 °C) for an extended period of time to cure later. The process can also be time consuming in comparison to the hot injection process and the added value for pre-preg preparation is at the stage of the material supplier.

== Areas of application ==
This technique can be utilized in the aviation industry. As in principle, prepreg has the potential to be processed batch sizes. Despite fiber glass having high applicability in aircraft specifically small aircraft motors, carbon fiber is employed in this type of industry at a higher rate, and the demand for it is increasing. For example, the characterization of Airbus A380 is handled by means of a mass fraction. This mass fraction is about 20%, and the Airbus A350XWB by a mass fraction of about 50% of carbon fiber prepregs. Carbon fiber prepregs have been used in the airfoils of the Airbus fleet for more than 20 years.

The usage of prepreg in automotive industry is used at relatively limited quantities in comparison with other techniques like automated tape lay-up and automated fiber placement. The main reason behind this is the relative high cost of prepreg fibers as well as the compounds used in molds. Example of such materials are bulk moulding compound (BMC) or sheet moulding compound (SMC).

This material is used to make the cockpit doors on the Airbus A320. This material provides bulletproofness.

== Uses of prepregs ==
There are many products that utilize the concept of prepreg among which is the following.

* Motorsport
* Space travel
* Sports equipment
* Sailing
* Orthopedic technology in orthotics as well as in prosthetics
* In electrical engineering as an &quot;intermediate layer&quot; in multilayer circuit boards and as insulating material for electrical machines and transformers
* Rotor blades in wind turbines

== Applicable fiber types ==
There are many fiber types that can be excellent candidates for the preparation of preimpregnated fibers. The most common fibers among these candidates are the following fibers.
* Glass fibers
* Glass cloth
* Basalt fibers
* Carbon fibers
* Aramid fibers

== Matrix ==
One distinguishes the matrix systems according to their hardening temperature and the type of resin. The curing temperature greatly influences the glass transition temperature and thus the operating temperature. Military aircraft mainly use 180 °C systems

== Composition ==
The prepreg matrix consists of a mixture of resin and hardener, in some cases an accelerator. Freezing at -20 °C prevents the resin from reacting with the hardener. If the cold chain is interrupted, the reaction starts and the prepreg becomes unusable. There are also high-temperature prepregs which can be stored for a certain time at room temperature. These prepregs can then be cured only in an autoclave at elevated temperature.

== Resin types ==
It is mainly used resins based on epoxy resin. Vinyl ester-based prepregs are also available. Since vinyl ester resins must be pre-accelerated with amine accelerator or cobalt, their processing time at room temperature is shorter than with epoxy-based prepregs. Catalysts (also called hardeners) include peroxides such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP), acetyl acetone peroxide (AAP) or cyclohexanone peroxide (CHP). Vinyl ester resin is used under high impact stress.

== Resin properties ==
The properties of the resin and fiber constituents influence the evolution of VBO (vacuum-bag-only) prepreg microstructures during cure. Generally, however, fiber properties and fiber bed architectures are standardized, whereas matrix properties drive both prepreg and process development. The dependence of microstructural evolution on resin properties, therefore, is critical to understand, and has been investigated by numerous authors. The presence of dry prepreg areas may suggest a need for low viscosity resins. However, Ridgard explains that VBO prepreg systems are designed to remain relatively viscous in the early stages of cure to impede infiltration and allow sufficient dry areas to persist for air evacuation to occur. Because the room temperature vacuum holds used to evacuate air from VBO systems are sometimes measured in hours or days, it is critical for the resin viscosity to inhibit &quot;cold flow&quot;, which could prematurely seal the air evacuation pathways. However, the overall viscosity profile must also permit sufficient flow at cure temperature to fully impregnate the prepreg, lest pervasive dry areas remain in the final part. Furthermore, Boyd and Maskell argue that to inhibit bubble formation and growth at low consolidation pressures, both the viscous and elastic characteristics of the prepreg must be tuned to the specific processing parameters encountered during cure, and ultimately ensure that a majority of the applied pressure is transferred to the resin. Altogether, the rheological evolution of VBO resins must balance the reduction of both voids caused by entrapped gases and voids caused by insufficient flow.

== Processing ==
At room temperatures the resin reacts very slowly and if frozen will remain stable for years. Thus, prepregs can only be cured at high temperatures. They can be processed with the hot pressing technique or the autoclave technique. Through pressure the fiber volume fraction is increased in both techniques.

The best qualities can be produced with the autoclave technique. The combination of pressure and vacuum results in components with very low air inclusions.

The curing can be followed by a tempering process, which serves for complete crosslinking.

==Material advances==
Recent advances in out of autoclave (OOA) processes hold promise for improving performance and lowering costs for composite structures. Using vacuum-bag-only (VBO) for atmospheric pressures, the new OOA processes promise to deliver less than 1 percent void content required for aerospace primary structures. Led by material scientists at Air Force Research Lab, the technique would save the costs of constructing and installing large structure autoclaves ($100M saved at NASA) and making small production runs of 100 aircraft economically viable.

<doc id="1060866" wikidata="Q3787174" url="?curid=1060866" title="How Europe Underdeveloped Africa">
<text>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa is a 1972 book written by Walter Rodney that describes how Africa was deliberately exploited and underdeveloped by European colonial regimes. One of his main arguments throughout the book is that Africa developed Europe at the same rate that Europe underdeveloped Africa.

Rodney argues that a combination of power politics and economic exploitation of Africa by Europeans led to the poor state of African political and economic development evident in the late 20th century. Though, he did not intend &quot;to remove the ultimate responsibility for development from the shoulders of Africans... [He believes that] every African has a responsibility to understand the [capitalist] system and work for its overthrow.&quot;

This book, along with Frantz Fanon&#x27;s &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, is a popular example of 20th century books concerning African development and post-colonial theory.

== Background ==
First published in London by Bogle-L&#x27;Ouverture Publications in 1972 (in partnership with Tanzanian Publishing House), the book shaped the study of Africa in many disciplines. Rodney wrote the text during his time in Dar es Salaam, during the presidency of Julius Nyerere. Tanzanian scholar Karim F Hirji has described the work as, &quot;no doubt the 20th century&#x27;s most important and influential book on African history.&quot; 

== Synopsis ==
Rodney argues that to fully appreciate and understand the effect of European exploitation on Africa, four distinct issues need to be addressed: a reconstruction of pre-European Africa&#x27;s developmental condition, that of pre-expansionist Europe, and their contributions to each other&#x27;s present condition, developed or otherwise. After an introductory chapter in which he definitionally discusses development, underdevelopment, and associated terminologies in their historical and contemporary contexts, he devotes a chapter to each of these four issues. He concludes the book with a chapter critiquing arguments that promote the &quot;supposed benefit of colonialism&quot;. In this chapter, he also explains the means through which colonialism is linked to Africa&#x27;s present underdevelopment.

<text>Coppin State University (Coppin) is a public historically black university in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is part of the University System of Maryland and a member of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

==History==
Coppin State University was founded in 1900 at what was then called Colored High School (later named Douglass High School) on Pennsylvania Avenue by the Baltimore City School Board. It first had a one-year training course for the preparation of African-American elementary school teachers. By 1902, the training program was expanded to a two-year Normal Department within the high school. Seven years later it was separated from the high school and given its own principal.

In 1926, this facility for teacher training was named Fanny Jackson Coppin Normal School in honor of an African-American woman who was a pioneer in teacher education, Fanny Jackson Coppin.

By 1938 the curriculum of the normal school was lengthened to four years, authority was given for the granting of the Bachelor of Science degree, and the name of the Normal School was changed to Coppin Teachers College. In 1950, Coppin became part of the higher education system of Maryland under the State Department of Education, and renamed Coppin State Teachers College. Two years later, Coppin moved to its present site on West North Avenue.
In acknowledgment of the goals and objectives of the college, the Board of Trustees ruled in 1963 that the institution&#x27;s degree-granting authority would no longer be restricted to teacher education. Following this ruling, Coppin was officially renamed Coppin State College, and in 1967 the first Bachelor of Arts degree was conferred. In 1988, the College became part of the newly organized University of Maryland System (now the University System of Maryland.) The school was officially renamed Coppin State University on April 13, 2004.

Coppin&#x27;s first president (1930–1956) was Miles Connor. He was succeeded by Parlett Moore in 1956, who served until Calvin W. Burnett took over as Coppin&#x27;s third president in 1970. Burnett served the institution for 33 years, until Coppin&#x27;s fourth president, Stanley F. Battle, was appointed on March 3, 2003. After Battle departed for North Carolina A&amp;T State University in 2007, Coppin&#x27;s fifth president, Reginald Avery, was hired. He announced his resignation effective January 22, 2013. Mortimer H. Neufville became the university&#x27;s sixth president on January 23, after Avery stepped down. Maria Thompson became the university&#x27;s seventh and first woman president on July 1, 2015. Following her retirement in June 2019, Mickey L. Burnim was appointed interim president until May 2020. Anthony L. Jenkins was appointed Coppin State University&#x27;s eighth president on May 26, 2020.

In 2022, after Andrew Jackson School in Philadelphia changed its name to Fanny Jackson Coppin School, Coppin State University offered free tuition to Coppin School graduates.

==Academics==
Coppin State University is classified among &quot;Master&#x27;s Colleges &amp; Universities: Small Programs&quot; and institutionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Specific programs are accredited by the Commission on Nursing Education (CCNE), the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE), the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), and the Commission on Accreditation of Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM). Additionally, the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) accredits the College of Business.

CSU offers undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs through the following colleges:
*College of Arts &amp; Sciences, and Education
*College of Behavioral &amp; Social Sciences
*College of Business
*College of Health Professions

Coppin has offered a selective honors program since 1981 for high-performing undergraduate students. The honors program students live on the same floor in the Daley building and are recipients of one or more scholarships.

==Student activities==
There are over 30 student organizations on campus.

===Athletics===

The Coppin State Eagles compete in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and in the NCAA Division I. The school has men&#x27;s teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, tennis, indoor and outdoor track and field, and women&#x27;s teams in basketball, bowling, cross country, softball, tennis, indoor and outdoor track and field, and volleyball.

In 1997, the Coppin State men&#x27;s basketball team defeated the University of South Carolina in the opening round of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship becoming just the third #15 seed to defeat a #2 seed. In the 2007–08 season, Coppin State became the first team in NCAA College Basketball history to reach the NCAA Tournament with 20 losses.

Under the direction of Coach Leon Stewart, Coppin State began breaking school records in bowling, which is one of its newer teams. In 2012, the Eagles signed two premier women bowlers, Kache Woods and Kristen Sharpe. The 2013 recruiting class included Woods and Sharpe, along with Erica Washington, Loren Johnson, and Heather Josker. With this influx of talent, the 2013 Eagles broke the school record for most wins. The Eagles upped that performance in 2014 once again as they set a Coppin State record for wins in a season.

===Greek life===
Coppin State actively has all nine National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) organizations present on campus.

<text>Patrick Joseph Garrity (born August 23, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played from 1998 to 2008 in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A power forward who was known as a three-point marksman, Garrity played for the Phoenix Suns and the Orlando Magic. He served as an assistant general manager of the Detroit Pistons from 2016 to 2020.

==Early life==
At Lewis-Palmer High School in Monument, Colorado, Garrity was a starter on the basketball team for four seasons and won all-state honors three times. He led the basketball team to the 1994 Class 4A State of Colorado Championship and was valedictorian of his graduating class. Garrity averaged 23.2 points per game in his senior year. His jersey, number 53, is retired at Lewis-Palmer High School.

==College career==
At the University of Notre Dame, Garrity played four years with the Fighting Irish averaging double-digits in scoring in all four seasons, including a 23.2 point-per-game average in his senior season of 1997–98. He was the Big East Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year in 1997. In 1998, he was a Consensus Second Team All-America selection. He was a two-time Academic All-America selection as well as Academic All-American of the Year for Division I men&#x27;s basketball in 1998.

==Professional career==
Garrity was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 19th pick of the 1998 NBA draft. The Bucks traded his rights and the rights to Dirk Nowitzki, to the Dallas Mavericks for the rights to Robert Traylor. Garrity&#x27;s rights, along with Martin Müürsepp, Bubba Wells, and a first-round draft pick, were traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Steve Nash.

A power forward, Garrity was known for his three-point marksmanship during his NBA career.

In Phoenix, Garrity averaging 5.6 points per game in 39 appearances (in an NBA lockout-shortened 50-game regular season). On August 5, 1999, he was traded—along with Danny Manning and two future draft picks—to the Orlando Magic for Penny Hardaway. Garrity spent the rest of his playing career with the Magic.

Garrity played in all 82 games with Orlando in 1999–2000, averaging 8.2 points per game and shooting 40.1 percent from three-point territory. In the 2000–2001 season, he averaged 8.3 points per game in 76 games. In February 2001, Garrity had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. In 2001–02, Garrity&#x27;s scoring average hit a career-high of 11.1 points per game as he started 43 of the 80 games he played. On March 19, 2002, in a 101–91 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, Garrity made a career-high seven three-pointers on his way to a 21-point total. During the season, he ranked seventh in the NBA in both three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made. Garrity&#x27;s average dipped to 10.7 points per game in 2002–03. That season, on November 2, 2002, Garrity scored 13 points and grabbed a career-high 15 rebounds in a 100–90 win over the Bucks. Garrity participated in the 2001 and 2003 Three-Point Contests during NBA All-Star Weekend.

Beginning in 2003, Garrity&#x27;s career was affected by right knee problems. Garrity&#x27;s 2003–04 campaign ended after only two games due to an injured right knee. He underwent three different knee procedures in 2003 before undergoing microfracture surgery in 2004. Garrity came back to play in 71 games for the Magic during the 2004–2005 season, averaging 4.6 points per game. In April 2005, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee and was ruled out for the rest of the season.

Garrity served as secretary/treasurer of the National Basketball Players Association.

On January 26, 2006, Garrity scored 24 points in a 119–115 overtime win against the Philadelphia 76ers. On September 11, 2008, he announced his retirement from professional basketball.

==Post-playing career==
Garrity worked for Bridgewater Associates before returning to the NBA as director of strategic planning for the Detroit Pistons. On June 15, 2016, Garrity was promoted and became the assistant general manager of the Detroit Pistons. Garrity left the position in July 2020.

<doc id="1060880" wikidata="Q346751" url="?curid=1060880" title="Cha Bum-kun">
<text>Cha Bum-kun (; or ; born 22 May 1953) is a South Korean former football manager and player. A forward, he was nicknamed Tscha Bum or &quot;Cha Boom&quot; in Germany because of his name and thunderous ball striking ability. He showed explosive pace and powerful shots with his thick thighs. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Asian footballers of all time.

In 1972, Cha had been capped for the South Korea national team as the youngest player of the time at the age of 18. He is the youngest player to ever reach 100 international caps in the world at 24 years and 35 days, and the all-time leading goalscorer of the South Korean national team with 58 goals. After dominating Asian competitions including the 1978 Asian Games, he left for West Germany and played for Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen. He scored a total of 121 goals in two Bundesliga clubs, and won the UEFA Cup with each team.

After his retirement, he opened a football academy to develop youth players in South Korea, and managed the national team for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

==Early life==
Cha was born in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi. He originally joined Yeongdo Middle School to learn football, but the school&#x27;s football club was dissolved as soon as he joined there. He started his football career by transferring to Kyungshin Middle School after playing field hockey for Yeongdo for one and a half years. In his high school days, he tried to leave school due to older students&#x27; violence, but continued to play football with the manager Chang Woon-soo&#x27;s help. He became a notable player of Kyungshin High School, and was selected for the South Korean under-20 team in 1970.

== Club career ==
=== Career in South Korea ===
Cha entered Korea University in 1972, and won the Korean National Championship in 1974, the predecessor of the Korean FA Cup. After his graduation, he started his senior career with Korea Trust Bank FC in 1976. He led his team to the title and was named the best player in the spring season of the Korean Semi-professional League. In October 1976, he joined Air Force FC to serve his mandatory military service. Cha originally had a plan to enlist in the Navy FC, but the ROK Air Force persuaded him that it would move his discharge up by six months.

=== Darmstadt 98 ===
While playing for the national team in the 1978 Korea Cup, Cha attracted the attention of an Eintracht Frankfurt coach , who had received an invitation to serve as an scout/observer at that tournament. In November 1978, Schulte sent a letter to the KFA (Korea Football Association), suggesting Cha&#x27;s tryout in West Germany, who would be discharged from the ROK Air Force in January 1979. Cha had taken time off to leave for Frankfurt after the 1978 Asian Games in December and succeeded to contract with another Bundesliga club Darmstadt 98 by signing a six-month deal. However, he spent just less than a month in Darmstadt. The ROK Air Force didn&#x27;t follow the contract with Cha, and ordered his return. After his debut match against VfL Bochum on 30 December, Cha returned to South Korea due to his complicated issue about military service on 5 January. He eventually spent the remainder of the duration of his military service until 31 May, and so could not play for Darmstadt.

=== Eintracht Frankfurt ===
After being discharged from the military service completely, Cha still wanted to play in Bundesliga, and joined Eintracht Frankfurt at age 26 in July 1979. He scored in three consecutive games from third to fifth matchday of the Bundesliga, making an immediate impact early in his new club. After the first half of his first season in Germany, he was classified as world class in the of &quot;kicker&quot;, a notable German football magazine. He was also acclaimed by showing great performances helping Eintracht to win its first-ever UEFA Cup title. He was evaluated as the &quot;unstoppable player&quot; by Sir Alex Ferguson, (Aberdeen&#x27;s manager at the time) and &quot;one of the best attackers in the world&quot; by Lothar Matthäus (an opponent player at the UEFA Cup Final and the Bundesliga). In addition to a UEFA Cup title, he was named along with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Kevin Keegan in the Bundesliga Team of the Season by &quot;kicker&quot;. On 23 August 1980, Cha&#x27;s spine had been cracked by Jürgen Gelsdorf, who had tackled behind him, but came back to the stadium after a month. Afterwards, he scored six goals in six matches of the 1980–81 DFB-Pokal, leading Eintracht to the title. He became Eintracht&#x27;s top goalscorer for three consecutive seasons.

=== Bayer Leverkusen ===
However, Cha transferred to Bayer Leverkusen due to a financial difficulty of Frankfurt in 1983. In the 1985–86 Bundesliga, he scored his most goals in a single Bundesliga season with 17 goals, and Leverkusen qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time as the sixth-placed team. The magazine &quot;kicker&quot; once again selected him for the Team of the Season, and the &quot;&quot; gave him the Player of the Season award. In the 1988 UEFA Cup Final, he scored a dramatic equaliser against Espanyol to tie the game 3–3. Leverkusen eventually went on to win the game on penalties, holding its first European title.

Cha retired in 1989 after playing 308 Bundesliga games as a fair player. During his Bundesliga career, he scored 98 goals without a penalty, and received only one yellow card. On 31 October 1987, he scored his 93rd Bundesliga goal, becoming the top foreign goalscorer by surpassing Willi Lippens. His scoring record wasn&#x27;t broken for eleven years until Stéphane Chapuisat scored more goals than him. As of 2024, Cha is ranked ninth along with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the Bundesliga&#x27;s foreign goalscorer standings.

== International career ==

Cha generally played the Bundesliga games as a striker, but he had originally been a winger in South Korea. He became a South Korean under-20 international in 1970, and took part in the AFC Youth Championship in 1971 and 1972. In the 1972 AFC Asian Cup, he made his senior international debut against Iraq, and scored his first international goal against Khmer Republic. He was named in the Korean FA Best XI for seven consecutive years, and was selected as the Korean FA Player of the Year in 1973.

Cha usually played for the national team in the Korea Cup, Pestabola Merdeka and King&#x27;s Cup, which were annually contested between Asian nations and the invited clubs at the time. He won a total of ten trophies and also left memorable games in three competitions. In the 1975 Pestabola Merdeka, he scored his first international hat-trick against Japan. In the 1976 Korea Cup, he scored a hat-trick against Malaysia during five minutes from 83rd to 88th minute, leading South Korea to a dramatic 4–4 draw.

In the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualification, he played all of South Korea&#x27;s twelve matches, and recorded five goals and two assists, although his knee got a boil during the competition. However, South Korea failed to qualify for the World Cup by finishing the qualification as runners-up despite his struggle.

In the 1978 Asian Games, he scored two goals and provided two assists, contributing to team&#x27;s gold medal. However, he showed lethargic plays to prepare tryouts for Bundesliga clubs, and received criticisms. After the 1978 Asian Games, he left for the Bundesliga and didn&#x27;t play for South Korea. His last international tournament was the 1986 FIFA World Cup, South Korea&#x27;s first World Cup since 1954. He showed exemplary performance in intensive checks by opponents, but failed to prevent South Korea&#x27;s elimination in the group stage.

== Managerial career ==
Cha moved into management with K League side Hyundai Horang-i, coaching them from 1991–94. His next appointment in January 1997 was Korean national team coach and he led the nation to the 1998 FIFA World Cup; however, a disastrous 5–0 defeat at the hands of the Netherlands in Korea&#x27;s second group game got Cha fired. He later blamed the KFA for the bad performance, citing lack of bonuses and alleging pro soccer games in Korea were fixed. The association promptly slapped a five-year ban on him and he soon left the country with his wife.

After an 18-month spell coaching Shenzhen Ping&#x27;an in China, Cha took up a commentator position with MBC in Korea. He returned to coaching in late 2003 when offered the Suwon Samsung Bluewings position. Cha achieved immediate success with Suwon by lifting the 2004 K League championship, an achievement he ranked as even better than the UEFA Cup he won as a player in 1988. He later resigned in June 2010 as Suwon manager.

== Personal life ==
Cha is a devout Christian and said the faith is one of his three biggest values along with family and football.

Cha&#x27;s second child, Cha Du-ri, also played for the South Korean national team and Bundesliga clubs, among them Eintracht, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps.

In November 2019, Cha received the Cross of Merit from the German government.

The KFA is showing the list of Cha&#x27;s 136 international appearances in its official website. The RSSSF is also claiming 136 appearances about Cha&#x27;s international career, but its details have some discrepancies. FIFA registered him with 130 appearances in the FIFA Century Club by excluding six matches in the Summer Olympics qualification.

<doc id="1060887" wikidata="Q6758628" url="?curid=1060887" title="Marden, Kent">
<text>Marden ( or ) is a village and civil parish in the Kent borough of Maidstone approximately south of Maidstone. The civil parish is located on the flood plain of the River Beult, and also includes Chainhurst and the hamlet of Wanshurst Green.

The village is associated with apple growing and from 1933 to 1991 hosted a nationally recognised fruit show.

==History==

===Name===

The dense woodland and marshes of the Weald of Kent were littered with acorns and beech mast in autumn making ideal seasonal foraging ground for pigs. The grants by Saxon kings for rights to these pannage areas were known as &quot;dens&quot; which later came to refer to the herders&#x27; camps and ultimately the settlements that grew up there. &quot;Maer&quot; referred to barren areas of marsh alongside the forest. In time the dens developed into permanent settlements such a &quot;Maer&quot; &quot;den&quot;, or clearing beside the marsh.

By 1066 the settlement was recorded as &quot;Maere Denn&quot;; in 1170, &quot;Maeredaen&quot;; 1235, &quot;Mereden&quot;; 1283, &quot;Merdenne&quot;, and from about 1635 by its present name.

===Parish pump===

Marden Parish Council covered over a well opposite the village&#x27;s Maidstone Road junction in 1899 and erected a pump. In 1907, it had to be locked, and then removed, because of contamination of the water by ammonia, nitrates, chlorides and organic matter. The parish pump is depicted on the village sign.

===Forges===

George Rootes, a relative of the Rootes Group founders, operated Rootes&#x27; Forge at West End, and the West End Tavern next door.

A Mr Bourne ran Bourne&#x27;s Forge in the High Street. After it was demolished, Sutton&#x27;s shop was built on the site and later new housing, the present Sutton Forge.

===French airliner crash===
On 10 February 1930, a Farman F.63 Goliath crashed at Pagehurst emergency landing ground whilst attempting an emergency landing following structural failure of the starboard tailplane. Two of the six people on board were killed.

===Marden Fruit Show===

In 1933, Marden Fruit Show Society was established by 35 top-fruit growers and their first show was held in October that year at Walton Hall on Pattenden Lane. The prize fruit was sent to London for display at Selfridges. Apart from World War II, and bad frost years, the Society has organised their shows annually ever since.

In 1953 Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother attended the show.

Marden Fruit Show is now &quot;The National Fruit Show&quot; and has moved from Pattenden Lane to the Kent Showground at nearby Detling. Entries of apples, pears and cherries come from across Great Britain and mainland Europe.

===Doodlebugs===

On 3 July 1944, a German V-1 flying bomb shot down by anti-aircraft fire landed on an army camp in Pattenden Lane, killing 11 and injuring eight. A total of 11 of the flying bombs fell on Marden including another on Pattenden Lane that exploded in a pond.

===Pluto===

A World War II Pluto fuel pipeline was constructed through Marden parish. In 2016, a section of the pipe from Gatehouse Farm, incorporating a concrete joint to facilitate a change in alignment, was relocated and put on permanent display at Marden Library.

===Rail collision===
On 4 January 1969, a passenger train from to overran a signal at danger in fog and crashed into the back of a parcels train. Four people were killed and 11 injured.

==Transport==

Marden is 8 miles (13 km) from Maidstone and 14 miles (22 km) from Tonbridge. It is on the B2079 linking the A229 Maidstone with the A21 at Flimwell. Marden railway station is on the South Eastern Main Line.

==Economy==

There is local employment at the substantial industrial estate built north of the railway line on Pattenden Lane from 1950 which supplements traditional agricultural jobs, but many residents commute to work in London.

In 1993, there was a substantial tyre dump fire at the Pattenden Lane industrial area that caused pollution of the River Teise.
==Amenities==

St Michael and All Angels Church, depicted on the village sign, was built at the end of the 12th century.

In 2007, Ann Widdecombe opened the Marden Heritage Centre&#x27;s archive at Marden Library.

The village school, Marden Primary Academy, joined the Leigh Academies Trust in 2020.

Marden Village Club was founded in 1907 and offers refreshments, singers and bingo to its members. Across Howland Road from the Village Club is the entrance to Marden Bowls Club&#x27;s green and clubhouse.

===Memorial Hall===

Marden Memorial Hall on Goudhurst Road is operated by a registered charity. The three function rooms host community 
and private events, and since 1974 have staged Marden Theatre Group productions.

The Hall was converted from a former Church School in 1934 and named for the memory of Mr Edward Day.

Between 1950 and 1977 the Memorial Hall accommodated Marden library.

===Sport===

Marden Cricket Club and Marden Russets Hockey Club are based at Day&#x27;s Sport Field.

Marden Minors football team play at Church Park.

===Marden Meadows===

The Marden Meadows Site of Special Scientific Interest is to the east of the village. Kent Trust for Nature Conservation mows the three fields once a year for hay and livestock graze the aftermath. The unimproved, natural grassland contains Ophioglossum, green winged orchid, Saxifraga granulata, Leucanthemum vulgare, Rhinanthus minor, and within a pond Hottonia palustris and bladder-sedge.

<text>In engineering, damage tolerance is a property of a structure relating to its ability to sustain defects safely until repair can be effected. The approach to engineering design to account for damage tolerance is based on the assumption that flaws can exist in any structure and such flaws propagate with usage. This approach is commonly used in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering to manage the extension of cracks in structure through the application of the principles of fracture mechanics. A structure is considered to be damage tolerant if a maintenance program has been implemented that will result in the detection and repair of accidental damage, corrosion and fatigue cracking before such damage reduces the residual strength of the structure below an acceptable limit.

==History==

Structures upon which human life depends have long been recognized as needing an element of fail-safety. When describing his flying machine, Leonardo da Vinci noted that &quot;In constructing wings one should make one chord to bear the strain and a looser one in the same position so that if one breaks under the strain, the other is in the position to serve the same function.&quot;

Prior to the 1970s, the prevailing engineering philosophy of aircraft structures was to ensure that airworthiness was maintained with a single part broken, a redundancy requirement known as fail-safety. However, advances in fracture mechanics, along with infamous catastrophic fatigue failures such as those in the de Havilland Comet prompted a change in requirements for aircraft. It was discovered that a phenomenon known as multiple-site damage could cause many small cracks in the structure, which grow slowly by themselves, to join one another over time, creating a much larger crack, and significantly reducing the expected time until failure 

==Safe-life structure==

Not all structure must demonstrate detectable crack propagation to ensure safety of operation. Some structures operate under the safe-life design principle, where an extremely low level of risk is accepted through a combination of testing and analysis that the part will never form a detectable crack due to fatigue during the service life of the part. This is achieved through a significant reduction of stresses below the typical fatigue capability of the part. Safe-life structures are employed when the cost or infeasibility of inspections outweighs the weight penalty and development costs associated with safe-life structures. An example of a safe-life component is the helicopter rotor blade. Due to the extremely large numbers of cycles endured by the rotating component, an undetectable crack may grow to a critical length in a single flight and before the aircraft lands, result in a catastrophic failure that regular maintenance could not have prevented.

==Damage tolerance analysis==

In ensuring the continued safe operation of the damage tolerant structure, inspection schedules are devised. This schedule is based on many criteria, including:

*assumed initial damaged condition of the structure
*stresses in the structure (both fatigue and operational maximum stresses) that cause crack growth from the damaged condition
*geometry of the material which intensifies or reduces the stresses on the crack tip
*ability of the material to withstand cracking due to stresses in the expected environment
*largest crack size that the structure can endure before catastrophic failure
*likelihood that a particular inspection method will reveal a crack
*acceptable level of risk that a certain structure will be completely failed
*expected duration after manufacture until a detectable crack will form
*assumption of failure in adjacent components which may have the effect of changing stresses in the structure of interest

These factors affect how long the structure may operate normally in the damaged condition before one or more inspection intervals has the opportunity to discover the damaged state and effect a repair. The interval between inspections must be selected with a certain minimum safety, and also must balance the expense of the inspections, the weight penalty of lowering fatigue stresses, and the opportunity costs associated with a structure being out of service for maintenance.

==Non-destructive inspections==

Manufacturers and operators of aircraft, trains, and civil engineering structures like bridges have a financial interest in ensuring that the inspection schedule is as cost-efficient as possible. In the example of aircraft, because these structures are often revenue producing, there is an opportunity cost associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself. Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul. Crack growth, as shown by fracture mechanics, is exponential in nature; meaning that the crack growth rate is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see Paris&#x27; law). This means that only the largest cracks influence the overall strength of a structure; small internal damages do not necessarily decrease the strength. A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has led to the development of non-destructive testing methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include eddy current, ultrasonic, dye penetrant, and X-ray inspections. By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair. As an example, such repair can be achieved by drilling a small hole at the crack tip, thus effectively turning the crack into a keyhole-notch.

<text>John Christopher Glazebrook Hodder-Williams (25 August 1926 – 15 May 1995) was an English musician, songwriter and author, primarily of science fiction. He also wrote novels about aviation and espionage. He was the son of Ralph Hodder-Williams, who was one of the owners of the British publishing firm Hodder and Stoughton. Many of his books are early examples of what would later be called techno-thrillers. He also wrote teleplays, and worked as a composer and lyricist.

== Biography ==
Hodder-Williams was born 25 August 1926, in London. He served in the Royal Corps of Signals from 1944 to 1948, where he served in the Middle East. Afterwards, after briefly working at Hodder and Stoughton, he became a jazz pianist and songwriter on Broadway in the early 1950s. He eventually returned to England, continuing to write songs &amp; perform, before he published his first novel (&quot;The Cummings Report&quot;) in 1958 under the pseudonym James Brogan. His next 14 novels were published under his own name, and varied in genre. Hodder-Williams described some of his work as &quot;fiction science&quot;. He was also a pilot, a theme that appears in several of his early literary works.

Hodder-Williams died on 15 May 1995, in London.

<doc id="1060896" wikidata="Q59781902" url="?curid=1060896" title="Patriarch of Venice">
<text>The Patriarch of Venice (; ) is the ordinary bishop of the Archdiocese of Venice. The bishop is one of only four patriarchs in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church. The other three are the Patriarch of Lisbon, the Patriarch of the East Indies and the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. Presently, the only advantage of this purely formal title is the bishop&#x27;s place of honor in papal processions. In the case of Venice, an additional privilege allows the patriarch, even if he is not a cardinal, the use of the colour red in non-liturgical vestments. In that case, the red biretta is topped by a tuft, as is the custom with other bishops who are not cardinals.

The diocese of Venice was created in 774 as suffragan of the Patriarchate of Grado. It was only in 1451 that, in consideration of the political influence of the city, its bishops were accorded the title of patriarch by the pope.

By a relatively recent tradition, the Patriarch of Venice is created a cardinal at the consistory following his appointment, though nothing requires the pope to do so. The current patriarch Francesco Moraglia has not been made a cardinal.

In the last centuries of the Republic of Venice (to 1797), exceptionally among Catholic bishops, the patriarch was elected by the Venetian Senate, who always chose a member of one of the hereditary patrician families of the city, and usually a layman who was only ordained to take up the patriarchate. The papacy obliged them to pass an examination in theology, though many evaded this. Usually the new patriarch was a Venetian diplomat or administrator, as with Lorenzo Priuli in 1591 or Francesco Vendramin in 1608, though some were career clerics, who had usually been previously in positions in Rome, such as Federico Cornaro in 1631. The patriarchs normally remained in Venice, and in this period none were elected pope. Since the end of the republic, patriarchs have rarely been of Venetian origin, and three of them became pope in the 20th century alone: Pius X (1903), John XXIII (1958) and John Paul I (1978).

==Ecclesiastical history==

===Early history===

The Venetian islands at first belonged to the diocese of Altino or of Padua, under jurisdiction of the archbishop of Aquileia, believed to be the successor of St. Mark. During the Lombard invasion (568–572) many bishops of the invaded mainland escaped under protection of the Byzantine fleet in the eastern lagoons. The archbishop himself took refuge in Grado, where he was claimed as patriarch, during the schism of the Three Chapters. At the end of the invasion, many of the ancient dioceses of the mainland were restored by the Lombards, while the exiles supported the new sees in the lagoons. Two patriarchs emerged: the Patriarchate of Old Aquileia on the mainland and Patriarchate of Grado.

In 774 or 775, Pope Adrian I and John IV, Patriarch of Grado, authorized the establishment of an episcopal see on the island of Olivolo. The first bishop, Obelerius, was nominated, invested and enthroned by the doge and consecrated by the patriarch. The Bishop of Olivolo was subordinate to Grado and had jurisdiction over the islands of Olivolo, Rialto, Luprio, Gemini, Scopulo or Dorsoduro, Spinalonga, Biria and other minor islands of the central group. The diocese&#x27;s cathedral was San Pietro di Castello.
In 828 the body of Saint Mark the Evangelist was smuggled from Alexandria, Egypt, to Venice. When the ship reached Olivolo island in Venice, the saint made signs (or so it was claimed) showing he did not want to be placed in the custody of the bishop. Instead, he was taken to the doge&#x27;s chapel, and planning began to create a magnificent new temple, St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, suitable for such important relics. The legend that St. Mark himself had preached the Gospel at Venice grew up in later times.

In 1074, the Bishop of Olivolo began to be styled the Bishop of Castello. Enrico Contarini was the first to hold this title. In 1084 the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in his Golden Bull recognized the full independence of Venice, along with freedom from tributes, trade restrictions and customs duties.

The Republic of Venice began its Golden Age under the Doge Enrico Dandolo (1192–1205).
Under him the French Crusading army of the Fourth Crusade was used to bring Trieste and Zara under Venetian sway, and then to obtain a large part of the Latin Empire of Constantinople along the east coast of the Adriatic, most of the Peloponnesus and settlements in the Sea of Marmora, the Black Sea and the Aegean.

The relationship between the bishop, the patriarch and the doge was complex. The bishops of Olivolo, and then Castello, were technically suffragans of the Patriarch of Grado. In practice they maintained independence. From the middle of the 11th century the patriarchs took up residence for most of the time at San Silvestro, Venice, while the bishop was based at San Pietro on the east of the city. An important role was played by the &quot;primicerio&quot;, based in Saint Mark&#x27;s, who represented the doge and the city government. The &quot;primicerio&quot; invested the bishops, abbots and patriarchs.

===Patriarchate&#x27;s history===

In 1451, upon the death of Domenico Michel, Patriarch of Grado, Pope Nicholas V suppressed the Patriarchate of Grado and the Diocese of Castello, incorporating them both in the new Patriarchate of Venice by the Papal Bull &quot;Regis aeterni.&quot; Thus Venice succeeded to the whole metropolitan jurisdiction of Grado&#x27;s ecclesiastical province, including the sees of Dalmatia.

In 1466 the territory of the Patriarchate was expanded by merging the suppressed Diocese of Equilio.

The election of the patriarch belonged to the Senate of Venice, and this practice sometimes led to differences between the republic and the Holy See. Likewise, parishioners elected their parish priests, by the right of patronage. Girolamo Quirini, OP (1519–54), had many disputes with the clergy, the Government, and the Holy See. To avoid these disputes, the Senate decreed that in future only senators should be eligible. Those elected after this were frequently laymen. Giovanni Trevisan, OSB (1560), introduced the Tridentine reforms, founding the seminary, holding synods and collecting the regulations made by his predecessors (Constitutiones et privilegia patriarchatus et cleri Venetiarum). In 1581 the &quot;visita Apostolica&quot; was sent to Venice; a &quot;libellus exhortatorius&quot; was published, in which the visita highly praised the clergy of Venice.

In 1751, Pope Benedict XIV abolished the Patriarchate of Aquileia by creating two new archbishops in Udine and Gorizia. With this act the Patriarchate of Venice became sole heir to the throne of St. Mark in northeastern Italy.

After 1797 and the fall of the Republic of Venice under the rule of Napoleon, the bishopric rule of the doge on the Basilica and St. Mark&#x27;s relics was lacking. Then in 1807, by favor of the Viceroy of Italy, the Neapolitan Nicola Gambroni was promoted to the Patriarchate and of his own authority transferred the patriarchal seat to the Basilica of St. Mark, uniting the two chapters. He also reduced the number of parish churches from seventy to thirty. The work of enlarging the choir of the basilica brought to light the relics of St. Mark in 1808. In 1811 Napoleon intruded into the See of Venice Stefano Bonsignore, Bishop of Faenza, but in 1814 that prelate returned to his own see.

In 1819 the Diocese of Torcello and Diocese of Caorle were merged in the Patriarchate of Venice, while the dioceses of the Venetian territory were placed under its metropolitan jurisdiction. Cardinal Giuseppe Sarto, afterwards Pius X, succeeded in 1893; he was refused recognition by the Italian Government, which claimed the right of nomination formerly employed by the Habsburg Emperor of Austria and in earlier times by the Venetian Senate, but after eleven months this pretension was abandoned.

During the twentieth century three patriarchs of Venice achieved election as pope: Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, elected Pope Pius X in 1903; Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, elected Pope John XXIII in 1958; and Albino Luciani, elected Pope John Paul I in 1978.

<text>Fehmi Alpay Özalan (born 29 May 1973), known mononymously as Alpay, is a Turkish former professional footballer, football manager and politician. He last worked as the manager of Samsunspor. He played 90 international games for Turkey between 1995 and 2005, making him Turkey&#x27;s seventh-most capped player of all time. This included performances at two European Championships and the 2002 World Cup, in which he was selected for the Team of the Tournament. Since 2018, he is a member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey for the Justice and Development Party (AKP).

==Club career==
===Early career===
His senior career started at Soma Linyitspor at TFF Third League. His performances caught the eye of the biggest teams in Turkey.

In 1993, Özalan signed for Beşiktaş, one of the major Turkish clubs. Özalan set an undesirable record in the Süper Lig, earning three red cards in the space of six months. He played 148 matches for Beşiktaş, netting nine times. After six years at the club, a new deal could not be negotiated. His contract was initially bought by Siirt Jetpaspor, and he was then loaned to Fenerbahçe. In his sole season at Fenerbahçe, he played 26 matches, and found the net three times.

===Aston Villa===
After superlative performances for his country at Euro 2000, Özalan signed for English club Aston Villa. He enjoyed a good first season with Villa and became a fan favourite. His abilities caught the interest of Arsenal and Newcastle United. His partnership with Olof Mellberg as central-defensive partners was cut short as Özalan injured his ankle which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. He recovered just in time for the 2002 World Cup, in which he formed the core of an obstinate Turkish defensive unit. They finished third and he was named in the team of the tournament.

The biggest clubs in Europe took note of his performances in the Far East, including the likes of Barcelona and Internazionale. Aston Villa manager Graham Taylor refused to sell him, which was the beginning of Özalan&#x27;s downfall at Villa Park. Media reports and comments made by Taylor led to Özalan becoming a very unpopular figure at the club, missing much of the 2002–03 season. Their goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, defended Özalan in his article in the English newspaper, &quot;The Times&quot;.

Özalan returned to the Aston Villa team for the beginning of the 2003–04 season. In his first home game against Charlton Athletic, he was booed when walking on to the pitch by his own fans. However Özalan went on to score the first goal of that game. In consequence to his earlier booing, Özalan&#x27;s goal celebration served to mock the Aston Villa fans by placing his finger on his mouth. He was again dropped due to their angry reaction. The Turkish defender was then made public enemy number one in England in late 2003 after a run-in with David Beckham during the Euro 2004 qualifier in Istanbul. He first confronted the England skipper after his first-half penalty miss, glowering over him and rubbing heads with him in full view of the referee. He followed that up by prodding a finger into Beckham&#x27;s face as the players came off the pitch at half-time, sparking a tunnel brawl. Due to the angry reactions in England, his contract was terminated by Aston Villa on 23 October. Club chairman Doug Ellis declared:

===Incheon United===
Werder Bremen, Hamburger SV, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hertha Berlin and Bologna wanted to sign Özalan. However, the European transfer window was closed and he did not want to wait to play football again. He opted for a move to South Korean K-League side Incheon United&#x27;s first foray into professional football in 2004. He became a South Korean citizen while he was playing there.

===Urawa Red Diamonds===
Özalan spent less than six months with the team before moving to the J1 League with Urawa Red Diamonds. In his first season with the club, he was honoured with the best defender of the year award. The following season with the club proved to be a catastrophe. Alpay received three red cards in seven matches. The Japanese club annulled his contract due to these disciplinary problems.

===1. FC Köln===
In 2005, Özalan signed a one-year contract with the Bundesliga team 1. FC Köln. This transfer ensured his place back into the national team. They were relegated, and Manchester City, Portsmouth, Celtic, Galatasaray and Beşiktaş were interested in signing him. Özalan stayed with the club, stating that his decision was influenced by his family&#x27;s happiness in Germany.

==International career==
Özalan made 87 appearances for the Turkey national team, netting four times. Three of those goals were a hat-trick against Macedonia during the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier. He was one of the best players for his country in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where the team reached an unprecedented third place in the tournament. Özalan also featured for Turkey in Euro 1996, Euro 2000 and the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. A very memorable moment in Özalan&#x27;s career in complete contrast to his general fame was during Euro 1996 in the game between Croatia and Turkey. In a counterattack, he allowed Croatian Goran Vlaović to dribble the ball half the field without fouling him to stop the attack. In consequence, Vlaović scored the sole goal of the game and Turkey lost. Özalan was awarded with a fair-play award due to his action. On 24 June 2000, he was sent off during the first half of the Euro 2000 quarter-final against Portugal, which his country lost 2–0. His final match was against Switzerland in the 2006 FIFA World Cup second leg play-off tie in Istanbul, conceding a second-minute penalty by handball, converted by Alexander Frei which resulted in Turkey&#x27;s elimination despite a 4–2 victory. Özalan was involved in a brawl at the end of the game and was awarded a six-match ban by FIFA.

==Politician ==
In the Parliamentary elections of 24 June 2018, he was elected a member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey representing Izmir for the AKP. According to his own statement he was more excited the first day in parliament than when playing football before 85,000 people. In 2021, he was involved in a brawl in the Turkish parliament where he was seen fighting against Özgür Özel, a politician of the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP).

During the Claw lock military operation against the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), he demanded the cancellation of a concert of Aynur Dogan in Istanbul, because he deemed her a supporter of the PKK.
In August 2024, Özalan attacked and slapped Ahmet Şık, a member of parliament from the Workers&#x27; Party of Turkey, in parliament in Ankara during a debate on the imprisoned human rights lawyer Can Atalay. Şık fell, whereupon a brawl broke out involving several people.

<text>The specific weight, also known as the unit weight (symbol &quot;&quot;, the Greek letter gamma), is a volume-specific quantity defined as the weight &quot;W&quot; divided by the volume &quot;V&quot; of a material:
formula_1
Equivalently, it may also be formulated as the product of density, , and gravity acceleration, : 
formula_2
Its unit of measurement in the International System of Units (SI) is newton per cubic metre (N/m3), with base units of kgm−2s−2.
A commonly used value is the specific weight of water on Earth at , which is .

==Discussion==
The density of a material is defined as mass divided by volume, typically expressed in units of kg/m3. 
Unlike density, specific weight is not a fixed property of a material, as it depends on the value of the gravitational acceleration, which varies with location (e.g., Earth&#x27;s gravity). 
For simplicity, the standard gravity (a constant) is often assumed, usually taken as .

Pressure may also affect values, depending upon the bulk modulus of the material, but generally, at moderate pressures, has a less significant effect than the other factors.

==Applications==
===Fluid mechanics===
In fluid mechanics, specific weight represents the force exerted by gravity on a unit volume of a fluid. For this reason, units are expressed as force per unit volume (e.g., N/m3 or lbf/ft3). Specific weight can be used as a characteristic property of a fluid.

===Soil mechanics===
Specific weight is often used as a property of soil to solve earthwork problems.

In soil mechanics, specific weight may refer to:





===Civil and mechanical engineering===
Specific weight can be used in civil engineering and mechanical engineering to determine the weight of a structure designed to carry certain loads while remaining intact and remaining within limits regarding deformation.

<text>Jamie Cureton (born 28 August 1975) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is currently manager of Cambridge City.

He began his career at Norwich City in 1994, and after the club&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League at the end of the season, has spent the majority of his career in England&#x27;s lower leagues, apart from a season at South Korean side Busan I&#x27;Cons in 2003. One of the only eight English outfield footballers to have made over 1,000 competitive appearances, his career has spanned nine tiers of the football pyramid from the Premier League to the Essex Senior League, and has seen him score over 350 goals.

He has played professionally in the Football League for AFC Bournemouth, Bristol Rovers, Reading, Queens Park Rangers, Swindon Town, Colchester United, Barnsley, Shrewsbury Town, Exeter City, Leyton Orient and Cheltenham Town, as well as in non-league for Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, Farnborough, Eastleigh, St Albans City, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Hornchurch. He represented England at under-18 level.

==Playing career==
===Early years===
Born in Bristol, Cureton began his professional career with Norwich City, before moving on to Bristol Rovers. In 1993, he turned down an offer from Manchester United to stay at Carrow Road. An England youth international, he achieved significant status with the Norwich fans when he dyed his hair yellow and green for an Old Farm derby game against Ipswich Town in 1996 and subsequently scoring in the same fixture. He was sold by Mike Walker to Bristol Rovers in 1996.

===Bristol Rovers===
Cureton enjoyed a prolific spell at his hometown club. This was particularly the case during the 1999–2000 season where he struck up a partnership with Jason Roberts that almost took the club to promotion. After the club dipped out of the play-off places on the final day of the season he decided his future lay with pastures new, and headed to Reading.

===Reading===
Cureton moved to Reading in 2000, playing there for three years. While at the club, the Reading supporters&#x27; trust had a newly discovered star in the &quot;Perseus&quot; constellation named after him. Here he struck a formidable partnership with Martin Butler, becoming one of the most feared combinations in the Football League. In his first season (2000–01), he scored 30 goals, including a goal in the play-off final against Walsall, a game which Reading went on to lose 3–2. The following season however, it was Cureton who scored the goal to get Reading promoted. He scored the equaliser against Brentford in the closing stages, with a deft flick to help it over the keeper, into the corner of the net.

===Busan I&#x27;Cons===
Cureton then made a mid-2003 switch to K League side Busan I&#x27;Cons (now Busan IPark), playing under former Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield. He failed to settle in East Asia however, describing the move as &quot;another big mistake&quot; in 2014. Cureton&#x27;s time playing in South Korea is documented in the book, &quot;Who Ate All the Squid?: Football Adventures in South Korea&quot;.

===Return to England===

After being released from his contract at Busan, he returned to England and joined Queens Park Rangers on 30 January 2004. One of the more memorable of the six goals he scored there was a volley from a tight angle against Coventry City which echoed Marco Van Basten&#x27;s goal against USSR in the Euro 1988 final. After a mostly unsettled season at Loftus Road though, he joined Swindon Town in June 2005.

He failed to make his mark in his first spell at the club and subsequently joined Colchester United on loan. He then briefly returned to Swindon Town as they failed to avoid relegation to League Two. After Swindon&#x27;s relegation, Cureton activated a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave Swindon on a free transfer, and rejoined Colchester on a permanent basis. His first full season with the U&#x27;s proved to be hugely successful as the Essex club managed a 10th-place finish in the Championship, partnering Chris Iwelumo.

One of Cureton&#x27;s main highlights in a Colchester shirt was the hat-trick he scored in the 3–0 away win against Essex rivals Southend United on 7 April 2007.

His 23 goals in the 2006–07 season gave him the Championship Golden Boot as the league&#x27;s top scorer, and made him the first Colchester United striker since Tony Adcock to score 20 league goals in a season; the first for 22 years.

On 5 June 2007, due to agent demands, Cureton handed in a transfer request to Colchester United, citing Colchester&#x27;s ambitions differing from his own. This inevitably fuelled speculation that Cureton might return to Norwich City, the club where he began his career. Cureton himself stated that he would like to return to the club.

Colchester initially rejected the transfer request, saying that Cureton was an important part of the club&#x27;s future and that they wanted to keep him, though Norwich City manager Peter Grant confirmed that he would like to sign Cureton. Cureton moved to Norwich City for £825,000 on 29 June 2007. He was signed as a replacement for Robert Earnshaw, Norwich&#x27;s top scorer of the 2006–07 season, who left for Derby County in a £3.5 million deal the same day.

===Norwich City===
After his success at Colchester United, Cureton had a disappointing return to Norwich City.

He scored his first goals for Norwich since re-signing against King&#x27;s Lynn at The Walks. This was followed up by another goal on Norwich&#x27;s pre season tour of Holland against AGOVV Apeldoorn.

He then scored two in the League Cup against Barnet and two on his league debut for Norwich against Southampton.

Cureton continued to play very much a bit part during the season and one of his few goals came during the Canaries&#x27; 1–0 win at Scunthorpe United, a victory that lifted Norwich clear of the relegation places ahead of the Christmas and New Year fixtures.

Due to lack of first team football, on 27 November 2008, Cureton joined Barnsley on a 3-month loan deal, but on 14 January 2009, he was recalled to Norwich City after Glenn Roeder&#x27;s termination as manager.

When Norwich played Barnsley on the following weekend, the Canaries were 4–0 victors with Cureton scoring their second. Cureton played his 100th game for Norwich City against Coventry but put in a bad performance and was dropped for the rest of the season.

The following season, newly appointed manager Paul Lambert started Cureton for the first three games, only to drop him to the bench for the next two games, leaving him an unused sub for both.

Cureton scored his first two goals of the season, against Leyton Orient and Bristol Rovers, both in which he came on as a late sub. Cureton scored the winning penalty in a Football League Trophy match against Swindon. However this was to be his last appearance for Norwich as after this he failed to even secure a place on the bench. After being loaned out to Shrewsbury for the remainder of the season Cureton was released by Norwich City.

Cureton joined Shrewsbury Town on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season on 16 February 2010 from Norwich. After a number of starts and a number of unimpressive performances, he was sent back to Norwich prematurely.

===Exeter City and Leyton Orient===
Cureton spent the 2010 pre-season on trial with Exeter City, stating he would like to link up with a club closer to his Bristol home, and joined on a short-term deal in August 2010. A contract extension saw him continue with the Grecians until the end of 2010–11, a season in which he finished as the club&#x27;s top scorer, with 20 goals in all competition,s and won the Supporter&#x27;s Player of the Year and Player&#x27;s Player of the Year awards. A deal was offered for Cureton to stay at Exeter for 2011-12 was declined by Cureton, who instead joined Leyton Orient in June 2011. He scored his first and only goal for the O&#x27;s on 7 January 2012, in a 4–1 loss at Carlisle United, before re-joining Exeter on loan just under two months later. He scored one goal in seven appearances as the Grecians were relegated from League One. Cureton was released by Orient after the expiry of his contract in May 2012, and signed a permanent deal with Exeter in July 2012. He played 42 games in 2012–13, scoring 21 goals, but was released at the end of the season.

===Cheltenham Town===
On 17 June 2013, it was announced that Cureton had agreed terms on a one-year deal with Cheltenham Town. He ended the season with 11 goals in 36 appearances which included 12 substitute appearances. He was released by the club on 7 May 2014.

===Dagenham &amp; Redbridge===
On 24 July 2014, Cureton agreed a one-year deal with League Two side Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, the 14th club of his senior career. Following the retirements of Ryan Giggs and Kevin Phillips and Ian Goodison&#x27;s departure from Tranmere Rovers, 39-year-old Cureton was the oldest onfield player in all four of England&#x27;s top divisions. He was awarded player of the Year 2014–15 at the Daggers on the last home game of the season.

===Later career===
Cureton signed a short-term contract with Farnborough in August 2016, before moving to Eastleigh of the National League the following month. In early December, he departed Eastleigh after a change of management, and briefly re-joined Farnborough, scoring in his first game since returning to the club in a 3–2 home defeat against Hanwell Town, before joining St Albans City that same month. He returned to Farnborough in April 2017 on dual registration for the remainder of the 2016–17 season, and in July a permanent deal of one year was agreed. Having scored ten goals in 23 league appearances for Farnborough, Cureton joined Bishop&#x27;s Stortford midway through the 2017–18 season, making his début in a 3–0 defeat to Royston Town on 1 January 2018. In April 2019, Cureton reached the landmark of 1,000 senior club appearances, scoring twice as Bishop&#x27;s Stortford beat Brightlingsea Regent 3–2. In 2019 he signed dual registration terms with Enfield, who groundshare with Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. After being sent off eight minutes into his debut on 8 October, he scored in his second appearance on 24 October, becoming the first player to score in the top nine levels of English football. In February 2020, Cureton signed for Isthmian Premier League side Hornchurch. In June 2020, following a brief spell at the club in the 2019–20 season, Cureton signed for Enfield.

On 7 October 2023, Cureton, after announcing his retirement from senior football, joined fellow Isthmian League side Maldon &amp; Tiptree as a coach and was part of the coaching staff for his first game against former club Enfield. He came out of retirement as a player in March 2024, appearing as a late substitute in Maldon &amp; Tiptree&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Wroxham on 2 March.

==Coaching career==
Cureton was appointed as an assistant coach at Arsenal&#x27;s academy in September 2017.

Following the resignation of Adam Flint in September 2018, Cureton became manager of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford alongside club owner Steve Smith, as an interim to begin with. They guided Stortford to a seventh-place finish in the Isthmian Premier that season. In October 2019 he took sole charge of the position.

In September 2020, he was appointed manager while still an active player at Enfield, becoming player-manager. During the 2022–23 season, Cureton guided Enfield to the Essex Senior League title and promotion to the eighth tier.&lt;ref name=&quot;22/23 Champions&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He departed the club on 11 September 2023.

On 7 October 2023, Cureton
 joined fellow Isthmian League side Maldon &amp; Tiptree as a coach and was part of the coaching staff for his first game against former club Enfield.

On 17 May 2024, Cureton was appointed manager of Isthmian League North Division club Cambridge City.

<text>Norma Marie Talmadge (May 2, 1894 – December 24, 1957) was an American actress and film producer of the silent era. A major box-office draw for more than a decade, her career reached a peak in the early 1920s, when she ranked among the most popular idols of the American screen.

Talmadge specialized in melodrama. Her most famous film was &quot;Smilin’ Through&quot; (1922), but she also scored artistic triumphs teamed with director Frank Borzage in &quot;Secrets&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Lady&quot; (1925). Her younger sister Constance Talmadge was also a movie star. Talmadge married millionaire film producer Joseph M. Schenck and they successfully created their own production company. After reaching fame in the film studios on the East Coast, she moved to Hollywood in 1922.

Talmadge was one of the most elegant and glamorous film stars of the Roaring &#x27;20s. However, by the end of the silent era, her popularity with audiences had waned. After her two talkies proved disappointing at the box office, she retired still a very wealthy woman.

==Early life==
According to her birth certificate, Talmadge was born on May 2, 1894, in Jersey City, New Jersey. Although it has been widely reported she was born in Niagara Falls, New York, after achieving stardom, she admitted that she and her mother provided the more scenic setting of Niagara Falls to fan magazines to be more romantic. Talmadge was the eldest daughter of Frederick O. Talmadge, an unemployed chronic alcoholic, and Margaret &quot;Peg&quot; Talmadge. She had two younger sisters, Natalie and Constance, both of whom also became actresses.

The girls&#x27; childhoods were marked by poverty. One Christmas morning, Fred Talmadge left the house to buy food, and never came back, leaving his wife to raise their three daughters. Peg took in laundry, sold cosmetics, taught painting classes, and rented out rooms, raising her daughters in Brooklyn, New York.

After she told her mother about a classmate from Erasmus Hall High School who modeled for popular illustrated song slides (which were often shown before the one-reeler in movie theaters so the audience could sing along), Mrs. Talmadge decided to locate the photographer. She arranged an interview for her daughter, who after an initial rejection, was soon hired. When they went to the theater to see her debut, Peg resolved to get her into motion pictures.

==Career==
===Early films===
Norma Talmadge was the eldest of the three daughters and the first pushed by their mother to look for a career as a film actress. Mother and daughter traveled to Vitagraph Studios in Flatbush, New York, just a streetcar ride from her home. They managed to get past the studio gates and in to see the casting director, who promptly threw them out. However, scenario editor Beta Breuil, attracted by Talmadge&#x27;s beauty, arranged a small part for her as a young girl who is kissed under a photographer&#x27;s cloth in &quot;The Household Pest&quot; (1909).

Thanks to Breuil&#x27;s continued patronage, between 1911 and 1912 Talmadge played bit parts in over 100 films. She eventually earned a spot in the stock company at $25 per week and got a steady stream of work. Her first role as a contract actress was 1911&#x27;s &quot;Neighboring Kingdom&quot;, with comedian John Bunny. Her first real success came with Vitagraph&#x27;s three-reel adaptation of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1911), in which she played the small role of the unnamed seamstress who accompanies Sidney Carton to the guillotine. With help from the studio&#x27;s major star, Maurice Costello, the star of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, Talmadge&#x27;s acting improved. She continued to play roles from leads to extras, gaining experience and public exposure in a variety of characters—from a colored mammy to a clumsy waitress to a reckless young modern. She began attracting both public and critical notice. By 1913, she was Vitagraph&#x27;s most promising young actress. That same year, she was assigned to Van Dyke Brooke&#x27;s acting unit, and throughout 1913 and 1914, appeared in more films, frequently with Antonio Moreno as her leading man.

In 1915, Talmadge got her big break, starring in Vitagraph&#x27;s prestigious feature film &quot;The Battle Cry of Peace&quot;, an anti-German propagandist drama, but ambitious Peg saw that her daughter&#x27;s potential could carry them further, and got a two-year contract with National Pictures Company for eight features at $400 per week. Talmadge&#x27;s last film for Vitagraph was &quot;The Crown Prince&#x27;s Double&quot;. In the summer of 1915, she left Vitagraph. In the five years she had been with Vitagraph, she made over 250 films.

In August, the Talmadges left for California, where Norma&#x27;s first role was in &quot;Captivating Mary Carstairs&quot;. The whole enterprise was a fiasco; the sets and costumes were cheap and the studio itself lacked adequate backing. The film was a flop, and the small new studio shut down after the film&#x27;s release. The demise of National Pictures Company left the family stranded in California after only one picture. Deciding it was smarter to aim high, they went to Triangle Film Corporation, where D. W. Griffith was supervising productions. On the strength of &quot;The Battle Cry&quot;, Talmadge got a contract with Griffith&#x27;s Fine Arts Company. For eight months, she starred in seven features for Triangle, including the comedy &quot;The Social Secretary&quot; (1916), written by Anita Loos and directed by John Emerson, which gave her an opportunity to disguise her beauty as a girl trying to avoid the unwelcome attentions of her male employers.

===Norma Talmadge Film Corporation===

When the contract ran out, the Talmadges returned to New York. At a party, Talmadge met Broadway and film producer Joseph M. Schenck, a wealthy exhibitor who wanted to produce his own films. Immediately taken by Talmadge both personally and professionally, Schenck proposed marriage and a production studio. Two months later, on October 20, 1916, they were married. Talmadge called her much older husband &quot;Daddy&quot;. He supervised, controlled, and nurtured her career in alliance with her mother.

In 1917, the couple formed the Norma Talmadge Film Corporation, which became a lucrative enterprise. Schenck vowed he would make his wife the greatest star of all, one to be remembered always. The best stories, most opulent costumes, grandest sets, talented casts, and distinguished directors, along with spectacular publicity, would be hers. Before long, women around the world wanted to be the romantic Norma Talmadge and flocked to her extravagant movies filmed on the East Coast.
Talmadge&#x27;s first film for her studio, the now lost &quot;Panthea&quot; (1917), was directed by Allan Dwan with assistants Erich von Stroheim and Arthur Rosson. The film was a dramatic &quot;tour de force&quot; for her in a story set in Russia of a woman who sacrifices herself to help her husband. The film was a hit, turning Talmadge into a sensation and established her as a first-rate dramatic actress.

Talmadge&#x27;s acting ability improved rapidly during this period. She made four to six films a year in New York between 1917 and 1921. Under Schenck&#x27;s personal supervision, other films followed, including &quot;Poppy&quot; (1917), in which she was paired with Eugene O&#x27;Brien. The teaming was such a hit they made 10 more films together, including &quot;The Moth&quot; and &quot;The Secret of the Storm Country&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Tess of the Storm Country&quot; (1914), starring Mary Pickford.

===Hollywood films===

Throughout the 1920s, Talmadge continued to triumph in films such as 1920&#x27;s &quot;Yes or No&quot;, &quot;The Branded Woman&quot;, &quot;Passion Flower&quot; (1921), and &quot;The Sign on the Door&quot; (1921). The next year, she had the most popular film of her entire career, &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot; (1922) directed by Sidney Franklin. One of the greatest screen romances of the silent film era, it was remade twice, in 1932 with Norma Shearer, and in 1941 with Jeanette MacDonald.

After &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot;, Schenck closed the New York studios and Norma and Constance moved to Hollywood to join Keaton and Natalie. Talmadge&#x27;s Hollywood films were different from her New York films. Bigger and glossier, they were fewer but more varied, often with period or exotic settings. She teamed with cinematographer Tony Gaudio and some of Hollywood&#x27;s finest costume designers for a more glamorous image. She also worked with top-flight directors such as Frank Lloyd, Clarence Brown, and Frank Borzage. With help from films directed by her first husband Joseph M. Schenck, she became one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1920s.

In 1923, a poll of picture exhibitors named Norma Talmadge the number-one box office star. She was earning $10,000 a week, and receiving as many as 3,000 letters weekly from her fans. Her film &quot;Secrets&quot; (1924), directed by Frank Borzage, marked the pinnacle of her career, with her giving her best performance and receiving the best reviews. In 1924, Schenck had moved over to head United Artists, but Talmadge still had a distribution contract with First National. She continued to make successful films such as &quot;The Lady&quot; (1925) directed by Frank Borzage and the romantic comedy &quot;Kiki&quot; (1926) directed by Clarence Brown, remade later by Mary Pickford as a sound film in 1931.

Talmadge and Anna May Wong turned the first spadeful of earth using a gold-plated shovel at the groundbreaking ceremonies for Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on January 5, 1926. The theater&#x27;s official account also credits Talmadge as having inspired the theater’s tradition of putting footprints in concrete when she accidentally stepped into wet concrete. However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; broadcast of a radio adaptation of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, Sid Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was &quot;pure accident. I walked right into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was. So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it.&quot;

===Decline===

Talmadge&#x27;s last film for First National was &quot;Camille&quot; (1926), an adaptation of a novel by Alexandre Dumas the younger later remade by Greta Garbo. During filming, Talmadge fell in love with leading man Gilbert Roland.

She asked Schenck for a divorce, but he was not ready to grant it. Despite his personal feelings, he was not going to break up a moneymaking team and continued casting Roland in Talmadge&#x27;s next three films released by United Artists. Talmadge and Schenck separated, though he continued producing her films. He was now president of the prestigious but theater-poor United Artists Corporation, and the rest of Talmadge&#x27;s films were released for that company. UA&#x27;s distribution problems, however, began to erode her popularity. Her first films for this studio, &quot;The Dove&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Woman Disputed&quot; (1928), were box-office failures and ended up being her last silent movies.

By the time &quot;Woman Disputed&quot; (1928) was released, the talking film revolution had begun, and Talmadge began taking voice lessons in preparation. She worked diligently with voice coaches for over a year so she could make her sound debut. Her first talkie, &quot;New York Nights&quot; (1929), showed that she could speak and act acceptably in talkies. While her performance was considered to be good, the film was not. Talmadge next took on the role of Madame du Barry in the 1930 film &quot;Du Barry, Woman of Passion&quot;. With incompetent direction and Talmadge&#x27;s inexperience at a role requiring very demanding vocal acting, the film was a failure, in spite of the elaborate sets by William Cameron Menzies.

On March 29, 1928, at the bungalow of Mary Pickford, United Artists brought together Talmadge, Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, Dolores del Río, and D.W. Griffith to speak on the radio show &quot;The Dodge Brothers Hour&quot; to prove that Griffith could meet the challenge of talking movies.

Talmadge&#x27;s sister Constance sent her a telegram with this advice: &quot;Quit pressing your luck, baby. The critics can&#x27;t knock those trust funds Mama set up for us&quot;. As time passed, it became increasingly clear that the public was no longer interested in its old favorites, and Talmadge was seen as an icon of the past. Talmadge had been increasingly bored with filmmaking before the talkie challenge came along, and this setback seems to have discouraged her from further attempts.

She still had two more films left on her United Artists contract. In late 1930, Samuel Goldwyn announced he had bought the film rights to Zoë Akins&#x27; comedy play &quot;The Greeks Had a Word for It&quot; for her. She reportedly did some stage rehearsals for it in New York, but within a few months, she asked to be released from her contract. She never again appeared on screen. (Goldwyn eventually made the film version of &quot;The Greeks Had a Word for It&quot; under the title &quot;The Greeks Had a Word for Them&quot; in 1932.)

==Retirement==
Upon leaving the movie world, Norma Talmadge rid herself of all the duties and responsibilities of stardom. She told eager fans who were pressing her for an autograph as she left a restaurant, &quot;Get away, dears. I don&#x27;t need you anymore and you don&#x27;t need me.&quot;

Some time before late 1932, Talmadge decided against marrying Gilbert Roland, as he was 11 years her junior and she feared he would eventually leave her. Mother Peg fell ill, and died in September 1925. In late 1932, Talmadge began seeing her ex-husband Joseph Schenck&#x27;s poker friend, comedian George Jessel. In April 1934, Schenck, from whom she had been separated for seven years, finally granted Talmadge her divorce, and nine days later, she married Jessel. Schenck continued to do what he could for Norma and her sisters, acting as a financial adviser and guiding her business affairs.

In 1937, Talmadge and Schenck bought the Villa Riviera in Long Beach, California for $1.5 million.

Talmadge&#x27;s last professional works consisted of appearances on Jessel&#x27;s radio program, which was sagging in the ratings. The program soon ended, and the marriage did not last; the couple divorced in 1939. Schenck&#x27;s business acumen and her mother&#x27;s watchful ambition for her daughters had resulted in a huge fortune for Talmadge, and she never wanted for money. Restless since the end of her filmmaking days, Talmadge traveled, often shuttling between her houses, entertaining, and visiting with her sisters. In 1946, she married Dr. Carvel James, a Beverly Hills physician.

==Later years and death==
In her later years, Talmadge, who had never been comfortable with the burdens of public celebrity, became reclusive. Increasingly crippled by painful arthritis and reported to be dependent on painkilling drugs, she moved to the warm climate of Las Vegas for her final years. According to Anita Loos&#x27; memories of Talmadge, the drug addiction came first which caused arthritis and was the basis of Norma&#x27;s interest in her physician husband. 

After suffering a series of strokes in 1957, Talmadge died of pneumonia on Christmas Eve of that year. At the time of her death, her estate was valued at more than US$1,000,000 (equivalent to $ million in ).

Talmadge Street in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles is named in honor of the silent screen star. Also, the community of Talmadge, San Diego is named for her and her sisters, and one of the community&#x27;s streets is named Norma in her honor.

==In popular culture==

A &quot;New York Times&quot; article from March 14, 2010, says that Talmadgeis misremembered, having inspired two unfair caricatures that have lived on in a pair of popular films. In &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), she is parodied as Lina Lamont ... More malignantly, Billy Wilder used Norma Talmadge as the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen of his 1950 film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. Lina Lamont bears little resemblance to Talmadge&#x27;s personality either on or off the screen, and, unlike the delusional Desmond, Talmadge was not stuck in the past and had left her stardom behind her with considerable relief.

Talmadge is referenced by name in Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999), in which the Hattie character, played by Samantha Morton, is cast in a silent film as her younger sister, and described by one character as, &quot;...a dead ringer for May Talmadge.&quot;

In the 1960 film adaptation of William Inge&#x27;s &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot;, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston&#x27;s character Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they would like to see them, his uncle asks, &quot;Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?&quot; Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, &quot;Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That&#x27;s all I hear, is &#x27;Norma Talmadge&#x27;! Maybe you&#x27;d like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope tell you what to do with the rest of your life.&quot; She &quot;gets even&quot; with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I&#x27;d be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me.&quot;

<text>My Dark Places: An L.A. Crime Memoir is a 1996 book, part investigative journalism and part memoir, by American crime-fiction writer James Ellroy. Ellroy&#x27;s mother Geneva was murdered in 1958, when he was 10 years old, and the killer was never identified. The book is Ellroy&#x27;s account of his attempt to solve the mystery by hiring a retired Los Angeles County homicide detective to investigate the crime. Ellroy also explores how being directly affected by a crime shaped his life - often for the worse - and led him to write crime novels. The book is dedicated to his mother.

== Summary ==
James Ellroy&#x27;s mother, Geneva &quot;Jean&quot; Ellroy, was found strangled by a roadside in El Monte, California, on June 22, 1958. Officers from the El Monte police department handed over the investigation to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau. They chased down leads gathered from the scene and from anonymous tips sent in by residents. Newspaper accounts about the murder were scarce, as well as the television news accounts. Three other murders had occurred in El Monte in 1958 by that time, and all had been resolved quickly. After all the leads went dry, the Ellroy case was eventually abandoned and never solved.

Geneva&#x27;s murder later contributed to James&#x27; fascination with another unsolved murder in Los Angeles: the January 1947 killing of Elizabeth Short. This murder, later called the &quot;Black Dahlia case&quot;, bore some similarities to Jean Ellroy&#x27;s murder. Both victims had been dumped by the roadside to be found by passersby. In his book, Ellroy describes the discovery of his mother’s body as a &quot;classic late night body dump.&quot; Jean’s murder remained obscure because it lacked the grotesque details and media attention of the Dahlia murder.

In &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, Ellroy created a fictional story around the murder of Short. In &quot;My Dark Places&quot;, Ellroy writes a true crime memoir. Retired L.A. investigator Bill Stoner assisted Ellroy in his search for the killer. Ellroy had never seen the police file of his mother’s murder until he decided to write this book in the mid-1990s. After fifteen months of investigation, the crime remained unsolved, and any potential suspects are believed to be dead.

==Continuing investigation==
After the final page of the memoir, there is a page that allows information to be sent pertaining to the investigation. It states: &quot;The investigation continues. Information on the case can be forwarded to Detective Stoner either through the toll-free number, 1-800-717-6517, or his e-mail address, detstoner@earthlink.net.&quot;

==Critical reviews==
The reviews for &quot;My Dark Places&quot; were quite positive. &quot;Both a harrowing autobiography and a disturbingly fixed love story...blunt, graphic, and oddly exhilarating.&quot; —&quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. &quot;Strange and perversely fascinating...[&quot;My Dark Places&quot;] is part thriller, part screech of pain, part botched exorcism... It is also a profoundly pessimistic meditation on the ubiquity of evil... A candid chronicle of growing up weird under the sentence of unexpressed grief.&quot; —&quot;Newsday&quot;. &quot;A dazzling memoir that reads half like a romance, half like the logbook for a homicide investigation... &quot;My Dark Places&quot; is remarkable.&quot; —A. M. Homes, &quot;Bazaar&quot;. &quot;A masterpiece... Incredible, fascinating detail... Ellroy is never anything but honest: All the scars are exposed... and best of all, it is all written in that familiar Ellroy style, each sentence like a finger jabbed in your chest... This is a mesmerizing book.&quot; —&quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Ellroy&#x27;s &quot;My Dark Places&quot; was a &quot;Time&quot; Best Book of the Year, as well as a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book for 1996.

<text>Baillaud is a lunar impact crater that is located near the north limb of the Moon. The rim of the crater has been eroded and worn by a long history of impacts, leaving a hilly ridge surrounding the interior. The crater Euctemon is intruding into the rim to the northeast, and the rim bulges outward to the northwest. At the south end of the crater is a gap connecting to the lava-flooded surface to the south.

The interior of Baillaud has been submerged by past lava flows, leaving a flat surface that is marked only by many craterlets and the satellite crater Baillaud E in the western half. The crater interior lacks a central peak or significant ridges.

Nearby craters include the irregular Meton formation to the southwest, and Petermann further to the east. Due to its location, Baillaud appears oblong because of foreshortening along the line of sight to Earth.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Baillaud.

<text>Thomas Fritz Goreau (August 16, 1924 in Germany - April 22, 1970 in New York) was a marine biologist who worked extensively on the coral reefs of Jamaica, and many other reefs in the Pacific, Caribbean, and Red Sea. He is the son of renowned science photographer Fritz Goro.

==Career==

Goreau moved from Germany to Austria at the age of 8, and lived in France and the United States, where he studied at Clark University, The University of Pennsylvania Medical School, and received his Ph.D in ecology from Yale University. In 1951 he went to lecture at the medical school at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, and in 1956 he founded a long-term research project exploring the coral reefs of Jamaica.

==Death==

His work on coral reefs began in 1947, when, as a student, he became involved with the Bikini Atoll atom bomb test site in the Marshall Islands as a chemist. As the diver who collected radioactive specimens from the lagoons, he most likely received lethal radiation exposure. Consequently, he died from cancer at the age of 45.

==Legacy==

He built rebreather diving gear to explore the deep sea, and was the first diving marine scientist. He founded the marine laboratory at Discovery Bay, Jamaica in an abandoned urinal on a fisherman&#x27;s beach in the early 1960s. The fame of his research, which pioneered most of the techniques used in modern coral reef science, led to the construction of a research lab that opened only after his death in 1970.

He pioneered the use of scuba gear as a marine research tool, the use of radioisotopes to understand the growth of corals and marine organisms, the zonation of coral reefs, and many aspects of coral reef ecology and geology. With Nora I. Goreau he did the basic work on the biology and physiology of corals and the role of algal symbiosis in their growth. They discovered many new species, and explored many other subjects. Their work showed how coral reefs function and established their great sensitivity to environmental stress. His widow Nora I. Goreau, the first Panamanian marine biologist, and son Thomas J. Goreau continue to focus their research on coral reefs.

<doc id="1060945" wikidata="Q209691" url="?curid=1060945" title="AVG AntiVirus">
<text>AVG AntiVirus (previously known as AVG, an abbreviation of Anti-Virus Guard) is a line of antivirus software developed by AVG Technologies, a subsidiary of Avast, a part of Gen Digital. It is available for Windows, macOS and Android.

== History ==

The brand AVG comes from Grisoft&#x27;s first product, Anti-Virus Guard, launched in 1992 in the Czech Republic. In 1997, the first AVG licenses were sold in Germany and the UK. AVG was introduced in the US in 1998.

The AVG Free Edition helped raise awareness of the AVG product line. In 2006, the AVG security package grew to include anti-spyware as AVG Technologies acquired ewido Networks, an anti-spyware group. AVG Technologies acquired Exploit Prevention Labs (XPL) in December 2007 and incorporated that company&#x27;s LinkScanner safe search and surf technology into the AVG 8.0 security product range released in March 2008. In January 2009, AVG Technologies acquired Sana Security, a developer of identity theft prevention software. This software was incorporated into the AVG security product range in March 2009.

According to AVG Technologies, the company has more than 200 million active users worldwide, including more than 100 million who use their products and services on mobile devices.

On 7 July 2016, Avast announced an agreement to acquire AVG for $1.3 billion.

== Platform support ==

AVG provides AVG AntiVirus Free for Windows, AVG AntiVirus for Mac for macOS and AVG AntiVirus for Android for Android devices. All are freemium products: They are free to download, install, update and use, but for technical support a premium plan must be purchased.

AVG stopped providing new features for Windows XP and Windows Vista in January 2019. New versions require Windows 7 or later; virus definitions are still provided for previous versions.

== Features ==
AVG features most of the common functions available in modern antivirus and Internet security programs, including periodic scans, scans of sent and received emails (including adding footers to the emails indicating this), the ability to repair some virus-infected files, and a quarantine area (virus vault) in which infected files are held.

=== LinkScanner ===
The LinkScanner technology acquired from Exploit Prevention Labs and built into most AVG products, provides real-time updated protection against exploits and drive-by downloads. LinkScanner includes: Search-Shield – a safe search component that places safety ratings next to each link in Google, Yahoo! and MSN search results; plus Active Surf-Shield – a safe surf component that scans the contents of a web site in real-time to ensure it&#x27;s safe being opened. Concerns regarding web analytics have made LinkScanner a controversial component (see &quot;LinkScanner concerns&quot; below).

==== LinkScanner concerns ====
When AVG 8.0 was first released, its LinkScanner safe search feature was shown to cause an increase in traffic on websites that appear high in search engine results pages. Since LinkScanner disguises the scans as coming from an Internet Explorer 6 browser when it prescans each site listed in the search results, website usage logs showed incorrect and overinflated site visitor statistics. The prescanning of every link in search results also caused websites to transfer more data than usual, resulting in higher bandwidth usage for web site operators and slow performance for users. AVG initially said that site administrators would be able to filter the LinkScanner traffic out of their site statistics, leaving the problem of excess bandwidth usage still to be solved. Pay-per-click advertising was not affected by the increase in traffic.

=== AVG Online Shield ===
AVG Online Shield is a feature designed to check files and ensure that they are safe. AVG Online Shield also ensures the safety of exchanging files via instant messengers and VoIP clients.

In response to complaints, AVG announced that as of 9 July 2008 &quot;Search-Shield will no longer scan each search result online for new exploits, which was causing the spikes that webmasters addressed with us&quot;, releasing a new build on that date that applies a local blacklist, then prefetches and scans only those links clicked on by the user.

== Controversy ==
As of 2014, there are numerous reports dating back to 2012 that the AVG SafeGuard Toolbar installs itself without the consent of the user, as a side effect of installing other applications. The toolbar program appears to cause significant RAM issues and can be considered an intrusive potentially unwanted program (PUP). Once installed, the AVG toolbar is virtually impossible to remove. The toolbar uninstaller does not function, instead re-installing the add-on if manually removed. Consequently, many discussions and blog posts have described complex procedures for removal of the AVG toolbar, each with very mixed results.

In September 2015, AVG announced that it would start tracking users for profit, analyzing their data for sale to the advertising industry. This measure received criticism from consumers, the press and security industry, as many users intended to use the software in order to protect themselves from spyware and would not expect the functions of spyware to be &quot;hidden&quot; in security software.

In December 2015, the AVG Web TuneUp Google Chrome extension (automatically installed with AVG AntiVirus) was revealed to contain multiple critical security vulnerabilities. Most notably, Chrome users&#x27; browsing history could be exposed to any website, cookies from any site the user has visited could be read by an attacker, and trivial cross-site scripting (XSS) issues could allow any website to execute arbitrary code (as another domain).

The XSS vulnerability allowed a user&#x27;s mail from &quot;mail.google.com&quot; to be read by any website, or financial information to be read from the user&#x27;s online banking site. The AVG team fixed this by only allowing &quot;mysearch.avg.com&quot; and &quot;webtuneup.avg.com&quot; to execute these scripts. Despite this remediation, attackers could leverage any of these attacks if an XSS vulnerability was found on the AVG sites. As of April 2016, Web TuneUp was still not available for download from the AVG website.

<text>The history of Russian animation is the visual art form produced by Russian animation makers. As most of Russia&#x27;s production of animation for cinema and television were created during Soviet times, it may also be referred to some extent as the history of Soviet animation. It remains a nearly unexplored field in film theory and history outside Russia.

== Beginnings ==

The first Russian animator was Alexander Shiryaev, a principal ballet dancer and choreographer at the Mariinsky Theatre who made a number of pioneering stop motion and traditionally animated films between 1906 and 1909. He built an improvised studio at his apartment where he carefully recreated various ballets — first by making thousands of sketches and then by staging them using hand-made puppets; he shot them using the 17.5 mm Biokam camera, frame by frame. Shiryaev didn&#x27;t hold much interest in animation as an art form, but rather saw it as an instrument in studying human plastics. They were mostly forgotten during the Soviet period, mentioned only in the memoirs of his students. In 1995, they were re-discovered by a ballet historian Viktor Bocharov who got hold of Shiryayev&#x27;s archives and released &quot;A Belated Premiere&quot; documentary in 2003 with fragments of various films. All of them were later restored and digitized with the help from the Pordenone Silent Film Festival and Aardman Animations.

The second person to independently discover animation was Vladislav Starevich. Being a trained biologist, he started to make animation with embalmed insects for educational purposes, but soon realized the possibilities of this medium to become one of the undisputed masters of stop motion later in his life. His first few films, made in 1910, were dark comedies on the family lives of cockroaches, and were so revolutionary that they earned him a decoration from Nicholas II of Russia. He produced a number of other popular animated films with insects at the Aleksandr Khanzhonkov&#x27;s studio where he also worked as a cinematographer and a director of live-action films, sometimes combining live action with stop motion animation, as in &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;A Terrible Vengeance&quot; (both from 1913). Starevich left Russia after the October Revolution, and for many years, the animation industry was paralyzed.

== After the revolution ==

In the early years after the October Revolution, Russian animation remained undeveloped compared to cinema or theatre. The 1923 agitprop animated short &quot;Today&quot; directed by Dziga Vertov and animated by Ivan Belyaev became a pioneering work and was followed by other cutout films (called flat marionettes at the time) in style of editorial cartoons that satirized bourgeoisie, Church and Western countries, drawn and animated in a sketchy manner; those included films and sketches by Vetrov and Aleksandr Bushkin for Sovkino such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Humoresques&quot; and episodes of &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot;.

In 1924, Mezhrabpom-Rus released the critically acclaimed &quot;&quot; that satirized &quot;Aelita&quot;. It also utilized cutout animation along with the constructivism art style and was developed independently by three artists — Nikolai Khodataev, Zenon Komissarenko and Yuri Merkulov — who headed the first Soviet animation studio at the All-Union Technicum of Cinematography. In 1925, it was followed by a government-backed &quot;China in Flames&quot; made by the same team along with Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Vladimir Suteev and the Brumberg sisters. With 1000 meters of film and 14 frames per second it ran over 50 minutes at the time, which made it the first Soviet animated feature film and one of the first in the world.

During the late 1920s, the industry started moving away from agitation. In 1927, Merkulov, Ivanov-Vano and directed the first Soviet cartoon aimed at children — &#x27; based on the fairy tale in verse by Korney Chukovsky. Made at Mezhrabpom-Rus, it combined traditional animation and some live action scenes. Same year Ivanov-Vano and Cherkes worked on &#x27;, another hand-drawn short that featured a distinguishable art style (white lines against black background). It was written and directed by Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky and Nikolai Bartram, founder of the Moscow Toy Museum, who also produced &quot;Bolvashka&#x27;s Adventures&quot; that combined live action and stop motion animation in a story about a Pinocchio-like wooden boy. The idea was extended in a spiritual successor — &quot;Bratishkin&#x27;s Adventures&quot;, the first Soviet animated series created between 1928 and 1931 by Yuri Merkulov and Aleksandr Ptushko at Mosfilm.
In 1928, Nikolai Khodataev, his sister Olga Khodataeva and the Brumberg sisters produced a hand-drawn animated short &quot;&quot; stylized as traditional Nenets art that followed a dramatic narrative and used an innovative technique of printing on thin celluloid. A 24-minute stop motion film &quot;The Adventures of the Little Chinese&quot; was directed same year by and could be considered a return to the traditions of Ladislas Starevich.

Mikhail Tsekhanovsky&#x27;s &quot;Post&quot; (1929, cutout/cel animation) was both a return to constructivism traditions and a big step forward: it was successfully exported and widely shown around the world, while in the USSR it changed the perception of animation as an art form. It also became the first colorized Soviet animated film and one of the first to get a musical score and a voiceover by Daniil Kharms. Mikhail and his wife Vera Tsekhanovskaya led an animation studio at Lenfilm where a number of distinctive hand-drawn and stop motion films were created throughout the 1930s, including the much-praised &quot;&quot; (1938) by . The team actively applied color using the original dye-transfer process invented by Lenfilm specialists, similar to Technicolor.
In 1933, the couple collaborated with Dmitri Shostakovich and Alexander Vvedensky on the first traditionally animated Soviet feature — &quot;The Tale of the Priest and of His Workman Balda&quot;, a satirical opera loosely based on the fairy tale in verse by Alexander Pushkin and stylized as ROSTA posters. Despite many problems, including the infamous bullying of Shostakovich in press, the film was nearly finished and had been stored at Lenfilm until 1941 when almost all of it was destroyed in fire caused by the bombings of Leningrad. Tsekhanovsky is also credited with invention of graphical sound along with Arseny Avraamov and . They were challenged by a group led by who made a number of animated shorts based on their own idea of &quot;drawing paper sound&quot;.

In 1935, Aleksandr Ptushko directed &quot;The New Gulliver&quot;, one of the world&#x27;s first full-length animated movies that combined detailed stop motion with a live actor (a 15-year-old boy). The film featured from 1,500 to 3,000 different puppets with detachable heads and various facial expressions, as well as camera and technical tricks.
The international success of the movie allowed Ptushko to open his own &quot;division of 3D animation&quot; at Mosfilm which also worked as a school for beginning animators. In four years, they created a dozen of stop motion shorts; most of them, such as (1936), were based around Russian folklore, traditional art (with the involvement of artists from Palekh) and could be watched in full color thanks to the newly invented three-color film process by . In 1939, Ptushko directed another feature — &quot;The Golden Key&quot; based on the popular Soviet fairy tale; it also combined stop motion with live action, but to a lesser extent.

Simultaneously, Alexandre Alexeieff who fled for France during the Russian Civil War developed a pinscreen animation technology along with his wife, Claire Parker that allowed for a wide spectre of special effects achieved through the use of hundreds of thousands of pins that formed different patterns. Despite the status of white émigré in the USSR his films were well known among Russian professionals and inspired various artists, most famously Yuri Norstein. In the mid-1990s Alexeieff&#x27;s daughter visited Moscow and presented her father&#x27;s works to the . Today he is commemorated as a patriarch of Russian animation.

== Soyuzmultfilm, 1936–1960 ==

In September 1933, the Principal Management of the Photo-Cinematographic Industry (GUKF) ordered to provide animators with facilities and equipment; meanwhile, specialized script-writers were hired for Animated feature films. who headed the Amkino Corporation, a New York-based company responsible for distribution of Soviet movies in North America, was given the task to study the animation processes at Disney and Fleischer Studios. Next year Smirnov returned to Moscow and founded an Experimental Animation Workshop under the Main Directorate of the Photo-Cinematographic Industry where he, Alexei Radakov, Vladimir Suteev and started &quot;developing the Disney style&quot;. In 1935, Walt Disney himself sent a film reel with Three Little Pigs and Mickey Mouse shorts to the Moscow International Film Festival that made a lasting impression on Soviet animators and officials.
On June 10, 1936, the Soyuzdetmultfilm Studio was created in Moscow from the small and relatively independent trickfilm units of Mosfilm, Sovkino, Mezhrabpomfilm and Smirnov&#x27;s studio. In a year it was renamed to Soyuzmultfilm. Three-months retraining courses were organized by the studio administration where animators studied everything, from drawing and directing movies to the basics of music and acting. For four years some of the leading animators focused on the creation of Disney-style shorts, exclusively using the cel technique. From 1937, on they also produced films in full color using the three-color film process by Pavel Mershin.
In 1938, the team also mastered rotoscoping, or Eclair as it has been known in Russia since the 1920s (after the Eclair video projector). Not everyone was happy with the chosen direction though, and by 1939 many developed their own styles. Ivan Ivanov-Vano directed based on the fairy tale in verse which he personally praised as an important step from Disney. Suteev and Lamis Bredis presented a distinctive Uncle Styopa adaptation, while Leonid Amalrik and converted Doctor Aybolit stories into a distinctive mini-series that ran from 1939 to 1946 and defined the &quot;Soviet style&quot; of animation. At the same time Aleksandr Ivanov and made a radical shift towards agitprop and socialist realism with films such as &quot;Grandfather Ivan&quot; and &quot;War Chronicles&quot;.

Soon after Lev Kuleshov, then a professor at VGIK, suggested Ivanov-Vano to open and head a workshop under the Art Faculty which became the first official Russian workshop where students studied the art of animation. Among Ivanov&#x27;s first students were Lev Milchin, Yevgeniy Migunov and .
With the start of the Great Patriotic War the studio was evacuated to Samarkand along with some key animators who continued teaching students and producing films, including anti-fascist propaganda. In 1943, they returned to Moscow and released several kids movies such as &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot; (1943) by the Brumberg sisters and (1945) by Ivanov-Vano — the last film to use the Soviet three-color filming process before the switch to Agfacolor. By that time Ptushko&#x27;s studio at Mosfilm had been shut down and Tsekhanovsky&#x27;s studio at Lenfilm — destroyed by a bomb, which basically turned Soyuzmultfilm into Russia&#x27;s animation monopolist.

Yet even after the war, its resources were very limited. 19 animators from the relatively small Soyuzmultfilm team were killed in action. A whole generation of Leningrad animators either disappeared at fronts or died during the Siege of Leningrad. Others returned as war-disabled, like Boris Dyozhkin and Aleksandr Vinokurov (both lost their left eyes), who got a bullet stuck in his head and who lost his right arm and learned to work as left-handed. One of the leading directors, Vladimir Suteev, left the industry on his return for personal reasons.
The rest worked intensively to prepare new animators; between 1945 and 1948, four groups of students graduated from VGIK. They also continued releasing short and feature films that brought them international recognition, such as &quot;The Lost Letter&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Humpbacked Horse&quot; (1947) that was used by Walt Disney as a teaching tool for his artists. In 1948, short comedy film was accused of &quot;formalism&quot; and &quot;anthropomorphism&quot; following the Cold War anti-Disney campaign. As the art director Yevgeniy Migunov remembered, he floutingly drew backgrounds for his next movie as realistic as possible, and suddenly it became &quot;a golden standard&quot; for the next ten years. Ironically, he would become one of the leading innovators later on.

From 1950 to 1960, the vast majority of animated films were fairy tale adaptations influenced by the works of Viktor Vasnetsov, Ivan Bilibin, Mikhail Vrubel, Palekh and Fedoskino miniatures and other national styles. The Disney&#x27;s conveyor method of production with a clear work split was implemented along with a full analog of a multiplane camera. Eclair (rotoscoping) also rose to popularity. According to the 1951 report by Ivan Ivanov-Vano, it was a temporary measure that served as a teaching tool for beginning animators. Many leading actors were involved, such as Mikhail Astangov who appeared as the beast in &quot;The Scarlet Flower&quot; (1952).

Some directors made extensive use of this method, while others mixed it with traditional animation as in &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (1957) by Lev Atamanov, arguably the most famous work of that time. Many focused on animal art with little to no use of rotoscoping. All this allowed for a yearly release of prominent feature films with high production values such as &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; (1951), &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; (1952), &quot;The Enchanted Boy&quot; and &quot;The Frog Princess&quot; (1954), &quot;The Twelve Months&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Adventures of Buratino&quot; (1959).

== The Khrushchev Thaw ==
First changes happened in 1953 when a puppet division was reopened at Soyuzmultfilm. In 1954, Yevgeniy Migunov along with an engineer Semyon Etlis produced the first Soviet stop motion film since Aleksandr Ptushko: &quot;&quot; about the adventures of the Russian clown Karandash and his dog. According to Migunov, they had to reinvent the whole production process. They organized a technical base, constructed and patented a device for shooting in statics, with a horizontally moving camera and attachable dolls. Also for the first time they used ball-jointed dolls and latex to make puppet faces.

They were followed by Vladimir Degtyaryov who produced many films such as &quot;Beloved Beauty&quot; (1958) and &#x27; (1962), Roman Kachanov and who directed the award-winning &#x27; (1959) that combined stop motion, traditional and cutout animation, and Nikolay Serebryakov whose style was marked by extensive aesthetic search for &quot;combination of realism and the baroque&quot;. Sergey Obraztsov and his team also produced a number of movies using hand puppets.
In 1957, Migunov directed &#x27; based on the sketches by a stand-up comedian Arkady Raikin who also appeared in the short. What made it special was a radical style of magazine caricatures, since Raikin&#x27;s satire didn&#x27;t fit the &quot;realistic&quot; art direction. It was not long until other animators started abandoning it. In 1958, Alexandra Snezhko-Blotskaya released an adaptation of Arkady Gaidar&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Malchish-Kibalchish&quot; inspired by ROSTA posters, while Boris Stepantsev and Evgeny Raykovsky directed a postmodern &#x27; that leant towards Tex Avery.

In 1960–1962, a whole line of &quot;formalistic&quot; features hit the screens, such as &quot;It Was I Who Drew the Little Man&quot; by the Brumberg sisters, &quot;The Key&quot; by Lev Atamanov, &quot;Cipollino&quot; by Boris Dyozhkin and &quot;The Wild Swans&quot; by Mikhail and Vera Tsekhanovsky — the first Soviet widescreen feature that introduced Gothic art style. Ivanov-Vano also broke new grounds with &quot;The Flying Proletary&quot; (1962), the first widescreen stop motion short based on the poems and art of Vladimir Mayakovsky that made use of bas-relief paper dolls. Same year Fyodor Khitruk made a directoral debut with a primitivistic cutout short &quot;The Story of a Crime&quot; that told a contemporary story and gained international praise.

== Soyuzmultfilm, 1964–1991 ==
In the following years, many animators turned away from the conveyor method of production and developed their own distinctive styles and approaches. The number of titles rose through the mid-1960 into the 1970s and 1980s, up to fifty per year. Mini-series and anthologies became common, while the amount of feature films decreased dramatically.

Director Boris Stepantsev was known for experimenting a lot. Among his films was another postmodern comedy &quot;Vovka in the Far Far Away Kingdom&quot; (1965), the paint-on-glass animation &quot;Song of a Falcon&quot; (1967), the highly popular &quot;Karlsson-on-the-Roof&quot; dilogy (1968–1970) that made use of xerography and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; adaptation (1973) that presented a familiar story without a single spoken word.

Some patriarchs also joined the new wave. Ivanov-Vano was appointed an artistic director of the puppet division where he made a number of stop motion/cutout films inspired by Russian folk art, like &quot;Lefty&quot; (1964) that addressed lubok, &quot;Go There, Don&#x27;t Know Where&quot; (1966) that used elements of rayok and skomorokh theatre, &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1969) based around Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;two character pieces&quot;, presented as a combination of Dymkovo toys and lace, and the award-winning &quot;The Battle of Kerzhenets&quot; (1971) where frescos and icons came to life.

Another well-respected old-timer Boris Dyozhkin launched a popular series of short comedy films about two teams that competed in various sport disciplines such as football, hockey, skiing, boxing and so on. It ran from 1963 to 1981 and was notable for fast-paced slapstick synchronized with music.

Among the most political animators were Fyodor Khitruk whose satire &quot;The Man in the Frame&quot; (1966) was cut by censors and Andrei Khrzhanovsky whose surrealist film &quot;The Glass Harmonica&quot; (1968) was shelved for many years. On the other hand, Khitruk&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1965), &quot;Film, Film, Film&quot; (1968) and the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; trilogy in particular became an instant success among both kids and adults.

Roman Kachanov made numerous films for children. He started with puppet animation such as &quot;A Little Frog is Looking for his Father&quot;, &quot;The Mitten&quot; and, most famously, the &quot;Cheburashka&quot; series that turned Cheburashka into one of the iconic characters of Soyuzmultfilm. In his late years he switched to traditional animation with the feature science fiction film &quot;The Mystery of the Third Planet&quot; (1981).
&quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot; mini-series by Roman Davydov was released from 1967 to 1971. Just like &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, it was not conceived as a reaction to the Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (even the first episode was developed simultaneously) and followed the original plot closely, appearing more adult and spiritually closer to the book. In 1973, the shorts were combined into a 96-minute feature.

The rising popularity of the industry started drawing people from other areas. Vasily Livanov, originally an actor, finished animation courses and directed several experimental pictures. Yet his biggest success was &quot;The Bremen Town Musicians&quot; (1969), an animated musical film heavily influenced by rock and roll and hippie cultures. The first part was directed by Inessa Kovalevskaya who also abandoned her position at Goskino to work on animated musicals. After she left the project, Livanov directed the sequel by himself. The three main characters were voiced by the leading Soviet pop singer Muslim Magomayev.
1969 saw the birth of Russia&#x27;s most popular animation series &quot;Well, Just You Wait!&quot; directed by Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin. These seemingly simple miniatures about a wolf chasing a hare through Soviet-style cartoon worlds owe a great deal of their popularity to the quality animation, varied soundtrack and cunning subtexts built into their parts. The original series ran from 1969 to 1993. During the mid-2000s, an unsuccessful attempt to reboot the series was made. Another attempt would be made in 2020, releasing in 2021 after delays, though to mass negative reviews. The series uses 3D instead of the traditional 2D animation that was associated with the beloved series. The new version of the cartoon was also modernized for younger audiences, no doubt alienating its previous fans who grew up watching the antics of the wolf and hare.

Also, in 1969, a long-running animated anthology series &quot;Happy Merry-Go-Round&quot; was founded by Anatoly Petrov and Galina Barinova. Each episode combined several short experimental films by the beginning directors like Leonid Nosyrev, , Eduard Nazarov, Gennady Sokolsky, Garri Bardin and .

Most of them gained acclaim later on, working in their own unique niches. Anatoly Petrov showed extreme realism (close to photorealism) without rotoscopy, photography or any &quot;cheating&quot;. His style was known as &quot;photographics&quot;, or &quot;graphical painting&quot;; for many years he developed the so-called effect of moving glaze in a 3D environment using traditional animation materials. The final result was close to advanced CGI long before it was invented. Among his best works was &quot;Polygon&quot; (1977) and several films based on Greek mythology.

Gennady Sokolsky focused on environmental films with attractive characters and ambient soundtracks: &#x27; (1977), &#x27; (1978) and &quot;The Adventures of Lolo the Penguin&quot; (1986), a joined Soviet-Japanese feature co-directed with Kenji Yoshida. Leonid Nosyrev explored the Russian North folklore with a number of ethnographical films based on the stories by Boris Shergin, Stepan Pisakhov and Yuri Koval. In 1987, seven of them were combined into a &quot;Laughter and Grief by the White Sea&quot; feature film.

One of the most famous Russian animators is Yuri Norstein. His films &quot;Hedgehog in the Fog&quot; (1975) and &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; (1979) won numerous awards at international festivals. &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; was named the best animation film of all time at the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles and at the 2002 Animafest Zagreb. Since the beginning of perestroika Norstein has been working on &quot;The Overcoat&quot;.

Vladimir Popov had been known since the 1960s for his shorts such as &quot;Umka&quot;, but it was the &quot;Three from Prostokvashino&quot; trilogy (1978–1984) that brought him fame. The characters and their catchphrases entered Russian folklore, and it was chosen the third best animation of all time in the 2014 poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation. In 2018 the series was rebooted.

Vladimir Tarasov was a rare Soviet director who dedicated himself to the science fiction genre. Among his prominent works were &quot;Contact&quot; (1978) influenced by &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;Shooting Range&quot; (1979), &quot;Contract&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Pass&quot; (1988).

Stanislav Sokolov brought stop motion to a new height. His approach characterized by complex animation structures and multiple special effects could be observed in the award-winning &quot;Black and White Film&quot; (1984) or &quot;The Big Underground Ball&quot; (1987). During late years, few animated films were produced due to the lack of financing from government. Garri Bardin who also specialized on stop motion films made of matches, ropes and wire, was one of those few directors who managed to cope with the political changes. His &quot;Grey Wolf &amp; Little Red Riding Hood&quot; (1991) was full of allusions to the upcoming end of the USSR.

== Other Soviet studios ==
Kievnauchfilm was founded in 1941. Although it was created to produce popular science films, it eventually became best known for its animated films, and remained active in Ukrainian animation for decades.

In 1968, a group of mathematicians led by Nikolay Konstantinov released a 1.5-minute non-narrative animation &quot;&quot;, one of the earliest examples of computer and procedural animation in history programmed on BESM-4. Cat&#x27;s movements and mimics were modelled using the second-order differential equation system. It was also one of the first attempts to render realistic animal motion digitally. Programmed at the Moscow State Pedagogical University, &quot;Kitty&quot; was made into a movie and screened at the Moscow State University. It was later shown to students at mathematics competitions and used for educational purposes at schools.

From 1970 on, new studios appeared across the RSFSR, most famously Multtelefilm division of Studio Ekran (Moscow) that focused on lower-budget television animation. It was known for several popular TV series such as &quot;Leopold the Cat&quot; (1975–1987), &#x27; (1984–1987), &quot;Investigation Held by Kolobki&quot; (1986–1987) and &#x27; (1986–1988), as well as various experiments. re-discovered paint-on-glass animation with films like &quot;Wonders&quot; (1980), &quot;&quot; (1982) and (1984), while Alexander Tatarsky pioneered clay animation with &quot;Plasticine Crow&quot; (1981), &quot;Last Year&#x27;s Snow Was Falling&quot; (1983) and the &quot;Good Night, Little Ones!&quot; opening (computerized in 2002 as the very first CGI Animation in Russia, made for state television). He and his students also practiced total animation (flying camera with characters and backgrounds moving simultaneously).

Multtelefilm served as a base for Pilot, the first private Soviet animation studio founded by Alexander Tatarsky and Igor Kovalyov in 1988. They aimed at both auteur and commercial animation, producing absurd adult-themed films. In several years half of the team left Russia to work for Klasky Csupo where they created popular animated series such as &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;.

The Sverdlovsk Film Studio also gained fame for its paint-on-glass animation with complete new level of quality by and Aleksandr Petrov (&quot;Welcome!&quot;, &quot;The Cow&quot;), as well as sand animation by Vladimir and Elena Petkevich (&quot;A Small Tale of a Small Bug&quot;). The rest included the animation department at Lennauchfilm that produced educational and popular science films, the Permtelefilm studio (Perm) responsible for TV animation mostly based on the Ural folklore, Kuybyshevtelefilm (Kuybyshev) known for its stop motion &quot;Forest Tales&quot; series, Saratovtelefilm (Saratov) and some others.

In 1989, another independent studios Christmas Films was founded by Soyuzmultfilm veterans that focused on international coproduction. It became famous during later years with the Russian-British &quot;&quot; series (1992–1994) that earned several Primetime Emmy Awards.

== Russian animation today ==

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the situation for Russian animators changed dramatically. Due to the new management and the lack of state funding, many of them left Soyuzmultfilm, which was turned into a leased enterprise. In 1993, Yuri Norstein, Fyodor Khitruk, Andrei Khrzhanovsky and Eduard Nazarov founded the SHAR Studio meant for training animators and producing films. Garri Bardin also founded the Stayer animation studio where he continued directing claymation and stop motion films. Others joined Pilot, Christmas Films, Animation Magic and similar companies that lived on advertisement and commissioned works for big studios from Western countries.

In 1992, Films by Jove, an American company ran by Oleg Vidov and his wife Joan Borsten, signed a nine-year contract with the new Soyuzmultfilm director Stanislav Rozhkov that gave them exclusive distribution and editing rights for the major part of the studio&#x27;s collection. They were supposed to share incomes, but only after their expenses would&#x27;ve been paid off. As a result, animators received nothing for their past works. In 1993, they elected a new director, a shady businessman Sergei Skulyabin who promised to turn the studio into a joint-stock company. Instead he signed a new contract with Vidov, extending it from nine to twenty years and returning a number of non-profitable films. His plan was to sell exclusive rights for all past and future films to his dummy corporation and bankrupt the studio.

When animators realized it, they managed to overthrow him with the help from the Union of Cinematographers and Goskino, although the Ministry of State Property still refused to step in and return the studio the state status. Skulyabin also refused to leave the director&#x27;s chair up until 30 June 1999 when Sergei Stepashin finally signed a long-awaited order that turned Soyuzmultfilm into a unitary enterprise. By that time the production completely stopped. In 2001 the High Court of Arbitration of Russia returned the rights to the whole collection back to Soyuzmultfilm which led to a legal battle with Films by Jove. Only in 2007 Vidov and Borsten agreed to sell the collection to the Russian business magnate Alisher Usmanov who donated it to the state-run children&#x27;s channel Bibigon. Around the same time the studio came back to life.

Nevertheless, there were a few very successful international co-productions, e.g. the aforementioned &quot;&quot; and Aleksandr Petrov&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; (1999). An ambitious project in 12 series &quot;Dunno on the Moon&quot; was released between 1997 and 1999. Based on the Soviet sci-fi novel of the same name, it was produced at Aleksei Guskov&#x27;s F.A.F. Entertainment in the best traditions of Soviet hand-made animation. Despite the hardships, Natalya Lukinykh has estimated that Russian animated films won about twice as many prestigious international awards in the 1990s as Russian live-action films.

As Russia&#x27;s economic situation became increasingly stable, so did the market for animation, and during the last three years, a number of feature-length animation films from Russian studios have emerged (e.g. Melnitsa Animation Studio&#x27;s &quot;Little Longnose&quot;, 2003, from Wilhelm Hauff&#x27;s fairy tale, and Solnechny Dom Studio&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Prince Vladimir&quot;, based on early history of Rus&#x27; – the highest-grossing Russian animated film to date). While the Russian animation community is yet far from reaching the splendor it possessed before the end of the Soviet Union, a significant recovery is being made and it is becoming more and more clear that the revived Russian animation industry will be very different from what it was in the late 1980s. According to Andrei Dobrunov, head of Solnechny Dom, several Russian studios are currently working on some ten animated feature films.

&quot;Especial&quot; released on July 31, 2006 was Russia&#x27;s first CG-animated feature film. At the same time, Soyuzmultfilm has partnered up with Mihail Chemiakin and is working on &quot;Hoffmaniada&quot;, a puppet-animated feature film which is deliberately being made entirely without computers. In 2007, the Morevna Project was launched, aiming at creating a science fiction re-telling the folk-tale of Marya Morevna as an anime primarily by using the free software Synfig tool and releasing it under a Creative Commons license. Other popular Russian Internet cartoons include &quot;Masyanya&quot; and &quot;Mr. Freeman&quot;. A corporate collaboration between the Japanese Studio 4°C and Russia&#x27;s Molot Entertainment did also produce the anime film &quot;First Squad&quot; (2009), which won the &quot;Kommersant&quot; newspaper&#x27;s prize. The film was finally released in 2018.

Beginning in 2009, animation entered a new crisis as Goskino indefinitely postponed funding for all projects, and for the 2010 budget the state cut animation funding by half. The animation community reacted by appealing to the President and the public. In 2010, many of the major studios, including Pilot, were either closed or on the verge of shutting down. The vast majority of studios had relied on state support to some extent, and Goskino did not fulfill any of their contractual obligations to pay for the films that they had ordered and which the studios had already produced. In addition, Disney has been accused of using anti-competitive practices to sideline domestic Russian competition on TV channels.

The Center of National Film CG animated film &quot;Space Dogs&quot;, released on March 18, 2010 and about the Soviet space dogs Strelka and Belka, received an English release on June 8, 2012 and spawned a broader franchise. Wizart Animation, alongside InlayFilm, also produced a new CG film version of &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (2012), spawning a new franchise with sequels &quot;The Snow Queen 2&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice&quot; (2016), alongside their first fully original concept &quot;Sheep and Wolves&quot; (2016).

Animaccord Animation Studio has had success in CG television animation with its children&#x27;s series &quot;Masha and the Bear&quot; (2009–present), whose emphasis on pantomime has helped it export outside of the country, premièring on the US version of Netflix in August 2015. Another long running, educational, children&#x27;s series by Melnitsa Animation Studio called &quot;Luntik&quot; has aired since September 1, 2006. An earlier success in this market was &quot;Kikoriki&quot; which aired from May 7, 2004 until 2012, produced by Petersburg Animation Studio with assistance from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation. English-language distribution rights to the series were acquired by 4Kids Entertainment from worldwide distributor Fun Game Media, Munich and began airing as part of The CW4Kids block on The CW on September 13, 2008, under the name &quot;GoGoRiki&quot;. In 2011 a prequel feature film was released entitled &quot;Kikoriki. Team Invincible&quot; and further films are planned. A connecting factor in many recent Russian animated efforts is Timur Bekmambetov, whose Bazelevs Company has helped produce, finance and promote &quot;Kikoriki&quot; and &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;.

In 2010, the animated series The Fixies premiered on Karusel and Russia 1.

In 2018, Soyuzmultfilm, announced plans to restore films from its Golden Collection. On 5 December 2020, the second part of the Golden Collection was restored and released theatrically by United Network &quot;Cinema Park&quot; in Russia. The release was followed up online premiere service viewing options.

<text>Barrow is an old lunar impact crater that is located near the northern limb of the Moon. It lies between the crater Goldschmidt to the northwest and the irregular formation Meton to the northeast. To the southwest is W. Bond.

The outer wall of Barrow has been heavily eroded by subsequent impacts, and reshaped by intruding craters. As a result, the rim now resembles a ring of rounded hills and peaks surrounding the flat interior. The younger satellite crater Barrow A lies across the southwest rim. At the eastern end of the crater is a narrow gap in the rim that joins the floor to the adjacent crater Meton. The rim achieves its maximum height and extend in the northwest, where it is joined to Goldschmidt.

The interior of Barrow has been resurfaced by lava flows, leaving a flat surface that is marked by many tiny craterlets. Faint traces of ray material from Anaxagoras to the west forms streaks across the floor of Barrow.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Barrow.

<doc id="1060955" wikidata="Q7487246" url="?curid=1060955" title="Shall We Tell the President?">
<text>Shall We Tell the President? is a 1977 novel by English author Jeffrey Archer. A revised edition was published in 1986. 

In the first edition, a plot to kill the President of the United States, Edward Kennedy, is foiled by Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Mark Andrews working with the head of the FBI. A love story complicates the plot. The book includes descriptive details of official Washington, for which the author lists sources.

The U.S. edition of the novel was published by Viking Press, where Kennedy&#x27;s sister-in-law Jacqueline Onassis was then a consulting editor. Although Onassis was not involved in editing &quot;Shall We Tell the President?&quot;, she was criticized for not trying to deter her employer from publishing a novel about an assassination plot against a member of the Kennedy family. She resigned from Viking Press shortly after the publication.

After the success of &quot;Kane and Abel&quot; and &quot;The Prodigal Daughter&quot;, Archer published a revised edition of &quot;Shall We Tell the President?&quot;, replacing Kennedy (in real life a senator and a presidential candidate but never president) with the fictional character Florentyna Kane (who became president in &quot;The Prodigal Daughter&quot;) in order to link it with the other two novels. He also replaced Vice President Dale Bumpers (in real life governor and a senator) with the real-life Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. The author makes frequent references to William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

== Plot ==
A Greek man, Angelo Casefikis, enters a hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg demanding to speak to the FBI. Nick Stames, the head of the Washington field office, tasks agents Mark Andrews and Barry Calvert to take his testimony and they learn of a plot against the life of President Florentyna Kane with the involvement of an unnamed US Senator. Stames and Calvert are soon murdered, as is Casefikis in the hospital, leaving only Andrews alive with knowledge of the plot.

Andrews reports what he knows to the FBI Director Horatio Tyson, and becomes his direct report for the 7 days until the planned assassination. Investigating a number of US Senators who could potentially have been at the lunch where Casefikis overheard the conspiracy, Andrews begins to narrow down the suspects. Alongside his investigation, he begins a romantic relationship with Elizabeth Dexter, the daughter of potential conspirator Senator Henry Dexter. As Andrews gets closer to discovering the truth, he comes to the attention of the five conspirators, who decide to murder him with a car bomb on the day of the planned assassination. Having narrowed down the suspect US Senator to two persons - Robert Harrison and Henry Dexter - Andrews escapes the attempt on his life by a coincidence when Elizabeth visits his apartment and offers him a ride. When a moment of recall reveals to Andrews that Elizabeth had lunched with her father on the day Casefikis was shot, he realises the only possible conspirator is Harrison. The plot is foiled and three of the five conspirators are captured, but not before one of them shoots Harrison with a sniper rifle.

Andrews is injured in an attempt to shield Harrison from gunfire, but survives while Harrison perishes. President Kane personally congratulates him for his act of bravery, knowing nothing of the plot or of Harrison&#x27;s involvement. Andrews rebuilds his intermittently frosty relationship with Elizabeth and accepts Tyson&#x27;s offer of a new job.

==Suspected senators==
In the novel, some United States Senators, both real-life and fictional Democrats and Republicans, are suspected as a part of the plot to kill the president, many of them just because they were present in D.C. at a certain time.

=== Fictional ===
* Ralph Brooks (D-IL), political rival of President Kane from previous books in the series
* Marvin Thornton (D-MA)
* Robert Duncan (later renamed Harrison) (R-SC)
* Henry Dexter (R-CT), father of Mark&#x27;s girlfriend, Dr. Elizabeth Dexter

=== Real ===
* Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-WV)
* Birch Bayh (D-IN)
* Charles Mathias (R-MD)
* Adlai Stevenson III (D-IL)
* John Glenn (D-OH)
* Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY)
* James Abourezk (D-SD)
* Quentin N. Burdick (D-ND)
* Sam Nunn (D-GA)

<text>Byrd is an irregular lunar impact crater that is located near the north pole of the Moon. The north rim of Byrd is nearly connected to the crater Peary, a formation that is adjacent to the pole. The smaller crater Gioja is attached to the remains of the southwest rim.

The rim of Byrd is worn and eroded, with sections distorted by intruding crater rims along the perimeter. As a result, the crater interior is longer in the north–south direction than it is wide. There is a gap in the western rim, and the southern rim is now little more than a low ridge on the surface.

Some time after the original impact the crater interior was covered in lava flows, leaving a nearly flat surface that is marked only by tiny craterlets. There is no central peak at the midpoint of the interior and no ridges of significance.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Byrd.

<doc id="1060966" wikidata="Q3631636" url="?curid=1060966" title="Aériane Swift">
<text>The Aériane Swift is a lightweight (48 kg) foot-launched tailless sailplane whose rigid wings have a span of 40 feet. The Swift has been succeeded by the &quot;Swift&#x27;Lite&quot;.

Although designed in California, Swift aircraft are now manufactured by Aériane, a European firm based in Gembloux, Belgium. Aériane first manufactured the Swift under licence, but the firm is now the sole manufacturer.

==Design &amp; development==
The Swift (an acronym for &#x27;Swept Wing with Inboard Flap for Trim&#x27;) was originally conceived as a rigid hang glider with sailplane-like performance. Bright Star Gliders had developed the 1989 U.S. National Hang Gliding Championship winning Odyssey prototype. Meanwhile Professor Ilan Kroo and a group of graduate students at Stanford University had developed the Stanford SWIFT design project. When Brian Porter of Bright Star met Stanford student Steve Morris, the projects merged. Bright Star constructed the revised SWIFT and its first flight took place in December 1989.

The swept wing has control surfaces along the entire trailing edge: flaps occupy the inner 42%, and elevons take up 58% of the outer span. Large winglets act as vertical stabilizers and the models with an enclosed cockpit also have conventional fuselage stabilising surfaces that contribute to yaw stability. The winglets on the 1989 prototype were fixed surfaces, so the pilot effected turns using the elevons.

The original Swift is now out of production, having been replaced by a refined version called the Swift&#x27;Lite. This new model has winglets that, like those on the Rutan Long-EZ, are rudders when used singly, and air-brakes when used together. In addition, compared to its predecessor, the Swift&#x27;Lite is claimed to be: 20% lighter, with lighter and more responsive controls, a lower stall speed, an improved glide ratio of 27:1, better pilot visibility and comfort, and simplified assembly procedure.

==Model range==
A variety of different &quot;fuselage pods&quot; have been fitted beneath the wings to create a range of aircraft, as follows: 
*the core product is the foot-launched glider (the Swift&#x27;Lite)
*a self-launching glider (the Swift-PAS) with two-stroke engine, later with an 18 hp Bailey 175 four stroke engine 
*a motor-glider (the P-Swift) with 2-stroke engine
*an electric-powered variant (Swift-Light E) has 20 minutes of powered flight per charge. Power comes from an Eck-Geiger HPD-10, 10-kilowatt motor, controller and battery system, part of a setup designed and sold by Austrian hang-gliding champion Manfred Ruhmer.
* a two-seat glider used for training (the Tandem Swift) 
The various fuselage frames are interchangeable and any can be added to the same basic wing. Swift gliders with engines originally had Arplast EcoProp folding propellers, which feather for soaring when then engine is turned off. Powered Swift gliders are not foot-launched, having instead two main wheels in tandem layout, and small wing-tip castors.

===Current types===
As of October 2020, Aériane are producing only 2 versions of the Swift&#x27;Lite:
* The Swift’Light, foot-launchable, and
* The E-Swift’Light, with an electric motor.

<text>Hale is a relatively young lunar impact crater that is located on the southern limb of the Moon. Over half the crater lies on the far side of the Moon, and from the Earth this formation is viewed from the side. Thus the crater must be viewed from orbit in order to discern much detail. The nearest crater of note is Wexler to the north. To the east on the far side is the huge walled plain Schrödinger, and to the southwest is the crater Demonax.

The rim of Hale is well-defined, with little wear from later impacts, but has a somewhat irregular, notched perimeter. The inner surface is multiply d with some indications of slumping. The inner floor is flat with only a few tiny craterlets to mark the surface. Near the midpoint of the interior is a complex central peak formation, with an additional low rise just to the north.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hale.

<doc id="1060979" wikidata="Q4738706" url="?curid=1060979" title="Alys Faiz">
<text>Alys Faiz (Urdu:; September 1915 – 12 March 2003) was a Pakistani poet, writer, journalist, human rights activist, social worker and a teacher. Alys was born in London, but she later became a naturalized citizen of Pakistan. She was the wife of Faiz Ahmad Faiz and the mother of Salima Hashmi and Muneeza Hashmi.

==Early life==

Alys George was the daughter of a London bookseller, and she joined the Communist Party as a teenager. She and her sister, Christobel, were active in leftist circles in the 1930s and were close to Indian intellectuals based in London. Alys served as an unofficial secretary to Krishna Menon, the secretary of the Free Indian League. 
Christobel married Dr. M. D. Taseer and joined him in India where he was the principal of a college. Alys traveled to India in 1938 to visit her sister, and, when World War II broke out, she decided to make the subcontinent her home.

==Marriage and life in Pakistan==

The nikaah (marriage deed) between Alys George and Faiz was solemnized by Sheikh Abdullah in Srinagar in 1941 at Pari Mahal, the summer palace of Maharaja Hari Singh and where &quot;M D Taseer&quot;, then the principal of S.P. College was living.Upon marriage, Alys converted to Islam and Faiz gave her the Muslim name &quot;Kulsoom&quot;.
 Alys Faiz joined Pakistan Times newspaper&#x27;s editorial staff in 1950 where Faiz Ahmad Faiz was already serving as the newspaper editor. She looked after the women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s section of the newspaper.

==Family ==

She was the aunt of Salmaan Taseer, the son of her sister Christobel.

Alys had two daughters with Faiz: Salima Hashmi and Muneeza Hashmi. The artist Adeel Hashmi is her grandson.

==Her legacy==

After her death, Habib R. Sulemani wrote in &quot;The Dawn&quot; newspaper, &quot;During my decade-long stay in Lahore, as a silent observer of the literary-scene, I was fascinated by her life-story which made me believe that women are stronger than men and have an immense power and talent for reconciliation and bridging the gaps between two families or nations. Alys gave courage to many western women who were married to Pakistanis and now live here as citizens. Alys gave many sacrifices. Faiz Ahmad Faiz&#x27;s life and poetry have influenced hundreds of thousands of people in one way or the other, but Alys has shaped his life and poetry. A study of Faiz, as a person and a poet, cannot be complete without a study of Alys. Rather I should say she needs a special treat on her own right as a writer and a poet.

A recent dramatic Production &#x27;Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan&#x27; focussed for the first time on the inimitable chemistry between Faiz and Alys. &#x27;Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan&#x27; presents the hitherto unknown aspects of their life together with the help of letters exchanged between them, particularly during &#x27;Rawalpindi Saazish&#x27; days. In one such production at Amritsar, renowned theatre actress Suchitra Gupta portrayed the role of Alys with Danish Iqbal. So, apart from a few newspaper articles and interviews in books, this production is the first ever attempt to pay tribute to the silent role played by Alys in shaping the life of Faiz.&quot;

==Death==

Alys Faiz died on 12 March 2003 in Lahore, Pakistan, at a hospital at the age of 87. She had been unwell for some time and was confined to her house after suffering a fracture of the hipbone in a fall. She was taken to the emergency department of a local hospital for treatment and did not survive. She was buried in the Model Town, Lahore, graveyard by the side of her husband Faiz Ahmad Faiz who had died earlier on 20 November 1984.

<text>Schrödinger is a large lunar impact crater of the form traditionally called a walled plain and is named after Erwin Schrödinger. It is located near the south lunar pole on the far side of the Moon, and can only be viewed from orbit. 

The smaller crater Ganswindt is attached to the southwestern rim of Schrödinger, and intrudes slightly into the inner wall. Adjacent to the south is the crater Nefed&#x27;ev. Farther to the southwest is the crater Amundsen.

Schrödinger is perhaps the moon&#x27;s best example of a peak-ring basin. It possesses a wide outer rim that has been slightly rounded due to subsequent impacts. But the rim remains well-defined, and traces of s can be seen along the inner surface. The ejecta on the exterior forms an irregular outer that extends for up to 100 kilometers. Within the interior is a second ring approximately half the diameter of the outer rim. This forms a circular range of rugged mountains that surrounds the center, with the exception of a wide gap in the south. The remainder of the floor has been resurfaced by subsequent lava flows, producing a relatively flat surface particularly within the inner ring. The exception is an area of rough ground in the southeast part of the interior.

A complex of rilles has formed across the floor, forming multiple clefts particularly in the south. The floor has also been marked by subsequent impacts, leaving tiny craterlets scattered across the surface. There is no central peak at the midpoint of the interior.

There is a long, narrow valley leading directly away from Schrödinger to the northwest, designated Vallis Schrödinger. This formation begins some distance from the outer rim of the crater, at the edge of the ejecta that surrounds the perimeter. It extends to the rim of the crater Moulton. Another similar valley designated Vallis Planck radiates to the north, beginning near the crater Grotrian at the periphery of the Schrödinger ejecta, and extending past Fechner.

The Schrödinger impact basin is one of a few locations on the Moon that show evidence of geologically recent volcanic activity. A geological study of the basin shows evidence of lava flows and eruptions from vents. There is also older volcanic material and material scattered because of impacts. The volcanic vent is called Schrödinger G, and is thought to be Imbrian in age.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Schrödinger.

==Popular culture==

Schrödinger crater is the location of the Moon Nazi base, &quot;Schwarze Sonne&quot;, in the Finnish film &quot;Iron Sky&quot;.

<doc id="1060988" wikidata="Q704027" url="?curid=1060988" title="Fruit Chan">
<text>Fruit Chan Gor (; born 15 April 1959) is a Hong Kong filmmaker who is best known for his style of film reflecting the everyday life of Hong Kong people. He is well known for using amateur actors (such as Sam Lee in &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot;, Wong Yau-Nam in &quot;Hollywood Hong Kong&quot;) in his films. He became a household name after the success of the 1997 film &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot;, which earned many local and international awards.

==Early life==
Chan was born in Guangdong, China. His English name is a calque (literal translation) of his personal name Guo (果). Growing up, he watched a lot of films from Communist countries.

He and his family moved to Hong Kong in July 1971. His family was poor and Chan worked in an electronics factory while finishing Forms 1 to 3 at night school. He later got a job as a projectionist in Jordan, Hong Kong, where he developed an interest in international cinema.

He later enrolled in a one-year film studies course at the Film Culture Society, garnering admission by lying about his secondary education experience and working odd jobs to pay for tuition.

== Career ==
He continued his interest in film later on at the Hong Kong Film Culture Centre, a small film club, where he studied script writing and directing. In 1982, after only one year of working at the Hong Kong Film Culture Centre he started his career in the film industry. He began his career as an assistant director to David Lai Dai-Wai in the film &quot;Mid-Night Girls&quot;. He later worked as an assistant director to mainstream directors Jackie Chan, Kirk Wong, Ronny Yu, and Shu Kei.

His break came in 1991 when a film he was working with stopped its production. Chan took this as an opportunity; he used the same studio to direct &quot;Finale in Blood&quot;. However, the outcome of the first of his own films was highly praised by the critics rather than the public. In 1994 he collected a total of 500,000 HKD and film-materials left over by other productions to begin directing his award-winning &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot;. After &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot; came out he was thought of as the hope for Hong Kong cinema by fellow Hong Kong filmmakers for challenging the stable model of Hong Kong filmmaking. He had become the first filmmaker to, independently of the big studios, challenge the genre of Hong Kong films and make realistic films about the political and social situations going on in Hong Kong at the time. The film was the first part to a trilogy that included &quot;The Longest Summer&quot; and &quot;Little Cheung&quot;.

In 2002, Chan was a member of the jury at the 24th Moscow International Film Festival.

Chan was selected to head the jury for the 2015 Taipei Film Festival.

== Style and influences ==
Chan lists Japanese directors, particularly from the 1960s such as Nagisa Ōshima, as his primary influences. Ōshima specifically was the influence for Chan&#x27;s film &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot; (1997).

Chan&#x27;s films often focus on the &quot;raw, often bleak, view of life of Hong Kong&#x27;s working class.&quot;

<text>...And Then There Were Three... (stylised in all lowercase) is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Genesis. It was released on 31 March 1978 by Charisma Records and is their first recorded as a trio of singer/drummer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford, following the departure of guitarist Steve Hackett. The album marked a shift in the band&#x27;s sound, mixing elements of their progressive rock roots with more accessible material, and Collins contributing to more of the group&#x27;s songwriting.

The album received mixed reviews from critics, but reached on the UK Albums Chart and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The lead single &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; became their highest charting at that point, reaching in the UK and in the US. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1988 for selling one million copies in the US. To further promote it, Genesis toured worldwide with live guitarist Daryl Stuermer and drummer Chester Thompson, both of whom would become mainstays of the band&#x27;s touring lineup for the next three decades. The album was remixed in 2007 as part of the &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; box set in 5.1 surround sound and a new stereo mix by Nick Davis.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
In July 1977, the Genesis line-up of drummer and vocalist Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, guitarist Steve Hackett, and touring drummer Chester Thompson completed their tour in support of their eighth studio album, &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;. The band proceeded to edit and mix their second live album, &quot;Seconds Out&quot;, in August 1977, during which time Hackett left the band to pursue a solo career. Already having released one solo album in 1975, &quot;Voyage Of The Acolyte&quot;, Hackett had become increasingly frustrated by the band&#x27;s lack of interest in his ideas. Further, since Genesis had recently performed at Madison Square Garden, Hackett felt the group had reached its pinnacle and thus he had no reason to continue performing with them. His departure was not made public until 8 October, when Collins, Banks, and Rutherford were promoting &quot;Seconds Out&quot;. The trio were confident they could carry on, as they had formed the backbone of several Genesis classics, including the &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; section of &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, the instrumental part of &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; and the basics of &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; (written while Hackett was working on his first solo album). They also agreed not to hire a replacement for Hackett, choosing instead to perform all instrumental work on their albums themselves going forward.

=== Writing and recording ===
Rehearsals began at Shepperton Studios and lasted for around six weeks. In September 1977, the remaining three members returned to Relight Studios in Hilvarenbeek, Netherlands to write and record their new album, the same venue as used for the &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; album. The group wished to record in a new location, but they could not find a studio that fit their needs and did not wish to travel too far from England. Rutherford wished to remain in London, but noted recording abroad was their &quot;one tax concession&quot;. Joining the group was audio engineer and co-producer David Hentschel who had worked on the band&#x27;s past two albums. Genesis also shared production duties and are credited on the album&#x27;s sleeve. According to Rutherford, the material was recorded in two weeks. The band considered auditioning for a new guitarist or utilising a studio guitarist for the album, but Rutherford felt confident enough in his skills to take on the lead guitar parts himself, feeling he would enjoy the challenge of doing so. Banks noticed recording as a three-member band was an easier and more pleasurable experience than before as each member had a clearly defined role, which reduced the risk of personnel clashes along the way. Rutherford became aware that with three members, the basic tracks came across as sparse and not so easy to understand until the overdubs were recorded on top of them. Following the recording, the group mixed the album at Trident Studios in London.

Banks (four songs) and Rutherford (three songs) remained the dominant songwriters, with the remaining songs being one from Banks and Collins, and three tracks written by all three members. Collins had settled down with his wife and two children in South Ealing, and did not find much time to bring new songs to the sessions. Rutherford later said he was impressed the group wrote &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;, as they had had difficulty in the past writing songs that worked within a four minute framework. The majority of the album was formed of pre-written songs, not ones developed from jams and improvisations. Collins later thought the album lacked &quot;rich, jazzy pieces&quot; like &quot;Los Endos&quot; from &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; with its merging of rhythm and melody, but he could not contribute such ideas as it was difficult to play the drums in his flat in Ealing with his wife and two children. The group were still growing in popularity in the United States and despite &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot;, did not have a hit single, which Banks later admitted was a struggling point for them. The original album track order swapped &quot;Undertow&quot; with &quot;Many Too Many&quot; and &quot;Scenes from a Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, before it was changed as the band felt it flowed better.

=== Sleeve design ===
As with their past three studio albums, the album cover and packaging was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. Thorgerson later said the cover was &quot;trying to tell a story by the traces left by the light trails&quot;. Models were used for the cover shot, not the members of the band. The photograph was shot using time-lapse to represent the &quot;comings and goings&quot; in the album&#x27;s lyrics, and over the change in personnel.

== Writing ==
The album marked a change in the band&#x27;s sound, moving from their progressive rock roots towards shorter, more concise songs. The motivation for this was to enable more musical ideas to be put on a single album, and to act as a response to the newly emerging punk rock and new wave scenes, where short and concise songs were standard. Collins recognised how this decision gave the impression that Genesis was aiming to become &quot;a singles band&quot; that prioritised commercial success over artistic credibility, but maintained that the new material remained &quot;fundamentally the same&quot;. Rutherford in particular wanted to forge his own style and not copy Hackett&#x27;s distinctive guitar tones, so the album was more dominated by Banks&#x27; keyboards, with sparser and simpler guitar parts.

=== Side one ===
&quot;Down And Out&quot;, one of the three tracks written collectively, was created during the band&#x27;s rehearsals. Thompson found its more complex time signature difficult to reproduce on stage at first as Collins could not explain the riff and rhythm which Rutherford noted merely &quot;added to the confusion&quot;. Collins wrote the lyrics, which concern American record labels who drop artists when they are no longer in fashion; the chorus is spoken from the artists&#x27;s view and the verses from the label.

The band had originally planned to develop and arrange Banks&#x27;s song &quot;Undertow&quot; further, but its basic track of guitar, drums and piano, coupled with its simple chorus, was strong enough to remain intact. Banks plays a Yamaha electric grand piano on the track which also incorporates voice loops made by the band that were kept &quot;low-key and subtle&quot; in the final mix. Banks had written a two-minute introduction to the song, but recalled disagreement from the other members as there were enough keyboard parts on the album. The unused section was reworked and later used as a part of &quot;From The Undertow&quot;, a track on Banks&#x27;s first solo album &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot; (1979).

The lyrics to &quot;Ballad Of Big&quot; were written by Collins. The introduction contains a wobbly guitar effect created by Rutherford whereby he rubbed his guitar strings with pieces of metal, giving it a &quot;slightly Eastern strain&quot;. The end of the track has Banks and himself duelling between the Yamaha electric piano and his Roland guitar synthesiser.

For &quot;Snowbound&quot;, Collins originally recorded his drum part at a considerably faster pace before the group decided to slow it down in order to fit the style of the song. Collins and Rutherford described it as a romantic song, with its lyrics about a man who wears a snowman outfit to hide from people but while inside, becomes paranoid and finds he cannot get out.

While Banks was writing &quot;Burning Rope&quot;, he decided to shorten the track rather than stretch its arrangements into an extended piece as he wished to avoid repeating himself and drawing comparisons to his ten-minute &quot;One for the Vine&quot; from &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;. It features a lead guitar solo that Rutherford found was a challenge to produce in the wake of Hackett&#x27;s departure; he was pleased with the final result and called it his best on the album.

=== Side two ===
The original title to &quot;Deep In The Motherlode&quot; was &quot;Heavy&quot;. Rutherford uses a bottleneck slide guitar which he was inexperienced with at first to the point of placing it &quot;on the wrong hand&quot;.

&quot;Many Too Many&quot; features more lead guitar work from Rutherford. Once the basic tracks had been recorded, the group were unsure on how to finish the song and sought more instrumental parts to complete it, including a string sound Banks played on a Polymoog. At one point, they considered using orchestral instruments for the track but that idea was never attempted. Banks, who penned the song&#x27;s lyrics, recalled an issue Collins had with singing the word &quot;mama&quot; in the chorus; Banks had to reassure him that he could sing it. Banks also said in an interview that he actually played the string part on the Mellotron (its last appearance on a Genesis album) and a Roland string synth, as he felt &quot;the basic string sound on the Polymoog isn&#x27;t that great a string imitation&quot;.

&quot;Scenes From A Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; is based on a childhood dream, itself inspired by the cartoon strip character Little Nemo; that character was part of a book that Collins had previously bought for his brother. The song developed from a musical idea from Banks who wrote the first draft of its lyrics, but he gave up halfway through as he felt they were unsuitable. The band instead settled on a set of lyrics that Collins offered during down time while mixing at Trident Studios that brought in a different melody and more harmonies.

&quot;Say It&#x27;s Alright Joe&quot;, written by Rutherford and the penultimate track recorded for the album, is a torch song about an alcoholic who goes into a drunken stupor. The guitarist intended the track to be a &quot;piss-take on the Dean Martin &#x27;set &#x27;em up Joe&#x27; alcoholic style&#x27;&quot;, but thought it was not going to work until Banks added his keyboard overdubs and the band started mixing the track, at which point it &quot;came to life&quot;.

The introduction to &quot;The Lady Lies&quot; was meant to have a &quot;strippers feel to it. Hence the title&quot;.

Genesis deliberately planned to close the album on a &quot;lighter note&quot; as a contrast to the heavier tracks on the record, so they placed &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; at the end. This was the only track on the album that had been written during the rehearsal stage, and went through numerous interactions before the group settled on the three-minute arrangement for the song. Hentschel was dismissive of the song, but prepared an initial mix and presented it to the staff at Atlantic Records, who recognised it as a potential hit single for the band. The song was remixed and included on the album. The lyrics were written by Rutherford and were inspired by his wife. He later said it was the easiest set of lyrics he had written, spending &quot;about ten minutes&quot; on it.

== Release ==
&quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; was released in the UK on 31 March 1978 and in the US on 28 March on Atlantic Records. It reached on the UK Albums Chart during a 32-week stay on the chart and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album continued to sell, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 31 May 1978 for 500,000 copies sold in the US. It reached platinum status on 11 February 1988 for selling one million copies. The album was considered a commercial breakthrough for Genesis, as it brought in sufficiently large audiences to be able to make a profit from touring, which before then had always run at a loss.

Genesis released two singles from &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;, became their most successful since their formation, peaking at in the UK.
A digitally remastered version was released on CD in 1994 on Virgin in Europe and Atlantic in the US and Canada. A SACD / DVD double disc set (including new 5.1 and Stereo mixes) was released on 2 April 2007. It was released in the US and Canada as part of the &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; box set. This includes the album in remixed stereo and surround sound, and includes related video tracks. The only track not remixed is &quot;Say It&#x27;s Alright Joe&quot;, because the band was unable to locate the multitrack recordings.

== Critical reception ==
In an April 1978 review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, reporter Chris Welch praised the album as &quot;strong, confident&quot; that is &quot;as good as any they have made in the band&#x27;s post-Gabriel years&quot;. Welch noted the songs have &quot;a sense of purpose&quot; and come with &quot;a remarkably powerful sound&quot;, and picked &quot;Ballad Of Big&quot; as his favourite track. A review in &quot;The Town Talk&quot; praised the group for filling the gap Hackett left &quot;confidently&quot; and picks &quot;Down And Out&quot; as claim of their survival. The rest of the album is &quot;a tapestry of imaginary landscapes filled with the struggling mythic heroes that Genesis has learned to depict so well&quot;. Gary Mullinax for &quot;The Morning News&quot; thought the album sounded little different to &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; and noted the dominance of Banks&#x27;s keyboards over Rutherford&#x27;s guitars, with &quot;the same dreamy wall-of-sound music with the same high-pitched vocals&quot; from Collins. He concluded that Genesis succeed at points on the album but thought many songs on it fail to go anywhere, &quot;blending into one another like some sort of hip musak&quot;. Charley Walters, writing in &quot;Circus&quot;, said that despite the exits of Gabriel and Hackett, Genesis have sacrificed &quot;neither direction nor quality&quot;. The album, he thought, has &quot;hard, almost ominous&quot; tracks like &quot;Down And Out&quot; and &quot;softer, more melodic&quot; ones like &quot;Say It&#x27;s Alright Joe&quot;, all of which create &quot;a magical, mystical sound that sets them apart from the numerous similar but usually inferior European art-rock ensembles&quot;. He names Banks as the one of the trio most responsible for their sound with his &quot;rich&quot; arrangements complemented by Rutherford&#x27;s restrained guitar work which is &quot;more felt than heard&quot; which worked well to his praise on &quot;Burning Rope&quot;. Walters, however, thought Collins&#x27;s vocals has shortcomings that lacks expansion or breathtaking moments, though is a drummer who can still be melodic. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; opined that &quot;the songs still sound like Tennyson set to music, but it&#x27;s all done with precision and there isn&#x27;t a sound which is not beautiful, fat, ornate and quite lush&quot;.

Other reviewers were more critical of the album, including Jon Pareles and &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, who said that &quot;without lead guitarist Steve Hackett, the band loses its last remaining focal point; the rest is double-tracking. Hence a sound as mushy as the dread Moody Blues, with fewer excuses.&quot; In &quot;Crawdaddy&quot;, Michael Bloom found Banks&#x27;s arrangements and keyboard sounds poor, saying the melodies tend to &quot;practically vanish&quot; and &quot;slip through your fingers&quot;. He also declared Rutherford&#x27;s lead guitar playing &quot;unbearably clumsy&quot; compared to Hackett but acknowledged that Rutherford remains a &quot;rare bassist&quot; and his 12-string guitar playing reminded the reviewer of &quot;Trespass&quot; (1970) and the surrounding period in the band&#x27;s history. Bloom picked out &quot;The Lady Lies&quot; as Banks&#x27;s strongest contribution both musically and lyrically, comparing the composition and lyrical message to &quot;One For The Vine&quot; on &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;, and also highlighted &quot;Deep In The Motherlode&quot; as a strong track, but found Collins&#x27;s singing &quot;uniformly insipid&quot; and concluded that the album is &quot;less of a disappointment than an interminable frustration&quot;. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he panned Hackett&#x27;s then-current album &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch!&quot;, but also said that his ex-band fared even worse, concluding that &quot;this contemptible opus is but the palest shadow of the group&#x27;s earlier accomplishments.&quot;

Retrospective appraisals have also been mixed. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, J. D. Considine deemed it &quot;a genuine pop breakthrough&quot; that &quot;does hone the playing so that there&#x27;s less empty flash and wasted energy&quot;, while &quot;MusicHound Rock&quot; (1996) said it &quot;put Genesis on the radio with &#x27;Follow You, Follow Me&#x27; but lacked the meaty songcraft and ambitious arrangements of its predecessors&quot;.

== Tour ==
Genesis embarked on the ...And Then There Were Three... Tour between March and December 1978, including nearly 100 shows covering Europe, the US and Japan, with only a single UK show at Knebworth Park on 24 June. The US dates were important as they would allow the band to recoup touring costs, which were running at around $25,000 a day.

The group needed an additional touring member to cover all the material, but Rutherford only wanted to play lead guitar on the new songs from &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; and return to bass and twelve-string for everything else. The successful applicant would have to play bass on the new material and cover Hackett&#x27;s old lead parts. They first approached Weather Report&#x27;s Alphonso Johnson, but he was primarily a bassist and his style did not fit in with the rest of the band. Johnson suggested instead that they consider jazz-fusion guitarist Daryl Stuermer, who was already a Genesis fan. He tried out an audition in New York, playing bass on &quot;Down And Out&quot; and lead guitar on &quot;Squonk&quot; from 1976&#x27;s &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; and was immediately hired. &quot;The Fountain Of Salmacis&quot;, the closing track from 1971&#x27;s &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; was reintroduced into the live set, so Stuermer could take a song with a distinctive Hackett solo and put his own stamp on it. &quot;Say It&#x27;s Alright Joe&quot; was performed with Collins in character wearing a raincoat and using Banks&#x27; keyboards as a makeshift bar.

The tour had several breaks so the band could have time with their family at home. Collins later said the tour was &quot;an end of an era&quot; and thought the group did not need to play live as much in the future. The tour was a major factor in Collins&#x27; divorce from his first wife, as she felt he was away from home too often and needed support at home. A row with his wife cancelled plans for her and their children to join Collins on the Japanese leg, and Collins recalled: &quot;I went to Japan, and spent ten days drunk. I hated every minute of it. I couldn&#x27;t sing and everyone was concerned about my welfare although there was nothing anyone could do about it.&quot;

His later films include &quot;Footloose&quot; (1984), and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989). For the drama &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977) he received two Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director and received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director.

He is also known for his work on Broadway as a choreographer for productions for Barbra Streisand, Stephen Sondheim, Richard Rodgers, and Arthur Laurents. His credits include &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; in 1951, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in 1960, &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot; in 1962, and &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; in 1965. He was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Choreography for &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot; in 1964.

==Early life==
Ross was born on May 13, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Louis Chester Ross, a postal clerk, and his wife Martha (née Grundfast). His parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants. When Ross was nine, his mother died and his father moved the family to Miami and opened a luncheonette.

After dropping out of high school, Ross went to New York to pursue an acting career but became smitten with dance and studied dance.

==Career==
=== Theatre ===
Dancer

In 1942, Ross&#x27; stage debut came as &quot;Third Witch&quot; in a touring company of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. The next year brought his first Broadway performance credits with &quot;Something for the Boys&quot;, as a dancer. Ross was a dancer in &quot;Follow the Girls&quot; (1943–44), &quot;Laffing Room Only&quot; (1944–45), &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1946–47), and &quot;Look, Ma, I&#x27;m Dancin&#x27;!&quot;.

Choreographer

By 1950, he was a choreographer with the American Ballet Theatre and choreographed his first Broadway production, the Arthur Schwartz-Dorothy Fields musical adaptation of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1951). For TV he choreographed &quot;All Star Revue&quot;, &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;, and &quot;The Steve Allen Plymouth Show&quot;. Ross&#x27;s first film assignment came as an uncredited choreographer on &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954).

Back on Broadway he choreographed &quot;House of Flowers&quot; (1954) for Peter Brook, and &quot;The Body Beautiful&quot; (1958). He choreographed some TV specials: &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot; (1957), &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1958), &quot;Meet Me in St Louis&quot; (1959) and &quot;A Christmas Festival&quot; (1959). On Broadway Ross directed and choreographed a revival of &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1960). In 1965, Ross choreographed the original production of &quot;On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever&quot; and, without credit, took over the helm from the director of record, Robert Lewis, when the musical ran into trouble in Boston during its pre-Broadway tryout tour.

Ross went to England where he choreographed the feature film &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1961), starring Cliff Richard. He returned to Broadway to be musical director on &quot;The Gay Life&quot; (1961–62) and &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot; (1962), the latter directed by Arthur Laurents and starring Barbra Streisand. He did &quot;The Bacchantes&quot; (1961) for TV. Ross then choreographed a second Cliff Richard musical in England, &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1963). On Broadway he choreographed &quot;Tovarich&quot; (1963) with Vivien Leigh and &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot; (1964) with Laurents. For TV he did musical numbers for &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; (1964), &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, &quot;Delia Scala Show&quot; (1962), &quot;Rinaldo in campo&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Nut House!!&quot; (1964) and staged numbers for the films &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; (1965), &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966) and &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967).

On Broadway Ross directed and choreographed &quot;Kelly&quot; (1965), and choreographed &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; (1965) and &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; (1965-66). He did some additional staging on &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; (1966–67) directed by Mike Nichols. Ross was choreographer and director of musical numbers for &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), produced by Ray Stark.

=== Film ===
His film directorial debut came with the musical version of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), made by MGM-British, with Peter O&#x27;Toole and Petula Clark. It was produced by Arthur P. Jacobs who had made &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; two years prior, and just like that film, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; was a box-office disappointment. However, Ross&#x27; second feature as director, &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), was a big hit. The film was produced by Ray Stark and starred Streisand.

Ross did &quot;T.R. Baskin&quot; (1971) then &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; (1972), the latter produced by Jacobs and starring Woody Allen based on his play. Ross made &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973) co-written by Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins, and &quot;Funny Lady&quot; (1975) with Stark and Streisand. Ross directed &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975) based on a play and script by Neil Simon, starting a long collaboration between the two men; Stark produced. Ross directed &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977); Ross produced the latter.

Ross had two big hits with Simon scripts produced by Stark, &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977) and &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978). Ross returned to Broadway to direct Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Chapter Two&quot; (1977–79). After doing the ballet film &quot;Nijinsky&quot; (1980) he directed Simon&#x27;s &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot; (1980–81) on Broadway. He followed this with &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981) and the film version of &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot; (1982). His last film with Simon was &quot;Max Dugan Returns&quot; (1983).

===Later career===
Ross had a huge hit with &quot;Footloose&quot; (1984). He followed this with two comedies, &quot;Protocol&quot; (1984) with Goldie Hawn and &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1987) with Michael J. Fox. Less successful was &quot;Dancers&quot; (1987).

Ross had one last big hit with another play adaptation, &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989). In the 1990s, he directed &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (1990), &quot;True Colors&quot; (1991), &quot;Undercover Blues&quot; (1993) and &quot;Boys on the Side&quot; (1995).

==Personal life==
In 1959, he married Nora Kaye, a ballerina, with whom he produced four films. In 1987, his wife Nora died of cancer.

In September 1988, he married for the second time to Lee Radziwiłł, the younger sister of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The marriage ended in divorce in 2001, shortly before his death. In 2013, Radziwiłł described their relationship as follows:

He was certainly different from anybody else I&#x27;d been involved with, and the film world sounded exciting. Well, it wasn&#x27;t. I hated Hollywood, and the provincialism of the industry ... Herbert had been married to the ballerina Nora Kaye until she died, and unbeknownst to me was still obsessed by her. It was &#x27;Nora said this, Nora did it like that, Nora liked brown and orange.&#x27;

On October 9, 2001, Ross died from heart failure in New York City. A memorial was held for him at the Majestic Theater on West 44th Street in New York where Leslie Browne, Barbara Cook, Arthur Laurents, Marsha Mason, Mike Nichols and Mary-Louise Parker spoke of Ross. He was interred with Kaye in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="1061019" wikidata="Q1620992" url="?curid=1061019" title="Point-blank range">
<text>Point-blank range is any distance over which a certain firearm or gun can hit a target without the need to elevate the barrel to compensate for bullet drop, i.e. the gun can be pointed horizontally at the target. For targets beyond-blank range, the shooter will have to point the barrel of their firearm at a position above the target, and firearms that are designed for long range firefights usually have adjustable sights to help the shooter hit targets beyond point-blank range. The maximum point-blank range of a firearm will depend on a variety of factors such as muzzle velocity and the size of the target.

In popular usage, point-blank range has come to mean extremely close range with a firearm, yet not close enough to be a contact shot.

==History==
The term &quot;point-blank&quot; dates to the 1570s and is probably of French origin, deriving from , &quot;pointed at white&quot;. It is thought the word &quot;blanc&quot; may be used to describe a small white aiming spot formerly at the center of shooting targets. However, since none of the early sources mention a white center target, &quot;blanc&quot; may refer to empty space or zero point of elevation when testing range.

The term originated with the techniques used to aim muzzle-loading cannon. Their barrels tapered from breech to muzzle, so that when the top of the cannon was held horizontal, its bore actually sat at an elevated angle. This caused the projectile to rise above the natural line of sight shortly after leaving the muzzle, then drop below it after the apex of its slightly parabolic trajectory was reached.

By repeatedly firing a given projectile with the same charge, the point where the shot fell below the bottom of the bore could be measured. This distance was considered the &quot;point-blank range&quot;: any target within it required the gun to be depressed; any beyond it required elevation, up to the &quot;angle of greatest range&quot; at somewhat before 45 degrees.

Various cannon of the 19th century had point-blank ranges from (12 lb howitzer, powder charge) to nearly (30 lb carronade, solid shot, powder charge).

==Small arms==

===Maximum point-blank range===
Small arms are often sighted in so that their sight line and bullet path are within a certain acceptable margin out to the longest possible range, called the &quot;maximum point-blank range&quot;. Maximum point-blank range is principally a function of a cartridge&#x27;s external ballistics and target size: high-velocity rounds have long point-blank ranges, while slow rounds have much shorter point-blank ranges. Target size determines how far above and below the line of sight a projectile&#x27;s trajectory may deviate. Other considerations include sight height and acceptable drop before a shot is ineffective.

====Hunting====
A large target, like the vitals area of a deer, allows a deviation of a few inches (as much as 10 cm) while still ensuring a quickly disabling hit. Vermin such as prairie dogs require a much smaller deviation, less than an inch (about 2 cm). The height of the sights has two effects on point blank range. If the sights are lower than the allowable deviation, then point blank range starts at the muzzle, and any difference between the sight height and the allowable deviation is lost distance that could have been in point blank range. Higher sights, up to the maximum allowable deviation, push the maximum point blank range farther from the gun. Sights that are higher than the maximum allowable deviation push the start of the point blank range farther out from the muzzle; this is common with varmint rifles, where close shots are only sometimes made, as it places the point blank range out to the expected range of the usual targets.

====Military====
Known also as &quot;battle zero&quot;, maximum point-blank range is crucial in the military. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing their weapon&#x27;s sights on the center of mass of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are effectively irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. No height correction is needed at the &quot;battle zero&quot; or less distance, but it can result in a headshot or even a complete miss. The belt buckle is used as battle zero point of aim in Russian and former Soviet military doctrine.

The first mass-produced assault rifle, the World War II StG 44, and its preceding prototypes had iron sight lines elevated over the bore axis to extend point-blank range. The current trend for elevated sights and flatter shooting higher-velocity cartridges in assault rifles is in part due to a desire to further extend the maximum point-blank range, which makes the rifle easier to use. Raising the sight line over the bore axis, introduces an inherent parallax problem as the projectile path crosses the horizontal sighting plane twice. The point closest to the gun occurs while the bullet is climbing through the line of sight and is called the near zero. The second point occurs as the projectile is descending through the line of sight and is called the far zero. At closer ranges under the near zero range (typically inside ), the shooter must aim high to place shots where desired.
