<text>In mathematics, in particular in algebraic geometry, a complete algebraic variety is an algebraic variety , such that for any variety the projection morphism

:formula_1

is a closed map (i.e. maps closed sets onto closed sets). This can be seen as an analogue of compactness in algebraic geometry: a topological space is compact if and only if the above projection map is closed with respect to topological products.

The image of a complete variety is closed and is a complete variety. A closed subvariety of a complete variety is complete.

A complex variety is complete if and only if it is compact as a complex-analytic variety.

The most common example of a complete variety is a projective variety, but there do exist complete non-projective varieties in dimensions 2 and higher. While any complete nonsingular surface is projective, there exist nonsingular complete varieties in dimension 3 and higher which are not projective. The first examples of non-projective complete varieties were given by Masayoshi Nagata and Heisuke Hironaka. An affine space of positive dimension is not complete.

The morphism taking a complete variety to a point is a proper morphism, in the sense of scheme theory. An intuitive justification of &quot;complete&quot;, in the sense of &quot;no missing points&quot;, can be given on the basis of the valuative criterion of properness, which goes back to Claude Chevalley.

<text>In pyrotechnics a salute is a device primarily designed to make a loud report (bang), rather than have a visual effect, although most salutes also have a bright flash. They most commonly consist of a 70:30 mixture of potassium perchlorate and dark aluminium powder and may have titanium added for a cloud of sparks (titanium salute). The salute may be fired on the ground (ground salute) or launched from a mortar as a shell (aerial salute). Due to the nature of the effect, large salutes are some of the more hazardous fireworks.

Most of the &quot;salutes&quot; are made with flash powder. Flash powder has a fast burn rate, unlike black powder. 

All ground salutes over 50mg and air salutes over 130mg are restricted by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Child Protection Act of 1966.

==Examples of salutes==
*Cherry bomb
*M-80
*M-100
*Quarter stick

<text>Fin rot is the phenomenon where the fins of a fish gradually decay and are eventually destroyed. Typically, fin rot is either a symptom of a disease, oftentimes a bacterial or fungal infection, but it can also sometimes be a disease by itself. Fin rot is most often observed in aquaria and aquaculture, but can also occur in natural populations.

Fin rot can be the result of a bacterial infection (&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot;, which causes a ragged rotting of the fin), or as a fungal infection (which rots the fin more evenly and is more likely to produce a white &quot;edge&quot;). Sometimes, both types of infection are seen together. Infection is commonly brought on by bad water conditions, injury, poor diet, stress, or as a secondary infection in a fish which is already stressed by other disease.

Fin rot starts at the edge of the fins, and destroys more and more tissue until it reaches the fin base. If it does reach the fin base, the fish will never be able to regenerate the lost tissue. At this point, the disease may begin to attack the fish&#x27;s body; this is called advanced fin and body rot.

Fin rot is common in bettas due to poor water conditions in pet stores.

<text>Alexander I Aldea (1397 – December 1436) was a Voivode of Wallachia (1431–1436) from the House of Basarab, son of Mircea the Elder. He came to rule Wallachia during an extremely turbulent time when rule of the country changed hands by violence eighteen times during the 15th century. Alexander I took the throne by ousting Dan II of Wallachia, father to Basarab II. Dan II was on his 5th rule of Wallachia, having gone back and forth with Radu II several times over the course of seven years during the 1420s. He was strong enough to hold the throne for what was then a considerable time, a stretch of five years. However, in the winter of 1436 he died, most probably from illness, as there are no rumours to the contrary. Upon his death, his half-brother Vlad II Dracul assumed the throne and would hold it off and on until he was killed in 1447.

Alexander I was the uncle of Vlad Tepes (son of Vlad II Dracul).

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-27 (NATO reporting name &quot;Flashlight-C&quot;) is a family of Soviet supersonic aircraft developed in 1958 from the Yak-121 prototype. The most built variant was the tactical reconnaissance Yak-27R (NATO reporting name &quot;Mangrove&quot;).

==Design and development==
The Yak-121 prototype was developed as a successor to the Yak-25 family and it became the base for the Yak-27 family of supersonic interceptor and tactical reconnaissance aircraft. The Yak-27 and Yak-27K interceptors, armed with guns and K-8 missiles respectively, reached or exceeded their requirements, but were overtaken in performance by the Sukhoi Su-9, and so production was not authorized. A high-altitude interceptor version, the Yak-27V, was converted from the Yak-121 prototype by fitting a 1,300 kg•f (2,866 lb•f) Dushkin S-155 rocket booster in the rear fuselage, and Tumansky RD-9AKYe afterburning turbojets. Although performance was very good, reaching the height of 23,000 m (75,400 ft) during trials, development was halted due to maintenance problems of the Dushkin S-155 rocket engine.

The dedicated high-altitude photo-reconnaissance variant of the Yak-27 interceptor was named Yak-27R (NATO designation &quot;Mangrove&quot;). The radome and radar were replaced with a glazed nose for an observer/navigator, two cameras were added, and the Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon was deleted from the port-board. It had a longer wing with a span of 11.82 m (38 ft 9 in), with two Tumansky RD-9AF turbojet engines and a top speed of about 1,285 km/h (798 mph) at high altitude. It had a service ceiling of 16,500 m (54,000 ft) and a range of 2,380 km (1,480 mi) with two wing tanks. About 180 aircraft were produced in Plant No.292 in Saratov.

==Operational history==
The Yak-27R entered service with the Soviet Air Force in 1960 and was intended to replace the subsonic Ilyushin Il-28 reconnaissance aircraft. However, despite the greater speed and ceiling, it had less range. The Yak-27R also had some operational limitations and was flown at supersonic speed only by the most experienced pilots. The low position of the engines made them prone to foreign object ingestion from unimproved forward-base runways. With the increasing coverage of anti-aircraft missiles over Europe, the high-altitude Yak-27R was often more limited than the Il-28. The Yak-27R was withdrawn from operational service in the early 1970s, and was replaced by the Yak-28R and the MiG-25R.

==Variants==
;Yak-27
:Supersonic interceptor derived from Yak-121, armed with two 30 mm cannons, did not enter service.

;Yak-27F
:Conversion of one Yak-27R with downward pointing TV cameras in the rear fuselage.

<text>Vovinam (short for &quot;Võ Việt Nam&quot;, meaning &quot;Vietnamese Martial Arts&quot;), officially known as Việt Võ Đạo (越武道, meaning &quot;Vietnamese Way of Martial Arts&quot;) is a Vietnamese martial art founded in 1938 by Nguyễn Lộc. It is based on traditional Vietnamese eclectic sources. Vovinam today is considered by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism to be a &quot;National Intangible Cultural Heritage&quot; as of November, 2023.

Vovinam, based on the principle of &quot;hard and soft&quot;, involves the use of strikes, elbows, kicks, knees, and wrestling moves, as well as weapons such as swords, knives, chisels, claws and fans that serve as training devices for reaching optimal control of body and mind. Students also learn defense techniques and forms. Amongst Vietnamese martial arts, Vovinam is the largest and most developed with more than 60 schools around the world, including Poland, Belgium, Canada, Cambodia, Denmark, Germany, the United States, Morocco, Norway, Russia, France, Romania, Switzerland, Sweden, Singapore, Uzbekistan, Thailand, Italy, Australia, India, Pakistan, Iran, Spain, Algeria, Taiwan and Greece, among others.

==History==
Vovinam/Việt Võ Đạo was founded by Nguyễn Lộc (1912 – 1960) in 1938, with the intent of providing practitioners with an efficient method of self-defense after a short period of study. Nguyễn believed martial arts would contribute to freeing Vietnam from colonial rule, which had been ruled by France since 1859, and from outside domination. Vovinam added elements of Chinese and Japanese systems to traditional Vietnamese martial arts, systems, which were thus partially created as a response to the French occupation, meant to promote a sense of national identity for the Vietnamese people. Hence, it is similar to taekwondo in that it is an eclectic system with combined elements of Japanese and Chinese martial arts within an indigenous framework.

After being invited to demonstrate Vovinam publicly in Hanoi with his disciples in 1940, Nguyễn was invited to teach the art at Hanoi&#x27;s École Normale, and Vovinam gained in popularity. During the following years, political unrest increased throughout Vietnam; due to the system&#x27;s nationalist political orientation, the art came under suppression. By 1954, Nguyễn had emigrated to South Vietnam, where he was able to continue to teach and establish Vovinam schools. His discipline was well received and within the year of arriving, he was even invited to train the police in Thủ Đức, Saigon. Unfortunately, he would fall terminally ill that same year and have to delegate all teaching to his senior student Grandmaster Lê Sáng while he relegated himself to backline research &amp; study until he succumbed to his illness four years later. After his death in 1960, Grandmaster Lê Sáng continued the development and international promotion of Vovinam until his own death on September 27, 2010. During the Vietnam War throughout the mid-60&#x27;s under Lê, Vovinam secured teaching opportunities when its instructors were invited to train officers from the National Police. However, a brief rivalry was brewing between Vovinam practitioners and Taekwondo when the South Vietnamese government decided to have the hand-to-hand system utilized by the South Korean military to be the main hand-to-hand system for the South Vietnamese soldiers and have the South Korean troops train the South Vietnamese soldiers. The rivalry was only settled when the Central Military Command later came to an agreement for both Vovinam &amp; Taekwondo as well as Judo to be allowed to be taught to the South Vietnamese military.

The first Vovinam school outside of Vietnam was established in Houston, Texas by Vietnamese emigrants in 1976 after the Fall of Saigon. By 2000, Vovinam schools had been established in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. Vovinam now exists without the political overtones it originally carried.

==Logo==
The Vovinam/Việt Võ Đạo logo is framed in a yellow shield. This shape symbolizes the harmony of hard and soft. Within this yellow shape, the red text &quot;Vovinam&quot; is written above the marine blue text &quot;Việt Võ Đạo&quot;. Beneath the text appears an &quot;Âm-Dương&quot; symbol in red and marine blue. The Âm-Dương is surrounded by a thick, white circle, symbolizing the being of the Dao, with the mission to mediate between negative and positive (&quot;Âm&quot; = Negative, &quot;Dương&quot; = Positive), to subdue the two, to enable life of all beings. A yellow map of Vietnam is superimposed on the symbol.

==Theory==
===Hard and soft===
The yin and yang theory (Vietnamese: &quot;Âm-Dương&quot; and &quot;Nhu-Cương&quot;) states that everything in the universe and on earth is initiated through the interrelation of Âm (negative) and Dương (positive). As to this theory there are martial arts that prefer the hard over the soft and others that prefer the soft over the hard. Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo does not prefer any over the other. Hard and soft are used equally to adapt to every situation, to every problem.

The student aims to develop the ability to combine hard and soft in combat and in daily life. This aims to develop both their physical abilities and spirit.

Not only the principle of the harmony of hard and soft but also many other things resulting from the training contribute to internalizing the martial art philosophy, e.g. fighting spirit, courage, tenacity, fairness, modesty and tolerance. Above all the training in morality and the way of applying the techniques shape the students&#x27; character. Emphasis is placed on recognizing one&#x27;s ego and overcoming it.

In doing so the Vovinam student will gain generosity and tolerance with other people. With the awareness that the most important thing in a human&#x27;s life are other humans, the final goal is to be able to not only help oneself but also to help others to live in peace and harmony with their surroundings.

With the salutation &quot;Iron Hand over benevolent heart&quot;, the student is reminded of the main principle and the goal of Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo with every training. It is also about using the opponent&#x27;s force and reaction, reaching maximum effect with comparatively little force.

===10 principles of Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo===
The term &quot;Việt Võ Đạo&quot; (&quot;the way (Dao) of Viet Vo&quot;) was coined by the patriarch of the second generation of the Vovinam Viet Vo Dao, Lê Sáng, with the objective of adding a philosophical dimension to his martial art. This &quot;Viet Vo Dao&quot; consists of ten principles:

# Vovinam&#x27;s disciples vow to pursue high proficiency in their martial art in order to serve the people and humanity.
# Promise to be faithful to the intentions and teaching of Vovinam and develop the young generation of Vovinam Viêt Võ Dao.
# Be united in spirit and heart, respect one&#x27;s elder, be kind to one&#x27;s peers.
# Respect discipline absolutely, maintain the high standard of personal conduct and honour of a martial art disciple.
# Have respect for other martial art schools, only use martial art skills for self-defense and protect justice.
# Be studious, strengthen the mind, enrich one&#x27;s thought &amp; behavior.
# Live simply, with chastity, loyalty, high principles and ethics.
# Build up a spirit of steely determination and vigor, overcome powers of violence.
# Make intelligent judgments, carry out struggles with perseverance and act with alertness.
# Be self-confident, self-controlled, modest and generous.
(The wording can vary slightly between Vovinam schools)

A &quot;Việt Võ Đạo Federation&quot; was founded on November 3, 1973, in order to reunite some Vietnamese martial arts. Therefore, &quot;Việt Võ Đạo&quot;, in Europe, is also used as a generic term for certain Vietnamese martial arts and philosophies but in Vietnam is only used to refer to &quot;Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo&quot;.

==Belt system, the uniforms and the colors==
===Uniforms===
From 1938 to 1964, there was no official uniform. Following the lifting of the ban on martial arts in Vietnam in 1963, the first Council of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao was gathered in 1964 to codify Vovinam, establishing a rank hierarchy and uniforms and codifying the training curriculum according to rank. The color blue was adopted as the official color for Vovinam uniforms. A separate development of the &quot;Việt Võ Đạo Federation&quot; in 1973 until 1990 the uniforms&#x27; color was black.

In the summer of 1990, Vovinam masters from around the world met at the International Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao Conference in California with the goal of creating a structured organization for Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo outside Vietnam (the International Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao Federation). One of the decisions was that the suit in Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo were now to be blue worldwide.

===Belts===
The student begins with a cyan belt - the same color as his/her suit.

 Blue stands for the factor of the sea, and the hope - the hope in being successful in learning Vovinam. With the following 3 exams, yellow stripes are added to the blue belt. The 3rd yellow stripe is followed by the yellow belt.

 Yellow stands for earth. In other martial arts this belt is black. Therefore, a Vovinam student who carries a yellow belt is allowed to carry a black belt. This makes a comparison to other martial arts easier, e.g. in public performances. A person who wears a yellow belt with one or more red stripes is considered an instructor.

Following in a longer period of time, respectively 3 red stripes are added to the yellow belt. This corresponds to the 1st, 2nd, respectively 3rd degree blackbelt (Đẳng). The exam following the 3rd red stripe is the master&#x27;s exam. Passing the exam successfully assigns the right to wear a red belt with a circulating yellow border (4th degree blackbelt).

 Red stands for the blood and the intensive flame. The student has internalized Vovinam (Việt Võ Đạo) even further. The 5th to 10th degree blackbelt are shown as a completed red belt with 1 to 6 white stripes.

 White stands for the infiniteness, the bones; is the symbol of the depth of the spirit. The white belt assigns the master the absolute mastery of Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo. On the white belt thin, lengthwise stripes in blue, black, yellow and red symbolize the whole of Vovinam (Việt Võ Đạo) again. This belt is reserved for the &quot;Chưởng Môn&quot;.

Now, Vovinam has two different sets of belt ranking because of the different training program: The WVVF Vovinam (headquarter: Vietnam) uses the traditional program and (headquarter: France) uses the new training program.

===Name plates===
 With every change of belt color the name plate color changes. Blue belt students start off with yellow text on blue name plates. With the yellow belt the name plate changes to red text on yellow ground. The red belt comes along with white text on a red name plate. The patriarch carries red text on a white name plate. Thin, colored lines in blue, yellow and red are shown on the upper and lower borders of this white name plate.

==Specialties==
Vovinam has some specialised techniques:
# Đòn Chân Tấn Công

<doc id="1047654" wikidata="Q5436678" url="?curid=1047654" title="Fascism (book)">
<text>Fascism is a book edited by political theorist Roger Griffin. It was published by Oxford University Press in 1995 as a 410-page paperback. It is a reader in the Oxford Readers series, which assembles the writings of various authors on the topic of fascism and the far-right. It serves as an English-language source book to introduce readers to pre-fascist anti-liberalism, interwar fascism in Italy and Germany, as well as associated international variants of fascism from Argentina to Japan.

==Description==
Griffin attempts a comprehensive survey of the illiberal right-wing throughout the 20th century, including topics as diverse as radical ecologism, neo-paganism, ultra-nationalism, and fanatical racism. Authors include an eclectic mix of philosophers, politicians, poets, agitators, and social critics, ranging from the fairly benign pessimistic poet-scholars of Weimar Germany (such as Stefan George, Ernst Jünger, and Martin Heidegger) to the rhetoric of those such as Heinrich Himmler and the American white supremacist, William Pierce. Griffin principally examines interwar Italian Fascism and German Nazism, with political and historiographical analysis by contemporary and post-war liberals, Marxists, and conservatives.

There are 214 selections in the book, most of them from pre-1945. About half of them are from Italy and Germany, plus a section on &quot;abortive fascisms&quot; with writings from Britain, Spain, France and numerous other countries in Europe, Africa and South America. A section is devoted to &quot;theories of fascism,&quot; and the book concludes with a collation of post-war writings.

<text>The Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national football team represents Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in men&#x27;s international football. It is controlled by the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Football Federation.

The team finished second in the Caribbean Cup in 1995, and participated at the 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Its first FIFA World Cup qualification attempt was for the 1994 edition, and it has entered every World Cup qualification since.

==History==

===1936–1995===
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines played their first two international matches, against their neighbour Barbados in 1936 - both matches ending in a 1–1 draw. In the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, they played several editions of the Windward Islands Tournament, winning the 1965 and 1966 competitions. They also participated in the 1979, qualifying to the final stage and finishing in second place behind Haiti. In the following edition, in 1981, they reached the final stage but again finished in second, this time two points off of Trinidad and Tobago.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines qualified for the inaugural 1989 Caribbean Cup, finishing top of their qualification group including a 9–0 victory over Sint Maarten. In the finals, they would fail to get out of the group, finishing bottom behind Grenada and Netherlands Antilles. They would reach the final phase of the Caribbean Cup again in consecutive years, 1992 and 1993, without much luck, finishing last and second last respectively.

At the end of 1992, the &quot;Vincy Heat&quot; participated in their first World Cup qualifiers. They got through the first rounds, eliminating Saint Lucia (3–2 on aggregate) and Suriname (2–1 on aggregate), to advance to the second phase, where they finished bottom of the group, with six losses in as many games. Especially painful was the 11–0 defeat that Mexico dealt them at the Azteca Stadium, the worst in their history.

===1996 Gold Cup===
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines qualified for the 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup, by obtaining the runner-up position in the 1995 Caribbean Cup. During qualification for the Caribbean Cup, &quot;Vincy Heat&quot; had dispatched Montserrat 20–0 over two legs. They had gone on to finish top of their group in the main competition and defeated Cuba in the semi-finals 3–2, however Trinidad and Tobago proved too strong in the final and won 5–0. In the 1996 Gold Cup, the &quot;Vincy Heat&quot; failed to register a victory, losing 5–0 to Mexico and 3–0 to Guatemala.

===1996–present=== 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would qualify again for the 1996 Caribbean Cup but this time finish bottom of their group. It would be eleven years before they qualified again, on goals scored, following their 8–0 thrashing of Saint Lucia with five goals from Shandel Samuel which saw them edge out Jamaica. In the 2007 tournament, &quot;Vincy Heat&quot; only managed one win, against Guyana 2–0, and finished bottom of their group again.

In 1998 World Cup qualifiers, the Saint Vincentian team beat Puerto Rico 9–1 over two legs, then defeated Saint Kitts and Nevis on away goals, thanks to a 2–2 draw in Basseterre. In the third round of qualifying they finished with six defeats in six games, including an 11–3 loss to Honduras. In the 2002 qualifiers, they beat the U.S. Virgin Islands 14–1 on aggregate, Saint Kitts and Nevis (4-2) and Antigua and Barbuda (5–2) but again finished without a win in the qualification semi-finals.

They improved in the 2006 qualifiers beating Nicaragua to advance to the third round for the third consecutive time, and obtaining two victories over Saint Kitts and Nevis, finishing in third place. However, in the 2010 qualifiers, they were eliminated for the first time in the second qualifying round, at the hands of Canada, who prevailed with an aggregate score of 7–1. In 2014 qualification, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines won once against Grenada to finish 13 points behind Guatemala. In 2018 World Cup qualification, they managed to beat Guyana 6–6 on away goals, then beat Aruba 3–2 to make it to the fourth round group stage. There they failed to get a single point, conceding 34 goals and finishing bottom of their group, including a 9–3 loss to Guatemala.

<text>No. 8 Group RAF (8 Gp) was a Royal Air Force group which existed during the final year of the First World War and during the Second World War.

==First World War==
No. 8 Group was formed in April 1918 as a training unit and designated 8 Group (Training). It remained in this function throughout the rest of the war and was disbanded in May 1919.

==Second World War==
===First formation===
The Group was re-established as No 8 (Bomber) Group on 1 September 1941 only to be disbanded around five months later on 28 January 1942.

===Reformation of Group 8===
8 Group was re-constituted when Bomber Command&#x27;s Pathfinder Force was renamed No. 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group on 8 January 1943. The group consisted of specialist squadrons that marked targets for the main attacks of Bomber Command aircraft. The Force, which had been formed in August 1942 with five squadrons from the existing Bomber Command Groups, flew a mix of Short Stirling, Handley Page Halifax, and Avro Lancaster, all four-engined heavy bomber aircraft, along with Vickers Wellington, a twin-engined, long-range medium bomber aircraft. When new aircraft, such as the de Havilland Mosquito, a twin-engined, multirole combat aircraft became available, 8 Group got the first ones. Its aircraft used navigation aids such as Gee, H2S and Oboe to find the targets of attack more accurately than the main force on its own could. Initially formed of five squadrons, 8 Group ultimately grew to a strength of 19 squadrons. 

No. 8 Group was also responsible for the Light Night Striking Force, equipped with Mosquito bombers and used for harassing raids on Germany. It was disbanded on 15 December 1945, though its badge and motto (&quot;We Guide to Strike&quot;) were subsequently authorized on 11 March 1953. While the majority of Pathfinder squadrons and personnel were from the Royal Air Force, the group also included many from the air forces of other Commonwealth countries. The PFF flew a total of 50,490 individual sorties against some 3,440 targets. The cost in human lives was grievous. At least 3,727 members were killed on operations and 675 aircraft lost.

<text>Cele Goldsmith Lalli (1933 – January 14, 2002) was an American editor. She was the editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; from 1959 to 1965, &quot;Fantastic&quot; from 1958 to 1965, and later the Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Modern Bride&quot; magazine.

==Biography==
Goldsmith joined the science fiction/fantasy field in 1955, working as Howard Browne&#x27;s secretary and assistant (and particularly on the short-lived magazine &quot;Pen Pals&quot;), and, after Browne resigned, with his successor Paul W. Fairman. When Fairman left Ziff-Davis in 1958, Goldsmith took over as editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;. Goldsmith was open to new authors and experimentation in writing, with the result that between 1961 and 1964 &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; were &quot;the two most exciting and original magazines&quot; in the SF and fantasy fields.

Among her discoveries were Thomas M. Disch, Ursula K. Le Guin, Keith Laumer, Sonya Dorman (as a fiction writer), Larry Eisenberg, and Roger Zelazny. She was also instrumental in bringing Fritz Leiber out of an early writer&#x27;s-block-induced retirement (a 1959 issue was devoted entirely to his fiction), and was among the first US editors to publish British author J. G. Ballard.

Goldsmith married in 1964 and took Lalli as her last name. By this time, she&#x27;d received a special award from the World Science Fiction Convention for her work on the magazines. Le Guin and subsequent &quot;Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot; editors Barry N. Malzberg and Ted White have taken care to note the significance of her achievement.

In 1965, Ziff-Davis sold the two fiction magazines to publisher Sol Cohen, who founded Ultimate Publications to publish them. Lalli continued at Ziff-Davis, where she worked at &quot;Modern Bride&quot; magazine for 30 years.

===Death===
Not long after her retirement, she was killed in a car accident in Newtown, Connecticut, on January 14, 2002.

<text>Future Pigeon is an American punk/dub band from Los Angeles, California, contemporary to the late 1990s and early 2000s. The band is composed of Eddie Rucha on bass, Brandon Wells on percussion, Lindsey Glover on drums, Jason Mason on skank guitar, Jeremy Carins on fiddle, Jeff Carins on electric guitar, Danny Preston on keyboards, Slim on trumpet and Liam Philpot on sax.

==History==
Future Pigeon are an award-winning underground band from LA; they are often associated in performances with other more famous members of that scene such as the late Elliott Smith, Smokey Hormel, Hank Williams III, and others. For example, Future Pigeon performed at Elliott Smith&#x27;s memorial concert. Future Pigeon also performed a dub version of Elliott Smith&#x27;s &quot;Waltz No. 2 (XO)&quot; for the short film/documentary &quot;Strange Parallel&quot;.

Future Pigeon are also featured in the movie Southlander (which also features Elliott Smith, in a small role as a bus driver). The semi-fictional Future Pigeon of that film includes Beth Orton (&quot;Rocket&quot;) as lead vocalist.

The song &quot;&quot;Evil&quot; appeared in an episode of Weeds in September 2007. After the episode, the song appeared on the iTunes most downloaded list. Keyboardist, Danny Preston is now performing as Rainbow Arabia with his wife, Tiffany.

Also their song &quot;Gift Tax&quot;&quot; has appeared on the video game Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground.

<doc id="1047694" wikidata="Q3149543" url="?curid=1047694" title="Solidarity tax on wealth">
<text>The solidarity tax on wealth (, ISF) was an annual direct wealth tax on those in France having assets in excess of €1,300,000 (since 2011). It was one of the Socialist Party&#x27;s 1981 electoral platform&#x27;s measures, 110 Propositions for France. First named IGF (&quot;Impôt sur les Grandes Fortunes&quot;), it was abolished in 1986 by Jacques Chirac&#x27;s right-wing government, but reestablished in 1988 as ISF in slightly different terms after François Mitterrand&#x27;s reelection.

In September 2017, the French Government abolished ISF and replaced it with the (IFI), from 2018.

==Scope==
The calculation applied to tax declarers, meaning that it could apply to a grouping of two individuals: married couples, cohabiting couples, or couples with a PACS. All global assets were taken into account for French residents; for others, the tax was based on assets that reside in France, with the exception of financial ones.

The ISF was controversial; critics claimed it drove away wealthy individuals from the country, resulting in financial loss. A report by senator Philippe Marini estimated that 843 people left France in 2006 because of the tax, resulting in a net loss of €2.8 billion.

==Basis==
In principle all assets were taken into account except for the following:

* professional goods such as enterprises (depending on the percentage owned),
* vintage (more than one century old) and collection objects,
* artistic, literature, or industrial rights,
* woods and participation in forestry plantations (for 75% of their value),
* anonymous bonds,
* capital value of pensions and retirement plans,
* capital obtained as compensation for physical injury in accidents or due to illness.

==Revenue==
ISF brought in €4.42 billion in 2007, 19% more than in 2006. It constitutes 1.5% of France&#x27;s total tax receipts.

Half of all households who pay ISF make an annual contribution of less than €2,000.

==Rules to fix the net taxable value==
ISF was levied on what remained of the gross value after subtracting deductible debts. The gross value was determined by the declarer following certain rules. For example, the value of the principal home was reduced by 30%, as was done for some rental income. Certain real estate properties in countries with a fiscal convention such as Denmark, Luxembourg, Egypt, Finland, Netherlands, and Czech Republic were excluded. The furniture in the home could not exceed 5% of the total value of the other goods.

Following President Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s tax law of 2007, ISF was adjusted so that the sum of all taxes due in France would not exceed 50% of the annual revenues. He overturned this in 2011, at the same time as lowering the rates of the ISF.

==Rates==



After calculation, a deduction was granted for minors or any disabled persons living in the same household.

<text>A dragon&#x27;s egg is a fireworks pyrotechnic star which first burns for a period for a visual effect and then loudly deflagrates. This effect became controversial because of the toxic compounds once used, particularly lead tetroxide (Pb3O4). 

Bismuth trioxide or bismuth subcarbonate are commonly used as more environmentally friendly substitutes for lead compounds to achieve the effect, and its occurrence in fireworks displays has since become much more common.

Because of how heavy an individual bismuth atom is, a shell or cake containing mainly dragon&#x27;s eggs (and therefore enriched in bismuth) is often noticeably heavier than a similar device containing other effects.

== History ==
The dragon&#x27;s egg firework was creating in the late 20th century, compared to other fireworks that date back to ancient China. The original design was made with lead tetroxide. This chemical is very sensitive both to friction and impact. This makes the compound highly explosive. Lead tetroxide also is extremely toxic and can have some serious health effects. If lead tetroxide is inhaled, it can make it hard to breath, and cause chest pain. If ingested, it can lead to lead poisoning, neurological damage, and in extreme cases even death.

Once the effects of lead tetroxide were discovered, the dragon&#x27;s egg firework was then created using bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3). Bismuth trioxide is commonly used as a non-toxic substitute to lead compounds in pyrotechnics.

<text>A medieval pageant is a form of procession traditionally associated with both secular and religious rituals, often with a narrative structure. Pageantry was an important aspect of medieval European seasonal festivals, in particular around the celebration of Corpus Christi, which began after the thirteenth century. This festival reenacted the entire history of the world, in processional performance, from Bible&#x27;s Genesis to the Apocalypse, employing hundreds of performers and mobile scenic elements. Plays were performed on mobile stages, called waggons, that traveled through towns so plays could be watched consecutively. Each waggon was sponsored by a guild who wrote, designed, and acted in the plays.

==20th century revival==
The form was revived in the early 20th century by the English dramatist Louis N. Parker, who staged the Sherbourne Pageant in 1905, followed by the Warwick Pageant in 1906. The success of these productions led to a proliferation of pageant plays in England in the following decades. Modern pageants depicted not just religious stories and themes, but rural life and local history as well. Notable authors of modern pageant plays include E. M. Forster and T. S. Eliot.

Other pageants in the Christian world have centered on Saints&#x27; festivals, Carnival (Mardi Gras), and Easter, while vernacular agrarian festivals have celebrated seasonal events such as the harvest, and the Summer and Winter solstices.

Also drawing on the medieval tradition, contemporary artists such as Bread and Puppet Theater, the Welfare State, In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre, Spiral Q, and Superior Concept Monsters have used pageants as a potent community-based performance form.

==Notable examples==
The processional giants and dragons () of Belgium and France are a set of folkloric manifestations which have been inscribed by UNESCO on the lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008, originally proclaimed in November 2005. They include:

In Belgium:
* Ducasse d&#x27;Ath
* Ducasse de Mons
* Meyboom of Brussels
* Ommegang van Dendermonde
* Ommegang van Mechelen

In France:
* Cassel: Reuze Papa and Reuze Maman
* Douai: Gayant, Marie Cagenon, Fillon, Jacquot, Binbin
* Pézenas: le Poulain
* Tarascon: la Tarasque

<text>The Barbados national football team, nicknamed &quot;Bajan Tridents&quot;, is the national football team of Barbados, and is controlled by the Barbados Football Association. It has never qualified for a major international tournament. It came close to qualifying for the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup as it hosted the Caribbean Cup finals that acted as Gold Cup qualifiers, but finished fourth of the four teams. In 2001, it surprised many by making the semi-final round of the 2002 World Cup Qualifiers. In the first game of this round, they pulled off a shock 2–1 win over Costa Rica, but lost their five remaining games. In 2004, Barbados gained a shock 1–1 draw at home to Northern Ireland.

==History==

===Beginnings (1929–1980)===
Barbados played their first international match on April 20, 1929, against Trinidad and Tobago, ending in a 3–0 victory. In the 1930s, they participated in several editions of the Martínez Shield where they suffered their most severe defeat against Guyana (at that time, British Guiana), in Georgetown, in 1931, 9–0.

Barbados had to wait for the qualifying tournament for the 1972 Munich Olympic Games to play its first official competition match against the amateur team of El Salvador, on July 25, 1971, in Bridgetown, a match that saw the Selecta win 0–3. Two years later, Barbados participated in the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games, in Santo Domingo, although it did not qualify past the first round. On August 15, 1976, Barbados defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2–1 (a brace by Victor Clarke) in the 1978 World Cup qualifiers, which doubled as qualification for the 1977 CONCACAF Championship. In the second leg, the &quot;Soca Warriors&quot; claimed their revenge (1–0) in Port of Spain, taking the tie to a third tiebreaker game, played in Bridgetown, on September 14, 1976, where Trinidad and Tobago won 1–3, eliminating Barbados.

===1980–2000===
In the &#x27;80s, the &quot;Bajan Braves&quot; obtained 2nd place in the 1985 CFU Championship. The following year they played the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games, where they reached the quarterfinals, before being eliminated by the hosts, Dominican Republic. At the end of the decade, Barbados hosted the first edition of the Caribbean Cup, without being able to progress beyond the group stage.

In the 90s, Barbados would return to the World Cup qualifiers, in the preliminary tournament for the 1994 World Cup, where it was again eliminated by Trinidad and Tobago (5–1). In the 1998 World Cup qualifiers, after beating Dominica with an aggregate score of 2–0, Barbados was beaten down by Jamaica (0–1 in Bridgetown and 2–0 in Kingston). In the Caribbean Cup, the Bajan Braves qualified for the 1994 competition (eliminated in the first round) but subsequently failed to qualify for the annual competition from 1995 to 1999.

===2000s===
The 21st century started well for Barbados, who eliminated Cuba on penalties (5–4), after two 1–1 draws in Havana and Bridgetown, during the qualifying rounds for the 2002 World Cup. In the second round, they achieved a historic victory at home against Costa Rica (2–1), on July 16, 2000, with goals from Llewellyn Riley and Michael Forde. However, after winning that match, the Barbadians lost the remaining fixtures, wasting their chance to advance to the final hexagonal.

They would return in 2001 to the final phase of the Caribbean Cup, although without much luck after being eliminated again in the first round. In the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, the Saint Kitts and Nevis team eliminated Barbados in the first phase, with an aggregate score of 5–2. In 2005, Barbados hosted (for the second time) the XII edition of the Caribbean Cup, finishing in 4th place. They also qualified for the 2007 and 2008 tournaments, eliminated both times in the group stage. In the preliminary tournament for the 2010 World Cup, Barbados was eliminated by the United States, over two legs, with a crushing aggregate result of 9–0.

===2010–present===
The qualifiers heading to the 2014 World Cup were a real ordeal for the &quot;Bajan Braves&quot; who were placed into a group with Bermuda, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. They finished last in the group, with 2 goals scored and 14 conceded. After being eliminated in the preliminary phase of the Caribbean Cup in 2012 and after 17 months of inactivity, Barbados returned to play an international match, on March 2, 2014, against Jamaica, in Bridgetown, a match that concluded with victory for the &quot;Reggae Boyz&quot;, 2–0.

In the qualifying rounds for the 2018 World Cup, they would face the US Virgin Islands where they were surprised 0–1 at home, however, Barbados would overcome the deficit by a 0–4 victory on the road. Then they would face Aruba, winning 0–2 as a visitor, then beating them 1–0 at home however Barbados had fielded an ineligible player, Hadan Holligan, who was due to serve a suspension for collecting two yellow cards, therefore the second leg was awarded to Aruba 3–0, seeing them progress, eliminating Barbados.

<text>The Big Boss (; originally titled as Fists of Fury in the United States) is a 1971 Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Lo Wei (who also wrote the film) and Wu Chi-hsiang. Bruce Lee stars in his first major film in a lead role, and his first Hong Kong film since 1960. The film co-stars Maria Yi, James Tien, Tony Liu, and Nora Miao. Originally written for Tien, the leading role was given to Lee instead when the film&#x27;s original director, Ng Kar-seung, was replaced by Lo Wei. The film was a critical success and excelled at the box office. Lee&#x27;s strong performance overshadowed Tien, already a star in Hong Kong, and made Bruce Lee famous in Asia and eventually the world.

The film went on to gross nearly worldwide (equivalent to approximately adjusted for inflation), against a tight budget of $100,000, approximately times its original investment. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film up until Lee&#x27;s next film, &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (1972).

==Plot==
Cheng Chao-an is a Chinese mainlander who moves to Pak Chong, Thailand to live with his extended family and to work in an ice factory. He accidentally meets his cousin Hsu Chien when Hsu stands up to local street thugs when they beat his kid brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to. He swore to his mother never to participate in any fighting and wears a jade amulet around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge. Cheng begins his work at the factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powder — obviously illegal drugs — falls out. Two of Cheng&#x27;s cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. 

The factory is a front for a drug smuggling ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng&#x27;s cousins (Wang and Chang) refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby preserving the secret. Hsu Chien and Ah Pi, another of Cheng&#x27;s cousins, go to Hsiao Mi&#x27;s mansion to find out what happened to the two men. Hsu doubts Hsiao&#x27;s claims that he knows nothing and threatens to go to the authorities. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are also killed. When the Chinese workers at the factory learn that Hsu and Ah Pi are missing, they refuse to work and start a riot against the Thai management, who are joined by a group of hired thugs. 

During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng&#x27;s amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some thugs, causing them to flee. To reduce tensions, the factory manager makes Cheng a foreman, inviting him to a dinner that night to meet the boss. Everyone is happy that Cheng is the new foreman. The family goes home, and everyone is satisfied except Chow Mei who starts crying because the others have forgotten about the missing men. Cheng promises to find out what he can about them. Cheng goes to the factory and gets the men back to work. He tells the workers that he will speak to the boss and go to the police to find out what he can. 

Cheng arrives at the dinner. The manager tells him that the boss cannot make it due to a meeting with visitors from out of town. Several women arrive at the dinner table, sit next to Cheng, and fill their glasses with cognac. Cheng gets drunk and spends the night with Sun Wu Man, a prostitute who attended the dinner. Chow Mei is walking by as he leaves the brothel in the morning. Cheng is embarrassed. 

Because Cheng attended the dinner and got drunk, he did not follow up on his promise to speak to the police about the missing men. He tells his family when he returns home that he forgot. This causes much unease for Cheng&#x27;s family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time revelling in his new position and having dinner with the boss than helping to look for their brothers. They resent him, except Chow Mei, who stands up for him. 

Later, Sun Wu Man warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao&#x27;s son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and murders Sun. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien in the ice blocks. Cheng is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and his gang in the process. He returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chow Mei is missing. Mourning his loss by a river, Cheng vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if he dies. 

Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi&#x27;s mansion to fight him and his men. One of Hsiao Mi&#x27;s disgruntled slaves frees Chow Mei, who was being held hostage in a cramped room used as a prison cell. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight by deflecting the knife Mi throws at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chow Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. He is detained and taken to the police vehicle to leave the mansion.

==Background and conception==
The four years following the cancellation of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; were a difficult and frustrating time for Bruce Lee. In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting. Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;), and production on &quot;The Silent Flute&quot; had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.

In spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son Brandon. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular HKTVB chat show &quot;Enjoy Yourself Tonight&quot;, where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.

Encouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend Unicorn Chan to pass on his CV to Shaw Brothers, Hong Kong&#x27;s largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from Raymond Chow, a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest. Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce&#x27;s interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.

In June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers, Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for &quot;The Big Boss&quot; and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively titled &quot;King of Chinese Boxers&quot; and which became &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;). This eased the Lees&#x27; financial worries and permitted Linda to quit her job.

With the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. They knew that Shaw Brothers were making a Muay Thai boxing film in Thailand (&quot;Duel of Fists&quot;), and wanted to make their new film there, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.

==Production==
===Writing===
Veteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on Cheng Chi-Yong, a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao&#x27;an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong&#x27;s ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.

It was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and &quot;The Big Boss&quot; was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce&#x27;s knowledge. Lo later recalled, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day&#x27;s filming.&quot;

===Filming===
Bruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls. Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time. Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong, a small town situated some northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the Khao Yai National Park, Thailand&#x27;s oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast (Isan) of Thailand from the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Pak Chong would be Bruce&#x27;s home for about four weeks, and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were everywhere, and the tap water in the hotel was yellow. Bruce asked the hotel staff to put his mattress on the floor, as sleeping on the bed was uncomfortable due to his ongoing back problem. He also needed lots of rest after a fight scene.

When Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.

Shooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the &quot;uncertain&quot; original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua). Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as a &quot;fame lover&quot; and &quot;another so-so one with an almost unbearable air of superiority&quot;. Bruce badly cut his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.

One night, filming of the big fight in the ice house had to be stopped for an hour as Bruce had lost a contact lens, and dozens of people were on their hands and knees looking for it amongst thousands of ice chips. Eventually Bruce found it himself, leading Lo Wei to wonder if he had it in his pocket all along, and was deliberately being disruptive.

Aside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the Mun River), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby New Wan Chai Hotel (now the Rimtarninn), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.

Perhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss&#x27;s mansion and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963. Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.

There has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, as depicted in the 1993 biopic &quot;&quot;. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former Muay Thai bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks &quot;telegraphed&quot;, while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother ) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.

After an eventful, and at times chaotic, first few days&#x27; filming in Pak Chong, by early August the filming had picked up speed and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei&#x27;s ideas of filming risqué scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character&#x27;s newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.

The final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climactic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured &quot;two days of hell&quot; when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with, and contributed to, his character&#x27;s worn out, exhausted appearance.

The cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong. The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel. A few scenes were filmed at the Chao Phraya River in Phra Pradaeng District, including the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao&#x27;s scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong. At times filming was delayed by heavy rain.

&quot;The Big Boss&quot; film crew returned to Hong Kong on 3 September, where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the &quot;leg-grappling&quot; scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club). The final scene filmed was the now deleted &quot;pushcart attack&quot; in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.

===Post-production===
Bruce viewed over three hours of unedited footage on 5 September, and was pleased with the results. The next day, he flew to the U.S. to see his family and film further episodes of &quot;Longstreet&quot;. While Bruce was in the US, the footage was sent for processing and editing. The editing was initially done by Golden Harvest editor Sung Ming, but because they were behind schedule, the renowned award-winning editor Chiang Hsing-Lung was also brought in to help. A veteran of over 170 movies, Chiang worked very quickly, and helped deliver the film on time. Since he was employed by Shaw Bros at the time, his involvement was kept secret, and he was uncredited.

Bruce returned to Hong Kong on 16 October with his family plus friend Robert Baker. They were greeted at Kai Tak Airport by several friends, news reporters and a large group of scouts from the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The next day, a private screening was held at Golden Harvest for cinema owners. Sung Ming then made further edits to appease the Hong Kong censors, for the film&#x27;s general release at the end of October. On 22 October, Bruce and Robert Baker appeared on &quot;Enjoy Yourself Tonight&quot; to promote the film.

===Bruce Lee and JKD short film===
While in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called &quot;Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do&quot;, which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Gold Cyclone Whirlwind&quot;), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee&#x27;s skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of &quot;The Big Boss&quot;. Nora, who was already in Thailand on vacation, joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971, but the short film was not made, presumably because there was not enough time; she did, however, film a few brief scenes for &quot;The Big Boss&quot; in a cameo role as a roadside refreshment vendor.

==Release==
===Box office===
On 23 October 1971, the film premiered at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in Hong Kong&#x27;s Central district for a now legendary midnight screening. Linda recalled: &quot;Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.&quot; The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach , and a week to reach . By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), &quot;The Big Boss&quot; had made , breaking the previous record held by &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; by more than HK$800,000. An estimated people in Hong Kong, out of a population of four million, had paid to watch the film. It became the highest-grossing film of all time in Hong Kong until Lee&#x27;s second film, &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, was released in March 1972.

Shortly after the Hong Kong run, &quot;The Big Boss&quot; was released in Singapore, and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay&#x27;s Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes. It went on general release on 8 December, and by the end of its run on 21 January 1972, it had broken box office records with just over , about S$240,000 more than previous record-holder &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. The film also played to packed cinemas in Malaysia, the third territory to show the film. By September 1972, it had grossed in the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur. During its initial run, the film grossed more than in Southeast Asia alone and across Asia.

Despite the enormous success of &quot;The Big Boss&quot; in the Far East, overseas distributors were initially reluctant as they did not think it had potential outside Southeast Asia. It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in Beirut (Lebanon) in 1972 that they began to take notice. Suddenly buyers from all over the world were arriving in Hong Kong to buy the film, which was soon opening in new markets for Chinese films such as South America, Africa and southern Europe. The film became a major box office hit in Europe between 1972 and early 1973. In the UK, however, the release of the English-dubbed version was delayed as distributors Crest Films withdrew their application for a BBFC certificate, while they waited for the current storm surrounding film censorship in Britain to pass (the Mandarin version was shown in Chinese cinema clubs in Britain in June 1972).

There was also a delay in the US, as distributors National General Pictures disliked the dubbing, and spent a lot of money on a new soundtrack featuring new music and rewritten, redubbed English dialogue. This new version was eventually released in the U.S. in April 1973 with the title &quot;Fists of Fury&quot;, about 18 months after the Hong Kong premiere and after &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (retitled &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot; in the US), Lee&#x27;s second major role, had a limited run in New York. It was an instant hit, with opening day earnings of from 53 theaters in the New Jersey and New York areas. It topped the North American box office in May 1973, above two other Hong Kong martial arts films in the second and third spots, &quot;Lady Whirlwind&quot; (&quot;Deep Thrust&quot;) and &quot;King Boxer&quot; (&quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot;). Its success was surprising given that the film was only originally intended for the Mandarin circuit. The film earned in distributor rentals at the American and Canadian box office during its initial run in 1973. &quot;The Big Boss&quot; went on to gross a total revenue of in the United States (equivalent to adjusted for inflation in 2020), where it sold approximately tickets and was one of the top 20 films released in 1973.

In France, the film became one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1973, with 2,519,063 ticket sales. In Spain, the film sold 2,211,383 tickets. Upon its October 1973 release in South Korea, the film sold 209,551 tickets in the capital city of Seoul. In Lebanon, the film had a packed six-week first run in Beirut and then a second run that outperformed &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). The UK and Japan were among the last countries to release the film, in April 1974. In Japan, it was the year&#x27;s seventh-highest-grossing film, with in distributor rental earnings.

Against a tight budget of , the film grossed nearly worldwide (equivalent to approximately adjusted for inflation), earning nearly times its budget.

===Re-releases===
When the film was released in the United States, the death of Hsiao Mi, &quot;The Boss&quot;, was cut down to him simply being stabbed in the chest with a knife in order to receive an &quot;R&quot; rating. The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an&#x27;s fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an &quot;X&quot; rating. The first time this scene was shown in the U.S. was when it played on cable channel AMC in July 2004.

Columbia Pictures released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. Miramax distributed &quot;The Big Boss&quot; on television &amp; streaming (Hulu &amp; Netflix) along with &quot;Bruce Lee, the Legend&quot; (1984), &quot;Game of Death&quot;, &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 300,000 viewers on Channel 5 in 2008, making it the year&#x27;s most-watched foreign-language film on Channel 5.

On July 14, 2020, The Criterion Collection released a Blu-ray box set featuring &quot;The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Way of the Dragon, Enter the Dragon, Game of Death,&quot; and &quot;Game of Death II&quot; titled &quot;Bruce Lee: His Greatest Hits.&quot;

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Big Boss&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon release. The &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; during the film&#x27;s original Hong Kong run said that &quot;This is probably the biggest thing to hit the Mandarin film business since the invention of fake blood ... Every cinema showing this film is packed to the fire exits.&quot; In a positive review for Singapore newspaper &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, Arthur Richards wrote, &quot;It is a delightful study of Chinese martial arts mixed with karate and lightning kicks, Western-style ... An acceptable thriller of the James Bond calibre.&quot;
Conversely, a negative review by Edgar Koh had appeared in another Singapore newspaper, New Nation, a few days earlier: &quot;Bruce Lee is certainly skilled in his job, not as an actor but as an exponent of his particular brand of fighting with fists and legs ... There are the stereotype good and bad, and the by now redundant theme of revenge. On top of this, it doesn&#x27;t flow smoothly; the emotional mood, shallow though it is, is sometimes left out on a limb.&quot;

Reviews were also mixed when the film was released (as &quot;Fists of Fury&quot;) in the U.S. in spring 1973. J. Oliver Prescott of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Bruce Lee is the fastest foot in the East ... Now back in Hong Kong, he has become the hottest international movie star since Clint Eastwood. Unlike Eastwood&#x27;s anti-hero, Bruce Lee is giving the American audiences what they apparently want now: a hero. Lee is Rex Allen, Lash Larue, Tom Mix, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry all rolled into one ... The characters are certainly simple: these are just plain Chinese country folk whose little disagreements develop overnight into Oriental rumbles equivalent to the Sharks and Jets in West Side Story.&quot;
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Kung fu movies began as a local phenomenon in Hong Kong a couple of years ago. The two I&#x27;ve just seen, &quot;Fists of Fury&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Big Boss&quot;) and &quot;Deep Thrust&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Lady Whirlwind&quot;), make the worst Italian Westerns look like the most solemn and noble achievements of the early Soviet cinema.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;Despite the silly plot, dreadful supporting cast and prim morality (or perhaps because of them), &quot;Fists of Fury&quot; is sometimes entertaining, with most of the credit due to Lee.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 65% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10.

==Alternative versions==
===Censorship and missing scenes===
&quot;The Big Boss&quot; has a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons and for different markets. A few shots of excessive violence and bloodshed (including the notorious &quot;saw in the head&quot; kill) and a sex scene were cut by the Hong Kong censors before the film was released, and haven&#x27;t been seen since.

Numerous further scenes were cut for all prints released outside of Hong Kong, mainly to increase the pacing of the film, as follows:

* The scene at the refreshments stall is shortened, including an extended fight between Hsu Chien (James Tien) and the thugs.
* An entire scene in which some of the cousins play a game of Chinese chess, only for Ah Kun (Li Kun) to complain about cheating; also some of Cheng Chao An&#x27;s (Bruce Lee) arrival at the house.
* Cheng and Hsu are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid two carts which are hurled towards them. The pair return home, with Cheng looking amused as Hsu describes the fight to the family.
* A scene in which Cheng, after seeing his uncle off, heads down a road and observes the drink stand seller smiling at him from her stall; he walks past her looking glum.
* As the thugs dispose of the two cousins at the ice house, a severed head is thrown into an ice container.
* Some shots of Hsiao Chiun (Tony Liu) and then his father demonstrating fighting tactics to their men.
* Some shots of Hsu and Hsiao Chiun after the former is stabbed in the head.
* Some shots of the thugs approaching and entering the grounds of the family home.
* The shot of Cheng lifting the net to reveal Ah San&#x27;s body is shortened.
* The scene of Cheng at the riverside is shortened to remove some of his inner monologue and shots of his cousins&#x27; murdered bodies. After standing up and throwing his bundle of belongings into the river, the parts of him angrily shaking his fist and repeatedly shouting &quot;Revenge!&quot; are removed.
* After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the big boss&#x27;s mansion as in the usual versions, he returns to the brothel for a third time. Here, he picks the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). They go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands behind the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown tucking in his shirt, while the woman remains in bed, staring at him. He hands all his money to her, even though he already paid. He then picks up a bag of prawn crackers from the bedside table, tries one, and then leaves.
* Cheng punches Hsiao Mi one more time as he lies lifeless.

In December 1979, a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, was organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine; a Mandarin print from Golden Harvest&#x27;s London office was screened for over 1,700 fans and was complete with the exception of a few shots cut by the Hong Kong censors. In 2023, Arrow Films announced the release of a set titled Bruce Lee at Golden Harvest, whose contents include an early Mandarin version of &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, which restores the scenes listed above.

A few scenes remain missing, presumably lost. These include more footage of Chow Mei (Maria Yi) at the family home, a drunken Cheng approaching the girl at the dinner party and imagining her topless, and more of Cheng discovering the body parts in the ice.

===Alternative title confusion===

When &quot;The Big Boss&quot; was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot;, a play on the popular &quot;The French Connection&quot;, since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee&#x27;s second film, &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural &quot;Fists&quot;. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. &quot;The Big Boss&quot; was released as &quot;Fists of Fury&quot; and &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; became &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot;. Recent American TV showings and the official U.S. DVD release from 20th Century Fox in 2005 have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, though the descriptions do not match in some cases.

===Alternative music scores===
Unlike other Lee films, &quot;The Big Boss&quot; is unique in having three completely different music scores. &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; all only feature one score with minor alterations.

The first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as &quot;The Chinese Boxer&quot; and &quot;One-Armed Swordsman&quot;. This was made for the original Mandarin language version and was also used for the first English version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-Yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer Akira Ifukube&#x27;s scores for the &quot;Daimajin&quot; trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.

The second and most widespread of the music scores was by German composer Peter Thomas. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film was published on iTunes. Thomas&#x27;s involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured expatriate voice actors living in Hong Kong who worked on the Shaw Brothers&#x27; films, and used Wang Fu-ling&#x27;s score. In early 1973, American distributor National General Pictures decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the ones of other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to re-dub the film, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling&#x27;s music. The German dubbed version (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li, English: The Deadly Fist of Cheng Li), premiering before the reworked English version, features his score.

The third score is the 1982 Cantonese release score, which primarily features music from Golden Harvest composer Joseph Koo. However, a good portion of Koo&#x27;s music in the Cantonese version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, which was half Koo&#x27;s music and half Peter Thomas&#x27;s. Golden Harvest simply took Koo&#x27;s music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the Pink Floyd music cues from &quot;The Grand Vizier&#x27;s Garden Party, Part 2&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;, as well as King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic, Part Two&quot;. Other music cues were taken from old horror films and B-movies, including &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; and &quot;How To Make A Monster&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Kotaku&quot; has traced the video game usage of the term &quot;boss&quot; back to &quot;The Big Boss&quot;.

===Unofficial sequels===
In 1976, a non-canon continuation to &quot;The Big Boss&quot; was made called &quot;The Big Boss Part II&quot;, starring Bruce Le (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and Lo Lieh as Cheng&#x27;s brother, who wants revenge for their father&#x27;s murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. &quot;The Big Boss Part II&quot; was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain&#x27;s lair. The elusive film still exists, but did not make it to home video until Severin Films released a new scan of a Mandarin print as a bonus on the &quot;Enter the Clones&quot; boxset in 2024.

A later sequel, &quot;Big Boss Untouchable&quot;, was produced in 2002 with Dragon Sek in the lead role.

===Loose sequel===
In 1981, another film simply called &quot;Big Boss II&quot; (杰泉达东考, Jiě quán dà dōng kǎo) was released. Directed by Lu-Po Tu and starring Ryong Keo (Dragon Lee), Tan Yin (Bolo Yeung), Lik Cheung, Yoo-haeng Kim, Ying-Hung Lau, Fa-Yuan Li, Ni Liu, Yao-Kun Pan, Chien-Po Tsen, and Wei-Ho Tu. While transporting funds for independence movement, Lee Han-saeng is shot in the legs by the Japanese military police. He recovers from his wounds with the help of Jang Geo-chil, an independence fighter, and his daughter, Wan-ah. When the Japanese police investigate Jang&#x27;s house, Han-saeng and Jang take refuge in the home of Wan-ah&#x27;s uncle. But he sells them out, blinded by his greed for the reward on their heads. They run and hide in kisaeng Ae-hi&#x27;s home. Ae-hi and her sister Yu-ha desire revenge on the Japanese police who killed their father. But they are killed when Wan-ah&#x27;s uncle turns them to the Japanese police while Han-saeng is away. When Jang and his wife are killed, Han-saeng takes revenge on the Japanese police. In the US, the film also goes by the titles &quot;Chinese Goliath&quot;, &quot;Muscle of the Dragon&quot;, and &quot;The Deadly Dragon Lee Fights Again&quot;.

===Other actors as Bruce Lee playing Cheng Chao-an===
Various Bruce Lee biopics have been filmed over the years, with the two most famous being &quot;Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Both of these films feature their respective actors, Bruce Li and Jason Scott Lee, at one point acting as Lee on the set of &quot;The Big Boss&quot;. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In &quot;Myth&quot;, Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In &quot;Dragon&quot;, Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that &quot;Dragon&quot; makes the mistake of saying that filming for &quot;The Big Boss&quot; began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, &quot;The Legend of Bruce Lee&quot;, this time with Danny Chan Kwok-kwan as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China&#x27;s hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran Mark Dacascos. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos&#x27;s official site.

<text>Marvel Adventures, formerly Marvel Age, was an imprint of Marvel Comics intended for younger audiences, including small children. Unlike the standard comics published by Marvel, which often take place in story arcs spanning several issues, each Marvel Adventures comic tells a standalone story. In April 2012 it was replaced by the all new All Ages line tied to the Marvel Universe block on Disney XD.

==History==
===Age===
The idea was initially established as the Marvel Age imprint in 2003. The Marvel Age name had last been used as the title of a promotional magazine published by Marvel from 1983 to 1994. The initial idea for the imprint was to reuse the early plots, written by Stan Lee in the 1960s, in a modern-day setting, with new writers and artists retelling the stories. The stories would be published in the standard comic book format and quickly collected and reprinted in manga-style digest size. Several titles from Marvel&#x27;s failed Tsunami line, as well as several other Marvel series, were also collected in this format and released under the &quot;Marvel Age&quot; banner. Each book also contained character concept sketches by the artists on the last pages.

===Adventures===
In 2005 Darwyn Cooke was brought on to develop a new all-ages book based on Marvel&#x27;s heroes. The stories would be independent from the Marvel 616 Universe and feature an array of Marvel&#x27;s most popular characters. Cooke was eventually left behind by Marvel and the book carried on without him where a new batch of creators were brought on to tell stories Cooke never intended to tell. The Marvel Age imprint was relaunched as Marvel Adventures, with &quot;Marvel Age: Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Marvel Age: Fantastic Four&quot; being restarted as &quot;Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four&quot;. This time around, the stories would be original and not based on existing stories. In order to be able to tell standalone stories and to escape the trappings of having to reflect the events of other Marvel titles, none of the titles take place within the primary Marvel Universe continuity.

The titles published consist of &quot;Marvel Adventures: The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Marvel Adventures: Super Heroes&quot;. Two other titles, &quot;Marvel Adventures: Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Marvel Adventures: Hulk&quot;, were both canceled after brief runs. &quot;Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four&quot; ended its run, after 48 issues, in May, 2009. It was followed two months later by a &quot;Fantastic Four Giant-Size Adventures&quot; one-shot.

In 2010, the line was ended and then rebooted with only two titles, &quot;Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Marvel Adventures: Super Heroes&quot; returning. Both titles started over with a new first issue. Both titles ended in March 2012, and were replaced by new titles tied to the &quot;Marvel Universe&quot; cartoon block on Disney XD, and are titled &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man Adventures&quot; and &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes Adventures&quot;, respectively.

==Digests==
Marvel Digests were collections of Marvel Age/Adventures comic books compressed into smaller digest-sized books, rather than the original larger magazine form. Following theme with the Marvel Age comic books, they contained concept art sketches of characters in the back of the books.

<text>Kafr Jammal (), is a Palestinian town in the Tulkarm Governorate in the western edge of the West Bank. It is located about halfway between Qalqilyah and Tulkarm, and had a population of 2,855 in 2017. The village is mainly agricultural, and mostly raises olive and citrus crops. Kafr Jammal is at an altitude of 257 meters, and is bordered by Falamya (Falameh, Falāma) in the west, Kafr Zibad in the east, Jayyous in the south, and Kafr Sur to the north.

==History==
Ceramics from the Byzantine period have been found here.

===Ottoman period===
====16th century====
Kafr Jammal was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared under that name in the tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Bani Sa&#x27;b, part of the Nablus Sanjak. It had a population of 17 households and 13 bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on various agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and/or beehives, in addition to &quot;occasional revenues&quot; and a press for olive oil or grape syrup; a total of 11,074 akçe.

====19th century====
In 1838, &quot;Kefr Jemmal&quot; was noted as a village in the &quot;Beni Sa&#x27;ab&quot; area, west of Nablus. In 1882, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described &quot;Kefr Jemmal&quot; as &quot;a small stone village on a knoll, with
cisterns.&quot;

In the 1860s, the Ottoman authorities granted the village an agricultural plot of land called Ghabat Kafr Jammal in the former confines of the Forest of Arsur (Ar. Al-Ghaba) in the coastal plain, west of the village.

In 1870/71 (1288 AH), an Ottoman census listed the village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (sub-district) of Bani Sa&#x27;b.

===British Mandate===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kufr Jammal had a population of 396 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 499; 1 Christian and 498 Muslims, in 109 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Kafr Jammal was of 690 Muslims, with 14,945 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,702 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 4,451 were used for cereals, while 19 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===Jordanian period (1948-1967)===
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Kafr Jammal came under Jordanian rule. 

In 1961, the population of &quot;Kafr Jamal&quot; was 1,041.

===Post 1967===
Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Kafr Jammal has been under Israeli occupation.

Kafr Jammal enjoys good relations with neighboring villages, and heavy education and commercial exchange take place among them. The village is also notable for having a large diaspora outside the West Bank, mostly in Jordan, but also in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Kafr Jammal&#x27;s population follow the Hanbali and Shafi&#x27;i fiqh (schools of Sunni Islam).

== Demography ==

=== Local origins ===
The residents of Kafr Jammal have origins in Kafr a-Dik.

<text>Federation and Empire (&quot;F&amp;E&quot;) is a strategic-level board wargame set in the fictional Star Fleet Universe spinoff of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, currently published by Amarillo Design Bureau Inc. (ADB). It is a stand-alone product, but has sometimes been considered the official campaign generator for &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;.

==Overview==

In outline, &quot;Federation and Empire&quot; is fairly typical for a grand strategy game. Players take alternating turns, managing the resources of their side to build ships and defenses, and maneuver their ships (or fleets) to attack the enemy and then resolve the resulting combats; his opponent then does the same on his turn. In detail, it is a bit more sophisticated. During movement enemy ships can &quot;react&quot; a short distance onto moving ships. There are rules for the interaction of these forces, which may force some or all of the moving ships to stop, being &quot;pinned&quot; by the reacting enemy. After movement, the non-moving player can also move a few limited &quot;reserves&quot; of ships to battles so as to shore up the defense of critical points. After combat, the moving player &quot;retrogrades&quot; or moves ships that were in combat back to source of supply or repair, and finally moves a limited number of ships vast distances to prepare for the coming enemy turn.

Combat itself is resolved in a number of &quot;combat rounds&quot; after the two players each deploy their &quot;battleforces&quot;. A battleforce is the group of ships each player selects to participate in combat from the stack of starships (and other units like bases) in the battle hex. In F&amp;E there are no stacking limits, but only the ships in each battleforce may participate directly in combat, and this number is limited by the &quot;command rating&quot; of the designated &quot;flagship&quot; of the battleforce. The ship classes with the greatest command ratings are the dreadnoughts and heavy battlecruisers, with ratings of ten. Command cruisers have ratings of nine, heavy cruisers eight, and so on with the smaller ship classes. So a battleforce headed by a dreadnought could bring up to ten other warships with it into the combat phase. Certain specialty ships may be added above this limit; for instance a fleet scout or a squadron of drone bombardment ships, etc. &quot;Command points&quot; may also be expended and allocated to the battle hex, each permitting one extra ship to be added to the battleforce. Command points reflect commitments by fleet headquarters to organize and deploy more assets to the battleforce.

To resolve a combat round, the offensive rating factors for each ship/unit are summed to produce the battleforce&#x27;s &quot;compot&quot;, or combat potential. Each player also chooses a &quot;Battle Intensity Rating&quot; reflecting how aggressively the ship captains handle their ships. A die is thrown; when indexed with the BIR and adjusted for electronic warfare, a percentage is obtained. This multiplied by the compot produces the number of damage points scored on the enemy battleforce. The attacking player has the option of allocating some of this damage as &quot;directed damage&quot; on one (and only one) of his opponent&#x27;s units. The unit chosen is &quot;crippled&quot; by turning its counter over to its crippled (reverse) side. The attacker may expend more of his damage score to finish off (destroy) the enemy unit. When using directed damage the attacker must expend &quot;two&quot; points of his damage score to produce each point of directed damage (one ship can be designated by its owner to be in a protected position in the battleforce and is attacked by directed damage at a three-to-one ratio. Usually this ship is the flagship or an especially valuable unit like a fleet tug. The fleet scout and any drone bombardment ships also enjoy this advantage). Special warships known as &quot;maulers&quot;, deployed in small numbers during the General War by the Coalition (Romulan, Klingon and Lyran fleets), can inflict directed damage at a one-to-one ratio. After directed damage is resolved, remaining damage points are absorbed by the defender as he chooses at a one-to-one ratio of damage inflicted to damage taken.

Both players compute their combat results simultaneously and take turns resolving the effects of their attacks. These actions complete one round of combat. Before the next round commences, players may transfer attrition units between their battleforces and the ships not participating in the combat, e.g. fighters and fast patrol ships. The purpose of such a transfer would be to replace destroyed attrition units and restore carriers and/or PF flotillas in the battleforce to their full capacity prior to the next combat round. Then, before the following round, each player must decide to continue the combat or withdraw from the battle hex. If so, his opponent has the option of &quot;pursuit&quot; (usually in an effort to pick off cripples which are disadvantaged in their attempt to disengage). Combat rounds are repeated until one battleforce withdraws or is destroyed. An additional step is required if a flagship is destroyed or withdrawn: if a replacement flagship lacks the requisite command rating to command the number of ships in its battleforce, then the battleforce must be voluntarily reduced to the new flagship&#x27;s command rating.

Combat resolution is different in battle hexes involving bases and/or planets. Here the attacker must offer the defender an &quot;approach battle&quot; in which the attacker&#x27;s battleforce can be engaged at a distance from the base/planet by the defender&#x27;s mobile units. The base/planet cannot participate in combat directly but can lend EW support and send attrition units. The advantage here for the defender is that the base/planet cannot be fired upon until and unless the attacker destroys or drives off the defender&#x27;s battleforce. The defender may decline the approach battle in which case the base/planet may be included in his battleforce, at risk of destruction (or in the case of a planet capture or devastation). In Capital hexes of each of the races/empires (all containing several homeworld planets and the all-important Shipyards), a special pre-combat procedure involves the defender having to divide his fleet into separate battleforces for each homeworld/shipyard in the strategic battle hex. After inspecting the defender&#x27;s order of battle at each location, the attacker likewise forms independent battleforces for each of the defender&#x27;s locations; from there the usual base/planet procedure is implemented involving the mandatory offer of approach battles.

The main focus of the game is the General War, an 18-year-long conflict set in the Star Fleet Universe that involves all the major powers of the Alpha Octant. The scale is extremely large compared to board games in a terrestrial setting, with each hex on the map representing 500 parsecs. As the rules point out, this reduces the Milky Way Galaxy as shown on the map to a two dimensional object, because only the core would have a cross-section greater than one hex and the core is not rendered on the map. Units are typically individual ships, each with its own combat rating. Each of the interstellar governments or &quot;empires&quot; can have dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ships, leading to a game with a potentially very high number of counters used, on a map that is only as large as a &quot;small&quot; strategy game. However, significantly larger maps are available for purchase directly from ADB that greatly reduce this problem. Player aids also permit individual counters to represent large fleets, with the constituent ship counters being kept off map.

While nominally a two player game, players must keep each empire&#x27;s records separate, meaning that is easy to run each side as a team with up to one player per empire. Team play can involve up eight people, but more typically involves four to five players.

The main boxed set has a series of scenarios that can be played individually, but together outline the play of the entire General War. As well, it also allows for free campaigns outside of the canonical Star Fleet Universe timeline to be played, with canonical orders of battle for each of the stellar empires. The expansions typically have a number of scenarios, which may be a focused treatment of a particular part of the General War, or an alternate way the war could have begun. There are also a limited number of scenarios that show other conflicts in the region, such as the Four Powers War.

==Editions and supplements==

===Early versions===

&quot;Federation and Empire&quot; itself was originally published in 1986 by Task Force Games (TFG). The rulebook has been revised five times since then. All editions come with &#x27;fleet charts&#x27; (sheets of off-map holding areas for excess counters), &#x27;capital charts&#x27; (to detail the contents of the capital systems of the various empires), and the main map. The original set included 10 numbered sheets of double-sided counters for ships as well as two sheets of single-sided counters for markers and the like.

TFG&#x27;s first strategic level game for the Star Fleet Universe was &quot;Federation Space&quot;, released in 1981. It was derived from the current working draft of what became &quot;Federation and Empire&quot;, and so can be considered an &quot;older brother&quot; to it, even though there are notable differences between the two. One such difference was that Federation Space did not use the battleforce concept in combat resolution. All the starships in the battle hex participated in combat. The result was that the sheer quantity of ships tended to dominate the contest over the quality of the ships in the contest. This almost always resulted in hordes of the inferior ships of the Klingon Deep Space Fleet overwhelming the smaller but high-quality Federation Starfleet. Another difference with F&amp;E is that the rules for handling fleet carriers with their fighter wings were immature.

===&quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;===
&quot;Federation and Empire Deluxe Edition&quot; was published in 1989 by TFG with the significantly updated and expanded &quot;Rev-1&quot; rulebook, a nicer-looking map and a new set of counters. Deluxe Edition retained the two single-sided counter sheets, but had three identical sets of four double sided counters (referred to as A, B, C, and D), providing two extra sheets by excluding a small number of unique units. Subsequent printings included updated &quot;Rev-2&quot; and &quot;Rev-3&quot; rulebooks.

At the time, the rules mentioned an upcoming expansion, &quot;Total War&quot; which was expected to provide all the things that could not fit in the box. However, as new ships and ideas were still be promptly introduced to the SFU through &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;, this proposed expansion quickly took on dimensions equal to the original game.

*&quot;Carrier War&quot; (subtitled &quot;Total War Part One&quot;) was the first supplement offered for F&amp;E in 1993. It consisted of new rules, new scenarios, and counters providing separate carriers and escorts (which had only existed in pre-defined &quot;groups&quot; to save space in the original).
*&quot;Special Operations&quot; was a smaller module published in 1993 that brought in several new rules, such as Klingon Stasis Field Generators.
*&quot;Marine Assault&quot; was published in 1995 and featured extensive rules detailing the use of ground troops and marines in strategic operations.

===2000 Edition===

When Amarillo Design Bureau took over the publishing of all Star Fleet Universe material from TFG, they continued selling the Deluxe Edition, but soon released another large rewrite of the rules in 2000. This &quot;Rev-4&quot; rulebook is usually called &quot;&quot;F&amp;E2K&quot;.

In 2004, the countersheets were again changed, from ABCD to One and Two. (Current sheets are twice the size of old ones.) In total, the number of counters are the same, but the counters that players may want extras of have been segregated onto Two, so that they can be bought separately. Once the counters are punched out, there are no differences between &quot;F&amp;E2K4&quot;&quot; and the previous version.

*&quot;Advanced Operations&quot;, published in 2003, was the first new expansion after the rewrite in &quot;F&amp;E2K&quot; and focuses on the later years of the General War with X-ships, heavy war destroyers, as well as more sweeping rules like raids and battlegroups.
*&quot;Combined Operations&quot; was published in 2003 as a revised replacement for both &quot;Special Ops&quot; and &quot;Marine Assault&quot;. It provided a much-needed rewrite of elements of the earlier expansions and included new content such as police ships.
*&quot;Fighter Operations&quot; was published in 2004 as an updated version of &quot;Carrier War&quot; and also introduced new carrier types to the game.
*&quot;Planetary Operations&quot;, published in 2004, features more ways of producing and repairing ships, like planetary repair docks and depot-level repair.
*&quot;Strategic Operations&quot;, includes rules and counters for hospital ships, sector bases, diplomatic teams, and other additions to the game system.

In addition, &quot;Captain&#x27;s Log&quot; has a regular section devoted to the game, and often includes preview material for future expansions, such as the set of trial rules for the Interstellar Concordium in issue 25.

===2010 Edition===

In March 2010, ADB Inc. released a new edition of Federation and Empire, the first significant change since the 2000 edition. While the map and various charts are identical to the previous edition, key differences include a new rulebook and all new counter sheets.

The 2010 rulebook includes all previous errata, and addresses new issues discovered in the 10 years since the previous edition. Many rules were updated to better combine with the various expansion products, and to accommodate the expanded counter mix provided by the new counter sheets.

Due to changes in manufacturing, the counter sheets now contain over 2100 counters (as opposed to over 1500 of the previous edition). This allowed the many carrier groups in the game to exist as individual ships instead of multi-ship counters, and the new rules eliminated the special bookkeeping this once required.

ADB plans to convert the Deluxe Edition expansions to the new 2010 rules in the future.

*&quot;ISC War&quot; published in June 2011, brings the Interstellar Concordium into the game after a 25-year wait. The game includes the &quot;ISC pacification&quot; scenario at the end of the General War, as well as a scenario on the expansion of the ISC to their borders at the beginning of General War.
*&quot;Minor Empires&quot; published in 2017, includes the rules and counters for the Vudar, Lyran Democratic Republic and the Seltorians, as well as several scenarios showcasing these empires.
*&quot;Tactical Operations&quot; will be primarily a counters only product with minimal rules and adding ships not currently in the game from previously published Star Fleet Battles products.
*&quot;Civil Wars&quot; will cover the Romulan Civil War and the Kzinti War of Return (both from the end of the General War), the Lyran Civil Wars from before the General War, as well as the introduction of WYN and Lyran Democratic Republic to the Federation and Empire system.
*&quot;Fighter Operations&quot; was updated again in 2016.

<text>The Hardangerfjord () is the fifth longest fjord in the world, and the second longest fjord in Norway. It is located in Vestland county in the Hardanger region. The fjord stretches from the Atlantic Ocean into the mountainous interior of Norway along the Hardangervidda plateau. The innermost point of the fjord reaches the town of Odda.

==Location==
The Hardangerfjord starts at the Atlantic Ocean about south of the city of Bergen. Here the fjord heads in a northeasterly direction between the island of Bømlo and the mainland. It passes by the larger islands of Stord, Tysnesøya, and Varaldsøy on the north/west side and the Folgefonna peninsula on the south/east side. Once it is surrounded by the mainland, it begins to branch off into smaller fjords that reach inwards towards the grand Hardangervidda mountain plateau. The longest branch of the Hardangerfjord is Sørfjorden which cuts south about from the main fjord. Its maximum depth is more than just outside the village of Norheimsund in the middle of the fjord.

Norway&#x27;s third largest glacier is found on the Folgefonna peninsula, along of the Hardangerfjord. With its three parts, the Folgefonna glacier covers an area of , and in 2005 it became protected as Folgefonna National Park.

The area of the fjord is divided among several municipalities in Vestland county: Bømlo, Eidfjord, Etne, Kvam, Kvinnherad, Stord, Sveio, Tysnes, Ullensvang, Ulvik, and Voss. The total number of inhabitants living in all these municipalities along the fjord is only slightly more than 70,000 - on a total area of .

==History==
About 8,000 BC, the Scandinavian land mass started to rise up as enormous glacial ice started to melt. The lower parts of the valleys became flooded, and so created what we today know as the Hardangerfjord. The valley was originally not only made through glacial erosion but by the high pressure melting water which pushed its way beneath the ice.

The history of the fjord goes far beyond its Viking history, back to the time of hunters on the surrounding mountains, and later on, farming along this fertile area which today is considered the &quot;fruit orchard of Norway&quot;. Later the fjord became the birthplace for a large tourism influx to Norway, and in 1875 Thomas Cook started weekly cruise departures from London to the Hardangerfjord, due to its spectacular nature, glaciers, and grand waterfalls. Soon after this, many of the major waterfalls became the power source for large industries in fjord settlements such as the town of Odda.

==Economy==
Hardangerfjord has recently seen an increase in tourism. New infrastructure was built for travelers and the location has once again become an industry for the local communities along the fjord.

The fjord has good conditions for fish farming. Fish farms yearly produce more than 40,000 tons of salmon and rainbow trout which makes the Hardangerfjord one of four major fish farming regions in the world.

Hardangerfjord&#x27;s melt-water is also bottled at source to form the product Isklar, sold worldwide.

<text>Prudential plc is a British-domiciled multinational insurance and asset management company headquartered in London and Hong Kong. It was founded in London in May 1848 to provide loans to professional and working people.

Prudential has dual primary listings on the London Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It also has secondary listings on the New York Stock Exchange and Singapore Exchange.

==History==

===Early history===
The company was founded in Hatton Garden in London in May 1848 as The Prudential, Investment, Loan, and Assurance Association and in September 1848 changed its name to The Prudential Mutual Assurance, Investment, and Loan Association, to provide loans to professional and working people. In 1854, the company began selling the relatively new concept of Industrial Branch insurance policies to the working class population for premiums as low as one penny a week through agents acting as door to door salesmen. The army of premium collection agents was for many years identified with the Prudential as the &quot;Man from the Pru&quot;. The company moved to its long-time home at Holborn Bars in 1879 and converted to a limited company in 1881. The building was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, and is built of terracotta manufactured by Gibbs and Canning of Tamworth (c.1878): two of the same driving forces behind the Natural History Museum in London.

===Late 20th century===

The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1924.

In the mid-1980s, financial deregulation allowed financial institutions to own estate agencies, and Prudential decided to follow early market entrants such as Provident Financial Group plc (Whitegates) and Lloyds Bank (Black Horse Agencies), in summer 1985 by purchasing a long-established and successful Huntingdon-based firm of estate agents, Ekins, Dilley and Handley, for £12 million. This was originally intended as an experiment allowing the company a new route to market for mortgage-linked endowment policies; however after many other financial institutions followed suit, Prudential rapidly started to embark on an acquisition trail which would quickly see it become market leader in terms of number of offices. Acquisitions included Chestertons Residential and Earl &amp; Lawrence in August 1986, Edward Bailey &amp; Son in January 1987, The Channel Island Estate Agency Property Shop in February 1987, and Rogers &amp; Clark in May 1987. This was however done at great cost. Although a typical cost of establishing a new estate agency branch was around £75,000–£100,000, Prudential paid a total of £125 million for 337 of its branches: an average cost per branch of £371,000.

In 1986, Prudential acquired the American insurer Jackson National Life. In the same year, amongst many other acquisitions, Prudential Property Services acquired the fifty-two strong chain of Reeds Rains for £24 million.

The collapse of the housing market in the south of England in 1989 brought about a slump in income at Prudential Property Services, which during the first half of 1990 lost £23 million. Prudential had been closing branches, with 100 closing between December 1988 and May 1990. After these losses were announced, another 175 branches closed in July 1990. In May 1991 Prudential sold the remainder of the chain for a total of £13.5 million, representing a 90% loss on the cost of acquisition. Some branches were purchased by their original owners for fractions of the price they had received from the Prudential just a few years earlier. For example, the Prudential Property Services office in Hanwell was originally an independent agency, purchased by Prudential for £200,000: it was subsequently sold off to Rolfe East Estate Agents for £1. The western division of Prudential Property Services was sold to Scottish Widows to join their Connells Estate Agents chain. The northern division was sold in a £3.4 million management buyout reverting to the name, Reeds Rains, the south east division was sold to become Arun Estates, and Chestertons and another region were sold to the Woolwich Property Services.

In 1997, Prudential acquired Scottish Amicable, a business founded in 1826 in Glasgow as the West of Scotland Life Insurance Company, for £1.75 bn.

In 1998, Prudential set up Egg, an internet bank in the UK. The subsidiary reached 550,000 customers within nine months, but had difficulty achieving profitability. In June 2000, an initial public offering of 21% was made to allow for further growth of the internet business, but in February 2006 Prudential decided to repurchase the 21% share of Egg. Egg was subsequently sold to Citibank in January 2007. In 1999, M&amp;G, a UK fund management company, was acquired. In June 2000, the company was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange to help focus on the US market.

===21st century===

In February 2002, Churchill bought Prudential&#x27;s general insurance business.

In October 2004, Prudential launched a new subsidiary, PruHealth, a joint venture with Discovery Holdings of South Africa selling private medical insurance to the UK market. In April 2008, Prudential outsourced its back office functions to Capita: about 3,000 jobs were transferred (1,000 in Stirling, 750 in Reading and 1,250 in Mumbai). This significant outsourcing deal, worth an estimated £722m over a 15-year contract, built on Prudential&#x27;s existing relationship with Capita, who took over its Belfast operation in 2006 along with about 450 employees in a smaller operational restructure.

On 1 March 2010, Prudential announced that it was in &quot;advanced talks&quot; to purchase the pan-Asian life insurance company of AIG, American International Assurance (AIA) for approximately £23 billion. The deal later collapsed, and AIA ended up raising money in an IPO.

In December 2013, Prudential announced the purchase of Ghana&#x27;s Express Life Company. Express Life was subsequently rebranded as Prudential Ghana. In April 2014, Prudential launched two corporate responsibility initiatives to support education in Ghana: the Prudential Scholarship Programme for more than 500 senior high school students, in partnership with the NGO Plan Ghana; and a scheme to support actuarial science graduates. In September 2014, Prudential purchased Kenyan life insurer Shield Assurance and rebranded it as Prudential Kenya, further expanding the company&#x27;s presence in Africa. Prudential has since entered six other African countries – Uganda in 2015, Zambia in 2016, Nigeria in 2017, Cameroon, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Togo in 2019.

On 10 March 2015, it was announced that the CEO, Tidjane Thiam, would leave Prudential to become the next CEO of Credit Suisse. On 1 May 2015, it was announced that Mike Wells, head of the company&#x27;s US business, would succeed Tidjane Thiam as CEO, on a pay package worth up to £7.5 million.

In August 2017, it was announced that Prudential was to combine its asset manager, M&amp;G, and Prudential UK &amp; Europe to form M&amp;GPrudential.

In November 2017, Prudential announced the change in the name of its joint venture with Chinese investment company CITIC to &quot;CITIC Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited&quot;.

In March 2018, Prudential announced that it would demerge M&amp;GPrudential from the Group; the demerger was completed on 21 October 2019.

In 2021, the company demerged its US business Jackson National Life leaving it focused solely on African and Asian markets. 

As of March 2022, 60 percent of Prudential&#x27;s head office staff were based in Hong Kong, and fewer than 200 employees were in London.

==Operations==

The company has two business units:

* Prudential Corporation Asia: based in Hong Kong, the business is the largest UK life assurer in Asia. It has had a presence in the continent since 1923 when an overseas agency for life assurance was created in India. Although this was subsequently nationalised, Prudential relaunched in India in 2000 as ICICI Prudential, a 26% joint venture with ICICI Bank. As CITIC Prudential Life, a 50–50 joint venture, they were the first UK company to re-establish a life business in mainland China in 2000. There are also businesses in Cambodia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Prudential&#x27;s Asian asset management business, Eastspring Investments, has total funds under management of US$247.8 billion.
* Since 2014 Prudential has been building a multi-product, multi-distribution business in Africa, with operations now in eight countries across the continent, including Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Cameroon and over one million customers. Nairobi has been the regional office for Prudential&#x27;s Africa business since 2021.

==Prudential RideLondon==
Prudential were the inaugural sponsor of RideLondon, an annual two-day cycling festival, held for the first time in 2013. The 2017 Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 set a new fundraising record for the event, with £12.75 million raised for charity, bringing the total raised by the event to more than £53 million in its first five years.

The event was developed by the Mayor of London and his agencies and is organised by the London &amp; Surrey Cycling Partnership. The main events are a 100-mile professional road race through Surrey and London, and an amateur race along the same route. Participants in the amateur race typically raise money for good causes. The 20,709 finishers in the 2014 event raised more than £10 million for charity. Prudential ended its title sponsorship of RideLondon in 2020.

<text>Since its founding in 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) has had a diplomatic tug-of-war with its rival in Taiwan, the Republic of China (ROC). Throughout the Cold War, both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all China and allowed countries to recognize either one or the other. Until the 1970s, most Western countries in the Western Bloc recognized the ROC while the Eastern Bloc and Third World countries generally recognized the PRC. This gradually shifted and today only while the PRC is recognized by the United Nations, as well as 181 UN member states (including 18 G20 member states), Cook Islands, Niue and the State of Palestine. Both the ROC and the PRC maintain the requirement of recognizing its view of the One China policy to establish or maintain diplomatic relations.

==Recognition of the PRC before it was seated at the UN==

===1949===
The PRC was established on 1 October 1949, when the Chinese Civil War was still underway, and the seat of Government of the Republic of China in Canton was not relocated to Taipei until December 1949. All the countries that recognized the new PRC government in 1949 were communist states.

=== 1950s ===

===1960s===
===1970s===
==Recognition of the PRC after it was seated at the UN==
The Republic of China, which had occupied China&#x27;s seat at the United Nations since 1945, was effectively expelled on 25 October 1971, through Resolution 2758 approved in the general assembly of said date. Its seat was taken over by the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 15 November 1971, and the migration of relations to the PRC soon followed among members of the Western Bloc, except for the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy and the Scandinavian Countries which had previously established diplomatic relations.

<doc id="1047770" wikidata="Q3259412" url="?curid=1047770" title="Lords Commissioners of the Treasury">
<text>In the United Kingdom there are at least six Lords (or Lady) Commissioners of His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury, serving as a commission for the ancient office of Treasurer of the Exchequer. The board consists of the First Lord of the Treasury, the Second Lord of the Treasury, and four or more junior lords acting as whips in the House of Commons to whom this title is usually applied.

It is commonly thought that the Lords Commissioners of HM Treasury serve as commissioners for exercising the office of Lord High Treasurer; however, this is not true. The confusion arises because both offices used to be held by the same individual at the same time.

Strictly they are commissioners for exercising the office of Treasurer of the Exchequer of Great Britain and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland (similar to the status of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty exercising the office of Lord High Admiral until 1964, when Elizabeth II resumed the office). These offices (excluding Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, which went into commission in 1817) have continually been in commission since the resignation in 1714 of Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury, who was appointed to the office by Queen Anne on her deathbed.

Until the 19th century, this commission made most of the economic decisions of Great Britain (England, before the Act of Union 1707). However, starting during the 19th century, these positions became sinecure positions, with the First Lord serving almost invariably as Prime Minister, the Second Lord invariably as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the junior lords serving as whips in Parliament.

As an office in commission, technically all Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are of equal rank, with their ordinal numbers connoting seniority rather than authority over their fellow Lords Commissioners. However, from at least the reign of Queen Anne, &quot;de facto&quot; power has rested with the top-numbered Lords.

==Current officeholders==
The current Lords Commissioners of the Treasury were appointed by letters patent dated 16 July 2024.

==Relationship with Ministers of HM Treasury==
Of all the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, typically the only one who actually works in HM Treasury is the Second Lord, as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since the formation of the office of Prime Minister (including in the case of Sir Robert Walpole as the inaugural holder), it has been typical for the incumbent to assume also the position of First Lord of the Treasury.

None of the other lords of the Treasury work for the Treasury in a substantive sense. Rather they are government whips, given nominal positions in the Treasury to enable them to be suitably remunerated for facilitating the function of His Majesty&#x27;s Government. The Commission of the Treasury is suitably flexible for the government&#x27;s whip operation because it has no fixed number of office-holders. However, the Chief Whip is not personally a lord of the Treasury, instead having the similar, but discrete, position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, which is also a sinecure used to procure paid membership among the members of the Government.

The lords of the Treasury nominally head HM Treasury. They do so by virtue of office and as a matter of law, acting in the office of Treasurer of the Exchequer. The Chancellor does so in reality, consulting the Prime Minister, and delegating parliamentary-level work to the other ministers in the Treasury, none of whom are Lords of the Treasury, who negotiate and formulate the rest of Treasury business. These junior ministerial positions are, in descending order of rank:

* Chief Secretary to the Treasury (effectively a Cabinet member, as the incumbent always has the right to attend meetings if not a full, statutory member)
* Financial Secretary to the Treasury (often paired with the office of Paymaster General, which is not always allocated to the Treasury)
* Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
* Economic Secretary to the Treasury
* Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury

==Relationship between the First and Second Lords==
Historically, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was also the First Lord of the Treasury, and usually by extension Prime Minister as well. However, the increasing sophistication of government spending led to the development of the chancellorship into a more refined position of finance minister, and so gradually particularised the office in a way less suitable for headship of the ministry overall. The last Chancellor-Prime Minister was Stanley Baldwin in 1923, and then only very briefly – the last substantive overlap was William Gladstone in 1880–1882.

A more immediately significant trend though was the rebalancing of the powers of the Houses of Parliament in favour of the lower house. From the Glorious Revolution and onwards it had become increasingly constitutionally untenable for the person setting fiscal policy (i.e. the Chancellor) to reside in the House of Lords, a principle which was embedded permanently in the constitution from 1718 with the resignation of James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope (note this excepts the brief tenures of certain Lord Chief Justices, who historically assumed the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer &quot;pro tempore&quot; during vacancies, and who were often peers). That notwithstanding, the constitutional convention mandating that the Prime Minister reside in the Commons became embedded much later, with a Prime Minister serving without difficulty from the Lords as late as 1902. That Alec Douglas-Home, the last to assume the Premiership from the Lords in 1963, felt compelled to disclaim his peerage and take up a seat in the Commons shows that the convention had, by that time, become well-entrenched.

Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Prime Ministers would continue to be drawn regularly from the upper house. In circumstances where the Prime Minister was a peer it was felt appropriate for the head of the ministry overall to take the primus inter pares position on the commission as First Lord, even if through constitutional convention he couldn&#x27;t serve as the Chancellor, who was otherwise First Lord by virtue of his office. The office of First Lord thus became strongly intertwined with the (legally non-existent) Premiership was particularly strong because all Prime Ministers up to Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, apart from William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, had been First Lords. Accordingly, when the Prime Minister sat in the Lords, the Chancellor assumed the Second Lordship. The constitutional entrenchment of this principle began in 1841 with the appointment of the Second Peel ministry. Being a viscount, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne (the outgoing Prime Minister) had not been able to be Chancellor as well, but nevertheless assumed the First Lordship pursuant to his premiership in the usual way for premiers from the peerage. However, when Sir Robert Peel returned to office for his non-consecutive second term he elected to be First Lord of Treasury, a title he had naturally assumed in his first ministry wherein he had also served as Chancellor. But despite being a Member of Parliament (i.e. not a Lord), Peel did not assume the Chancellorship. Thus the Chancellor, Henry Goulburn, became the first Chancellor to be Second Lord of the Treasury whilst the First Lord was also in the Commons. From that point onwards, the Second Lordship, save on the rare occasion that the Prime Minister holds both 10 and 11 Downing Street, has been permanently vested in the Chancellor.

==Relationship between the First Lord of the Treasury and the Prime Minister==
Since the evolution of the position, the Prime Minister has also served as First Lord of the Treasury in all but two cases. The initial linkage of the two offices is not surprising, since at the formation of the office the First Lord of the Treasury did indeed take part in running the Treasury, and as First Lord was the most senior person so tasked. Since control of money usually granted most power, it is not surprising that such a person would head the government as a whole. Indeed, even after decades of the emergence of the premiership, William Pitt the Younger proffered that the Prime Minister &quot;ought to be the person at the head of the finances.&quot;
The two exceptions were Lord Chatham and Lord Salisbury. During Chatham&#x27;s ministry of 1766–68 he occupied the office of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal instead. Lord Salisbury became First Lord neither during his first term (1885–1886) nor his third (1895–1902), though he did become First Lord for the first two years of his second ministry (1886–1892).

Since Salisbury, the two roles have become completely concomitant, so much so that the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence, 10 Downing Street, is in fact the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, which title is named on the letter box. Salisbury, as a marquess of vast independent wealth, had no use of an official residence, instead living in his grander town house at 20 Arlington Street in St James&#x27;s, and could instead bestow it as a perquisite to other ministers, along with the First Lordship itself.

Other positions have been linked to the Prime Ministership as well. Continuously since 1968, when the position was created by Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister has also served as Minister for the Civil Service. The adoption of this additional position was directly linked to reforms to HM Treasury, being created when responsibilities for the pay and management of the civil service was transferred from the Treasury to a new Civil Service Department. Since the Prime Minister was a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, prior to the reform he had had &quot;ex officio&quot; oversight of these portfolios, but it was felt more proper for the civil service to be held outside of a particularised department. Nevertheless, in recognition of the primary authority of the Prime Minister over the Civil Service, it is a constitutional convention that the Ministry would always be held by the Prime Minister. Though the Civil Service Department was abolished by Margaret Thatcher in 1982, the title was retained. Whereas the First Lordship of the Treasury has been a complete sinecure for some time, the functions of the Minister for the Civil Service have at times required the Prime Minister to discharge policy and be held accountable for it. For instance, it was occupying this role which saw the Prime Minister sued for her policies in &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot;.

Other offices have historically been linked to the Prime Ministership but are no longer. Until Clement Attlee became Prime Minister, the vast majority of premiers had served as either Leader of the House of Commons or Leader of the House of Lords depending on the chamber in which they sat. As the power of the executive swelled, the need to have a legislative-oriented office receded. In 1942 during the Second World War Winston Churchill had made himself Minister of Defence, a title Prime Ministers would hold for thirteen years thereafter, but with the decline of defence as an urgent policy area this was abandoned by Sir Anthony Eden when he came to office in 1955. Boris Johnson held the position of Minister for the Union, which he created to display his commitment to strengthening the bond of the four nations of the United Kingdom. This role was retained by his successor Liz Truss.

Accordingly, the First Lord of the Treasury is the title most associated with the Prime Ministership. Seven Prime Ministers saw fit to occupy the post of First Lord of the Treasury only, and held no other subsidiary office. Those Prime Ministers were Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham (1782), William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (1807–1809), David Lloyd George (1916–1922), Sir Anthony Eden (1955–57), Harold Macmillan (1957–1963), Sir Alec Douglas-Home (1963–1964), and Harold Wilson (1964–1968, at which point he also became Minister for the Civil Service).

<text>The Three Communiqués or Three Joint Communiqués () are a collection of three joint statements made by the governments of the United States (US) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The communiqués played a crucial role in the establishment of relations between the US and the PRC and continue to be an essential element in dialogue between the two states, along with the Six Assurances and Taiwan Relations Act.

==1st==

The first communiqué (February 28, 1972), known as the Shanghai Communiqué, summarizes the landmark dialogue begun by President Richard Nixon and Premier Zhou Enlai during February 1972. Some of the issues addressed in this communiqué include the two sides&#x27; views on Vietnam, the Korean Peninsula, India and Pakistan and the Kashmir region, and perhaps most importantly, the Taiwan (Republic of China) issue (i.e., Taiwan&#x27;s political status). Essentially, both sides agreed to respect each other&#x27;s national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States formally &quot;acknowledged&quot; that &quot;all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China&quot; and that the &quot;United States Government does not challenge that position&quot;, and that it &quot;reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves&quot;.

The use of the word &quot;acknowledge&quot; (rather than &quot;accept&quot;) is often cited as an example of the United States&#x27; ambiguous position regarding the future of Taiwan.

==2nd==

The second communiqué (January 1, 1979), the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, formally announces the commencement of normal relations between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In so doing, the United States recognized that the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was the sole legal government of China, and acknowledged the PRC&#x27;s position that Taiwan is part of China. In addition, the United States government declared that it would end formal political relations with the Republic of China (&quot;Taiwan&quot;) while preserving economic and cultural ties. Both sides reaffirmed their wish to reduce the risk of international conflict as well as avoidance of hegemony of any nation in the Asia-Pacific region.

==3rd==

The third communiqué (August 17, 1982), also known as the August 17th communiqué, reaffirms the desire of both sides to further strengthen economic, cultural, educational, scientific, and technological ties. Both sides also reaffirmed the statements made about the Taiwan issue in the previous communiqué. Although no definitive conclusions were reached on the issue of arms sale to Taiwan, the United States declared its intent to continue selling arms to Taiwan and to gradually change its level of arms sales consistent with the PRC&#x27;s militarization of the Taiwan strait.

A declassified cable sent on July 10, 1982, from Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to AIT director James R. Lilley explained that reducing arms sales to Taiwan would be contingent on the commitment of the PRC to a peace across the Taiwan Strait. Afterwards, the US clarified the third communique by issuing the Six Assurances to Taiwan.

<text>William Fay (9 September 1943 – 22 February 2025) was an English singer-songwriter. His early recordings were released by Deram, but following the release of his second album in 1971, Fay was dropped by the label. His work enjoyed a growing cult status in the 1990s, and his older works were re-issued in 1998 and 2004–2005. Fay&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Life Is People&quot; was his first album of all-new material since 1971. His last album, &quot;Countless Branches&quot;, was released on 17 January 2020.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Fay was born on 9 September 1943 in north London, where he lived throughout his life.

His first single, &quot;Some Good Advice&quot; / &quot;Screams in the Ears&quot;, was issued on the Deram label in 1967, and was followed by two albums, &quot;Bill Fay&quot; in 1970 and &quot;Time of the Last Persecution&quot; in 1971. The recordings did not sell well, and Fay was dropped from Deram soon after the release of his second album. They were re-issued in 1998, and then again in 2005.

Despite returning to the recording studio in the late 1970s, &quot; Tomorrow, Tomorrow &amp; Tomorrow&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Time of the Last Persecution&quot; was not released until January 2005, following the reissues of his earlier works.

===Cult status and comeback===
Fay&#x27;s work enjoyed a growing cult status in the 1990s. His first two albums were re-issued in 1998, an event which Bill Fay described in 2012 as follows:
In 2004, the British label Wooden Hill released a collection of demos recorded between 1966 and 1970 entitled &quot;From the Bottom of an Old Grandfather Clock&quot;. Recordings from 1978-1981 were finally released in January 2005. Entitled &quot;Tomorrow, Tomorrow &amp; Tomorrow&quot;, the album was credited to the Bill Fay Group, and released on the Durtro Jnana label.

The compilation album &quot;Still Some Light&quot; appeared on the Coptic Cat label in 2010, a double CD containing a mix of older material and newer, home-recorded songs.

Released on 21 August 2012 on Dead Oceans, &quot;Life is People&quot; was his first new studio LP in over 40 years.

&quot;Who Is the Sender?&quot;, a new album by Bill Fay was released in April 2015. The second album track, &quot;War Machine&quot;, came out as a single in February 2015.

A feature article entitled &quot;Bill Fay Was a Hidden Gem. One Musician Made Finding Him a Mission&quot; was published in the New York Times on 15 January 2020.

His last album, &quot;Countless Branches&quot;, was released on 17 January 2020.

Fay died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in London, on 22 February 2025, at the age of 81.

==Covers and appreciation==
The American band Wilco has played Fay&#x27;s song &quot;Be Not So Fearful&quot; in live performances and the band&#x27;s singer, Jeff Tweedy, can be heard singing it in the documentary, &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco&quot;. Fay joined the band and Tweedy onstage for the rendition of the song at shows at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in 2007, and at the Union Chapel, Islington in 2010 respectively, both in London.

The English singer-songwriter and pianist John Howard recorded a cover version of the song &quot;Be Not So Fearful&quot; for his E.P. &quot;Songs for the Lost and Found&quot; (2008). The song &quot;Be Not So Fearful&quot; was also covered by Ed Harcourt on the benefit compilation album &quot;Songs to Save a Life - In Aid of Samaritans&quot; (2011).

A cover version of Fay&#x27;s &quot;Pictures of Adolf Again&quot;, by producer and musician Jim O&#x27;Rourke and Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche, can be heard in the film from Kōji Wakamatsu, &quot;United Red Army&quot;. The title track of &quot;Time of the Last Persecution&quot; became a live standard of the British Apocalyptic folk group, Current 93.

The band Okkervil River covered Fay&#x27;s song &quot;Plan D&quot; on their &quot;Golden Opportunities 2&quot; EP in 2011.

The American band The War on Drugs covered Fay&#x27;s song &quot;I Hear You Calling&quot; at shows throughout 2014.

His song &quot;Be Not So Fearful&quot; was covered by A.C. Newman in 2014, and was used in the episode &quot;Us&quot; of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

In 2008 the English singer Marc Almond recorded a live version of &quot;Cosmic Boxer&quot; and it was released on his album &quot;In &#x27;Bluegate Fields&#x27;: Live at Wilton&#x27;s Music Hall&quot;.

In a widely available live bootleg recording of a show at The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco in February 2009, Stephen Malkmus of the band Pavement, covered Fay&#x27;s &quot;We Have Laid Here&quot;.

<doc id="1047780" wikidata="Q6044736" url="?curid=1047780" title="Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship of Canada">
<text>Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship of Canada, or InterVarsity is an evangelical Christian student movement with affiliate groups on university campuses in Canada. It is a member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. 

Nigel Pollock is the current president. Prior to taking this role he spent 18 years with the University and Colleges Christian Fellowship in Scotland and for the past 10 years, the Tertiary Student Christian Fellowship in New Zealand.
The organizational center is in Mississauga, Ontario. 

==History==
In 1928 Norman Grubb reported to the Inter-Varsity Fellowship (IVF) in Britain of the spiritual decay happening at Canadian universities. In response, IVF sent Dr. Howard Guinness to Canada to help start evangelical student work at the universities. For fourteen months Guinness traveled across Canada, meeting with students at the universities and providing them with a model of daily prayer meet ups and weekly Bible study. Guinness also promoted training leaders in high schools and camps.

InterVarsity was officially organized in late 1929. In 1934 Stacey Woods became the new general secretary of InterVarsity in Canada and in 1938 he helped establish the first InterVarsity chapters in the United States.
Typically, InterVarsity meetings are composed of small groups of Christians meeting for weekly prayer and study. In the early 1990s, many groups experimented with additional large worship services in campus bars. This was the result of a large on campus evangelistic outreach that took place at McMaster university in 1991 featuring the British evangelist Michael Green and his team from Regent College in Vancouver. Originally the vision of Michael Hare who died in a car accident in January 1988, the mission featured a debate with the popular psychology professor Richard Day and a religious contemporary worship service in the campus bar, The Rat. Two more of these worship services were held under the leadership of Buff Cox, the InterVarsity staff worker, and Gregory Butler, the InterVarsity president at the time. In subsequent years, the worship services grew to attract hundreds of students at a time from all over Southern Ontario. The services moved to the larger bar, the Downstairs John, and became Church at the John. In subsequent years, the McMaster Chapter grew significantly and engaged in oversees missions, including a close connection to Lithuanian Christian University Students after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

<doc id="1047782" wikidata="Q3101410" url="?curid=1047782" title="George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield">
<text>General George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield, (25 December 1717 – 6 July 1790) was a Scottish officer of the British Army, who served in three major wars during the 18th century. He rose to distinction during the Seven Years&#x27; War when he fought in Germany and participated in the British attacks on Belle Île (France) and Cuba. Eliott is most notable for his command of the Gibraltar garrison during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, which lasted from 1779 to 1783, during the American War of Independence. He was celebrated for his successful defence of the fortress and decisive defeat of Spanish and French attackers.

==Life==
===Early life===
Eliott was born at Wells House, near Stobs Castle, Roxburghshire, the 10th (and 8th surviving) son of Sir Gilbert Eliott, 3rd Baronet, of Stobs, by his distant cousin Eleanor Elliot of Brugh and Wells in Roxburghshire. Eleanor&#x27;s brother was the soldier and courtier William Elliot of Wells. One of his Eleanor&#x27;s sisters, Charlotte, had married Roger Elliott, another Governor of Gibraltar.

===Education and early command===
Eliott was educated at the University of Leiden in the Dutch Republic and studied artillery and other military subjects at the &quot;école militaire&quot; of La Fère in France. He served with the Prussian Army between 1735 and 1736.

In 1741 he transferred to the Engineers and joined the 2nd Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, of which his maternal uncle, William Elliot of Wells, was then lieutenant-colonel, and of which Eliott was afterwards lieutenant-colonel. He served throughout the War of Austrian Succession between 1742 and 1748, fighting at the Battle of Dettingen, where he was wounded, and again at the Battle of Fontenoy. He became an &quot;Engineer Extraordinary&quot; in 1744 and &quot;Engineer Ordinary&quot; in 1747 when he was stationed at Sheerness. Eliott resigned from the Engineers in 1757.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

Eliott served as ADC to King George II between 1756 and 1759 during which time he was raised to colonel. Appointed Brigadier for the 1758 expedition to France, where he was placed in command of the Brigade of Light Cavalry, he was tasked to raise, and was appointed colonel of, the 1st Light Horse (later 15th Light Dragoons, then 15th Hussars). Eliott distinguished himself in the German campaign, particularly during the Battle of Minden in 1759 when he was promoted to major-general and the 1760 Battle of Emsdorf.

He took part in the Capture of Belle Île in 1761. He was 2nd-in-charge at the capture of Havana during the 1762 British expedition against Cuba for which he received a significant amount of prize money, nearly £25,000. Elliot was able to buy Bayley Park in East Sussex which he altered and enlarged over the decade. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1765. On 6 March 1775 he was made a Privy Counsellor and temporarily appointed commander of forces in Ireland.

===Gibraltar and the Great Siege===
On 25 May 1777 Eliott was appointed Governor of Gibraltar, taking over from the acting governor, Robert Boyd. Eliott was promoted to general in 1778.

In July 1779, Gibraltar was besieged by the French and Spanish. Eliott using his engineering skills to good effect in improving the fortifications. By August, it was very apparent that the Spanish intended to starve the garrison. The Great Siege of Gibraltar would eventually last from 1779 to 1783. A notable letter from Eliott to the Misses Fuller survives, dated 21 September 1779 and delivered on 4 October, it said simply &quot;Nothing new. G.A.E.&quot; Eliott was an abstemious man, his diet comprising vegetables, biscuit and water. He also rarely slept for more than four hours at a time.

On 13 September 1782, the French and Spanish initiated a grand attack, involving 100,000 men, 48 ships and 450 cannon. Under great duress, the garrison held its position and, by 1783, the siege was finishing. On 8 January 1783, the British Parliament sent their official thanks to Eliott and he was nominated a Knight of the Bath. By 6 February 1783, the siege was over. Eliott was invested with his honour at Gibraltar on 23 April.

A portrait from 1784, &quot;The Siege of Gibraltar&quot; (1782) by George Carter survives in the National Portrait Gallery.

===Later career===
Eliott returned to England in 1787. He was created Lord Heathfield, Baron Heathfield of Gibraltar on 6 July 1787 and in addition many statues, portraits and coins were produced in his honour.

A will exists dated 27 February 1788. On 19 May 1788 Eliott was formally installed as Knight of the Bath, and, in June 1788, a portrait &quot;The Installation Supper&quot; was painted by James Gillray and resides in the National Portrait Gallery.

About this time, Eliott was making his way overland back to Gibraltar, where he was still governor. However, he became ill and stayed in the Aachen area to recuperate. During 1790, he stayed at Grossen Hotel, Dubigk; Karlsbad (bei Herr Brammertz); Kaiserbad, Aachen (bei Herr Mohren). In June 1790 he rented the Schloss Kalkofen, Aachen (nowadays Talbotstrasse, Aachen, Germany), and moved in his furniture but did not live long to enjoy the facilities.

==Personal life, family and death==

Eliott was a teetotaller and vegetarian. It was recorded that he &quot;never touched strong liquor or meat, but lived chiefly on vegetables, simple puddings, and water&quot;. He did not sleep for more than four hours at a time.

On 8 September 1748 at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, London, George Augustus Eliott married Anne Pollexfen Drake (1726–1772), the sister of Sir Francis Drake, 5th Baronet (1723-1794) of Nutwell House, Woodbury in Devon, a collateral descendant of Sir Francis Drake. They had two children:
# Francis Augustus Eliott, 2nd Baron Heathfield (31 December 1750 – 26 January 1813), who never married, had no offspring and was therefore the last Baron Heathfield. He inherited Nutwell from his uncle Sir Francis Drake, 5th Baronet (1723-1794);
# Anne Pollexfen Eliott (1754-24 February 1835), who married John Trayton Fuller on 21 May 1777 with numerous children.

On 6 July 1790, Eliott died at the Schloss Kalkofen, Aachen, of palsy / stroke, allegedly brought on by drinking too much of the local mineral water, and was initially buried in the grounds of the Schloss. His personal estate was probated by 27 July and his furniture sold off by his heirs. Later in 1790, his body was disinterred and reburied at Heathfield, East Sussex. Later still, his body was again disinterred and reburied at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Buckland Monachorum, Devon in the church associated with his wife&#x27;s Drake ancestry.

==Legacy and monuments==
General Eliott has been commemorated on a Gibraltar pound banknote; his portrait has appeared since 1995 on the £10 notes issued by the Government of Gibraltar.

In August and September 1787, George&#x27;s portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds and now resides in the National Gallery. A painting entitled &quot;The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782&quot; by John Singleton Copley survive from 1787 in the Guildhall Art Gallery, and another Copley painting this time a head portrait is (link ), currently in the National Portrait Gallery. Another American artist John Trumbull created the well known portrait &quot;The Sortie Made by the Garrison of Gibraltar&quot; which resides in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His portrait was also painted by Mather Brown in 1788.

His marble monument and statue exist in the south transept of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. A bust of Elliot created in 1858 stands in the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens. A bronze medal &quot;George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield&quot; was created by Jean-Pierre Droz.

There are various pubs throughout England that honour his name; including the General Eliott in Willoughby Waterleys, Leicestershire, on the Grand Union Canal at Uxbridge, and another in the village of South Hinksey, Oxfordshire.

He is mentioned in Robert Burns&#x27;s cantata &quot;The Jolly Beggars&quot; as an inspiring figure. The old soldier singing the air &quot;I Am a Son of Mars&quot; says: &quot;Yet let my country need me, with Elliot [sic] to head me, / I&#x27;d clatter on my stumps at the sound of a drum.&quot;

<text>The Congo national football team (Kikongo: &quot;Ekipe ya nkweso ya nsi ya Kongo&quot;) represents the Republic of the Congo in men&#x27;s association football and is governed by the Congolese Football Federation. They have never qualified for the World Cup, but did win the Africa Cup of Nations in 1972. They also won the All-Africa Games football tournament in 1965. The team is also a member of both FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

== History ==
The Congo national football team made its first ever appearance in February 1960 in a friendly against the Ivory Coast which they lost 4–2. On 13 April, they defeated Reunion 4–1 in their first game to advance to the quarter-finals. In their quarter-final on 15 April, they defeated the Ivory Coast 3–2. On 17 April, they lost 5–4 to Cameroon and were beaten 8–1 by the host Madagascar in the third-place play-off on 19 April.

In April 1963 they entered another &quot;L&#x27;Amitié&quot; competition, this time in Senegal, and were drawn in a group with Tunisia, the Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo and Mauritania. They lost their opener 2–0 to Tunisia on 13 April but beat the Ivory Coast 3–2 the next day. On 15 April they beat their neighbour Congo Kinshasa 2–1, and then Mauritania 11–0 two days later, but did not advance to the next round.

In July 1965 the Congo held the 1965 All-Africa Games and were drawn in a group with Mali, Uganda and Togo. They drew 1–1 with Mali on 18 July and beat Uganda 2–1 the next day. On 21 July they drew 1–1 against Togo but advanced through to the semi-finals, where they beat the Ivory Coast 1–0 on 23 July. On 25 July the Congo drew 0–0 versus Mali in the final, but won the tournament by having won ten corners in the final compared to Mali&#x27;s one.

On 11 January 1967 the Congo played their first non-African opposition, defeating Romania 1–0 in a home friendly. On 19 February 1967 the Congo travelled to Tunisia for their first ever African Cup of Nations qualifier, drawing 1–1. On 2 August 1967 they hosted a qualifier against Cameroon, and defeated them 2–1 to top their qualifying group and advance to their first finals.

The finals were held in Ethiopia in January 1968 and the Congo were drawn in a group with their neighbour Zaire, Senegal and Ghana. They lost the opener to Zaire 3–0 on 12 January and two days later lost 2–1 to Senegal. On 16 January the Congo were defeated 3–1 by Ghana and were knocked out.

The Congo hosted a friendly against Romania for the second successive year on 16 June 1968 and won 4–2. On 30 July 1968 they played their first ever South American opposition, losing a home friendly 2–0 to Brazil.

In 1972, the Congo won their only African Cup of Nations title. Congo defeated host Cameroon in the semi-final 1–0 before beating Mali 3–2 to claim the championship. On that squad was arguably Congo&#x27;s most famous player, François M&#x27;Pelé, who starred for PSG in the 1970s.

In qualification for the 1998 World Cup, the Congo came within a win of qualifying for the final tournament. However, after home wins over Zambia, DR Congo and South Africa, Congo lost their final match 1–0 away to South Africa and was eliminated.

<doc id="1047786" wikidata="Q1441598" url="?curid=1047786" title="Osterley Park">
<text>Osterley Park is a Georgian country estate in west London, which straddles the London boroughs of Ealing and Hounslow. Originally dating from the 1570s, the estate contains a number of Grade I and II listed buildings, with the park listed as Grade II*. The main building (Osterley House) was remodelled by Robert Adam between 1761 and 1765. The National Trust took charge of Osterley in 1991, and the house and park are open to visitors.

==History==
===Early history===
The original building on this site was a manor house built in the 1570s for banker Sir Thomas Gresham, who purchased the manor of Osterley in 1562. The &quot;faire and stately brick house&quot; was completed in 1576. It is known that Elizabeth I visited. The stable block from that period remains at Osterley Park. Gresham, the founder of the Royal Exchange, also bought the neighbouring Manor of Boston in 1572.

===Acquisition by the Child family===
During the late 17th century, the estate was owned by Nicholas Barbon, a developer who mortgaged it to Child&#x27;s Bank and then died in debt around 1698. As a result of a mortgage default, by the early 1710s, the estate came into the ownership of Sir Francis Child, the founder of Child&#x27;s Bank. In 1761, Sir Francis&#x27;s grandsons, Francis and Robert, employed Scottish architect Robert Adam (who was just emerging as one of the most fashionable architects in Britain) to remodel the house. When Francis Child died in 1763, the project was taken up by his brother and heir, Robert Child, for whom the interiors were created.

The house is of red brick with white stone details and is approximately square, with turrets in the four corners. Adam&#x27;s design, which incorporates some of the earlier structure, is highly unusual, and it differs greatly in style from the original construction. One side is left almost open and is spanned by an Ionic pedimented screen, which is approached by a broad flight of steps and leads to a central courtyard, which is at &quot;piano nobile&quot; level.
Adam&#x27;s neoclassical interiors are among his most notable sequences of rooms. Horace Walpole described the drawing room as &quot;worthy of Eve before the fall&quot;. The rooms are characterised by elaborate but restrained plasterwork, rich, highly varied colour schemes, and a degree of coordination between decor and furnishings unusual in English neoclassical interiors. Notable rooms include the entrance hall, which has large semi-circular alcoves at each end, and the Etruscan dressing room, which Adam said was inspired by the &quot;Etruscan&quot; vases (as they were then regarded, now recognised as Greek) in Sir William Hamilton&#x27;s collection, illustrations of which had recently been published. Adam also designed some of the furniture, including the opulent domed state bed, which is still in the house.

===After Robert Child===
Robert Child&#x27;s only daughter, Sarah, married John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, in 1782. When Child died two months later, his will placed his vast holdings, including Osterley, in trust for any second-to-be born grandchild. This proved to be Lady Sarah Fane, who was born in 1785.

Child&#x27;s will kept his property out of the hands of John Fane, his son-in-law. Under the doctrine of coverture then in force, if Child had given his daughter more than a life interest in any property, Fane would have had control of it. Fane had eloped with Child&#x27;s daughter to Gretna Green, as Child had not consented to the marriage. Child had wished his daughter to marry someone willing to take on the Child surname and ensure its continuation.

Child&#x27;s eventual heiress, Lady Sarah Fane, married George Villiers in 1804 and, having children, the estate passed into the Villiers family. In 1819, George Villiers changed his surname to Child Villiers.

=== Later history ===
George Child Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey, opened Osterley to the public in 1939 after having received many requests from people wishing to see its historic interior. He justified his decision by saying that it was &quot;sufficient answer that he did not live in it and that many others wished to see it&quot;. Some 12,000 people visited the house during its first month of opening. Villiers staged a series of exhibitions of artworks by living artists in the top-floor rooms to contrast with the 18th-century interiors on the ground floor. He also planned to create an arboretum in the grounds, although that never came to fruition.

====Home Guard training establishment====
The grounds of Osterley Park were used for the training of the first members of the Local Defence Volunteers (forerunners of the Home Guard) when the 9th Earl, a friend of publisher Edward George Warris Hulton, allowed writer and military journalist Captain Tom Wintringham to establish the first Home Guard training school (which Hulton sponsored) at the park in May–June 1940. It included teaching the theory and practice of modern mechanical warfare, guerilla-warfare techniques and street-fighting techniques, making use of some estate workers&#x27; houses that had been scheduled for demolition.

Painter Roland Penrose taught camouflaging here, an extension of work he had developed with the paintbrush in avant-garde paintings to protect the modesty of his lover, Elizabeth &#x27;Lee&#x27; Miller (married to Aziz E. Bey). Wilfred Vernon taught the art of mixing home-made explosives, and his explosives store can still be seen at the rear of the house, while Canadian Bert &quot;Yank&quot; Levy, who had served under Wintringham in the Spanish Civil War, taught knife fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Despite winning world fame in newsreels and newspaper articles around the world (particularly in the US), the school was disapproved of by the War Office and Winston Churchill, and it was taken over in September 1940. Closed in 1941, its staff and courses were reallocated to other newly opened War Office-approved Home Guard schools.

====National Trust====
After the Second World War, Lord Jersey approached Middlesex County Council, which had shown interest in buying the estate, but eventually decided to give the house and its park to the National Trust. The furniture was sold to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. In 1947, Lord Jersey moved to the island of Jersey, taking with him many pictures from the collection at Osterley. Some were destroyed in a warehouse fire on the island soon after. Lord Jersey assisted the Ministry of Works and the V&amp;A in their restoration of the house to its present late-18th-century state.

The National Trust took charge of Osterley in 1991. The house has enjoyed loans and gifts from Lord Jersey, including items of silver, porcelain, furniture and miniatures. The trust commissioned portraits of Lord Jersey and his wife by Howard J. Morgan, which hang upstairs. In 2014, William Villiers, 10th Earl of Jersey, the present Earl, arranged a ten-year loan to Osterley of portraits of the Child family. The pictures that are part of the loan include Allan Ramsay&#x27;s portrait of Francis Child (1758), and George Romney&#x27;s portrait of Francis&#x27;s brother, Robert.

The house and small formal gardens are open to the public. They account for 30,000 paying visitors per year. Many hundreds of thousands of visitors per year walk the footpaths and enjoy the woodland of the surrounding park at no cost. A weekly 5k Parkrun takes place in the park.

The house saw its latest restoration from 2018 to 2021. This repaired structural deterioration and discolouring of the external brickwork.

<text>Bialystok University of Technology () is the largest technical university in northeast Poland.

The beginnings of Białystok University of Technology date back to 1949, when the Private Evening College of Engineering of the Polish Federation of Engineering Associations (FSNT-NOT) was established in Bialystok.

Today Białystok University of Technology employs more than 620 academic educators and provides graduate courses for more than 7,000 students at six faculties.

The study plans at the BUT are consulted with the biggest employers in the region, and the students complete their internships and work placements in partner firms as early as during their studies. A great majority of the BUT&#x27;s graduates find jobs within the first year after graduation.

Białystok University of Technology cooperates with many academic centres all over the world and has over 500 active bilateral agreements in scientific and educational cooperation with foreign partners (more information IRO BUT).

Białystok University of Technology has continuously been developing its scientific and teaching infrastructure. The last years were an unprecedented investment period for Bialystok University of Technology. The university gained four new facilities: the Centre for Modern Education, the Research and Education Centre of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, the INNO-EKO-TECH Innovative Research and Education Centre for Alternative Energy Sources, and Energy-efficient Construction and Environmental Protection.

The university campus is located almost at the heart of the town and has easy access to all especially in terms of advance technologies. 

== History ==
In 1949, Białystok, far away from its former glory, is rising from its post-war ruins. The once delightful tenement houses have burnt to ashes. The town needs to be rebuilt. The needs are enormous, the deficiencies even greater. Not only has the war deprived Białystok of its buildings but – above all – of its people, including professionals and specialists. The need to educate local engineers to rebuild the town and its former industry gives rise to the Private Evening College of Engineering in Bialystok (Polish: Prywatna Wieczorowa Szkoła Inżynierska NOT w Białymstoku) – the present Bialystok University of Technology.

<text>Lars Olsson Smith (12 October 1836 in Kiaby – 9 December 1913 in Karlskrona), also L.O. Smith, was a Swedish spirits manufacturer and politician. He was called &quot;The King of Spirits&quot; (&quot;Brännvinskungen&quot;) because of his domination of spirits production in Stockholm during the end of the 19th century. He started the production of &quot;Absolut Rent Brännvin&quot; which was later renamed Absolut Vodka.

==Biography==

At the age of 8, Lars Olsson got a position in a general store in Karlshamn after his father&#x27;s bankruptcy and was so well treated by his foster father consul Carl Smith that he took the name Smith. From 1850, he had employment in Stockholm first in the general store, then with a shipping agent. In 1858, he established an agency for a number of distilleries in Scania and Blekinge as well as a modern facility on Reimersholme. The distilleries Smith installed there made him rich by producing spirits with an unusually low fusel alcohol value. The most well known was the &quot;tiodubblat renat&quot; (&#x27;ten times purified&#x27;) which ran the communal distilleries out of business. Smith, as a result, faced reprisals from the city of Stockholm and relocated to Reimersholme, outside the city limits. He sold the product from the Fjäderholmarna islands, from which he had boats transport the alcohol to Stockholm.

In 2011, a memorial stone was erected in Kiaby, the village where Smith was born.

<text>Cendant Corporation was an American provider of business and consumer services, primarily within the real estate and travel industries. In 2005 and 2006, it broke up and spun off or sold its constituent businesses. Although it was based in New York City, the majority of its headquarters employees were in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey.

Its last CEO was Henry Silverman.

==History==

===Founding===
Hospitality Franchise Systems Inc. (HFS) was created as an affiliate of the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, as a vehicle to acquire hotel franchises. It was led by Henry Silverman, a Blackstone partner and former CEO of Days Inn. It began in 1990 by buying Howard Johnson&#x27;s and the U.S. rights to the Ramada brand from Prime Motor Inns for $170 million. In 1992, HFS bought the Days Inn franchise out of bankruptcy for $290 million. This purchase made HFS the largest hotel franchisor in the world, with its brands licensed to 2,300 hotels.

Blackstone took Hospitality Franchise Systems public in a December 1992 IPO. HFS was among the fastest growing companies of its size in the 1990s and the company&#x27;s stock rose from its IPO price of $4 per share to $77 per share in 1998.

In 1993, HFS purchased the Super 8 brand, franchised to 1,000 motels, for $125 million, and bought the 61-hotel Park Inn brand. The company made a brief foray into the casino industry, but then spun off that business in November 1994 as National Gaming. In 1995, HFS launched a new hotel brand, Wingate Inn.

After company management found that they had mostly exhausted the field of desirable acquisition targets in the hotel industry, Hospitality Franchise Systems expanded into the real estate business. Silverman hoped that HFS&#x27;s skills at franchise management would bring success in fields outside of hospitality. In August 1995, it acquired Century 21, a franchised chain of brokerages, from MetLife for $200 million. The company changed its name to HFS Inc. the same month, to reflect its broadened scope. This was followed the next year with the acquisition of Electronic Realty Associates for $37 million, and Coldwell Banker for $740 million, making HFS the largest franchisor of real estate brokerages in the U.S.

In 1996, HFS acquired the Avis car rental company for $793 million. In keeping with HFS&#x27;s strategy of being primarily a franchisor, it kept ownership of the Avis brand name and reservations system, while selling off the operations of Avis&#x27;s corporate-owned locations as a new company, Avis Rent a Car, Inc. HFS also bought Resort Condominiums International, a timeshare exchange service, for up to $825 million.

In 1997, HFS acquired PHH Corp. for $1.8 billion. PHH&#x27;s businesses of mortgage brokerage, relocation services, and fleet management were expected to synergize with HFS&#x27;s real estate and car rental businesses.

However, later that year, Silverman led HFS into what would prove a disastrous merger with CUC International, a direct marketing company that operated discount membership programs like Shoppers Advantage and Travelers Advantage. HFS and CUC combined in a &quot;merger of equals&quot; on December 18, 1997, to form Cendant Corporation. As part of the merger, Silverman announced he would reduce his day-to-day involvement with the company and assume the company&#x27;s chairmanship in preference of CUC&#x27;s founder and CEO Walter Forbes.

In January 1998, Cendant purchased Jackson Hewitt, a franchised chain of tax preparation offices, for $480 million.

===Accounting scandal===
Just months after the merger, in April 1998 Cendant uncovered massive accounting improprieties at CUC which resulted in one of the largest financial scandals of the 1990s. At the time, Vice Chairman E. Kirk Shelton was reported to have inflated the company&#x27;s revenue by $500 million over a period of three years. He had reported a 1997 net income of $55.4 million when the true 1997 result was a net loss of $217.2 million. As these irregularities in the books of Cendant were discovered in early 1998, an audit committee set up by Cendant&#x27;s Board of Directors launched an investigation and discovered that the former management team of CUC, including its top executives Walter Forbes and Kirk Shelton, had been fraudulently preparing false business statements for several years. When this report was released to the public, the resulting damage to the market value for the company was approximately $14 billion, with their stock tumbling from a high of $41 down to nearly $12. At the time, this fiasco was the largest case of accounting fraud in the country&#x27;s history. After the accounting scandal was uncovered, Silverman and the Cendant board forced Forbes’ resignation and Silverman assumed the CEO post.

In March 2001, Forbes and Shelton were indicted by a federal grand jury and sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the company of directing the massive accounting fraud that ultimately cost the company and its investors billions of dollars. Shelton served 8 of his 10-year prison sentence before being released early for exemplary behavior. Former CEO Walter Forbes was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2007.

Under Silverman, Cendant bounced back from the accounting scandal far outperforming the markets in the early 2000s.

===Post-scandal===
Following the fraud debacle, Cendant began selling businesses to reduce its debt and repair the financial damage caused by the accounting scandal. In 1998 the company sold Hebdo Mag, a publisher of classified advertising publications, for $450 million to a management buyout group. In 1999 it sold its consumer software division, Cendant Software (consisting of Blizzard Entertainment, Davidson &amp; Associates, Knowledge Adventure, and Sierra On-Line), to French publisher Havas for $770 million.

By 2001, Cendant was again in acquisition mode. It re-acquired the operations of Avis Rent a Car for $937 million. It made moves towards building a major online travel portal by acquiring Galileo International for $2.9 billion, and Cheap Tickets for $425 million. It entered the timeshare sales and management business by buying Fairfield Communities for $690 million, and Trendwest Resorts for $980 million. In 2002, Cendant bought Budget Rent a Car out of bankruptcy for $110 million plus $2.8 billion in assumed debt. The combination of Budget with Avis made Cendant the second-largest car rental company in the U.S.

In 2004, Cendant began a series of moves to simplify its business and focus on its core areas of real estate and travel.

As part of this strategy, several non-core businesses were sold or spun off. In June 2004, Cendant sold Jackson Hewitt for $638 million through an initial public offering. In January 2005, Cendant spun off its mortgage and fleet management businesses as PHH Corporation. The next month, Cendant sold its Wright Express division, a provider of fleet cards, for $1.03 billion through an initial public offering. In October 2005, Cendant sold its marketing services division, including its membership shopping programs, to Affinion Group, a vehicle of Apollo Management, for $1.8 billion.

Meanwhile, proceeds from these sales were used for acquisitions to expand Cendant&#x27;s core businesses. In November 2004, Cendant purchased Orbitz, the third-largest travel booking site in the U.S., for $1.2 billion. In December 2004, Cendant consolidated its control of the Ramada name by buying out Marriott International&#x27;s stake in the hotel brand. In February 2005, Cendant acquired Ebookers, the second-largest travel booking site in Europe, for $350 million. In April 2005, Cendant acquired Gullivers Travel Associates, a British seller of travel packages and wholesale hotel nights, for $1.1 billion. In October 2005, the company bought the Wyndham hotel brand from Blackstone for $111 million.

=== Breakup ===
On October 23, 2005, Cendant&#x27;s strategy of simplification culminated in the announcement that it would split into four separate companies, focused respectively on hotels, real estate, travel services, and rental cars. Silverman said the breakup would improve shareholder value by allowing the market to better recognize the value of Cendant&#x27;s component businesses.

Cendant originally planned to spin off its travel services division to shareholders as a company named Travelport, but on June 30, 2006, Cendant announced it would sell Travelport to Blackstone for $4.3 billion.

On July 31, 2006, Cendant&#x27;s real estate and hotel divisions were spun off and became separate companies under the names Realogy and Wyndham Worldwide, respectively.

The sale of Travelport to Blackstone was completed on August 23, 2006. This left Cendant with only its car rental business, comprising Avis, Budget Rent a Car, and Budget Truck Rental. The company retired the Cendant name and renamed itself to Avis Budget Group on September 1, 2006.

== Former brands ==

=== Automobile rentals ===

Cendant owned the rental brands of Avis and Budget, holding these properties in the CCRG (Cendant Car Rental Group). Avis and Budget operate a shared fleet of cars, and have the same &quot;back end&quot; system, but operate at different locations, offer different service levels, and have somewhat different pricing. After the Cendant name was dissolved, the car rental segment became known as Avis Budget Group and currently trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol CAR.

<doc id="1047803" wikidata="Q7188089" url="?curid=1047803" title="PhreakNIC">
<text>PhreakNIC is an annual hacker and technology convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. It is organized by the Nashville 2600 Organization and draws upon resources from SouthEastern 2600 (se2600). The Nashville Linux User Group was closely tied with PhreakNIC for the first 10 years, but is no longer an active participant in the planning. First held in 1997, PhreakNIC continues to be a long-time favorite among hackers, security experts and technology enthusiasts. PhreakNIC currently holds claim as the oldest regional hacker con and is one of the few hacker cons run by a 501(c)(3) tax-free charity. The conference attracts about 350 attendees.

PhreakNIC consists of presentations on a variety of technical subjects, sometimes related to a conference theme. There is also a film room showing anime and technology-related videos from popular culture. The Nashville Linux Users Group held a Linux Installfest from PhreakNIC 3 through PhreakNIC X.

PhreakNIC is attended by hackers and other technology enthusiasts from across the United States, although, as a regional conference, most of its attendees come from a two-state radius around Tennessee, including groups from Missouri, Ohio, Washington, DC, Georgia, Kentucky, and Alabama.

As PhreakNIC has been held in downtown Nashville, near the Tennessee Titans stadium, the exact date for PhreakNIC was previously not announced each year until the NFL released its schedule in April. PhreakNIC is intentionally scheduled not to coincide with a Titans home game, to give conference organizers full reign over the venue. However, PhreakNIC is typically held around the time of Halloween.

<doc id="1047827" wikidata="Q854576" url="?curid=1047827" title="Game of Death">
<text>Game of Death () is an incomplete Hong Kong martial arts film, of which portions were filmed between September and October 1972, and was planned and scheduled to be released by 1973, directed, written, produced by and starring Bruce Lee. The project was paused to film and produce &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. For &quot;Game of Death&quot;, over 120 minutes of footage was shot. The remaining footage has since been released with Lee&#x27;s original Cantonese and English dialogue, with John Little dubbing Lee&#x27;s Hai Tien character as part of the documentary titled &quot;Bruce Lee: A Warrior&#x27;s Journey&quot;. Much of the footage that was shot is from what was to be the climax of the film.

During filming, Lee received an offer to star in &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, the first kung fu film to be produced by a Hollywood studio (Warner Bros.), and with a budget unprecedented for the genre ($850,000). Lee died of cerebral edema before the film&#x27;s release. At the time of his death, he had made plans to resume the filming of &quot;The Game of Death&quot;. After Lee&#x27;s death, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; director Robert Clouse was enlisted to finish the film using two stand-ins; it was released in 1978 as &quot;Game of Death&quot;, five years after Lee&#x27;s death, by Golden Harvest.

The story of Lee&#x27;s original 1972 film involves Lee&#x27;s character, in order to save his younger sister and brother, joining a group of martial artists who are hired to retrieve a stolen Chinese national treasure from the top floor of a five-story pagoda in South Korea, with each floor guarded by martial artists who must be defeated while ascending the tower. The 1978 film&#x27;s plot was altered to a revenge story, where the mafia attempts to kill Lee&#x27;s character, who fakes his death and seeks vengeance against those who tried to kill him. The final part of the film uses some of Lee&#x27;s original film footage, but with the pagoda setting changed to a restaurant building, where he fights martial artists hired by the mafia in an attempt to rescue his fiancée Ann Morris (played by Colleen Camp). This revised version received a mixed critical reception but was commercially successful, grossing an estimated worldwide.

It was an influential film that had a significant cultural impact. The original version&#x27;s concept of ascending a tower while defeating enemies on each level was highly influential, inspiring numerous action films and video games. The film is also known for Lee&#x27;s iconic yellow-and-black jumpsuit as well as his fight scene with NBA player and student Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, both of which have been referenced in numerous media.

==Original film==
===Plot===
The original plot involves Lee playing the role of Hai Tien (海天), a retired champion martial artist who is confronted by Korean underworld gangs. They tell him the story of a pagoda where guns are prohibited. The pagoda is under heavy guard by highly skilled martial artists; they are protecting a stolen Chinese national treasure (which is not identified at all in any surviving material) held on its top level.

The gang boss wants Hai to be a part of a group of martial artists he assembled, to help retrieve said item by fighting the guardians. This is the boss&#x27;s second team he&#x27;s sending; the first team he sent was nearly wiped out. They force the reluctant Hai to participate by abducting his two younger siblings. Along with four other martial artists (two played by James Tien and Chieh Yuan), Hai battles his way up a five-level pagoda. The team encounters a different, and stronger, challenge on each floor.

As originally scripted by Lee, Hai and company enter the temple grounds, where at the pagoda&#x27;s base, they fight 10 Karate black belts. Inside the pagoda, Hai&#x27;s team encounters a different opponent on each floor, each one more formidable than the last. The other fighters assisting Hai are handily defeated by the pagoda guardians, as they&#x27;re not as skilled as Hai; the guardian in turn must be defeated by Hai.

At the pagoda raid, Hai&#x27;s group was to fight 25 floor guardians: 
* Bolo Yeung (sensei), Lam Ching-ying, Yuen Wah, Unicorn Chan, Bee Chan, Wu Ngan, and 14 others as The Twenty Black-Belt Karate Fighters – Ground Floor Guardians (has never been filmed)
* Hwang In-shik as Korean Hapkido Master #1 – 1st Floor Guardian, (only Ground Floor footage)
* Taky Kimura as Praying Mantis-style Shih-fu – 2nd Floor Guardian (also has never been filmed)
* Dan Inosanto as Eskrima Filipina – 3rd Floor Guardian
* Ji Han-jae as Korean Hapkido Master #2 – 4th Floor Guardian
* Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Mantis – 5th Floor Guardian

Hai would defeat all 25 formidable masters after his follow raiders were taken down by each master of the floor, the last one being James Tien&#x27;s character. He&#x27;s beaten by the final guardian (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), a giant fighter who fights with a free and fluid fighting style similar to Hai&#x27;s Jeet Kune Do. Because of the guardian&#x27;s great size and strength, in addition to his potent martial artistry, he can only be defeated when Hai recognizes and exploits his greatest weakness: an unusually high sensitivity to light.

Immediately after defeating the giant guardian, Hai turns around and descends the staircase...heading out of the pagoda. Despite all the talk of something awaiting up top of the (now unguarded) flight of stairs, there is no mention of anyone going up to retrieve it. No surviving material explains how this affects Hai or his captive siblings.

===Production===
Although the pagoda was supposed to have five floors, complete scenes were only shot for three of the floors: the &quot;Temple of the Tiger&quot;, where Lee faced Inosanto; the &quot;Temple of the Dragon&quot;, where he fought Ji Han-jae; and the final floor, known as the &quot;Temple of the Unknown&quot;, where he fought Abdul-Jabbar. Hapkido master Hwang In-shik was slated to play the guardian of the first floor, a master of a kick-oriented style, while Bruce&#x27;s long-time student and good friend Taky Kimura was asked to play the guardian of the second floor, a stylist of praying mantis kung fu.

The goal of the film&#x27;s plot was to showcase Lee&#x27;s beliefs regarding the principles of martial arts. As each martial artist is defeated (including Lee&#x27;s allies), the flaws in their fighting style are revealed. Some, like Dan Inosanto&#x27;s character, rely too much on fixed patterns of offensive and defensive techniques, while others lack economy of motion. Lee defeats his opponents by having a fighting style that involves fluid movement, unpredictability, and an eclectic blend of techniques. His dialogue often includes comments on their weaknesses.

===&quot;Bruce Lee: A Warrior&#x27;s Journey&quot;===
Several years later, Bruce Lee historian John Little released &quot;Bruce Lee: A Warrior&#x27;s Journey&quot;, a documentary revealing the original footage and storyline of &quot;The Game of Death&quot;. The documentary also includes a fairly in-depth biography of Lee and leads into the filming of &quot;The Game of Death&quot;. Originally meant to be a documentary in its own right, it can now be found on the second disc of the 2004 Special Edition DVD release of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, along with the documentary &quot;Bruce Lee: The Curse of the Dragon&quot;.

===&quot;Bruce Lee in G.O.D: Shibōteki Yūgi&quot;===
In 2000, the Japanese film &quot;&quot; was released on DVD. This film shows Lee&#x27;s original vision of the film through the existing footage that was shot for the film before he died, interviews, and historical re-enactments of what went on behind the scenes. A &quot;special edition&quot; DVD was released in 2003.

==&quot;Game of Death&quot; (1978 film)==
Game of Death is a 1978 Hong Kong action film co-written (under the pseudonym &quot;Jan Spears&quot; alongside Raymond Chow) and directed by Robert Clouse, with action directed by Sammo Hung. The film stars Bruce Lee, with Kim Tai-jong and Yuen Biao as his stunt doubles, along with Gig Young, Dean Jagger, Colleen Camp, Robert Wall, Hugh O&#x27;Brian, Dan Inosanto, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mel Novak, Sammo Hung, Ji Han-jae and Casanova Wong.

===Plot===
The 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot involving a new character, Billy Lo (盧比利), struggling against a racketeering &quot;syndicate&quot; after gaining international success as a martial arts movie star. When Billy refuses to be intimidated by syndicate henchman Steiner and his gangs of thugs, syndicate owner Dr. Land orders his assassination to serve as an example to others.

Disguised as a stuntman, Land&#x27;s assassin, Stick (Mel Novak), sneaks onto the set of Billy&#x27;s new film, and shoots Billy during filming. A fragment of the bullet passes through Billy&#x27;s face, leaving him alive but in need of plastic surgery which alters his facial features. Billy takes the opportunity to fake his death and disguise himself, exacting revenge against those who wronged him one at a time. When the syndicate threatens and kidnaps his fiancée, Ann Morris (Colleen Camp), Billy is forced to come out of hiding to save her.

===Production===
The revised version of the film uses only 12 minutes and 41 seconds of the footage from the original &quot;The Game of Death&quot;, and for the vast majority of the film, the role of Billy Lo was shared by Korean taekwondo master Kim Tai-jong and Hong Kong martial arts actor Yuen Biao, and was voiced by Chris Kent. The plot of the film allowed Kim and Yuen to spend much of the film in disguises, usually involving false beards and large, dark sunglasses that obscured the fact that they bore little resemblance to Lee. Many scenes, including fight scenes, also included brief close-up bits of stock footage of the real Bruce Lee from his pre-&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; films, often only lasting a second or two. These clips are easily recognisable due to the difference in film quality between the old and new footage. At one point in the movie, real footage of Lee&#x27;s corpse in his open-topped casket is used to show the character Billy Lo faking his death. There is even a scene taking place in Billy&#x27;s dressing room where a cut-out of Lee&#x27;s face was taped to a mirror, covering the stand-in&#x27;s own face.

===Soundtrack===
The American score was composed by John Barry. The vocal theme song &quot;Will This Be The Song I&#x27;ll Be Singing Tomorrow?&quot; was sung by Colleen Camp.

====Critical reception====
This version of the film received a mixed critical reception, holding a 46% Rotten Tomatoes score. Criticism of the revised version included the inclusion of scenes that could be considered in bad taste, such as the incorporation of footage of Lee&#x27;s actual funeral. Another scene, often pointed out by critics of the film, involved a shot of Kim looking at himself in the mirror, with an obvious cardboard cut-out of Lee&#x27;s face pasted onto the mirror&#x27;s surface.

Upon its North American release, Cecilia Blanchfield in &quot;The Calgary Herald&quot; rated it three stars, praising the climactic fight scenes as &quot;Bruce Lee at his best&quot; while criticizing the &quot;abysmal&quot; writing and &quot;clumsily executed&quot; production up until then, calling the film a &quot;poor tribute to a remarkably talented man.&quot;

Bey Logan points out a few logic issues with the 1978 film. In order for the henchmen to remain low key, they should be wearing more casual clothes instead of the multicolored tracksuits seen at various parts of the film. But as a rationale, this explains why Lee wears the yellow tracksuit. Also, during the fight between Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the scene near the vase in Logan&#x27;s opinion appears to look choppy, along with the short fight with Hugh O&#x27;Brian. In the first half of the English version, during the fight sequences, Lee is seen to be beaten down instead of making short work of the henchmen.

&quot;Game of Death&quot; could be considered more accessible to Western audiences than Lee&#x27;s previous films. Compared to other Bruce Lee films like &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, and &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Game of Death&quot; has more Western characters and the story structure is more straightforward and less culturally specific to Asia.

==&quot;Game of Death Redux&quot; (2019)==
On 19 July 2019, timed with the 46th death anniversary of Bruce Lee, producer Alan Canvan premiered a newly edited version of Lee&#x27;s &quot;Game of Death&quot; at the Asian American/Asian Research Institute in New York City, with biographer Matthew Polly joining Canvan in discussing the film and answering audience questions. The &quot;Redux&quot; edit only uses footage shot during the original production, while combining the score composed by John Barry for the 1978 version. It also restores dialogues that were missing in the 1978 version of &quot;Game of Death&quot;.

The film was released as a special feature (standard definition) in The Criterion Collection&#x27;s Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films on 14 July 2020.

== &quot;The Final Game of Death&quot; (2023) ==
On 17 July 2023, Arrow Films released a 4K UHD/Blu-ray box set covering Bruce Lee&#x27;s films at Golden Harvest. Included in the set is a 223-minute documentary on the production of &quot;Game of Death&quot;. The documentary includes all two hours of footage shot for the project by Lee before his death, restored from an interpositive. The documentary also includes an assembly of the footage, alongside a newly filmed introduction to cover the plot elements that were never shot.

==Legacy==
===Other &quot;Game of Death&quot; films===
After the death of Bruce Lee, several studios exploited the situation by making their own versions of &quot;Game of Death&quot; based on what they had learned of the story from production stills and magazine articles. Some of these films pre-dated Robert Clouse&#x27;s official &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1978).
* The Game of Death! (1974)
* &quot;Goodbye Bruce Lee: His Last Game of Death&quot; (1975)
* &quot;Enter the Game of Death&quot; (1978)
* &quot;The True Game of Death&quot; (1979)
* &quot;Game of Death II&quot; (&quot;Tower of Death&quot;) (1981)
: Clouse&#x27;s film had a sequel in 1981, &quot;Game of Death II&quot;, a kung fu action mystery film directed by Ng See-yuen which used cut footage from Lee&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; to have him make an appearance in the beginning of the film, only to be killed off midway, allowing his on-screen brother to take on the role of protagonist. Aside from the international English dub giving the &quot;Bruce Lee&quot; character the name Billy Lo, this movie appears to have no connection with Clouse&#x27;s film.

Wong Jing&#x27;s film &quot;City Hunter&quot; has a similar premise for a scene. Jackie Chan as Ryu Saeba takes on two tall black men, and the film uses clips of Lee&#x27;s fight scene against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to get the better of the two.

===Influence===
The original film&#x27;s concept of ascending a tower while defeating enemies on each level was highly influential, inspiring numerous action films and video games.

====Film====
Italian film scholars Simone Bedetti and Lorenzo De Luca identified &quot;Game of Death&quot; as an early example of what they call the &quot;arcade movie&quot; genre of action films. These &quot;arcade movies&quot; have three characteristic elements: the achievement of a &quot;goal&quot;, passing a series of &quot;levels&quot;, and ascending through a &quot;path&quot; (whether physical or symbolic). This is presented in &quot;Game of Death&quot; as Lee going up higher floors while facing increasingly dangerous opponents as he ascends the tower. Later examples of action films which Bedetti and De Luca identify as &quot;arcade movies&quot; include Bruce Lee&#x27;s own &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, the Bruce Willis movie &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988), Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989), Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), and the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (1995).

&quot;The Raid&quot;, a 2011 Indonesian film, was influenced by &quot;Game of Death&quot;. It has a similar plot structure, set in a single main location, a grungy high-rise building, with grunts at the bottom and the big boss at the top. This &quot;Game of Death&quot; formula was also used in the film &quot;Dredd&quot; (2012) and appeared in an episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.

Several films pay homage to the fight scene between Bruce Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The scene is parodied in two Jackie Chan films, &quot;City Hunter&quot; (1993) where Chan fights two tall black men, and &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; (2007) which reverses it by having a shorter African-American man Chris Tucker fight a taller Chinese basketballer Sun Mingming. The Keanu Reeves film &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum&quot; (2019) pays homage in a scene featuring NBA basketball player Boban Marjanović. The French film &quot;La Tour Montparnasse Infernale&quot; (2001) parodies the scene when Ramzy Bedia fights with Bô Gaultier de Kermoal, wearing the same costumes as Lee and Abdul-Jabbar.

William Zabka referenced &quot;Game of Death&quot; during his audition for the role of Johnny Lawrence in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), when the director John Avildsen asked him &quot;how old are you? You&#x27;re a little bigger than our karate kid.&quot; Zabka responded, &quot;Bruce Lee was smaller than Kareem Abdul Jabbar, but he beat him&quot; in reference to &quot;Game of Death&quot;, to which Avlidsen responded &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s true.&quot; That convinced Avlidsen to cast Zabka for the role.

====Video games====
The plot structure of &quot;Game of Death&quot;, where a series of martial arts opponents each have a weakness that must be discovered and exploited, established the &quot;end-of-level boss&quot; structure used by beat &#x27;em up games for decades. This structure first crossed over into video games with the 1984 arcade game &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, which established the beat &#x27;em up genre. &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; was initially released as &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan, as a tie-in for the 1984 Jackie Chan film &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (titled &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan), before an international release as &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (sans &quot;Spartan X&quot; license). Its boss battle gameplay also became the basis for fighting games such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987). &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; also inspired &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), the Red Ribbon Army saga (1985–1986) in the manga and anime series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, and the French film &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; (1988).

====Comics====
The superhero Shang-Chi was created as a result of the kung-fu craze started by Bruce Lee in 1973, with artist Paul Gulacy using Lee as a visual inspiration for Shang-Chi. The &quot;Game of Rings&quot; storyline from the comic series &quot;Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings&quot; was inspired by &quot;Game of Death&quot;.

===Yellow-and-black jumpsuit===
The yellow-and-black jumpsuit which Lee wore in the film has come to be seen as something of a trademark for the actor, and is paid homage to in numerous other media. In the Clouse-directed remake, the filmmakers rationalised its presence by including a scene where Billy Lo disguises himself as one of Dr. Land&#x27;s motorcycle-riding thugs, who all wear striped jumpsuits.

In the warehouse scene, Billy Lo wears a pair of yellow Adidas shoes with black stripes and white shelltoes. Towards the end of the film, Billy wears a pair of yellow Onitsuka Tiger shoes, with black stripes. This is because the real Bruce Lee wore the latter when he was filming, and the double wore the former in the 1978 version to resemble his shoes.

In the Lee-directed unfinished version, the jumpsuit should portray personal freedom in the art of combat, without being bounded to a certain fighting style. The cinematic explanation for its presence was the nickname of Hai Tien, Yellow-Faced Tiger, because his fighting outfit and shoes resemble the colours of a Tiger. Over the years, there were many speculations about the colour of the jumpsuit and its meaning. According to Andre Morgan from Golden Harvest, they had a yellow suit with black bars and a black suit with yellow bars. Lee first chose the black suit, but changed it to the yellow because Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s footprints were better visible on it.

====Film====
* Uma Thurman wears a similar suit in &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; when she travels to Japan to take on an underworld boss and assassin played by Lucy Liu. In homage to both the film and the remake, Thurman wears a two-piece suit and the Onitsuka Tiger sneakers as part of her motorcycle-riding gear, and keeps the suit on during her battle with Liu and her gang, the Crazy 88.
* In &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot;, a similar suit is worn by the goalie &quot;Empty Hand&quot; (Danny Chan Kwok-kwan), who resembles Lee.
* In the Jet Li film &quot;High Risk&quot;, Jacky Cheung plays an action film star who is losing his fighting ability due to his cowardice and drunkenness. When he regains his courage at the end of the film, he wears a copy of the yellow tracksuit. The role is generally felt to be a parody of Jackie Chan, but the references to Bruce Lee are also obvious.
* The 1985 film &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;, produced by Motown founder Berry Gordy, centred around a Bruce Lee fan, portrayed by Taimak, in search of reaching martial arts enlightenment who instructed his students wearing the same tracksuit.
* In &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;, Brian Tochi&#x27;s character, Toshiro Takashi, wears the yellow jumpsuit while riding a tricycle during the inter-Greek competitions.
* In the live-action &quot;City Hunter&quot; film (directed by Wong Jing), the scene in which Jackie Chan dispatches his own taller opponents references Lee&#x27;s fight with Abdul-Jabbar.
* In &quot;Police Story 4: First Strike&quot;, Jackie Chan wears a similar suit that he gets from a wardrobe of an hotel room, claiming that he is a dry cleaner to the owner, with the same colors and the left and right black line.
* In &quot;Finishing the Game&quot;, Breeze Loo, played by Roger Fan, wears a yellow and black striped jumpsuit.
* In the 2011 British comedy film &quot;On the Ropes&quot;, writer and director Mark Noyce added a scene in homage to his idol Bruce Lee which featured Mick Western (played by Ben Shockley) wearing a yellow tracksuit.

====Music====
* A short promotional video for the virtual band Gorillaz showed the fictional animated guitarist Noodle taking on a pack of thugs while dressed in the tracksuit and imitating Lee&#x27;s fighting style. Noodle also wore the suit in the &quot;Game of Death&quot; short clip from &quot;Phase One: Celebrity Take Down&quot;.
* The band Sugar Ray, in their video for the single &quot;When It&#x27;s Over&quot;, included a segment in which one of its band members (Rodney Sheppard, Guitarist) fantasizes about having a kung fu battle similar to the fight scene between Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The band member wears Lee&#x27;s tracksuit, his opponent wears a beard, clothes and sunglasses similar to Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s, and the video duplicates the scene in which a seated Kareem kicks Lee in the chest, knocking him down and leaving a huge footprint on his chest.
* Avant-garde guitarist Buckethead released a cover of &quot;Game of Death&quot; in 2006. He also wore a yellow tracksuit while playing live and performed with nunchakus on stage.
* American band Far East Movement&#x27;s song &quot;Satisfaction&quot; featured the yellow jumpsuits in the song&#x27;s music video; said song was the soundtrack to the 2007 mockumentary &quot;Finishing the Game&quot;.
* Canadian hard rock duo Indian Handcrafts&#x27; song &quot;Bruce Lee&quot; uses the film as lyrical inspiration, while the music video features the two band members performing an over-the-top fight scene, with guitarist Daniel Brandon Allen wearing the signature yellow jumpsuit.
* In the music video for the Iggy Azalea song &quot;Black Widow&quot; (featuring Rita Ora), based on &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, Azalea wears a white &amp; black tracksuit and Ora wears a black &amp; red tracksuit. Both suits resemble Uma Thurman&#x27;s version of the tracksuit.
* In the video for Black Label Society&#x27;s 2009 song &quot;Overlord&quot;, frontman Zakk Wylde wears the iconic tracksuit, and the video pays humorous homage to the film.

====Manga and anime====
* In the &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; episode &quot;The Mendo Family&#x27;s Masquerade War&quot;, Ataru wears a yellow tracksuit with black stripes while trying to court Mendou&#x27;s sister, who is sporting nunchakus. Both Ataru&#x27;s yellow tracksuit and the Mendou sister&#x27;s nunchakus are a homage to Bruce Lee.
* In the anime/manga &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot;, there is a short appearance of a character named &quot;Inosato Dan&quot; who is the leader of the &quot;Jun Fan Gung Fu club&quot; (Jun Fan is Bruce Lee&#x27;s Chinese name). He resembles Bruce Lee very much, and wears the jumpsuit. However, in the anime the colors of the jumpsuit are switched to a black suit with yellow stripes.
* Duel No. 25 of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; manga features some references to Bruce Lee. Yugi&#x27;s fighting-game character of choice is a Bruce Lee clone called Bruce Ryu. His opponent, the villain of the chapter, wears the yellow jumpsuit and calls his fight with Jonouchi a &quot;Game of Death&quot;. The subsequent &quot;Death-T&quot; arc then follows a similar structure to the movie with Yugi fighting his way up to the top stage where he has a one on one bout with Seto Kaiba.
* The second episode of the anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Stray Dog Strut&quot;, further pays homage with the episode&#x27;s main antagonist being named Abdul Hakim (after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s character) and bearing a strikingly similar appearance.
* The character Mr. Tanaka from &quot;Sonic X&quot; wears the suit in an episode.

====Comics====
* Shang-Chi wore two different suits that were inspired by the yellow and black jumpsuit. The first one, which had a one time appearance in &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; #18 (2011), was a black tracksuit with red bars. Shang-Chi&#x27;s second suit, that he wore starting with &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 5 #1 (2012), was a modernized version of Lee&#x27;s tracksuit that was a red jumpsuit with a black pattern on the sides and chest.
* In &quot;Iron Fist: The Living Weapon&quot; #8 (2014), Iron Fist gained an updated suit that was modeled off Lee&#x27;s yellow and black tracksuit. The new suit was a black (green in some artwork) tracksuit with yellow bars, sported yellow Onitsuka Tiger shoes and included a yellow collar, mask and Iron Fist&#x27;s signature dragon insignia on the chest.

==Home media==
As one of Bruce Lee&#x27;s perennially popular handful of films to receive wide exposure to Western audiences, &quot;Game of Death&quot; has seen many reissues in every home video format. It is particularly widespread on DVD and Blu-ray and was released on the latter in a new 4K restoration in 2016, scanned from the original negative.

<text>Meal powder is the fine dust left over when black powder (gunpowder) is corned and screened to separate it into different grain sizes. It is used extensively in various pyrotechnic procedures, usually to prime other compositions. It can also be used in many fireworks to add power and substantially increasing the height of the firework. The powder has occasionally been used as a synonym for Serpentine powder, which it physically resembles.

&#x27;Mill meal&#x27; powder is a mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur in the correct proportions (75% potassium nitrate:15% charcoal:10% sulfur) which has been ball-milled to mix it intimately. It is used in the same way as commercial meal powder or can be pressed and corned to produce true black powder.

Meal powder is made by mixing the ingredients by mass, rather than volume. These ingredients are processed in a ball mill, basically a rotating drum with non-sparking ceramic or lead balls. The more time spent in the mill, the more effective the powder will be. One main reason to ball mill as opposed to other methods is because it presses sulfur and KNO3 into the porous charcoal.

<text>Fist of Fury () is a 1972 Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Lo Wei and produced by Raymond Chow. The film stars Bruce Lee in his major role after &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (1971). Bruce Lee also worked as the film&#x27;s action choreographer. In the film, Chen Zhen, a student of Huo Yuanjia, fights to defend the honor of the Chinese in the face of foreign aggression and also exact vengeance responsible for Huo&#x27;s death.

The film was Lee&#x27;s second kung fu film and also touched on sensitive issues surrounding Japanese colonialism. It also featured fairly realistic fight choreography for its time and also differs from other films in the genre for its historical and social references, especially to Japanese imperialism.

&quot;Fist of Fury&quot; grossed an estimated worldwide (equivalent to over adjusted for inflation) against a budget of $100,000. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film until Bruce Lee&#x27;s following film &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; (1972).

==Plot==
In 1908 Shanghai, Chen Zhen returns to Jingwu School to marry his fiancée Yuan Li&#x27;er, but Chen learns that his master Huo Yuanjia has died, apparently from illness, which devastates Chen. During the funeral, people from a Japanese dojo in Hongkou District arrive to taunt the Jingwu students. Wu En, translator and advisor for the Japanese dojo&#x27;s grandmaster Hiroshi Suzuki, taunts Chen by slapping him on the cheek several times and dares him to fight one of Suzuki&#x27;s protégés.

They present a sign to Jingwu School, bearing the words &quot;Sick Man of East Asia&quot;, seemingly to insult Huo Yuanjia, describing the Chinese as &quot;weaklings&quot; in comparison to the Japanese. The protégé taunts the Jingwu students to fight him and promises, &quot;I&#x27;ll eat those words if any Chinese here dare to fight and defeat me&quot;. Chen Zhen wants to retaliate, but is prevented by Fan Junxia, the most senior student in the school. Shortly afterwards, Chen Zhen goes to the Hongkou dojo alone to return the sign. He winds up fighting the Japanese students, defeating all of them, including their sensei, single-handedly. Chen smashes the glass on the sign and makes the students who taunted him earlier chew up the paper bearing the derogatory words, so as to make them literally &quot;eat their words&quot;.

Later, Chen takes a stroll to a park, but a Sikh guard refuses him entry, due to a posted sign that forbids dogs and Chinese in the park. After the guard allows a foreigner to bring her pet dog into the park, a Japanese man approaches Chen and tells him that if he behaves like a dog, Chen will be allowed to go in. Chen beats up the man and his friends in anger. After the fight, Chen breaks the sign. The guard blows his whistle to alert the police, but the citizens who watched the whole fight help Chen to escape the park. The Japanese students and their master retaliate by attacking Jingwu School on Suzuki&#x27;s orders. After causing severe damage, the Japanese students leave. Wu, accompanying the Japanese students, warns Jingwu School to hand over Chen.

Chen returns and realises that he has caused big trouble. His fellow students refuse to hand him over to the Japanese so they make plans to help him escape from Shanghai. That night, Chen discovers that Master Huo had actually been poisoned by Tian, the cook. Chen sees Tian and Feng Guishi, the caretaker, talking. Chen kills Tian, followed by Feng while trying to determine why they killed Master Huo. Chen hangs Tian and Feng&#x27;s bodies on a lamp post. Yuan Li&#x27;er finds him hiding near Huo&#x27;s grave and they share a passionate moment together.

Meanwhile, Suzuki forces Inspector Lo to arrest Chen, but he eludes them. While Suzuki is entertaining his visiting friend Petrov, Chen kills Wu and hangs his body on the lamp post. The angry Suzuki heads to the Japanese Consulate and reports Chen, then on Tian&#x27;s brother&#x27;s advice sends his men to Jingwu School to kill everyone inside. That same night, Chen barges into the dojo to take his revenge, killing the students&#x27; master, Yoshida, Petrov and Suzuki. Chen returns to Jingwu School and finds most from Jingwu School and the Hongkou dojo dead, but a few Jingwu students - among them Yuan, Fan Junxia and Xu - are still alive, as they had also been searching for Chen at the grave site, acting on a tip from Yuan.

Inspector Lo arrives at Jingwu to arrest Chen, who agrees to surrender himself to Lo to protect his master&#x27;s legacy. Lo tells Chen that he can always trust him since he is Chinese. As they exit the school, Chen faces a line of armed Japanese soldiers and Western policemen at the outer gate, all pointing their guns at him. Furious, Chen charges the line and makes a flying kick, whereupon the soldiers shoot him. As the shots are heard, the scene freezes while Chen is airborne.

==Production==
Jackie Chan appeared in &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, both as an extra and as a stunt double for the Japanese villain Hiroshi Suzuki (portrayed by Riki Hashimoto), particularly during the final fight scene where Lee kicks him and he flies through the air.

Lee was not a fan of the director or his direction. According to Jackie Chan, he saw Lo Wei and Bruce Lee get into a verbal altercation that nearly went physical. Lo Wei then hid behind his wife who was then able to calm Lee down.

==Title==
&quot;Fist of Fury&quot; was accidentally released in the U.S. under the title &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot;. That title was a means of tapping the popularity of another film, &quot;The French Connection&quot; (starring Gene Hackman), released in the U.S. in 1971. That title was intended to be used for the U.S. release of another Bruce Lee film, &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, which also involved drug smuggling. However, the U.S. titles for &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; and &quot;The Big Boss&quot; were accidentally switched, resulting in &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; being released in the U.S. under the title &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot; until 2005, while &quot;The Big Boss&quot; was released as &quot;Fists of Fury&quot;.

==Dubbing==
Media Asia UK distributor Hong Kong Legends has released this film as a &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; and a &quot;Platinum Edition&quot;. Bey Logan recorded two alternative commentaries for both releases. The usual process with re-releases on DVD is that the commentary is passed on to the next release. Logan decided to re-record his second commentary as he wanted to give it a new light, being an avid fan of this film. The re-dubbed theme song was played by Mike Remedios. Bey Logan had previously done a commentary track for the Media Asia Megastar DVD release, which is almost word for word the same as the commentary he did for Hong Kong Legends years later. Donnie Yen did the Cantonese language commentary on the same Megastar DVD.

In 2021, &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; was dubbed into Noongar, a native Australian dialect. It was the first film to be dubbed into said language.

==Release==
The film was released on 22 March 1972 in Hong Kong by Golden Harvest, and first released in the United States on 7 November 1972 in New York before Lee&#x27;s first major film, &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, was released there.

In Japan, the film was released on 20 July 1974. Several scenes in the Japanese version were censored due to Raymond Chow&#x27;s concerns over how the film&#x27;s anti-Japanese sentiments would be received by Japanese audiences.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Upon its Hong Kong release, &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; grossed 4,431,423, beating the previous box office record set by Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Big Boss&quot; in the previous year. During its initial run, it grossed more than in Southeast Asia and across Asia.

In the United States and Canada, the film topped the box office in June 1973, and earned in distributor rentals by the end of 1973, equivalent to an estimated box office gross revenue of approximately . Upon its July 1973 release in South Korea, the film sold 317,780 tickets in the capital city of Seoul. The film was also a success in the United Kingdom, where it released on 19 July 1973, a day before Lee&#x27;s death. In France, it became the 12th highest-grossing film of 1974 (below two other Lee films in the top ten, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot;), with 3,013,676 ticket sales. In Spain, the film sold 2,034,752 tickets.

In Japan, despite the film&#x27;s negative portrayal of Japanese villains, the film went on to be a surprise blockbuster in the country. Most Japanese audiences did not identify with the Japanese villains who they perceived as &quot;unreal&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; but instead identified with Lee&#x27;s &quot;Chinese warrior&quot; spirit which reminded them of the &quot;bushido&quot; spirit depicted in older Samurai cinema. &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; became the year&#x27;s seventh highest-grossing film in Japan, with in distributor rental earnings.

Against a tight budget of $100,000, the film went on to gross an estimated worldwide (equivalent to approximately adjusted for inflation), earning times its budget. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film up until Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; (1972).

===Critical response===
Upon release in Asia, a review for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in November 1972 called it a &quot;Naive Hong Kong-made meller, of little U.S. commercial appeal&quot; despite the &quot;charm of Lee&#x27;s invincible heroics.&quot; The reviewer felt that it was an &quot;exuberant novelty act&quot; unlikely to find Western appeal but that Lee&#x27;s &quot;aggressive boyish charm&quot; could &quot;prove appealing to U.S. femmes.&quot;

Upon release in North America, John Gillett of the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; reviewed a 106 minute dubbed version of the film in May 1973. Gillett commented on Bruce Lee stating that he had &quot;somewhat rudimentary and charmless acting style (all curled lips, sinister glances and clenched fists), but he performs his main function—that of keeping the action going through a series of furious karate fights—with considerable aplomb and proves as adept with his feet as with his fists.&quot; While finding the story &quot;extremely naive&quot; and that the &quot;anti-Japanese bias is more rather more pronounced&quot; while the fight sequences &quot;are staged with tremendous vigour (and a judicious use of slow-motion)&quot; concluding that &quot;the production values are only moderate, with a rather uneasy fusion of studio interiors and real street locations, and the English dubbing is unusually inept.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an aggregated review score of 83% based on 18 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on four critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film may have been the only one which Chairman Mao watched three times.

===Themes===
&quot;Fist of Fury&quot; deals with topics of injustice, grief, revenge and consequences. Chen Zhen goes through a great deal of grief after the death of his master. This grief eats away at Zhen as well as the injustice he and his peers deal with from the Japanese racism towards them. The movie shows Zhen going out to get revenge but the cost is dear, losing the majority of his peers and his freedom.

=== Home media ===
In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 600,000 viewers on Channel 5 in 2009, making it the year&#x27;s most-watched foreign-language film on Channel 5.

==Sequels and remakes==

The film spawned three sequels: One starring Jackie Chan titled &quot;New Fist of Fury&quot; (1976), followed by &quot;Fist of Fury II&quot; (1977), &quot;Fist of Fury III&quot; (1979), and the South Korean spin-off &quot;Last Fist of Fury&quot; (1979). 

The film also has comedy called &quot;Fist of Fury 1991&quot; (1991), and a loose remake titled &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; (1994) starring Jet Li. A year after, the film spawned the television series &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (1995) starring Donnie Yen as Chen Zhen. Donnie Yen reprised his role as Chen Zhen on the show’s 15th anniversary in &quot;Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen&quot; (2010).

<text>The Way of the Dragon (, originally released in the United States as Return of the Dragon) is a 1972 Hong Kong martial arts action comedy film co-produced and directed by Bruce Lee, who also stars in the lead role. This is Lee&#x27;s only complete directorial film and the last one released during his lifetime. The film co-stars Nora Miao, Robert Wall, Wei Ping-ou and Chuck Norris (playing his debut screen role). 

&quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; was released in Hong Kong on 30 December 1972, and in the United States in August 1974. The film went on to gross an estimated worldwide (equivalent to over adjusted for inflation), against a tight budget of $130,000, earning a thousand times its budget. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film up until Lee&#x27;s next film &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973).

The film is primarily set in a restaurant in Rome. The owners are being harassed by a local crime boss, and request help from a relative in Hong Kong. The help arrives in the form of a young martial artist. The conflict between the restaurant staff and the gangsters soon escalates.

==Plot==

In Rome, Chen Ching-hua and her uncle Wang experience trouble with their restaurant from a crime boss who wants their property. When Chen refuses to give it up, the boss sends gangsters there to scare away the customers. Appealing to an uncle in Hong Kong, Chen receives help in the form of a young martial artist Tang Lung. On his first arrival, Tang is disoriented by his new surroundings and appears to be a country bumpkin. Disappointed, Chen asks what help he can be, but Tang confidently assures her that he is capable enough. At the restaurant, Tang learns that the staff have begun to learn karate, much to the annoyance of Quen, an employee who favors kung fu. Tang advises Quen to be open-minded and make use of anything that works.

Before long, the gangsters appear at the restaurant and threaten the customers away while Tang is using the bathroom. Upset by Tang&#x27;s poor timing, the staff question his skill and the usefulness of his style. When the gangsters later return, the staff engage the thugs in a fight, only to be beaten. However, Tang single-handedly defeats them, causing the staff to decide to train under him. Uncle Wang warns them that the gangsters will seek revenge, but Tang vows to protect the restaurant. Chen and Tang grow closer and she takes him on a tour of Rome, though Tang is unimpressed by the city. 

Ho, the crime boss&#x27;s subordinate, returns with armed men and takes the restaurant staff hostage. Ho gives Tang a ticket to Hong Kong and tells him to go back. However, when his men escort Tang outside, Tang fights back and defeats the thugs with his two nunchakus, followed by the help of the restaurant staff. Tang warns Ho not to return and the thugs leave the restaurant. The staff celebrate their victory, but the gang boss threatens to have Tang killed unless he leaves by Chinese New Year. Uncle Wang urges Chen to convince Tang to leave. When Tang refuses to abandon the restaurant, an assassin tries to kill him from a nearby rooftop with a sniper rifle. Already fidgety from nearby fireworks, Tang survives the attempt. He then tracks down and defeats the assassin after tricking him into wasting his ammunition. When he returns to the apartment, he finds that Chen is gone. Assuming that Ho has kidnapped her, Tang goes to the boss&#x27; headquarters with the restaurant staff, defeating his men. Tang issues a final warning to the boss to leave the restaurant alone. The staff again celebrate, but a telegram for Tang cuts this short when they learn that he has been summoned back to Hong Kong. Tang assures them that he will not leave until the situation is resolved. 

Ho hires two Japanese and European karate masters to challenge Tang, as well as a world-class martial artist named Colt. He then leads some of the restaurant staff to an isolated spot under the pretence of a truce, where the two martial artists ambush them. They initially defeat the staff until Tang intervenes. Ho lures Tang away to fight Colt at the Colosseum. Left behind, Uncle Wang knifes the two remaining members of the staff as he wants to sell the restaurant to the crime boss and return to Hong Kong as a rich man. In a decisive ten-minute battle, Tang disables Colt and reluctantly kills him after Colt refuses an offer of mercy. Tang then chases after Ho out of the Colosseum. As Tang and Ho return to the ambush site, the mob boss arrives and shoots both Ho and Uncle Wang. Led by Chen, the police arrest the boss as he tries to kill Tang. With the matter finally resolved, Tang returns to Hong Kong, where Quen tells Chen that Tang is a loner who will never settle down.

==Production==
Bruce Lee formed his own production company, Concord Production Inc., with Golden Harvest founder Raymond Chow, and &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; was the company&#x27;s first film. As well as acting as its producer, Lee also wrote the script, directed the film and played percussion on the soundtrack.

The film was originally intended as only for the Asian market, but was ultimately &quot;responsible for maintaining the momentum of martial arts films in America&quot;. What makes it particularly memorable is the treatment of the fight in the Colosseum, with Chuck Norris making his film debut there. Lee filmed it &quot;in long takes, framing it so that you could see their entire bodies. He used dramatic lighting, making both of them look larger-than-life.&quot;

==Box office==
Prior to release, the film&#x27;s initial tight budget of US$130,000 was already covered by pre-sales in Taiwan alone. Upon release, the film earned 5,307,350.50 at the Hong Kong box office, beating previous records set by Lee&#x27;s own films, &quot;The Big Boss&quot; and &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, and making it the highest-grossing film of 1972 in Hong Kong. &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; went on to gross , making it the highest-grossing film ever in Hong Kong up until then.

In the United States and Canada, the film received a wide release in August 1974, topping the North American box office charts. In New York City alone, the film opened with earnings of more than in its first five days. At Chicago&#x27;s Oriental Theater, the film drew long queues before opening, setting an all-time theater record with 4,000 tickets sold within several hours of its opening. The film grossed within two weeks of release at the Oriental Theater. 

At two other Chicago theaters in Black neighbourhoods, the film earned in its opening week. At a number of theaters, the film drew loud cheers from Black audiences like a prizefight, particularly during the climactic fight where audiences cheered on Lee as he fought Chuck Norris. Within a month of its release, the film earned nearly in the United States. The film earned in US distributor rentals during its initial run. With later re-releases, the film went on to gross a total box office revenue of in the United States.

In France, it became the eighth highest-grossing film of 1974 (below &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; at #5 and above &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; at #12), with 4,002,004 ticket sales. In Spain, the film sold 2,345,259 tickets. In Germany, it was the 13th highest-grossing film of 1975, with ticket sales. In Japan, the film earned in distribution rentals, becoming the ninth highest-grossing film of 1975. In South Korea, the film sold 182,530 tickets in the capital city of Seoul. The film was also a commercial success in India when it released there in 1979. In one Bombay theater alone, New Excelsior, the film earned an estimated in its first eight weeks.

Against the film&#x27;s final budget of $130,000, the film initially grossed worldwide, before increasing its gross to and then by 1974. It eventually grossed an estimated total of (equivalent to approximately adjusted for inflation), earning times its budget. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film up until Lee&#x27;s next film, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973).

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; reported a 92% favourable critics&#x27; response, commenting on Lee&#x27;s work that it shows &quot;a surprising change of pace from his usual hard-hitting action fare because it favors humor as much as it does kung-fu&quot;. Upon release, Roger Ebert initially gave a mixed review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, saying he found the plot simplistic and its conventions unbelievable but commented that &quot;this sort of stuff is magnificently silly, and Lee, to give him credit, never tried to rise above it.&quot; Retrospective reviews have since been positive, with the film&#x27;s comedy elements compared favourably to Charlie Chaplin and Jackie Chan, while the final fight between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris is considered one of the greatest fight scenes of all time.

At the 11th Golden Horse Awards, it was judged a runner-up Best Feature Film and was recognised for Best Film Editing. Later on, it ranked #95 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. According to Gene Freese, the final fight between Lee and Norris is considered &quot;by many to be the greatest movie fight ever&quot; filmed. It has been listed as one of the greatest fight scenes of all time in a number of publications.
In 1978, following Lee&#x27;s death, an exploitation sequel was released titled &quot;Way of the Dragon 2&quot;, starring Bruce Le and Bolo Yeung.

During the fight scene between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris, Lee demonstrated and popularized a technique that would later be called the oblique kick. This technique is frequently used by several modern mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters, most notably the UFC pound-for-pound champion Jon Jones, who cited Lee as an inspiration.

<text>Sync sound (synchronized sound recording) refers to sound recorded at the time of the filming of movies. It has been widely used in movies since the birth of sound movies. 

==History==
Even in the silent film era, films were shown with sounds, often with musical accompaniment by a pianist or an orchestra keeping time with the screen action. The first synchronization was a turning recording device marked with a white spot. As the white spot rotated, the cameraman hand-cranked the camera to keep it in sync with the recording. The method was then repeated for playback, but with the projectionist hand cranking the film projector. &quot;Single-system&quot; sound recorded sound optically to part of the original camera film, or magnetically to a stripe of magnetic coating along the film edge. 

&quot;Double-system&quot; sound used independent cameras and sound recorders. The first sync sound standard used recorders and cameras both powered by AC (alternating current) motors - essentially clock motors. 

Later the 50 Hz or 60 Hz sine wave, called a Pilottone, was recorded on a second parallel track of an audio recorder.

In double-system film, speed variations of camera and recorder, as well as the elasticity of the magnetic recording tape, requires some positive means of keying the dialogue to its appropriate film frame. The inclusion on the sound recorder of a second, parallel, sync or &quot;Pilotone&quot; track, has been the most common method in use until today. In video recording, synchronism is electronically generated and generally called dual-system sound 

On location, a camera is driven by a DC motor, with some sort of governor control to hold it fairly accurate at 24 fps, a sync pulse generator geared to the movement or motor shaft could be employed to provide the sync pulse output. A cable conducts the sync pulse from camera to sound recorder. The sync pulse is typically a sine wave of 50 or 60 Hz with an RMS amplitude of approximately 1 volt.

This double-system audio recording could then be transferred or &quot;resolved&quot; to sprocketed magnetic film, with sprocket holes that match one to one with the original camera film. These two sprocketed media could be run through a &quot;Moviola&quot; or flat-bed editing table such as the Steenbeck for synchronous sound editing. 

With the introduction of the Bulova &quot;Accutron&quot; watch that used a tuning fork as a time reference (watches later used an oscillating electronic crystal), the camera no longer needed to be connected to the sound recorder with a cable. The camera speed was controlled by one oscillator, and a second oscillator in the recorder generated the Pilotone.

This method was developed in the 1960s by pioneering filmmaker Richard Leacock. It was called Direct Cinema. Filmmakers abandoned the studio and went out on location to film, often with hand-held cameras. 

In 1972, Bell &amp; Howell brought out a consumer version of a double-system Super-8 sound filmmaking system called &quot;Filmosound&quot;. A compact cassette recorder was attached to the camera with a cable that transmitted a single pulse to the recorder every time a new frame of film was exposed in the camera. On playback, the cassette recorder pulse was used to control the projector speed.

At that time, Ricky Leacock, a professor in the MIT architecture department film section, developed a Super-8 film production system with a crystal-controlled camera, a crystal-generated Pilotone cassette recorder, a sprocketed magnetic film recorder, a flatbed editing table, and a projector. The MIT/Leacock System was funded with a $300,000 grant from the founder of Polaroid, Edwin Land.

In 1973, the one-pulse-per-frame technique was used to control recording directly onto sprocketed magnetic film in the Super8 Sound Recorder. The Super8 Sound Recorder could also &quot;resolve&quot; sound that had been recorded onto cassette tape with this new &quot;digital&quot; sync pulse.

Today, digital video cameras and digital sound recorders synchronize electronically, being used for double-system video production.

==Pioneering films==
* On the Bowery by Lionel Rogosin (1956)
* Chronicle of a Summer by Jean Rouch (1958)
* Les Raquetteurs by Michel Brault and Gilles Groulx  (1958)

==Sync sound in Asia==

In Hong Kong, sync sound was not widely used until the 1990s, as the generally noisy environment and lower production budgets made such a method impractical.

Indian films shot using sync sound include the first Indian talkie &quot;Alam Ara&quot; released in 1931 and art house films such as Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;. The then popular Mitchell camera, which could be operated silently made it possible to shoot in sync sound. However, due to the change of shooting environments from studios to locations, as well as the surging popularity of the more portable but noisy Arri 2c camera, shooting with sync sound became less common during the mid 60s. Thus, most Indian films, including Hindi films, shot after the 1960s do not use sync sound and for that very reason the 2001 films &quot;Lagaan&quot; and &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; were noted for its use. The common practice in the Indian film industry, even today, is to dub the dialogues during post-production.

<text>Balvenie distillery is a Speyside single malt Scotch whisky distillery located in Dufftown, Scotland. Is owned by William Grant &amp; Sons.

==History==
William Grant was born on 19 December 1839 in his father&#x27;s house in Dufftown. At seven he began herding cattle at a farm on the upper reaches of the River Deveron. He was apprenticed to a shoemaker then worked as a clerk, and then became a bookkeeper at Mortlach distillery 1866. There he was appointed as a clerk and then manager and learned the distilling trade.

After about twenty years, Grant left his job at the Mortlach distillery and bought a field near Balvenie Castle. He then drew up plans for his distillery, and the foundation stone was laid in the autumn of 1886.

Grant remained active in the company until his death in 1923 at the age of 83.

In early 1892 work began to convert an 18th-century mansion (Balvenie New House) into a distillery.
The building took fifteen months to complete, and on 1 May 1893, the first distillation took place at the Balvenie Distillery.

David Stewart MBE, Balvenie&#x27;s Malt Master, is one of the industry&#x27;s most experienced experts and began working with William Grant &amp; Sons in 1962. He was the first to create the process that would later be known as wood finishing, whereby whiskies are matured in one type of cask, such as ex-Bourbon barrels, then transferred into a second cask type (such as ex Sherry, Port or Rum), resulting in a greater depth and complexity of the final flavour of the whisky. He received his MBE from Queen Elizabeth II on the 5th of July, 2016 for his services to the Scotch Whisky Industry.

==In media==
In 2007, The Balvenie&#x27;s previous Global Brand Ambassador David Laird presented an online documentary series about the making of malt whisky, shot in and around the Balvenie Distillery.

==Whiskies==
Balvenie makes whisky in the traditional batch process of the production of single malt. The use of locally grown barley is preferred, and it is floor-malted where possible. Of the 120+ distilleries in Scotland, Balvenie is one of only seven distilleries with its own malting floor. And the only distillery that still practises all 5 of the Rare Crafts all on site (growing barley, malting barley, onsite Copper Smith, onsite Cooperage, and The Balvenie Malt Master, David C Stewart).

<text>Steven Alexander James (born 21 November 1968) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of the rock band Blur. He has also played with the bands Fat Les, Me Me Me, WigWam and Bad Lieutenant.

==Music career==
James was born in Boscombe, Bournemouth, and attended the state grammar school Bournemouth School, where he started playing in bands. He credits the Beatles with inspiring him to pursue music: &quot;I was off school with chickenpox when John Lennon was shot in 1980. I spent the week watching a VHS recording of the Beatles film &quot;Help!&quot;, which was broadcast on TV the day he died. I still watch it once a year. Then I bought a Beatles songbook and a guitar, figured out the chord shapes and started strumming and singing along. I never looked back.&quot;

In 1988, James met future bandmate Graham Coxon at Goldsmiths College, where James studied French. Introductions with Coxon&#x27;s old school friend Damon Albarn and Dave Rowntree soon took place; at the time Albarn and Rowntree were part of a band called Circus.

In 1989, James joined Coxon, Albarn and Rowntree&#x27;s new band, Seymour, which would later be renamed Blur. He has been in the band ever since, although in 2008 he described the days of being a constant band member as &quot;a past-life&quot;.

Almost immediately after this, Blur got together with returning bandmate Graham Coxon to perform at Glastonbury Festival, Hyde Park, Oxegen and T in the Park during the summer of 2009. They also played shows at Goldsmiths College, Essex Museum and other venues around the UK and mainland Europe. Blur headlined a show at Hyde Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. In 2013, the band performed at the Rock Werchter in Belgium, the Spanish and Portuguese dates of the Primavera Sound festival, and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States.

=== Collaborations ===

Unlike Albarn, Coxon and Rowntree, James has not released any solo material, although he has been involved in other collaborative side projects. In 1998, James formed Fat Les with actor Keith Allen and artist Damien Hirst, releasing the unofficial theme song (excluding three others) &quot;Vindaloo&quot; for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. He also worked on side project Me Me Me with Stephen Duffy, co-wrote songs for Marianne Faithfull (appearing in drag playing a double bass in the music video for her single &quot;Sex With Strangers&quot;) and Jane McDonald, and worked with Florence and the Machine and Gene Loves Jezebel.

James worked with Sophie Ellis-Bextor on her solo debut &quot;Read My Lips&quot;, co-writing and co-producing &quot;Move This Mountain&quot;, and co-producing &quot;I Believe&quot; with Ellis-Bextor and producer Ben Hillier. He also played bass on both tracks. Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot; also featured James as bass player and co-writer on the track &quot;Love Is It Love&quot;. He also joined his friend and singer-songwriter Betty Boo in a band called WigWam in 2005. In 2009, James appeared as bass player on debut Bad Lieutenant record &quot;Never Cry Another Tear&quot;. The band consists of New Order lead singer Bernard Sumner and guitarist Phil Cunningham, along with Jake Evans of Rambo And Leroy. In 2013, James co-wrote the song &quot;Did I Lose You?&quot;, performed by Giorgia and Olly Murs.

== Other ventures ==
=== Writing ===
Alex James is a food writer for &quot;The Sun&quot; and has a weekly column, &#x27;Alex James on All Things Food&#x27;; as well as a regular column on farm and family life in The Sunday Telegraph titled &#x27;Mucking In&#x27;. He also writes a monthly column on cheese for Esquire Magazine.
Alex contributes to a number of other British newspapers including &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, as well as &quot;Q&quot; magazine, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Idler&quot;. An autobiography of James&#x27;s experience with Blur, &quot;Bit of a Blur&quot;, was published in June 2007 by Little, Brown &amp; Company. It has since been described as &quot;the definitive guide to Britpop&quot;. James published a follow-up entitled &quot;All Cheeses Great and Small: A Life Less Blurry&quot; in September 2011, charting his transformation from rock star to cheesemaker as he moves to a farm in Oxfordshire.

=== Television appearances ===
In 2001, James and Graham Coxon appeared in the Channel 4 Pixies documentary &quot;Gouge&quot;. James represented &quot;The Idler&quot; on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;University Challenge: The Professionals&quot; in 2005 with John Moore of Black Box Recorder. They secured a heavy win over the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in their heat, but did not score highly enough to return for the tournament&#x27;s later stages. In 2007, James was a judge on the Channel 4 show Orange unsignedAct and, in November 2007, appeared as a panellist on the BBC One satirical news quiz, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He also appeared in episode #3.4 of Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s The F Word TV series as a participant in the Recipe Challenge which occurs in each episode. In August 2008, James appeared in reality TV series, &quot;Maestro&quot; on BBC Two. He was voted out in the fourth episode of the series.

In September 2008, a documentary television series, &quot;Cocaine Diaries: Alex James in Colombia&quot;, premiered on BBC America, in conjunction with the BBC America Reveals program. As the documentary progresses, James – who admits to having used cocaine extensively during Blur&#x27;s Britpop heyday – learns about Colombia&#x27;s violent drug export trade. In October 2009, James presented an episode of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; and, in January 2010, he participated in the ITV1 reality television programme &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot;. On 4 March 2012, James appeared on &quot;Top Gear&quot; as a guest for their &#x27;star in a reasonably priced car&#x27; segment, clocking in at 1:45.2.

On 3 December 2011, he appeared on &quot;The Chase&quot; with Sara Cox, Ann Widdecombe and Eamonn Holmes against chaser Anne Hegerty, but he was caught by the chaser. On 16 March 2012, James appeared on &quot;The Bank Job&quot; and made the final, where he was beaten by Rachel Riley. He is also the first Bank Job contestant to find two &quot;bankrupts&quot; in a single game. James has been a participant in BBC One programme &quot;10 Things You Need to Know About Losing Weight&quot;. On 26 December 2014, he appeared as one of the celebrity homeowners on &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; with Keith Lemon. In August 2015, he won the Channel 4 programme &quot;[Celebrity Fifteen to One]&quot;.

A 2016 documentary titled &quot;Alex James: Slowing Down Fast Fashion&quot; examined the fashion industry and how &quot;consumers&#x27; seemingly unquenchable thirst for cheap clothing is having a huge effect on the environment and workers, both at home here in the UK and abroad&quot;.

=== Radio ===
In 2007, James presented the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;On Your Farm&quot;. He presents &quot;Alex James&#x27;s Date Night&quot; on Classic FM every Saturday at 7-10pm.

James presented &quot;The A-Z of Classic FM Music&quot;. The show was named Commercial Radio Programme of the Year at the Arqiva Commercial Radio Awards on 5 June 2009. He has also contributed to the show&#x27;s accompanying memorabilia, writing the foreword to both the book and CD box set, published by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in 2010.

=== Cheesemaking ===

After his career with Blur, James moved into cheese production. He purchased a farmhouse in the Cotswolds and renovated it into a cheese farm. His 200-acre cheese farm in Kingham, Oxfordshire, now produces cheeses including Good Queen Maude, Blue Monday (named after his favourite New Order song) and Goddess. James made two cheeses with New Zealand cheese expert Juliet Harbutt: Little Wallop (2007) and Farleigh Wallop (2009); the latter won the Best Goat&#x27;s Cheese award at the 2009 British Cheese Awards.

In 2011, James launched a range of everyday cheeses through at Asda. with flavour combinations include &#x27;cheddar and tomato ketchup&#x27;, &#x27;cheddar and salad cream&#x27;, and &#x27;cheddar and tikka masala&#x27;. Tim Chester, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described James&#x27;s cheese as &quot;bizarre flavour mash-ups in sliced, processed, plasticky form&quot;.

=== Music and food festivals ===
James announced he would open his Oxfordshire farm to host an annual food and music festival. The event, Alex James Presents Harvest, ran from 9 to 12 September 2011, in conjunction with promoter Big Wheel Promotions. The event had a shaky start when Big Wheel Promotions went bankrupt leaving the ticketing company out of pocket and stallholders and performers unpaid.

The local primary school, Kingham Primary, were also owed £7000 for the entertainment they organised, with the headteacher telling &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;We are either going to have to lose the music teacher or take it from other budgets which will reduce other parts of the curriculum&quot;.

In December 2011, a concert was staged locally to settle the debt. &quot;I pledged to match the funds raised from my own pocket ... I was very happy to do that&quot; said James. Big Wheel Promotions, the company behind Harvest, then abruptly ceased trading even though it had already taken ticket fees for 2012. Alex James Presents Harvest was also notable for a photograph of James with David Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson.

Since 2012, James, along with Jamie Oliver, has hosted &quot;The Big Feastival&quot;, an annual food and music festival, on his Oxfordshire farm. On joining forces with James, Oliver said &quot;The Big Feastival was a great success in South London last year and I cannot wait to take this celebration of the greatest chefs, the best local produce and suppliers and some fantastic entertainment to a more rural location at Alex&#x27;s.&quot; Along with live musical performances from Paloma Faith, Gaz Coombes, The Cuban Brothers, Noisettes, Razorlight, Texas, and Sahand, there were cooking demonstrations, masterclasses, Q&amp;As and book signings with well-known chefs, as well as family entertainment from Peppa Pig, Slow Food Kids&#x27; Taste Adventure and Chipping Norton Theatre. The Big Feastival returned to James&#x27;s farm on 31 August and 1 September 2013 with a line-up including KT Tunstall, The Feeling, Rizzle Kicks and Basement Jaxx. The festival attracted over 30,000 attendees in 2014, and has continued to be held annually on August Bank Holiday weekend.

On 19 June 2019, James visited Bledington Primary School and invited the children to submit a fun, colourful, festival-inspired design. The winning entry was displayed as a stage backdrop at The Big Feastival.

The most recent iteration of The Big Feastival took place on 23–25 August 2024. The music line-up included Snow Patrol, Becky Hill, Kate Nash, Johnny Marr, Scouting for Girls and Ella Henderson, with DJs including Jax Jones, Judge Jules and Jeremy Healy. Food stages and stalls hosted chefs including Raymond Blanc, Andi and Miquita Oliver, Max La Manna and Cherish Finden. Entertainment acts included Rhys James, Zoe Lyons, James Buckley and Justin Fletcher.

==Personal life==
James&#x27;s father, Jason, was sales director of a company selling waste compactors and baling machines. James married Claire Neate, a music video producer, in April 2003 in Cheltenham. They have five children. The family live near Kingham in Oxfordshire on a 200-acre (0.81 km2) cheese farm; James is considered by the press to be a member of the Chipping Norton set.

In his book, James describes a long period of decadent lifestyle. To celebrate his birthday in São Paulo one year, he got the tour manager to find him a balthazar of champagne, which he shared with the five prettiest groupies who were at the hotel door. James estimated that he spent about 1 million pounds on champagne and cocaine; in 2015, however, he said that this story was not true. He mentions a long list of favourite bars, including the Groucho Club and The Colony Room.

Bournemouth University presented James with an honorary doctorate in November 2010. He also received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Gloucestershire in November 2013.

<text>PWM rectifier (Pulse-width modulation rectifier) is an AC to DC power converter, that is implemented using forced commutated power electronic semiconductor switches. Conventional PWM converters are used for wind turbines that have a permanent-magnet alternator.

Today, insulated gate bipolar transistors are typical switching devices. In contrast to diode bridge rectifiers, PWM rectifiers achieve bidirectional power flow. In frequency converters this property makes it possible to perform regenerative braking. PWM rectifiers are also used in distributed power generation applications, such as micro turbines, fuel cells and windmills.

The major advantage of using the pulse width modulation technique is the reduction of higher order harmonics. It also makes it possible to control the magnitude of the output voltage, and improve the power factor by forcing the switches to follow the input voltage waveform using a PLL loop. Thus we can reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD).

==Types of PWM rectifiers==

* Warsaw rectifier (invented 1992)
* Vienna rectifier (invented 1993)

<text>Green mix is an early step in the manufacturing of black powder for explosives. It is a rough mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur in the correct proportions (75:15:10) for black powder, but is not milled, pressed or corned. It burns much more slowly than black powder, when it chooses to burn at all, can still explode if ignited in a confined place; the deflagration is usually characterized by short, uneven sizzling followed by relatively long periods of smoulder.

==Usage==
Green mix is merely an unfinished product and not generally used itself in any pyrotechnic or projectile applications.

<doc id="1047872" wikidata="Q440600" url="?curid=1047872" title="Renée Jeanne Falconetti">
<text>Renée Jeanne Falconetti (21 July 1892 – 12 December 1946), sometimes credited as Maria Falconetti, Marie Falconetti, Renée Maria Falconetti, or simply Falconetti, was a French stage and film actress, notable for her acclaimed role as Joan of Arc in Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s 1928 silent &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; and subsequent mysterious and enigmatic death. There is little recorded information about her life and career on the internet, and much of the existing information about her life is contradictory.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis, Falconetti grew up poor and was schooled by nuns who did not support her acting ambitions. Despite this, she became a stage actress in Paris by entertaining soldiers during World War I. She made a name for herself in the early 1920s, mainly playing roles in light comedies and musicals.

==&quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;==
When Carl Th. Dreyer discovered Falconetti in an amateur theatre production of &quot;La Garçonne&quot; and selected her for the lead role in his upcoming production &quot;La Passion de Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, she was already a celebrated stage artist at 35 years old&quot;.&quot; Her portrayal is widely considered one of the more astonishing performances committed to film, and it remained her final cinematic role. Whether or not this is her first film credit is a topic of debate, as some claim that she had two previous film credits, though a supposed interview with Falconetti sees her claim that &quot;La Passion de Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; is her first film role after a few &quot;test pictures.&quot;

Many writers have claimed that Falconetti&#x27;s performance was the result of extreme cruelty at the hands of Dreyer, a notoriously demanding director who pushed her to the brink of emotional collapse. For example, film critic Roger Ebert writes:

For Falconetti, the performance was an ordeal. Legends from the set tell of Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression from her face – so that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain. He filmed the same shots again and again, hoping that in the editing room he could find exactly the right nuance in her facial expression.
However, in their biography of Dreyer, Jean and Dale Drum say that these stories are based only on rumour and that &quot;there is no evidence that Dreyer could be called a sadist&quot;. They quote onlookers who described Dreyer&#x27;s working relationship with Falconetti: Initially in the production process, &quot;Dreyer and Falconetti would watch the rushes of a single scene together, seven or eight times, until Dreyer could pick out a little bit, maybe a few feet, where the effect was what they wanted, and when they reshot the scene, she could play it without the least inhibition. Just those few feet of film had inspired her.&quot; Later, Falconetti became able to play scenes only from Dreyer&#x27;s explanations, without the need even for rehearsal.

==Subsequent career and death==

After filming &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, Falconetti continued with her career as a producer of light stage comedies, appearing with the Comédie-Française. During World War II, she escaped from France first to Switzerland, Brazil, and then left for Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

Falconetti had suffered from mental illness all her life, and in 1946 she died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, an apparent suicide, by a self-imposed restrictive diet after having become significantly overweight. Her remains are interred at Montmartre Cemetery in Paris, section 16 (her grave site is not listed on official maps). Her grandson Gérard Falconetti also became an actor.

<doc id="1047873" wikidata="Q1761269" url="?curid=1047873" title="Raffle">
<text>A raffle is a gambling competition in which people obtain numbered tickets, each of which has the chance of winning a prize. At a set time, the winners are drawn at random from a container holding a copy of each number. The drawn tickets are checked against a collection of prizes with numbers attached to them, and the holder of the ticket wins the prize.

The raffle is a popular game in many countries, and is often held to raise funds for a specific charity or event.

==Process==
A raffle may involve several separate prizes, possibly donated, with a different ticket drawn for each prize, so a purchaser of a ticket may not be attracted to a specific prize, but for the possibility of winning any of those offered. The draw for prizes may be held at a special event, with many onlookers and overseen by a club official or well-known person. In the prize draw, one ticket is drawn for the initial prize; that ticket is then left out of the container. A second ticket is then drawn for the next prize, and that ticket also is discarded, and so on. This continues until all prizes have been won.

===Chinese auction===

A common practice for increasing revenue from ticket sales is to offer bulk sales of tickets, e.g., $10 per single ticket or $25 for three tickets, although this practice is illegal in some countries. This practise is also known as Chinese auction. In some places, (eg. Australia) raffles are regulated and require a permit, or may only be legal for registered nonprofits. Players tend to spend more money on bulk tickets believing they have a much better chance of winning. Since the tickets cost little to produce, and the prize expense has been set, the number of tickets sold creates little or no additional cost for the raffle holders.

==Tombola==

Tombola is a raffle mostly played at Christmas time. Prizes are often only of symbolic value. With the Italian mass emigration of the 19th and 20th centuries, the game which originated in Southern Italy was exported abroad and it took different forms and names such as Bingo.

==Private raffle==

The process may be employed, where legal, to dispose of a high-value item such as a horse, car or real estate. One example was American-Australian photographer Townsend Duryea&#x27;s raffling off his yacht &quot;Coquette&quot; in 1858.

Where the prize is a valuable work of art, the process may be termed an art union, particularly where the beneficiary is the originating artist. Australian artists who have disposed of their works in this way include Alfred Felton, James Ashton. and E. H. Baggs.

==Worldwide==
In the UK, the term &quot;tombola&quot; is used when the raffle tickets are placed in a barrel and tumbled before the winning tickets are drawn from the barrel. The tombola booth is commonly used as a fundraising event for local fetes.

In New Zealand and Australia, meat raffles are commonplace in pubs and registered clubs. Trays of meat or seafood are raffled to raise money for a cause, often a local sporting club. Similar raffles are held in Minnesota and Rhode Island.

==Cash raffle==
In a cash raffle, the prize is a portion of the total earnings. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;50/50&quot; draws, with half of the money going to the raffle winner and half to organizers or a charity they are supporting, although the prize may not necessarily be equal to 50 percent of the earnings. Such raffles are illegal in some places, such as California (with limited exceptions).

<text>The schedule of 11 public holidays in [[Singapore]] which are gazetted and recognized since the establishment of Singapore&#x27;s 1998 Holidays Act.

==List of public holidays in Singapore ==
There are generally 10 public holidays a year; however, since the gap between the Islamic calendar and the Gregorian calendar lasts around 11 days, Hari Raya Aidil Fitri and Hari Raya Aidil Adha are respectively celebrated twice in a Gregorian calendar year every 32 or 33 years. This occurred in 1968 and 2000 for Hari Raya Puasa as well as 1974 and 2006 for Hari Raya Haji, giving Singaporeans 12 public holidays in those years, not 13 since they are not close enough to be both celebrated twice in the same Gregorian year, only either one of the two.

Under the Holidays Act, should a public holiday fall on a Sunday, the following Monday is gazetted as a public holiday (also called holiday-in-lieu). There are however, special occasions, that may be gazetted by the President of Singapore to declare any day to be observed as a public holiday by modifying any days specified in the schedule to the Holidays&#x27; Act and if any, another day to be observed as an additional public holiday when in that year two public holidays fall on the same day. One such occasion occurred during the 2015 National Day, whereas an additional day of August 7 was gazetted as a public holiday in addition to August 10 being the holiday-in-lieu.

If any public holiday falls on a Saturday in Singapore, the following Monday is declared as a school holiday for students in primary and secondary schools, only if that Monday is not a public holiday itself.

===General / presidential elections ===
Under Section 35 of the Parliamentary Elections Act and Section 17 of the Presidential Elections Act, Polling Day for a general election or a presidential election (but not by-elections) is a public holiday that is gazetted by the returning officer from the Elections Department Singapore. Under the Employment Act, employees not required to work on that day are entitled to one day off in lieu or be given one day&#x27;s pay.

* General election - To elect the next government of Singapore
* Presidential election - To elect the next president of Singapore

==Defunct public holidays==

Up to and including 1968, these few were also gazetted as public holidays but were removed to improve business competitiveness.

* Boxing Day - celebrated the day after Christmas Day
* Easter Monday - in the Western Christian liturgical calendar, the second day of Eastertide and analogously in the Byzantine Rite is the second day of Bright Week
* Holy Saturday - the Saturday of Holy Week, also known as the Great Sabbath, Black Saturday, or Easter Eve, and called &quot;Joyous Saturday&quot; or &quot;the Saturday of Light&quot; among Coptic Christians, is the day after Good Friday
* Thaipusam - A Hindu festival celebrated mostly by the Tamil community on the full moon in the Tamil month of Thai
* Mawlid - The observance of the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad which is celebrated in Rabi&#x27; al-awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar
* Second day of Hari Raya Puasa - Second day of Hari Raya

== Workers&#x27; rights ==
It is legal for employers to agree to give their employees other holidays in substitution for one or more public holidays. No act or thing relating to any government department or public authority, any judicial proceeding, any transaction, instrument or any other act or thing is rendered invalid where it is done or executed on a Sunday or public holiday.

Under the Employment Act, an employee who is required to work on a public holiday is entitled to an extra day&#x27;s salary at the basic rate of pay, in addition to the gross rate of pay for that holiday.

The days observed as general public holidays in Singapore are declared in the schedule to the Holidays Act. According to the Ministry of Manpower, which issues a yearly list of the dates on which public holidays fall, the holidays were &quot;chosen and agreed upon after close consultation with different community and religious leaders in Singapore&quot;. Other factors taken into account were the impact on business costs and statutory leave provided for under the Employment Act. Thus, some religious holidays such as Easter Monday, Mawlid (the birthday of Muhammad), Boxing Day and Thaipusam were removed from the list of public holidays to improve business competitiveness.

<doc id="1047882" wikidata="Q3544621" url="?curid=1047882" title="USS Sea Devil (SS-400)">
<text>USS &quot;Sea Devil&quot; (SS/AGSS-400), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sea devil (&quot;Manta birostria&quot;), the largest of all rays, noted for power and endurance.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sea Devil&quot;″s keel was laid down 18 November 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 28 February 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Sherman K. Kennedy, and commissioned on 24 May 1944.

==World War II==

=== First war patrol, September – October 1944 ===

Completing shakedown training at New London, Connecticut, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; departed that port on 11 July 1944 and arrived at her home port, Pearl Harbor, on 9 August to join Submarine Division (SubDiv) 281 and prepare for her first war patrol. On 3 September, she sailed west. By 15 September, she was off Honshū, and, during the early morning darkness, made contact with her first enemy ships — two sampan-type patrol vessels. Rough seas, however, precluded an attack, and she continued on to patrol in the shipping lanes to Japan&#x27;s major ports: Yokohama, Kobe, and Osaka.

On 16 September, at 04:32, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; made her second contact; submerged; and commenced closing the target. At 05:38, the enemy, a cargo submarine, was sighted. At 05:45, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; made her first attack. Four torpedoes were fired. Two exploded against the target. &quot;Sea Devil&quot; lost depth control. A minute later, periscope depth was regained. Brown smoke marked the enemy&#x27;s previous location. Seven underwater explosions followed. By 05:53, a large oil slick
covered the site where the Japanese submarine had gone down.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; reloaded and continued to move closer to Japan. On 17 September and 18 September, mountainous seas inhibited hunting. On 21 September, the submarine commenced running along the 100 fathom (183 m) curve, but the strong Kuroshio Current there caused her to lose ground and forced her to shift her course.

On the morning of 22 September, she made several contacts, but all were too small. During the early afternoon, she sighted a small convoy and fired on a freighter. The target turned toward the submarine. &quot;Sea Devil&quot; went deep. An hour later, the surface ships had gone and the hunted submarine again became a hunter.

During her remaining 22 days on station, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; attacked several targets, but scored on none. In mid-October, she headed for Majuro for refit, and, on 19 November, she got underway for the waters west of the Nansei Shoto.

=== Second war patrol, November – December 1944 ===

At the end of the month, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; entered the East China Sea and turned toward the Kyūshū coast. On 1 December, just prior to midnight, she made radar contact with a distant convoy and commenced running with the state-five sea on four engines to gain position. At 02:39 on 2 December, she changed course to close the convoy. A minute later, she took a wave over the bridge which knocked the starboard lookout onto the bridge deck; flooded the main induction and both engine rooms to the lower deck plates; and sent water through the supply line into the after battery compartment, the crew&#x27;s mess, and the radio shack. A solid stream came into the control room via the conning tower. But, other than numerous electrical grounds, no damage was sustained.

By 03:20, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; was ahead and off the port track of the convoy. The radar showed 11 definite targets and indicated the presence of others. Weather and visibility, however, worked against a night surface attack.

At 03:22, a floating naval mine was sighted less than off the port bow. &quot;Sea Devil&quot; swung right with full rudder. Ten minutes later, she submerged and commenced her approach, heading for the port flank of the convoy.

By 04:00, the moon had clouded over. Periscope observations became progressively more difficult. At 04:13, an escort, pinging, passed &quot;Sea Devil&quot; close aboard. Sound conditions were also poor.

At 04:14 &quot;Sea Devil&quot; commenced firing. Four Mark-18 torpedoes headed for a medium-sized freighter, but all missed. At 04:24, she fired tubes five and six at a large ship away. Forty seconds later, the torpedoes hit, throwing a huge column of debris into the air. The stricken ship was troopship &quot;Hawaii Maru&quot; with some 2,000 soldiers on board. At 04:25, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; swung right to avoid an escort ahead of the ships in the center column. By 04:27, water was over the deck of the &quot;Hawaii Maru&quot;. There were no survivors. At 04:28, another escort passed &quot;Sea Devil&quot;. A minute later, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; launched four torpedoes from her stern tubes at a large passenger ship away, the &quot;Akikawa Maru&quot;. A look around through the periscope then revealed a larger freighter in the center column less than away and headed directly for the submarine.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; went deep. At 04:30, she was jolted by a tremendous explosion. Her torpedoes had hit, and from the concussion it appeared that the ship had been carrying ammunition. Breaking up noises quickly followed the explosion. Former Japanese professional baseball player, Eiji Sawamura lost his life in the attack, together with some 300 other Japanese soldiers.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; leveled off at and rigged for depth charging. Twelve were counted; none was close. Escorts milled about overhead for the next 40 minutes; then the sound of screws faded out. Pinging was heard for a while longer, and distant depth charges were heard for several hours.

After sinking &quot;Akikawa Maru&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Maru&quot;, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; continued to patrol the sea lanes to Kyūshū. On 4 December, she received a positive ship contact report from a China-based B-29 Superfortress, but the position was too distant. On 5 December, she sighted only two small fishing trawlers. Then, on the evening of 8 December, she made radar contact with four distant targets zigging on various courses toward Nagasaki.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; went to full power on four engines and began gaining slowly. At , the radar pips were estimated to be one battleship or aircraft carrier, two light cruisers, and four destroyers. Darkness and intermittent rain squalls interfered with visibility.

By 00:00, 9 December, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; had gained a good position ahead of the nearest escort and off the port track of the largest pip. At 00:05, she began a submerged radar approach. At 00:17, she began tracking by sound, and, ten minutes later she fired four Mark-23 torpedoes at the target. Two hit. Poor visibility precluded a damage assessment.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; went deep and rigged for depth charging but, by 00:50, the sounds of searching surface ships faded out. At 01:07, the submarine surfaced and headed up the target&#x27;s track. An hour later, she reversed her course and headed back to her patrol area. That evening sister ship 
confirmed &quot;Sea Devil&quot;’s hits, but was unable to provide a damage estimate. Later reports identified the damaged ship as the aircraft carrier &quot;Junyō&quot;, which was subsequently damaged further by submarine . &quot;Junyō&quot; remained in the repair yard through the end of the war.

At mid-month, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; moved further south to patrol off Okinawa; and, on 29 December, she headed for Midway Island and Pearl Harbor.

=== Third war patrol, February – April 1945 ===

On 7 February 1945, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; cleared Pearl Harbor for her third war patrol. On 19 February, she arrived at Saipan for training in wolfpack tactics, and, on 27 February, she sailed for the Yellow Sea in company with submarines , , and
. At the end of the month, she was diverted to search for downed aviators; and, on 3 March, she continued on to her patrol area to further decrease the declining traffic between China and Manchuria, and the Japanese home islands.

For over a week, fishing junks, sailing junks, and floating naval mines provided the only contacts. On 24 February, she sighted a large tanker with four escorts but lost the convoy. On 25 February, she sighted and evaded a Japanese hunter-killer group. On 29 February, she sank or exploded four mines and attempted to do the same to two others.

Fog shrouded her area during the last days of the month. On 2 April, visibility was still poor, less than . At 07:10, she made radar contact with an enemy convoy-four merchantmen and three escorts. At 09:15, she commenced firing at the lead merchant ship. Forty seconds later, she fired at the next ship. She then swung around to bring her stern tubes to bear on a third merchant ship; found herself well inside the escort on the convoy&#x27;s starboard quarter; continued swinging and fired three stern shots at the escort. Between 08:19 and 08:22, seven hits were heard and felt.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; then left the formation and opened range to reload. The radar screen now showed only three small pips. The third torpedo of the first salvo had apparently missed its target and run on to hit the third maru.

After reloading, the submarine tracked the remaining units of the convoy. Shortly after 10:00, she fired on and damaged one of the escorts. Forty minutes later, she fired on the remaining merchantman and observed it suddenly disappear from the radar screen. After 11:00, she made her way through the wreckage to pick up survivors. Only four allowed themselves to be picked up; and, of these, one died of his wounds.

Of the seven ships, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; had sunk three — cargo ships &quot;Taijo Maru&quot;, &quot;Edogawa Maru&quot;, and &quot;Misshan Maru&quot; — and had damaged the fourth maru and at least one of the escorts.

The submarine remained in her Yellow Sea patrol area for another three days, then headed for Midway. On 6 April, however, she received orders to patrol south of Kyūshū, and, on 8 April, she was ordered closer to Okinawa in search of four downed United States Marine Corps Reserve pilots of U.S. Navy Bombing Fighter Squadron 83 (VBF-83). The pilots, from the aircraft carrier , had been covering the movements of the Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; and, on running low on fuel, had ditched in a location they thought to be near Okinawa. Prior to midnight on 8 April, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; located three of the pilots northeast of Okinawa. The search for the fourth continued through the night. With dawn on 9 April, friendly planes joined in the search. But they, too, were unsuccessful; and, in the late afternoon &quot;Sea Devil&quot; continued southeastward. On the evening of 9 April, a VBF-83 pilot testing the guns of his F4U Corsair fighter inadvertently fired toward &quot;Sea Devil&quot; while she was on the surface, and one tracer round almost struck &quot;Sea Devil&quot;′s officer of the deck.

=== Fourth war patrol, May – July 1945 ===

On 13 April, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; arrived at Saipan. On 20 April, she completed her patrol, for which she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, at Midway Island. On 28 May, she was back at Saipan, and, on 30 May, she, along with submarines and , got underway. On 6 June, she entered the East China Sea via Tokara Kaikyo and headed northward to the Yellow Sea. On 7 June, she made her way through the islands of southwestern Korea; and, on 8 June, she commenced patrolling between the Shantung peninsula and Korea.

On the afternoon of 14 June, a cargo ship, with an escort on either side, was sighted through the high periscope. &quot;Sea Devil&quot; submerged, maneuvered into position; launched four torpedoes &quot;down-the-throat,&quot; then changed course radically to avoid a collision with the target. Twenty-three seconds after firing, two of the torpedoes hit the target. &quot;Wakamiyasan Maru&quot; went under. Her escorts dropped depth charges. Five were fairly close. &quot;Sea Devil&quot; dropped below a 20-degree temperature gradient and worked her way out.

On the morning of 21 June, she sighted three armed trawlers, one under tow, headed from Shantung toward Korea. At 09:43, she surfaced and, three minutes later, commenced firing with her five-inch (127 mm) gun, 40 millimeter and 20 millimeter guns. The 40 millimeter soon jammed, but fire from the five-inch (127 mm) gun and 20 millimeter guns sank the trawler being towed and left a second burning and settling. The third, the towing vessel, cast loose and headed west under full steam. &quot;Sea Devil&quot; picked up three survivors and moved south to patrol in another area.

Poor weather impaired hunting during the next six days. On 27 June, however, she was able to take photographs of Saishu To and Chiri To; and, on 29 June she was diverted to search and rescue operations.

Assisted by a PB2Y Coronado and a PBM Mariner, she picked up a PBM crew from Rescue Squadron 4, Kerama Retto, on the evening of 30 June, then located the pilot of a United States Army Air Corps P-47 Thunderbolt based at Ie Shima. Another man, who had become separated, was located by accompanying aircraft the following morning and was picked up before noon.

=== Fifth war patrol, August – September 1945 ===

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; remained on life guard duty in the northern Ryukyu Islands and southern Kyūshū area until 10 July, then headed east to Guam for refit and the installation of LORAN equipment and a radio direction finder. On 9 August, she headed back to the Yellow Sea. On 14 August, she transited the Nansei Shoto, passing south of Akuseki Shima; and, on 15 August, after entering her patrol area, she received word of Japan&#x27;s acceptance of Allied surrender terms.

For another two weeks, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; remained in the area, looking for and sinking naval mines. On 27 August, she sighted a fishing vessel near a mine. Closer inspection showed that the fisherman was using the mine as a buoy and had secured his net to the mine horns. On 28 August, the submarine was ordered to Guam, then diverted to Subic Bay, where she arrived on 3 September.

Within a few weeks, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; was joined by seven other submarines of the new, postwar submarine squadron, SubRon 5. Through the fall, she operated out of Subic Bay, conducting intensive training operations necessitated by a heavy turnover in personnel. On 1 December, she sailed for San Francisco, California, for overhaul and, on 23 April 1946, she returned to her home port, Pearl Harbor.

== 1946–1964 ==

Three days later, SS-400 again headed west. On 16 May, she returned to Subic Bay; and, on 23 May, she continued on to Tsingtao where she provided antisubmarine warfare training services to TF 71 into July. On 5 May, she sailed for Shanghai, whence she proceeded back to Pearl Harbor. From 26 July 1946 to 5 May 1947, she conducted operations in the Hawaiian area. Overhaul at Mare Island took her through the summer. In early October, she returned to Hawaii, and on 27 May, she sailed westward for another tour in the Far East.

A simulated war patrol and the provision of ASW training services occupied her during her deployment; and, on 8 January 1948, she returned to Pearl Harbor whence she operated until ordered to Mare Island for inactivation.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; was decommissioned on 10 September 1948 and remained in the inactive reserve through the end of the decade. Two months after the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, however, she was ordered activated; and, on 2 March 1951, she was recommissioned, assigned to SubDiv 71, SubRon 7, and based at Pearl Harbor.

Through the summer, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; operated in Hawaiian waters. In September, she returned to the west coast to provide ASW training services for Fleet Air Wing 4 in the Puget Sound area. In mid-November, she returned to Hawaii, where she conducted local operations through the winter. From mid-April to mid-June 1952, she underwent overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard; then resumed local operations. In late September, she sailed west for her first deployment to the western Pacific since recommissioning.

&quot;Sea Devil&quot; arrived at Yokosuka on 7 October and commenced providing services to TF 96, which conducted ASW training exercises and maintained preparedness for hunter-killer operations in support of the United Nations effort. In late January 1953, she was detached for patrol purposes. Toward the end of January, she returned to Yokosuka, and, on 3 March, she sailed for Pearl Harbor.

On 30 June, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; again got under way for Puget Sound where she provided services to Fleet Air Wing 4 before heading for San Francisco on 20 August to begin inactivation. On 28 August, she was placed in commission, in reserve; and, on 19 February 1954, she was decommissioned.

Three years later, &quot;Sea Devil&quot; was again activated; and, on 17 August 1957, she was recommissioned and assigned to SubRon 5 at San Diego, California. For the next year, she conducted training operations off southern California and in the Puget Sound area, then prepared for deployment to the western Pacific. From November 1958 to April 1959, she provided services to Seventh Fleet surface units and to Fleet Marine Force Pacific. In May, she returned to San Diego. On 1 July 1960, she was redesignated an auxiliary submarine with hull classification symbol AGSS-400; and, from that time through 1963, she was primarily engaged in training operations off the West Coast. Only two deployments to the western Pacific during February–August 1961 and June–December 1963 interrupted that schedule.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In 1964 &quot;Sea Devil&quot; commenced inactivation for the last time. On 17 February 1964, she was decommissioned. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 April 1964, and she was sunk as a target off Southern California on 24 November 1964.

== Awards ==
&quot;Sea Devil&quot; earned five battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="1047888" wikidata="Q3488424" url="?curid=1047888" title="I, Mudd">
<text>&quot;I, Mudd&quot; is the eighth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Stephen Kandel and directed by Marc Daniels, it was first broadcast on November 3, 1967.

The crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; has a second encounter with the conman Harry Mudd (Roger C. Carmel), first seen in the season one episode &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot;. Mudd is now the supreme ruler of a planet of androids who cater to his every whim.

==Plot==
An alien android posing as a Starfleet lieutenant and identifying himself as Norman, hijacks the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by sealing off engineering and setting a booby trap which would cause any attempt to restore control to destroy the ship. Captain Kirk finds his ship and crew taken to an unknown planet populated by androids, and meets an old nemesis, the outlaw Harry Mudd. Calling himself &quot;Mudd the First&quot; and ostensibly ruling the androids, Mudd displays a darkened glass panel, which he calls a &quot;shrine&quot; to his wife Stella. It contains an android version of his wife which nags him as she did, but he is able to silence her instantly by ordering her to &quot;shut up&quot;.

Mudd explains that he broke out of prison, stole a spaceship, crashed on this planet, and was taken in by the androids. He says they are accommodating, but refuse to let him go unless he provides them with other humans to serve and study. Mudd informs Kirk that he and his crew are to serve this purpose and can expect to spend the rest of their lives there.

Kirk questions the androids and discovers they were built by travelers from the Andromeda Galaxy whose planet was destroyed by a supernova, leaving the androids to fend for themselves. First Officer Spock discovers that the androids number over 200,000, and concludes that there must be some central control mechanism.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew is beamed to the surface and has been replaced with an android crew. They find much appealing about the androids&#x27; world: Scotty is fascinated by their engineering knowledge; Ensign Chekov likes the idea of living on a planet full of compliant female androids; and Uhura is tempted by the offer of immortality in an android body. Kirk will have none of this, however, and reminds them of their duty.

After a final farewell to Stella, Mudd plans to depart aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but the androids refuse his order to beam him aboard. They have their own agenda: to leave the planet and offer their &quot;services&quot; to humanity, with the goal of bringing the greedy and aggressive human race under their control.

As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew discuss their predicament, Spock notes that all of the androids belong to various named series, except for the one named Norman. Kirk recalls that an android called on Norman to &quot;coordinate&quot; the analysis of an &quot;illogical&quot; statement. Spock concludes that Norman is the central locus of the composite android mind, and Kirk suggests that &quot;wild, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman&quot; could be a potent weapon against that mind.

The crew then attempt to confuse the androids by means of contradictory statements and a series of bizarre theatrics, culminating with Mudd and Kirk posing the liar paradox to Norman: Kirk claims everything Mudd says is a lie; and Mudd says to Norman, &quot;I am lying.&quot; Unable to resolve the contradiction, Norman&#x27;s mind burns out, which immediately causes the other androids to shut down.

The crew reprogram Norman and the other androids to return to their original tasks of making the planet productive. Kirk informs Mudd that he has been paroled to the android population as an example of a human failure, and that a special android has been programmed to see to his needs as an incentive to work with the androids and not exploit them. Mudd is grateful until he discovers that this android is Stella, and there are now at least 500 copies of her – none of whom responds to his command to &quot;shut up&quot;.

==Production and reception==
The producers liked the script resulting from Gerrold&#x27;s work on &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; so much that Gerrold was later tasked with re-writing the script for this episode.

Although Kandel is the credited writer on the episode, David Gerrold performed an uncredited rewrite. The final script was heavily revised by the staff, and Gerrold admits that only one original idea of his made it into the final episode. He also claims producer Gene L. Coon offered to put the matter of credit up for Writers Guild arbitration but that he declined.

In 2009, the AV Club called it &quot;goofy, but charmingly surreal&quot;, &quot;infectiously silly&quot; and &quot;a treat,&quot; giving it an A− grade.

In 2014, Charlie Jane Anders at io9 ranked &quot;I, Mudd&quot; as the 79th best episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in a list of the top 100 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes.

In 2016, Syfy noted this episode for actress Nichelle Nichols presentation of Uhura, as having her fifth best scene in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2024 &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; ranked I, Mudd at number 39 out of the 79 original series episodes.

It borders the following municipalities: Valdobbiadene and Farra di Soligo, Moriago della Battaglia, Pederobba and Crocetta del Montello to the south. The municipality is part of the Quartier del Piave. The hilly part of the municipal area is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene&quot;.

==Physical geography==
The municipal territory of Vidor is located in the northern part of the Province of Treviso, and develops partly in the plain and partly in a hilly area with various reliefs that border the Quartier del Piave to the west and north (col Polenta, 211 m; col Castellon, 235 m; col Maor, 368 m). The main waterway that crosses the municipality is the Piave river, a river sacred to the homeland, on which there is one of the historic bridges that connect the right and left banks of the river, the Vidor Bridge. There are also two other streams, worthy of note, that flow in the municipal area: the Teva stream and, in the hamlet of Colbertaldo, the Rosper stream, which contributes to the formation of the characteristic palù, wetlands typical of the Treviso Left Piave.

Among the various climatic zones of the Veneto region, Vidor is located in the hilly area and part of the flat one, where the climate is milder.

==History==
In 1986 a small necropolis was found under Piazza Maggiore, dating back to the fourth century. The area was therefore frequented in Roman times, also given the passage of the Via Claudia Augusta Altinate. In the eastern part of the municipality, moreover, the regularity of the agrarian arrangement would prove the ancient centuriation of the territory. In the Middle Ages, the strategic importance of Vidor as a road junction and river port on the Piave (exploited until 1871), led to the construction of the castle, which has now disappeared, and the abbey, which contributed to the reclamation of the area. In the thirteenth century, the Pio Ospedale di Santa Maria dei Battuti was founded, managed by the confraternity of the same name, with the aim of welcoming the numerous wayfarers who passed through the town.

Vidor was hit hard by the First World War: being right at the Piave front, it was occupied by the Central Powers until the end of the conflict. During the fierce fighting, the artistic heritage of the village, such as the church and the abbey, was damaged. Moreover, thanks to its strategic importance, during the First World War it was chosen to make a &quot;bridgehead &quot;to allow the troops retreating from the defeat of Caporetto to cross the Piave.

==Monuments and places of interest==
*Archpriest Church
The archpriest&#x27;s church, the work of Giovanni Rossi, is dedicated to the Holy Name of Mary and probably dates back to before 1000, when the castle was built, and served both the small local population and the feudal lords. Formerly a chapel dependent on the parish church of Col San Martino, it became a parish towards the end of the 15th century. Between 1729 and 1748 it was rebuilt at the foot of the slopes of the castle hill, where the old church was located, now in ruins and isolated; the bell tower was built between 1857 and 1885. It suffered serious damage during the First World War, the only building of the entire complex that remained almost intact was the bell tower, probably useful to enemy forces as a point of reference. The bell tower contains a mighty concert of three bells plus a recall ring.

*Abbey of Santa Bona
Between 1107 and 1110 a certain Giovanni Gravone da Vidor founded a Benedictine abbey to house the relics of a Saint Bona which he had brought from the Holy Land during the first crusade.It represented a powerful institution, but ended up rapidly declining: in the 15th century it was definitively given in commendation to the Cornaro family and in 1773 the Serenissima decreed its suppression.
Almost completely destroyed during the Great War. It was restored in the 1920s and currently shows heavy signs of renovation.

*Castle area
At the site where the Vidor castle stood (destroyed in 1510), there is an ossuary monument commemorating the soldiers who fell during the world wars. The entire monument is dominated by a small temple dedicated to the Blessed Virgin of Sorrows, designed by the Venetian architect Brenno Del Giudice. This place can be reached via a path bordered by a via crucis. The locality, still called Castello today, hosts the Palio di Vidor every year, an event that recalls the numerous attacks that the fortress suffered in medieval times and beyond.

*Villa Vergerio
The complex is made up of some buildings, including the actual villa (rebuilt after the Great War) and the vast surrounding areas. Nearby stands the oratory of San Giuseppe, patron saint of the municipality, to which travelers who had to cross the Piave took their vows.

*Municipal building
Since 2010 the municipal headquarters has been located in the building of the former Innocente Zadra schools. It is an elegant and prestigious building built, at the behest of the Zadra family, in 1930 and inaugurated the following year. The external facades of the building are decorated with frescoes depicting symbols related to education and work. The entrance to the palace consists of three arches, with Corinthian style columns, equipped with ornamental wrought iron gates. Once past the entrance arches there is an elegant frescoed atrium.

==Economy== 
The area of Vidor, included in the Quartier del Piave, is known for its wine production, especially for the cultivation of Prosecco of Valdobbiadene. Still of some importance is the cultivation of corn and potatoes. Numerous small and medium-sized enterprises have given rise to the formation of industrial and craft areas, with the production of furniture being the most important. It was the headquarters of the Cassa Rurale ed Artigiana di Vidor which, after various vicissitudes, merged into the Banca della Marca. During the last century, the industrial production of the village was practically the monopoly of the Zadra silk factory. This Filanda-Setificio will operate until 1964 when it will have to close because of competition from China and other countries. Now renovated and become a sausage factory.

==Infrastructure and transport==
Located in the immediate vicinity of the bridge over the Piave built by the company Odorico &amp; C and inaugurated on 11 June 1870 to replace a previous ancient building that stood a little further downstream, the town of Vidor between 1913 and 1931 was located from the Covolo-Vidor station and the Vidor stop, located respectively south and north of the bridge itself, along the Montebelluna-Valdobbiadene Tramway, which at the time represented an important development tool for the economy of the area.

Today, public mobility is managed by the company Mobilità di Marca S.p.A. (MOM), in particular the lines to Valdobbiadene, Montebelluna, Pieve di Soligo and Conegliano pass through Vidor. In addition the municipal area is served by the tourist red line, &quot;Prosecco Hills Link&quot; which crosses the entire area of the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, connecting Conegliano, Vidor to Valdobbiadene.

<doc id="1047911" wikidata="Q5616814" url="?curid=1047911" title="Guitar Vader">
<text>was a Japanese underground indie rock band. Formed in 1998, the band is best known for their contributions to the soundtracks of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; games. The band disbanded in 2007.

Guitar Vader had two lead vocalists and songwriters, guitarist Miki Tanabe and bassist Ujuan Shozo. Tanabe&#x27;s childlike voice and Shozo&#x27;s tenor are often used in harmony and call and response, but many songs are sung exclusively by one or the other. Their music generally features pop-oriented melodies, often coupled with aggressive power chords and hard rock influences, and sometimes playfully shifts between genres in mid-song. Band members claimed influences like Nirvana, The Beatles, The Pixies and the Ramones, as well as lesser influences like Air and Guitar Wolf. Others have likened their sound to bands as disparate as The B-52&#x27;s and Smashing Pumpkins.

==History==
Tanabe and Shozo first met in Kawasaki, Kanagawa while the two were in different bands. The two became friends, and after their other bands broke up, they decided to collaborate. Yuki Takumiya joined them as the band&#x27;s drummer. The trio began recording at Berry Records soon after, and in October 1998, they released their first cassette tape, a collection of four songs titled &quot;Guitar Vader Vol. 1&quot;. More than 1,000 copies were sold at an independent record store in Tokyo called High-Line. The tape was followed by another release, which sold another 1000 units. Empowered by their success, the two volumes were compiled along with new material and one remix onto the two tape set, &quot;Die Happy!&quot;. The album gained distribution in Tower Records and HMV stores, but was never released officially on CD. This gave the band, who only performed live shows irregularly, their first real exposure to a larger audience. Later that year, they released one more tape, containing three new songs, including the exclusive rarity &quot;Generation Revolution&quot;.

Following &quot;Die Happy!&quot;, Guitar Vader was asked to contribute original music to the Dreamcast game RoomMania No. 203, a life sim following a virtual college student. Guitar Vader contributed ten songs to the game&#x27;s extensive soundtrack. The successful release of the game suddenly skyrocketed Guitar Vader&#x27;s profile and the need for a proper CD release became increasingly apparent.

It was around this time that the band departed from the lo-fi recording sensibilities of their earlier work with their second album &quot;Wild at Honey&quot; (a reference to the Beach Boys album &quot;Wild Honey&quot;) containing two songs from &quot;Guitar Vader Vol. 3&quot; and new material. Shortly thereafter, the band released a single, &quot;Beach Panic&quot;, containing two songs. Following its completion, drummer Takumiya left the band.

Video game composer Hideki Naganuma was among the many who discovered Guitar Vader through the &quot;Die Happy!&quot; tapes. A lover of underground music, Naganuma decided that they would be a perfect fit for the upcoming game &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, set in an alternate-reality version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The game was widely praised for its soundtrack, which prominently featured Guitar Vader&#x27;s song &quot;Magical Girl&quot; in the opening tutorial, and &quot;Super Brothers&quot; (another &quot;Die Happy!&quot; track) in a later stage.

In 2000, Guitar Vader began work on their third album, &quot;From Dusk&quot;. Joined by Suzuki Yoshifumi on drums, the album marked a major evolution for the band, particularly for its prominent use of keyboards, played by producer Taichi Ohira, as well as its more polished, melodic sound. The album was released in early 2001, and although it was not a big seller, the album remains Guitar Vader&#x27;s commercial peak. &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; was released in 2002, and featured a song from the album, &quot;Baby-T&quot; as well as a remix (by Naganuma) of &quot;I Love Love You,&quot; which had previously been released on the remix album &quot;Remixes GVR&quot;.

After the acquisition of Berry Records by Sony Music, Guitar Vader became increasingly unhappy with their contract, in particular their lack of ownership of their music, low royalties, and inability to get a new album released. At the time, both members of the band still worked part-time jobs to earn their living. The band left Berry in 2003 and formed an independent label, Plugs House. They built their own studio and produced a fourth album, &quot;Dawn&quot;. The release marked a continued evolution of the band&#x27;s sound, with synths and programming performed by Shozo. In 2003, the band also played two shows in England, hosted by Pixelsurgeon, their only shows outside Japan.

To replicate these songs in live performances, the band recruited American keyboardist Steve Laity. Although Laity was made an official member of the band, he only appeared in live performances, not on the band&#x27;s albums. In October 2004, Guitar Vader released what would be their final album, &quot;Happy East&quot;. It continued the expanded sound of &quot;Dawn&quot; with an eclectic mix of songs, including an electronica instrumental &quot;Suspense&quot; that marked the only song of its kind in the band&#x27;s catalog. 

In 2006, the band began work on another album, and had nearly completed it, when Shozo suffered a vital heart infection that left him hospitalized for months, with continuing health issues long after. The band cancelled their first scheduled concert in the United States at that year&#x27;s FanimeCon. Although the album was either completed or close to completed, a falling out between Tanabe and Shozo prevented its release, despite pressure from Yoshifumi and Laity to release it. In 2007, Laity confirmed on Guitar Vader&#x27;s message board that the band had disbanded and a &quot;very large rift&quot; had formed between the band&#x27;s two key members. No official announcement was ever made.

<doc id="1047920" wikidata="Q695178" url="?curid=1047920" title="Louis Duchesne">
<text>Louis Marie Olivier Duchesne (; 13 September 1843 – 21 April 1922) was a French priest, philologist, teacher and a critical historian of Christianity and Roman Catholic liturgy and institutions.

==Life==
Descended from a family of Breton sailors, he was born on 13 September 1843 in Saint-Servan, Ille-et-Vilaine, Place Roulais, now part of Saint-Malo on the Breton coast, and was orphaned in 1849, after the death of his father Jacques Duchesne. Louis&#x27; brother, Jean-Baptiste Duchesne, settled in Oregon City, Oregon in 1849.

Louis Duchesne was ordained to the priesthood in 1867. He taught in Saint-Brieuc, then in 1868, went to study at the École pratique des Hautes Études in Paris. From 1873 to 1876, he was a student at the &quot;École française&quot; in Rome. He was an amateur archaeologist and organized expeditions from Rome to Mount Athos, to Syria, and Asia Minor, from which he gained an interest in the early history of the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1877, he obtained the chair of ecclesiastical history of the Catholic Institute, but left the theological faculty in 1883. He then taught at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, where he influenced Alfred Firmin Loisy, a founder of the movement of Modernism, which was formally condemned under Pope Pius X. In 1895, he was appointed director of the &quot;École française&quot;.

In 1887, he published the results of his thesis, followed by the first complete critical edition of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;. At a difficult time for critical historians applying modern methods to Church history, drawing together archaeology and topography to supplement literature and setting ecclesiastical events with contexts of social history, Abbé Duchesne was in constant correspondence with like-minded historians among the Bollandists, with their long history of critical editions of hagiographies. He gained fame as a demythologizing critical historian of the popular, pious lives of saints produced by Second Empire publishers.

In 1888, he became a member of the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, and in 1910, he was elected to the Académie française. Abbe Duchesne was made an apostolic prothonotary in 1900.

As editor of the &quot;Bulletin critique du littérature, d&#x27;histoire et de théologie&quot;, Duchesne kept up with current intellectual developments.

He also wrote &quot;Les Sources du martyrologe hyéronimien&quot;, &quot;Origines du culte chrétien&quot; (translated as &quot;Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution&quot; and often reprinted), &quot;Fastes épiscopaux de l&#x27;ancienne Gaule&quot;, and &quot;Les Premiers temps de l&#x27;État pontifical&quot;. These works were universally praised, and he was appointed a commander of the Legion of Honor. However, his &quot;Histoire ancienne de l&#x27;Église&quot;, 1906‑11 (translated as &quot;Early History of the Christian Church&quot;) was considered too modernist by the Church during the &quot;Modernist crisis&quot; and was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1912.

The London &quot;The Tablet&quot; said,By his rigid application of scientific methods of research and judgment, by his caustic tongue and pen, Mgr. Duchesne was regarded by some as a scoffer and a vandal among pious traditions. But by those who knew him, he was regarded as a master of the sciences which are auxiliary to ecclesiastical history.

He died in 1922, in Rome, and is buried in the cemetery of Saint-Servan.

<text>The Adventures of Leucippe and Clitophon (), written by Achilles Tatius in eight books, is the second-longest of the five surviving Ancient Greek romances, and the only one to exhibit genuine humour.

==Plot summary==
===Sidon and Tyre===

I. Landing in Sidon after a storm, an unnamed narrator visits the local temple, to make an offering of thanks to Astarte, the Phoenician goddess of love. He sees there a painting depicting the rape of Europa by Zeus disguised as a bull. The pair are led by Eros (Cupid) and the narrator exclaims how that little boy dominates land, sea and sky. He is unexpectedly answered by a handsome young man, Clitophon, who explains that he is a case in point: he has suffered many blows at the hands of Love. Intrigued, the narrator begs him for his tale. Clitophon agrees reluctantly, and leads his new friend to a grove of plane trees, where he begins his story.

Clitophon explains that he is from Tyre, and is the son of Hippias, whose half-brother Sostratus lives in Byzantium. Shortly after his 18th birthday his father decides that Clitophon should marry his half-sister, Calligone. Alarmed by this prospect, Clitophon has a nightmare in which he imagines himself joined to Calligone from the waist down, but they are cut apart by Medusa brandishing a sickle. Although alarmed by this portent, he believes it signifies that Fate has destined another to be his mate.

Hippias receives word from Sostratus that war has broken out between Thrace and Byzantium. He sends his wife Panthea and his daughter Leucippe to Hippias for safe-keeping. When Clitophon sees Leucippe disembarking on the beach, he is immediately smitten by her stunning beauty. His father arranges a meal for his new guests and seats Clitophon next to Leucippe. This excites the young man further, and he spends the entire meal gazing at her in a daze. Not knowing what to do, he confides his love to his older cousin Clinias. Clinias offers him only a few tips, explaining that Love is really a self-instructed expert, and he should trust his instincts. As they are talking, Clinias’ lover Charicles bursts in, complaining that he is being married off to an ugly girl. Clinias consoles him, and Charicles goes off riding on a horse Clinias had given him to take his mind off the marriage. Later, in the midst of their continued discussion, a servant announces that Charicles has been killed in a tragic riding accident. Clitophon consoles his friend, and after attending Charicles’ funeral he returns to the house determined to make an amorous approach to Leucippe.

He finds her taking a stroll with her mother in the garden, which is in full bloom, with the birds and crickets contending in making music. When Leucippe and Panthea stop to examine a peacock trying to attract his mate, Clitophon launches into a philosophical discussion with a slave of his household, Satyrus, about how love is a fundamental force of nature. He explains that love can occur not only between people, but also between birds, snakes, trees, rivers, and even rocks. The examples get ever more absurd, and Leucippe is charmed by the explanation of two magnetic rocks that are drawn together by ‘love’. She then retires to the house with her mother for her lyre recital.

II. During the recital a bee flies in and stings Clio, Leucippe&#x27;s maid. Leucippe sings a charm taught to her by an Egyptian woman over the place where the bee had stung, and Clio declares that she feels much better. This gives Clitophon an idea. For the next ten days they glance at each other over dinner, but under the watchful eyes of their parents they can make no further move. Clitophon approaches Satyrus, who explains that Clio has fallen in love with him, and will help contrive a private meeting for him with the maiden. However, when he finally finds himself alone with her in the garden he is at a loss for words, until a bee buzzes around his face. He swats it away and then pretends to be stung on the face, on the lips. Leucippe soothes him with her Egyptian charm, singing it over his lips, which he turns into a kiss. After initially resisting, she kisses him back, but they are disturbed by an approaching servant.

Satyrus helps develop the relationship further. He exchanges their cups at dinner, allowing them to ‘kiss’ under the noses of their parents by touching with their lips the place on the cup where the other had drunk. He also arranges another meeting in the garden.

Meanwhile, troubled by dreams, his father hurries on Clitophon&#x27;s marriage to Calligone. Her dress is purple and decorated with gold, her jewelry also expensive. However, the preliminary sacrifice to Aphrodite in the garden does not go well. The offering is stolen by an eagle, who flies off towards the beach. The soothsayers advise Hippias to sacrifice again to Zeus on the beach at midnight to avert the bad omen.

Leucippe had once been pursued unsuccessfully by a certain Callisthenes, a rich but profligate young man of Byzantium. According to the laws of that city, if a man raped a virgin he could be forced to marry her as punishment. So he got himself appointed as holy ambassador for a pilgrimage to Tyre. When Leucippe&#x27;s mother goes to the ceremony with Calligone, he assumes the young woman is Leucippe, and points her out to his servant Zeno. When Hippias performs his midnight sacrifice on the beach, Zeno goes ashore with eight men disguised as women, who grab the torches of Hippias’ party and extinguish them, and in the dark carry off Calligone to Callisthenes’ ship. They set sail for Byzantium, thinking they have kidnapped Leucippe.

With his marriage to Calligone now impossible, Clitophon begs Leucippe to perform the ‘mysteries of Aphrodite’ with him. She agrees, but only if they can meet in her bedroom at night. However, Panthea sleeps across the corridor, and access to that part of the house is barred by a locked door, and guarded by the eunuch Conops. Satyrus obtains a copy of the key and befriends Conops, discussing with him fables about gnats (the meaning of Conops’ name), and then offers him a meal with a spiked drink that puts him to sleep. Satyrus at once informs Clitophon, who unlocks the door and enters Leucippe&#x27;s bedroom with the assistance of Clio. Unfortunately, Panthea wakes up, having had a nightmare about a robber slitting open her daughter&#x27;s belly with a sword. In a panic she enters Leucippe&#x27;s bedroom and discovers that she is not alone, but Clitophon escapes in the dark without being recognised.

Panthea assumes that Leucippe&#x27;s virginity has been stolen, and takes out her rage on Clio. She accuses Leucippe of complicity, but she denies it, suggesting it was a slave, demigod or burglar, and reassures her mother that her virginity is still intact. She did not cry out because she was paralysed by fear. Suspecting that Clio will be forced to reveal the plot in the morning, Satyrus and Clitophon take her by night to Clinias’ house. He advises Clitophon to elope to Alexandria, if he can persuade Leucippe. Satyrus and Clinias agree to accompany them, and Clio is sent away to safety at Clinias’ suggestion.

In the morning Panthea seeks out Clio, but she has disappeared. Again she accuses Leucippe of knowing her attacker. Leucippe is distraught by her mother&#x27;s accusations, and when Satyrus tells her of the plan to elope to Alexandria she agrees, threatening to kill herself otherwise. A few days later Clinias arranges for a carriage to come to the house at dusk. They all get on and press on through the night, reaching Sidon by midnight and the port of Berytus (Beirut) at dawn. They catch a ship bound for Alexandria.

On board they meet Menelaus, an Egyptian who has just completed three years’ exile in Phoenicia for accidentally killing his male lover in a boar hunt. Clinias sympathises with him, having lost Charicles in similar circumstances. Clitophon suspects that Clinias, with Menelaus’ support, will now embark on his usual tirade against women, and questions why homosexuality has become so fashionable. A philosophical argument ensues between Clitophon and Menelaus, arguing the case for heterosexual versus homosexual love. Clitophon says that the beauty of women is longer-lasting, but Menelaus counters that the charm of love lies precisely in its fleeting nature. Clitophon says that women&#x27;s bodies are built for intercourse with men. Their kisses are more skillful and their orgasms more powerful. Menelaus counters that women are all makeup, hair dye and perfume. He prefers the sweet smell of a boy&#x27;s sweat, and their kisses, which taste like nectar.

III. After three days at sea in gentle winds they are suddenly struck by a storm. Struggling to keep the ship afloat, they shift their baggage from one side to the other and begin throwing the cargo and even their baggage overboard. Eventually the captain gives the order to abandon ship. The crew climb into the lifeboat being towed behind, and suddenly cut the hawser, leaving the passengers to their fate. The ship hits a rock and breaks up. Clitophon and Leucippe cling to a fragment of the prow. They watch as Menelaus, Clinias and Satyrus drift away on separate pieces of wreckage. Clitophon prays to Poseidon, the storm abates, and they are washed up on the coast of Egypt near Pelusium in the eastern delta.

===Pelusium and Nicochis===
They enter the temple of Zeus where they admire two paintings: one of Andromeda being attacked by Cetus, and rescued by Perseus, the other of Prometheus whose liver is being torn out by an eagle, with Hercules aiming his bow at the bird, painted by an otherwise unknown artist Euanthes. The paintings are a hint about Leucippe&#x27;s fate. After waiting two days for their friends, who do not appear, they hire a boat for Alexandria which goes via the Nile. However, they have not gone far when they are attacked by bandits, who steal their money and shut them in a hut. Clitophon bewails the misery of their wedding, which he imagines he is now having with Leucippe: instead of necklaces she has ropes, the guard is her bridesman, their bridal chamber is a prison, etc., but Leucippe, mortified by her situation, says nothing.

At dawn a savage man arrives on horseback and takes Leucippe away, to be sacrificed as a virgin on behalf of the army. Clitophon is distraught, but the bandits force their remaining captives to move on. On the way, they are attacked by a small force of soldiers, who make light work of the bandits and free Clitophon. Their commander is Charmides, who enlists him in the army as a cavalryman and gives him an Egyptian servant.

On receiving some reinforcements, Charmides advances towards the bandit capital Nicochis, but his way is blocked by a ditch, on the other side of which thousands of bandits have built an altar to which they lead Leucippe. After preparing her for sacrifice, their priest slits open her belly and roasts her innards over the fire, then distributes them for eating. Clitophon is rooted to the spot by the horror of the spectacle, but she cannot be saved. The remains of Leucippe&#x27;s body are then placed in a coffin. By evening the soldiers are able to build a causeway and cross the ditch. Clitophon tries to kill himself over Leucippe&#x27;s coffin, when he spies Menelaus and Satyrus running towards him. Menelaus knocks on Leucippe&#x27;s coffin and she emerges unscathed. Clitophon is astonished, and Menelaus explains that after the shipwreck he and Satyrus were captured by the bandits but freed because some of them recognised him. Satyrus pleaded with Menelaus to save her, and he staged a conjuror&#x27;s trick using a knife with a retracting blade and a fake belly made of a sheep&#x27;s skin and sheep innards. Clitophon thanks Menelaus and adopts him as his firm friend.

Charmides decides not to attack before more reinforcements arrive, which have been delayed by the arrival of the Phoenix, a sacred bird from Ethiopia.

IV. Charmides moves the army to a nearby village, where Clitophon is allocated a house. Here Clitophon attempts to make love to Leucippe, but she rebuffs him, claiming that Artemis told her in a dream that she must remain a virgin until they are formally married. He admits that he had a similar dream, in which he was refused entry to the temple of Aphrodite by the goddess, but with a promise that he will later be made her priest.

While they are enjoying the spectacle of the hippopotamus, Charmides casts his eye on Leucippe. He asks Menelaus privately to bring Leucippe to his bedroom for a fee of 50 gold pieces. Menelaus refuses, and instead reports the story to Clitophon and Leucippe. They decide to tell the general that she will give him what he desires once they reach Alexandria, but right now she has her period. Charmides agrees, but asks to converse with her in the meantime, and even to kiss her, which infuriates Clitophon.

While they are negotiating this, Leucippe falls ill with an unexplained madness. When Menelaus and Clitophon ask her what is the matter she kicks them and struggles against them. When Charmides sees her, he suspects the illness is feigned and orders her tied up. Menelaus asks Charmides for the army doctor, who prescribes purging and sedation.

A message then arrives from the prefect of Egypt, urging Charmides to attack with the troops he currently has. They cross the causeway, and the bandits gather all their old men and send them out with branches of palm to make them look like suppliants. They offer the general a huge bribe to call off his attack. Charmides refuses, so the old men accept their fate and only ask to be killed in their village. Meanwhile, the bandits have been flooding the area around the causeway. When the old men retreat, they part ranks and let through their main force, which was hidden behind them. Isolated on the causeway and surrounded by water, the army is defeated, and Charmides is killed.

Back at the village Leucippe is still sick. A soldier called Chaereas offers to cure her. He explains that Gorgias, an Egyptian soldier (now dead), also fell in love with Leucippe and tricked her into drinking an aphrodisiac. Chaereas fetches an Egyptian doctor, who offers her a potion to cure her for four pieces of gold. Eventually Clitophon agrees and they administer the drug. Leucippe sleeps through the night and by morning is cured. In the meantime a large army is sent from Alexandria, which razes Nicochis to the ground. They resume their journey to Alexandria on the Nile, observing the crocodiles en route, and Chaereas accompanies them.

===Alexandria===
V. They arrive at Alexandria via the ‘Sun Gate’ and travel through the city from south to north, amazed by its beauty, its size and the number of its inhabitants. In the evening they watch the torch festival of Serapis and visit the temple of Zeus. Later they retire to the lodgings Menelaus has hired for them.

The next day Chaereas invites them to dinner in his house on Pharos for his birthday. However, as they are leaving, a hawk chasing a swallow strikes Leucippe&#x27;s head with its wing. They also notice nearby in a studio a painting depicting the story of Procne, Tereus and Philomela, in which Procne serves the body of her son Itys to Tereus for dinner as punishment for the rape of her sister Philomela. Menelaus says that because of these bad portents, they should postpone their journey to Pharos.

The next day Chaereas returns in the morning and they cannot put off the visit to Pharos any longer. They travel there by boat, leaving Menelaus behind, and visit the lighthouse. Then they retire to Chaereas’ house for dinner. However, it is a trap, as Chaereas harbours a secret passion for Leucippe. During the meal Chaereas leaves to go to the toilet and while he is absent armed pirates burst in to grab Leucippe. Clitophon is wounded in the thigh defending her, and cannot stop them from carrying her off in their ship. Hearing the commotion, the commander of the naval forces on Pharos offers to pursue the pirates in his warship. Gradually they close the distance, but when they get near, the pirate captain takes Leucippe bound onto the deck and yells out: ‘Is this the prize you seek?’ He then cuts off her head and throws the rest of her body overboard. Two sailors retrieve it and they resume the pursuit, but another pirate vessel appears and the naval commander is forced to retreat to Alexandria. 

When they reach the docks, Clitophon laments the fact that although he has the larger part of Leucippe&#x27;s body, the sea has the more important, smaller part. So, not knowing what else to do, he kisses the wound of her neck, and later buries her body. Over the next six months Clitophon recovers from his physical wound, but continues to mourn for the emotional loss of Leucippe.

One day he unexpectedly bumps into Clinias and they embrace one another. Clinias explains that after the shipwreck he was saved by some Sidonian merchants and returned to Tyre. There he discovered that Hippias had recently received a letter from Sostratus betrothing Leucippe to Clitophon. Hippias learned that Clitophon was in Alexandria, and Clinias agreed to go there and fetch the two lovebirds home. When Clitophon tells him what has happened to Leucippe, Clinias is aghast and suggests that he return immediately to Tyre. However, Satyrus tells Clinias that there is a rich young widow of Ephesus, Melite, who has been importuning Clitophon for four months to accompany her home. Clinias also urges the union, and reluctantly Clitophon agrees, on condition that he will not be her husband in deed until he reaches Ephesus. She invites him to a sumptuous meal and although they kiss each other pleasurably he refuses to spend the night with her, citing their earlier agreement.

Clitophon boards a boat headed for Ephesus with Melite, Satyrus and Clinias, while Menelaus stays in Alexandria. Melite has hired a cabin on deck and when they are sleeping there she implores him to make love to her now, before they arrive in Ephesus. Clitophon maintains that they are travelling over Leucippe&#x27;s grave and he cannot bear to make love on a marriage bed rocked by the waves. Melite points out that Aphrodite herself was born from the sea foam, and around them are many positive portents, such as the ‘yoke’ where the yard and the mast join, like the yoke of marriage, and the curved sail like the belly of a pregnant woman. Clitophon reminds her of their agreement in Alexandria and holds her off for now.

===Ephesus===
After five days sailing they reach Ephesus. Her house is large and one of the most prominent in the city. Melite orders an elaborate feast for the evening, and in the meantime they set out to visit her country estate. While walking through the gardens, Melite is importuned by a wretched young woman, Lacaena from Thessaly, who was once free and is now a slave. She is wearing rags and her hair has been shorn off. She begs Melite to free her and tells her that her family will pay her ransom. She accuses Sosthenes, Melite&#x27;s overseer, of whipping her and trying to rape her. Melite summons Sosthenes, who is unable to explain himself beyond saying that he had bought her for 2000 drachmas from a slave dealer who got her from some pirates. Melite dismisses him and sends Lacaena to the house to recover. Clitophon is curious about this ‘Lacaena’, suspecting that she may actually be Leucippe.

Back at the house, Clitophon is tended by slaves and prepared for his dinner with Melite. During the meal Satyrus asks Clitophon to come aside for a moment. He shows him a letter written by Leucippe, accusing him of causing her much pain and asking him to ransom her, and to send her back to Byzantium. Confused as to how Leucippe can have survived, he writes her a reply swearing that he is still a virgin and begs her not to judge him in spite of his current situation.

On his return to the meal he excuses himself on the grounds that he is not feeling well. Melite follows him to bed and demands sexual gratification. He says he cannot do this right now, but promises to fulfil her wishes soon.

Melite enlists Leucippe, who she imagines is a Thessalian witch, to make a love-potion. Leucippe asks who it is for. Melite explains it is for her husband to be, who refuses to have sexual relations with her. Leucippe is delighted at the news and agrees to make the potion, knowing that it will be ineffective, since she knows nothing about it. She sets off to the cottage on the estate to gather herbs for the potion, accompanied by some maids.

That evening, while dining with Melite, they are both disturbed by Melite&#x27;s husband Thersander, who, it seems, is not dead after all. He has heard all about Clitophon, and grabbing him by the hair, rains down blows upon him. Suspecting that there may be some reason for this attack, Clitophon does not defend himself. Once Thersander tires of hitting him, Clitophon dusts himself down and asks ‘Who are you Sir, and why have you attacked me?’ Thersander is enraged by this impudence, and locks Clitophon in a storeroom.

After Thersander leaves in a huff, Melite notices Leucippe&#x27;s letter, which Clitophon had dropped in his struggle with Thersander. She reads it and suddenly realises who Lacaena is. In tears, she visits Clitophon in the storeroom, accusing him of being a ‘wet blanket’, of offering her only the pleasure of seeing him, of teasing her more cruelly than a pirate. She begs him for a one-time cure for her ailing heart. Taking pity on her, Clitophon makes love to her in the storeroom.

VI. Melite tells Clitophon where Leucippe is. She swaps clothes with him and gives him 100 pieces of gold. He sneaks out of the house, heading for the cottage on the estate, but soon runs into Thersander and Sosthenes. After publicly abusing him, they haul him off to prison, charging him with adultery. Later he is visited by Clinias and Satyrus, who tell him that Leucippe has gone missing.

Sosthenes tells Thersander that he has been saving a beautiful girl for him, and is told to take her to a private location. Sosthenes goes to the estate where he distracts the serving maids and seizes Leucippe. He then takes her to a hut in a secluded location, telling her that she is soon to become the mistress of her master. When Thersander arrives he is immediately smitten by Leucippe&#x27;s beautiful eyes. He tries to flatter her, but she just cries. He decides to return when she is in a better mood and asks Sosthenes to speak well of him in his absence.

On returning to the house Thersander accuses Melite of adultery and of freeing Clitophon. Melite denies the adultery, only saying that she was helping a shipwrecked trader who had lost his wife at sea.

Meanwhile, in the secluded hut Sosthenes tells ‘Lacaena’ what a lucky girl she is. Thersander is handsome, young, rich, of noble birth and very kind. Leucippe replies that his attempt to seduce her amounts to violation of a virgin in the sacred city of Artemis, and is also adultery. When Thersander returns, Sosthenes tells him that he has nearly won ‘Lacaena’ over. She is only worried about rejection should she once grant him what he desires. Outside the hut they hear Leucippe talking to herself, uttering her true name and declaring that Clitophon is her husband. Thersander vows to take Clitophon&#x27;s place and gain the love of both Melite and Leucippe. He goes inside and tries to win her over, but she resists his attempts to kiss her. Thersander becomes angry, accusing her of being a harlot, because she was brought here on a pirate ship. Leucippe denies it and swears that she is still a virgin. She dares them to bring out their wheels of torture, whips and fire. She will never surrender her free spirit.

VII. Thersander returns to the gaol and asks the gaoler to let him put a fake inmate in Clitophon&#x27;s cell, which he agrees to. This new inmate explains to Clitophon that he is accused of being accessory to the murder of a slave girl. He was on his way to Smyrna when he was befriended by a man who took him to an inn. Four ruffians grabbed both of them and started beating them up. Eventually his companion confessed to the murder of Lacaena, having been paid 100 gold pieces by Melite. The ruffians took the money but also accused his innocent companion of being an accessory. Clitophon asks about what happened to the girl&#x27;s body but the new inmate says he was not involved in her murder, and so does not know.

When Clinias visits the prison again, Clitophon tells him the story of the new inmate and also that he has resolved to revenge Leucippe&#x27;s apparent death by confessing to the murder himself, citing Melite as his accomplice. Clinias tries to dissuade him to no avail.

At the trial the next day Thersander presents the case for adultery against Clitophon and Melite, but Melite&#x27;s lawyers defend her well. Then Clitophon gets up and says that he and Melite plotted to kill Leucippe so they could be together and enjoy Melite&#x27;s wealth. Clinias defends him, explaining that Clitophon merely wishes to die, and so far there is no firm evidence of Leucippe&#x27;s death. Also, the testimonies of Sosthenes and the serving maids who were with Leucippe when she disappeared have not yet been taken. The court agrees and sends out messengers to summon both Sosthenes and the serving maids. Thersander counters by saying that no new witnesses are needed. He demands the immediate execution of Clitophon for a capital crime freely admitted, and with this opinion the court ultimately concurs.

Clitophon is brought outside into the agora, and stripped so he can be scourged. A wheel and a fire are prepared for the next gruesome stage in his torture and death. Clinias prays to the gods for help, and all seems lost when the high priest of Artemis approaches, leading a sacred embassy from Byzantium. At its head is Sostratus, the father of Leucippe. Since all sentences must be suspended until the sacred embassy has completed its sacrifice, Clitophon is temporarily released. This embassy was sent because Byzantium won its war with Thrace, as the Byzantines believe, with the help of Artemis. Also Sostratus was told in a dream by Artemis that he would find his lost daughter in Ephesus.

Recognising Clitophon, Sostratus asks of what crime he was accused. The bystanders say that he was condemned for killing Leucippe, and in anger Sostratus rushes at Clitophon, and tries to gouge out his eyes. However, Clinias stops him, arguing that if Artemis had said he would find his daughter here then she cannot be dead.

Meanwhile, back at the secluded hut a messenger from Thersander arrives to warn Sosthenes of the bailiffs coming to bring him to court. In fear, he jumps on his horse and makes for Smyrna, but forgets to lock the door. Leucippe escapes and runs to the temple of Artemis, where she throws her arms around the feet of the goddess. For free women to enter there the penalty is death, unless she is a virgin or a slave with a grievance against her master. And if the charge is proven she becomes a servant of the goddess, but otherwise returns to her master.

Back at the agora, a messenger arrives for the high-priest, telling him that a beautiful foreign girl is claiming sanctuary at the temple. Sostratus and Clitophon are overjoyed, believing her to be Leucippe. The high priest gives surety to the magistrate to return Clitophon when summoned, and they all travel to the temple. When they arrive, Leucippe leaves the shrine and embraces her father.

VIII. They re-enter the shrine, but Thersander arrives and accosts the high priest for releasing Clitophon from his bonds. He also demands the return of his slave girl Leucippe, calling her a harlot. Clitophon is enraged and picks a fight with Thersander, but has much the worst of it, and blood is spilt inside the sanctum. Unable to win his fight, Clitophon appeals to the high priest, who declares that Thersander&#x27;s actions are sacrilegious. The crowd drag away Thersander, who yells out that Clitophon is already condemned to death and Leucippe&#x27;s claim of virginity will be proven false in the grotto of the ‘Pan pipes’.

The high priest invites Clitophon and Leucippe to dinner. Clitophon tells him all of his adventures, except for the bit where he made love to Melite. He also defends Leucippe&#x27;s actions to her father. The high priest explains Thersander&#x27;s reference to the Pan pipes. Syrinx was a maiden thought to be equal to the gods in beauty. Pan pursued her into a thick wood, but she transformed herself into a bunch of reeds that blocked his path. Pan cut them down to find his beloved and only then realised that he had in fact killed her. Gathering the reeds up he cried over them and as he breathed on their ends they made a sweet sound. In memory of her Pan shut his new instrument in a cave. Later he gifted the spot to Artemis, on condition that only a pure maid could enter the grotto. If she is a real virgin a beautiful note will be played on the Pan pipes, and if not a groan is heard and after three days the priestess enters and finds the girl gone.

The following day Sostratus and the high priest perform the sacrifices of the sacred embassy, and Thersander then demands the return of Clitophon to the court. There he accuses Leucippe of being a whore who polluted the temple of Artemis, Sostratus of being her pimp, and Clitophon of being an adulterer and murderer. It does not matter if his victim is still alive, he says, the court order condemned him to death and it cannot be rescinded. He also attacks the high priest, accusing him of sleeping with Leucippe, and of turning the temple into a brothel. He likewise charges Melite with adultery and demands the confiscation of her dowry.

The high priest attacks Thersander for his immorality, and asks how Clitophon can be guilty of murdering Leucippe when she is obviously still alive.

Sopater, Thersander&#x27;s chief counsel, then repeats Thersander&#x27;s accusations against the priest and claims that the only mistake Thersander ever made in his life was misjudging the character of his wife, who has clearly committed adultery with Clitophon.

Thersander interrupts, issuing two challenges: one to Melite to swear an oath in the sacred water of Styx, that she has not had sexual relations with Clitophon during the period in which he was away. The second challenge is to Leucippe, that if she persists in declaring herself to be a virgin she should submit to the test of the Pan pipes. 
Leucippe immediately accepts her challenge and likewise Melite, since the requested oath does not cover the period during which Thersander was in Ephesus.

Leucippe enters the grotto of Pan, dressed in sacred robes. Clitophon waits outside worrying that Pan will take advantage of her, but the Pan pipes sound soon after and she emerges triumphantly from the grotto.

Melite&#x27;s test is to stand in the spring of the Styx with her oath inscribed on a tablet hung about her neck. If the water rises to cover the tablet she is lying, but the water remains low.

Sosthenes is also apprehended and sent to prison awaiting trial for his part in Thersander&#x27;s subterfuge. Thersander is banished from Ephesus by the court.

The high priest invites Leucippe and Clitophon again to dinner where she explains how she escaped death at the hands of the pirates. They had several prostitutes on board, one of whom resembled Leucippe. Chaereas suggested that they dress her in Leucippe&#x27;s clothes and then cut off her head, throwing her body overboard without the head, which they disposed of later. This ruse helped them escape and the pirates reckoned on getting a better price for Leucippe than for the prostitute. But when Chaereas insisted on keeping Leucippe as his prize, the pirate captain cut off his head as well.

Sostratus also explains what had happened to Calligone. After abducting her, Callisthenes found out that she was not in fact Leucippe, and apologised for the mistake, promising to respect her virginity. And this experience transformed him from a man of dissolute morality into a virtuous person.

Thersander disappears from Ephesus, and after the statutory delay of three days, fails to renew his claim against Clitophon, and so the court&#x27;s order for his execution lapses.

They sail to Byzantium, where Clitophon marries Leucippe, and then return to Tyre, where Callisthenes celebrates his marriage to Calligone.

==Date==
Of the six papyrus copies, the oldest is P. Oxy LVI 3836, originally dated by Parsons to the second century. This date was later firmed up by Cavallo to the first half of the second century, and more recently by Del Corso to the first quarter of the second century. If this dating is accepted for the earliest surviving copy of the romance, then its original composition may plausibly be pushed back to the end of the first century.

All attempts to date the novel based on its vague internal historical references or on stylistic grounds have so far failed to win general acceptance.

However, the connection of the &quot;bucoli&quot; (literally ‘herdsmen’, bandits) rebellion of 167/8 CE to 171/2 CE with A.T.’s story deserves separate treatment. First noticed by Altheim, the statement in IV.18.1 that from Alexandria a large military force was dispatched to raze the city of the &quot;bucoli&quot; to the ground, is also described in Dio Cassius (LXXI.12.4) and in the Historia Augusta (Marc. Aurel. XXI, 2). Dio Cassius relates how the &quot;bucoli&quot; captured a friend of a centurion, and after swearing an oath over his entrails, devoured them, just as the &quot;bucoli&quot; did to Leucippe&#x27;s supposed entrails (II.15.5). A.T. gives the name of the bandit capital as Nicochis (IV.12.8), and this name also appears in Papyrus Thmouis 1, which appears to describe the same &quot;bucoli&quot; rebellion. Furthermore, A.T. seems to concur with the papyrus in locating Nicochis in the Mendesian nome, near Thmouis, because of his description of the journey by boat from Pelusium to Alexandria. There are only two possible routes: via Memphis or via the Butic canal. A.T. doesn&#x27;t mention Memphis, the second-largest city in Egypt, and when the bandits waylay them he says the river there is ‘very narrow’ (III.9.3) and their captain had to back water, rather than turn around or pole out into deeper water. It is clear they are on the Butic canal, which passes through the Mendesian nome, rather than on the much larger Pelusic branch of the Nile. These strong allusions suggest that Achilles Tatius based this part of his novel on recent historical events. 

The problem with this otherwise conclusive theory is the much earlier date of the papyri of A.T. (ca. 120 CE). So the destruction of Nicochis (IV.18.1) cannot be based on a historical event. How many times can you raze a city to the ground? The destruction of Nicochis in A.T. is therefore fictitious, a just punishment meted out by the novelist to the evil bandits who nearly killed Leucippe, just as he does to all the other villains in the story: Thersander, who is banished from Ephesus (VIII.15.2), Charmides and Gorgias who are killed in the battle (IV.14.4, IV.15.3), Chaereas who gets his ‘just punishment’ being beheaded by pirates (VIII.16.4), and Sosthenes who is thrown into jail (VIII.15.2).

== Analysis ==
The first appraisal of this work comes from Photius’ &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, where we find: &quot;the diction and composition are excellent, the style distinct, and the figures of speech, whenever they are employed, are well adapted to the purpose. The periods as a rule are aphoristic, clear and agreeable, and soothing to the ear&quot;. To this Photius added a moralistic bias that would long persecute the author: &quot;the obscenity and impurity of sentiment impair his judgment, are prejudicial to seriousness, and make the story disgusting to read or something to be avoided altogether.&quot; Past scholars have passed scathing comments on the work, as in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica which brands the novel&#x27;s style artificial and labored, full of incidents &quot;highly improbable&quot;, and whose characters &quot;fail to enlist sympathy&quot;. Today&#x27;s judgements tend to be more favorable, valuing the elements of originality that the author introduces in the genre of the romance.

The most striking of these elements may be the abandonment of the omniscient narrator, dominant in the ancient romance, for a first person narration. To this is added the use of &quot;ekphrasis&quot;: the novel opens with an admirable description of a painting of the rape of Europa, and also includes descriptions of other paintings such as Andromeda being saved by Perseus and Prometheus being liberated by Heracles. The story, we are told, is inspired by this image, but is not based on it, in contrast to &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;, a romance which also opens with an ekphrasis, but instead of being inspired by the painting is in fact an interpretation of the painting, making the whole novel a form of ekphrasis.

Achilles Tatius takes pleasure in asides and digressions on mythology and the interpretation of omens, descriptions of exotic beasts (crocodiles, hippopotami) and sights (the Nile delta, Alexandria), and discussions of amorous matters (such as kisses, or whether women or boys make better lovers). His descriptions of confused and contradictory emotional states (fear, hope, shame, jealousy, and desire) are exemplary (&quot;baroque&quot; conceits such as these would be frequently imitated in the Renaissance). There are also several portrayals of almost sadistic cruelty (Leucippe&#x27;s fake sacrifice and, later, decapitation; Clitophon chained in prison or beaten by Melite&#x27;s husband) that share much with Hellenistic sculpture (such as the &quot;Dying Gaul&quot; or the &quot;Laocoön and his Sons&quot;).

==The romance&#x27;s modern editions==

The large number of existing manuscripts attests the novel&#x27;s popularity. A part of it was first printed in a Latin translation by Annibale Della Croce (Crucejus), in Lyon, 1544; his complete translation appeared in Basel in 1554. The first edition of the Greek original appeared in Heidelberg, 1601, printed together with similar works of Longus and Parthenius; another edition was published by Claudius Salmasius in Leiden, 1640, with commentary. The first important critical edition came out with Friedrich Jacobs in Leipzig, 1821.

There are translations in many languages. The first English translation was William Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Most Delectable and Pleasaunt History of Clitiphon and Leucippe&quot;, first published in 1597 and reprinted in 1923, when only 394 copies were printed. it was followed by those of Anthony Hodges (1638), R. Smith (1855), Stephen Gaselee (1917), J. J. Winkler (1989), and Tim Whitmarsh (2001).

A first partial French translation (most likely based on the Latin edition) appeared in 1545 by Philibert de Vienne. The first complete French translation was published in 1568 by François de Belleforest.

In 2005 a Portuguese translation, &quot;Os Amores de Leucipe e Clitofonte&quot;, was published as part of the &quot;Labirintos de Eros&quot; book series of translations of ancient Greek novels which was issued by Edições Cosmos of Lisbon. That translation was made by Abel Nascimento Pena, a professor of classics at the University of Lisbon, and included a preface by Marília Pulquério Futre Pinheiro.

==Influence==
Literary parallels have been found between &quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot; and the Christian &quot;Acts of Andrew&quot;, which are roughly contemporary compositions.

A copy of &quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot; was held in the extensive library of the Byzantine provincial magnate Eustathios Boilas in the eleventh century.

&quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot; is the key source for &quot;The Story of Hysmine and Hysminias&quot;, by the 12th century AD Greek author Eustathius Macrembolites (or Eumathius). This book was frequently translated in the Renaissance.

&quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot; is also imitated in &quot;Historia de los amores de Clareo y Florisea&quot; by the Spanish writer Alonso Nuñez de Reinoso (Venice, 1552). This novel was translated into French as &quot;Les Amours de Florisee et Clareo et de la peu fortunee Ysea&quot; by Jacques Vincent (Paris, 1554).

A French adaptation of Achilles Tatius’ novel (with significant changes) was published as &quot;Les adventureuses et fortunees amours de Pandion et d’Yonice&quot; (1599) by Jean Herembert, sieur de la Rivière.

<text>Daphnis and Chloe (, &quot;Daphnis kai Chloē&quot;) is a Greek pastoral novel written during the Roman Empire, the only known work of second-century Hellenistic romance writer Longus. 

==Setting and style==
It is set on the Greek isle of Lesbos, where scholars assume the author to have lived. Its style is rhetorical and pastoral; its shepherds and shepherdesses are wholly conventional, but the author imparts human interest to this idealized world. &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; resembles a modern novel more than its chief rival among Greek erotic romances does, the &quot;Aethiopica&quot; of Heliodorus, which is remarkable more for its plot than for its characterization.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; is the story of a boy (Daphnis) and a girl (Chloe), each of whom is abandoned at birth along with some identifying tokens. A goatherd named Lamon discovers Daphnis, and a shepherd called Dryas finds Chloe. Each decides to raise the child he finds as his own. Daphnis and Chloe grow up together, herding the flocks for their foster parents. They fall in love but, being naive, do not understand what is happening to them. Philetas, a wise old cowherd, explains to them what love is and tells them that the only cure is kissing. They do this. Eventually, Lycaenion, a woman from the city, educates Daphnis in love-making. Daphnis, however, decides not to test his newly acquired skill on Chloe, because Lycaenion tells Daphnis that Chloe &quot;will scream and cry and lie bleeding heavily [as if murdered].&quot; Throughout the book, Chloe is courted by suitors, two of whom (Dorcon and Lampis) attempt with varying degrees of success to abduct her. She is also carried off by raiders from a nearby city and saved by the intervention of the god Pan. Meanwhile, Daphnis falls into a pit, gets beaten up, is abducted by pirates, and is very nearly raped by a drunkard. In the end, after being recognised by their birth parents, Daphnis and Chloe get married and live out their bucolic lives in the country.

== Characters ==

The characters in the novel include:
*Astylus – Dionysophanes&#x27; son
*Chloe – the heroine

==Text tradition==
Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, about a page of text was missing; when Paul Louis Courier went to Italy, he found the missing part in one of the &quot;plutei&quot; (an ancient Roman reading desk or place for storing manuscripts) of the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence. However, as soon as he had copied the text, he upset the ink-stand and spilled ink all over the manuscript. The Italian philologists were incensed, especially those who had studied the pluteus giving &quot;a most exact description&quot; (&quot;&quot;) of it.

==Influences and adaptations==
The first vernacular edition of &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; was the French version of Jacques Amyot, published in 1559. Along with the &quot;Diana&quot; of Jorge de Montemayor (published in the same year), &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; helped inaugurate a European vogue for pastoral fiction in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; was the model of &quot;La Sireine&quot; of Honoré d&#x27;Urfé, the &quot;Aminta&quot; of Torquato Tasso, and &quot;The Gentle Shepherd&quot; of Allan Ramsay. The novel &quot;Paul et Virginie&quot; by Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre echoes the same story.

Jacques Amyot&#x27;s French translation is perhaps better known than the original. The story has been presented in numerous illustrated editions, including a 1937 limited edition with woodcuts by Aristide Maillol, and a 1977 edition illustrated by Marc Chagall. Another translation that rivals the original is that of Annibale Caro, one of those writers dearest to lovers of the Tuscan elegances.

The 1952 work &quot;Shiosai&quot; (&quot;The Sound of Waves&quot;), written by the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima following a visit to Greece, is considered to have been inspired by the Daphnis and Chloe myth. Another work based on it is the 1923 novel &quot;Le Blé en herbe&quot; by Colette.

===Opera===
* Joseph Bodin de Boismortier wrote a &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; pastorale in 3 acts in 1747
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau worked on but did not finish a &quot;pastorale heroïque&quot; under the same title between 1774 and 1776
* Jacques Offenbach in 1860 completed a one-act operetta based on the ancient novel

===Ballet===
* Maurice Ravel wrote what he called a &quot;symphonie chorégraphique&quot; bearing the title Daphnis et Chloé in 1912 for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes; its choreographer that year was Michel Fokine; at nearly sixty minutes, it is the composer&#x27;s longest work, and two orchestral suites from it are regularly played
* Ravel&#x27;s work was choreographed by Frederick Ashton for a staging by Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet (now The Royal Ballet) at Covent Garden on 5 April 1951, with Margot Fonteyn as Chloe and Michael Somes as Daphnis; decor was by John Craxton
* John Neumeier choreographed the Ravel for his Frankfurt Ballet company
* Jean-Christophe Maillot in 2010 created a contemporary and sensual choreography of 35 minutes of the Ravel for Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo; this featured Jeroen Verbruggen as Daphnis, Anjara Ballesteros-Cilla as Chloe, Bernice Coppieters as Lycenion and Chris Roelandt as Dorcon, directed by Denis Caïozzi and produced by Telmondis and Mezzo; it premiered on April 1, 2010, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco and has since been broadcast internationally

=== Art ===

* Marc Chagall produced a series of 42 color lithographs based on the tale of Daphnis and Chloe.
* Aristide Maillol (1861-1944) published a portfolio titled &quot;Daphnis et Chloe&quot; (1937) which features 49 woodcuts illustrating the story.

===Cinema===
* The work was adapted into a 64-minute silent film by Orestis Laskos in 1931, one of the first Greek cinema classics. The movie was originally considered shocking due to the nudity in some of the scenes.
* The story was the basis for the 1963 film Μικρές Αφροδίτες (&quot;Mikres Afrodites&quot;), or &quot;Young Aphrodites&quot;, by the Greek filmmaker Nikos Koundouros, based on a script of Vassilis Vassilikos.
* The story was adapted into a movie in 1993 by the Russian filmmaker Yuri Kuzmenko. It starred Lyubov Polishchuk as Daphnis&#x27; biological mother.

===Radio===
The work was adapted into a 45-minute radio play in 2006 by Hattie Naylor.

<text>Buddha is an unincorporated community in Guthrie Township, Lawrence County, Indiana. The local pronunciation of the name has traditionally been &quot;&quot;boo&quot;-dee&quot;, rhyming with &quot;Judy&quot;, though younger residents often pronounce it in line with the religious figure.

==History==

Though it was once known as Flinn&#x27;s Crossroads, the origin of the town&#x27;s current name is a subject of debate. The most prevalent story is that the name was suggested by a traveling salesman who stopped at the hamlet&#x27;s store when it was only known by the street crossing that marked the downtown. Similarly, another story suggests the town was named for a rail traveling hobo who frequented the area. According to the story, the man was referred to as Buddha due to his short, heavy stature. Another story states that the name derives from some of the first settlers in the area, an English family named Bodey that operated a supply port on the East Fork of the White River one mile south of the crossroads, in what is now called Rivervale. That is supposedly how &quot;Boo-dee&quot; came about and eventually evolved into its present name. Buddha is the home of the White River Baptist Church, The Buddha store has been closed for several years but the name remains faded on the white block building that has been the site of a store and trading post for many generations Nearby Carlton Cemetery is the resting place of the remains of many pioneers of the area.

==Geography==
Buddha is located at the intersection of Lawrence County&#x27;s Tunnelton and Old Buddha Roads. The East Fork of the White River is a little over a mile south and west of town, while Guthrie Creek is a mile to the north and east. The local terrain is hilly with patches of forest filled with sinkholes and many caves and caverns.

<doc id="1047931" wikidata="Q6306725" url="?curid=1047931" title="Julia Sears">
<text>Julia Ann Sears (1839–1929) was a pioneering academic and suffragist, achieving a milestone early in her career as she became the first woman to head a public college in the United States, in 1872. The school was Mankato Normal School, now Minnesota State University, Mankato, which named a residence hall after Sears in 2008. Sears was an active suffragist in Tennessee.

== Overview ==
1. East Dennis, Cape Cod, Massachusetts: Birthplace

2. Bridgewater State University: 1859 Graduate

3. Minnesota State University: President 1872-1873

4. Minnesota Historical Society, St. Paul

5. Peabody College, Vanderbilt University: Professor and Head of Mathematics Department, 1875 - 1907

6. Fairhaven, Massachusetts: Retirement

== Family history ==
The Sears family lineage begins with Richard Sares, who arrived in Yarmouth, Massachusetts in around 1630. The Sears family also includes Edmond Sears, who, in 1849, composed &quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear&quot;. Most of the notable members of the Sears family had an educational or religious backgrounds. Constant, Sears&#x27; father, was a sea captain who retired to become a cranberry farmer and salt manufacturer. Overall, the Sears&#x27; Family consists primarily of sea captains, religious figures in the Methodist and Baptist faiths, as well as educators.

== Early life ==

Julia Ann Sears was born to Constant and Deborah Chipman Sears on March 19, 1839, in East Dennis, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Julia was the second youngest of six siblings: Thankful Snow, Emily, Sarah R., Betsey Thomas, and Amanda. Her mother had another daughter, who died in 1832. Julia had no uncles or brothers. As children, Julia and her sisters underwent religious training by Methodist ministers, at month-long summer camps. In her later years, Sears recalled pretending to be a teacher when playing with friends.

== Education ==
Julia Sears attended a common school in East Dennis, from age five to age fifteen. She then most likely attended the East Dennis Academy from 1854 to 1858. During this time, Julia decided she wanted to be an educator. Sears moved away from home and attended Bridgewater Normal School from 1858 to 1860. Students were asked to affirm their devotion to becoming a teacher or they would be charged $10 for every term they attended the school. During her time at Bridgewater Normal School, Sears worked closely with the principal, Marshall Conant. Conant had a passion for mathematics, astronomy and mechanics, and possibly influenced Sears&#x27; later career choice of becoming a mathematics professor. At the end of her education, Julia Sears received a General Diploma of the Institution, similar to a modern-day GED.

== Teaching ==
Between 1860 and 1866 Julia Sears taught at a normal school in Cape Cod. In 1866, Sears was a teacher in Western State Normal School, later to be named Farmington State Normal School. The principal of Western State Normal School was George M. Gage, but in 1868 he moved to Mankato, Minnesota. Julia Sears had known George Gage, as a schoolmate, at Bridgewater Normal School. After Gage&#x27;s departure, Sears went to teach at Prescott School for Boys and Girls in Charlestown, Boston. From 1869 to 1871, Sears was the Head Assistant in Boston. In the summer of 1870, George Gage offered Sears the position of Head Assistant at Mankato Normal School, but Sears refused this offer. During this time, Sears studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Mankato Normal School==
Julia Sears started teaching at the Mankato Normal School, now known as Minnesota State University, in 1871. After only one year, Sears made history by becoming the principal in 1872. At this point in history, this kind of achievement was not well documented or communicated well. For the next 50–80 years, there are documents of other women believed to be the first female presidents of a U.S. public college.

Her first address to its female graduates was forthright, stating:

You are stepping out into life at a time when you hear not the sound, &#x27;thus far in education may you go and no farther, this place you may fill, but not that&#x27;; but, instead, universities and colleges open wide their doors and bid you enter, and any place you are fitted to fill is no longer denied you.

However, such frankness was still controversial, and she was forced to leave the university after only a year. She retained considerable support among the students and the Mankato community. This support shifted into a protest, becoming so heated that it resulted in expulsions and was known as the Sears Rebellion.

She then took a post as professor of mathematics at Peabody Normal School (now Peabody College of Vanderbilt University) in Nashville, Tennessee. In Nashville, she worked tirelessly as an advocate of women&#x27;s rights and in particular the right to vote. She remained at Peabody until her retirement in 1907, and a portrait of her, painted in 1904, hangs today in the Peabody library.

At her death in 1929, the campus newspaper said, &quot;Her precision, her accuracy, her fairness, her brilliant demonstrations, and, above all, her ability to inspire the ambition of all those she taught became famous incidents of her instruction at Peabody.&quot; This quote was inscribed on the wall of a newly constructed residence hall that was named in her honor at Minnesota State University, Mankato in 2015, and is a reminder of her impact on the community.

<text>The Solomon Islands men&#x27;s national football team is the national football team of Solomon Islands, administered by the Solomon Islands Football Federation. The Solomon Islands national football team was founded in 1978. They were officially recognised by FIFA a decade later, in 1988.

==History==
During the 2004 Oceania World Cup qualification/Oceania Cup the team drew 2–2 with Australia and qualified for the second leg. In the second leg, the Solomon Islands national men&#x27;s team were thrashed by Australia 5–1 and 6–0 in the two matches, with Australia qualifying for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.

The Solomons got a second chance against the Socceroos in a two-legged series in September 2005, this time with the winner advancing to a two-legged series against CONMEBOL&#x27;s fifth-place finisher for a berth in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and the team was thrashed by Australia 7–0 on the first leg and 2–1 in the second played at home.

The Solomons were knocked out of the 2010 FIFA World Cup – having got off to a good start winning every game in their qualifying group and comfortably progressing to the knockout rounds, defeats to New Caledonia and then to Vanuatu saw them knocked out of the competition.

In 2012, the Solomon Islands held the 2012 OFC Nations Cup which was also the second round of World Cup qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup where they finished in fourth place after qualifying through to the knockout stage by defeating Papua New Guinea and having draws against Fiji and New Zealand. They lost in the semi-final after they lost to the champions Tahiti after Jonathan Tehau scored the only goal. They later lost to New Zealand in the third-place playoff. The third round of World Cup qualifying saw the team finish bottom of the group after only taking one win against Tahiti.

After first taking charge of the team in 2017, Spaniard Felipe Vega-Arango was appointed for his second stint in June 2021.

In 2019, they went on a three-week training tour in Netherlands.

In June 2023, Solomon Islands played their friendly match against Southeast Asia countries, Singapore and Malaysia. Solomon Island won the 2023 MSG Prime Minister&#x27;s Cup after winning against Papua New Guinea (3–1), Vanuatu (1–0) and New Caledonia (1–0) as Raphael Lea&#x27;i clinch the golden boots as the tournament top scorer with four goals.

<doc id="1047933" wikidata="Q667084" url="?curid=1047933" title="The Von Bondies">
<text>The Von Bondies are an American rock band formed in 1997. The band&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Pawn Shoppe Heart&quot;, was released in 2004 and features the singles &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; and &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot;.

The Von Bondies have headlined tours of the United Kingdom/Europe, Australia, and the United States, taking along supporting bands like The Kills, Kasabian, Franz Ferdinand, Modey Lemon, SSM, The Subways, The Stills, Hot Panda and The Donnas. They have also appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The group disbanded in July 2011. They reformed in 2020 and planned a reunion tour, but those plans had to be abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band&#x27;s members have since become involved in other musical projects.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Lack of Communication&quot; (1997–2001)===

In 1997, Jason Stollsteimer and Marcie Bolen attended a concert by The Cramps and the Japanese garage punk band Guitar Wolf. At the time, Stollsteimer was working a job as a bowling alley bartender and Marcie as a hairdresser. The performance spurred them to create their own band, Baby Killers, which toured with fellow Detroit bands The Detroit Cobras, The Go, and The White Stripes. After recruiting Don Blum on drums and Lauren Wilcox on bass, the band changed their name to The Von Bondies. The band got their break by playing a New Year&#x27;s Eve show in Detroit, Michigan, in 2000. In attendance at the show was Long Gone John, owner of the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. This led the quartet to recorded the singles &quot;It Came from Japan&quot;, an ode to Guitar Wolf, and &quot;Nite Train&quot;.

Jack White produced the Von Bondies&#x27; debut album, &quot;Lack of Communication&quot;, in late 2001. It was recorded in three days in a similar process to that of a live album. It was released in the US by Sympathy for the Record Industry, and in the UK by Sweet Nothing Records. The hidden bonus track was a cover of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot;, with Bolen on lead vocals.

===&quot;Pawn Shoppe Heart&quot; (2002–2008)===
The group relocated to a San Francisco recording studio in early 2002 with producer Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads to begin work on their next album. In 2003, the band released the live &quot;Raw and Rare&quot; through Dim Mak Records. On the evening of December 13, 2003, an altercation occurred between Stollsteimer and the White Stripes frontman Jack White during the record release party for the band Blanche at The Magic Stick (a Detroit music club and part of the Majestic Theater complex). Stollsteimer was treated for injuries at Detroit Receiving Hospital. Detroit police arrested White and the Wayne County prosecutor&#x27;s office charged him with aggravated assault. White pleaded guilty to assault and a judge sentenced him to anger management classes.

In 2004, the band released their breakthrough album, &quot;Pawn Shoppe Heart&quot;, on Sire Records. &quot;Pawn Shoppe&quot; was produced by Harrison and co-produced by Stollsteimer. The album reached a peak of No. 36 in the UK Albums Chart, and No. 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart and stayed in that chart for eight weeks. The hit single from this release was &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot;, which reached No. 25 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and garnered national radio play. &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; reached No. 21 and &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot; reached No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2006, founding member Bolen left the band. Alicia Gbur and Matt Lannoo of The Nice Device were touring members of the band from 2007 to 2008. In 2008, the band signed with indie label Majordomo Records, joining label mates The Airborne Toxic Event and Earlimart.

===&quot;Love, Hate and Then There&#x27;s You&quot;, disbanding, and reunion plans (2009–present)===
The Von Bondies&#x27; third album, &quot;Love, Hate and Then There&#x27;s You&quot;, was released on February 3, 2009. The lineup at the time was Jason Stollsteimer on vocals and lead guitar, Don Blum on drums, Christy Hunt on rhythm guitar, and Leann Banks on bass guitar. The band released a limited-edition 7-inch single of &quot;Pale Bride&quot; from the album, backed with the non-album song &quot;Falling in Love&quot;. This was the first time that a Von Bondies album saw Don Blum co-write with Stollsteimer. &quot;Love, Hate&quot; was produced by Jason Stollsteimer, with three songs by Butch Walker and three songs by Rick Parker. All songs were written by Jason Stollsteimer, except &quot;Blame Game&quot; and &quot;Earthquake&quot;, which were co-written by Stollsteimer and Blum.

The group disbanded in July 2011. They reformed in 2020 and planned a reunion tour, but those plans had to be abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band&#x27;s members have since become involved in other musical projects.

<doc id="1047940" wikidata="Q16276646" url="?curid=1047940" title="Herman (name)">
<text>Herman is a masculine given name, from an ancient Germanic name consisting of the elements &quot;harja-&quot; &quot;army&quot; and &quot;mann-&quot; &quot;man&quot;. Hermine is the feminine form of &quot;Herman&quot;.
It is first recorded in the 8th century, in the forms &quot;Hariman&quot;, &quot;Heriman&quot;, &quot;Hairman&quot;, &quot;Herman&quot;.

It regained popularity in the English-speaking world in the 19th century, particularly in the United States amongst German Americans.

&quot;Herman&quot; remains widely used in Dutch and Scandinavian languages. Variant forms include German &quot;Hermann&quot;; French &quot;Armand&quot;; Italian, Spanish and Portuguese &quot;Armando&quot;; Italian &quot;Ermanno&quot;.

Herman has also been in use as a German surname since the 16th century.

The name of &quot;Arminius&quot;, the 1st-century leader of the Cherusci, became identified with the name &quot;Hermann&quot; in German historiography in the early modern period; thus, Arminius is traditionally known as &quot;Hermann der Cheruskerfürst&quot; in German. The name of &quot;Arminius&quot; is in fact from a stem &quot;ermen-&quot; &quot;strong&quot;. The conflation of this element with the name &quot;Herman&quot; may indeed date to the medieval period, via variant forms such as &quot;Ermin, Ermen, Erman, Ermanno&quot;, feminine &quot;Ermina, Ermana, Hirmina, Hermena&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, Muirhead&#x27;s inequality, named after Robert Franklin Muirhead, also known as the &quot;bunching&quot; method, generalizes the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.

==Preliminary definitions==

===&quot;a&quot;-mean===

For any real vector

:formula_1

define the &quot;&quot;a&quot;-mean&quot; [&quot;a&quot;] of positive real numbers &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; by

:formula_2

where the sum extends over all permutations σ of { 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; }.

When the elements of &quot;a&quot; are nonnegative integers, the &quot;a&quot;-mean can be equivalently defined via the monomial symmetric polynomial formula_3 as
:formula_4
where ℓ is the number of distinct elements in &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;k&quot;1, ..., &quot;k&quot;ℓ are their multiplicities.

Notice that the &quot;a&quot;-mean as defined above only has the usual properties of a mean (e.g., if the mean of equal numbers is equal to them) if formula_5. In the general case, one can consider instead formula_6, which is called a Muirhead mean.

; Examples
* For &quot;a&quot; = (1, 0, ..., 0), the &quot;a&quot;-mean is just the ordinary arithmetic mean of &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
* For &quot;a&quot; = (1/&quot;n&quot;, ..., 1/&quot;n&quot;), the &quot;a&quot;-mean is the geometric mean of &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;. 
* For &quot;a&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;, 1 − &quot;x&quot;), the &quot;a&quot;-mean is the Heinz mean.
* The Muirhead mean for &quot;a&quot; = (−1, 0, ..., 0) is the harmonic mean.

===Doubly stochastic matrices===
An &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;P&quot; is &quot;doubly stochastic&quot; precisely if both &quot;P&quot; and its transpose &quot;P&quot;T are stochastic matrices. A &quot;stochastic matrix&quot; is a square matrix of nonnegative real entries in which the sum of the entries in each column is 1. Thus, a doubly stochastic matrix is a square matrix of nonnegative real entries in which the sum of the entries in each row and the sum of the entries in each column is 1.

== Statement ==

Muirhead&#x27;s inequality states that [&quot;a&quot;] ≤ [&quot;b&quot;] for all &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 for every &quot;i&quot; ∈ { 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; } if and only if there is some doubly stochastic matrix &quot;P&quot; for which &quot;a&quot; = &quot;Pb&quot;.

Furthermore, in that case we have [&quot;a&quot;] = [&quot;b&quot;] if and only if &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; or all &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; are equal.

The latter condition can be expressed in several equivalent ways; one of them is given below.

The proof makes use of the fact that every doubly stochastic matrix is a weighted average of permutation matrices (Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem).

===Another equivalent condition===
Because of the symmetry of the sum, no generality is lost by sorting the exponents into decreasing order:

:formula_7

:formula_8

Then the existence of a doubly stochastic matrix &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; = &quot;Pb&quot; is equivalent to the following system of inequalities:

:formula_9

(The &quot;last&quot; one is an equality; the others are weak inequalities.)

The sequence formula_10 is said to majorize the sequence formula_11.

== Symmetric sum notation==
It is convenient to use a special notation for the sums. A success in reducing an inequality in this form means that the only condition for testing it is to verify whether one exponent sequence (formula_12) majorizes the other one.

:formula_13

This notation requires developing every permutation, developing an expression made of &quot;n&quot;! monomials, for instance:

:formula_14

==Examples==
=== Arithmetic-geometric mean inequality ===
Let
:formula_15
and
:formula_16

We have
:formula_17
Then
: [&quot;aA&quot;] ≥ [&quot;aG&quot;],
which is
:formula_18
yielding the inequality.

=== Other examples ===
We seek to prove that &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 ≥ 2&quot;xy&quot; by using bunching (Muirhead&#x27;s inequality).
We transform it in the symmetric-sum notation:

:formula_19

The sequence (2, 0) majorizes the sequence (1, 1), thus the inequality holds by bunching. 

Similarly, we can prove the inequality

:formula_20

by writing it using the symmetric-sum notation as

:formula_21

which is the same as

:formula_22

Since the sequence (3, 0, 0) majorizes the sequence (1, 1, 1), the inequality holds by bunching.

<doc id="1047944" wikidata="Q233002" url="?curid=1047944" title="Two-phase electric power">
<text>Two-phase electrical power was an early 20th-century polyphase alternating current electric power distribution system. Two circuits were used, with voltage phases differing by one-quarter of a cycle, 90°. Usually circuits used four wires, two for each phase. Less frequently, three wires were used, with a common wire with a larger-diameter conductor. Some early two-phase generators had two complete rotor and field assemblies, with windings physically offset to provide two-phase power. The generators at Niagara Falls installed in 1895 were the largest generators in the world at that time, and were two-phase machines. Three-phase systems eventually replaced the original two-phase power systems for power transmission and utilization. Active two-phase distribution systems remain in Center City Philadelphia, where many commercial buildings are permanently wired for two-phase, and in Hartford, Connecticut.
==Comparison with single-phase power==
The advantage of two-phase electrical power over single-phase was that it allowed for simple, self-starting electric motors. In the early days of electrical engineering, it was easier to analyze and design two-phase systems where the phases were completely separated. It was not until the invention of the method of symmetrical components in 1918 that polyphase power systems had a convenient mathematical tool for describing unbalanced load cases. The revolving magnetic field produced with a two-phase system allowed electric motors to provide torque from zero motor speed, which was not possible with a single-phase induction motor (without an additional starting means). Induction motors designed for two-phase operation use a similar winding configuration as capacitor start single-phase motors. However, in a two-phase induction motor, the impedances of the two windings are identical. 

Two-phase circuits also have the advantage of constant combined power into an ideal load, whereas power in a single-phase circuit pulsates at twice the line frequency due to the zero crossings of voltage and current.

==Comparison with three-phase power==
Three-phase electric power requires less conductor mass for the same voltage and overall power, compared with a two-phase four-wire circuit of the same carrying capacity. It has replaced two-phase power for commercial distribution of electrical energy, but two-phase circuits are still found in certain control systems. 

Two-phase circuits typically use two separate pairs of current-carrying conductors. Alternatively, three wires may be used, but the common conductor carries the vector sum of the phase currents, which requires a larger conductor. The vector sum of balanced three-phase currents, however, is zero, allowing for the neutral wires to be eliminated. In electrical power distribution, a requirement of only three conductors, rather than four, represented a considerable distribution-wire cost savings due to the expense of conductors and installation.

While both two-phase and three-phase circuits have a constant combined power for an ideal load, practical devices such as motors can suffer from power pulsations in two-phase systems. These power pulsations tend to cause increased mechanical noise in transformer and motor laminations due to magnetostriction and torsional vibration in generator and motor drive shafts.

Two-phase power can be derived from a three-phase source using two transformers in a Scott connection: One transformer primary is connected across two phases of the supply. The second transformer is connected to a center-tap of the first transformer, and is wound for 86.6% of the phase-to-phase voltage on the three-phase system. The secondaries of the transformers will have two phases 90 degrees apart in time, and a balanced two-phase load will be evenly balanced over the three supply phases.

<doc id="1047945" wikidata="Q303848" url="?curid=1047945" title="Connaught Square">
<text>Connaught Square in London, England, was the first square of city houses to be built in Bayswater. It is named after a royal, the Earl of Connaught who was from 1805 until death in 1834 the second and last Duke of Gloucester &quot;and&quot; Edinburgh, and who maintained his fringe-of-London house and grounds on the land of this square and Gloucester Square. Its appearance is essentially the same as in the 1820s. Its south-east is 115 metres north of Hyde Park and the same west of Edgware Road. This point is WNW of Marble Arch, which sits on a very large green roundabout (including sculptures and public fountains) marking the western end of Oxford Street. Connaught Street runs along is northern end.

==Architecture==
Connaught Square&#x27;s architecture is primarily Georgian. Redevelopment was initially planned in the early 18th century and the first of its 45 brick houses was built in 1828 as part of the Hyde Park Estate by Thomas Allason. Having built the Square, Thomas Allason (1790-1852) and family remained living at no 1 Connaught until well past he death in 1852.

==Community==
Residents of Connaught Square hold an exclusive summer party in the central communal garden every year. The garden square is maintained by the owners of the adjoining properties who contribute to its upkeep, and in return are issued keys to the garden. Such gated gardens are a particular feature of this area of London. The horses of the Royal Artillery regularly do their early morning rides down Connaught Street.

==Notable residents==
In October 2004, serving Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie bought as their home a house on this square for £3.5 million; as at 2007 the policing of which was an all-hours rota giving at least four on-duty Metropolitan Police Service Diplomatic Protection Group officers.

Other famous residents have included:

* №5 - Nigel Balchin - author
* №14 - Marie Taglioni - ballerina (resident from 1875 until 1876)
* №15 - Fanny Kemble - actress, author, playwright and poet (resident from 1877 to 1879)

==Other buildings==
Aside from predominant residential use, the buildings host a very small primary school and doctor’s surgery. A garage specialises in classic cars on northern approach way Connaught Street. To the west are the shops of Connaught Village and a long-standing Chinese restaurant, which was among the many meeting places of high-level corrupt talks regarding Bruce Grobbelaar, footballer.

==In film, fiction and the media==
In fiction, Lionel Holland lives at №242 in the film &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;.

==Proximity to the Tyburn Tree==

The single-most frequented gallows, the Tyburn Tree, for public judicial execution in London, was nearby. Most sufficient-scale 18th century maps mark out an area by the edge of the top a very broad rise which is a block or so north along Edgware Road as having, in rough drawing to symbolise obsolescence, such a landmark tree. Relatedly, Oswald&#x27;s Stone or Ossulstone stood for centuries on the corner of Edgware Road and Oxford Street/Road (formerly also called Uxbridge Road), and was an equally prominent landmark of Middlesex and of the most populous hundred (see Hundred Court), providing a cultural focus and marking out the place of early meetings of the justices of the peace and lords of the many Ossulstone manors more generally. 

Peter Ackroyd recites a list of anecdotes and archaeological finds supportive of pre-18th century mass burials where much of Connaught Place stands. No greater evidence is given for second theory above.

<doc id="1047946" wikidata="Q7873632" url="?curid=1047946" title="USS S-37">
<text>USS &quot;S-37&quot; (SS-142) was an S-class submarine of the United States Navy. Her keel was laid down on 12 December 1918, launched on 20 June 1919, and commissioned on 16 July 1923.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-37&quot;″s keel was laid down on 12 December 1918 by the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 20 June 1919, sponsored by Miss Mildred Bulger, and commissioned on 16 July 1923.

==Operational service==

===1923===
After fitting out at Mare Island, &quot;S-37&quot; departed San Francisco Bay at the end of July 1923 and joined Submarine Division (SubDiv) 17 at San Pedro, California, on 1 August 1923. During August, September, and into October 1923, she conducted exercises and tests off the Southern California coast.

On the afternoon of 10 October 1923, while recharging her batteries in the harbor at San Pedro, &quot;S-37&quot; was rocked by an explosion in the after battery compartment. Two men were killed as dense black smoke and gas fumes filled the flame- and arc-lit room. Extensive material damage added to the difficulty of rescue operations, but three men were extracted from the compartment, one of whom died of his injuries before medical help arrived. Two of the rescuers were seriously injured.

Once it was determined no one remained alive in the compartment, the compartment was sealed to cut off the supply of oxygen to the fire. However, by 0500 on 11 October 1923, so much pressure had increased in the compartment it forced the main hatch open. The compartment was re-sealed for another five hours, but when it was opened at 1030, the fire reflashed. The crew shut the hatch again for another hour. At 1130, the compartment was successfully ventilated and cooled enough to allow the crew to enter safely. Temporary repairs were completed on 25 October 1923, and &quot;S-37&quot; headed to Mare Island, California, for permanent repairs. On 19 December 1923, she returned to duty at San Pedro.

===1924–1941===
In 1924, &quot;S-37&quot; moved south and, with her division, participated in Fleet Problems II, Fleet Problem III, and IV, which involved problems of fleet movements, conducted &quot;en route&quot; to the Gulf of Panama; Caribbean defenses and transit facilities of the Panama Canal; and movement from a main base to an advanced base, conducted in the Caribbean Sea. After completing Fleet Problem IV, her division remained in the Caribbean until early April 1924, when it again passed through the Panama Canal to return to the Pacific Ocean. Toward the end of April 1924, she returned to San Pedro, and, on 28 April 1924 she continued to Mare Island. There the submarines of her division, having been transferred to the United States Asiatic Fleet, prepared to cross the Pacific.

On 17 September 1924, SubDiv 17, accompanied by the submarine tender , departed San Francisco. On 26 September 1924, the ships arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and on 4 November 1924 they reached Manila Bay on the coast of Luzon in the Philippines. They operated from Cavite, Luzon, for 16 years. During most of that time, they worked as a division, spending the fall and winter months in the Philippines and deploying to the China coast for spring and summer exercises. During the late 1930s, however, hostilities increased in East Asia with the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, and the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s S-boat schedule was altered to include more individual exercises and cruises. The submarines ranged throughout the Philippines and Netherlands East Indies, and they made shorter deployments to the China coast. In 1940, the China deployments ended, and the submarines intensified their exercises and patrols in the Philippines and participated in joint United States Army-U.S. Navy war games. In 1941, &quot;S-37&quot; remained in the Philippines, operating in the Luzon area into the spring, in the Visayan Islands and Sulu Archipelago into the summer, and back in the Luzon area during the fall.

===World War II===

====1941====
On 8 December 1941 – which across the International Date Line in Hawaii was 7 December 1941, the day the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II – &quot;S-37&quot; was in Manila Bay. With receipt of the news of the Japanese attack, &quot;S-37&quot;, commanded by James C. Dempsey, prepared for her first war patrol. On the night of 9 December 1941, she cleared the Corregidor outer minefield, moved into the Verde Island Passage, and took station at Puerta Galera, Mindoro, where she remained on lookout duty until 17 December 1941. She then returned to Manila, replenished and refueled, and, on 19 December, headed back toward the Mindoro coast. On 20 December, she assumed patrol duties in Calavite Passage. On 21 December 1941, she shifted to the Verde Island Passage. On 27 December 1941, she reconnoitered Batangas Bay to investigate the detonation of fuel oil tanks and found only Filipino and American forces destroying the fuel oil supplies before they could be captured by the Japanese. On 28 December, while the noise of the exploding tanks continued, &quot;S-37&quot; investigated reports of Japanese landings in Balayan Bay, then proceeded toward Looc Bay to verify or disprove a similar rumor. Finding both bays empty, she began to make her way south. On 30 December 1941, she was off Panay.

====January 1942====
On 1 January 1942, &quot;S-37&quot; suffered a fire in the starboard main motor panel. Repairs were made that night. On 2 and 3 January she patrolled off the entrance to Basilan Strait. There, she sighted a Japanese submarine, but was unable to close the range. On 4 January, she took up patrol duty off Japanese-held Jolo Island. On 5 January, she developed leaks in the air supply piping to the starboard main motor panel. Makeshift repairs decreased the air leaks, and &quot;S-37&quot; remained in the Sulu district on 6 January. On 7 January, she continued south, toward Port Darwin. On 8 January, new orders arrived, and she set a course for Soerabaja, the Dutch naval base on the northeast coast of Java.

On 11 January 1942, Japanese forces moved on territory of the Netherlands East Indies, landing at Tarakan on Borneo and at Manado on Celebes. &quot;S-37&quot;, then off Stroomenkaap at the western end of Celebes&#x27;s northern peninsula, was ordered to make for the Borneo coast. She arrived on 12 January and, for the next three days, remained in the Tarakan area, searching for Japanese transports and cargo ships, while at the same time eluding Imperial Japanese Navy destroyers. On 15 January 1942, she was ordered to leave the area, and on 23 January, unable to transmit identification messages, she approached Madoera Strait and surfaced for recognition by Dutch patrol vessels. At 2118, she arrived in Soerabaja Roads on the coast of Java. By the end of January 1942, Japanese forces on Borneo had moved south into Balikpapan, while those forces located in the Celebes moved into Kendari.

====February 1942====
On 2 February 1942, &quot;S-37&quot; departed Soerabaja and headed back to Makassar Strait. By 5 February, she was off Cape William. The next day, she shifted southward to patrol the southern approaches to Makassar City, and, on the evening of 8 February 1942, she sighted a destroyer, which was thought to be an advance guard unit for Japanese forces &quot;en route&quot; to that city.

At 1800, the destroyer, which &quot;S-37&quot; allowed to pass unmolested, disappeared to the northwest. At 1813, &quot;S-37&quot; sighted the masts and upper works of three Japanese destroyers in column at a distance 5 nautical miles (9250 m) , estimated speed . A half-hour&#x27;s wait brought no transports or cargo ships into view, and &quot;S-37&quot; went after the destroyer formation. Moving on the surface, she closed the four destroyers in column, distance . All torpedoes were readied and, at 1946, she commenced her approach. A minute later, she sighted another, closer formation of four destroyers, distance , plus the dim outlines of three large ships resembling transports, distance 3 nautical miles (5500 m) , on a northerly course. It would turn out that &quot;S-37&quot; had found fifteen transports in convoy.

At 1951, &quot;S-37&quot; changed course to go after the transports. By 2010, however, the destroyers had increased speed to maintain cover for the transports as the formation turned and crossed ahead of the submarine at . By 2030, &quot;S-37&quot;, unable to gain an unimpaired shot at the transports, shifted to attack the destroyers. Between 2036 and 2040, she closed to point-blank range, , and launched one torpedo at each destroyer. Thirty seconds after firing the third torpedo, she observed a hit between the stacks of the third and, as black smoke rose, it buckled in the middle and formed a vee approximately above the bow and stern. (2,000 tons) was doomed. She was, however, the only ship lost from this force, and the only confirmed ship &quot;S-37&quot; sank.

The fourth destroyer sighted &quot;S-37&quot; as she fired her fourth torpedo and turned to starboard. At 2041, &quot;S-37&quot; dived and rigged for depth-charging. By 2043, the three remaining destroyers were overhead, their sonars pinging. &quot;S-37&quot; ran silent. Between 2050 and 2215, the searching destroyers dropped depth charges at 10- to 15-minute intervals. &quot;S-37&quot; reached as she evaded. By 2230, the destroyers had moved out of the area. &quot;S-37&quot; reloaded and resumed the hunt.

&quot;S-37&quot; remained in the area for another eight days, during which she sighted several Japanese ships. Her lack of speed precluded several attacks and, on 11 February 1942, faulty mechanisms in her old Mark 10 torpedoes caused them to sink before reaching their target. On 17 February, she passed the Paternoster Islands, and on 18 February she arrived off Lombok Strait. On 19 February, she patrolled in Lombok and Badoeng Straits, and on the morning of 20 February she received orders to return to Soerabaja. At 0500, she submerged and began making her way along the Bali coast. At 0615, she sighted three Japanese destroyers through her periscope on a northerly course, 3 nautical miles (5500 m)off. Astern of &quot;S-37&quot;, an obvious oil slick – the result of her going aground in the Lombok Strait – extended some in a glassy sea, but she remained undetected. Temporary repairs were soon reducing the oil slick. At 0700, when &quot;S-37&quot; sighted another destroyer patrol, the slick remained obvious but unnoticed. By 0830, &quot;S-37&quot; was avoiding sudden changes in depth which would aggravate the leak. The slick was minimized, but at 0915 a destroyer was heard on the starboard beam. Depth charges were dropped, and their explosions were followed by the detonation of aerial bombs. &quot;S-37&quot; went to .

The depth charging and bombing continued until 1200, when &quot;S-37&quot;′s crew heard heavy anti-aircraft fire. The destroyer was distracted, but at 1245 she apparently resumed her search for &quot;S-37&quot;. After dropping three more depth charges, the destroyer continued to ping until after 1400. At 1415, &quot;S-37&quot; went to periscope depth. The destroyer was off, but the seas had become choppy. No oil slick was visible.

&quot;S-37&quot; cleared Lombok Strait at 1500 and, 25 hours later, moored at the Soerabaja Navy Yard. Repairs began immediately, but the Japanese were moving on Java. So, too, was the sub command situation; &quot;S-37&quot; lost her skipper to , replaced by James R. Reynolds, and on 26 February, &quot;S-37&quot; was ordered out. Equipment and parts in the navy yard shops were recalled, stores from the limited supplies at the base were taken on and, after the return of two air compressor coolers, she got underway on the port main engine, as the ship&#x27;s force completed reassembly of the starboard. Electrical steering failures, breakdowns in the coolers, and a change of orders delayed her departure; but, on the afternoon of 27 February, she moved out and headed north to patrol between Bawean Island and the western channel into Soerabaja Roads.

That night, the Battle of the Java Sea raged over the horizon, and, early on the morning of 28 February, the S-boat closed a Japanese formation of two cruisers and three destroyers retiring victoriously from the scene. A fight for depth control, however, precluded an attack. At mid-day, she sighted a open boat from Dutch light cruiser , carrying sixty Allied survivors; although unable to accommodate all of them, she approached to take on casualties. Finding none, &quot;S-37&quot; took on the two American sailors among them, transferred provisions, dispatched enciphered messages on the boat&#x27;s location to ABDA headquarters, and resumed her patrol. That afternoon, she again attempted to attack an enemy formation, but was sighted and underwent a combined depth charging and aerial bombing.

====March 1942====
For the next week, &quot;S-37&quot; remained in the area. Depth charge and aerial attacks were frequent, each one aggravating the condition of worn parts and equipment and resulting in mechanical and electrical failures and in leaks through disintegrating manhole and hatch gaskets. On 6 March 1942, she headed for Western Australia. Her major leak, through the engine room hatch, had been slowed to every 20 minutes. &quot;S-37&quot; left a misleading oil slick toward Lombok Strait, then moved farther east before turning south. By 11 March 1942, she was clear of the East Indies, and on 19 March she arrived at Fremantle, Australia.

====April–June 1942====
In April 1942, &quot;S-37&quot; continued on to Brisbane, Australia, where she joined Task Force 42 and, after a desperately needed six-week overhaul, departed for her fifth war patrol. Clearing Moreton Bay on 22 June 1942, she was in the Bismarck Islands by the end of June 1942, and, after patrolling in St. George Channel, she moved toward New Hanover. On 7 July 1942, she shifted back to the New Britain coast to patrol in the Lambert Point area. There, on the afternoon of 8 July 1942, she sighted a Japanese merchant ship escorted by a submarine chaser. Closing, she fired three torpedoes at 1405. Three explosions followed, sinking the 2,776-gross register ton &quot;Tenzan Maru&quot;. &quot;S-37&quot; went to and ran silent on a northerly course as the submarine chaser dropped depth charges where the &quot;S-37&quot; had been.

====July–November 1942====
On 9 July 1942, &quot;S-37&quot; patrolled between Dyaul and New Hanover. On 10 July, she moved into the New Hanover-Massau traffic lanes, and on 11 July she closed the New Ireland coast and continued south. For the next two days, she operated in the Rabaul area, then headed for Cape St. George and Australia. From 14 July, when a fire in the starboard main motor was quickly extinguished, she was plagued by mechanical and electrical failures. On 20 July, she sighted Cape Moreton Light, and on 21 July she moored alongside the submarine tender in Brisbane harbor.

Between 17 August and 13 September 1942, &quot;S-37&quot; conducted her sixth war patrol, a defensive patrol in the Savo Island area in the Solomon Islands in support of U.S. forces fighting in the Guadalcanal campaign. On 2 September, she scored her only hit of the patrol when she damaged the last destroyer in a column of four which was steaming to the north of Savo. On 6 September, she moved into the Russell Islands, from which she departed the Solomon Islands and headed back to Brisbane. On 19 October 1942, she cleared Brisbane&#x27;s harbor for the last time, and on 23 October 1942 she arrived at Nouméa, New Caledonia. After refueling, she served on a picket line station in defense of Nouméa. On 5 November 1942, after a fire in her port main motor added to problems of tank trouble, fuel shortage, and mechanical failures, she headed for Pearl Harbor.

====1943–1945====
From Pearl Harbor, &quot;S-37&quot; continued on to San Diego, California, where she underwent an extensive overhaul during the winter of 1943. She remained at San Diego for the remainder of her career, employed as an antisubmarine warfare training ship through 1944.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
Decommissioned on 6 February 1945, &quot;S-37&quot; was stripped, and her hulk was supposed to be expended as an aerial bombing target off San Diego, but she broke her tow cable and sank on 20 February 1945, coming to rest at a depth of some . Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 February 1945. Salvagers unsuccessfully tried to retrieve the wreck of &quot;S-37&quot; for its scrap value, but lost her again off Imperial Beach, California, in of water at , where she remains to this day.

<doc id="1047949" wikidata="Q2245206" url="?curid=1047949" title="Power Pack">
<text>Power Pack is a superhero team consisting of four young siblings appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Louise Simonson and artist June Brigman, they first appeared in their own series in 1984, which lasted 62 issues, and have since appeared in other books. Power Pack is the first team of pre-teen superheroes in the Marvel Universe and the first team of heroes in comics to feature characters of that age operating without adult supervision. In 2005, the title was relaunched as a series aimed at younger readers—though this was eventually declared a separate continuity from that of the original series and the mainstream Marvel Universe.

The team consists of four siblings: Alex Power, Julie Power, Jack Power, and Katie Power. The dying alien called Whitey, a scientist of the Kymellian race, transfers one of his four superpowers to each of the Power children so they can save their planet from the alien conquerors known as the Zn&#x27;rx (also known as the Snarks). The children band together as the superhero team Power Pack. Along with fighting aliens and super-villains, the team&#x27;s stories were known for focusing on morality debates and social issues such as child abuse, homelessness, drug abuse, bullying, and the ethics of using excessive or lethal force in combat.
==Publication history==
===Original series===
During the early 1980s, Marvel Comics had a policy that all their editors should also be writers. Louise Simonson was encouraged to think of a series she could write, and eventually she pitched a team of pre-teen siblings with superpowers called Power Pack. Simonson later explained:
Simonson chose June Brigman as &quot;Power Pack&quot;&#x27;s penciler because of her talent for drawing children. The &quot;Power Pack&quot; series premiered in May 1984 (cover date August 1984) in a double-sized issue inked by Bob Wiacek. The series continued into 1991, during which time Brigman and Wiacek were replaced by Jon Bogdanove and Hilary Barta as principal artists. The &quot;Power Pack&quot; letters column, titled &quot;Pick of the Pack&quot;, printed drawings and jokes about the characters submitted by readers, an unusual practice for a Marvel title.

In the first story of the series, the alien Kymellian known as Whitey is fatally injured by the alien villains known as Snarks. He gives the four Power children his powers before dying. His mass control power goes to Jack, his energy and disintegration power goes to Katie, his ability to fly goes to Julie, and his control over gravity goes to Alex. In issue #25, the team&#x27;s powers are temporarily stolen, then returned but rearranged. Due to this &quot;power switch&quot;, each Power Pack child now has an ability wielded by one of their siblings, leading to a change in codenames. The Power Pack children finally switched their costumes to match their new powers in issue #47. In issue #52, another rearrangement of powers and codenames occurred.
Unlike superheroes such as Spider-Man or Batman who were orphaned, free agents, or teenagers often trusted to be on their own without supervision, Power Pack was made up of pre-adolescent siblings who had a close relationship with each other, as well as their supportive parents Jim and Maggie Power. Early in the series, the children decided to keep their powers and superhero activities concealed from their parents, believing it would cause them stress and worry. This decision led to several moral compromises and feelings of guilt for the Power Pack members whenever they had to lie to friends and family or allow harm to occur because helping could mean revealing their abilities. The question of whether or not the powers should be revealed was also an ongoing source of debate among the children. &quot;Power Pack&quot; readers also argued the matter out in the series letter pages. During Jon Bogdanove&#x27;s story &quot;Revenge of the Bogeyman&quot;, which served as a tie-in for the crossover Inferno, the parents learn their children are superheroes. In an epilogue to the story, writer Julianna Jones depicted Jim and Maggie Power as so overwhelmed by the situation that they increasingly suffer psychological breakdowns and become convinced that they are not fit parents for superheroes. To help the Power family, the New Mutants team convinces Jim and Maggie Power that they were deceived and their children were never superheroes. This restored the secret identity status quo and led Power Pack to keep their heroic lives a secret again.

Despite the characters of &quot;Power Pack&quot; being children, the series often dealt with mature issues. Many of the social problems of the 1980s found their way into the book&#x27;s storylines. Among the themes addressed were pollution, drug abuse, runaways, kidnapping, gun violence, bullying, orphanhood, and homelessness. Stories regularly depicted the Power children learning and debating how to use their potentially lethal powers responsibly, often on their own but sometimes with guidance from older heroes such as Spider-Man. In one early issue, Jack was wracked with remorse when he thought he had killed a man. In a later story arc, Katie seriously injures a Snark prince named Jakal, which causes her immense guilt and leads her to call herself a &quot;monster&quot;.

As the series went on, the children were shown to slowly age and mature. In issue #1, Alex is 12 years old, Julie is 10, Jack is 8, and Katie is 5. In issue #45, Julie graduates from elementary school with honors in English, and the story says she will join Alex at school 44 (an actual middle school existing in New York City).

The same year Power Pack debuted, the team appeared alongside Spider-Man in a special comic designed to discuss children targeted by sexual abuse. The one-shot issue, written by Louise Simonson, was distributed for free and reprinted in the comics sections of many major newspapers. Marvel continued the campaign by featuring the characters in print public service announcements. Later the same year, the writers used the Snark Wars storyline (wherein the children are kidnapped by the evil Snark alien race) to address the issue of child abduction. During the same storyline, photos of missing children were printed in lieu of the comic&#x27;s regular letters column. In 1989, the Power Pack teamed-up with Cloak and Dagger in a special graphic novel addressing teen homelessness and runaways. Hotline telephone numbers for Covenant House were printed on the back cover.

Along with Spider-Man and the duo of Cloak and Dagger, Power Pack frequently encountered members of the X-Men and New Mutants. In issue #16, they met Franklin Richards (son of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four), and in issue #17 Franklin became a part-time member of Power Pack himself. He joined on many other adventures, occasionally staying with the Power family for days at a time when his own family were off on adventures.

Starting with issue #34, the &quot;Power Pack&quot; series regularly rotated writers. Simonson wrote issues #35, #37, and #39–40, while John Bogdanove wrote issue #36, issues #42–43, and issues #47–52. Howard Mackie wrote issue #34, Julianna Jones wrote issues #38 and #44–45, Steven Heyer wrote #41, Terry Austin wrote issues #46 and #53, Judy Bogdanove wrote #54, and Dwayne McDuffie wrote issue #55. During Jon Bogdanove&#x27;s final issues, Franklin Richards returned as a regular member of the team.

Further changes involved Alex Power mutating into a Kymellian without explanation, forcing him to hide from his girlfriend Allison (who soon dates someone else) as well as from public life. The series was cancelled with issue #62. The final issue, printed in the fourth quarter of 1990 (cover-dated February 1991), depicted the team and their parents journeying into space together.

One year after the original series&#x27; cancellation, creators Louise Simonson and June Brigman teamed up for the one-shot issue &quot;Power Pack Holiday Special&quot; (published in fourth quarter of 1991, with a cover date of February 1992). The one-shot comic resolved the cliffhanger the series had ended on, restored the Power Pack&#x27;s original powers, and undid some of the changes to the characters done during the run by Michael Higgins and Tom Morgan. &quot;Power Pack Holiday Special&quot; also included a short comedy story involving an art style that evoked &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, and a short story that showed an older, teenage Julie dealing with romance and self-esteem issues.

The &quot;Power Pack&quot; stories were reprinted by Marvel UK beginning around 1986. It was Marvel UK&#x27;s practice at the time to use a less well-known series as a secondary story in a comic devoted to more recognizable characters, and &quot;Power Pack&quot; became the back-up &quot;strip&quot; in a run of Marvel&#x27;s licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; weekly &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. During this period, it was printed partly in black and white and partly in color, as was the main &quot;Star Wars&quot; strip. &quot;Power Pack&quot; subsequently became the back-up strip for the UK &quot;ThunderCats&quot; comic, where it remained until its eventual replacement by the &quot;Galaxy Rangers&quot; series.

===2000 miniseries===
A four-part &quot;Power Pack&quot; mini-series published in 2000 depicted the children as now being slightly older than when they had last been in the 1991 &quot;Power Pack Holiday Special&quot;. Katie was now in the fifth grade (having skipped two grades due to her intelligence), Jack had joined Julie in middle school, and Alex was now a teenager in high school. James and Maggie, the children&#x27;s parents, were now aware that their children were also the heroes of Power Pack and accepted it. The Power children now wore masks when in costume and their superhero activities were largely restricted to &quot;practice sessions&quot; in the forest around their new home in Bainbridge Island, from Seattle. The series once again pitted the Pack against Queen Mauraud and the Snarks.

===Return of Power Pack===
Joe Quesada announced in a &quot;New Joe Fridays&quot; column at Newsarama that Power Pack would be returning to the Marvel Universe in late 2007, after the events of &quot;Civil War&quot;. However, due to the various delays within their release shipping schedules for Marvel Comics, these plans were put on hold. A new Power Pack story was commissioned for the 2007 Marvel Holiday Special, which would have been the first original material featuring the full cast in the standard Marvel Universe since the 2000 mini-series. It was briefly summarized as &quot;Power Pack relives holidays past&quot; in official Marvel solicits, but the story was scrapped from the publication at the last minute, when it was decided to prioritize the recently canceled title &quot;The Loners&quot;, which featured Julie Power among its cast. A &quot;Loners&quot; story written by CB Cebulski ran in place of the Power Pack story, though the official solicitation information still listed the Power Pack story and description.

Three of the Power siblingsAlex, Jack, and Katieappear within &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #574 (2010) as guests celebrating Franklin Richards&#x27; birthday. They were all depicted as only slightly older than they had been in the 2000 mini-series, with Alex still a teenager. During the story, Alex was invited to join Reed Richards&#x27; Future Foundation. He then made frequent appearances in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series.

In 2020, a five-issue limited series written by Ryan North and illustrated by Nico Leon began publication as part of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Outlawed&quot; event.

&quot;Power Pack: Into The Storm,&quot; a monthly five-issue series written by Louise Simonson and penciled by June Brigman, began publication in January 2024.

==Fictional team history==
===At the beginning===
Alex (age 12), Julie (10), Jack (8), and Katie Power (5) were bright, normal American children living with their parents in a beachfront house in Virginia. Their father, Dr. James Power, was a physicist who discovered a process to generate energy from antimatter with the assistance of a converter, of which he made a prototype. The process was, however, known to several alien races to cause chain reactions and destroy planets, and Dr. Power&#x27;s knowledge of the process was discovered by Aelfyre &quot;Whitey&quot; Whitemane, a member of the horse-like Kymellian species. A similar accident destroyed the Kymellians&#x27; home planet.

Whitey tried to stop the experiment by warning the Powers, but was mortally wounded by his enemies, the reptilian Snarks, in the process. The Snarks kidnapped Dr. Power and his wife, Margaret, hoping to obtain the secret of antimatter. Whitey rescued the Power children and told them what was happening. Before dying, he passed his powers to them to complete his mission.

The children, with the help of Whitey&#x27;s &quot;Smartship&quot;, a sentient starship called Friday, managed to stop the antimatter test by stealing and destroying the converter and rescued their parents from the Snarks. They decided to continue being superheroes and to hide their powers from their parents. Alex took the codename &quot;Gee&quot;, Julie became &quot;Lightspeed&quot;, Jack became &quot;Mass Master&quot;, and Katie became &quot;Energizer&quot;. They wore costumes made for them by Friday, which were Kymellian spacesuits. The costumes were constructed of unstable molecules and could materialize and disappear on voice command.

After rescuing their parents, the entire family moves to New York City, where the team attempted to deal with normal &quot;kid problems&quot; such as bullies and loose teeth while battling some of the deadliest villains in the Marvel Universe. The Pack fought the villain Kurse on two occasions during &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;. They were also heavily involved in the events of the &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; and &quot;Inferno&quot; storylines. During the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, they descended into the sewers and fought Sabretooth.

The Pack&#x27;s two greatest enemies during the original series were the Snarks and Carmody/The Bogeyman. The Snarks generally attempted to kidnap the Power children and steal their powers. Carmody, James Power&#x27;s former employer, spotted the Power children when they stole the antimatter converter at the beginning of the series and became obsessed with revenge. At first, he tried to work with government agencies to prove the Powers were mutants. Later, he became the supervillain Bogeyman. After being thrown into Limbo by Magik, he returned in a demonic form and nearly killed the entire Power family before committing suicide.

Power Pack joined forces with Cloak &amp; Dagger, the X-Men and the New Mutants on numerous occasions.

The team took great pains to conceal their abilities from their family and &quot;normal&quot; friends. However, during &quot;Inferno&quot;, when confronted by the demonic Carmody, the children were forced to reveal their powers to save their parents. The discovery led Jim and Maggie to have mental breakdowns. They were restored to normal through the combined efforts of Mirage and Gosamyr, who convinced them that the superpowered children were clones created to protect them from Carmody and that the &quot;real&quot; Power children, who were powerless, had been taken away and guarded by the New Mutants until Carmody was defeated. This explanation placated their parents and, once they were reunited with their &quot;normal&quot; children, their minds healed themselves. The &quot;clones&quot;, which had been generated by Mirage, were then removed, making the children&#x27;s secret safe once again. This cover-up proved to be unpopular with readers, and was highly criticized in the comic&#x27;s letters column.

Another occasional member of the team was Franklin Richards, the son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who went by the name Tattletale while adventuring. James and Margaret Power were introduced to Franklin after the events of the Snark Wars, and befriended Reed and Sue Richards when Franklin was returned to Avengers Mansion. Subsequently, Franklin was often invited to stay with the Power family while his parents were away on missions. Although Franklin was a member of the group, the Fantastic Four had no knowledge of Power Pack until the end of the series; instead, they thought of the Power children simply as &quot;Franklin&#x27;s friends&quot;.

===End of the series===
Some time later, Alex underwent a transformation into a Kymellian, and Margaret Power began losing her mind. The Power family sought help for Margaret and Alex in various places, beginning with Reed Richards&#x27; lab, but their efforts were disrupted by the Red Ghost and his super apes.

The Power family traveled to the UK to try to find help for Margaret and Alex, but the institute was overrun by Nightmare and they encountered Excalibur. After that the Powers visited the Caribbean. The children planned to enjoy the sun and sand while their father consulted with colleagues but found themselves confronted with what seemed to be an alien attack on the beach where they were relaxing.

The family decided to abandon New York and fly with Friday to New Kymellia to seek help for Alex and his mother.

Both Alex and his parents had been replaced by &quot;pseudoplasm&quot; doubles by a renegade Kymellian Technocrat and his ally, the exiled Maraud (called Meraud in this storyline). The real Alex and his parents were being held captive in the Technocrat&#x27;s hidden satellite orbiting New Kymellia. Eventually, the other Power siblings learned the truth and rescued their family, switching powers several times as needed, and barely escaping from the satellite before it was destroyed by Maraud.

After recovering on New Kymellia, the Power family returned to New York with Friday. Each of the children was back in possession of their original power, and their parents remained unaware of their children&#x27;s powers and of Power Pack&#x27;s existence.

==Post-series==
===Alex, New Warriors and the Future Foundation===
The Kymellians had given Alex the ability to absorb the powers of his siblings into himself and thus use them all. With these powers, he joined the New Warriors superhero group under the name Powerpax, later Powerhouse. This caused some friction with Alex&#x27;s brother and sisters; even their parents noticed the heightened levels of hostility and forced the children to see a psychologist. Alex eventually gave the others&#x27; powers back; the four reverted to their original names (except Alex, who named himself &quot;Zero-G&quot; and Julie, who was now called &quot;Starstreak&quot;, the name Katie had chosen when she had Julie&#x27;s powers). Speedball later tried to recruit Alex back into the New Warriors. Alex politely refused, citing the conflicts his membership would cause among his siblings, though Katie offered her services, to Speedball&#x27;s chagrin.

At some point outside of any published story, their parents discovered that the children had superpowers and were active as superheroes. Why Power Pack&#x27;s parents could now retain this information without suffering mental trauma and insanity – thanks to telepathic manipulation by Byrel Whitemane that had previously been established as impossible to circumvent – has not been explained.

Following the events of the 2000 mini-series, Julie left the family home in unrevealed circumstances to try to become an actress in Los Angeles. Despite Julie&#x27;s departure from Power Pack, the team defeats Big Wheel. Katie is later seen in costume having beaten several A.I.M. agents unconscious, when Flatman and Doorman offered her membership in the Great Lakes Avengers but she declined, and Power Pack fight Grizzly in New Jersey, a sighting which is used as his alibi against charges that he robbed Madison Square Garden.

During Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot; event, Alex&#x27;s codename Powerhouse was briefly mentioned by Hindsight Lad, an ex-teammate who exposed the secret identities of many New Warriors. Alex is one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book &quot;&quot; #1.

He later joined Reed Richards&#x27; Future Foundation project, which allowed gifted children living within the Baxter Building to map out the outlook for their generation.

===Julie, Excelsior/Loners, Avengers Academy and Future Foundation===
Sometime after the events of the 2000 mini-series, Julie Power concluded that adventuring had deprived her of a normal childhood. She dropped out of high school, left her family, and moved to Los Angeles to become an actress. She joined Excelsior, a support group for &quot;former&quot; teenage superheroes, where she is once again known as Lightspeed. Excelsior&#x27;s first mission was to return the members of the Runaways to the foster care from which the children had absconded and ended with Excelsior battling Ultron. Though they are not seen on-panel, it is then established that Excelsior spend several months attempting to recapture the child cast of the Runaways, but are constantly thwarted by being ineffectual, getting roped into cleaning up after the Runaways&#x27; crimefighting exploits, and on occasion simply by being outsmarted by the Runaways.

The Loners are all registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, but consider themselves retired from super-heroics when they are not battling superpowered menaces or operating in public as superheroes attempting to capture runaway superpowered children. However, Julie later tells the rest of the group that she is not registered. While she is less intelligent and articulate than previously established, Julie reveals in &quot;Loners&quot; #4 that this is merely an affectation she adopts for the benefit of others – she pretends to be a &quot;dumb blonde&quot; to fit in with Los Angelenos. It had previously been established that Julie is a redhead, her &quot;blonde&quot; hair the result of using light hues in the production of the comic&#x27;s art to reflect the brighter climate of the west coast.

The Loners&#x27; support group has moved to New York City, where Julie is presumably seen, though not named, at recent meetings. As with the cast&#x27;s sudden relocation to Los Angeles from New York between the cancellation of their series and the beginning of &quot;Runaways&quot; volume 2, the move is not explained.

Julie was seen among the other young superheroes to arrive on the new campus for the Avengers Academy, where she is attending classes as a teacher assistant, under Quicksilver&#x27;s tutelage.

Sometime after Julie ended the relationship with Karolina Dean, she was dealing with her depression and dropping out of college; when Alex &amp; Dragon Man appeared in her apartment and recruited her on a rescue mission to help save the Foundation. Afterward, she joined the team as both teacher and Co-leader of the FF.

===TV pilot===
====Plot====
As the Power siblings get ready for a new school year, they must deal with typical kid issues while also balancing their lives as superpowered children when they learn of Dr. Mobius, a phantom that haunts an abandoned house.

====Cast====

* Nathaniel Moreau as Alex Power
* Margot Finley as Julie Power
* Bradley Machry as Jack Power
* Jacelyn Holmes as Katie Power
* Jonathan Whittaker as Dr. James Power
* Cheryl Wilson as Margaret Power
* Daniel DeSanto as Eddie
* Christian Masten as Harlan
* Rachel Wilson as Tina
* Charlene DiPardo as Rhonda
* Greg Swanson as Dr. Mobius
====Production====
Following the cancellation of the original comic, Paragon Entertainment Corporation and New World Television developed Power Pack into a live-action show for NBC&#x27;s Saturday Morning Kids block. While a pilot episode was made, the series was passed on and later picked up by Fox, which chose to broadcast it as a Saturday morning special, on September 28, 1991, rather than ordering an entire series. The 27-minute pilot has subsequently been aired on Fox Kids during the off-season. Minor alterations to the concept were made for the pilot, ranging from the children&#x27;s parents being aware of their superhuman abilities, Julie&#x27;s acceleration power being altered to her being able to move at superhuman speed and lacking the ability to fly, and the &quot;cloud&quot; aspect of Jack&#x27;s density power being eliminated in favor of him being able to shrink in size. Additionally, the children did not wear costumes.

===Other appearances===
* The Power Pack make non-speaking cameo appearances in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; episode &quot;Support Your Local Sky-Father!&quot;.
* In 2000, a project involving the Power Pack, among other properties, was announced as part a joint venture between Marvel Entertainment and Artisan Entertainment.

<doc id="1047953" wikidata="Q2882174" url="?curid=1047953" title="1.25-meter band">
<text>The 1.25-meter, 220 MHz or 222 MHz band is a portion of the VHF radio spectrum internationally allocated for amateur radio use on a primary basis in ITU Region 2, and it comprises frequencies from 220 MHz to 225 MHz. In the United States and Canada, the band is available on a primary basis from 222 to 225 MHz, with the addition of 219 to 220 MHz on a limited, secondary basis. It is not available for use in ITU Region 1 (except in Somalia) or ITU Region 3. The license privileges of amateur radio operators include the use of frequencies within this band, which is primarily used for local communications.

== History ==

The 1.25-meter band has a very long and colorful history, dating back to before World War II.

=== Pre-Cairo Conference ===
Some experimental amateur use in the U.S. was known to occur on the &quot;-meter band&quot; as early as 1933, with reliable communications achieved in fall of 1934.

=== The Cairo Conference ===
In 1938, the FCC gave U.S. amateurs privileges in two VHF bands: 2.5 meters (112 MHz) and 1.25 meters (224 MHz). Both bands (as well as 70 centimeters) were natural harmonics of the 5-meter band. Amateur privileges in the 2.5-meter band were later moved to 144–148 MHz (becoming the modern-day 2-meter band), and the old frequencies were reassigned to aircraft communication during World War II. At that time, the 1.25-meter band expanded to a 5 MHz bandwidth, spanning 220–225 MHz.

=== The VHF/UHF explosion ===
Amateur use of VHF and UHF allocations exploded in the late 1960s and early 1970s as repeaters started going on the air. Repeater use sparked a huge interest in the 2-meter and 70-centimeter (420–450 MHz) bands; however, this interest never fully found its way into the 1.25-meter band. Many amateurs attribute this to the abundance of commercial radio equipment designed for 136–174 MHz and 450–512 MHz that amateurs could easily modify for use on the 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands. There were no commercial frequency allocations near the 1.25-meter band, and little commercial radio equipment was available. This meant that amateurs who wanted to experiment with the 1.25-meter band had to build their own equipment or purchase one of the few radios available from specialized amateur radio equipment manufacturers. Many of the repeaters which have been constructed for 1.25-meter operation have been based on converted land-mobile base station hardware, often extensively modifying equipment originally designed for other VHF bands.

=== U.S. Novice licensees get privileges ===
By the 1980s, amateur use of 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands was at an all-time high while activity on 1.25 meters remained stagnant. In an attempt to increase use on the band, many amateurs called for holders of Novice-class licenses (the entry-level class at that time) to be given voice privileges on the band. In 1987, the FCC modified the Novice license to allow voice privileges on portions of the 1.25-meter and 23-centimeter (1.24–1.30 GHz) bands. In response, some of the bigger amateur radio equipment manufacturers started producing equipment for 1.25 meters. However, it never sold well, and by the early 1990s, most manufacturers had stopped producing equipment for the band.

=== U.S. reallocation ===
In 1973, the FCC considered Docket Number 19759, which was a proposal to establish a Class E Citizen&#x27;s band service at 224 MHz. The proposal was opposed by the ARRL and after the explosive growth of 27 MHz Citizen&#x27;s Band usage, the FCC dropped consideration of the docket in 1977.

In the late 1980s, United Parcel Service (UPS) began lobbying the FCC to reallocate part of the 1.25-meter band to the Land Mobile Service. UPS had publicized plans to use the band to develop a narrow-bandwidth wireless voice and data network using a mode called ACSSB (amplitude-companded single sideband). UPS&#x27;s main argument for the reallocation was that amateur use of the band was very sparse and that the public interest would be better served by reallocating part of the band to a service that would put it to good use.

In 1988, over the objections of the amateur radio community, the FCC adopted the &quot;220 MHz Allocation Order&quot;, which reallocated 220–222 MHz to private and federal government land-mobile use while leaving 222–225 MHz exclusively for amateur use. The reallocation proceeding took so long, however, that UPS eventually pursued other means of meeting its communications needs. UPS entered into agreements with GTE, McCall, Southwestern Bell, and Pac-Tel to use cellular telephone frequencies to build a wireless data network. With the 220–222 MHz band then left unused, the FCC issued parts of the band to other private commercial interests via a lottery in hopes that it would spark development of super-narrowband technologies, which would help them gain acceptance in the marketplace. In the 1990s and into the 2000s paging companies made use of the 1.25-meter band. Most all such use ended by the mid-2000s, with the paging companies being purchased by others and services moved to newer systems, or having gone out of business.

=== Canadian reallocation ===
Until January 2006, Canadian amateur radio operators were allowed to operate within the entire 220–225 MHz band. Canadian operations within 120 km of the United States border were required to observe a number of restrictions on antenna height and power levels to coordinate use with non-amateur services in the United States.

In 2005, Industry Canada decided to reallocate 220–222 MHz to land mobile users, similar to the US, but unlike in the US, a provision was included to allow the amateur service, in exceptional circumstances, to use the band in disaster relief efforts on a secondary basis. In addition, the band 219–220 MHz was allocated to the amateur service on a secondary basis. Both of these reallocations went into effect January 2006.

== Band use ==

=== Canadian band plan ===

===Scope of operation in North America===
Today, the 1.25-meter band is used by many amateurs who have an interest in the VHF spectrum.

There are pockets of widespread use across the United States, mainly in New England and western states such as California and Arizona with more sporadic activity elsewhere. The number of repeaters on the 1.25-meter band has grown over the years to approximately 1,500 nationwide as of 2004.

The attention that band received in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to the reallocation of its bottom 2 MHz sparked renewed amateur interest. Many amateurs feared that lack of 1.25-meter activity would lead to reallocation of the remaining 3 MHz to other services. Today, new handheld and mobile equipment is being produced by amateur radio manufacturers, and it is estimated that more amateurs have 1.25-meter equipment now than at any point in the past.

=== Auxiliary stations ===
An auxiliary station, most often used for repeater control or link purposes or to remotely control another station, is limited in the United States to operation on frequencies above 144.5 MHz excluding 144.0–144.5 MHz, 145.8–146.0 MHz, 219–220 MHz, 222.00–222.15 MHz, 431–433 MHz, and 435–438 MHz. Operation of such control links in the crowded 2-meter band is problematic and on many frequencies in that band expressly prohibited, leaving 1.25-meter band frequencies as the lowest available for remote control of repeaters and unattended stations.

=== List of transceivers ===

Since the band is allocated mostly in ITU Region 2 (Somalia, in Region 1, being the only exception thus far), the major equipment manufacturers (Kenwood, Yaesu, and Icom) do not often offer transceiver models that cover the frequency range. (see ). This exacerbates the lack of usage of the 1.25-meter band, though manufacturers argue that what equipment they have produced has not sold well compared to other products.

In late seventies Yaesu introduced the FT-127 single band 220 MHz base station, and the FT-109RH portable radio. In 1987 they introduced the FT-33, single band 220 MHz version of the popular FT-23 portable radio.

In recent years, Kenwood and Yaesu have both included the 1.25-meter band in some of their multiband handheld transceivers. The Kenwood TH-F6A and TH-D74A; the Yaesu VX-6R, VX-7R and VX-8R (United States and Canada version) include coverage of the 1.25-meter band in addition to the more popular 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands. Wouxun now has the KG-UVD1P in a 2-meter / 1.25-meter model, legal for use in the United States. In the 1980s, ICOM offered the IC-37A—a 220 MHz, 25-watt FM transceiver that can still be obtained as used equipment from various sources such as eBay and private collectors. In 2013, the BaoFeng UV-82X, an inexpensive 2-meter / 1.25-meter handheld, became available. During 2021, Baofeng then introduced its latest, and cheapest, UV-5r III handheld transceiver, which now includes the 1.25 meter band as standard.

Several 1.25-meter base/mobile transceivers are available. Among these are the Alinco DR-235T, the Jetstream JT220M, BTech UV-2501-220, BTech UV-25X4 quadband, and the TYT TH-9000 monoband radio, which comes in a 1.25-meter model.

The Chinese company Wouxun offers a 2 m and 1.25 m dual-band HT, the KG-UVD1P. These have received FCC approval in the United States; but are awaiting approval by Industry Canada.

Elecraft offers an all-mode (CW, FM, SSB) transverter for the band compatible with its K2 and K3 transceivers.

<text>A split-phase or single-phase three-wire system is a type of single-phase electric power distribution. It is the alternating current (AC) equivalent of the original Edison Machine Works three-wire direct-current system. Its primary advantage is that, for a given capacity of a distribution system, it saves conductor material over a single-ended single-phase system.

The system is common in North America for residential and light commercial applications. Two AC lines are supplied to the premises that are out of phase by 180 degrees with each other (when both measured with respect to the neutral), along with a common neutral. The neutral conductor is connected to ground at the transformer center tap. Circuits for lighting and small appliance power outlets use circuits connected between one line and neutral. High-demand applications, such as ovens, are often powered using AC circuits—these are connected between the two AC lines. These loads are either hard-wired or use outlets which are deliberately non-interchangeable with outlets.

Other applications of a split-phase power system are used to reduce the electric shock hazard or to reduce electromagnetic noise.

==Connections==
A transformer supplying a three-wire distribution system has a single-phase input (primary) winding. The output (secondary) winding has a center tap connected to a grounded neutral. As shown in , either end to center has half the voltage of end-to-end. illustrates the phasor diagram of the output voltages for a split-phase transformer. Since the two phasors do not define a unique direction of rotation for a revolving magnetic field, a split single-phase is not a two-phase system.

In the United States and Canada, the practice originated with the DC distribution system developed by Thomas Edison. By connecting pairs of lamps or groups of lamps on the same circuit in series, and doubling the supply voltage, the size of conductors was reduced substantially. Connection of the junction point of each parallel branch of two series lamps to a common neutral, returned to the center tap of the supply voltage, stabilized the branch circuit voltages from changes when loads were switched on and off. The neutral conductor carried only the imbalance of current flowing from one group of loads to the other.

The line to neutral voltage is half the line-to-line voltage. Lighting and small appliances may be connected between a line wire and the neutral. Higher-power appliances, such as cooking equipment, space heating, water heaters, clothes dryers, air conditioners and electric vehicle charging equipment, are connected to the two line conductors. This means that, for the supply of the same amount of power, the current is halved. Smaller conductors may be used than would be needed if the appliances were designed to be supplied by the lower voltage.

If the load were guaranteed to be balanced (the same current drawn from each line), then the neutral conductor would not carry any current and the system would be equivalent to a single-ended system of twice the voltage with the line wires taking half the current. This would not need a neutral conductor at all, but would be impractical for varying loads; just connecting the groups in series would result in excessive voltage and brightness variation as lamps are switched on and off.

By connecting the two lamp groups to a neutral, intermediate in potential between the two live legs, any imbalance of the load will be supplied by a current in the neutral, giving substantially constant voltage across both groups. The total current carried in all three wires (including the neutral) will always be twice the supply current of the most heavily loaded half.

For short wiring runs limited by conductor current carrying capacity, this allows three half-sized conductors to be substituted for two full-sized ones, using 75% of the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.

Long wiring runs are limited by the permitted voltage drop limit in the conductors. Because the supply voltage is doubled, a balanced load can tolerate double the voltage drop, allowing quarter-sized conductors to be used; this uses 3/8 the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.

In practice, some intermediate value is chosen. For example, if the imbalance is limited to 25% of the total load (half of one half) rather than the absolute worst-case 50%, then conductors 3/8 of the single-phase size will guarantee the same maximum voltage drop, totalling 9/8 of one single-phase conductor, 56% of the copper of the two single-phase conductors.

==Balanced power==
In a so-called &quot;balanced power&quot; system, sometimes called &quot;technical power&quot;, an isolation transformer with a center tap is used to create a separate supply with conductors at balanced voltages with respect to ground. The purpose of a balanced power system is to minimize the noise coupled into sensitive equipment from the power supply.

Unlike a three-wire distribution system, the grounded neutral is not distributed to the loads; only line-to-line connections at are used. A balanced power system is used only for specialized distribution in audio and video production studios, sound and television broadcasting, and installations of sensitive scientific instruments.

The U.S. National Electrical Code provides rules for technical power installations. The systems are not to be used for general-purpose lighting or other equipment and may use special sockets to ensure that only approved equipment is connected to the system. Additionally, technical power systems pay special attention to the way the distribution system is grounded.

A risk of using a balanced power system in an installation that also uses &quot;conventional&quot; power in the same rooms is that a user may inadvertently interconnect the power systems together via an intermediate system of audio or video equipment, elements of which might be connected to different power systems. The chance of this happening may be reduced by appropriate labelling of the balanced power outlets and by the use of a type of power outlet socket for the balanced system that is physically different from that of the &quot;conventional&quot; power system to further differentiate them.

==Applications==
===Europe===
In Europe, three-phase 230/400 V is most commonly used. However, 130/225 V, three-wire, two-phase electric power discontinued systems called &quot;B1&quot; are used to run old installations in small groups of houses when only two of the three-phase high-voltage conductors are used. The phase shift in Europe is 120°, as is the case with three-phase current. That is why we calculate A three-phase final step-down transformer is then used. One house gets phases A and B, the next house gets phase B and C, the third house gets phase A and C. Some installations, such as farms (especially those never subsequently upgraded to three-phase) may be supplied with both phases to the same consumer. Whilst usually metered through two chosen phases of a typical three-phase meter, these two phases will only ever be used individually, not, as in the United States, to provide a higher voltage. Nonetheless they help with situations where a single supply cannot provide enough power for an installation.

In the United Kingdom, electric tools and portable lighting at larger construction and demolition sites are governed by , and where possible are recommended to be fed from a centre-tapped system with only 55 V between live conductors and the earth (so-called &quot;CTE&quot; or &quot;centre-tap earth&quot;, or 55–0–55). This reduced low-voltage system is used with 110 V equipment. No neutral conductor is distributed. In high-hazard locations, additional double-pole RCD protection may be used. The intention is to reduce the shock hazard that may exist when using electrical equipment at a wet or outdoor construction site, and eliminate the requirement for rapid automatic disconnection for prevention of shocks during faults. Portable transformers that transform single-phase 240 V to this 110 V split-phase system are a common piece of construction equipment. Generator sets used for construction sites are equipped to supply it directly. However, a large farm may be given a 230–0–230 (nominal) supply.

An incidental benefit is that the filaments of 110 V incandescent lamps used on such systems are thicker and thus mechanically more rugged than those of 240 V lamps.

===North America===
This three-wire single-phase system is common in North America for residential and light commercial applications. Circuit breaker panels typically have two live (hot) wires, and a neutral, connected at one point to the grounded center tap of a local transformer. Usually, one of the live wires is black and the other one red; the neutral wire is always white. Single-pole circuit breakers feed circuits from one of the buses within the panel, or two-pole circuit breakers feed circuits from both buses. circuits are the most common, and used to power and outlets, and most residential and light commercial direct-wired lighting circuits. circuits are used for high-demand applications, such as air conditioners, space heaters, electric stoves, electric clothes dryers, water heaters, and electric vehicle charge points. These use or outlets that will not accept plugs.

Wiring regulations govern the application of split-phase circuits so that the shared neutral can be protected from excess current. A neutral wire can be shared only by two circuits fed from opposite lines of the supply system, using circuit breakers connected by a bar so that both trip simultaneously ( NEC 210.4); this prevents from feeding across circuits.

==Railways==
In the electric power supply system of railways in Sweden split-phase electric power is also used on some railways. The center tap is grounded and one pole is fed to an overhead wire section, while the other wire is used for another section.

Split-phase distribution is used on Amtrak&#x27;s traction power system in the Northeast Corridor between New York and Boston. Two separate wires are run along the track, the contact wire for the locomotive and an electrically separate feeder wire. Each wire is fed with 25 kV with respect to ground, with 50 kV between them. Autotransformers along the track balance the loads between the contact and feeder wires, reducing resistive losses.

<text>Notacon (pronounced &quot;not-a-con&quot;) was an art and technology conference which took place annually in Cleveland, Ohio from 2003 to 2014. Notacon ceased operations in 2014. The name Notacon became a bacronym for Northern Ohio Technological Advancement Conference; however, use of this was mostly dropped after the first year. Notacon preceded the Ingenuity Festival by over a year in its vision for a cohesive blend of art and technology.

==History==


The conference was founded in 2003 by &quot;FTS Conventures&quot;, a small group of friends who wanted to strengthen and expand their community. The conference was also founded in part to fill the vacuum caused by the sudden ending of the Detroit, Michigan Rubi-Con event, though it has now achieved its own personality and prominence.

While many hacker conventions focus on the mechanics or political issues that surround such activities, Notacon&#x27;s focus was more on the underlying beauty or artistry of the technique of hacking, as well as other ways to apply a &quot;hacker mentality&quot; to the areas of art and music. Hence, in addition to topics of technology and computer security, many aspects of both the art and music world were represented. The concept of &quot;community through technology&quot; was one of the main focuses of Notacon, with the participants being dedicated to the advancement of computer technology.

==Notacon 3==
Notacon 3, took place April 7–9, 2006, with talks such as &quot;Make Your Own Linux&quot;, &quot;Blended Threat Management&quot;, &quot;How to Survive a Federal Investigation&quot;, &quot;The Great Failure of Wikipedia&quot;, &quot;Kryptos and the Da Vinci Code&quot;, &quot;HajjiNets: Running an ISP in a War Zone&quot; and &quot;Your Moment of Audio Zen: A History of Podcasts&quot;. A few of the talks were in direct association with the computer club Infonomicon, as several of their more high profile members spoke at the con, including droops, kn1ghtl0rd, p0trill023, irongeek, and ponyboy. Other notable speakers in 2006 included Jason Scott, Elonka Dunin, Drew Curtis, and Eric Meyer 

==Notacon 4==
Notacon 4, April 27–29, 2007, worked as an incubator for &quot;Blockparty&quot;, the largest running North American demoparty. This collaborative effort allowed the fledgling party to utilize the existing support structure of an established conference. 2007 also featured the first known presentation from a deceased community member, a multimedia update to a talk given at Rubi-con 5 called &quot;Secrets of the Phone Guy&quot;. This remixed presentation was titled &quot;Secrets of the Dead Phone Guy&quot; and was presented by &quot;The Friends of DanKaye&quot;. Also featured were presentations such as: &quot;DIY Green Energy&quot;, &quot;Why Building Hacker Spaces is Necessary and How to Do It&quot;, &quot;Online Communities and the Politics of DDoS&quot;, &quot;Notageek: Technology and Everyone Else&quot;, &quot;8 Dirty Secrets of the Security Industry&quot;, and &quot;Open Source Economic Development&quot;

== Notacon Radio ==
In 2005, 2006, and 2007, Notacon also included the Notacon Radio project, hosted by Jason Scott. Essentially an event-long Icecast (using Oddcast and Icecast2), Scott provided running audio commentary of the event, its attendees, and the world at large. The broadcast was also opened up to other contributors, including local tech-talkers &quot;Dial-a-Dork&quot;, who did a four-hour live show.

<doc id="1047965" wikidata="Q275933" url="?curid=1047965" title="Fiji national football team">
<text>The Fiji men&#x27;s national football team () is Fiji&#x27;s national men&#x27;s team and is controlled by the governing body of football in Fiji, the Fiji Football Association. The team plays most of their home games at the HFC Bank Stadium in Suva.

Fiji first participated in the FIFA World Cup qualification in 1982; since 1990, Fiji have attempted to qualify for each World Cup without success. Their best result was a final round appearance in 2010. The national team also represents Fiji at the OFC Nations Cup, having appeared in eight out of ten previous tournaments. Fiji&#x27;s best result is a third-place finish at the 1998 and 2008 editions. They have won the Melanesia Cup five times and competed in the Pacific Games from 1963 until 2015 when the competition became an under-23 tournament.

As in most countries in Oceania where football (or soccer) is not the most popular sport (such as Australia and New Zealand), Fiji&#x27;s most popular sport is rugby union. As of 2022, Fiji has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. In spite of this, the country&#x27;s youth football team has enjoyed recent success, qualifying for both the 2015 and 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cups and the 2016 Olympic football tournaments.

==History==

===Beginnings (1951–1973)===
Fiji&#x27;s first international football game was against a New Zealand side that was touring Oceania and had played four games against New Caledonia. The international, which took place on 7 October 1951, saw New Zealand getting the win 6-4. Jock Newall got a hat-trick for New Zealand. New Zealand returned the following year, with Fiji losing all three games, including a 9–0 drubbing in the second match.

After being absent from the international game for eleven years, the Fiji Football Association joined FIFA in 1963. That same year, the national team entered the first edition of the South Pacific Games, held in Fiji. In that tournament, the country appeared in its first gold medal match after defeating Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, but lost the match to New Caledonia 8–2. Marc-Kanyan Case scored four goals for the opposition and Fiji was relegated to silver.

After missing 1966, the team&#x27;s next tournament appearance was in the 1969 Games held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. They finished in fourth place out of six teams after losing to Papua New Guinea in the bronze medal playoff. Two years later, Fiji finished at the bottom of Group two with losses against New Caledonia and New Hebrides. They would, however, defeat the Cook Islands in the fifth place play-off.

===World Cup qualifying debut and Oceania upsets (1973–1991)===
As a member of the Oceania Football Confederation, Fiji played in the first edition of the OFC Nations Cup held in New Zealand in 1973. They did not win a match in the four games they played during the tournament. Competing at the 1975 South Pacific Games the national team, under coach Sashi Mahendra Singh, made the semi-finals of the competition where they lost to Tahiti. In the third-place playoff, they lost to the Solomon Islands by a goal.

After John Lal became the new coach for Fiji in 1977, his first match as coach was an unofficial game against Taiwan which ended in a two-all draw before taking on Australia who played Taiwan because of the soccer ban in the country. On 19 March 1977, they took on Australia at Buckhurst Park. Seven national players from Ba F.C. were unavailable due to a planned tour of New Zealand. After holding off the Australians for the first forty-five minutes, Jimmy Okete (who was making his debut) scored the only goal of the game. This was a shock to the locals since the team struggled in the two tours to Australia in 1961 and 1968 against the state teams.

Under the orders of new coach, Moti Musadilal, they played some pre-tournament friendlies against New Zealand conceding nine goals in the two games before competing at the 1979 South Pacific Games in Suva. After getting a nil all draw against Papua New Guinea, they scored their biggest win against Kiribati winning by twenty-four goals. After defeating Wallis and Futuna in the quarter-finals and Solomon Islands in the semis, they made it to their second Pacific Games final against Tahiti. In front of over twenty thousand people, Fiji came up short again with Erroll Bennett scoring a double to give Tahiti the gold medal.

Fiji&#x27;s next tournament was the 1980 OFC Nations Cup where they were grouped with New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Tahiti. After defeating the Solomon Islands in the opening game, they were expected to lose against New Zealand who were the favourites to win the group. On 27 February 1980, they became the first Fijian team to defeat a New Zealand team with Dewan Chand and Meli Vuilabasa both scoring two goals in the victory. Fiji did not make it to the final. They lost first to Tahiti 6–3, and then lost the third-place playoff to New Caledonia 2–1, in what was the last Oceania Cup for sixteen years.

The following year saw a new coach with former New Zealand coach Wally Hughes leading the team into their first World Cup qualifiers. After opening with a four-goal defeat against New Zealand, they drew with Indonesia nil-all, before defeating Chinese Taipei 2–1 to be in third place with three points. For Fiji that momentum was short-lived. They finished at the bottom of the group after conceding twenty-three goals in the final two games against Australia and New Zealand. Hughes resigned after the Australian game stating, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t wish on any coach what I have been through,&quot; suggesting that bribery was involved in the defeat to Australia.

After two years absence from international football, the national team, under Rudi Gutendorf, competed at the 1983 South Pacific Games in Samoa. After finishing top of the group that featured New Caledonia, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, they defeated Papua New Guinea 2–0 in the quarter-finals before knocking off New Caledonia in the semi-final. In the final, they lost to Tahiti by a single goal which was contested by the players who attacked the referee and linesmen. Another similar incident in a friendly against New Zealand happened the following year. This led to a one-year ban of international matches being held at Fiji.

Fiji&#x27;s next tournament was the 1988 Melanesia Cup held in the Solomon Islands. The national team won the final against the Solomon Islands 3–1 to claim their first title. Later in that year, they competed in the first round of the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification against Australia, with the motivation of five hundred Fijian dollars bonus for each player if they won. In front of six thousand people, they defeated Australia 1–0 with Ravuame Madigi scoring the goal to take the lead heading into the second leg. The second leg though saw Australia take out the match by a score of 5–1 in what media called the &quot;Battle of Newcastle&quot;. It included an all-in brawl in the last part of the match which saw Charlie Yankos get a broken nose.

After claiming the 1989 Melanesia Cup at home, in the following year they finished in third place behind Vanuatu and New Caledonia. The team headed to Tahiti for the 1991 South Pacific Games where they finished top of the group before defeating Vanuatu in the semi-finals. In the final, they took on the Solomon Islands where Radike Nawalu scored the opening goal of the game in the 29th minute to give Fiji the lead. The game went to penalties with Fiji winning the gold for the first time.

===Melanesia powerhouse (1991–2003)===
Fiji competed at the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification in Group B with Vanuatu and New Zealand. After losing to New Zealand in the opening game of qualifying at Christchurch, they headed off to Vanuatu to compete at the 1992 Melanesia Cup. They took the cup for the third time with the difference being one goal over New Caledonia. After a 3–0 win over Vanuatu in Suva, they tied with New Zealand at the same ground. In the final game of the group, they defeated Vanuatu in Port Vila by the same scoreline. That game was a dead rubber as they finished behind New Zealand and were eliminated from contention.

After not qualifying for the 1996 OFC Nations Cup having finished second at the 1994 Melanesia Cup, at the 1995 South Pacific Games in Tahiti Fiji won the bronze medal by defeating Vanuatu in the bronze medal playoff.

Attempting to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Fiji got a bye into the second round of qualifying where they were paired with New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. The top team qualified for the third round. The nation finished in second place with losses to New Zealand both at home (1–0) and away (5–0) being the critical factors in their elimination. Fiji&#x27;s next tournament was the 1998 OFC Nations Cup after they qualified by taking out the 1998 Melanesia Cup held in Vanuatu. The only blemish being a one–all draw against the Solomon Islands.

After losing to the hosts (Australia) 3–0 in their first game, they defeated the Cook Islands 3–1 to secure a semi-final spot where they fell to New Zealand by a single goal. This put them into the third-place playoff where they defeated Tahiti for their best result to date at the OFC Nations Cup with a third-place. Esala Masi was the top goalscorer for the tournament with three goals. Fiji qualified for the following edition of the Nations Cup after winning the title at the 2000 Melanesia Cup in Fiji. But later that year, Fiji withdrew because of political unrest in the country, which led to the 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état.

Fiji&#x27;s qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup started at Coffs Harbour when they were grouped with American Samoa, Australia, Samoa and Tonga in Group one. In the opening game of the group, they defeated American Samoa 13–0 to record their biggest win in a FIFA match. Shailemdra Lal scored five goals; Esala Masi scored four. After defeating Samoa 6–1, they lost to Australia 2–0 to finish in second place and were eliminated from contention. Only the top team from the group qualified through to the second round. They met Australia again at the 2002 OFC Nations Cup in New Zealand. They finished in third place in the group after only winning against New Caledonia followed by an 8–0 loss against Australia. This eliminated Fiji from the semi-finals and saw the sack of Billy Singh ending a seven-year reign in his third stint as coach of the national team.

Fiji claimed the 2003 South Pacific Games gold medal at home. The squad, which consisted mostly of young players, was able to go unbeaten throughout the tournament defeating New Caledonia in the gold medal match. Esala Masi was Fiji&#x27;s top scorer for Fiji with twelve goals which included the seven in the 12–0 win over Kiribati in the group stage.

===Recent times (2004–)===
Fiji&#x27;s qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup started in Samoa. They finished in second place in the qualifying group which featured Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and American Samoa. Their only loss was against Vanuatu on the final match-day. This meant that Fiji qualified through to the 2004 OFC Nations Cup. After drawing with Tahiti and getting a win over Vanuatu, their World Cup chance ended when Fiji lost the next three matches and were eliminated at the second stage of qualifying.

Fiji&#x27;s next tournament was the 2007 South Pacific Games in Samoa, which was also the first round of qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. After getting safely through the group, which included Tuvalu, Tahiti, Cook Islands and New Caledonia, they took on Vanuatu for a spot in the semi-finals to qualify for the next round. In the semi-finals, they defeated Vanuatu to advance to the second round of qualifying with a three-goal victory, confirming their spot in the gold medal match. They lost by a single goal to New Caledonia, however, to finish runner-up for the fourth time.

The second round of qualifying got off to a rocky start. Goalkeeper, Simione Tamanisau was refused entry because his father had been linked to the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état. The match was moved to the end of the qualifying period with Fiji winning 2–0. During that reschedule, the national team played the rest of their World Cup games. The team finished in third place in the group after getting only one point in their first three games—a three-all draw against New Caledonia. This was a key factor as the later 4–0 loss to the same team ended their hopes for qualifying to the next stage.

Under the guidance of Gurjit Singh, the team competed at the 2011 Pacific Games in New Caledonia. In the group stage, the team qualified for the semi-finals with a game to spare as they would go through with a clean sweep of wins. In the semi-finals, they took the lead against the Solomon Islands in the sixty-ninth minute of play with a goal by Maciu Dunadamu. But goals from Joses Nawo and Henry Fa&#x27;arodo, however, gave the Solomon Islands the win and a spot in the gold medal match. Fiji finished in fourth place losing to Tahiti in the bronze medal match 2–1.

Juan Carlos Buzzetti returned to Fiji&#x27;s top job as he led the team to the 2012 OFC Nations Cup. This was also the second part of qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Competing in Group B, they lost the opening game to New Zealand. The only goalscorer of the match was Kiwi player Tommy Smith in the eleventh minute. After a nil-all draw against the Solomon Islands, they got their only goal of the tournament with Maciu Dunadamu opening the scoring against Papua New Guinea in the fifteenth minute. But a late goal from Kema Jack ended the tournament for Fiji with a draw and knocked them out in the group stage.

After not competing in a senior international for three years, the national team had two friendlies against A-League side Wellington Phoenix before entering their under-23 squad for the 2015 Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea. This was also a qualifier for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil. After losing the opening game, they got a draw in the second match with Roy Krishna and Ilimotama Jese each scoring a goal for Fiji. More friendlies took place before the national team headed to Papua New Guinea for the 2016 OFC Nations Cup. This was also the second round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup. With a squad that only had three outside of the National League, Fiji lost the opening game against New Zealand with Krishna getting the only goal in the 3–1 loss. After defeating the Solomon Islands in their second game with a Krishna goal, they needed to at least draw Vanuatu in the final group game to have a chance at qualifying to the semis. After almost getting the early lead from Krishna, Fiji fell behind by two goals from Dominique Fred and Fenedy Masauvakalo giving Vanuatu the lead. The second half saw Fiji tie the match at two-all as goals from Samuela Kautoga and Krishna gave the team hope of qualifying. But Fiji was eliminated from the competition as a penalty in the 75th minute by Brian Kaltack gave Vanuatu a spot in the semis by goal difference.

For finishing third place, they qualified through to the third round of qualifying. Fiji was drawn to face New Zealand and New Caledonia in Group A. Before the first game against New Zealand, Frank Farina was replaced by Christophe Gamel in the top job with Gamel stating, &quot;We respect our opponents and we know that they are strong&quot; in his first press conference as manager. Fiji only got a single point from their four games. That point was against New Caledonia at Lautoka with the game ending in a two–all draw.

===Kit sponsorship===
=== Home stadium ===
The first soccer international held in Fiji was held at Albert Park, when New Zealand took on the hosts in 1951. The stadium, the main centre in Fiji during the early 20th century, was also the home of cricket and of the country&#x27;s first Rugby union test match in 1926.

In modern times, most games hosted by Fiji are held at the HFC Bank Stadium, which was built in 1951 and has been renovated twice which can hold a capacity of 15,000. The first renovation was in 1978 for the 1979 South Pacific Games held in Suva. A second renovation took place in 2012 sponsored by ANZ Fiji at a cost 17.5 million Fijian dollars in exchange for the stadium&#x27;s naming rights. The football team has also played games at Lautoka, Ba, Nausori and Labasa.
