<text>Michael Field was a pseudonym used for the poetry and verse drama of the English authors Katherine Harris Bradley (27 October 1846 – 26 September 1914) and her niece and ward Edith Emma Cooper (12 January 1862 – 13 December 1913). As Field, they wrote around 40 works together, and a long journal &quot;Works and Days&quot;. Their intention was to keep the pen-name secret, but it became public knowledge, not long after they had confided in their friend Robert Browning.

==Biographies==
Katherine Bradley was born on 27 October 1846 in Birmingham, England, the daughter of Charles Bradley, a tobacco manufacturer, and Emma (née Harris). Her grandfather, also Charles Bradley, was a prominent follower and financial backer of prophetess Joanna Southcott and her self-styled successor John &quot;Zion&quot; Ward. She attended lectures at the Collège de France in 1868, and in 1874 she attended a course at Newnham College, Cambridge specially designed for women; however, she did not receive a degree for it.

Bradley&#x27;s elder sister, Emma, married James Robert Cooper in 1860 and went to live in Kenilworth, where their daughter, Edith Emma Cooper, was born on 12 January 1862. Emma Cooper became an invalid for life after the birth of her second daughter, Amy, and Katharine Bradley, being her sister, stepped in to become the legal guardian of her niece Edith Cooper.

Bradley was for a time involved with Ruskin&#x27;s utopian project. She published first under the pseudonym Arran Leigh, a nod to Elizabeth Barrett. Cooper adopted the name Isla Leigh for their first joint publication, &quot;Bellerophôn&quot;.

In the late 1870s, when Cooper was at University College, Bristol, they agreed to live together and were, over the next 40 years, lesbian lovers and co-authors. Their first joint publication as Michael Field was &quot;Callirhöe and Fair Rosamund&quot; in 1884. The Athenaeum noted that &#x27;the famous Faun song in &#x27;Callirrhoé,&#x27; which has found its way into many anthologies, the Fairy songs in &#x27;Fair Rosamund,&#x27; and the whole of the poignant drama of &#x27;The Father&#x27;s Tragedy&#x27; were the work of the younger writer while still a girl.&#x27;

Bradley and Cooper were Aestheticists, strongly influenced by the thoughts of Walter Pater. They developed a large circle of literary friends and contacts; in particular, painters and life partners Charles Ricketts and Charles Shannon, near whom they settled in Richmond, London. Robert Browning was a close friend of theirs — if also the source of their leaked identity — as well as Rudyard Kipling. They also knew and admired Oscar Wilde, whose death they bitterly mourned. 

While Bradley and Cooper were always well connected and financially independent, their early critical success was not sustained. (This is often attributed to the joint identity of Field becoming known). They knew many of the aesthetic movement of the 1890s, including Walter Pater, Vernon Lee, J. A. Symonds and also Bernard Berenson. William Rothenstein was a friend. In 1899, the death of Cooper&#x27;s father enabled them to buy their own house as evidence of their &quot;close marriage&quot; although Cooper saw her father&#x27;s death as retribution for their lifestyle. She later led the way in establishing the couple as active Catholics.

Bradley and Cooper wrote a number of passionate love poems to each other, and their name, Michael Field, was their way of declaring their inseparable oneness. Friends referred to them as the Fields, the Michaels, or the Michael Fields while they themselves had a range of pet names for each other. They also were passionately devoted to their pets, particularly their dog, Whym Chow, for whom they wrote a book of elegiac poems entitled &quot;Whym Chow: Flame of Love&quot;. Their joint journal starts with an account of Bradley&#x27;s passion for Alfred Gérente, an artist in stained glass and brother of Henri Gérente, who was of an English background but worked mostly in France. It goes on to document Michael Field as a figure amongst &#x27;his&#x27; literary counterparts and their lives together. When Whym Chow died in 1906, the emotional pattern of the relationship was disturbed; both women became Roman Catholic converts in 1907. Their religious inclinations are reflected in their later works while their earlier writing was influenced by classical and Renaissance culture in its pagan aspects, particularly Sappho as understood by the late Victorians and perhaps Walter Savage Landor.

Bradley found that she had breast cancer in June 1913 and told only her confessor, Vincent McNabb; she never told Cooper, who had been diagnosed with cancer in 1911. Cooper died 13 December 1913 at their home, The Paragon, Richmond. Bradley died 26 September 1914, having moved to a cottage near McNabb at Hawkesyard Priory, Rugeley. They are buried together in the cemetery of St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church in Mortlake. Bradley left most of her property to Charles Ricketts with a bequest of letters to the poet Frederick Gurney Salter and jewels and manuscripts to the University of Cambridge.

==Legacy==

In 1923, saddened at the lack of a memorial for Bradley and Cooper, Charles Ricketts designed one for them of black stone, for which John Gray wrote the epitaph: &#x27;United in blood, united in Christ&#x27;. However, this tombstone at St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake cracked irreparably in 1926, the year in which it was installed, and is now lost.

Their extensive diaries are stored in the British Library, and have been digitized and made available by the Victorian Lives and Letters Consortium. Carolyn Dever argues that the diaries contain many novelistic qualities — at least up until the time of Whym Chow&#x27;s death.

A much-edited selection from the journals, which consists of two dozen annual volumes in ledgers with aspects of scrapbooks combined with a self-conscious literary style of composition, was prepared by T. Sturge Moore, a friend through his mother Marie.

==Reception==

A review of their poems in 1908 noted that &quot;One of the London weeklies, announcing the new volume, comments on the strange anomaly that a poet of &#x27;Michael Field’s&#x27; distinction should have had such slight recognition in this country.&quot; A writer in the &quot;Academy&quot; was quoted as saying that &quot;he is perhaps the greatest of our living lyric poets who are actually writing at this time, and it is claimed that those who are acquainted with the poet&#x27;s work must agree with this appreciation.&quot; &quot;Without entering into the question of comparative merit,&quot; said the &quot;Yorkshire Observer,&quot; &quot;it may be readily admitted that the poems have had a genuine note of distinction&quot;. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; noted that &quot;Seven years ago both poets were received into the Roman Church, and their definitely Catholic work is represented by two volumes of devotional verse: &#x27;Poems of Adoration,&#x27; by the younger, and &#x27;Mystic Trees,&#x27; by the elder writer.&quot;

<text>Aero AT Sp.z o.o. is a Polish light aircraft manufacturer founded by Tomasz Antoniewski in Warsaw in 1994. It is unrelated to the Czech Aero company.

The company is organized as a Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością (Sp.z o.o.), a Polish private limited company.

The company was founded to develop and market a two-seat aircraft specifically for the flight training and touring market. The result of this venture was the Aero AT-3, type certified by European Aviation Safety Agency in May 1999 under the EASA CS-VLA rules, only the sixth aircraft type to receive this certification. The first five production aircraft were delivered to customers in 2002. A version for the light-sport aircraft market was accepted by the Federal Aviation Administration and marketed as the Gobosh 700 in the United States.

<text>The Conmhaícne Mara or Conmaicne Mara (the Conmaicne of the sea) were an early people of Ireland. Their tuath was located in the extreme west of County Galway, Ireland, giving their name to Connemara, an anglicised form of Conmhaicne Mara.

==Origin==
The Conmhaícne or Conmaicne were a people of early Ireland, perhaps related to the Laigin, who dispersed to various parts of Ireland. They settled in Connacht and Longford, giving their name to several Conmaicne territories. Other branches of the Conmaicne located in County Galway included the Conmaícne Dúna Móir (Conmaicne of Dunmore) and the Conmhaícne Cúile Toland (Conmaicne of Cuile-Toland).

==Territory==

Conmhaícne Mara comprised all of the barony of Ballynahinch and the civil parish of Inishbofin, which is in the barony of Murrisk. The territory contains the five civil parishes of Ballynakill/Baile na Cille, Ballindoon, Moyrus/Maigh Iorras, Omey/Iomaidh Fheicín and Inishbofin/Inis Bó Fine. The territory contains the five Catholic parishes of &quot;An Clochán&quot; (Clifden, Omey &amp; Ballindoon), &quot;Iorras Ainbhtheach&quot; (Carna), &quot;Cloch na Rón&quot;/(Roundstone), &quot;Baile na Cille&quot; (Ballynakill) and &quot;Inis Bó Fine&quot;/(*Inishbofin (County Galway)).

The area of County Galway in which Connemara lies is known as Iar Connacht i.e. the portion of County Galway west of Lough Corrib and a small piece of County Mayo. The parish of Kilconickny, which means &quot;church of the Conmaicne&quot;is located west of the town of Loughrea.

==History==
The chiefs of the Conmaicne Mara were the O’Kealys, and their cadets were the MacConneelys, O’Devaneys, and O’Clohertys, with the O’Falons [Folan] as their hereditary brehons. The O’Kealys relocated to Ui Oirbsen, but they were to find themselves imposed upon again after just a few decades. The MacConneelys stayed in their home at Ballyconneely Peninsula, but soon found themselves neighbors of the O’Flahertys.

A court inquisition in 1607 includes the following as leading chiefs of name in the barony of Ballynahinch: O’Flaherty of Bunowen, MacConroy, MacConnor, MacDonough, O’Duan, O’Lee, and MacConneely. MacConnor and MacDonough, are chiefs of branches that separated from the O’Flahertys, while the two after that, O’Duan and O’Lee, headed old followers of that family. The MacConneelys were the eldest cadets of the O’Kealys of Conmaicne Mara.

<text>Eumenes II Soter (; ; ruled 197–159 BC) was a ruler of Pergamon, and a son of Attalus I Soter and queen Apollonis and a member of the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon.

==Biography==
The eldest son of king Attalus I and queen Apollonis, Eumenes was presumably born prior to 220 BC and was the eldest of four sons to Attalus I. Eumenes followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps upon becoming king and collaborated with the Romans to oppose first Macedonian, then Seleucid expansion towards the Aegean, leading to the defeat of Antiochus the Great at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC.

He had refused to marry a daughter of Antiochus III upon noticing that he was about to engage in a war against the Romans.
He then had married Stratonice of Pergamon, daughter of Ariarathes IV (King of Cappadocia) and his wife Antiochis, and their son was named Attalus III.

===Expansion of the kingdom===

Eumenes had followed his father&#x27;s footsteps and aided the Romans whenever he could, firstly in the Syrian War, where he both informed them by sending his brother Attalus II and sided with the Romans, successfully aiding Rome in defeating Antiochus III in the Battle of Magnesia. He then aided the Romans in the War against Nabis where he aided both the Aetolian and Achaean leagues to defeat the Spartan tyrant Nabis, and lastly in the Third Macedonian War where he aided the Romans in defeating the Macedonian and Thracian army in the Battle of Pydna against Perseus of Macedon. He was then at war with the Bithynian king Prusias I in 183 BC, although being defeated, he received Roman support which ended in his victory.

Following the Peace of Apamea in 188 BC, he received the regions of Phrygia, Lydia, Pisidia, Pamphylia, and parts of Lycia from his Roman allies. By dividing Asia Minor between their allies Rhodes and Pergamon, the Romans made sure that neither state would be able to become too powerful in the region.

===Falling out of favour with the Romans===
Eumenes later fell out of favour with the Romans after they suspected him of conspiring with Perseus of Macedon. In order to avert suspicion, he sent his congratulations to Rome by his brother Attalus II after the defeat of Perseus. Attalus was received courteously, and in 167 BC the Romans made an abortive attempt to install Attalus on the Pergamene throne. Eumenes in alarm set out to visit Rome in person to plead his case, but on his arrival at Brundusium (Brindisi) was ordered to leave Italy at once. In the event, the ties of kinship proved strong, and Eumenes remained as ruler. He also warred with Pharnaces I, who attempted to enlist the aid of the Seleucids, under Seleucus IV but due to the peace of Apamea, denied siding with him. Later on, in around 179 BC, after suffering losses, Pharnaces sued for peace.

When Eumenes&#x27; health began to weaken, his brother Attalus II ascended to the throne as a co-ruler in 160 BC. Since Eumenes&#x27; and Stratonice&#x27;s son was still a minor, the throne was assumed by Attalus, who also married Stratonice in 158 BC upon becoming king.

==Legacy==

Eumenes II was a shrewd ruler and politician, who raised his state to a powerful monarchy. During his reign Pergamum became a flourishing city, where men of learning were always welcome, among them Crates of Mallus, the founder of the Pergamene school of criticism. Eumenes adorned the city with splendid buildings, amongst them the great altar with the frieze representing the Battle of the Giants. His great achievement was the expansion of the Library at Pergamon, one of the great libraries of the Ancient World and the place traditionally associated with the creation of parchment, although it had existed for centuries. He also built a stoa on the Athenian acropolis.

<text>Garfield Dunlop is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2015 who represented the riding of Simcoe North. He resigned from the legislature in 2015 in order to provide a vacancy so that former PC leader Patrick Brown could seek a seat in the legislature.

==Background==
Dunlop was educated at the University of Waterloo. In 1971, he joined his family business, Glen Dunlop Plumbing, Heating and Supplies.

==Politics==
In 1980, Dunlop was elected a councillor in the village of Coldwater, Ontario. He served as reeve of the village from 1982 to 1994, and as deputy mayor of the township of Severn from 1994 to 1999. In 1998, he was named warden of Simcoe County.

Dunlop was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1999 provincial election. He won the Progressive Conservative nomination in Simcoe North following the resignation amid scandal of sitting MPP Al McLean. Dunlop defeated his Liberal opponent George MacDonald, in 1999, by about 7,000 votes. He was re-elected in four times from 2003 to 2014. In 2014 his vote count dropped dramatically, while his opponents made significant gains, in what has been considered a safe riding for Progressive Conservative candidates.

Dunlop was appointed deputy government whip after his election, but was not given a cabinet position in the governments of Mike Harris or Ernie Eves. He was one of only 24 Tories re-elected in the 2003 election, defeating Liberal Paul Sloan by 3680 votes.

Dunlop is socially conservative. While campaigning in 2003, he handed out literature against same-sex marriage, which he referred to as a sin. Dunlop is also known to support private prisons.

As an Opposition member, Dunlop served as chief opposition whip from 2003 to 2005 and was Progressive Conservative critic for community safety and correctional services from 2003 to 2011 and was chair of the Standing Committee on Estimates from 2009 to 2011. From 2011 to 2014 he was critic for Training and Apprenticeship and from 2014 until 2015 he served as critic for Education as well as for Training, Colleges and Universities.

During the 2015 Progressive Conservative leadership campaign, Dunlop supported Lisa MacLeod and criticized eventual winner Patrick Brown, at the time federal Member of Parliament for Barrie without a seat in the Ontario legislature, for being &quot;a federal member who’s made no headway whatsoever in the Harper government in the eight or nine years he’s been there.&quot; Dunlop added: &quot;How could I possibly think he could come to Ontario and do a good job when he couldn’t even make cabinet in Ottawa?&quot;

Nevertheless, on July 22, 2015 Dunlop announced he would step aside and allow Brown to run in the riding so that he could enter the legislature. Dunlop&#x27;s resignation took effect August 1, 2015.

His daughter, Jill Dunlop, was elected to represent Simcoe North in the 2018 provincial election.

<doc id="1061036" wikidata="Q650558" url="?curid=1061036" title="John the Exarch">
<text>John the Exarch (also transcribed Joan Ekzarh; ) was a medieval Bulgarian scholar, writer and translator, one of the most important men of letters working at the Preslav Literary School at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century. He was active during the reign of Boris I () and his son Simeon I (). His most famous work is the compilation &quot;Shestodnev&quot; (Шестоднев – Hexameron) that consists of both translations of earlier Byzantine authors and original writings. The Russian Orthodox Church canonized him and his memory is honoured on the . In a manuscript of the Gospels, held in the National Library of Serbia, an alternative date is given, namely — .

== Life ==

Evidence about his life is scarce but his literary legacy suggests an excellent knowledge of Greek language. It is therefore assumed that John the Exarch received his education in the Byzantine Empire. Some historians assume that his sobriquet &quot;the Exarch&quot; means that he was the Archbishop of Bulgaria. Others suggest that this was not an bishopric rank. There are also theories that identify John the Exarch with Chernorizets Hrabar or with John of Rila.

== Literary activities ==
John the Exarch&#x27;s literary work includes a number of translations of medieval Byzantine authors, the most important of which is the translation, around 895, of &quot;On Orthodox Christianity&quot; by the Byzantine theologian John of Damascus. He is also the author of several original works and compilations, the most important whereof is the compilation &quot;Шестоднев&quot; (&quot;Shestodnev&quot;). The compilation includes parts of the works of several Byzantine authors, most notably Basil the Great, as well as original parts which give valuable first-hand evidence about the Bulgarian Empire under Simeon I (). John the Exarch describes the royal palace and the Bulgarian ruler that includes information about his attire, the boyars, the social stratification of the Bulgarian society and like matters.

<text>Maria Konopnicka (; ; 23 May 1842 – 8 October 1910) was a Polish poet, novelist, children&#x27;s writer, translator, journalist, critic, and activist for women&#x27;s rights and for Polish independence. She used pseudonyms, including &quot;Jan Sawa&quot;. She was one of the most important poets of Poland&#x27;s Positivist period.

==Life==
Konopnicka was born in Suwałki on 23 May 1842. Her father, Józef Wasiłowski, was a lawyer. She was home-schooled and spent a year (1855–56) at a convent &quot;pension&quot; of the Sisters of Eucharistic Adoration in Warsaw (&quot;Zespół klasztorny sakramentek w Warszawie&quot;).

She made her debut as a writer in 1870 with the poem, &quot;W zimowy poranek&quot; (&quot;On a Winter&#x27;s Morn&quot;). She gained popularity after the 1876 publication of her poem, &quot;W górach&quot; (&quot;In the Mountains&quot;), which was praised by future Nobel laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz.
In 1862 she married Jarosław Konopnicki. They had six children. The marriage was not a happy one, as her husband disapproved of her writing career. In a letter to a friend, she described herself as &quot;having no family&quot; and as being &quot;a bird locked in a cage&quot;. Eventually in 1878, in an unofficial separation, she left her husband and moved to Warsaw to pursue writing. She took her children with her. She would often travel in Europe; her first major trip was to Italy in 1883. She spent the years 1890–1903 living abroad in Europe.Her life has been described as &quot;turbulent&quot;, including extramarital romances, deaths, and mental illnesses in the family. She was a friend of a Polish woman poet of the Positivist period, Eliza Orzeszkowa, and of the painter and activist Maria Dulębianka.
In addition to being an active writer, she was also a social activist, organizing and participating in protests against the repression of ethnic (primarily Polish) and religious minorities in Prussia. She was also involved in women&#x27;s-rights activism.

Her literary work in the 1880s gained wide recognition in Poland. In 1884 she began writing children&#x27;s literature, and in 1888 she debuted as an adult-prose writer with 
&quot;Cztery nowele&quot; (Four Short Stories). Due to the growing popularity of her writings, in 1902 a number of Polish activists decided to reward her by buying her a manor house. It was purchased with funds collected by a number of organizations and activists. As Poland was not an independent country at the time, and as her writings were politically uncongenial to the Prussian and Russian authorities, a location was chosen in the more tolerant Austrian partition of pre-Partition Poland. In 1903 she received a manor in Żarnowiec, where she arrived on 8 September. She would spend most springs and summers there, but she would still travel about Europe in fall and winter.
She died in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) on 8 October 1910. She was buried there in the Łyczakowski Cemetery. As per her wish Dulębianka was laid to rest next to her.

== Work ==

Konopnicka wrote prose (primarily short stories) as well as poems. One of her most characteristic styles were poems stylized as folk songs. She would try her hand at many genres of literature, such as reportage sketches, narrative memoirs, psychological portrait studies and others.

A common theme in her works was the oppression and poverty of the peasantry, workers, and Polish Jews. Due to her sympathy for Jewish people, she was considered a philosemite. Her works were also highly patriotic and nationalistic.

One of her best known works is the long epic in six cantos, &quot;Mister Balcer in Brazil&quot; (&quot;Pan Balcer w Brazylii&quot;, 1910), on the Polish emigrants in Brazil. Another one was &quot;Rota&quot; (&quot;Oath&quot;, 1908) which set to the music by Feliks Nowowiejski two years later became an unofficial anthem of Poland, particularly in the territories of the Prussian Partition. This patriotic poem was strongly critical of the Germanization policies and thus described as anti-German.Her most famous children&#x27;s literature work is the 1896 &quot;O krasonoludkach i sierotce Marysi&quot; (&quot;Little Orphan Mary and the Gnomes&quot;). Her children literature works were well received, as compared to many other works of the period.

Maria Konopnicka also composed a poem about the execution of the Irish patriot, Robert Emmet. Emmet was executed by the British authorities in Dublin in 1803, but Konopnicka published her poem on the topic in 1908.

She was also a translator. Her translated works include Ada Negri&#x27;s &quot;Fatalita&quot; and &quot;Tempeste&quot;, published in Poland in 1901.

<doc id="1061067" wikidata="Q1146725" url="?curid=1061067" title="Constantine of Preslav">
<text>Constantine of Preslav () was a medieval Bulgarian scholar, writer and translator, one of the most important men of letters working at the Preslav Literary School at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century. Biographical evidence about his life is scarce but he is believed to have been a disciple of Saint Methodius. After the saint&#x27;s death in 885, Constantine was jailed by the Germanic clergy in Great Moravia and sold as slave in Venice. He escaped to Constantinople, moving to Bulgaria around 886 and working at the Preslav Literary School.

He was one of the most prolific and important writers in Old Bulgarian (the Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). His most significant literary work was &quot;Учително евангелие&quot; (&quot;The Didactic Gospel&quot;), usually dated to the first years of the reign of Bulgarian tsar Simeon I, 893 – 894. The work represents a compilation of lectures about a number of church holidays and is the first systematic work treating sermons in Slavic literature. The compilation also features the poetic preface &quot;Азбучна молитва&quot; (&quot;Alphabet Prayer&quot;), the first original poetry in Old Church Slavonic.

In 894 Constantine of Preslav wrote the historical work &quot;Историкии&quot; (&quot;Histories&quot;), the first historical chronicle in Slavic literature. In 906, by commission from Simeon I, the author translated &quot;Четири слова против арианите&quot; (&quot;Four Epistles against the Arians&quot;) by Saint Athanasius of Alexandria, as a response to the beginning of the spread of heresies in medieval Bulgaria. Constantine is also the alleged author of &quot;Служба на Методия&quot; (&quot;Service for Methodius&quot;), in which he relates the struggle of Saint Methodius for the recognition of Old Church Slavonic, as well as of &quot;Проглас към евангелието&quot; (&quot;Proclamation of the Holy Gospels&quot;) in which he rejects and admonishes the admiration of the foreign language (mean. Greek) and champions Old Bulgarian for the development and elevation of Bulgarian culture.

None of the original works of Constantine of Preslav has survived the burning of Preslav by Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimisces in 972 and the period of Ottoman rule (1396 – 1878). All of his works are known from copies, the earliest of which date back to the 12th and the 13th century.

<doc id="1061068" wikidata="Q828125" url="?curid=1061068" title="Tokaj wine region">
<text>Tokaj wine region ( ) or Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region (short &quot;Tokaj-Hegyalja&quot; or &quot;Hegyalja&quot;) is a historical wine region located in northeastern Hungary and southeastern Slovakia. It is also one of the seven larger wine regions of Hungary (). &quot;Hegyalja&quot; means &quot;foothills&quot; in Hungarian, and this was the original name of the region.

The region consists of 28 named villages and 11,149 hectares of classified vineyards, of which an estimated 5,500 are currently planted. Tokaj is particularly famous as the origin of Tokaji aszú wine, the world&#x27;s oldest botrytized wine. Because of its testimony to a long and unique tradition of viticulture and its cultural importance as a wine-making region, Tokaj was declared a World Heritage Site in 2002 under the name Tokaj Wine Region Historic Cultural Landscape. 

Due to the Treaty of Trianon, a smaller part of the historical wine region now belongs to Slovakia.

== Characteristics ==
Some of the characteristics which make the Tokaj wine region unique are:

*Soil and microclimate: The Tokaj terroir consists of clay or loess soil on volcanic subsoil. The microclimate is determined by the sunny, south-facing slopes and the proximity of the Tisza and Bodrog rivers, and is conducive to the proliferation of &quot;Botrytis&quot; (noble rot) and the subsequent desiccation of the grapes.
*Indigenous grape varieties: Furmint and Hárslevelű have been cultivated in the region for centuries and, together with Yellow Muscat (Hungarian: &quot;Sárgamuskotály&quot;), Kabar, Kövérszőlő and Zéta, are the only grape varieties officially permitted for use in the region.
*Cellars: A vast system of cellars was carved out of solid rock between 1400 and 1600 AD. They provide a constant temperature of around 10-12 °C. The cellars are covered with a characteristic mold, which feeds off the alcohol evaporated during aging and keeps the humidity in the range of 85-90%, which is ideal for the aging of Tokaji wines.
*Appellation system: A royal decree in 1737 or 1757 established a closed production district in Tokaj, supposedly the world&#x27;s earliest system of wine appellation (though the claim is disputed by Chianti, whose territory was defined in 1716). Vineyard classification began in 1730 and was completed by the national censuses of 1765 and 1772.

== History ==
Historical records show that vineyards had been established in Tokaj as early as the 12th century, but there is evidence for the earlier introduction of wine production to the region.

A number of experts claim that viticulture could have started in the Tokaj region as early as in the Celtic times, that is BC. A petrified grape leaf found in Erdőbénye and dating from the late 3rd century AD, points to the existence of viticulture in Roman times. Slavs arrived in the region in the late 5th/early 6th century. One possible origin for the name &quot;Tokaj&quot; is that it is derived from the Slavic word &quot;Stokaj&quot;, meaning approximately confluence (i.e. confluence of the rivers Bodrog and Tisza). The Slovaks claim that Slavs continued previous viticulture in the region. Magyar settlers arrived in Tokaj from the end of the 9th Century and there is an alternative theory that viticulture was introduced to the region from the east, possibly by the Kabar tribe. The Magyars themselves seem to have had an ancient tradition of wine-making (see: Origins of Hungarian wine-making). Another possible origin for the name &quot;Tokaj&quot; is that it comes from an Armenian word meaning &quot;grape&quot;.

&quot;Latin&quot; people were first invited to settle in Tokaj by Hungarian King Béla III (1172–1196) and then by Béla IV (1235–1270). These immigrants were probably Walloons from northern France, although some researchers claim that they were Italians. Slavic peoples (Slovaks and Rusyns) are also documented as being involved in Tokaj viticulture by the 12th century. However, the rise of Tokaj as a major wine region can be dated to the early 16th Century.

Around 1620 the Emperor imported a Walloon-French wine-farmer Duvont, who later invented what would be known as the &quot;king of wines&quot;-method in the Tokaji-district.

In honour of Mr. Duvont&#x27;s exceptional skills, the Emperor ennobled this farmer, and gave him one of his many villages (Kiralyfalva), now Königsdorf in Austria. The emperor then named the family Királyfalvy.

Tokaji wine became an increasingly important commodity for the region from the 17th century, its export being a major source of income for the ruling princes of Transylvania to which the Tokaj region belonged at the time. Indeed, revenues from the increasingly renowned Tokaji Aszú wine helped to pay for the wars of independence fought against Austrian Habsburg rule. The repute of Tokaji wine was enhanced when in 1703, Francis II Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania, gave King Louis XIV of France a gift of numerous bottles of wine from his Tokaj estate. Tokaji wine was then served at the Versailles Court, where it became known under the name of Tokay. Delighted with the precious beverage, Louis XIV declared it &quot;Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum&quot; (&quot;Wine of Kings, King of Wines&quot;).

In the 18th Century, Tokaj reached the height of its prosperity. Both Poland and Russia had become major export markets for its wine. Such was the importance of Tokaji in Russia, that the Russian emperors maintained a de facto colony in Tokaj in order to guarantee the supply of wine to the Imperial Court.

The partition of Poland in 1795 and subsequent imposition of customs duties dealt a severe blow to the exports of Tokaji wine and precipitated the economic decline of the region. However, this was only the first of three major crises for Tokaj. The second occurred when the phylloxera epidemic reached Tokaj in 1885 and destroyed the vast majority of the vineyards in a matter of years. The third shock was when Hungary lost two-thirds of its territory under the peace Treaty of Trianon signed in June 1920, and thus Tokaj wine lost access to the majority of its domestic market. The region was also divided between Hungary and the newly created Czechoslovakia, which gained an area of 120 hectares (with the exception of 1938–1944, when Hungary took control over the territory). The latter now forms part of an adjoining wine region in Slovakia with approximately 908 hectares of classified Tokaj vineyards.

The era of communist rule in Hungary saw a deterioration in the quality and reputation of Tokaji wines. However, since 1990 a considerable amount of investment has gone into the Tokaj region, creating what has been dubbed as the &quot;Tokaj Renaissance&quot;. There are now almost 600 wineries in the region, of which about 50 produce the full range of wines.

== The &quot;Designation of origin&quot; dispute ==

Tokaj wine is, by its unique character, a luxurious commodity with a strong appeal to the international market.

The dispute started in 1964 when, for the first time, the then Czechoslovakia exported its excessive production of Tokaj wine to Austria, the market that used to be solely supplied with this commodity by Hungary. The conflict of interests was settled in a bilateral agreement according to which Slovakia - at the expense of the Czech beer-related concession on Hungarian part - was only allowed to export its overproduction of Tokaj wine to Hungary (which consequently re-labeled and re-exported it). This agreement expired in 1990 after which date the dispute arose again.
An agreement was reached in June 2004 between the Hungarian and Slovak governments concerning the use of the Tokaj name in Slovakia. Under this agreement, wine produced on 5.65 km2 of land in Slovakia is able to use the &quot;Tokaj&quot; name. However, the Slovak part did not observe their legally binding undertaking, which was to introduce the same standards enshrined in Hungarian wine laws since 1990. It has not yet been decided who will monitor or enforce those laws. The disputes led Slovakia into an international lawsuit between Hungary and five other countries (Italy, France, Australia, Serbia and Slovenia), for the brand name &quot;Tokaji&quot;. (see details: Tokaji)

In November 2012, the European Court ruled against Hungary&#x27;s request to erase the Slovak entry “Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj” from “E-Bacchus”, an electronic database containing a register of designations of origin and geographical indications protected in the EU. Hungary lodged an appeal against the judgement of the General Court. In February 2013, the EU Court of Justice has turned down the Hungarian appeal against an earlier ruling concerning Slovakia&#x27;s registration of “Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj” (Tokaj Wine Region), which contains the name of Hungary&#x27;s Tokaj region. In its ruling, the court said that Slovakia&#x27;s registering its “Vinohradnícka oblasť Tokaj” in the European database E-Bacchus did not constitute an actionable measure. As a result, under the current EU legislation the wine-growing region of Tokaj is located in both Hungary and Slovakia. Therefore, wine producers from both the Hungarian Tokaj region and the Slovak Tokaj region may use the Tokaj brand name.

<text>Érico Lopes Verissimo (December 17, 1905 – November 28, 1975) was an important Brazilian writer, born in the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

==Biography==
Érico Verissimo was the son of Sebastião Verissimo da Fonseca and Abegahy Lopes Verissimo. His father, heir of a rich family in Cruz Alta, met financial ruin during his son&#x27;s youth and, as a result, Erico didn&#x27;t complete secondary school because of the need to work.

Verissimo settled in Cruz Alta as the owner of a drugstore, but was unsuccessful. He then moved to Porto Alegre in 1930, willing to live solely by selling his writing. There he began to live around writers of renown, such as Mário Quintana, Augusto Meyer, Guilhermino César and others. In the following year, he was hired to occupy the position of secretary of edition of the &quot;Revista do Globo&quot;, of which he would become editor in 1933. He then undertook the whole editorial project at Editora Globo, propelling its nationwide fame.

He published his first work, &quot;Fantoches&quot; (&quot;Puppets&quot;), in 1932, with a sequence of short stories, mostly in the form of short plays. The following year, he saw his first great success with the romance &quot;Clarissa&quot;.

Verissimo married in 1931 to Mafalda Volpe and had two children, Luis Fernando Verissimo, also a writer, and Clarissa.

In 1943 he moved with his family to the United States, where he gave lessons on Brazilian Literature in the University of California-Berkeley, until 1945. Between 1953 and 1956 he was director of the Department of Cultural Affairs of the Organization of American States, in Washington, D.C. This period of his life was recorded in some of his books, including: &quot;Gato Preto em Campo de Neve&quot; (&quot;Black Cat in a Snow Field&quot;), &quot;A Volta do Gato Preto&quot; (&quot;The Return of the Black Cat&quot;), and &quot;História da Literatura Brasileira&quot; (&quot;History of Brazilian Literature&quot;), which contains some of his lectures at UCLA. His epic &quot;O Tempo e o Vento&quot; (&quot;The Time and the Wind&#x27;&quot;) became one of the great masterpieces of the Brazilian novel, alongside &quot;Os Sertões&quot; by Euclides da Cunha, and &quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot; by Guimarães Rosa.

His historical trilogy &quot;O Tempo e o Vento&quot; (&quot;The Time and the Wind&quot;) is considered as his greatest work, written in the period of 1949-1961, from which arose primordial characters such as &quot;Ana Terra&quot; and &quot;Capitão Rodrigo&quot; that went on to become popular amongst his readers. Four of his, &quot;Time and the Wind&quot;, &quot;Night&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, and &quot;His Excellency, the Ambassador&quot;, were translated into the English language by Linton Lomas Barrett.

In 1965 Verissimo published the romance &quot;O Senhor Embaixador&quot; (&quot;His Excellency, the Ambassador&quot;), in which he reflected upon the deviations of Latin America.

In the romance &quot;Incidente em Antares&quot; (&quot;Incident in Antares&quot;), written in 1971, he traces a parallel with Brazilian politics with the use of fantasy, with the rebellion of corpses during a strike of the gravekeepers, in the fictitious city of Antares.

After suffering from a heart attack in 1975, Verissimo was unable to complete the second volume of his autobiography entitled &quot;Solo de Clarineta&quot; (&quot;Clarinet Solo&quot;), which was intended to be a trilogy, apart from a romance which would be entitled &quot;A Hora do Sétimo Anjo&quot; (&quot;The Hour of the Seventh Angel&quot;).

He was the father of another famous writer of Rio Grande do Sul, Luis Fernando Verissimo.

<doc id="1061074" wikidata="Q832395" url="?curid=1061074" title="Oseberg Ship">
<text>The Oseberg ship (Norwegian: &quot;Osebergskipet&quot;) is a well-preserved Viking ship discovered in a large burial mound at the Oseberg farm near Tønsberg in Vestfold county, Norway. This ship is commonly acknowledged to be among the finest artifacts to have survived from the Viking Age. The ship and some of its contents are displayed at the Viking Ship Museum at Bygdøy on the western side of Oslo, Norway.

Excavation of the ship from the Oseberg burial mound (Norwegian: &quot;Oseberghaugen ved Slagen&quot; from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning kurgan mound or barrow) was undertaken by Swedish archaeologist Gabriel Gustafson and Norwegian archaeologist Haakon Shetelig in 1904–1905. The grave also contained two female human skeletons as well as a considerable number of grave goods. Scientific dating of the ship suggests it was buried no earlier than 834, although certain parts of its structure date from as early as 800, while other parts may be even older.

==Structure==

The ship is a Karve, clinker built, almost entirely of oak. It is in length and broad, with a mast of approximately in height. With a likely sail area of , the ship could have achieved a speed of up to . The ship has 15 pairs of openings for oars, enabling up to 30 people to row it. Other fittings include a broad steering oar, iron anchor, gangplank, and a bailer. The bow and stern of the ship are elaborately decorated with complex woodcarvings in the characteristic &quot;gripping beast&quot; style, also known as the Oseberg style.

During the debate on whether to move the original ship to a proposed new museum, thorough investigations were made into the feasibility of moving the ship without damaging it. As part of that process, highly detailed photographic and laser scans of both the exterior and interior of the ship were made.

==Replica==
In 2004, an attempt to build a copy of the Oseberg ship was launched. A collective effort of Norwegian and Danish professional builders, scientists and volunteers engaged in this new attempt with the photo and laser scans made available free of charge to the builders. During this new attempt, it was discovered that during the initial restoration of the ship a breach in some of the beams had been made and that the ship was therefore inadvertently altered, a fact that had not been appreciated earlier. This may be why an earlier replica, the &#x27;Dronningen&#x27;, sank; this previous attempt had failed owing to a lack of this knowledge.

In 2010, a new reconstruction project called &quot;Saga Oseberg&quot; was started. Using timber from Denmark and Norway and utilizing traditional building methods from the Viking Age, this newest Oseberg ship was successfully completed. The new ship was launched from the city of Tønsberg on 20 June 2012. The ship floated very well and in March 2014 it was sailed on the open seas, with Færder as its destination; the ship performed very well, achieving a speed of 10 knots under full sail. The reconstruction was thus a success and demonstrated that the Oseberg ship really could have sailed and was not just a burial chamber on land.

==Human remains==

The skeletons of two women were found in the grave with the ship. One, probably aged around 80, suffered badly from arthritis. The older woman also had Morgagni&#x27;s syndrome, which would have given her a masculine appearance and beard. The second was initially believed to be aged 25–30, but analysis of tooth-root translucency suggests she was older (aged 50–55). It is not clear which one was the more important in life or whether one was sacrificed to accompany the other in death. The younger woman had a broken collarbone, initially thought to be evidence that she was a human sacrifice, but closer examination showed that the bone had been healing for several weeks. The opulence of the burial rite and the grave-goods suggests that this was a burial of very high status. One woman wore a very fine red wool dress with a lozenge twill pattern (a luxury commodity) and a fine white linen veil in a gauze weave, while the other wore a plainer blue wool dress with a wool veil, possibly showing some stratification in their social status. Neither woman wore anything entirely made of silk, although small silk strips were appliqued onto a tunic worn under the red dress.

Dendrochronological analysis of timbers in the grave chamber dates the burial to the autumn of 834. Although the high-ranking woman&#x27;s identity is unknown, it has been suggested that she is Queen Åsa of the Yngling clan, mother of Halfdan the Black and grandmother of Harald Fairhair. Recent tests of the women&#x27;s remains suggest that they lived in Agder in Norway, as had Queen Åsa. This theory has been challenged, however, and some think that she may have been a shaman. There were also the skeletal remains of 14 horses, an ox, and three dogs found on the ship.

According to Per Holck of the University of Oslo, the younger woman&#x27;s mitochondrial haplogroup was discovered to be U7. Her direct maternal ancestors came to Norway from the Pontic littoral, probably Iran. Three subsequent studies failed to confirm these results, however, and it is likely that the bone samples contain little (if any) original DNA or have been contaminated through handling.

Examinations of fragments of the skeletons have provided more insight into their lives. The younger woman&#x27;s teeth showed signs that she used a metal toothpick, a rare 9th century luxury. Both women had a diet composed mainly of meat, another luxury when most Vikings ate fish. However, there was not enough DNA to tell if they were related.

The women were found together in one bed.

==Grave goods==

The grave had been disturbed in antiquity, and objects made of precious metals were absent. Nevertheless, a great number of everyday items and artifacts were found during the 1904–1905 excavations. These included four elaborately decorated sleighs, a richly carved four-wheel wooden cart, bed-posts, and wooden chests, as well as the so-called &quot;Buddha bucket&quot; (&quot;Buddha-bøtte&quot;), a brass and cloisonné enamel ornament of a bucket (pail) handle in the shape of a figure sitting with crossed legs. The bucket is made from yew wood, held together with brass strips, and the handle is attached to two anthropomorphic figures compared to depictions of the Buddha in the lotus posture, although any connection is most uncertain. More relevant is the connection between the patterned enamel torso and similar human figures in the Gospel books of the Insular art of Ireland, such as the Book of Durrow. More mundane items such as agricultural and household tools were also found. A series of textiles included woolen garments, imported silks, and narrow tapestries. The Oseberg burial is one of the few sources of Viking Age textiles, and the wooden cart is the only complete Viking Age cart found so far. A bedpost shows one of the few period examples of the use of what has been dubbed the valknut symbol.

The conservation of the wooden artifacts is an ongoing problem. On May 3, 2011, thirteen years after debate began over the disposition of the ship, Norwegian Minister of Education Kristin Halvorsen stated that the ship will not be moved from Bygdøy.

<doc id="1061075" wikidata="Q321061" url="?curid=1061075" title="FC Sion">
<text>Football Club Sion, commonly known as simply FC Sion or Sion, is a Swiss football club from the city of Sion. The club was founded in 1909 and play their home matches at the Stade Tourbillon. They have won the Swiss Super League and the Swiss Cup in 13 of their 14 appearances in the final, the most recent being in 2015. The first team of the club was also known as their incorporated name Olympique des Alpes SA. The club set to play in the Super League from 2024 to 2025, the top tier of Swiss football after promotion from Challenge League in 2023–24.

==History==
FC Sion were founded in 1909 by Robert Gilliard, who became club captain, and played their first match the same year, a 3–2 win against FC Aigle. The club grew thanks to contributions from locals, and played their first competitive league fixture in 1914, again a 3–2 victory, against FC Monthey. In 1919, Sion formally organised its managerial structure, with Gilliard becoming vice-president and Charles Aymon taking the presidency.

From 1932, Sion played in the fourth tier of Swiss football, where they spent much of the next 20 years, briefly interrupted by promotion to the third tier in 1944, quickly followed by relegation in 1946. In 1952, Sion returned to the third tier. Five years later, Sion gained promotion again to the National League B, followed five years later by promotion to the National League A (now the Swiss Super League) in 1962. 1965 saw the first of Sion&#x27;s Swiss Cup wins following a 2–1 victory over Servette.

The 16,263 capacity Stade Tourbillon was officially opened in August 1968, but the club was relegated in 1969. Sion returned to the National League A at the first attempt and secured a second victory in the Swiss Cup, winning 3–2 against Neuchâtel Xamax in 1974. Sion would go on to consistently perform well in the Swiss Cup, with victories in 1980 (against Young Boys), 1982 (against Basel), 1986 (against Servette) and 1991 (against Young Boys). This period of success also saw the renovation and expansion of the Tourbillon in 1989, and was crowned with Sion&#x27;s first Swiss League Championship in 1992.

More success in the Swiss Cup followed, winning the tournament in three consecutive years from 1995 with victories over Grasshopper, Servette and Luzern. Their win against Luzern in 1997 secured Sion their only domestic double, having also won the Swiss League.

However, the club quickly fell into financial trouble, and having narrowly avoided bankruptcy due to its purchase by Gilbert Kadji, the club suffered relegation in 1999. Despite returning to the top division the following season, financial problems plagued the team, culminating in relegation in 2001, the departure of Kadji and a denial of a professional license in 2003. The club was saved by architect and former footballer Christian Constantin, and they were re-instated into the second division in October 2003.

Constantin spent the following seasons rebuilding the club, with the club going through 20 managers in the following eight years, including taking the role himself twice, in a bid to financially stabilize. In 2006, He was rewarded with promotion back to the Super League, as well as a victory in the Swiss Cup, becoming the first second-tier team to achieve this, with a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over Young Boys after a 1–1 draw.

===Transfer ban saga===
In 2008, controversy came to Sion when they signed Essam El Hadary, leading to a two-year &quot;registration period&quot; ban for Sion from June 2009, and an international playing ban for El Hadary for four months, due to El-Hadary still being under contract at his former club Al Ahly. Sion appealed this action, but the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland confirmed the FIFA, DRC and Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decisions in 2009 and 2010 respectively. However, the lengthy legal battle (including the temporary reprieve) meant the ban was only practically instituted beginning in the winter transfer window of the 2010–11 season.

Although gaining a place in the qualifying round of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League by winning the previous season&#x27;s Swiss Cup, Sion were excluded from the Europa League by UEFA after fielding ineligible players in their play-off victory against Celtic. On 2 September, the Swiss Football League (SFL) rejected the registration of one more player, Brian Amofa.

On 30 September 2011, the SFL decided to provisionally qualify the six new signings, namely Stefan Glarner, Billy Ketkeophomphone, Mario Mutsch, Pascal Feindouno, José Gonçalves and Gabri, to comply with the ongoing legal process. Sion also sued the SFL and UEFA respectively in the Tribunal Cantonal de Valais and the Tribunal in Vaud, however both actions were dismissed. The club&#x27;s earlier appeal was dismissed by UEFA Appeals Body on 13 September. Sion also sued the SFL and UEFA in the CAS, but withdrew the former claim. The hearing of the latter claim was set on 24 November.

On 25 October, the Discipline Commission (fr: &quot;Commission de discipline&quot;) of SFL suspended all six players for five matches. It was reported that each player filed their legal claim in civil court instead of using the Swiss FA and CAS &quot;sports court&quot; system, which the ban was requested by FIFA. On 27 October, as a &quot;provisional and super-provisional measures&quot;, UEFA invited Sion to a match schedule consultation once UEFA lost the legal battle.

On 31 October 2011, Sion sent a complaint to the European Commission. FIFA also won the legal battle in civil court in November. Previously, the civil court of Martigny and Saint-Maurice (both of the city of Valais) ordered FIFA to confirm the signing of those six players on 3 August, a consequence of lawsuit brought out by the players. On 16 November, FIFA and the SFL appeal was upheld in the Valais canton court.

On 15 December, the CAS upheld the complaints by UEFA, affirming its right to discipline Sion according to previous agreements. The CAS also lifted the provisional measures ordered by the Tribunal Cantonal of Vaud (Cour civile) on 5 October 2011. After the ruling, FIFA threatened to suspend Swiss national and club teams from international competition if Sion were not appropriately penalized for its ostensible rules violations. In late December 2011, the Swiss Football Association complied with FIFA&#x27;s demands and penalized Sion 36 standings points (based on how many matches ineligible players were involved), moving the club to last place in the league standings and putting the club at risk of relegation if the ruling stood.

Sion finished the 2011–12 season in ninth place, which qualified them to the relegation matches against Aarau, whom they defeated 2–1 on aggregate to stay in the Swiss Super League. Without suffering their 36-point deduction Sion would have finished in the third place, which would have qualified them into the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, they made a major coup by signing Gennaro Gattuso and Kyle Lafferty, both via free transfers. However, the club had a disappointing season which saw them change coaches three times before settling on Gattuso to finish the season, ending in third place.

Sion finished the 2014–15 season in second place as runner-up, which qualified to the UEFA Europa League Group Stage for the first time in history from next season. In 2015–16, Sion reached to Round of 32 Europa League until Eliminated by S.C. Braga with aggregate 3–4.

===Suffering relegation and return to top tier===
In 2022–23, Sion relegation to Challenge League after defeat from Stade Lausanne Ouchy 2-6 and ended top tier in 17 years. Following season, Sion secure promotion to Super League after defeat FC Schaffhausen 3–0 on 20 May 2024 as Champions of Challenge League for the first time in history in 2023–24 and return to top tier after a year absence.

==Honours==
Sion held the distinction of having never lost a domestic cup final, with 13 wins in 13 appearances in the Swiss Cup, until a defeat by Basel in the 2017 edition.

;Notes
*Note 1: Celtic lodged protests over the eligibility of a number of the Sion players who participated in the two legs of the play-off round, which Sion won 3–1 aggregate (first leg: 0–0; second leg: 3–1). The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body accepted the protests and decided to award both matches to Celtic by forfeit (3–0). As a consequence, Celtic qualified for the UEFA Europa League group stage.

<text>O Senhor Embaixador (English: &quot;His Excellency, the Ambassador&quot;) is a novel by Erico Verissimo, about the history of the fictional Republic of Sacramento. The story focuses mainly on the staff of the Sacramentese embassy in Washington, showing the lives of those people and talking about the larger plot of the Sacramento &quot;Republic&quot;.

== Sacramento ==
The Sacramento depicted in the novel seems to be an amalgam of various Latin American countries of the time, exhibiting the common problems of dictatorship, corruption, instability, inequality and pressures from the superpowers, especially the United States, that are depicted in the novel as directly influencing through military incursions and economic pressure the political, economic and social state of Sacramento, mainly in order to benefit American multinational corporations in the country (references are made to &quot;War is a Racket&quot;). Sacramento also exhibits a resemblance to Cuba, especially by the end of the book, when a revolution led by a messianic figure (who is actually a puppet controlled by a radical communist), overthrows a US supported dictator.

<text>Chernorizets Hrabar (, &quot;Črĭnorizĭcĭ Hrabrŭ&quot;, ) was a Bulgarian monk, scholar and writer who is credited as the author of &quot;On the Letters&quot;. He worked at the Preslav Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century.

== Name and historicity ==
His appellation is correctly translated as &quot;Hrabar, the Black Robe Wearer&quot; (i.e., Hrabar The Monk), &quot;chernorizets&quot; being the lowest rank in the monastic hierarchy (translatable as &quot;black robe-wearer&quot;, see and ), &quot;Hrabar&quot; (&quot;Hrabr&quot;) supposed to be his given name. However, sometimes he is referred to as &quot;Chernorizets the Brave&quot;, &quot;the Brave One&quot; or &quot;Brave&quot; which is the translation of &quot;Hrabar&quot; assumed to be a nickname.

The authorship of his work and his identity have been a matter of scholarly debate. His name has been theorized as a pseudonym used by some of the other famous men of letters such as Constantine, John the Exarch, Clement of Ohrid or even by Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria himself.

== &quot;On the Letters&quot; ==

Chernorizets Hrabar is the credited author of only one literary work, &quot;On the Letters&quot; (, O pismenĭhŭ, ), a popular medieval treatise written in Old Church Slavonic. The work was written in the late ninth or early tenth century. It was partly based on Greek scholia and grammar treatises and expounded on the origin of the Glagolitic alphabet and Slavic Bible translation.

He also provided information critical to Slavonic paleography with his mention that the pre-Christian Slavs employed &quot;strokes and incisions&quot; (, &quot;črŭty i rězy&quot;, translated as &quot;tallies and sketches&quot; below) writing that was, apparently, insufficient properly to reflect the spoken language. It is thought that this may have been a form of runic script but no authentic examples are known to have survived. The dominant view among scholars is that Hrabar was defending Slavonic in response to Greek criticism, while others have argued that his text was a defense of Glagolithic against Cyrillic.

===Manuscript copies===
The manuscript of &quot;On the Letters&quot; has been preserved in 79 copies in seven families of texts, including five contaminated manuscripts, plus four abridgements independent of the seven families. All of these families probably ultimately share a common . Not one of the textual families contains an optimal text, and none of them can be established to be the source of any other. None of the text families can be shown to have dialectal features, albeit some of the individual manuscripts in the families do have them. The protograph was written in Glagolitic, and it underwent significant change or corruption in the course of its successive transcription into seven families of Cyrillic texts. Today only Cyrillic manuscripts survive. The of all seven families give the number of the letters in the alphabet as 38, but the original Glagolitic alphabet had only 36, as attested in the acrostic of Constantine of Preslav; however, one of the abridgements instead gives the number as 37 and another gives it as 42.

The oldest surviving manuscript copy dates back to 1348 and was made by the monk Laurentius for Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria. The work has also been printed in Vilnius (1575–1580), Moscow (1637), Saint Petersburg (1776), Supraśl (1781). It is the earliest printed work of an early Bulgarian author, included as part of the 1578 version of Ivan Fеdorov&#x27;s East Slav primer.

=== Excerpt ===

:&quot;Being still pagans, the Slavs did not have their own letters, but read and communicated by means of tallies and sketches. After their baptism they were forced to use Roman and Greek letters in the transcription of their Slavic words but these were not suitable ... At last, God, in his love for mankind, sent them St. Constantine the Philosopher, called Cyril, a learned and upright man, who composed for them thirty-eight letters, some (24 of them) similar to the Greek, but some (14 of them) different, suitable to express Slavic sounds.&quot;

==Legacy==

Hrabar Nunatak on Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named for Chernorizets Hrabar.

<doc id="1061101" wikidata="Q6557380" url="?curid=1061101" title="Liquid News">
<text>Liquid News was a daily round up of entertainment news for BBC Three (and before that BBC Choice) running from 30 May 2000 to 1 April 2004. The show was also broadcast weekly on BBC One and internationally on BBC Prime and BBC America.

The programme originally evolved from &quot;Zero 30&quot;, the previous entertainment programme on BBC News 24. Once this was dropped from the 24-hour news channel, controller of the then BBC Choice, Stuart Murphy, took the format and brought it to the channel where it soon became the flagship programme.

==Format==
Each show started with a rundown of the headlines that featured in that edition of Liquid News after the main titles and the host introducing themselves. The show featured celebrity news from around the world (though mainly the UK), including live reports from staff in New York, Los Angeles and Cannes during the Cannes Film Festival.

Every edition had guests in the studio with the host to provide their opinions on the news featured, offer their views and to reflect with the host on those stories and to plug their own shows or records that they were promoting at the time.

The show would divide itself into sections of discussion which usually fell into the categories of Music, Film, Television and sometimes Sport which featured a main story of a pre-recorded or insert live from the regular roster of Liquid News reporters.

A number of special editions of &quot;Liquid News&quot; were made to celebrate major events in the celebrity world, which left the usual confines of the studio. One such edition took place at a rooftop pool in which Christopher Price was behind a small tiki bar with the guests sitting on bar stools.

==Cancellation==
In April 2004 the show was cancelled. Murphy, controller of BBC Three and who originally commissioned &quot;Liquid News&quot; for BBC Choice, stated that the show would end as a way to &quot;refresh the channel&#x27;s output to best serve the audience&quot;. The news element of the channel was unaffected by the ending of the programme with &quot;60 Seconds&quot; and &quot;The 7 O&#x27;Clock News&quot; already in existence with the latter revamped as a half hour programme with a larger budget to replace Liquid News. &quot;The 7 O&#x27;Clock News&quot; was later axed in December 2005, while &quot;60 Seconds&quot; departed screens alongside the original incarnation of BBC Three as a linear channel in February 2016. Since BBC Three&#x27;s return to linear television in 2022, its news output has solely consisted of &quot;The Catch Up&quot;.

==Presenters==
&quot;Liquid News&quot; was originally a vehicle for presenter Christopher Price. Following his death on 21 April 2002, the show continued with a variety of presenters, beginning with Dale Winton and also including Colin Paterson, Claudia Winkleman, Julia Morris, Iain Lee, Jasmine Lowson, Paddy O&#x27;Connell, Lorraine Kelly, Phill Jupitus, Julian Clary, Jonathan Ross, Jo Whiley, Joe Mace and Amanda Byram.

The programme was relaunched on 6 October 2002, with Claudia Winkleman and Colin Paterson becoming the main presenters alongside new branding and the introduction of a Sunday night edition, whilst Julia Morris and Heat editor Mark Frith presented a revamped Friday evening edition. In July 2003, Paddy O&#x27;Connell replaced Colin Patterson, who remained on the programme as a reporter.

==Reporters==
The lineup of reporting staff included Colin Paterson, Stephanie West, Vanessa Langford, Tamzin Sylvester and Ruth Liptrot.

==Theme music==
Both versions of the theme tune have been composed by Moby, the first of which being an original composition that had not been included on the &quot;Play&quot; album titled &quot;Bedhead&quot;. The second was a DJ Tiesto remix of &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;, which featured on the single release.

<text>Matigge is a village of 1095 inhabitants in the Italian province of Perugia in east central Umbria, located at 294 m (965 ft) above sea-level on the lower flank of Mt. Puranno, 42°54N 12°44E. It is a &quot;frazione&quot; of Trevi, which lies 3 km (2 mi) to the south.

==History and main sights==

The origin of the town&#x27;s name is unknown, but may derive from Latin &quot;(villa) Matidiae&quot;: Matidia Minor. Matidia Minor was a noble Roman woman, a distant cousin and sister-in-law of Emperor Hadrian. This town is also named after Matidia&#x27;s mother Salonia Matidia and her late maternal grandfather Praetor Gaius Salonius Matidius Patruinus. Matidia was known to have had a villa in Umbria and Matidia was a wealthy and socially conscious woman, responsible for one of the grander building schemes in Ostia. Hadrian restored a large chunk of the Umbrian Via Flaminia in AD 123‑124; it is thus an appealing, if unproven, theory, that Hadrian would have had the need for restoring the road personally brought home to him as he travelled it back and forth to his daughter&#x27;s hypothetical villa.

Matigge does in fact boast of Roman remains: traces of small Roman roads, and significant Roman spolia used in the construction of the attractive Romanesque church of S. Donato. A second small Romanesque church in town is S. Niccolò.

<doc id="1061108" wikidata="Q716455" url="?curid=1061108" title="Formosan black bear">
<text>The Formosan Black Bear (, Ursus thibetanus formosanus), also known as the Taiwanese black bear or white-throated bear, is a subspecies of the Asiatic black bear. It was first described by Robert Swinhoe in 1864. Formosan black bears are endemic to Taiwan. They are also the largest land animals and the only native bears (&quot;Ursidae&quot;) in Taiwan. They are seen to represent the Taiwanese nation. 

Because of severe exploitation and habitat degradation in recent decades, populations of wild Formosan black bears have been declining. This species was listed as &quot;endangered&quot; under Taiwan&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Act () in 1989. Their geographic distribution is restricted to remote, rugged areas at elevations of . The estimated number of individuals is 200 to 600.

==Physical characteristics==
The Formosan black bear is sturdily built and has a round head, short neck, small eyes, and long snout. Its head measures in length and in circumference. Its ears are long. Its snout resembles a dog&#x27;s, hence its nickname is &quot;dog bear&quot;. Its tail is inconspicuous and short—usually less than long. Its body is well covered with rough, glossy, black hair, which can grow over 10 cm long around the neck. The tip of its chin is white. On the chest, there is a distinctive yellowish or white mark that is shaped like a &quot;V&quot; character or a crescent moon. This earns it another nickname—&quot;lunar bear&quot;. It weighs from .

==Diet==

They feed primarily on leaves, buds, fruits, roots, although they also eat insects, small animals, and carrion. Diets of bears monitored in Yushan National Park include succulent vegetation in spring, soft fruits rich in carbohydrate in summer, and fat-loaded hard mast (e.g., acorn and walnut) in fall/winter.

== Distribution ==
It is believed that it was once widespread across Taiwan (Formosa). It is now mostly confined to the mountain ranges. It can be found along the Central and Snow mountain ranges. The largest population of bears seem to be Lala mountain in Chatienshan Reserve, the (Snow) Mountain area in Sheipa National Park, and Taroko National Park south to Tawushan Reserve through Yushan National Park.

== Habitat and behavior ==
The Formosan bear lives in the mountainous forests in the eastern two-thirds of Taiwan at elevations of . In the winter, rather than hibernating like Asiatic black bears in temperate areas, they move to lower elevations to find food. They are active for 54–57% of daylight hours, and more active during summer (60%) and fall/winter (60%) than spring (47%). They are primarily active during the day in the spring and summer; and increasingly active at night in the fall/winter when acorns are abundant. They are solitary and usually move around extensively except during the mating season or when caring for cubs. Formosan bears are also the only bears on the planet that make temporary nests.

Formosan black bears can easily outrun humans, reaching speeds of per hour. They are skilled at swimming and climbing, as well. Because of their endangered species status and their habit of avoiding humans, Formosan black bears are rarely seen in the wild. In most encounters the bear retreats and runs away from humans. Even though bears can be aggressive, they only harm things that harm them, and rarely attack humans without provocation.

==Reproduction==
As solitary animals, Formosan black bears do not stay in fixed shelters, except for females during their breeding period. The bear&#x27;s courtship period is very brief. A male trails after a female for a few days. After mating, they return to their solitary lives. Females reach sexual maturity at age 3–4 and males reach sexual maturity at age 4–5, usually one year later than females. Mating is usually from June to August and pregnancy lasts for 6–7 months. Thus, wild females usually give birth between December and the following February.

Each birth produces 1–3 cubs. Cubs will be nursed by mother for about six months. When they are strong enough to leave the den, bear cubs will remain with the mother for approximately two years, until the mother enters the next cycle of estrus and drives the cubs off. This forms the 2-year reproductive cycle of Formosan black bears.
==Conservation==

===Hunter and hunted===

Formosan black bears () and Formosan clouded leopards () — two of the largest terrestrial mammals on the island of Taiwan — used to roam over the ranges and mountains of Taiwan. However, while the leopard is now extinct, the bear, though endangered, has survived. According to research by the Institute of Wildlife Conservation, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, this may be due to the myths and traditional taboos of Taiwanese aborigines.

Bunun people call black bears &quot;Aguman&quot; or &quot;Duman&quot;, which means the devil. If a Bunun hunter&#x27;s trap accidentally traps a bear, he has to build a cottage in the mountains and burn the body of the bear there. He also has to stay in the cottage alone away from the village until the millet harvest is finished. Rukai and Paiwan people are allowed to hunt bears, but the hunters have to pay the price of carrying the ancient curse in return. Rukai people believe hunting bears can result in disease. Also, not everyone is allowed to eat bear meat, and children are strictly forbidden to do so. In Taroko (Truku) legend, Formosan black bears are respectful &quot;kings of the forest&quot;, whose white marks on their chests represent the moon. The Taroko people believe that killing black bears results in family disaster. In general, among these hunting tribes, hunters of boars are respected as heroes, while hunters of bears are considered losers.

===Endangered species===

From 1998 to 2000, 15 Formosan black bears were captured and radio collared in Yushan National Park. Reported bear sightings are very infrequent and no one knows exactly how many bears still exist. The species has been legally protected since 1989 but illegal hunting continues and such poaching continues to threaten Formosan black bear populations. For example, eight of fifteen bears captured in the above survey had missing toes or paws, caused by illegal traps.

Since 1989, Formosan black bears have been listed as endangered animals and protected by Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Cultural Heritage Preservation Law&quot; (). Internationally, the entire species of Asiatic black bear is listed on Appendix I of CITES. CITES bans all international trade of any products from this species. The species is also listed on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) as vulnerable.

An indigenous Bunun hunter once said, &quot;If there were no bears in the mountains, the forest would look empty and I would feel lonely.&quot; Mei-Hsiu Hwang of Institute of Wildlife Conservation, a campaigner for black-bear preservation, also said: &quot;We do not wish to lose this soul of Taiwan&#x27;s mountains. We do not wish our offspring to see them only in the zoo or in history books.&quot;

There is still hope for the Formosan black bear. In 2009, Lin Yuan-Yuan (a member of Yushan National Park&#x27;s black bear conservation group) recorded footage showing a mother bear attempting to help her two cubs cross a rapid near Batongguan Trail in the eastern section of Tafen ().

== Popular culture ==
In 2001, they were voted the most representative wildlife of Taiwan in a half-year-long countrywide voting campaign.

Taiwanese pilots have worn morale patches which feature a Formosan black bear punching Winnie-the-Pooh (representing Xi Jinping) in the face.

<doc id="1061121" wikidata="Q552684" url="?curid=1061121" title="Michael Sendivogius">
<text>Michael Sendivogius (; ; 2 February 1566 – 1636) was a Polish alchemist, philosopher, and physician. A pioneer of chemistry, he developed ways of purifying and creating various acids, metals, and other chemicals. 

He discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance – later called oxygen – 170 years before Scheele&#x27;s discovery of the element. He correctly identified this &quot;food of life&quot; with the gas (also oxygen) given off by heating nitre (saltpetre). This substance, the &quot;central nitre&quot;, had a central position in Sendivogius&#x27; schema of the universe.

==Biography==

Little is known of his early life: he was born into a noble family that was part of the Clan of Ostoja. His father sent him to study in university of Kraków but Sendivogius visited also most of the European countries and universities; he studied at Vienna, Altdorf, Leipzig and Cambridge. His acquaintances included John Dee and Edward Kelley. It was thanks to him that King Stephen Báthory agreed to finance their experiments. In the 1590s, he was active in Prague, at the famously open-minded court of Emperor Rudolf II.
In Poland, he appeared at the court of King Sigismund III Vasa around 1600, and quickly achieved great fame, as the Polish king was himself an alchemy enthusiast and even conducted experiments with Sendivogius. In Kraków&#x27;s Wawel castle, the chamber where his experiments were performed is still intact. The more conservative Polish nobles soon came to dislike him for encouraging the king to expend vast sums of money on chemical experimentation. The more practical aspects of his work in Poland involved the design of mines and metal foundries. His widespread international contacts led to his employment as a diplomat from about 1600.

In his later years, Sendivogius spent more time in Bohemia and Moravia (now in the Czech Republic), where he had been granted lands by the Habsburg emperor. Near the end of his life, he settled in Prague, in the court of Rudolf II, where he gained even more fame as a designer of metal mines and foundries. However the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618-48 had effectively ended the golden age of alchemy: the rich patrons now spent their money on financing war rather than chemical speculation, and he died in relative obscurity.

==Works==
Daniel Stolcius in his &quot;Viridarium Chymicum&quot; (1624) praises Sendivogius as the author of twelve books. The most famous of these was his &quot;New Chemical Light&quot;, published in 1604. Besides a relatively clear exposition of his theory on the existence of a &quot;food of life&quot; in air, his books contain various scientific, pseudo-scientific and philosophical theories, and were repeatedly translated and widely read among such worthies as Isaac Newton into the 18th century.

==Sendivogius in fiction==

The first appearance of this character in fiction was in the 1845 book &quot;Sędziwoj&quot; by , a writer during the times of romanticism in Poland. In early 2000s he appeared in several books by the Polish writer Andrzej Pilipiuk (&quot;Kuzynki&quot; 2003, &quot;Księżniczka&quot; 2004, &quot;Dziedziczki&quot; 2005). Sendivogius is also a character in the novel of Gustav Meyrink (part of &quot;Goldmachergeschichten, August Scherl Verlag, Berlin 1925&quot;), a German author from Prague, Bohemia, who often wrote about alchemy and alchemists.

The Polish 19th-century realist painter Jan Matejko depicted Sendivogius demonstrating a transmutation of a base metal into gold before King Sigismund III Vasa.

He was also shown (thinly disguised) as the Alchemist Sendivogius in a Polish TV series &quot;Alchemik Sendivius&quot; in the 1980s.

==Writings==
*&quot;De Lapide Philosophorum Tractatus duodecim e naturae fonte et manuali experientia deprompti&quot;. 1604. 
** Also known as &quot;Novum Lumen Chymicum&quot; (New Chemical Light), the first Latin editions were published simultaneously in Prague and Frankfurt.

<text>Jizzakh ( ; , ) is a city and the center of Jizzakh Region in Uzbekistan, located in the northeast of Samarkand. It is a district-level city. The population of Jizzakh is 179,200 (2020 est.).

== Etymology ==
According to one view, the name of the city comes from the Sogdian word &quot;dizak&quot; (), which is the diminutive form of &quot;diz&quot; () and means &quot;small fortress&quot; or &quot;small fort&quot;. It was mentioned in the 13th century Mu&#x27;jam al-Buldan under the name &quot;dīzak&quot; ().

== History ==
=== Early and Medieval history ===
Jizzakh was an important Silk Road junction on the road connecting Samarkand with the Fergana Valley. It is at the edge of Golodnaya Steppe, and next to the strategic Pass of Jilanuti (Timur&#x27;s Gate) in the Turkestan Mountains, controlling the approach to the Zeravshan Valley, Samarkand and Bukhara. After the Arab conquest of Sogdiana, Jizzakh served as a market town between the nomadic raiders and settled farmers. The Arabs built a series of &quot;rabats&quot; (blockhouses) at Jizzakh, housing &quot;ghazis&quot; to protect the people. Under the Abbasids, rule of the region of Osrushana was given over to the house of Saman, who split the wider region amongst themselves under Abbasid suzerainty. In 892, Ismail Samani united the regions under his family&#x27;s control, and effectively gained the region&#x27;s independence from the Abbasids, founding the Samanid Empire.

After the fall of the Samanid&#x27;s around the year 1000, Jizzakh fell under the rule of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. The Khanate had a string of successes, conquering the whole region of Transoxiana and pushing east into the Western Tarim Basin. In 1041, the khanate splintered into two. After a decade of infighting, the split was formalized into an eastern and western khanate, with Jizzakh falling into the western portion. After their conquest of Samarkand in 1086, the Seljuk Empire forced the western khanate to submit to their rule.

Jizzakh next fell under the control of the Khwarazmian Empire, who began as vassals to the Seljuks but eventually managed to become fully independent by 1190. Under their rule, they conquered much of Persia and Central Asia, leading to economic growth. This situation of relative prosperity was brought to an abrupt end in 1219 when the newly formed Mongol Empire invaded Khwarazmia. The Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire was one of their most brutal campaigns, and many cities were destroyed including Jizzakh. In 1220, the city was invaded and destroyed, resulting in most of the population being killed and the majority of the city being leveled. Under Mongol rule, the city struggled to recover, and went into a state of decay.

The Mongol Empire was divided among the grandsons of Genghis Khan, Jizzakh was included in the portion known as the Chagatai Khanate. This Khanate included Transoxiana, the Fergana Valley, the Tarim Basin, the region around Turpan, and much of what is today southern Kazakhstan. Despite being a key piece of the great Mongol Empire, the Chagatai Khanate began to fragment as early as the year 1300. In the 1340s, the khanate split into two. Moghulistan, or the eastern portion, retained the Tarim Basin and southern Kazakhstan. Jizzakh fell into the western portion, which was initially controlled by Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur, the last independently powerful Khan in the Transoxiana region.

In 1346 a tribal chief, Amir Qazaghan, killed Qazan and set up a puppet Khan. This marked a new era of khans with Mongol ancestry being used as politically legitimizing puppets, but lacking any real control. In 1370, after defeating his rivals in the region, Timur took control of Transoxiana, including Jizzakh. Early in his career, Timur fought regularly with Moghulistan to his north and east. Jizzakh, geographically near the border of Timur&#x27;s realm and Moghulistan and controlling a key mountain pass, was likely rebuilt and refortified during this period.

=== Uzbek khanates ===
Under the Timurid Empire, Central Asia experienced a blossoming of art and culture. Jizzakh, with its proximity to the empire&#x27;s northern border and location of trade routes to the capital Samarkand likely experienced growth and revitalization. The empire began to weaken in the second half of the 15th century. In 1488, an Uzbek contingent led by Muhammad Shaybani helped Moghulistan defeat the Timurids in their attempt to conquer Tashkent, at the Battle of the Chirciq River. After this Timurid defeat, their power fell while Shaybani&#x27;s power grew in the area between Tashkent and Samarkand. It is unclear if Jizzakh was held by Shaybani or as a Timurid bastion in these early years of Shaybani&#x27;s rise to power. In 1500, he certainly controlled the city, as he needed it in his campaign to take the Timurid capital of Samarkand. In the next ten years his forces also captured Bukhara, Herat, and most of the surrounding region.

Shaybani established the Khanate of Bukhara, which would control Jizzakh for the next 100 years. Between 1600 and the mid 1700s, Jizzakh regularly changed hands, often functioning independently of neighboring powers. Uzbek nobility controlled the city during this era. In the 1740s, the emirs of Bukhara seized power from the remaining leaders of the Khanate of Bukhara. At some point between this time, and the official founding of the Emirate of Bukhara in 1785, Jizzakh fell under the control of the Emirs. It would stay as a part of the Emirate of Bukhara until the 1860s.

In 1866, Jizzakh was a major fortress for the Emirate of Bukhara. This was in part due to its position near the border with Russian Turkestan. The Russian conquest of Central Asia had begun in the 18th century, and by the 1860s the Russians controlled a line of forts along the Syr Darya, just 70 miles from Jizzakh. In 1864, hostilities broke out between the Russians and the Emirate of Bukhara. Russian General Mikhail Chernyayev, the “Lion of Tashkent” failed in his first attempt to take Jizzakh, but succeed in his second try, with a loss of 6 men, against 6000 dead for the defenders. The old town was mostly destroyed, its remaining inhabitants evicted, and Russian settlers brought in.

=== Russian Empire ===
After its incorporation into the Russian Empire, Imperial agents placed Jizzakh under the jurisdiction of the Samarkand Oblast following its establishment in 1887. At the turn of the 19th century, the region was populated by what the Russian authorities qualified as ethnic Uzbeks, who made up more than half of the population, with Tajiks constituting another quarter of the population and other ethnicities including Kazakhs and Uyghurs making up the rest. After a railway was built to Tashkent in 1906, Russian settlers began to pour into the region. This led to resentment, and land was often seized from locals by the government and given over to settlers. While few settlers moved to the Jizzakh region, Russian policies of land surveying, and redistribution angered natives who had their rights to grazing land and other key commodities restricted by the government.

In 1916, Jizzakh was a center of an anti-Russian uprising. The revolt broke out after the Russians announced local men would be conscripted to do manual labor behind the front lines during World War I. This violated treaties the Russians had signed with during their conquest of the region that had promised to not conscripted locals. Most of the revolt was focused in the southern portions of the Jizzakh region, both the city and the mountains south of it. In 1917, Jizzakh&#x27;s most famous native son, Sharof Rashidov, future secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan, was born. 

=== Soviet administration ===
During the Russian civil war, Jizzakh was initially a part of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. After a debate among the communists about whether the region should embrace a more pan-Turkish identity, or be divided into smaller ethnic republics, the later side won out. National delimitation in Central Asia was started in 1924, and Jizzakh was placed in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.

== Geography ==
Jizzakh is an ancient oasis. The Turkestan and Nurata ridges, which surround the southern and part of the western part of the country, and the Arnasay-Aydar-Tuzkan lakes in the northern part of the country, provides a temperate climate. The peaks are covered with snow and glaciers, Chovkar mountain, in the foothills of the Usturshona system there are thick pine forests.

From the slopes of the mountains at an altitude of 1,800 meters above sea level, pine forests begin. As the mountains rise, the pine forest thickens.

There are more than 20 caves in the region. Although they have not been studied by experts, only amateurs who have observed the Peshawar cave recall that inside the cave there is a large and long square (hall), a red hearth, paintings on stone walls and petroglyphic inscriptions abound. In addition, the long cave is artificially fenced and additional stairs are made for the next hall, which testifies to the fact that primitive people lived here in ancient times.

The huge cave south of Mount Molguzar was once used as a Buddhist temple. The book &quot;History of the Sui Dynasty&quot; also mentions the Eastern TSao (Usturshona), &quot;There is the city of Yecha. It is a closed cave in the city and is sacrificed twice a year. Or the cultural Tavakbulak, located on the shoulders of Mount Molguzar at an altitude of two thousand six hundred meters above sea level, can be called a miracle. On the river Aktash in Bakhmal district there is a huge cemetery on the shoulders of steep mountains, next to it there is a magnificent gorge &quot;Blood Drop&quot;.

Or the spring that rises from the Suffa Square at the top of the mountain in Zaamin district, the nearby Muzbulak, the garden built on the top of a high mountain in Bakhmal - all this speaks of ancient history. Rivers attached to the mountains, springs flowing from glaciers, groves covering the ravines. About 100 medicinal herbs... On the banks of the Poyimard river in Jizzakh district, in the middle of a 20-meter-high rocky outcrop, all of them are natural monuments, all of which testify to the existence of primitive man.

=== Climate ===
Jizzakh has a sharply continental version of a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;). January lows average and July highs average . The climate at the foot of the mountains is milder than that of deserts and steppes. Annual precipitation is in the south and in the north. The frost-free period totals between 210 and 240 days, whilst annual sunshine totals 2800 to 3000 hours. There are many rivers flowing from the mountains, of which the largest are Sangzor and Zaamin.

== Demography==
The population of the city as of 2020 was 179,900. The overwhelming part of the population is Uzbeks.

The number of the city&#x27;s residents is constantly growing, which is due to the general growth of the country&#x27;s population, as well as the fact that the city as an administrative center is attractive to the population of its own and visitors from other regions.

National composition as of 2011: Uzbeks — 140,700 people (87.8%), Russians — 6,300 people (3.9%), Tajiks — 2,720 people (1.7%), others (including Kazakhs, Tatars, Ukrainians, Kyrgyz and others) — 10,600 people (6.6%).

<text>The Times Atlas of the World, rebranded The Times Atlas of the World: Comprehensive Edition in its 11th edition and The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World from its 12th edition, is a world atlas currently published by HarperCollins Publisher L.L.C. Its most recent edition, the sixteenth, was published on October 12th, 2023.

==Editions==
===First generation===
The first version of &quot;The Times Atlas of the World&quot; appeared as &quot;The Times Atlas&quot; in 1895; more printings followed up to 1900. It was published at the office of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in London, and contained 117 pages of maps with an alphabetical index of 130,000 names. The atlas was a reprint of Cassell &amp; Co.&#x27;s &quot;Universal Atlas&quot;, published in 1893. Cassell&#x27;s atlas, in turn, used maps in English printed in Leipzig which were drawn from the second edition (1887; with some maps of the third edition (1893)) of the German &quot;Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas&quot; from the publisher Velhagen &amp; Klasing.

===Second generation===
The second generation of the atlas was issued in 1922 as &quot;The Times Survey Atlas of the World&quot; and was prepared at the Edinburgh Geographical Institute under the direction of John George Bartholomew. It contained 112 double page maps with 200,000 names, and measured 47 cm × 33 cm.

===Third generation===
The third generation, based on the second, was Bartholomew&#x27;s famous five-volume set of 19&quot;×12&quot; elephant folio atlases with 120 plates in eight colors, most maps being double page, and over 200,000 names. The set was issued from 1955–59 as &quot;The Times Atlas of the World. Mid-Century Edition&quot; by The Times Publishing Company Ltd. in London, (Volume One: The World, Australasia &amp; East Asia. Volume Two: South-West Asia &amp; Russia. Volume Three: Northern Europe. Volume Four: Southern Europe &amp; Africa. Volume Five: The Americas; however, volumes III-V were in fact published first.) A July, 1957 advertisement for The Americas volume suggested that the maps included the latest places of note: &quot;the St. Lawrence Seaway, the newest Federal and Interstate highway systems, ... rocket-launching sites and Atomic Energy installations.&quot;

In 1967, an edition in one volume (in which the maps were printed back-to-back – some on a fractionally smaller scale) was published as &quot;The Times Atlas of the World. Comprehensive Edition&quot; (with 123 leaves of maps in the 9th edition of 1992). This edition also appeared in a German, a Dutch and a French translation. Its introduction reads: &quot;The successor to [the Mid-Century Edition] in one volume, nevertheless, this work contains greater detail, as well as considerable additional material, with no loss of scale, this being achieved by printing on both sides of the paper, using narrower margins, and including a single index. Some revisions and improvements were made; endpaper keys show which parts of the world are covered by which plates; an international glossary gives the English equivalents of common name-words. Some discoveries by satellite surveys were included.&quot;

===Fourth generation===
The 10th or &quot;Millennium&quot; edition (1999) of the 1967 Comprehensive Edition is in effect the first representative of the fourth generation. In contrast to its predecessors, it is completely produced by means of computer-cartography: &quot;The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World&quot;, published by Times Books in London (124 leaves of maps). Contents are slightly different in scale, or in arrangement.

==== 10th edition (1999) ====
According to the publisher, this &quot;was the first entirely new edition of the atlas since the Mid-Century Edition and also the first to be produced from digital data.&quot;

==== 11th edition (2003) ====
This edition was also offered, bound in half-leather, by the Folio Society.

==== 12th edition (2007) ====
Changes to previous editions include &quot;an estimated 20,000 mapping updates including 3,500 changes to names, a brand new map of Alaska and NW Canada, abandoned settlements featured for the first time, new satellite images of the continents, revision of all national and socio-economic statistics and new coverage on Biodiversity and the Environment ... The division of Serbia and Montenegro into separate countries. The new national capital of Myanmar called Nay Pyi Taw, a joint capital with Yangon (Rangoon). Secession of St-Barthelemy and St-Martin from Guadeloupe. New World Heritage Sites. Opening of the 1118 km Golmud to Lhasa railway in China, the highest railway in the world. Opening of the 32.5 km cross sea Donghai bridge, in China, linking Shanghai to the deepwater port on Xiaoyang Shan island.&quot;

A Luxury Edition was also offered from 2008, bound by Book Works Studio in London.

==== 13th edition (2011) ====

The map of Greenland depicted 15% less ice cover than in the 1999 edition. A number of glaciologists and climate scientists contested the claim. Researchers from the Scott Polar Research Institute wrote: &quot;A sizable portion of the area mapped as ice-free in the Atlas is clearly still ice-covered. There is to our knowledge no support for this claim in the published scientific literature. It&#x27;s a really bad mapping error.&quot; The publishers accepted that &quot;the map did not meet the usual high standards of accuracy and reliability that &quot;The Times Atlas of the World&quot; strives to uphold&quot; and designed a new map that is now included as an insert in the atlas; it is also available for free download.

==== 14th edition (2014) ====
Changes to the new edition include &quot;5000 place name changes, most notably in Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Spain. Updated national parks and conserved areas including the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA), the largest conservation zone in the world. Addition of over 50 major waterfalls around the world.&quot; Geopolitical changes include &quot;Realignment of a section of the international boundary between Burkina Faso and Niger resulting from the International Court of Justice decision. New administrative structures in Burkina Faso, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Kenya and Madagascar, and the addition of the long proposed new Indian state of Telangana. Updated population of Brazilian towns from new census information. Disputed boundary around Crimea.&quot;

New features include &quot;New maps of the sub-ice features in the Antarctic and Arctic Ocean. Physical maps of all the continents showing land features which offer a useful counterpoint to political mapping. Illustrated articles on Biodiversity and Climate Change. The Power of Maps – this new section illustrates the influence maps have had on all our lives.&quot;

==== 15th edition (2018) ====
==== 16th edition (2023) ====
New features include :&lt;br&gt;
• New country names for Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and North Macedonia (previously the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)&lt;br&gt;
• More than 8000 place name changes with names comprehensively updated in Kazakhstan and Ukraine&lt;br&gt;
• Addition of Māori names in New Zealand and restored indigenous names in Australia, the most notable being the renaming of Fraser Island in Queensland to its Butchulla name K&#x27;gari&lt;br&gt;
• Administrative boundary updates in Ethiopia, Mali, and Kazakhstan&lt;br&gt;
• Added road, railway and airport infrastructure across the globe including the 4km-long Dardanelles Bridge (Turkey), the Fehmarn Belt road/rail tunnel alignment (Germany/Denmark) and the Sandoy Tunnel (Faroe Islands)

<text>Joseph Robert Theismann (; born September 9, 1949) is an American former professional football player, sports commentator, corporate speaker, and restaurateur. He rose to fame playing quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) and Canadian Football League (CFL). Theismann spent 12 seasons with the Washington Redskins, where he was a two-time Pro Bowler and helped the team to consecutive Super Bowl appearances, winning Super Bowl XVII over the Miami Dolphins and losing Super Bowl XVIII to the Los Angeles Raiders. He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

In the Redskins&#x27; 11th game of the 1985 NFL season, he suffered a gruesome and catastrophic fracture to his right leg that ended his career. Theismann worked as a sportscaster and an analyst on pro football broadcasts with ESPN for nearly 20 years. He primarily partnered with Mike Patrick, for the network&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; package and for one season of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; with Mike Tirico and Tony Kornheiser. Theismann also worked as a color analyst on NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; package with play-by-play voice Bob Papa and Matt Millen. Theismann also co-hosts the network&#x27;s weekly show &quot;Playbook.&quot; Since 2011, he has worked on the Washington Commanders preseason television broadcast team. Additionally, he works on the NFL Network on a variety of programs, primarily as an analyst.

== Early life ==
Theismann was born to Austrian Joseph John Theismann who &quot;ran a gas station and worked in his brother&#x27;s liquor store.&quot; His Hungarian mother, Olga Tóbiás, worked for Johnson &amp; Johnson until her retirement. Theismann was raised in South River, New Jersey, and attended South River High School, where he lettered in baseball, basketball, and football.

He was a high school teammate of Drew Pearson. Theismann accepted a college football scholarship to attend the University of Notre Dame, where he lived in Zahm Hall.

== College career ==
At Notre Dame, Theismann became the starting quarterback in his sophomore year, after Terry Hanratty was injured late in the season.

In the three remaining games in the regular season, he led the Irish to two wins and a tie. In 1969, Theismann led the Irish to a number five ranking, but lost to the University of Texas in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, 21–17. The next year, the Irish had a 10–1 record, a number two ranking, and won against Texas in the 1971 Cotton Bowl Classic, 24–11.

That year, Theismann was an All-American and an Academic All-American, and was in contention for the Heisman Trophy but he finished second to Jim Plunkett of Stanford University. Theismann, whose last name was actually pronounced THEES-mann, later recalled that Notre Dame publicity man Roger Valdiserri who insisted that he change the pronunciation of his name to rhyme with &quot;Heisman&quot;, although in the process learned from his grandmother that the original pronunciation of his last name was TICE-mann.

Theismann set school records for passing yards in a season (2,429) and touchdowns in a season (16). He also set a school record for passing yards in a game (526) and completions in a game (33) while playing against the University of Southern California in a torrential downpour in 1970, which the Irish lost 38–28. As a starting quarterback, Theismann compiled a 20–3–2 record while throwing for 4,411 yards and 31 touchdowns. His 4,411 passing yards rank fifth on Notre Dame&#x27;s career passing list.

Theismann was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003. He was the eighth Notre Dame quarterback enshrined into the hall, joining former Heisman Trophy winners Angelo Bertelli, John Lujack, and Paul Hornung.

== Professional career ==

=== Toronto Argonauts ===
Theismann was selected 99th overall in the fourth round of the 1971 NFL draft by the Miami Dolphins and in the 39th round of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft by the Minnesota Twins. After prolonged negotiations with the Dolphins failed, Theismann elected to sign with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League for $50,000 per season.

In his rookie year, Theismann quarterbacked the Argonauts to a 10–4 record, led the league&#x27;s Eastern Conference in passing statistics and won a berth in the Grey Cup game against the Calgary Stampeders in Vancouver, British Columbia (59th Grey Cup). A fumble late in the fourth quarter by Argonaut running back Leon McQuay close to the goal line cost the Argonauts what would have been their first Grey Cup victory since 1952.

In 1971, Theismann completed 148 of 278 passes for 2,440 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 21 interceptions. His 1972 season was shortened by injury, but he completed 77 of 127 passes for 1,157 yards and ten touchdowns. During his last CFL season, 1973, he completed 157 of 274 passes for 2,496 yards and both 13 touchdowns and interceptions. He was an all-star in both 1971 and 1973.

=== Washington Redskins ===

In 1974, the Washington Redskins obtained Theismann&#x27;s rights from the Dolphins in exchange for the team&#x27;s first-round draft pick in 1976 (the Dolphins selected linebacker Larry Gordon with the pick). Theismann left the CFL and joined the Redskins, where he served as the team&#x27;s punt returner during his first season. In 1978, Theismann became the Redskins&#x27; starting quarterback, succeeding Billy Kilmer.

In 1982, Theismann led the Redskins to their first championship in 40 years against the Dolphins in Super Bowl XVII. He threw two touchdowns and, with the Redskins trailing 17–13 in the third quarter, made arguably the most important &quot;defensive&quot; play of the game – after his pass was deflected by Dolphins lineman Kim Bokamper, causing what appeared to be an interception and sure touchdown (which would have given Miami a two-score lead and effectively taken MVP running back John Riggins out of the game), Theismann himself was able to knock the ball out of Bokamper&#x27;s hands to have it result in an incompletion rather than a catch. Later on, Washington ran their way to victory. He also led the team to an appearance in Super Bowl XVIII the following year, and would go on to set several Redskins franchise records, including most career passing attempts (3,602), most career passing completions (2,044) and most career passing yards (25,206), while also throwing 160 touchdown passes, with 138 interceptions. On the ground, he rushed for 1,815 yards and 17 touchdowns. He was named NFL MVP in 1983 by four organizations. He earned the Player of the Game Award in the second of his two Pro Bowl appearances. Theismann also punted once in his career, for one yard against the Chicago Bears.

In an era when most quarterbacks had long since used variations of a double-bar facemask or &quot;cage&quot; facemasks that afforded more protection, Theismann stood out in his use of a signature one-bar face mask throughout his pro career.

However, on at least one occasion, Theismann wore a helmet with a more standard facemask. Substituting for an ineffective Billy Kilmer against the Dallas Cowboys on October 16, 1977, Theismann entered the game wearing a facemask similar to the style worn by Ken Stabler at the time.

==== Career-ending injury ====
On November 18, 1985, Theismann suffered a comminuted compound fracture of the tibia and fibula in his right leg when he was sacked by linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson. The injury took place during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the New York Giants telecast by ABC from RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.

The injury was later voted the NFL&#x27;s &quot;Most Shocking Moment in History&quot; by viewers in an ESPN poll, and the tackle was ultimately dubbed &quot;The Hit That No One Who Saw It Can Ever Forget&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

The game&#x27;s score was 7–7 in the second quarter when the Redskins attempted to run a &quot;flea-flicker&quot; play; Theismann handed the ball off to fullback John Riggins, who subsequently lateralled the ball back to the quarterback. The Giants&#x27; defense, however, was tightly focused, and they tried to blitz Theismann. As Taylor pulled Theismann down, Taylor&#x27;s knee came down and drove straight into Theismann&#x27;s lower right leg, fracturing both the tibia and the fibula as Giants linebackers Gary Reasons and Harry Carson also joined Taylor in the sack. Theismann would later describe the incident (December 22, 2005):

The pain was unbelievable, but it didn&#x27;t last more than a second or two. My leg snapped like a breadstick. I heard it clearly, it sounded like two muzzled gunshots over my left shoulder. Pow, pow! ... It was at that point, I also found out what a magnificent machine the human body is. Almost immediately, from the knee down, all the feeling was gone in my right leg. The endorphins had kicked in, and I was not in any great pain.

As Theismann was down, Taylor immediately popped to his feet and began frantically waving, before looking back and seeing Theismann sprawled on the ground. Initially, many Redskins personnel thought Taylor was taunting after the play before quickly realizing that Theismann was seriously injured, but it was later confirmed that Taylor knew immediately that something had happened and was trying to signal for help from the emergency medical technicians, something the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; announcer team of Frank Gifford, O. J. Simpson, and Joe Namath had correctly inferred from the start.

While initially only the players on the field could see the extent of the damage to Theismann&#x27;s leg, the reverse-angle instant replay provided a clearer view of what had actually happened: Theismann&#x27;s lower leg bones were broken midway between his knee and his ankle, such that his leg from his foot to his mid-shin was lying flat against the ground while the upper part of his shin up to his knee was at a 45-degree angle to the lower part of his leg. ABC&#x27;s decision to screen the reverse-angle instant replay several times despite its palpably graphic content shocked millions of viewers, with some describing it as &quot;the most horrific professional sports injury of all time&quot;; the repeated screening of this replay remains one of the most controversial in-game television production decisions in NFL history. As the replays were shown, Gifford repeatedly urged viewers at home to exercise discretion: &quot;If your stomach is weak, just don&#x27;t watch.&quot;

The compound fracture of the tibia and fibula led to insufficient bone growth during Theismann&#x27;s recovery, leaving his right leg shorter than his left. As a result, the injury ended Theismann&#x27;s career, forcing him to retire at the age of 36. While Theismann has clarified that Taylor apologized to him many times for the incident, he also stated that he never blamed Taylor, reiterating that he was merely doing his job.

Theismann&#x27;s injury was highlighted in the film &quot;The Blind Side&quot; as the reason that, after the quarterback, one of the highest paid football players is the left tackle, who protects a right-handed quarterback&#x27;s blind side. A very similar injury occurred exactly 33 years later to another Redskins quarterback, Alex Smith, on November 18, 2018, in a game against the Houston Texans when cornerback Kareem Jackson and defensive end J. J. Watt sacked Smith, a game that Theismann himself was attending. However, unlike Theismann, Smith managed to play an additional season two years later in 2020 and won the Comeback Player of the Year award before retiring in 2021.

== Broadcast and acting career ==
In 1985, Theismann helped call Super Bowl XIX for ABC alongside Frank Gifford and Don Meredith, becoming only the second player to do commentary on a Super Bowl telecast while still an active player at the time (the first was Jack Kemp when he helped call Super Bowl II for CBS). Theismann served as a color commentator on regional CBS NFL coverage in 1986 and 1987, then worked on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; telecasts from 1988 to 2005, and on their &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; coverage in 2006.

In addition to covering football, Theismann hosted the first half of the first season of &quot;American Gladiators&quot; in 1989.

On March 26, 2007, ESPN announced that Ron Jaworski would replace Theismann in the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; booth. Theismann rejected an offer to work on the network&#x27;s college football coverage. He has since done a number of Washington Redskins pre-season games on CSN. On September 16, 2009, the NFL Network announced that Theismann would analyze game films on the show &quot;Playbook&quot;, airing Thursday and Friday nights at 6 p.m. Eastern.

On January 9, 2010, Theismann and his former head coach Joe Gibbs served as color commentators, along with play-by-play man Tom Hammond, for the Saturday AFC wild card game between the New York Jets and the Cincinnati Bengals.

On September 6, 2010, NFL network announced that they added Theismann to their &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; broadcast crew alongside Bob Papa and Matt Millen. The grouping lasted one season. He also co-hosted NFL games on NBC in 2010, and co-hosted NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;No Huddle&quot; in 2011.

=== Acting appearances ===
Theismann has occasionally acted, although most appearances are as himself or as himself in a fictional context. He does have several TV and movie appearances, including &quot;B.J. and the Bear&quot; (1981), &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Man from Left Field&quot; (1993).

Theismann appeared as himself, as part of a buyer group for the fictional &quot;New York Hawks&quot; football team on the TV series &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; (2013) and on the post-Super Bowl episode &quot;&quot; of &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; (2014). His most recent acting appearances were in movies for the Hallmark Channel. In 2016&#x27;s &quot;Love on the Sidelines,&quot; he appeared as the father of an injured professional football player. In 2019&#x27;s &quot;SnowComing,&quot; he played an agent for professional athletes (in particular, a professional football player).

== Personal life ==

Theismann and his first wife, the former Shari Brown, had three children: Joseph Jr., Amy, and Patrick. The couple divorced in April 1985, seven months before Theismann&#x27;s injury in November 1985, after which Theismann began a seven-year relationship – including a brief engagement – with television personality Cathy Lee Crosby. Early in 1991, Crosby sued for $4.5 million, touching off a counter suit. The suits were settled several months later.

His second marriage, to former Miss Connecticut winner and Miss America contestant Jeanne Caruso, ended in divorce after three years in 1995. Theismann was ordered to pay nearly $1 million of marital property and $3,500 a month in alimony. In 1996, Theismann married Robin Smith. They have homes in Virginia, Tennessee, and the Florida Panhandle. In 1975 he founded Theismann&#x27;s Restaurant and Bar in Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads, Virginia, later expanding to a chain of five restaurants in the DC-Baltimore area. Now the restaurant has a single location in Alexandria, Virginia.

== Awards ==

Theismann received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Tom Landry in 1983.

Theismann was inducted into the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1997.

In 2011, Theismann was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

On September 5, 2014, Theismann was honored by the Ride of Fame as they christened a double decker sightseeing bus in Washington DC dedicated to him and his achievements.

== UFL ==
On August 19, 2010, head coach Jay Gruden of the UFL&#x27;s Florida Tuskers &quot;confirmed that Theismann introduced himself to the Tuskers as the team&#x27;s new part owner&quot;. Theismann expressed disappointment at the way he was treated during his time in the league and left the team when it was folded into the Virginia Destroyers in January 2011.

<doc id="1061151" wikidata="Q7833559" url="?curid=1061151" title="Trans-Planckian problem">
<text>In black hole physics and inflationary cosmology, the trans-Planckian problem is the problem of the appearance of quantities beyond the Planck scale, which raise doubts on the physical validity of some results in these two areas, since one expects the physical laws to suffer radical modifications beyond the Planck scale.

In black hole physics, the original derivation of Hawking radiation involved field modes that, near the black hole horizon, have arbitrarily high frequencies—in particular, higher than the inverse Planck time, although these do not appear in the final results. A number of different alternative derivations have been proposed in order to overcome this problem.

The trans-Planckian problem can be conveniently considered in the framework of sonic black holes, condensed matter systems which can be described in a similar way as real black holes. In these systems, the analogue of the Planck scale is the interatomic scale, where the continuum description loses its validity. One can study whether in these systems the analogous process to Hawking radiation still occurs despite the short-scale cutoff represented by the interatomic distance.

The trans-Planckian problem also appears in inflationary cosmology. The cosmological scales that we nowadays observe correspond to length scales smaller than the Planck length at the onset of inflation.

== Trans-Planckian problem in Hawking radiation ==
The trans-Planckian problem is the issue that Hawking&#x27;s original calculation includes quantum particles where the wavelength becomes shorter than the Planck length near the black hole&#x27;s horizon. This is due to the peculiar behavior there, where time stops as measured from far away. A particle emitted from a black hole with a frequency, if traced back to the horizon, must have had an infinite frequency, and therefore a trans-Planckian wavelength.

The Unruh effect and the Hawking effect both talk about field modes in the superficially stationary spacetime that change frequency relative to other coordinates which are regular across the horizon. This is necessarily so, since to stay outside a horizon requires acceleration which constantly Doppler shifts the modes.

An outgoing Hawking radiated photon, if the mode is traced back in time, has a frequency which diverges from that which it has at great distance, as it gets closer to the horizon, which requires the wavelength of the photon to &quot;scrunch up&quot; infinitely at the horizon of the black hole. In a maximally extended external Schwarzschild solution, that photon&#x27;s frequency stays regular only if the mode is extended back into the past region where no observer can go. That region seems to be unobservable and is physically suspect, so Hawking used a black hole solution without a past region which forms at a finite time in the past. In that case, the source of all the outgoing photons can be identified: a microscopic point right at the moment that the black hole first formed.
The quantum fluctuations at that tiny point, in Hawking&#x27;s original calculation, contain all the outgoing radiation. The modes that eventually contain the outgoing radiation at long times are redshifted by such a huge amount by their long sojourn next to the event horizon, that they start off as modes with a wavelength much shorter than the Planck length. Since the laws of physics at such short distances are unknown, some find Hawking&#x27;s original calculation unconvincing.

The trans-Planckian problem is nowadays mostly considered a mathematical artifact of horizon calculations. The same effect occurs for regular matter falling onto a white hole solution. Matter which falls on the white hole accumulates on it, but has no future region into which it can go. Tracing the future of this matter, it is compressed onto the final singular endpoint of the white hole evolution, into a trans-Planckian region. The reason for these types of divergences is that modes which end at the horizon from the point of view of outside coordinates are singular in frequency there. The only way to determine what happens classically is to extend in some other coordinates that cross the horizon.

There exist alternative physical pictures which give the Hawking radiation in which the trans-Planckian problem is addressed. The key point is that similar trans-Planckian problems occur when the modes occupied with Unruh radiation are traced back in time. In the Unruh effect, the magnitude of the temperature can be calculated from ordinary Minkowski field theory, and is not controversial.

<doc id="1061157" wikidata="Q4118865" url="?curid=1061157" title="Dual-coding theory">
<text>Dual-coding theory is a theory of cognition that suggests that the mind processes information along two different channels; verbal and nonverbal. It was hypothesized by Allan Paivio of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. In developing this theory, Paivio used the idea that the formation of mental imagery aids learning through the picture superiority effect.

According to Paivio, there are two ways a person could expand on learned material: verbal associations and imagery. Dual-coding theory postulates that both sensory imagery and verbal information is used to represent information. Imagery and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels in the human mind, creating separate representations for information processed in each channel. The mental codes corresponding to these representations are used to organize incoming information that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use. Both imagery and verbal codes can be used when recalling information. For example, say a person has stored the stimulus concept &quot;dog&quot; as both the word &#x27;dog&#x27; and as the image (appearance, sound, smell, and other sensory information) of a dog. When asked to recall the stimulus, the person can retrieve either the word or the image individually, or both simultaneously. If the word is recalled, the image of the dog is not lost and can still be retrieved at a later point in time. The ability to code a stimulus two different ways increases the chance of remembering that item compared to if the stimulus was only coded one way.

There has been controversy to the limitations of the dual-coding theory. Dual-coding theory does not take into account the possibility of cognition being mediated by something other than words and images. Not enough research has been done to determine if words and images are the only way we remember items, and the theory would not hold true if another form of codes were discovered. Another limitation of the dual-coding theory is that it is only valid for tests on which people are asked to focus on identifying how concepts are related. If associations between a word and an image cannot be formed, it is much harder to remember and recall the word at a later point in time. While this limits the effectiveness of the dual-coding theory, it is still valid over a wide range of circumstances and can be used to improve memory.

==Types of codes==
Analogue codes are used to mentally represent images. Analogue codes retain the main perceptual features of whatever is being represented, so the images we form in our minds are highly similar to the physical stimuli. They are a near-exact representation of the physical stimuli we observe in our environment, such as trees and rivers.

Symbolic codes are used to form mental representations of words. They represent something conceptually, and sometimes, arbitrarily, as opposed to perceptually. Similar to the way a watch may represent information in the form of numbers to display the time, symbolic codes represent information in our mind in the form of arbitrary symbols, like words and combinations of words, to represent several ideas. Each symbol (x, y, 1, 2, etc.) can arbitrarily represent something other than itself. For instance, the letter x is often used to represent more than just the concept of an x, the 24th letter of the alphabet. It can be used to represent a variable x in mathematics, or a multiplication symbol in an equation. Concepts like multiplication can be represented symbolically by an &quot;x&quot; because we arbitrarily assign it a deeper concept. Only when we use it to represent this deeper concept does the letter &quot;x&quot; carry this type of meaning.

== Support ==
===Evidence from psychological research===
Many researchers have agreed that only words and images are used in mental representation. Supporting evidence shows that memory for some verbal information is enhanced if a relevant visual is also presented or if the learner can imagine a visual image to go with the verbal information. Likewise, visual information can often be enhanced when paired with relevant verbal information, whether real-world or imagined. This theory has been applied to the use of multimedia presentations. Because multimedia presentations require both spatial and verbal working memory, individuals dual code information presented and are more likely to recall the information when tested at a later date. Moreover, studies that have been conducted on abstract and concrete words have also found that the participants remembered concrete words better than the abstract words.

Paivio found that participants when shown a rapid sequence of pictures as well as a rapid sequence of words and later asked to recall the words and pictures, in any order, were better at recalling images. Participants, however, more readily recalled the sequential order of the words, rather than the sequence of pictures. These results supported Paivio&#x27;s hypothesis that verbal information is processed differently from visual information and that verbal information was superior to visual information when sequential order was also required for the memory task. Lee Brooks conducted an experiment that provided additional support for two systems for memory. He had participants perform either a visual task, where they had to view a picture and answer questions about the picture, or a verbal task, where they listened to a sentence and were then asked to answer questions pertaining to the sentence. To respond to the questions, participants were asked to either respond verbally, visually, or manually. Through this experiment, Brooks found that interference occurred when a visual perception was mixed with manipulation of the visual task, and verbal responses interfere with a task involving a verbal statement to be manually manipulated. This supported the idea of two codes used to mentally represent information.

Working memory as proposed by Alan Baddeley includes a two-part processing system with a visuospatial sketchpad and a phonological loop which essentially maps to Paivio&#x27;s theory.

Dual-coding theories complement a dual-route theory of reading. When people read written information, dual-route theory contends that the readers access orthographic and phonological information to recognize words in the writing.

Paivio&#x27;s work has implications for literacy, visual mnemonics, idea generation, HPT, human factors, interface design, as well as the development of educational materials among others. It also has implications for, and counterparts in, cognitive sciences and computational cognitive modeling (in the form of dual process cognitive models and so on). It also has had implications for cognitive robotics.

===Cognitive neuroscience support===
Two different methods have been used to identify the regions involved in visual perception and visual imagery. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure cerebral blood flow, which allows researchers to identify the amount of glucose and oxygen being consumed by a specific part of the brain, with an increase in blood flow providing a measure of brain activity. Second, an event-related potential (ERP) can be used to show the amount of electrical brain activity that is occurring due to a particular stimulus. Researchers have used both methods to determine which areas of the brain are active with different stimuli, and results have supported the dual-coding theory. Other research has been done with positron emission tomography (PET) scans and fMRI to show that participants had improved memory for spoken words and sentences when paired with an image, imagined or real. Those participants also showed an increase in brain activation that processes abstract words not easily paired with an image.

==Alternative theory==
Dual-coding theory is not accepted by everyone. John Anderson and Gordon Bower proposed an alternative method – the propositional theory – of how knowledge is mentally represented. The propositional theory claims that mental representations are stored as propositions rather than as images. Here, proposition is defined as the meaning that underlies the relationship between concepts. The propositional theory is able to explain the basic concept of an idea without needing images or verbal information. It is able to take the complex and break it down more into the differing components of the idea or concept. This theory states that images occur as a result of other cognitive processes because knowledge is not represented in the form of images, words, or symbols. This theory is also related to A Natural Deduction Systems model. This type of model allows for both feed forward and its reverse.

The common coding theory has also been proposed as an alternative to dual coding theory. The common coding theory looks at how things we see and hear are connected to our motor actions. It claims that there is a common code that is shared between perceiving something and the respective motor action.

<doc id="1061165" wikidata="Q489757" url="?curid=1061165" title="Switching barriers">
<text>Switching barriers or switching costs are terms used in microeconomics, strategic management, and marketing. They may be defined as the disadvantages or expenses consumers feel they experience, along with the economic and psychological costs of switching from one alternative to another. For example, when telephone service providers also offer Internet access as a package deal they are adding value to their service. A barrier to switching is then formed as swapping internet services providers is a time consuming effort.

Switching cost or switching barriers are the expenses or cost that a consumer incurs due to the result of changing brand, suppliers, or products. Although most common switching cost is in monetary in nature, there are also psychological, effort based, and time based switching costs.

There are a range of different switching costs that fall under three main categories: procedural switching barriers, financial switching barriers, and relational switching barriers. Procedural switching barriers refer to the time and resources associated with changing to a new provider; financial switching barriers refer to the loss of financially measurable resources; and relational switching barriers look at the emotional inconvenience from the breaking of bonds and loss of identity.

==Types of switching barriers==

===Procedural switching barriers===
Procedural switching barriers emerge from the buyer’s decision-making process and the execution of their decision. Procedural switching barriers consist of: economic risk, learning, and setup costs, evaluation, this type of switching cost primarily involves the expenditure of time and effort. There are a number of switching costs or facets that fall under procedural switching barriers. Uncertainty costs refer to the perceived likelihood of acquiring a lesser performance and quality when switching. They have the potential to prevent a customer from switching. Pre-switching search and evaluation costs refer to the time and effort costs associated with the search and evaluations required to make a switching decision. Post-switching behavioural and cognitive costs envision the time and effort needed to become familiar with a new service routine when switching occurs. Setup costs refer to the time and effort costs related to the process of establishing a new product for initial use or forming a relationship with a new provider.

===Financial switching barriers===
Financial switching barriers involve the loss of financially measurable resources. There are two facets of financial switching barriers. Sunk costs are the considerations of costs and investments already incurred in initiating and maintaining relationships. Lost performance costs refer to the perceived liberties and benefits lost as a result of switching. Large lines of credit also act as financial switching barriers when customer lose the offer of large trade credit from incumbent or existing supplier.

===Relational switching barriers===
Relational switching barriers include the psychological or emotional discomfort caused by terminating a relationship and the breaking of bonds, along with the time and effort involved in and forming a new relationship. There are two facets of relational switching barriers. Brand relationship loss costs are the losses associated with severing the bonds of identification that have been developed alongside the brand with which a customer has associated. These bonds are lost when switching providers. Personal relationship loss costs are the losses and discomfort associated with switching to a provider that a consumer is not familiar with, as familiarity creates comfort for the consumer.

===Collective switching barriers===
Collective switching costs are a unique macro form of switching barriers, appearing when the market presents collective externalities towards a service or product, and represents the combined switching costs of all entities in the market. These costs affect the competition by improving incumbents and withholding new entrants into the market, who must overcome individual and collective switching costs to advance in the market. In the presence of the product/ service externalities, participation in the dominant product or service provides the most value, while at the same time, it increases the value of the product or service. As a group, entities face collective switching costs that surpass the sum of the individual costs, because unless a coordinated desertion takes place, any individual deserter finds themselves cut out of the collective use of the product / service and its benefits.

<doc id="1061167" wikidata="Q1370860" url="?curid=1061167" title="Verse drama and dramatic verse">
<text>Verse drama is any drama written significantly in verse (that is: with line endings) to be performed by an actor before an audience. Although verse drama does not need to be &quot;primarily&quot; in verse to be considered verse drama, significant portions of the play should be in verse to qualify.

For a very long period, verse drama was the dominant form of drama in Europe (and was also important in non-European cultures). Greek tragedy and Racine&#x27;s plays are written in verse, as is almost all of William Shakespeare&#x27;s, Ben Jonson&#x27;s and John Fletcher&#x27;s drama, and other works like Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s early plays. In most of Europe, verse drama has remained a prominent art form, while at least popularly, it has been tied almost exclusively to Shakespeare in the English tradition. In the English language, verse has continued.

In the new millennium, there has been a resurgence in interest in the form of verse drama. Some of them came in blank verse or iambic pentameter and endeavour to be in conversation with Shakespeare&#x27;s writing styles. &quot;King Charles III&quot; by Mike Bartlett, written in iambic pentameter, played on the West End and Broadway, as well as being filmed with the original cast for the BBC. Likewise, &quot;La Bete&quot; by David Hirson, which endeavours to recreate Moliere&#x27;s farces in rhyming couplets, enjoyed several prominent productions on both sides of the Atlantic. David Ives, known best for his short, absurdist work, has turned to &quot;transladaptation&quot; (his word) in his later years: translating and updating French farces, such as &quot;The School for Lies&quot; and &quot;The Metromaniacs&quot;, both of which premiered in New York City. With the renewed interest in verse drama, theatre companies are looking for &quot;new Shakespeare&quot; plays to produce. In 2017, the American Shakespeare Center founded Shakespeare&#x27;s New Contemporaries (SNC), which solicits new plays in conversation with Shakespeare&#x27;s canon. This was partially in response to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival commissioning &quot;modern English&quot; versions of Shakespeare plays. SNC has been on hold since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the twenty-first century also saw theatre practitioners using verse and hybrid forms in a much wider selection of dramatic texts and theatrical performances and forms than those inspired by Shakespeare. A transnational researcher, Kasia Lech, showed that contemporary practices reach for verse to test the boundaries of verse drama and its traditions in Western theatre, including English-language theatre but also Polish, Spanish, and Russian. Lech argues that verse is particularly relevant for contemporary theatre practice because the dialogical relationship between its rhythmic and lexical levels speaks to the globalized world&#x27;s pluralistic nature. Lech discusses how artists such as Polish Radosław Rychcik and Spanish-British Teatro Inverso use verse in multilingual contexts &quot;as a performative tool to engage with and reflect on interlingual processes as a socio-political force and as a platform for dramaturgies of foreignness.&quot; Nigerian Inua Ellams explores his identity that escapes geographical, national, and temporal boundaries. Russian Olga Shilyaeva in her 2018 &quot;28 дней. Трагедия менструального цикла&quot; (&quot;28 Days. The tragedy of a menstrual cycle&quot;) uses verse to talk about experience of menstruation. Irish Stefanie Preissner in her &quot;Our Father&quot; (2011) and &quot;Solpadeine Is My Boyfriend&quot; (2012) plays with autobiography and her multiple identities &quot;as the character she performs, as the performer, the writer, and a voice of a young generation of Ireland facing the drastic political, social, and personal changes and desperately looking for predictability.&quot;

==Dramatic verse==
Dramatic verse occurs in a dramatic work, such as a play, composed in poetic form. The tradition of dramatic verse extends at least as far back as ancient Greece.

The English Renaissance saw the height of dramatic verse in the English-speaking world, with playwrights including Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare developing new techniques, both for dramatic structure and poetic form. Though a few plays, for example &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, feature extended passages of rhymed verse, the majority of dramatic verse is composed as blank verse; there are also passages of prose.

Dramatic verse began to decline in popularity in the nineteenth century, when the prosaic and conversational styles of playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen became more prevalent, and were adapted in English by George Bernard Shaw. Verse drama did have a role in the development of Irish theatre.

==Closet drama==

An important trend from around 1800 was the closet drama: a verse drama intended to be read from the page, rather than performed. Byron and Shelley, as well as a host of lesser figures, devoted much time to the closet drama, in a signal that the verse tragedy was already in a state of obsolescence. That is, while poets of the eighteenth century could write so-so poetic dramas, the public taste for new examples was already moving away by the start of the nineteenth century, and there was little commercial appeal in staging them.

Instead, opera would take up verse drama, as something to be sung: it is still the case that a verse libretto can be successful. Verse drama as such, however, in becoming closet drama, became simply a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theatre and performance.

According to Robertson Davies in &quot;A Voice From the Attic&quot;, closet drama is &quot;Dreariest of literature, most second hand and fusty of experience!&quot; But indeed a great deal of it was written in Victorian times, and afterwards, to the extent that it became a more popular long form at least than the faded epic. Prolific in the form were, for example, Michael Field and Gordon Bottomley.

==Dramatic poetry in general==
Dramatic poetry is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation.

The major types of dramatic poetry are those already discussed, to be found in plays written for the theatre, and libretti. There are further dramatic verse forms: these include dramatic monologues, such as those written by Robert Browning and Alfred Tennyson and Shakespeare.

<doc id="1061169" wikidata="Q2680633" url="?curid=1061169" title="Great Cheverell">
<text>Great Cheverell is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, south of Devizes. In some sources the Latinized name of Cheverell Magna is used, especially when referring to the ecclesiastical parish.

The parish includes Great Cheverell Hill, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest consisting of unimproved species-rich chalk grassland on the northern edge of Salisbury Plain.

==History==
A large settlement of 111 households was recorded at &quot;Chevrel&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. There were 73 taxpayers in 1377. Population of the parish peaked around the time of the 1841 census, which recorded 295; then fell as agricultural employment decreased, reaching 174 at the 1951 census. Subsequent increases reflect housebuilding and employment at HM Prison Erlestoke.

Two manors, Cheverell Burnell and Cheverell Hales, came into the ownership of the Hungerford family in the 15th century and were given as endowments to Heytesbury almshouse until 1863, when much of the parish was acquired by Simon Watson Taylor as an addition to the Erlestoke estate bought by his father, George Watson-Taylor. After the son&#x27;s death in 1902 the holdings were divided and sold.

Small streams meet in the northeast corner of the parish to form a tributary of the Semington Brook. A water-powered corn mill was recorded here in 1449; in the 16th and 17th centuries the mill was used for fulling. Edge-tools were made here in the early 19th century, and later a flour mill and an iron mill were in operation. A three-storey 19th century mill building is still standing.

The Manor House, next to the church, dates from c. 1690 with enlargement and alteration in the 18th century. Southwest of the house is a Grade II* listed game larder and gazebo of similar date. Glebe House, a former farmhouse north of the church, is from the late 17th century and early 18th.

The Stert and Westbury Railway was built through the parish by the Great Western Railway Company in 1900, providing routes from London to Weymouth or Taunton. There was a station called Lavington, just beyond the east boundary of the parish, about one mile by road from Great Cheverell village. The line remains open but the station was closed in 1967 and no local stations remain; the nearest are Pewsey and Westbury.

To the south the parish extends onto higher ground at Cheverell Down, where the southernmost part has been part of the Imber Range military training area since 1933.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of St Peter is faced with limestone ashlar except for the oldest part, the chancel of malmstone and flint, which is probably from the 11th century. The nave and west tower are from the 14th century; in the 15th the south porch was added and the tower was raised, and gained an octagonal stair-tower. Restoration in 1868 by W.H. Woodman of Reading included re-roofing of the chancel, rebuilding of the chancel arch and addition of a north vestry. The octagonal font is 13th century.

The tower carries six bells: one of c. 1500 and three from the 18th century.

The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1962. Today the parish is part of the benefice of the Lavingtons, Cheverells &amp; Easterton. The parish registers, now held at the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre, cover the years 1653-1987 (baptisms), 1654-1994 (marriages), and 1654-1987 (burials).

== Chapels ==
A Baptist chapel was built on the High Street in 1837. Known as Little Zoar, it was used until 1907 when it became the Parish Room, continuing in the same role today as the Village Hall. A new chapel was built in red brick and stone in 1911, a short distance to the east; it was in use in 1973 but is now a private residence.

==Schools==
Under the Will of J. Townsend, a charity school was established at Great Cheverell in 1725 which provided for six poor children of the parish to be taught reading and the principles of the Church of England, free of charge. By 1834, the school also had about another forty &quot;pay-scholars&quot;, for whom a charge was made.

A new two-room school for 50-60 pupils was built in 1844 on a High Street plot provided by the rector, R. M. Atkinson, with assistance from the Townsend charity for running costs. This became a National School in 1845, a Board school in 1876 and a Church of England school in 1903. Attendance fell to 35 in 1955 but by 1973 had risen to 51.

A larger school, now called Holy Trinity CE Primary Academy, was opened on the south side of the village in 1980 to serve Great Cheverell and nearby parishes including Little Cheverell, Erlestoke and Coulston.

==Local government==
Great Cheverell (or Cheverell Magna) is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions.

==Amenities==
There are playing fields with a modern pavilion, used for community functions. The village has a pub with accommodation, the &quot;Bell Inn&quot;, a late 18th-century building.

==Notable residents==
*Jane Gregory (1959–2011), Olympic dressage rider
* Sir Charles Carter Chitham (1886–1972), policeman in British India

<text>HMS &quot;Hercules&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. She was launched on 5 September 1815 at Chatham.

In 1836 she formed part of an experimental squadron, which were groups of ships sent out in the 1830s and 1840s to test new techniques of ship design, armament, building and propulsion.

On 26 December 1852 &quot;Hercules&quot; departed on her way to Hong Kong to take up duties as a hospital ship. The gold rushes had put a premium on passenger ships to Australia, so she took 756 Scots civilian passengers to South Australia and Victoria for the Highland and Island Emigration Society. Many of these were emigrating under duress from the trustees of the Boreraig, Suishnish and North Uist estates of Lord Macdonald. The voyage proved disastrous, beginning almost immediately with a horrific storm, during which the ship sought refuge at Rothesay. Soon after their second departure in early January 1853, outbreaks of smallpox and typhus were discovered, necessitating a three-month quarantine at Queenstown, County Cork. 56 people died, 17 orphaned children were returned home and many others were assigned to a dozen other ships, families being broken up in the process. The ship finally arrived in Adelaide in July 1853.

Later in 1853 &quot;Hercules&quot; was placed on harbour service. In 1854 she proceeded to Hong Kong to serve as a depot and receiving ship, and she was sold there on 22 August 1865 to be broken.

<doc id="1061208" wikidata="Q7175172" url="?curid=1061208" title="Peter Kerr, 12th Marquess of Lothian">
<text>Peter Francis Walter Kerr, 12th Marquess of Lothian, (8 September 1922 – 11 October 2004) was a British peer, politician and landowner. He was the son of Captain Andrew William Kerr by his wife, Marie Kerr. Both of his parents were male-line descendants of William Kerr, 5th Marquess of Lothian.

==Life and career==
His father, Andrew Kerr, and grandfather, Lord Walter Kerr, the son of the 7th Marquess of Lothian, were officers in the Royal Navy. He was educated at Ampleforth College and Christ Church, Oxford, and joined the Scots Guards. He succeeded his cousin, Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian, in 1940, and married a distant cousin, Antonella Newland (d. 2007), daughter of Major General Sir Foster Newland, on 30 April 1943. Lord and Lady Lothian had six children: two sons and four daughters. His wife pursued her own career as a journalist, and founded the Women of the Year Lunch. The family were mainly based at their estates in the Borders, at Newbattle Abbey and Monteviot. The 11th Marquess had left Blickling Hall in Norfolk to the National Trust. Another family house at Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire was opened to the paying public in 1952.

Lothian took part in the Wolfenden inquiry into the UK&#x27;s laws on homosexuality and prostitution from 1954. He joined the UK&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations General Assembly during the Suez crisis in 1956, and was later sent as a delegate to the Council of Europe in 1959 and the Western European Union. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the foreign secretary, Lord Home, from 1960, and was also a whip in the House of Lords. He served as a junior minister at the Ministry of Health during the short period of Lord Home&#x27;s term as prime minister in 1964. He returned to the Foreign Office with Alec Douglas-Home (then formerly Lord Home) in 1970, serving as parliamentary under-secretary for two years. He was nominated as a member of the European Parliament in 1973, when the UK joined the European Economic Community.

Lord Lothian retired from politics in 1977, after which he served as Lord Warden of the Stannaries, Keeper of the Privy Purse to the Duke of Cornwall, and Chairman of the Prince&#x27;s Council for the Duchy of Cornwall. He was appointed KCVO in 1983. He was also a member of the Royal Company of Archers, commandant of the Special Constabulary in the Scottish Borders, and a Knight of Malta.

He returned the Franciscan monastery of San Damiano, near Assisi, to the Franciscan Friars Minor in 1979, and he ceded control of Monteviot and Melbourne House to his elder and younger son, respectively, in the 1980s, to take on the restoration of Ferniehirst Castle in Roxburghshire.

==Family==
The 12th Marquess married Antonella Newland on 30 April 1943. They had five children:
*Lady Mary Marianne Anne Kerr (20 March 1944), who married Charles Freiherr von Westenholz (17 March 1945 – 9 March 2006) on 6 April 1971. They had three sons and six grandchildren.

<text>Count Kaspar Maria von Sternberg (also: &quot;Caspar Maria&quot;, &quot;Count Sternberg&quot;, , ; 6 January 1761 – 20 December 1838) was a Bohemian aristocrat, theologian, mineralogist, geognost, entomologist and botanist. He is known as the &quot;Father of Paleobotany&quot;. 

==Early life and ancestry==
Born into one of the most prominent Bohemian noble families, he was the youngest child of Count Johann Nepomuk I von Sternberg (1713-1798) and his wife, Countess Maria Anna Josefa Kolowrat-Krakowsky (1726-1790). He had two elder sisters: Countess Josefa Anna (1748-1787), Countess Maria Leopoldina (1749-1749), and two brothers: Count Johann Nepomuk II (1752-1789), a Colonel killed at Mühlbach, Transylvania and Count Joachim (1755-1808).

==Biography==
He established the Bohemian National Museum in Prague, where his collection of minerals, fossils and plant specimens formed the core collection, and he is deemed to be the founder of modern paleobotany. As of 1820, he was on friendly terms with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

Originally a student of theology, he attended the Collegium anglicum in Rome, from where he obtained a lower ordination. In his youth, he aspired to be a soldier, but soon, under the pressure of his parents and brothers, he decided to pursue an ecclesiastical career. At the age of 11, Pope Clement XIV obtained for him the position of canon in Freising and later also in Regensburg. 

Inspired by the newly founded Regensburg Botanical Society (1790), he became an avid naturalist, subsequently becoming a prominent member of the society, making contributions to its &quot;Botanisches Taschenbuch&quot; and also establishing a botanical garden in Regensburg. In 1805, during an extended stay in Paris, he met with Alexander von Humboldt and came under the influence of a number of French paleontologists and botanists. Afterwards, he relocated to an estate in Radnice, Bohemia. Here, he created a botanical garden, and conducted important paleobotanical research at recently opened coal mines located in the surrounding areas.

The botanical genus &quot;Sternbergia&quot; is named in his honor.

<text>The &quot;Lyke-Wake Dirge&quot; is a traditional English folk song and dirge listed as number 8194 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The song tells of the soul&#x27;s travel, and the hazards it faces, on its way from earth to purgatory, reminding the mourners to practise charity during lifetime. Though it is from the Christian era and features references to Christianity, much of the symbolism is thought to be of pre-Christian origin.

==The title==

The title refers to the act of watching over the dead between the death and funeral, known as a wake. &quot;Lyke&quot; is an obsolete word meaning a corpse. It is related to other extant Germanic words such as the German , the Dutch and the Norwegian , all meaning &quot;corpse&quot;. It survives in modern English in the expression &quot;lychgate&quot;, the roofed gate at the entrance to a churchyard, where, in former times, a dead body was placed before burial, and the lich, an undead monster in fantasy fiction. &quot;Lyke-wake&quot; could also be from the Norse influence on the Yorkshire dialect: the contemporary Norwegian and Swedish words for &quot;wake&quot; are still and respectively ( and / with the same meanings as previously described for &quot;lyke&quot; and &quot;wake&quot;).

==The lyrics==
The song is written in an old form of the Yorkshire dialect of Northern English. It goes:

Note: &quot;ae&quot;: one; &quot;hosen&quot;: stockings; &quot;shoon&quot;: shoes; &quot;whinnes&quot;: thorns; &quot;bane&quot;: bone; &quot;brig&quot;: bridge

The safety and comfort of the soul in faring over the hazards it faces in the afterlife, are in the old ballad made contingent on the dead person&#x27;s willingness in life to participate in charity. The poem was first collected by John Aubrey in 1686, who also recorded that it was being sung in 1616, but it is believed to be much older.

There would appear to be a lacuna in the version that Aubrey collected. Unlike the preceding and following pairs of stanzas, nothing happens at the Brig o&#x27; Dread. Richard Blakeborough, in his &quot;Wit, Character, Folklore, and Customs of the North Riding&quot;, fills this apparent gap with verses he says were in use in 1800, and which seem likely to be authentic:

Note: &quot;siller&quot;: silver; &quot;gawd&quot;: gold; &quot;footho&#x27;d&quot;: foothold

In this version, the Brig o&#x27; Dread (Bridge of Dread) is the decisive ordeal that determines whether the soul&#x27;s destination is Heaven or Hell.

This ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in &quot;Ballads Weird and Wonderful&quot; (1912) and illustrated by Vernon Hill.

The &quot;Whinny-muir&quot; of this tale also appears in The Well of the World&#x27;s End as the &quot;Muir o&#x27; Heckle-pins&quot;.

==Fire and fleet==
Some versions of the words include &quot;fire and sleet&quot; rather than &quot;fire and fleet&quot;; the latter is in Aubrey&#x27;s version of the words and in the &quot;Oxford Book of English Verse&quot;. F.W. Moorman, in his book on Yorkshire dialect poetry, explains that &quot;fleet&quot; means &quot;floor&quot; and references the OED. He also notes that the expression &quot;Aboute the fyre upon flet&quot; appears in the mediaeval poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; and explains that &quot;&quot;Fire and fleet and candle-light&quot; are a summary of the comforts of the house, which the dead person still enjoys for &quot;this ae night&quot;, and then goes out into the dark and cold.&quot;

==Versions and performances==
The poem has been recorded a number of times as a song. Arnold Bax set it for voice and piano in 1908 and made an orchestral version in 1934. Benjamin Britten set it to music as a part of his &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot; in 1943, and, in his Cantata on Old English Texts of 1952, Igor Stravinsky uses individual verses as interludes between the longer movements. English composer Geoffrey Burgon wrote a duet (This Eane Night) for two countertenors (recorded by James Bowman and Charles Brett) with words altered slightly to fit the canonical single melody, the second countertenor starting one bar behind the first. At the end of each versicle the line rises by a semitone producing an eerie and climactic ending on top D before dropping back down to the starting tone.

A version with a different tune (but with the &quot;fire and fleet&quot; version of the lyrics) was collected by the folk song collector, Hans Fried, from the singing of &quot;an old Scottish lady&quot;, Peggy Richards. The Young Tradition used this version for their a cappella recording on their 1965 debut album, using quite a primitive harmonisation, in which two of the vocal parts move in parallel fifths. The folk band Pentangle performed a version on their 1969 album &quot;Basket of Light&quot;, using the same tune as The Young Tradition, but elaborating the arrangement, and Al Stewart had a duet with Mimi Fariña in the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Choice&quot; version of his Zero She Flies album. Buffy Sainte-Marie also included this song on her 1967 album &quot;Fire &amp; Fleet &amp; Candlelight&quot;. Most later renditions of the song use the Richards-Fried melody; these include versions by Steeleye Span, the Mediaeval Baebes (titled &#x27;This Ay Nicht&#x27;) and Alasdair Roberts. The annual Spiral Dance in San Francisco has adapted the song to a neopagan context, changing the refrain to &quot;May earth receive thy soul&quot;. This version can be found on &quot;Let It Begin Now: Music from the Spiral Dance&quot;.

Maddy Prior, writing in the liner notes to the Steeleye Span retrospective &quot;Spanning the Years&quot;, drily characterises the song&#x27;s countercultural appeal, in describing one 1970s performance:
5 nights at the LA Forum with Jethro Tull. We were opening our set at the time with the Lyke Wake Dirge, a grim piece of music from Yorkshire concerning pergatory [sic] and we all dressed in dramatic mummers ribbons with tall hats. The effect was stunning. 5 gaunt figures in line across the front of the stage, lit from below casting huge shadows, intoning this insistent dirge alarmed some members of the audience whose reality was already tampered with by 1970s substances. It was most satisfying.

In the 2013 BBC radio play &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, the angel Islington (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) sang it.

In 2014 the dirge was recorded by Matt Berninger and Andrew Bird for the AMC TV series &quot;&quot; In 2016 a version was used as the theme for BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Living and the Dead&quot; supernatural horror TV series, performed by The Insects featuring Howlin&#x27; Lord.

&quot;Lyke-Wake Dirge&quot; is sometimes considered a ballad, but unlike a ballad it is lyric rather than narrative.

<text>AERO (&quot;Anthology of Electronic Revisited Originals&quot;) is a 2004 compilation album by electronic musician and composer Jean-Michel Jarre, recorded in 5.1 surround sound and released by Warner Music on 20 September 2004. The album contains three new tracks (the title track which is a rework of &quot;Je Me Souviens&quot;, from Jarre&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Métamorphoses&quot;, using the same main melody but with no vocals), and a bonus live track. All tracks are sewn together through surround-sound &quot;Scenes&quot;.

The album includes a CD and a DVD; the DVD-Video features Dolby Digital and DTS audio, whereas the CD is in stereo, mixed to give a more spacious impression than usual. Jarre chose the DVD-Video format instead of the higher-quality DVD-Audio or SACD because he claimed that DVD-Video was the most widespread format, with the generalization of home cinema setups.

The video accompanying the music on the DVD show the eyes of French actress Anne Parillaud, listening to the music for the full length of the album. Johan Carlsson of Release Magazine considered that &quot;this is a good introduction to Jarre&#x27;s music and while the new tracks aren&#x27;t much to write home about, its something for the old fans as well.&quot;

The DVD contains &quot;Scenes&quot; as separate tracks, while on the CD they are part of the track after which they follow.

<text>Sternberg () is a town in the Ludwigslust-Parchim district of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

==History==

The town of Sternberg was founded during the Ostsiedlung by duke Pribislaw I, who chartered the town with German town law in 1248. In the vicinity of the town are the remains of three earlier, Slavic settlements (near Groß Raden and Sternberger Burg within the current city limits, and near Groß Görnow). The Slavic settlement and ramparts near Groß Raden have been excavated and reconstructed and serve as a well-known open-air museum for the Slavic era.

Suzerainty over Sternberg was transferred from Pribislaw to the Prince of Mecklenburg following Pribislaw&#x27;s expulsion in 1255. Sternberg became the favorite residence of duke Heinrich II. (&quot;the Lion&quot;) in 1310. In 1492, 27 Jews were burned on the Judenberg after being charged with Eucharistic Sacrilege, a fictitious crime used in Jewish pogroms throughout medieval and renaissance Europe. On June 20, 1549, the Reformation was introduced in Mecklenburg as a result of a special council (Landtag) on the Sagsdorfer Bridge in Sternberg. In 1628, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War Albrecht von Wallenstein held council here.

==Geography==
The city is located southwest of Rostock, southeast of Wismar, and northeast of Schwerin. It is located near the Warnow River.

<text>A closet drama is a play that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader. The earliest use of the term recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is in 1813. The literary historian Henry A. Beers in 1907 considered closet drama &quot;a quite legitimate product of literary art.&quot;

== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is defined as a play created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas can be defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. However, stageability is only one aspect of such works: historically, playwrights might choose the genre of &#x27;closet&#x27; dramatic writing to avoid censorship of their works, where they had political implications. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women&#x27;s writing. Closet dramas were sometimes published (or circulated in manuscript form), to include &quot;dramatis personae&quot; and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it were being performed. This created an &quot;unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination.&quot; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being whom they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.

The academic Marta Straznicky in 2004 described the form as &quot;part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned.&quot; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: &quot;a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere&quot; through this medium.

==History==
The philosophical dialogues of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as Plato (see Socratic dialogue) were written in the form of conversations between &quot;characters&quot; and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.

Beginning with Friedrich von Schlegel, many have argued that the tragedies of Seneca the Younger in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed. Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that Seneca&#x27;s plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor Nero, a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the Middle Ages was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of Hroswitha of Gandersheim and debate poems in quasi-dramatic form.

=== Elizabethan and Stuart ===
Fulke Greville, Samuel Daniel, Elizabeth Cary, Sir William Alexander, and Mary Sidney wrote what now might be considered as closet dramas (although there were not aware of the term. and there is no evidence that considered their works part of such a genre) in the age of Shakespeare and Jonson.

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a &quot;substitute&quot; for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on &quot;propagandist aims&quot; against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. Thomas Killigrew is an example of a stage playwright who turned to this form of writing when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the English Civil War.

Following the Restoration in 1660, some authors continued to write in this form, proving in the view of some modern academics that the form &quot;served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama.&quot; John Milton&#x27;s play &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, written in 1671, is an example of early modern drama never intended for the stage.

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in verse were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models. &quot;Faust, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Faust, Part 2&quot; by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of German literature, were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Alexander Pushkin devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse tragedy on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward melodrama and comedy and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though Coleridge, Robert Browning, and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

== Early women writers in the closet drama form==
In the view of some modern academics, in the early modern period, women writers who were unable to &quot;use their voice&quot; in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama, which provided them the ability to &quot;engage in political discourse without exposing [their] views to an indiscriminate public,&quot; since they could choose to restrict her readership.

Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle-on-Tyne (1623-1673), author of fourteen folio volumes, explored writing in the closet drama form during her exile and became one of the best known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature.

Other notable women involved in this form of writing include Anne Finch, Jane Lumley, and Elizabeth Cary.

<doc id="1061249" wikidata="Q3357219" url="?curid=1061249" title="Osgoode Hall">
<text>Osgoode Hall is a landmark building in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original -storey building was started in 1829 and finished in 1832 from a design by John Ewart and William Warren Baldwin. The structure is named for William Osgoode, the first Chief Justice of Upper Canada (now the province of Ontario).

It originally served to house the regulatory body for lawyers in Ontario along with its law school, formally established as Osgoode Hall Law School in 1889, which was the only recognized professional law school for the province at the time. The original building was constructed between 1829 and 1832 in the late Georgian Palladian and Neoclassical styles. It currently houses the Ontario Court of Appeal, the Divisional Court of the Superior Court of Justice, the offices of the Law Society of Ontario and the Great Library of the Law Society.

==History==

The site at the corner of Lot Street (Queen Street West today) and College Avenue (University Avenue today) was acquired by the Law Society in 1828. At the time, the location was on the northwest edge of the city, which has since grown around the building. It was originally bounded on its north side by Osgoode Street, and on its east side by a street that would eventually be known as Chestnut Street. The former no longer exists, and the latter now stops at Armoury Street, as Nathan Phillips Square now lies to the east. The portico of Osgoode Hall&#x27;s east wing was built at the head of Toronto&#x27;s York Street to serve as a terminating vista, though it is now obscured by trees planted on the building&#x27;s lawn. Osgoode Hall, together from which the Osgoode Hall Law School (affiliated as a professional school at York University), received its name in honour of William Osgoode, which was lent in turn to the adjacent Osgoode subway station.

Between the rebellions taking place in 1837-8 until 1843, the hall was used as troop barracks. When the Law Society regained possession in 1844, an expansion was designed by Henry Bowyer Lane; the West Wing and Library were built, with two domes (later removed) over the library to connect the two wings. In 1846 the Law Society entered into an agreement with the government to house the province&#x27;s Superior Court at the hall. Today, the building is jointly owned by the Law Society and the Government of Ontario.

From 1855 to 1857, the building was refurbished and enlarged again, according to a design by the firm Cumberland and Storm, to accommodate courts with the original 1829 building becoming the east wing. From 1880 to 1891, the building was again expanded twice in order to accommodate its law school.

The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1979, and by the City of Toronto under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in 1990.

==Design==

Despite the expansions, the hall presents a unified design in the late Palladian style. The iron fence surrounding the lawns of Osgoode Hall has become a landmark in itself. Its distinctive iron gates are narrow and restrictive; it is a long-standing myth that they were designed to keep livestock out of the grounds of the hall. Despite this, an incident in the 1950s occurred in which students unsuccessfully attempted to pass a cow through one of the gates. The gates were likely due to Victorian architectural fashion, rather than wandering cattle.

Two libraries are housed within Osgoode Hall: the Great Library of the Law Society of Ontario and a smaller library for judges. The Great Library was designed by Cumberland and Storm (1857–1860) and features an ornate plaster ceiling, cork floors, an iron spiral staircase and etched glass windows. A War Memorial by Frances Loring (1887–1968), sculpted in 1928, was added to the Great Library in honour of Ontario lawyers and law students who were killed during the First World War. Behind the Great Library (and accessible through it) is the American Room, designed by Burke and Horwood in 1895, a more intimate room with a spiral staircase. The Toronto Courthouse at 361 University Avenue, directly to the north, is accessible through a connecting tunnel.

<doc id="1061253" wikidata="Q2578546" url="?curid=1061253" title="William Dannemeyer">
<text>William Edwin Dannemeyer (September 22, 1929 – July 9, 2019) was a conservative American politician, activist, and author, known for his opposition to LGBT rights. He served seven terms as U.S. Representative from the 39th Congressional District of California from 1979 to 1993.

Dannemeyer was opposed to gay rights, and promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories. After leaving office, Dannemeyer expressed extreme antisemitic views, including a claim that Jews were guilty of a plot to legalize the murder of American Christians, as part of a larger conspiracy to establish a New World Order.

==Early life==
Dannemeyer was born in Long Beach, California, to German immigrants, Charlotte Ernestine (Knapp) and Henry William Dannemeyer. He attended Trinity Lutheran School in Los Angeles and Long Beach Poly High School. An Eagle Scout, Dannemeyer received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. He entered Santa Maria Junior College in 1947 before transferring to Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Indiana. He graduated from &quot;Valpo&quot; in 1950 and earned a J.D. at Hastings College of the Law of the University of California in 1952. 

=== Korean War ===

From 1952 to 1954 he served in the United States Army in the Counter Intelligence Corps during and after the Korean War.

==Early career==
Dannemeyer began practicing law in Santa Barbara in 1955, serving concurrently as a Santa Barbara County deputy district attorney. He moved to Fullerton in 1959 to become the assistant city attorney. He was elected originally as a Democrat to the California State Assembly in 1962 and was re-elected in 1964 when he was also a member of the Electoral College, casting his vote for Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.

Instead of seeking re-election to the Assembly in 1966, he made a failed bid for a seat in the California State Senate. He then became a judge pro tempore of the municipal and superior courts from 1966–1976. In 1968, he appeared on a television show hosted by fellow future Congressman Bob Dornan to announce that he was leaving the Democratic Party to become a Republican. He would win election to the Assembly for a final term in 1976 as a Republican.

==Congress==
In November 1978, Dannemeyer was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives, and returned for six additional terms. He accumulated a strongly conservative record on the Budget, Judiciary, and Energy and Commerce Committees, supporting legislation to suppress illegal immigration, restrict telephone sex lines, and criminalize flag desecration.

He attempted to block federal funding of evolution-related exhibits at the Smithsonian Institution in 1982, and pushed for easing the separation of church and state. On fiscal issues, he advocated budget cuts for social programs, renegotiation of the national debt, tax reduction, and deregulation. He was the lead Republican sponsor of the 1985 deregulation of natural gas prices. In 1989, he was one of the successful House managers in the impeachment trial of then-Judge Walter Nixon for committing perjury in front of a grand jury. In 1990 he was one of twenty representatives to vote against the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Dannemeyer was an outspoken critic of LGBT rights, and on June 29, 1989, read a graphic description of gay sex into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; titled &quot;What Homosexuals Do&quot;. In this statement, Dannemeyer said:

... activities peculiar to homosexuality include: Rimming, or one man using his tongue to lick the rectum of another man; golden showers, having one man or men urinate on another man or men; fisting or handballing, which has one man insert his hand and/or part of his arm into another man&#x27;s rectum; and using what are euphemistically termed &quot;toys&quot; such as one man inserting dildoes, certain vegetables, or lightbulbs up another man&#x27;s rectum. Although not responsible for the original attribution, but many times on the floor of the U.S. Congress, he was fond of saying, &quot;God&#x27;s plan for man is Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.&quot;
He gained national notoriety with his proposals to contain the spread of AIDS during the 1980s, such as banning HIV-positive immigrants. He was the only prominent politician to support the LaRouche movement&#x27;s Proposition 64 in 1986. Another California ballot initiative he backed, Proposition 102, would have mandated widespread testing, tracing of sexual partners by state authorities, and a mandatory quarantine of persons with AIDS. It failed by a considerable margin. He did succeed in pushing hospitals to notify post-1977 recipients of blood transfusions that they were at risk. In 1989 he published &quot;Shadow in the Land: Homosexuality in America&quot;, attacking the gay rights movement. In 1985, Dannemeyer advocated barring persons with AIDS from working in the healthcare industry, stating that there was already &quot;a requirement that nurses who are AIDS victims not work in maternity [wards] because a person with AIDS emits a spore that has been known to cause birth defects.&quot; That stated, by 1994, he was open to the AIDS dissent movement and the views of UC Berkeley Professor Peter Duesberg and called for a full-scale Congressional investigation into the HIV = AIDS hypothesis.

In 1992, Dannemeyer did not run for reelection to the United States House of Representatives. Instead, he ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator, but lost to fellow Orange County Republican John F. Seymour.

==Post-Congressional activities==
In 1994, Dannemeyer ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator, but lost to Michael Huffington. After leaving public office, he remained a harsh critic of the Clinton administration. During his 1994 campaign for the Senate, Dannemeyer was an early proponent of the Clinton body count conspiracy theory, and sent an alleged list of victims to congressional leadership.

In September 2006, Dannemeyer sent a letter to the California Attorney General and other officials arguing that Laci Peterson had been killed by members of a Satanic cult, not by Scott Peterson.
== Antisemitic views ==
Dannemeyer expressed strongly antisemitic views. On his website, Dannemeyer claimed that it was legal to kill Christians in the United States as part of a Jewish plot to control the world. He wrote, &quot;The main goal of the Zionist Jews and their New World Order is exactly the same as it was when Jesus was on earth – to exterminate Christ – and His followers!&quot; He claimed that Congress passed such a law under the guise of honoring a prominent Hasidic rabbi while he was in office. Dannemeyer&#x27;s son Bruce insisted that his father was not an anti-Semite, as the anti-Jewish sentiments in question were the result of the influence of his father&#x27;s second wife, Lorraine Day, a known Holocaust denier. Bruce Dannemeyer commented, &quot;He had to agree with it or there would have been hell to pay in the household.&quot; The younger Dannemeyer also stated that his father&#x27;s views on homosexuality originated in his religious upbringing, stating, &quot;He had a great heart and love for people. He said some things that offended a great number of people, but he would not back down from a fight.&quot;

==Personal life==
William and Evelyn Dannemeyer married in August 1955 and had three children. Evelyn died of cancer on July 31, 1999. Dannemeyer married Lorraine Day in 2004.

== Death ==
Dannemeyer died on July 9, 2019, at the age of 89 in Thousand Palms, California. He had dementia in his later years.

<text>Ocracoke Light was built in Hyde County, on Ocracoke Island, Ocracoke, North Carolina in 1823 by Massachusetts builder Noah Porter. The lighthouse stands tall. Its diameter narrows from at the base to at its peak. The lighthouse was built to help guide ships through Ocracoke Inlet into Pamlico Sound.

In 1864, Confederate troops dismantled the fourth-order Fresnel Lens, but Union forces later restored it.

Ocracoke Light is the oldest operating light station in North Carolina and the second oldest lighthouse still standing in the state. The lighthouse was automated in 1955. During the summer months when there is a U.S. National Park Ranger on duty, visitors may access the base of the lighthouse. Access to the top of the lighthouse is not allowed due to the simple steel spiral staircase being safe only for maintenance activity.

However, this is not the original staircase; the original staircase was a wooden step spiral built into the inside of the exterior wall. This was removed during the 1950s due to excessive rotting to the boards and a lacking necessity for a substantial staircase because of the automation of the light. The wooden stairs were removed and the holes in the all-brick lighthouse were cemented closed.

The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as Ocracoke Light Station.

==Controversy==
Various claims have been made about the light, including &quot;the Ocracoke Light is the second oldest operating lighthouse in the nation,&quot; from the National Park Service. The original 1795 construction a mile away would qualify only as fifth oldest and the current 1823 tower is about twelfth oldest.

<text>Ugo Cerletti (26 September 1877 – 25 July 1963) was an Italian neurologist who discovered the method of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) used in psychiatry. Electroconvulsive therapy is a therapy in which electric current is used to provoke a seizure for a short duration. This therapy is used in an attempt to treat certain mental disorders, and may be useful when other possible treatments have not, or cannot, cure the person of their mental disorder.

==Life==
Ugo Cerletti was born in Conegliano, in the region of Veneto, Italy, on 26 September 1877. He studied Medicine at Rome and Turin, later specializing in neurology and neuropsychiatry. In his early scientific studies, Cerletti mainly focused on common issues in the fields of histology and histopathology. He demonstrated how the nervous tissue reacts to different pathogenic stimuli in its own ways, making the histopathology of nervous tissue an independent category in the study of medicine. As a student, he conducted some research under several influential people studying in the Medicinal field at that time. He studied with the most eminent neurologists of his time, first in Paris, France, with Pierre Marie and Dupré, then in Munich, Germany, with Emil Kraepelin (the &quot;father&quot; of modern scientific psychiatry) and Alois Alzheimer (the discoverer of the most common form of senile dementia, which today bears his name); and in Heidelberg, with Franz Nissl, a neuropathologist. Other large names in medicine that he studied with at the time include Sciamanna and Nissl.

After his studies, he was appointed head of the Neurobiological Institute, at the Mental Institute of Milan. He remained the director of the Neurobiological Institute of the psychiatric hospital of Mombello, in Milan from 1919 to 1924. In 1924 he was given a lecturing post in Neuropsychiatry in Bari; then, in 1928, he took over the post of Prof. Enrico Morselli, at the University of Genoa. Finally, in 1935, he became the Chair of the Department of Mental and Neurological Diseases at the University of Rome La Sapienza, where he developed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of several kinds of mental disorders, a discovery which made him world-famous. Ugo Cerletti was appointed Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Neurology at the University of Rome La Sapienza. While in Rome he became a freemason, and he served on the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite in Italy.

==Works and discovery==

The idea to use ECT in humans first came to Cerletti from watching pigs being anesthetised with electroshock before being butchered. The story goes, that on his way home he stopped at a butcher shop. The shop didn&#x27;t have the cut of meat that he wanted and he was told to walk back to the slaughter house behind the shop to have the cut made for him. At that slaughter house, the technique used for butchering cattle involved an electric shock to their heads. This would cause the cattle to go into seizures and fall down, making it easy to slit their throats. In that time period, people believed that seizures were essential in preventing schizophrenia, since many believed that those diagnosed with epilepsy were immune to the disorder. Cerletti reasoned that electric shock might be useful in humans as a treatment for schizophrenia.

Furthermore, since 1935, metrazol, a convulsant drug, and insulin, a hormone, were in wide use in many countries to treat schizophrenics, with great success. This approach was based on Nobel winner Julius Wagner-Jauregg&#x27;s research on the use of malaria-induced convulsions to treat some nervous and mental disorders, such as the general paresis of the insane, caused by neural syphilis, as well as on Ladislas J. Meduna&#x27;s theory that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic. The pharmacological convulsive treatment of Ladislas J. Meduna would eventually be largely replaced by the less cumbersome electrical method of Cerletti.

Cerletti came to the use of electroshock for therapeutic purposes in humans by way of many experiments with animals on the neuropathological consequences of repeated epileptic seizures. In Genoa, he used electric current to provoke repeatable, seizures in dogs and other animals. In these early experiments, many of the animals that were used ended up dying. In Rome, his assistant Lucio Bini realized a rudimental apparatus with a control panel that could safely be applied to humans.

Cerletti first used ECT in a human patient, a diagnosed schizophrenic with delusions, hallucinations and confusion, in April 1938, in collaboration with Lucio Bini. A series of electroshocks were able to return the patient to a normal state of mind. This experiment indicated that electric shock treatment may hold potential to improve the condition of patients diagnosed with specific diseases. Electric shock treatment quickly replaced insulin and Metrazol as the favourite form of shock treatment. Thereafter, in the succeeding years, Cerletti and his coworkers experimented with thousands of electroshocks in hundreds of animals and patients, and were able to determine its usefulness and safety in clinical practice, with several indications, such as in acute schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, major depression episodes, etc. His work was very influential, and ECT quickly spread out as a therapeutic procedure all over the world. Despite the fact that it does evoke a grand mal seizure marked by a stereotyped succession of events. Cerletti was noted to be the first person to deliver a stress treatment in which the patient did not suffer any discomfort.

As a result of his experiments, which took him from the psychiatric hospital to the abattoir and the zoologic gardens, Cerletti developed a theory that ECT caused the brain to produce vitalising substances, which he called &quot;agro-agonines&quot; (from the Greek for extreme struggle). He put his theory into practice by injecting patients with a suspension of electroshocked pig brain. Although electroshocked pig brain therapy was used by a few psychiatrists in Italy, France and Brazil it did not become as popular as ECT, which soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient. Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their work on the treatment in the 1930s.

Today, ECT is most often recommended for use as a treatment for severe depression that has not responded to other treatment. It is occasionally also used in the treatment of mania and catatonia.

==Legacy==

In his long activity as a psychiatrist and neurologist, Cerletti published 113 original papers, about the pathology of senile plaques in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, on the structure of neuroglia, the blood–brain barrier, syphilis, etc. In 1950 he received an honorary degree by the Collège de Sorbonne at the University of Paris, in addition to a long list of other awards and degrees.

Away from his medical work, Cerletti is credited with introducing the idea of white uniforms for alpine troops in order to reduce visibility during the First World War. He also invented artillery missiles with delayed-action fuses. These were used by the Italian and French armies in order to create mine fields between enemy positions.

Cerletti died in Rome on 25 July 1963.

<doc id="1061279" wikidata="Q7148135" url="?curid=1061279" title="Patronage concentration">
<text>Patronage concentration is a term used in marketing and retailing. It is the share of an individual consumer&#x27;s expenditures in an industry or retail sector that is spent at one company. It is the amount that a person spends at one company divided by the amount that a person spends at all companies in the industry.

The relation is as follows:
:formula_1.
For example, I may spend $1000 per year at fast food restaurants. If I spend $100 at Wendy&#x27;s Restaurants, then Wendy&#x27;s has (100/1000=10%) ten percent of my patronage. As long as the amount spent at one firm is less than the total amount spent at all firms in the industry, the customer will be patronizing more than one firm, and patronage concentration will be less than 100%.

The goal of many firms is to increase the patronage concentration ratio of its customers to 100%. Some firms set different patronage concentration targets for various classes of customers. This reflects the fact that some types of customers are more profitable than others.

This is very similar to market share. Whereas market share describes the percentage of all customers that patronize a company relative to the industry total, the patronage concentration ratio describes the percentage of one customer&#x27;s patronage going to a company, relative to that person&#x27;s spending in the industry. That is, market share is the aggregate or macro version of the patronage concentration ratio. Or alternatively, patronage concentration is the micro equivalent of market share.

In retailing, it has been demonstrated that store patronage is a continuum between single store loyalty and the use of several different stores. In particular, patronage concentration involves trading off economic resources against product assortment, and spatial and temporal benefits. It has been shown that patronage decisions are associated with consumer characteristics that are suggestive of heterogeneous cost–benefit tradeoffs and opportunity costs of time.

<doc id="1061300" wikidata="Q451951" url="?curid=1061300" title="Hounslow Town tube station">
<text>Hounslow Town was a London Underground station located in Hounslow, west London. It was first opened in 1883 by the District Railway, the precursor to today&#x27;s District line, on a branch line which is now disused.

The station was situated at the eastern end of Hounslow High Street, at the junction with Kingsley Road. It closed permanently in 1909. Its site is now occupied by Hounslow bus garage.

==History==

Hounslow Town station was opened by the District Railway (DR) on 1 May 1883 as the terminus of a new extension of the DR from Acton Town. The station was constructed with the intention of continuing the line south to join the tracks of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) close to Hounslow station. To facilitate this, the tracks were built at an elevated level in readiness to cross the high street via a bridge. The LSWR objected to the DR connecting to its tracks, as the new DR route to central London would compete with the LSWR&#x27;s own route to Waterloo, so the extension was never undertaken.

On 21 July 1884, a branch was constructed from just north of Hounslow Town to Hounslow Barracks station (now called Hounslow West). The branch line was constructed as single track and initially had no intermediate stations between the terminus and Osterley &amp; Spring Grove station (replaced by Osterley station in 1934).

Following its failure to extend south from Hounslow Town and because of the low passenger usage of the Hounslow stations, the DR turned its attention to the new Barracks branch and closed Hounslow Town station on 31 March 1886, A new station, Heston &amp; Hounslow (now Hounslow Central), was opened on the Barracks branch as its replacement on the following day.

On 1 March 1903, Hounslow Town was reopened. Services were divided at Osterley &amp; Spring Grove with two trains per hour running to Hounslow Town and the rest running to Hounslow Barracks. Electrification of the DR&#x27;s tracks took place between 1903 and 1905 with electric trains replacing steam locomotives on the Hounslow branch from 13 June 1905. When the branch was electrified, the track between Osterley &amp; Spring Grove and Hounslow Central was closed and a new loop was opened from Hounslow Town back to Hounslow Central. Trains would run from Osterley &amp; Spring Grove to Hounslow Town, then reverse and run to Hounslow West.

The new loop was single-tracked and had a sharp radius of which imposed a speed limit of . This method of operation was unsuccessful and short-lived. On 2 May 1909, the closed section of track between Hounslow Central and Osterley &amp; Spring Grove was reopened with a new Hounslow Town station (now named Hounslow East) about west of the loop to the old station. The old Hounslow Town station and its two loop tracks were closed permanently.

Following the closure, the station was demolished to be replaced by a bus garage for the London General Omnibus Company that opened on 14 July 1912. The current bus station and garage occupy the same site. A plaque in front of the bus garage gives a brief history of the old Underground station.

<text>Julius Wagner-Jauregg (; 7 March 1857 – 27 September 1940) was an Austrian physician, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1927, and is the first psychiatrist to have done so. His Nobel award was &quot;for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of dementia paralytica&quot;.

==Early life==

Julius Wagner-Jauregg was born Julius Wagner on 7 March 1857 in Wels, Upper Austria, the son of Adolph Johann Wagner and Ludovika Jauernigg Ranzoni. His family name was changed to &quot;Wagner von Jauregg&quot; when his father was given the title of &quot;Ritter von Jauregg&quot; (a hereditary title of nobility) in 1883 by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hence he retained the name Julius Wagner Ritter von Jauregg until 1918 when the empire was dissolved, and nobility was abolished. The family name was then contracted to &quot;Wagner-Jauregg&quot;. He attended the Schottengymnasium in Vienna before going on to study Medicine at the University of Vienna from 1874 to 1880, where he also studied with Salomon Stricker in the Institute of General and Experimental Pathology. He obtained his doctorate in 1880 with the thesis &quot;L&#x27;origine et la fonction du cœur accéléré.&quot; He left the institute in 1882.

After leaving the clinic, he conducted laboratory experiments with animals, which was practiced very little at this time. From 1883 to 1887 he worked with Maximilian Leidesdorf in the Psychiatric Clinic, although his original training was not in the pathology of the nervous system. In 1889 he succeeded the famous Richard von Krafft-Ebing at the Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Graz, and started his research on Goitre, cretinism and iodine. In 1893 he became Extraordinary Professor of Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases, and Director of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases in Vienna, as successor to Theodor Meynert. A student and assistant of Wagner-Jauregg during this time was Constantin von Economo.

Ten years later, in 1902, Wagner-Jauregg moved to the psychiatric clinic at the General Hospital and in 1911 he returned to his former post.

==Criminal inquest==
Wagner-Jauregg was angered by what he considered as the malingering of soldiers who claimed to be too mentally upset to return to the battlefield. He applied extreme electric shock therapy to these soldiers, which caused large numbers of deaths. After the end of the war, the German government opened an inquest into these activities, with the goal of prosecuting him criminally. Sigmund Freud intervened to save Wagner-Jauregg&#x27;s career. 

==Nobel prize==

The main work pursued by Wagner-Jauregg throughout his life was related to the treatment of mental disease by inducing a fever, an approach known as pyrotherapy. In 1887 he investigated the effects of febrile diseases on psychoses, making use of the streptococci that cause erysipelas and tuberculin (the latter discovered in 1890 by Robert Koch). Since these methods of treatment did not work very well, he tried in 1917 the inoculation of malaria parasites, which proved to be very successful in the case of dementia paralytica (also called general paresis of the insane), caused by neurosyphilis, at that time a terminal disease. It had been observed that some who develop high fevers would be cured of syphilis. Thus, from 1917 to the mid 1940s, malaria induced by the least aggressive parasite, Plasmodium vivax, was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of pyrotherapy). This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine, which was available at that time. This discovery earned him the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927. His main publication was a book titled &quot;Verhütung und Behandlung der progressiven Paralyse durch Impfmalaria&quot; (Prevention and treatment of progressive paralysis by malaria inoculation) in the Memorial Volume of the Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie, (1931). The technique was known as malariotherapy; however, it was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.

In 1935, he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

==Involuntary sterilizations==

Wagner-Jauregg administered thyroid and ovarian preparations to young psychotic patients who had experienced delayed puberty, which led to the development of their secondary sexual characteristics and diminished psychosis. Other patients were deemed schizophrenic because of excessive masturbation, where Wagner-Jauregg sterilized them, resulting in an &quot;improved&quot; condition.

==Retirement==
In 1928, Wagner-Jauregg retired from his post but remained active and in good health until his death on 27 September 1940. In his retirement he published nearly 80 scientific papers. Many schools, roads and hospitals are named after him in Austria.

==Nazi ideology and affiliation==

Towards his last days Wagner-Jauregg was influenced by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s German nationalism, and became an anti-Semite and sympathizer of Nazism. Documentary evidence indicates that he supported the Nazi Party shortly after the invasion of Austria in 1938 by Germany. However, a denazification commission in Austria found that his application for NSDAP membership had been refused &quot;...on grounds of race&quot;, as his first wife Balbine Frumkin was Jewish.

Wagner-Jauregg advocated a racial hygiene ideology called eugenics, influencing students such as Alexander Pilcz, who went on to author a standard handbook on racial psychiatry critical of Jews for being prone to mental illness.

He was also an advocate of forced sterilization of the mentally ill and criminal, having endorsed the concept in 1935 while a member of the Austrian Anthropological Society.

He was President of the Austrian League for Racial Regeneration and Heredity, which advocated sterilization for those of inferior genetics.

<text>Valentano is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of the province of Viterbo, in the Lazio region of central Italy. It is from the provincial capital, Viterbo.

The placename is of uncertain origin. Some identify the town with an Etruscan &quot;Verentum&quot;, others trace the name to &quot;ontano&quot;, Italian for alder, since alders cover the slopes of a nearby valley: &quot;Valle Ontano&quot; becoming &quot;Valentano&quot;.

== History ==

===Antiquity and High Middle Ages===
The town is named for the first time in a manuscript of 813 in the Farfa Register; starting in 844 a &quot;Balentanu&quot; appears in other documents of the abbey of San Salvatore on Mt. Amiata. The land was definitely inhabited in prehistoric times, and important finds in the Lake Mezzano and near Mt. Becco, Mt. Saliette, the Poggi del Mulino and Mt. Starnina seem to confirm the theories of historians, who identify the lake with the Lake of Statonia (&quot;Lacus Statoniensis&quot;) described by Seneca in his &quot;Naturales Quaestiones&quot; and by Pliny the Elder (ii.209, xiv.67 and xxxvi.168).

===The Farnese===
In the Renaissance period, the town fell under the dominion of the Farnese family: it is to them that Valentano owes its fortress (&quot;Rocca&quot;) and many of its churches.

In 1649, when the town of Castro, capital of the Duchy of Castro, was destroyed, Valentano became the natural center of the Castrense region and the custodian of its archives.

===Modern times===
In June 1944, an artillery shell exploded in the &quot;Portonaccio&quot; gate, killing seven civilians who had taken shelter in it. The gate itself is a witness to the tragedy, since one of its stones is missing, but in 2004 a plaque was placed in the Via Trento e Trieste to commemorate all local victims of World War II.

<text>The current Bodie Island Lighthouse (pronounced “body island”) is the third that has stood in this vicinity of Bodie Island on the Outer Banks in North Carolina and was built in 1872. It stands tall and is located on the Roanoke Sound side of a portion of a peninsula that is the first part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The lighthouse is just south of Nags Head, a few miles before Oregon Inlet. It was renovated from August 2009 to March 2013, and was made climbable by the public. There are 219 steps that spiral to the top. The 170-foot structure is one of only a dozen remaining tall, brick tower lighthouses in the United States — and one of the few with an original first-order Fresnel lens to cast its light.

== History ==

The preceding Bodie Island lighthouses actually stood south of Oregon Inlet on Pea Island in an area that is now under water due to the southward migration of the inlet. The first was built in 1847 and then abandoned in 1859 due to a poor foundation.
The second, built in 1859, was destroyed in 1861 by retreating Confederate troops who feared it would be used as a Union observation post during the Civil War. The third and current lighthouse, with its original first order Fresnel lens, was completed in 1872. This lighthouse was built further North and further inland on a 15-acre site. In 1932, the Bodie Island Lighthouse became automated (and the light was upgraded to an electric lamp by using oil-fueled electrical generators), and by 1953 it had been transferred into the care of the National Park Service. It remained staffed until 1940, when the lighthouse was fully automated. In 1953, the generators were disconnected and power was supplied from the commercial electric grid.

While some people (including North Carolinians not from the Outer Banks) pronounce the name with a long &quot;o&quot; sound, it is traditionally pronounced as &quot;body.&quot; Folklore would have you believe it is due to the number of dead sailors washed ashore from wrecked ships along this portion of the East Coast, which has long been known as the &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot; but that is not true. The name is actually derived from the original name of the area, which was &quot;Bodie&#x27;s Island&quot; after the Body family who once owned the land that was a separate barrier island prior to 1811 when Roanoke inlet that separated it from the Currituck Banks to the north closed. Local gift shops sell maps of the shipwrecks on the ocean floor. An impressive array of ships have been sunk due to storms, shoals, and German U-boats during World War I and World War II. This lighthouse appears in the background of the 1963–1964 Federal Duck Stamp.

After years of raising funds and postponement, work to restore the cast iron and other parts in need of work began on the lighthouse in August 2009. As of March 2010, the outside scaffolding was 100% complete while interior scaffolding was 50% completed. The restoration was stopped in spring 2011 after significant new structural integrity issues were found in many of the main support beams under the balcony. The additional repairs needed were too costly to finish in the original restoration project. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene blew out some of the newly restored lantern room glass and tore away a protective shroud covering the lantern room. Flooding caused buckling of the floors in the Bodie Island Light Station Double Keepers Quarters. Additional funding was obtained to continue the restoration, which was restarted in 2012 and completed in March 2013.
There was a re-lighting ceremony on April 18, 2013, and the lighthouse was opened for the general public to climb the following day for a fee.

<text>Limhamn () is, in an administrative sense, the southern district of Malmö Municipality in Sweden. Before 1915, Limhamn was (briefly) a town of its own.

The population of Limhamn-Bunkeflo (including suburbs) is 31,000, of which 7,000 live in the southern suburbs Tygelsjö and Bunkeflostrand, and some live in neighbourhoods that are not usually counted to Limhamn proper.

==History==

Archeological findings revealed a stoneage village from the Ertebølle culture at Limhamn. The interpretation of Limhamn&#x27;s fate in later times diverge. Limhamn is by some held to have been one of the more important fishing villages in Scania, with a population living of the sea and relatively stable in size through the centuries, but this opinion is not undisputed.

Limestone has been quarried in Limhamns kalkbrott since the early 16th century or earlier, which can be inferred from the fact that king Christian II of Denmark (1513–1523) forbade the trade on the illegal harbour Limhamn. But only since 1871 has the quarry been of industrial extent. A large cement factory, railway connection to Malmö, and a freight harbour were constructed in 1889. Soon also other industries were established.

Limhamn grew rapidly in the last decades of the 19th century: to 2,500 inhabitants in 1886, to 8,000 in 1905, when Limhamn was declared a town, and to 10,000 in 1915 when Limhamn was incorporated with the larger town of Malmö (democratically but narrowly decided by the town council). The next increase of the population started with the industrial boom after World War II, when a few blocks of flats were built. From the late 1950s a belt of new detached houses led to Limhamn physically growing together with Malmö. Locals dispute which of these new neighbourhoods really are parts of Limhamn proper, and which are to be rightfully counted with Malmö, which is why figures for Limhamn&#x27;s present-day population vary approximately in the range 20,000–24,000. Industry has mostly closed down in the late 20th century, and most people now work elsewhere in the metropolitan area that covers most of Western Scania.

==Demographics==
Today, all of Limhamn is a modestly prestigious area to live in. Very few of the houses from the pre-industrial epoch remain, but old Limhamn is characterized by owner-occupied brick houses from the late 19th and early 20th century, many of which originally were owner-build working class houses for one, two or three families. Blue-collar workers, craftsmen, and white-collar workers dominate.

==Miscellaneous topics==
During the interwar years, Hermann Göring piloted the first mail-carrying seaplane, on the route Limhamn - Warnemünde, probably while being employed at Svenska Lufttrafik. He lived for a while at Linnégatan 12 in Limhamn.

The Paleocene bird &quot;Scaniornis&quot; was described from fossil bones aged some 60 million years or more, which were found in the Limnhamn limestone; it was apparently a waterbird and might have been an early flamingo relative. At that time, the Limnhamn region was located as far south as central Germany today due to plate tectonics, and as it was warmer and somewhat more humid than today had a climate more comparable to the French Mediterranean or the Black Sea.

Skanska, the fifth largest construction company in the world, originated in Malmö/Limhamn. The Cristo Redentor statue of Rio de Janeiro, Brasil is partly built using Limhamn concrete.

<doc id="1061330" wikidata="Q246105" url="?curid=1061330" title="Zytglogge">
<text>The Zytglogge ( ; ) is a landmark medieval tower in Bern, Switzerland. Built in the early 13th century, it has served the city as a guard tower, prison, clock tower, centre of urban life and civic memorial.

Despite the many redecorations and renovations it has undergone in its 800 years of existence, the Zytglogge is one of Bern&#x27;s most recognisable symbols and the oldest monument of the city, and with its 15th-century astronomical clock, a major tourist attraction. It is a heritage site of national significance, and part of the Old City of Bern, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==

When it was built around 1218–1220, the Zytglogge served as the gate tower of Bern&#x27;s western fortifications. These were erected after the city&#x27;s first westward expansion following its &quot;de facto&quot; independence from the Empire. At that time, the Zytglogge was a squat building of only in height. When the rapid growth of the city and the further expansion of the fortifications (up to the Käfigturm) relegated the tower to second-line status at around 1270–1275, it was heightened by to overlook the surrounding houses.

Only after the city&#x27;s western defences were extended again in 1344–1346 up to the now-destroyed Christoffelturm, the Zytglogge was converted to a women&#x27;s prison, notably housing &quot;Pfaffendirnen&quot; – &quot;priests&#x27; whores&quot;, women convicted of sexual relations with clerics. At this time, the Zytglogge also received its first slanted roof.
In the great fire of 1405, the tower burnt out completely. It suffered severe structural damage that required thorough repairs, which were not complete until after the last restoration in 1983. The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was first installed above the gate in the early 15th century, probably including a simple astronomical clock and musical mechanism. This clock, together with the great bell cast in 1405, gave the Zytglogge its name, which in Bernese German means &quot;time bell&quot;.

In the late 15th century, the Zytglogge and the other Bernese gate towers were extended and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.
The Zytglogge&#x27;s exterior was repainted by Gotthard Ringgli and Kaspar Haldenstein in 1607–1610, who introduced the large clock faces that now dominate the east and west façades of the tower. The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603. In 1770–1771, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late Baroque, giving the tower its contemporary outline.

Both façades were again repainted in the Rococo style by Rudolf von Steiger in 1890. The idealising historicism of the design came to be disliked in the 20th century, and a 1929 competition produced the façade designs visible today: on the west façade, Victor Surbek&#x27;s fresco &quot;Beginning of Time&quot; and on the east façade, a reconstruction of the 1770 design by Kurt Indermühle. In 1981–1983, the Zytglogge was thoroughly renovated again and generally restored to its 1770 appearance. In the advent season and from Easter until the end of October, it is illuminated after dusk.

===Name===
The Bernese German &quot;Zytglogge&quot; translates to &quot;Zeitglocke&quot; in Standard German and to &quot;time bell&quot; in English; &#x27;Glocke&#x27; is German for &#x27;bell&#x27;, as in the related term &#x27;glockenspiel&#x27;. A &quot;time bell&quot; was one of the earliest public timekeeping devices, consisting of a clockwork connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at the full hour. Such a device was installed in the &quot;Wendelstein&quot; in Bern – the tower of the &quot;Leutkirche&quot; church which the Münster later replaced – in 1383 at the latest; it alerted the bell-ringer to ring the tower bells.

The name of &quot;Zytglogge&quot; was first recorded in 1413. Previously, the tower was referred to as the &quot;kebie&quot; (&quot;cage&quot;, i.e., prison) and after its post-1405 reconstruction, the &quot;nüwer turm&quot; (&quot;new tower&quot;).

==Exterior==

===External structure===

The Zytglogge has an overall height of , and a height of up to the roof-edge. Its rectangular floor plan measures . The wall strengths vary widely, ranging from in the west, where the tower formed part of the city walls, to in the east.

The outward appearance of the Zytglogge is determined by the 1770 renovation. Only the late Gothic cornice below the roof and the stair tower are visible artifacts of the tower&#x27;s earlier history.

The main body of the tower is divided into the two-storey plinth, whose exterior is made of alpine limestone, and the three-storey tower shaft sheathed in sandstone. The shaft&#x27;s seemingly massive corner blocks are decorative fixtures held in place by visible iron hooks. Below the roof, the cornice spans around the still-visible bases of the former corner towerlets. The two-story attic is covered by the sweeping, red-tiled, late Gothic spire, in which two spire lights are set to the West and East. They are crowned by ornamental urns with pinecone knobs reconstructed in 1983 from 18th-century drawings.

From atop the spire, the wooden pinnacle, copper-sheathed since 1930, rises an additional into the skies, crowned with a gilded knob and a weather vane displaying a cut-out coat of arms of Bern.

===Bells and bell-striker===

The tower&#x27;s two namesake bronze bells hang in the cupola at its very top.
The great hour bell, cast by Johann Reber, has remained unchanged since the tower&#x27;s reconstruction in 1405. It has a diameter of , a weight of and rings with a nominal tone of &quot;e&quot;&#x27;. The inscription on the bell reads, in Latin: &quot;In the October month of the year 1405 I was cast by Master John called Reber of Aarau. I am vessel and wax, and to all I tell the hours of the day.&quot;

When the great bell rings out every full hour, struck by a large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek personification of time, is traditionally nicknamed &quot;Hans von Thann&quot; by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure&#x27;s motions. The original wooden &quot;Chronos&quot; might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg, while the current and most recent &quot;Hans&quot; is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.

Below the hour bell hangs the smaller quarter-hour bell, also rung by a clockwork hammer. It was cast in 1887 to replace the cracked 1486 original.

===Clock faces and façade decorations===

Both principal façades, East and West, are dominated by large clockfaces. The Zytglogge&#x27;s first clockface was likely located on the plinth, but was moved up to the center of the shaft during the tower&#x27;s 15th-century reconfiguration.

The eastern clock face features an outer ring of large golden Roman numerals, on which the larger hand indicates the hour, and an inner ring on which the smaller hand indicates the minutes. The golden Sun on the hour hand is pivot-mounted so that it always faces up. 

The western clock face has similar hands, but is an integral part of Victor Surbek&#x27;s 1929 fresco &quot;Beginning of Time&quot;. The painting depicts Chronos swooping down with cape fluttering, and, below the clockface, Adam and Eve&#x27;s eviction from Paradise by an angel.

===Astronomical clock===
The dial of the Zytglogge&#x27;s astronomical clock is built in the form of an astrolabe. It is backed by a stereographically projected planisphere divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year.

Around the planisphere moves the &quot;rete&quot;, a web-like metal cutout representing the zodiac, which also features a Julian calendar dial. Above the &quot;rete&quot;, a display indicates the day of the week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the &quot;rete&quot;&#x27;s calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.

The painted frieze above the astronomical clock shows five deities from classical antiquity, each representing both a day of the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology. From left to right, they are: Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and bag for Wednesday.

====Movement====
The clock dial has been dated to either the building phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to the installation of the Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.

A clock is documented in this tower since 1405, when a new bell was installed.

==Interior==
The Zytglogge&#x27;s internal layout has changed over time to reflect the tower&#x27;s change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower. The thirteenth-century guard tower was not much more than a hollow shell of walls that was open towards the city in the east. Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted.

The rooms above the clockwork mechanism were used by the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an air raid shelter. The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion; for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed. Since 1979, the tower&#x27;s interior is empty again and only accessible in the course of guided tours.

<text>Lord&#x27;s was a London Underground station located in St John&#x27;s Wood, north-west London.

It was opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway on its Metropolitan and St John&#x27;s Wood Railway line, which is now part of the Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line. It was known by several different names throughout its history; by the time of its closure in 1939 its name was taken from the nearby Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.

==History==

The station was opened on 13 April 1868 as St. John&#x27;s Wood Road. It was on the Metropolitan and St John&#x27;s Wood Railway, the first northward branch extension from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the precursor of today&#x27;s Metropolitan line. The station was located at the junction of St. John&#x27;s Wood Road, Wellington Road and Park Road.

The original station building was cramped and unable to cope with peak demand during matches at the nearby Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground. It was demolished and reconstructed in 1924–25, to a design by the MR&#x27;s architect Charles W. Clark, with a larger building that enclosed the space above the platforms with a concrete slab to form a parking garage under the original glazed platform roof. Upon reopening, the station&#x27;s name was shortened to St. John&#x27;s Wood on 1 April 1925. It was renamed again, as Lord&#x27;s, on 11 June 1939.

In the mid-1930s the Metropolitan line was suffering congestion at the south end of its main route, where trains from its many branches shared the limited capacity between Finchley Road and Baker Street. To ease this congestion, deep-level tunnels were built between Finchley Road station and the Bakerloo line tunnels at Baker Street station. On 20 November 1939, the Metropolitan line&#x27;s service to Stanmore was transferred to the Bakerloo line and diverted to Baker Street via the new tunnels. A new Bakerloo line station named St John&#x27;s Wood was opened to replace Lord&#x27;s station. It had been the intention of the Underground&#x27;s management to close Lord&#x27;s station to normal services, but retain it for temporary use during top-class cricket matches; the advent of the Second World War led this plan to be abandoned, and the station closed permanently after the last train on 19 November 1939.

The surface building survived until the late 1960s, when it was demolished. The site is now occupied by a hotel. An emergency access point existed as of 2004 
and a stairwell went to a piece of the platform remaining at the trackside as a result of it.

<doc id="1061346" wikidata="Q27938" url="?curid=1061346" title="Allium fistulosum">
<text>Allium fistulosum, the Welsh onion, also commonly called bunching onion, long green onion, Japanese bunching onion, and spring onion, is a species of perennial plant, often considered to be a kind of scallion.

The species is very similar in taste and odor to the related common onion, &quot;Allium cepa&quot;, and hybrids between the two (tree onions) exist. &quot;A. fistulosum&quot;, however, does not develop bulbs, and its leaves and scapes are hollow (&quot;fistulosum&quot; means &quot;hollow&quot;). Larger varieties of &quot;A. fistulosum&quot;, such as the Japanese &quot;negi&quot;, resemble the leek, whilst smaller varieties resemble chives. &quot;A. fistulosum&quot; can multiply by forming perennial evergreen clumps. It is also grown in a bunch as an ornamental plant.

== Names ==
The common name &quot;Welsh onion&quot; does not refer to Wales; indeed, the plant is neither indigenous to Wales nor particularly common in Welsh cuisine (the green &quot;Allium&quot; common to Wales is the leek, &quot;A. ampeloprasum&quot;, the national vegetable of Wales). Instead, it derives from a near-obsolete botanical use of &quot;Welsh&quot; in the sense &quot;foreign, non-native&quot;, as the species is native to China, though cultivated in many places and naturalized in scattered locations throughout Eurasia and North America.

Historically, &quot;A. fistulosum&quot; was known as the cibol. In Cornwall, they are known as chibols, and in the west of Scotland as sybows.

Other names that may be applied to this plant include green onion, salad onion, and spring onion. These names are ambiguous, as they may also be used to refer to any young green onion stalk, whether grown from Welsh onions, common onions, or other similar members of the genus &quot;Allium&quot; (also see scallion).

== Culinary use ==
&quot;A. fistulosum&quot; is an ingredient in Asian cuisine, especially in East Asia and Southeast Asia. It is particularly important in China, Japan, and Korea, hence one of the English names for this plant, Japanese bunching onion.

In the West, &quot;A. fistulosum&quot; is primarily used as a scallion or salad onion, but is more widely used in other parts of the world, particularly East Asia.

=== China ===
In China, it is often used in scallion pancakes, and as a garnish for a variety of dishes. It is also mixed with meat, into shumai dumplings or pearl meatballs.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese name is &quot;negi&quot; (葱), which can also refer to other plants of the genus &quot;Allium&quot;, or more specifically &quot;naganegi&quot; (長葱), meaning &quot;long onion&quot;. Common onions were introduced to East Asia in the 19th century, but &quot;A. fistulosum&quot; remains more popular and widespread. It is used in miso soup, &quot;negimaki&quot; (beef and scallion rolls), among other dishes, and it is in wide use as a sliced garnish, such as on &quot;teriyaki&quot; or &quot;takoyaki&quot;.

=== Korea ===
In Korea, &quot;A. fistulosum&quot; along with &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;proliferum&quot; is called pa (, &quot;scallion&quot;), while common onions are called &quot;yangpa&quot; (, &quot;Western scallion&quot;). Larger varieties, looking similar to leek and sometimes referred to as &quot;Asian leek&quot;, are called daepa (, &quot;big scallion&quot;), while the thinner early variety is called silpa (, &quot;thread scallion&quot;). A similar scallion plant, &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;wakegi&quot; (now considered a synonym of &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;proliferum&quot;), is called &quot;jjokpa&quot; (). Both &quot;daepa&quot; and &quot;silpa&quot; are usually used as a spice, herb, or garnish in Korean cuisine. The white part of &quot;daepa&quot; is often used as the flavour base for various broths and infused oil, while the green part of &quot;silpa&quot; is preferred as garnish. Dishes using &quot;daepa&quot; include &quot;pa-jangajji&quot; (pickled scallions), &quot;pa-mandu&quot; (scallion dumplings), &quot;pa-sanjeok&quot; (skewered beef and scallions), and &quot;padak&quot; (scallion chicken), which is a variety of Korean fried chicken topped with shredded raw &quot;daepa&quot;. Dishes using &quot;silpa&quot; include &quot;pa-namul&quot; (seasoned scallions), &quot;pa-jangguk&quot; (scallion beef-broth soup), and &quot;pa-ganghoe&quot; (parboiled scallion rolls) where &quot;silpa&quot; is used as a ribbon that bundles other ingredients.

=== Russia ===
&quot;A. fistulosum&quot; is used in Russia in the spring for adding green leaves to salads.

=== Jamaica ===
Known as escallion, &quot;A. fistulosum&quot; is an ingredient in Jamaican cuisine, in combination with thyme, Scotch bonnet pepper, garlic, and allspice (called pimento). Recipes with escallion sometimes suggest leek as a substitute in salads. Jamaican dried spice mixtures using escallion are available commercially.

The Jamaican name is probably a variant of scallion, the term used loosely for the spring onion and various other plants in the genus &quot;Allium&quot;.

<text>Marlborough Road is a disused London Underground station in St John&#x27;s Wood, northwest London NW8, England. It opened in April 1868 on the Metropolitan &amp; St. John&#x27;s Wood Railway, the first northward extension from Baker Street of the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line). It is located at the junction of Finchley Road and Queen&#x27;s Grove.
In the mid-1930s, the Metropolitan line was suffering congestion at the south end of its main route, where trains from its many branches shared the limited capacity between Finchley Road and Baker Street. To ease this congestion, new deep-level tunnels were constructed between Finchley Road and the Bakerloo line tunnels at Baker Street; then, commencing on 20 November 1939, the Metropolitan&#x27;s services toward Stanmore were transferred to the Bakerloo line (they are now on the Jubilee line) and ran to Baker Street through the new tunnels.

Upon the transfer, Marlborough Road station was closed and replaced by St John&#x27;s Wood station, then on the Bakerloo line; it had been little used, except (owing to its close proximity to Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground) during the cricket season.

Shots of the remains of the platforms, and an outside shot of the station building and booking hall—which at the time was in use as a steak restaurant—were included in &quot;Metro-Land&quot;, a 1973 documentary presented by John Betjeman. The building housed a Chinese restaurant until 2009 and now contains a substation installed as part of the power upgrade programme to support the introduction of S stock on the Metropolitan line.

Marlborough Road itself was renamed Marlborough Place in the 1950s.

<text>The First Department () was in charge of secrecy and political security of the workplace of every enterprise or institution of the Soviet Union that dealt with any kind of technical or scientific information (plants, R&amp;D institutions, etc.) or had printing capabilities (e.g., publishing houses).

Every branch of the Central Statistical Administration and its successor the State Statistics Committee (Goskomstat) also had a First Department to control access, distribution, and publication of official economic, population, and social statistics. Copies of especially sensitive documents were numbered and labeled or stamped as secret or &quot;For official use only&quot;. In some cases, the &quot;official use&quot; version of documents mimicked the public use versions in format but provided much more detailed information.

The first departments were a part of the KGB and not subordinated to the management of the enterprise or institution. Among its functions was control of access to information considered state secret, of foreign travel, and of publications. The First Department also kept account of the usage of copying devices (xerographers, printing presses, typewriters, etc.) to prevent unsanctioned copying, including samizdat.

<doc id="1061357" wikidata="Q1949625" url="?curid=1061357" title="History of Eurasia">
<text>The history of Eurasia is the collective history of a continental area with several distinct peripheral coastal regions: Southwest Asia, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Western Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Perhaps beginning with the Steppe Route trade, the early Silk Road, the Eurasian view of history seeks establishing genetic, cultural, and linguistic links between Eurasian cultures of antiquity. Much interest in this area lies with the presumed origin of the speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language and chariot warfare in Central Eurasia.

== Prehistory ==
===Lower Paleolithic===

Fossilized remains of Homo ergaster and Homo erectus between 1.8 and 1.0 million years old have been found in Europe (Georgia (Dmanisi), Spain), Indonesia (e.g., Sangiran and Trinil), Vietnam, and China (e.g., Shaanxi). (See also:Multiregional hypothesis.) The first remains are of Olduwan culture, later of Acheulean and Clactonian culture. Finds of later fossils, such as Homo cepranensis, are local in nature, so the extent of human residence in Eurasia during 1,000,000 – 300,000 ybp remains a mystery.

=== Middle Paleolithic ===
Geologic temperature records indicate two intense ice ages dated around 650000 ybp and 450000 ybp. These would have presented any humans outside the tropics unprecedented difficulties. Indeed, fossils from this period are very few, and little can be said of human habitats in Eurasia during this period. The few finds are of Homo antecessor and Homo heidelbergensis, and Lantian Man in China.

After this, Homo neanderthalensis, with his Mousterian technology, emerged, in areas from Europe to western Asia and continued to be the dominant group of humans in Europe and the Middle East up until 40000–28000 ybp. Peking Man has also been dated to this period. During the Eemian Stage, humans probably (e.g. Wolf Cave) spread wherever their technology and skills allowed. The Sahara dried up, forming a difficult area for peoples to cross.

The birth of the first modern humans (Homo sapiens idaltu) has been dated between 200000 and 130000 ybp (see:Mitochondrial Eve, Single-origin hypothesis), that is, to the coldest phase of the Riss glaciation. Remains of Aterian culture appear in the archaeological evidence.

==== Population bottleneck ====
In the beginning of the last ice age a supervolcano erupted in Indonesia. Theory states the effects of the eruption caused global climatic changes for many years, effectively obliterating most of the earlier cultures. Y-chromosomal Adam (90000–60000 BP, dated data) was initially dated here. Neanderthals survived this abrupt change in the environment, so it&#x27;s possible for other human groups too. According to the theory humans survived in Africa, and began to resettle areas north, as the effects of the eruption slowly vanished. Upper Paleolithic revolution began after this extreme event, the earliest finds are dated c.50000 BC.

A divergence in genetical evidence occurs during the early phase of the glaciation. Descendants of female haplogroups M, N and male CT are the ones found among Eurasian peoples today.

=== Upper Paleolithic ===

The Southern Dispersal scenario postulates the arrival of anatomically modern humans to Eurasia beginning about 70,000 BC. Moving along the southern coast of Asia, they reached Maritime Southeast Asia by about 65,000 years ago. 
The establishment of population centers in Western Asia, the Indian subcontinent and in East Asia is attested by about 50,000 years ago.
The Eurasian Upper Paleolithic proper is taken after c. 45,000 years ago, with the Cro-Magnon expansion into Europe (Mousterian), and the expansion into the Mammoth steppe of Northern Asia.

==== Migrations ====
Tracing back minute differences in the genomes of modern humans by methods of genetic genealogy, can and have been used to produce models of historical migration. Though these give indications of the routes taken by ancestral humans, genetic marker dating is becoming more accurate. The earliest migrations (dated c. 75.000 BP) from the Red Sea shores have been most likely along southern coast of Asia. After this, tracking and timing genetical markers gets increasingly difficult. What is known, is that on areas, of what is now Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, genetic markers diversify (from about 60000 BC), and subsequent migrations emerge to all directions (even back to the Levant) and North Africa. From the foothills of the Zagros, big game hunting cultures developed which spread across the Eurasian steppe. Crossing the Caucasus and the Ural Mountains were the ancestors of Samoyeds and the ancestors of Uralic peoples, developing sleds, skis and canoes. Through Kazakhstan moved the ancestors of the Indigenous Americans (dated 50000–40000 BC). Eastbound (maybe through Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin went the ancestors of the northern Chinese and Koreans. It is possible that the routes taken by the Indo-European ancestors travelled across the Bosphorus. Genetic evidence suggests a number of separate migrations (1.Anatoleans 2. Tocharians, 3 Celto-Illyrians, 4.Germanic and Slav, - possibly in this order). Archaeological evidence has not been identified for a number of different groups. On historical linguistic evidence, see for example classification of Thracian. The traditional view of associating early Celts with the Hallstatt culture, and the Nordic Bronze Age with Germanic peoples. The Roman Empire spread after the first widespread use of iron outside Central Europe from the Villanovan culture area. Most likely there was trade also in these periods, e.g. with amber and salt being major products.

Influences from northern Africa via Gibraltar and Sicilia cannot be readily discounted. Many other questions remain open, too; for example, Neanderthals were still present at this time. More genetic data is being gathered by various research programs.

===Early Holocene===

As the ice age ended, major environmental changes happened, such as sea level rise (est. 120m), vegetation changes, and animals disappearing in the Holocene extinction event. At the same time Neolithic Revolution began and humans started to make pottery, began to cultivate crops and domesticated some animal species.

Neolithic cultures in Eurasia are many, and best discussed in separate articles. Some of the articles on this subject include: Natufian culture, Jōmon culture, List of Neolithic cultures of China and Mehrgarh. European sites are many, they are discussed in Prehistoric Europe. The finding of Ötzi the Iceman (dated 3300 BC) provides an important insight to Chalcolithic period in Europe. Proto-languages of various peoples have been forming in this period, though no literal evidence can (by definition) be found. Later migrations further complicate the study of migrations in this period.

==Emergence of civilizations==

Due to the similarities between Indo-European languages spoken throughout Europe, Iran, and India, it is widely believed that a group originating in the Pontic steppe in the 5th millennium BC spread both east and west, gradually making their way towards the Indian subcontinent and China in the east and western Europe in the west. These Proto-Indo-Europeans spread their languages into the Middle East, India, Europe, and to the borders of China.

Early forms of civilization in Southwest Asia began as early as the 8th millennium BC, in proto-urban centers such as Çatalhöyük. Urban civilizations began to emerge in the Chalcolithic. The earliest urban civilizations in Mesopotamia, India, and China all developed along river valleys. The Uruk period of Mesopotamia dates from about 4000 to 3100 BC and provides the earliest signs of the existence of states in the Near East. Civilizations grew along the Indus River around 3300 BC in Bronze Age India and in 1700 BE along the Yellow River in China. The valleys provided plentiful water and the enrichment of the soil due to annual floods, which made it possible to grow excess crops beyond what was needed to sustain an agricultural village. This allowed for some members of the community to engage in non-agricultural activities, such as the construction of buildings, trade, and social organization. Boats on the river provided an easy and efficient way to transport people and goods, allowing for the development of trade and facilitating central control of outlying areas. Writing likely developed independently in multiple Eurasian civilizations, including Mesopotamia (between 3400 and 3100 BC) and China (1200 BC). 

In southern Europe, the Minoan civilization of the Aegean Islands began around 3500 BC, with the complex urban civilization beginning around 2000 BC. It left behind a number of massive building complexes, sophisticated art, and writing systems. Its economy benefited from a network of trade around much of the Mediterranean. By the 2nd millennium BC, the eastern coastlines of the Mediterranean were dominated by the Hittite and Egyptian empires, competing for control over the city states in the Levant.

The Black Sea area was another cradle of European civilization. The prehistoric fortified stone settlement of Solnitsata (5500–4200 BC) is one of the oldest known towns in Europe. The Bronze Age arose in this region during the final centuries of the 4th millennium. 

The Bronze Age collapse ended the Late Bronze Age in much of Europe and the Mediterranean region, leading to the Early Iron Age. The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning in the 13th and 12th centuries BC. The cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the Egyptian Empire in Syria and Israel, the scission of long-distance trade contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BC. The gradual end of the Dark Age that ensued saw the rise of settled Neo-Hittite Aramaean kingdoms of the mid-10th century BC, and the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Phoenician expansion from the Levant beginning in the 12th century BC resulted in a &quot;world-economy&quot;. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed ca. 1200–800 BC. The Phoenicians and the Assyrians transported elements of the Late Bronze Age culture of the Near East to Iron Age Greece and Italy, but also further afield to Northwestern Africa and to Iberia, initiating the beginning of Mediterranean history now known as Classical Antiquity. They notably spread alphabetic writing, which would become the hallmark of the Mediterranean civilizations of the Iron Age, in contrast to the cuneiform writing of Assyria and the logographic system in the Far East (and later the abugida systems of India).

The Iron Age made large stands of timber essential to a nation&#x27;s success because smelting iron required so much fuel, and the pinnacles of human civilizations gradually moved as forests were destroyed. In Europe the Mediterranean region was supplanted by the German and Frankish lands. In the Middle East the main power center became Anatolia with the once dominant Mesopotamia its vassal. In China, the economical, agricultural, and industrial center moved from the northern Yellow River to the southern Yangtze, though the political center remained in the north. In part this is linked to technological developments, such as the mouldboard plough, that made life in once undeveloped areas more bearable.

In the Axial Age, China, India, and the Mediterranean formed a continuous belt of civilizations stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic and connected by the Silk Road. 

== Medieval era onward ==
The Indo-Mediterranean was the center of Afro-Eurasian connectivity in general until around 1000 AD, with Warwick Ball and William Dalrymple arguing that the Silk Road&#x27;s prominence only rose with the Pax Mongolica from the 13th century onwards, and Dalrymple further arguing that until then, the main connecting route in Eurasia was a &quot;Golden Road&quot; going through the Indian Ocean and South Asia.

The rise of Islam on Europe&#x27;s periphery, notably culminating in the 1453 fall of Constantinople, began to fuel a European self-conceptualization of being a Christendom that was isolated from the broader world. Europe came to sharply distinguish itself from Africa during this time period, though its ties to Asia were left more ambiguous.

=== Modern era ===
At the turn of the 16th century, new routes arose between Europe and Asia as part of the Age of Discovery. For example, Christopher Columbus&#x27;s 1490s voyages to the Americas aimed to traverse from Atlantic Europe to Pacific Asia by sailing westward. Though he failed, the Spanish and Portuguese empires that followed in his footsteps were to eventually create trading networks like the Manila galleon that connected a variety of Eurasian regions together (see also: Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India).

The 1869 completion of the Suez Canal furthered connectivity and led into the European &quot;New Imperialism&quot; in Asia and Africa, as it enabled direct passage through the Indo-Mediterranean rather than by travelling around Africa. At the same time, the foundations for the Japanese colonial empire in the Asia-Pacific were being laid, as Western learning and trans-Pacific contact with the United States helped Japan modernize itself. Japan&#x27;s brief rule over Southeast Asia in the mid-20th century played a significant role in removing European dominance in the region.

=== Contemporary era ===
World War II, which ended in 1945, paved the way for Asia&#x27;s decolonization from Western and Japanese rule. The Cold War of the late 20th century meant that there was then a conflict between an American-led coalition against the Soviet/communist presence that dominated much of Eurasia. The end of the Cold War in 1991 saw the emergence of several independent states from the former Soviet Union in and around the Europe-Asia boundary region.

<doc id="1061363" wikidata="Q486501" url="?curid=1061363" title="Swiss Cottage tube station (1868–1940)">
<text>Swiss Cottage is a disused London Underground station in Swiss Cottage, north-west London. It was opened in 1868 as the northern terminus of the Metropolitan and St. John&#x27;s Wood Railway (M&amp;StJWR), the first northward branch extension from Baker Street of the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line).

Subsequent to the opening of a new Swiss Cottage station, which was served initially by the Bakerloo line (1939–1979) and is now on the Jubilee line (1979–present), this Metropolitan line Swiss Cottage station was closed in 1940.

==History==

The M&amp;StJWR was a separately promoted railway partly funded and operated by the Metropolitan Railway (MR). The line north from the MR&#x27;s station at Baker Street was approved in 1864 and was to continue to a station next to the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s Finchley Road station (now Finchley Road and Frognal). Financial difficulties meant the scope of the line was reduced to a single track line and only progressed as far as Swiss Cottage, which opened with the line on 13 April 1868.

On 26 April 1868, two trains collided head-on at the station. This was the result of a signaller&#x27;s error, which caused an arriving train to be misrouted to the platform where another train stood awaiting departure. Three people were injured.

In 1873, the M&amp;StJWR was authorised to extend its railway to Kingsbury and to add a second track between Swiss Cottage and Baker Street. The first extension to West Hampstead opened on 30 June 1879 as an interim single track shuttle service from Swiss Cottage before works to Willesden Green were completed and opened on 24 November 1879. The MR took control of the M&amp;StJWR on 1 April 1882. The line was subsequently extended in stages to reach Watford, Aylesbury, Chesham and Uxbridge.

In the 1920s, the MR demolished the street-level station building on the west side of Finchley Road, and replaced it with a shopping arcade and three entrances down to the station. The structure was built to the designs of C. W. Clark.

By the mid-1930s, the Metropolitan line was suffering congestion at the south end of its main route, where trains from its many branches were struggling to share the limited capacity of its tracks between Finchley Road and Baker Street. To ease this congestion, a new section of deep-level tunnel was constructed between Finchley Road station and the Bakerloo line tunnels at Baker Street. The Metropolitan line&#x27;s Stanmore branch services were then transferred to the Bakerloo line, with effect from 20 November 1939, and diverted to run into Baker Street in the new tunnels, thus reducing the number of trains using the Metropolitan line&#x27;s tracks.

For the new deep-level route, a new Bakerloo line station named Swiss Cottage was opened adjacent to the existing Metropolitan line station. For a time, they operated as a single station (platforms 1 and 2 were for the Metropolitan line, and platforms 3 and 4 were for the Bakerloo line). This arrangement was short-lived, however, and the Metropolitan line Swiss Cottage station was closed after the last train on 17 August 1940 as a wartime economy. On 1 May 1979, the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line was transferred to the new Jubilee line.

The MR station building was demolished in the 1960s to allow the widening of Finchley Road, but the former platform area still exists in part.

== Unbuilt line to Hampstead ==
Before the line was constructed, the M&amp;StJWR received authorisation in 1865 to continue the line northwards from Finchley Road to a station at Hampstead. This appeared on some maps. The scheme was cancelled in 1870. A section of tunnel was built north of Swiss Cottage station for the Hampstead extension, most of which was used for the later extension to the north-west. A short length towards Hampstead was unused. This is still visible today when travelling on a southbound Metropolitan line service.

<text>James Paul Marsden (born September 18, 1973) is an American actor. He began his acting career guest starring in the television shows &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; (1993), &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; (1995), and &quot;Party of Five&quot; (1995). Marsden gained fame for his portrayal of Cyclops in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series (2000–2014) and for his roles in the films &quot;The Notebook&quot; (2004), &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2007), &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007), &quot;27 Dresses&quot; (2008), and &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; (2013). He portrayed John F. Kennedy in the drama film &quot;The Butler&quot; (2013) and Tom Wachowski in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film series (2020–present).

Marsden starred in the HBO science fiction series &quot;Westworld&quot; from 2016 to 2022 and in the Netflix black comedy series &quot;Dead to Me&quot; from 2019 to 2022, for which he received a nomination for a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award. He played guest roles in the sitcoms &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2011) and &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2012–2013). He starred as a fictionalized version of himself in the mockumentary series &quot;Jury Duty&quot; (2023), for which he received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award. Marsden has since starred in the Hulu thriller series &quot;Paradise&quot; (2025).

==Early life and family==
Marsden was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma, on September 18, 1973, the son of Kathleen (née Scholtz) and James Luther Marsden. His father, a food safety advisor to LexiGene Industries, and his mother, a nutritionist, divorced when he was nine years old.

He has four siblings: two younger sisters and two brothers. He attended Hefner Middle School and Putnam City North High School, in Oklahoma City, and later went on to attend Oklahoma State University, where he studied broadcast journalism. He was also a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Marsden left after one and a half years, opting instead to move to Los Angeles in order to pursue his acting career.

==Career==
===Debut and early career (1993–2003)===
Marsden got his first job in a series of episodes of &quot;The Nanny&quot; as Eddie, Margaret Sheffield&#x27;s boyfriend. He then starred in the Canadian television series &quot;Boogies Diner&quot;, which aired for one season. Following the end of that series, he guest starred on television shows such as &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; and &quot;Party of Five&quot;. He later starred in the ABC show &quot;Second Noah&quot;. He lost out to Edward Norton for a role in &quot;Primal Fear&quot; and auditioned for the lead role in &quot;54&quot;, which then went to Ryan Phillippe. He starred in the films &quot;Disturbing Behavior&quot; opposite Katie Holmes and &quot;Gossip&quot; opposite Kate Hudson. He also appeared in the television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; as one of the main cast members during the first half of season 5, where he also sang. He also starred in a 1998 episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;.

Marsden was cast as Cyclops in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films. Marsden also appeared in Bryan Singer&#x27;s &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. Singer had dropped out of the third X-Men film to direct &quot;Superman&quot; and Marsden was cast as Lois Lane&#x27;s fiancé, Richard White. Due to schedule conflicts, Marsden&#x27;s screen time in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; was reduced, stirring controversy from fans of the comics. Marsden&#x27;s portrayal of Cyclops in the films was well received and garnered him a Blockbuster Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2014 Marsden reprised his role of Cyclops in a brief cameo for &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, as did other actors from the first film including Anna Paquin and Famke Janssen.

===Breakthrough with comedy films (2004–2011)===
In 2004, Marsden co-starred with Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling, James Garner, and Gena Rowlands in the romantic drama &quot;The Notebook&quot; as Lon Hammond, Jr., the second man Allie Hamilton (McAdams) falls in love with. In 2007, Marsden played Corny Collins in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;, based on the 1988 John Waters film of the same name. In the film, he sang two songs, &quot;The Nicest Kids In Town&quot; and &quot;(It&#x27;s) Hairspray.&quot; Both &quot;Hairspray&quot; and its soundtrack were critically acclaimed. His next role was with Amy Adams in the Disney hybrid animated/live-action film &quot;Enchanted&quot;, playing Prince Edward. He sang one song as a duet with Adams at the beginning of the film and a duet with Idina Menzel that was cut from the film. &quot;Enchanted&quot; was well received critically and proved to be a commercial success, earning more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.

Following his successes in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hairspray&quot; and &quot;Enchanted&quot;, Marsden played the male lead in the 2008 romantic comedy &quot;27 Dresses&quot; opposite star Katherine Heigl, which grossed $160 million worldwide. He also starred in the teen comedy &quot;Sex Drive&quot;. Though the film was a moderate success, Marsden&#x27;s performance was heavily praised. Marsden also received a Teen Choice Awards nomination for Choice Movie Actor in a Comedy for his roles in &quot;Enchanted&quot; and &quot;27 Dresses&quot;.

In 2009, Marsden also played the male lead in the film &quot;The Box&quot;, based on the 1970 short story &quot;Button, Button&quot; by author Richard Matheson, which was earlier made into an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. He starred opposite Cameron Diaz and reunited with &quot;Superman Returns&quot; co-star Frank Langella. In 2010, Marsden was cast in the comedy &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot;, a remake of the 2007 British film of the same name, along with Chris Rock, Luke Wilson, Danny Glover, and Columbus Short.

Marsden made an appearance on &quot;Modern Family&quot; in January 2011, playing a squatter. In April, Marsden appeared as the male (live-action) lead in &quot;Hop&quot;, an Easter-themed comedy co-starring Russell Brand as the Easter Bunny. Although the film was considered a commercial success, opening at the top of the weekend box office and grossing over $100 million in the U.S. box office, &quot;Hop&quot; generally received negative reviews. Later in 2011, Marsden played the lead in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, a remake of Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s 1971 film; Marsden portrayed the character played by Dustin Hoffman in the original. &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; reunited Marsden with his &quot;Superman Returns&quot; co-star Kate Bosworth. The film received mixed reviews and ultimately ended up being a box office flop.

=== Independent films and television roles (2012–present)===

In 2012 and 2013, Marsden appeared in a recurring role in the sixth and seventh seasons of &quot;30 Rock&quot;, playing Criss Chros, the boyfriend (and later husband) of the series&#x27; main character Liz Lemon. He also appeared in several independent films, including &quot;Robot &amp; Frank&quot;, &quot;Small Apartments&quot;, &quot;Bachelorette&quot;, and &quot;As Cool as I Am&quot;. In 2013, he co-starred with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg in the action film &quot;2 Guns&quot;, which debuted at number one in its weekend release. Soon after, he starred in Lee Daniels&#x27; historical drama &quot;The Butler&quot; as President John F. Kennedy. The film, featuring an ensemble, opened at the top spot and received positive reviews. Marsden played Jack Lime,a rival reporter to Will Ferrell&#x27;s Ron Burgundy, in &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;. The following year, he reprised his role as Scott Summers for the first time in eight years in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; in a cameo. He would also star in his second Nicholas Sparks film titled &quot;The Best of Me&quot;, replacing Paul Walker in the lead role. Marsden performed as the sentient android Teddy Flood in three seasons of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Westworld&quot;.

Marsden appeared as Judy Hale&#x27;s former boyfriend and lawyer Steve Wood in the Netflix dark comedy series &quot;Dead to Me&quot;. He later starred in a separate role in the same series as Ben Wood from the second season onward. In 2020, he starred in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film and the Paramount+ television miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot;. Marsden also starred in the FX miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot; as Phil Crane. In 2021, Marsden provided the voice of Hitch Trailblazer in the Netflix animated film &quot;My Little Pony: A New Generation&quot;. Marsden reprised his role of Tom Wachowski in the 2022 sequel &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;. He also reprised the role of Edward in the sequel to &quot;Enchanted&quot;, titled &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, which was released on Disney+ in November 2022. 

In 2023, Marsden starred as himself in the hoax reality television series &quot;Jury Duty&quot;, a role which garnered him a Golden Globe nomination. The series won a 2023 Peabody Award as an Entertainment Honoree.

In 2024, Marsden was announced to return as Tom Wachowski in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;. He also starred as Jack LaLanne in &quot;Unfrosted&quot;, which was released on Netflix in May of that year.

<doc id="1061379" wikidata="Q4455145" url="?curid=1061379" title="Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality">
<text>Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality (; transliterated: Pravoslávie, samoderzhávie, naródnost&#x27;), also known as Official Nationalism, was the dominant Imperial ideological doctrine of Russian Emperor Nicholas I. The doctrine sought Imperial unity under Orthodox Christianity and the absolute authority of the Emperor, while suppressing ideas deemed destructive to that unity. It followed a broader European reactionary trend that sought to restore and defend political institutions that were overthrown in the Napoleonic Wars.

&quot;The Triad&quot; of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833, circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev, and Nikolai Gogol.

Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia&#x27;s first statewide political ideology since the 16th century, indicated the nation&#x27;s brewing transition to modernity.

==Quest for ideology==

Nicholas I emerged as the Emperor in the wake of the Decembrist revolt; subsequent investigation proved that disloyalty was deeply rooted within the noble estate—the sole foundation of the House of Romanov. His father and grandfather were killed by their own guards and statesmen in palace coups. Keen to eradicate the rebels and ensure his own physical security, Nicholas carefully studied proceedings of the Decembrists&#x27; investigation and was aware of defects in his predecessor&#x27;s government that fueled the mutiny. &quot;In one sense, the reign of Nicholas I was a protracted epilogue to the Decembrist rising.&quot;

Nicholas, acting in line with his absolutist predecessors of the Age of Enlightenment, developed a state education system and completed codification of the law. He installed a highly regulated but ultimately inefficient government system of &quot;anxious centralization&quot;, himself being the chief arbiter between rivalling statesmen. The system created by Nicolas I was unsound and ineffective since the Emperor could not personally oversee all state business and review all papers to be signed.

The Emperor found himself a prisoner of his own system, so he could only rely on his high officials in most of his day-to-day activity. Higher officials relied on officials of lower rank. In most cases government officials, even ministers, did things on their own and paid little attention to general instructions given by the Emperor in one case or another.

The autocracy was exploited by government officials (&quot;chinovniki&quot;) for their own benefit. The autocracy in fact turned out to be a cover to hide the acts made by officials at all levels. Back in those days, it was &quot;chinovniki&quot; who had real power, but not the Emperor, who was nothing more but a promulgator of laws. Nevertheless, if a certain law was not lucrative or was disadvantageous for government officials, it was not a problem to make legal obstacles to enforce such law.

Sometimes a law was simply abolished without the Emperor knowing about it, as it was usually the case with the Emperor’s acts regulating commercial activity of Saint Petersburg negotiants (&quot;kuptsy&quot;). In any case, the Emperor always got a report that everything went well and all his instructions had been implemented. But he also attributed the nobles&#x27; disloyalty to a Europe-wide conspiracy aimed at destroying ruling monarchies, religion, and morale. Russia, according to his point of view, succeeded in the Napoleonic Wars while more advanced regimes failed, saving Europe from plunging into decay and atheism.

==Forging the triad==

Sergey Uvarov, Minister of Education and President of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1818, was also a writer, a scholar and at times was considered a freethinker. Yet, with a change in domestic politics, he easily adjusted to a tightened regime. In 1833 Uvarov forged the Emperor&#x27;s program into a brief statement of ideology:

Tsar Nicholas I had remembered the Decembrist revolt for all his life. He always suspected secret societies and uprisings to be plotted around him. Such personal feelings of the Tsar had great influence on the development of Russia. In order to meet the demands of the new state of affairs under Nicholas I, the Minister of Public Education S. Uvarov proposed to give new original shape to the national educational system. 

He said that Russia needs such educational system which could produce skilled, professional, well prepared executors of the Emperor’s wishes. Such an educational system should not only provide knowledge to people, but also made them unconditionally loyal to the Emperor. Briefly speaking, Uvarov tried to deprive education of its most important integral part: an analytical and critical approach to an environment (specifically to the political environment).

According to Uvarov&#x27;s theory, the Russian folk (&quot;narod&quot;) were very religious and devoted to the Emperor, the Orthodox religion, and autocracy as unconditional bases of the existence of Russia. &quot;Narodnost&quot; (nationality) is deemed to be the necessity to follow independent national traditions and to fight foreign influence. The theory stated that it was necessary to reject western ideas—freedom of thinking, freedom of personality, individualism, and rationalism—which were considered by Orthodox hierarchs as dangerous and rebellious. The chief of Russian political police (the III Department of His Majesty&#x27;s Personal Chancellery) A. Benckendorff wrote that &quot;the past of Russia was wonderful, the present is splendid and the future is above all dreams&quot;. These three concepts were considered as &quot;pillar-walls&quot; of the Russian Empire. Uvarov&#x27;s triad was the first explicit statement of government ideology in Russian history since the 16th century. 

He repeated the triad and elaborated on the topic throughout the 16 years of his ministry and was eventually awarded the title of a count. &quot;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&quot; became the Uvarov family motto, decreed by Nicholas. Yet he also did much as a true educator, raising educational standards, establishing new colleges, and increasing the number of scholarships for overseas training. Under Uvarov, the &quot;Russian educational system, with all its fundamental flaws, came to emphasise academic thoroughness and high standards&quot;, although it also became more exclusive at all levels.

==Components==
The three components of Uvarov&#x27;s triad were

* Orthodoxy: Orthodox Christianity and the protection of the Russian Orthodox Church.
* Autocracy: unconditional loyalty to the House of Romanov in return for paternalist protection for all social estates.
* Nationality: &quot;Narodnost&quot; can be defined as &quot;fidelity to Russia&#x27;s distinct cultural heritage&quot; and deference to &quot;aspirations of the common people&quot;. It has been also translated as &quot;national spirit&quot;, and &quot;populism&quot;. Before its adoption by Nicholas I, was a central tenet of Russian Romantic writers, the Russian expression of a principle more often called Romantic nationalism.

The sequence of three parts of the triad remained fixed in all circumstances even when the words themselves changed: military cadets were instructed to be &quot;Christians, loyal subjects, and Russians&quot;; the common public motto called &quot;For Faith, Tsar and Fatherland&quot;.

The triad was inherently unbalanced in favor of centralized autocracy. The Russian Orthodox Church was impoverished and incapable of being an independent political force. The government remained wary of &quot;any&quot; philosophy, including theology. Nationality through empowerment of the people was not a choice from the start and became even less probable after the dreaded nationalist Revolutions of 1848 &quot;reduced Nicholas to a state of almost catatonic fear&quot;. It also ran against the ever-increasing role of Baltic Germans in the government system; even converted to Orthodoxy, they retained their distinct ethnicity.

==Public reception==
The press, censored by the state, eagerly embraced the new doctrine and was dominated by it until the end of Nicholas&#x27;s reign. Stepan Shevyryov, editor of &quot;&quot; magazine, asserted that &quot;even if we did pick certain unavoidable blemishes from the West, we have on the other hand preserved in ourselves, in their purity, three fundamental feelings which contain the seed and guarantee of our future development.&quot;

Slavophiles, in particular, accepted the anti-European, paternalistic aspect of the doctrine. Mikhail Pogodin explained the paternalistic, peaceful nature of autocracy as seen by Slavophiles: &quot;the secret of Russian history, the secret which not a single Western sage is able to comprehend: Russian history always depicts Russia as a single family in which the ruler is the father and the subjects are children. The father retains full authority over children while he allows them to have full freedom ... there can be no suspicion, no treason; their fate, their happiness, their peace they share in common. This is true in relation to the state as a whole...&quot;

Nikolai Nadezhdin, who initially entertained the Westernised, Schellingian notion of &quot;nationality&quot;, radically changed his mind in favor of Official Nationality in the wake of the Chaadayev affair (1837), writing that &quot;nationality had always consisted of love of the Tsar and obedience, and which in the future should display in itself, to Europe&#x27;s dismay, a brilliant lesson of how from the holy unity of autocracy, must arise an exemplary and splendid national enlightenment...&quot;.

Nikolai Gogol in his final work &quot;Selected Passages from Correspondence with His Friends&quot; (1847) extended Official Nationality to relationships between landlords and serfs: &quot;Make them [serfs] see clearly that in everything that concerns them you are acting in accordance with the will of God and not in accordance with some European or other fancies on your own.&quot;

== Comparisons to Putinism ==
A number of commentators have compared the ideology of Vladimir Putin, ruler of Russia since 1999, to the doctrine of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality. Faith Hillis of the University of Chicago has argued that Putin &quot;wants to reconstitute the Russian Empire and its guiding ideologies, which were orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality—except now, under the power of a very sophisticated police state.&quot; A 2014 paper in the Journal of Eurasian Studies argued that &quot;Putin has emphasized patriotism, power, and statism to justify centralization of power and authoritarian policies. Putin&#x27;s policies and rhetoric are strong analogs to those of Nicholas.&quot; Stan Grant of Charles Sturt University has argued that it &quot;remains Putin&#x27;s vision today. The church and the state are inseparable. The head of Russian Orthodoxy, Patriarch Kirill, has called Putin &#x27;a miracle of God&#x27;.&quot; Foreign Policy journalist Michael Hirsh has stated that the policy &quot;isn’t mentioned in Putin’s speeches and writings—he still likes to pretend Russia is a democracy—but it has been invoked by the far-right thinkers said to influence Putin, including Aleksandr Dugin, Lev Gumilev, Igor Shafarevich, Ivan Ilyin, Konstantin Leontiev, Sergei Petrovich Trubetskoy, and others dating back 200 years.&quot;

<text>Tower of London was a London Underground station in the City of London that closed in 1884, only two years after opening. It was situated near the Tower of London, on a site now occupied by Tower Hill Underground station.

It was opened on 25 September 1882 during the construction of the Metropolitan Railway (MR) to the north. Two years later, the MR and District Railway (now the District line) were connected to form the Inner Circle (now the Circle line) and a new station was built. This new station was opened on 6 October 1884 with the name Mark Lane (later renamed Tower Hill), just to the west of the Tower of London station, which closed on 12 October.

When the original Tower Hill station was itself closed in 1967, the current Tower Hill station was opened on the site of the closed Tower of London station. The remains of the Tower of London station were demolished during the construction of the new Tower Hill station.

<text>Operation Predator is an initiative started on July 9, 2003 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division of the Department of Homeland Security, to protect children from sexual predators.

Operation Predator targets foreign national sex offenders (deportable aliens), child traffickers, child-sex tourists, and people involved in all levels of child pornography, from producers to distributors to consumers.

As of January 2007, there have been over 9,300 arrests under Operation Predator. Over 1,000 of those arrests occurred within the first three months of the operation. More than 85% of the arrests made as part of Operation Predator have been arrests of foreign national sex offenders whose crimes make them removable from the United States. Approximately 40% of these are lawful permanent residents and approximately 40% of these are illegal immigrants. To date, more than 5,000 of these predators have been deported. They have also made arrests against human smugglers and child pornographers.

Operation Predator has become the main force behind President Bush&#x27;s PROTECT Act, which makes it illegal for Americans to travel abroad in order to have sex with a minor. This growing sex tourism industry is fueled by citizens of wealthy countries (mostly Americans, who make up an estimated 25% of all offenders) going to places such as Thailand, Cambodia, and Costa Rica, where they believe they will be protected by lax child protection laws or corrupt law enforcement. Those three nations have been working with ICE and World Vision on a public awareness campaign to stop this industry. Cambodia and Mexico had already been working closely with ICE to stop child sex tourism in their countries.

Some of Operation Predator&#x27;s other major successes to date include a single web portal to various sex offender registry databases and creating a National Child Victim Identification System. On the international front, they have increased cooperation with INTERPOL and various international governments to combat child pornography and child sex tourism.

There is also an Operation Predator iPhone app to allow users to receive alerts about suspected child sex predators, share the information with friends via email and social media, and submit tips.

The Department of Justice estimates that somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 U.S. children are sexually exploited every year. The United Nations estimates that one million children are forced into prostitution every year. ICE estimates that child sex tourism victimizes upwards of two million children a year.

==National Child Victim Identification System==

The National Child Victim Identification System is a massively inter-agency system run by Operation Predator in conjunction with the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Secret Service, the Justice Department, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

This system aims to provide federal and state agencies with a central database of child pornography to aid prosecution, and to positively identify children in child pornography.

The National Child Victim Identification System has been used to convict criminals by proving that the pornographic images the defendants possess are of real children, and not morphed or virtual.

<text>Léger-Félicité Sonthonax (7 March 1763 – 23 July 1813) was a French abolitionist and Jacobin before joining the Girondist party, which emerged in 1791. During the French Revolution, he controlled 7,000 French troops in Saint-Domingue during part of the Haitian Revolution. His official title was Civil Commissioner. From September 1792, he and Polverel became the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Saint-Domingue&#x27;s non-slave population. Because they were associated with Brissot’s party, they were put in accusation by the convention on July 16, 1793, but a ship to bring them back in France didn’t arrive in the colony until June 1794, and they arrived in France in the time of the downfall of Robespierre. They had a fair trial in 1795 and were acquitted of the charges the white colonists brought against them. Sonthonax believed that Saint-Domingue&#x27;s whites were royalists or separatists, so he attacked the military power of the white settlers and by doing so alienated the colonial settlers from their government. Many &quot;gens de couleur&quot; (mixed-race residents of the colony) asserted that they could form the military backbone of Saint-Domingue if they were given rights, but Sonthonax rejected this view as outdated in the wake of the August 1791 slave uprising. He believed that Saint-Domingue would need ex-slave soldiers among the ranks of the colonial army if it was to survive. In August 1793, he proclaimed freedom for all slaves in the north province. His critics allege that he was forced into ending slavery in order to maintain his own power.

==Early life==
Born in Oyonnax, France on March 7, 1763, the son of a prosperous merchant, Sonthonax was a lawyer in the Parlement of Paris who rose in the ranks during the French Revolution. Sonthonax&#x27;s wealth was due to his father&#x27;s business, which employed many people from the region, and had made his father the richest man of the village. Sonthonax finished his studies at the University of Dijon, becoming a well-known lawyer with the help of his wealthy father. A member of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, he became connected with Jacques Pierre Brissot and subsequently aligned himself with the Girondists.

==Mission==
In August 1791, a slave rebellion (the Haitian Revolution) broke out in the northern part of Saint-Domingue, the heart of the island&#x27;s sugar plantation economy. Saint-Domingue was also wracked by conflict between the white colonists and free people of colour (many of whom were of mixed race), and also between those supportive of the French Revolution and those for a re-establishment of the Ancien Régime — or failing that, for Saint-Domingue&#x27;s independence.

In 1792, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, Étienne Polverel and Jean-Antoine Ailhaud were sent to the colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haïti) as part of the First Civil Commission. 
They were accompanied by Jean-Jacques d&#x27;Esparbes, who had been appointed governor of Saint-Domingue.
He was to replace governor Philibert François Rouxel de Blanchelande.
The expedition included 6,000 soldiers.
The commissioners found that many of the white planters were hostile to the increasingly radical revolutionary movement and were joining the royalist opposition.
They announced that they did not intend to abolish slavery, but had come to ensure that free men had equal rights whatever their color.
D&#x27;Esparbes worked against the commissioners and became popular with the royalist planters.
On 21 October 1792, the commissioners dismissed d&#x27;Esparbès and named the vicomte de Rochambeau governor general of Saint-Domingue.

Their main goal was to maintain French control of Saint-Domingue and enforce the social equality recently granted to free &quot;gens de couleur&quot; by the French National Convention as part of the decree of 4 April 1792. The legislation re-established French control of Saint-Domingue, granted full citizenship and political equality to free male blacks and free male mulattoes, but did not emancipate the slaves. Instead, he was tasked to defeat slave rebellions and induce the slaves to return to the plantations. Sonthonax had initially decried the abolition of slavery to gain the support of the whites on the island. Upon his arrival, he found that some whites and free people of color were already cooperating against the slave rebels. He did exile many radical whites who would not accept free coloreds as equals and managed to contain the slave insurgency outside of the North.

Sonthonax and Polverel were sent to Saint-Domingue, as they proclaimed when they arrived, not to abolish slavery but to give to the free men, regardless of the color of their skin, equality of rights, granted to them by the decree of April 4, 1792. But ultimately, all slaves in the north province were granted freedom on August 29, 1793, by Sonthonax, and in the west and south provinces, from August 27 to 31 October, 1793, by Polverel. Following the proclamation, Sonthonax wrote a reply to those that were opposed to his and Polverel&#x27;s decision in 1793 to grant these select slaves this new freedom. He declares his never ending belief that civil rights should be granted to these Africans and defends his decision to free the slaves was not erroneous to do. Sonthonax&#x27;s &quot;Proclamation Au nom de la République&quot; explained his role in the Revolution. He was committed to make drastic decisions to prevent Britain and Spain from succeeding in their attempts to assume control over Saint-Domingue.

==Emancipation and conflict==
In February 1793, France declared war on Great Britain, which presented a new problem for Sonthonax. All those he had alienated in trying to uphold the French Revolution in Saint-Domingue proceeded to try and flee to the British West Indies (primarily Jamaica), where the colonial authorities gave shelter to the French counter-revolutionary émigrés. The white population in the colony declined significantly until only 6,000 remained after June 1793.

On 20 June 1793 a failed attempt to take control of the capital by a new military governor sympathetic to whites, François-Thomas Galbaud, led to the bombardment and burning of Cap-Français (now Cap-Haïtien). The burning was likely done by the roughly 1,000 non-native sailors among Galbaud&#x27;s forces. Sonthonax made General Étienne Laveaux governor and expelled Galbaud from the colony after a promise of freedom for ex-slaves who agreed to fight on behalf of the commissioners and the French republican regime they represented. Up to this point the commissioners had still been pursuing the fight against the black slaves, whose insurrection had begun in August 1791. Their emancipation was a momentous victory for all slave forces, and oral histories suggest a boost in their morale. On June 24, 1793, 60% of the white population left Saint-Domingue with Galbaud, most never to return. On August 29, 1793, with rumors of emancipation rampant, Sonthonax took the radical step of proclaiming the freedom of the slaves in the north province (with severe limits on their freedom). 
From August 27 to October 31, 1793, on his side, Polverel progressively emancipated the slaves in the west and south provinces.

It was during this time, and due to the new trend of conceding rights to blacks, that Toussaint Louverture began reforming his political philosophy to embrace France rather than Spain; however, he was cautious and awaited French ratification of emancipation before officially changing sides. 
On February 4, 1794, the French National Convention ratified this act, applying it to all French colonies, including Guadeloupe. Due to the fact that they were under a decree of accusation, on that day, Sonthonax and Polverel’s names were not pronounced in the convention, not even by Dufay, the deputy of Saint-Domingue sent by Sonthonax to explain to the deputies of the convention why slavery had been abolished in the colony.
The enslaved population of Saint-Domingue did not flock to Sonthonax&#x27;s side as he had anticipated, while white planters continued to resist him. They were joined by many of the free men of color who opposed the abolition of slavery in the colony, many of them being planters themselves. It was not until word of the ratification of emancipation by the French government arrived back in the colony that Toussaint Louverture and his corps of well-disciplined, battle-hardened former slaves came over to the French Republican side in early May 1794.

A change in the political winds back home caused Sonthonax to be recalled to France to defend his actions. Upon his arrival in the summer of 1794, he argued that the free people of colour, whom he had been originally sent to defend, were no longer loyal to France, and that the Republic should place its faith in the freed slaves. Vindicated, Sonthonax returned to Saint-Domingue a second time. The Comte d&#x27;Hédouville was sent by France to be governor of the island, but was eventually forced to flee.

==Return to France==
Toussaint, in the meantime, was consolidating his own position. The black general arranged for Sonthonax to leave Saint-Domingue as one of its elected representatives in 1797. When Sonthonax showed himself to be hesitant, Toussaint placed him under armed escort onto a ship bound for France on August 24. He died in his home town of Oyonnax on July 23, 1813, after sixteen years back in France.

<text>Malmøya is an island south of Oslo Central Station. Oslo, the capital of Norway. The island is mostly known for its large quantities of fossils from the Cambro-Silurian period and its rare flowers.
The name Malmøya is derived from &#x27;malm&#x27;, or &#x27;ore&#x27;, due to the extensive amount found on the island.

==History==

The labour movement had an education center at Malmøya, where the current kindergarten is located. The center was used from the mid 30s to the 50s, however, due to German occupation during the war the center lost its influence.

==Facilities==

For its relatively small area the island has quite a few different facilities. There is one bus that arrives once an hour (twice during rush hours) that stops in the center of the city of Oslo.

The Island also has a small shop that is open every day.
There is a communal beach on the west side of the island, as well as a restaurant/shop that is open during the summers, and a camping site, mainly reserved for handicaps.

The Island also houses a sailing and a rowing club.

==Nature and perseverance==

Parts of Malmøya are included in the Malmøya og Malmøykalven Nature Reserve, along with the neighbour island Malmøykalven.

<text>The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (or WPPT) is an international treaty adopted in Geneva on 20 December 1996. It came into effect on 20 May 2002. The treaty deals with the rights of two kinds of beneficiaries, particularly in the digital environment: performers (actors, singers, musicians, etc.); and producers of phonograms (persons or legal entities that take the initiative and have the responsibility for the fixation of sounds).

As of August 2023, the treaty has 112 contracting parties. The Treaty is open to States members of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and to the European Community. The treaty is administered by WIPO.

==Content==
WPPT was adopted with an objective to develop and maintain the protection of the rights of performers and producers of phonograms in a manner as effective and uniform as possible. This treaty would not disturb the existing obligations that Contracting Parties have to each other under the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations done in Rome, 26 October 1961 (Rome Convention). Articles 18 and 19 of the WPPT provide similar obligations for performers and producers of phonograms to contracting states as provided under Articles 11 and 12 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT).

The Treaty deals with the rights of two kinds of beneficiaries, particularly in the digital environment: performers (actors, singers, musicians, etc.); and producers of phonograms (persons or legal entities that take the initiative and have the responsibility for the fixation of sounds). 

* As far as performers are concerned, the Treaty grants performers economic rights in their performances fixed in phonograms (not in audiovisual fixations, such as motion pictures): the right of reproduction; the right of distribution; the right of rental; and the right of making available.
* As to unfixed (live) performances, the Treaty grants performers: the right of broadcasting (except in the case of rebroadcasting); the right of communication to the public (except where the performance is a broadcast performance); and the right of fixation.
* The Treaty also grants performers moral rights (the right to claim to be identified as the performer and the right to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification that would be prejudicial to the performer&#x27;s reputation).
* As far as producers of phonograms are concerned, the Treaty grants them economic rights in their phonograms: the right of reproduction; the right of distribution; the right of rental; and the right of making available.

As to limitations and exceptions, Article 16 of the WPPT incorporates the so-called &quot;three-step test&quot; to determine limitations and exceptions, as provided for in Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention, extending its application to all rights. The accompanying Agreed Statement provides that such limitations and exceptions, as established in national law in compliance with the Berne Convention, may be extended to the digital environment.

The term of protection must be at least 50 years.

The Treaty also obliges Contracting Parties to provide for legal remedies against the circumvention of technological measures (eg, encryption) and against the removal or altering of information (such as identification of performer). It also obliges Contracting Parties to adopt legal measures to ensure the application of the Treaty. 

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act is the United States&#x27;s implementation of the treaty (see WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act).

<text>The sergeant major or píntano (Abudefduf saxatilis) is a species of damselfish. It grows to a maximum length of about 22.9 centimetres (9.016 in). 

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Abudefduf saxatilis&quot; is found in the Atlantic Ocean. Populations in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean are found from the north eastern coast of the United States south to the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, islands around the Caribbean Sea, the eastern coast of Central and South America all the way to Uruguay. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, they are found from Portugal, Azores, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and western Africa. Its distribution remains unclear in the Mediterranean Sea due to possible confusion with &quot;Abudefduf vaigiensis&quot; and &quot;Abudefduf troschelii&quot;.
Juveniles are common in tide pools while adults are found over coral reefs. Sergeant majors are found at depths of .

==Description==
Adults can grow up to at maximum length. Normally, they would grow up to . The largest recorded specimen weighed had a weight of up to . &quot;Abudefduf saxatilis&quot; has 13 dorsal spines, 12 to 13 dorsal soft rays, 2 anal spines, and 10 to 12 anal soft rays. This fish is white with a yellow top. It has 5 black or dark blue vertical stripes. A faint sixth stripe might be present on the caudal peduncle. Adult males have a more bluish coloration and its stripes are less visible. There is a dark spot around its pectoral fin.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
This fish feeds upon the larvae of invertebrates, zooplankton (such as copepods and shrimp larvae), pelagic tunicates, smaller fish, crustaceans, and various species of algae (both benthic and pelagic). It is also known to feed on the waste and vomit of spinner dolphins.

==Behavior==
Individuals of this species form shoals of about several hundred individuals. Sometimes, they get cleaned of parasites by fish species such as gobies in the genus &quot;Gobiosoma&quot;, &quot;Bodianus rufus&quot;, &quot;Elacatinus figaro&quot;, and &quot;Thalassoma noronhanum&quot;. Sergeant majors also clean green sea turtles along with &quot;Acanthurus chirurgus&quot; and &quot;Acanthurus coeruleus&quot;.

===Predators===
Predators of this fish include &quot;Plectropomus leopardus&quot;, &quot;Thalassoma bifasciatum&quot;, &quot;Cephalopholis cruentata&quot;, &quot;Epinephelus striatus&quot;, &quot;Mycteroperca venenosa&quot;, and &quot;Rachycentron canadum&quot;.

==In the aquarium==
They are found in the aquarium trade but are regarded as difficult to breed.

==Reproduction==
The sergeant major is an oviparous species in which the males create nests on rocks, reef outcrops, shipwrecks, and pilings where the females lay their egg masses. The males actively chase the females in courtship before the female releases approximately 200,000 ref, ovoid eggs which are attached to the substrate by a filament; the eggs turn greenish after a few days and are guarded by the male. As he guards the eggs the male becomes bluish in colour, guarding them for about a week.

==Etymology==
Sergeant majors earn their name from their brightly striped sides, known as bars, which are reminiscent of the insignia of a military sergeant major.

<doc id="1061401" wikidata="Q2806388" url="?curid=1061401" title=".32 S&amp;W">
<text>The .32 S&amp;W is a straight-walled, centerfire, rimmed handgun cartridge (also known as the .32 S&amp;W Short), and was originally designed as a black powder cartridge. It was introduced in 1878 for Smith &amp; Wesson pocket revolvers. The .32 S&amp;W was offered to the public as a light defense cartridge for &quot;card table&quot; distances.

The .32 S&amp;W Short was the basis for several other .32-caliber handgun cartridges. The .32 S&amp;W Short can safely be fired in guns chambered for .32 S&amp;W Long, .32 H&amp;R Magnum and .327 Federal Magnum.

==Design==
Designed by the Union Metallic Cartridge Company (UMC) as a black powder cartridge using nine grains of black powder, the round has been loaded with smokeless powder exclusively since 1940. It is low-powered and perfect for use in small frame concealable revolvers and derringers. The round remained popular in the United States and Europe long after the firearms chambered for it were out of production. At one time, it was considered to be the bare minimum for a self-defense round and was judged unsuitable for police work.

For defensive uses, the .32 S&amp;W is grouped with other turn-of-the-century cartridges designed for use in &quot;belly guns&quot;, which are guns meant for use in point-blank defensive situations, such as in a carriage or an alleyway. These cartridges include the .25 ACP, .22 Short, .22 Long, and .22 Long Rifle. For comparison, the .32 S&amp;W projectile is over 40% larger in diameter and over twice as heavy as the lead round-nose bullet used in the standard velocity .22 Long Rifle of its day. The .32 S&amp;W&#x27;s velocity of approximately was very close to the .22 Long Rifle&#x27;s performance from a sub- barrel, but with larger diameter and better sectional density.

Although the .32 S&amp;W&#x27;s round-nose bullet was less than optimal for defense, the centerfire design did offer a significant improvement in reliability over these other common handgun calibers of the day. This performance made guns chambered in the cartridge very popular as a gentleman&#x27;s &quot;vest gun&quot; as evidenced by sales of around 5:1 based on surviving examples (.22 rimfire variants are significantly rarer). Having twice the bullet weight and similar velocity of .22 Long Rifle in the same platform, the .32 S&amp;W has around double the muzzle energy of a .22 rimfire in similar-sized handguns.

==Derivatives==
The .32 S&amp;W Long cartridge is derived from the .32 S&amp;W, by increasing the overall brass case length, to hold more powder. Since the .32 S&amp;W headspaces on the rim and shares the rim dimensions and case and bullet diameters of the longer .32 S&amp;W Long, the .32 H&amp;R Magnum cartridges, and the .327 Federal Magnum, .32 S&amp;W cartridges may be fired in arms chambered for these longer cartridges. Longer cartridges are unsafe in short chambers, so none of these longer and more powerful cartridges should be loaded into arms designed for the .32 S&amp;W.

==Use in assassinations==
Guns chambered in .32 S&amp;W have been used in at least three notable assassinations:
* Gaetano Bresci used an Iver Johnson revolver chambered in .32 S&amp;W to assassinate King Umberto I of Italy on July 29, 1900. Bresci hit his victim with four shots.
* Leon Czolgosz used an Iver Johnson revolver chambered in .32 S&amp;W to assassinate United States President William McKinley at the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York, on September 6, 1901. McKinley was shot twice in the abdomen at close range, and although he did not die immediately, he eventually succumbed to gangrene on September 14, 1901.
* Giuseppe Zangara used a United States Revolver Company (a subsidiary of Iver Johnson) revolver chambered in .32 S&amp;W to assassinate Anton Cermak, Mayor of Chicago, on February 15, 1933, in what may have been an attempt to assassinate President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. Cermak was shot in the lung and died on March 6, 1933.

<text>The .32 S&amp;W Long / 7.65x23mmR, often called the .32 Long, is a straight-walled, centerfire, rimmed handgun cartridge, based on the earlier .32 S&amp;W cartridge. It was introduced in 1896 for Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s first-model Hand Ejector revolver. Colt called it the .32 Colt New Police in revolvers it made chambered for the cartridge.

==History==

The .32 S&amp;W Long, a lengthened version of the earlier .32 S&amp;W, was introduced in 1896 with the Smith &amp; Wesson (S&amp;W) .32 Hand Ejector revolver, which, with its swing-out cylinder, has been the basis for every S&amp;W revolver designed since. In its original form, the cartridge was loaded with black powder. In 1903, the small Hand Ejector was slightly redesigned. The cartridge retained the same dimensions, but was now loaded with smokeless powder to roughly the same chamber pressure.

When he was the New York City Police Commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt standardized the department&#x27;s use of the Colt New Police revolver. The cartridge was then adopted by several other northeastern U.S. police departments. The .32 Long is well known as an unusually accurate cartridge. This reputation led Police Commissioner Roosevelt to select it as an expedient way to increase officers&#x27; accuracy with their revolvers in New York City. The Colt company referred to the .32 S&amp;W Long cartridge as the .32 &quot;Colt&#x27;s New Police&quot; cartridge, concurrent with the conversion of the Colt New Police revolver from .32 Long Colt. The cartridges are functionally identical with the exception that the .32 NP cartridge has been historically loaded with a flat nosed bullet as opposed to the round nose of the .32 S&amp;W Long.

==Current use==
In the United States, it is usually older revolvers which are chambered in this caliber. The cartridge has mostly fallen out of use because similarly sized revolvers chambered in .38 Special are more effective for self-defense. The cartridge is widely used internationally, particularly in countries like India that restrict the calibers available to civilian firearms owners. Revolvers are still produced in this caliber in South America, South Asia, and Eastern Europe.

The .32 S&amp;W Long is popular among international competitors in ISSF 25 meter center-fire pistol, using high-end target pistols from makers such as Pardini Arms, Morini, Hämmerli, Benelli, and Walther, among others, but chambered for wadcutter bullet type. The sporting variant of the Manurhin MR 73, also known as MR 32, is also chambered in .32 S&amp;W Long.

The IOF .32 Revolver manufactured by the Ordnance Factories Organization in India for civilian licence holders is chambered for this cartridge.

==Interchangeability==
The .32 S&amp;W Long headspaces on the rim and shares the rim dimensions and case and bullet diameters of the shorter .32 S&amp;W cartridge and the longer .32 H&amp;R Magnum and .327 Federal Magnum cartridges. The shorter .32 S&amp;W may be fired in handguns chambered for the .32 S&amp;W Long; and the .32 S&amp;W Long may be fired in arms chambered for the longer .32 H&amp;R and .327 Federal magnums; although the longer cartridges should not fit and must not be fired in arms designed for the shorter and less powerful cartridges.

The .32 S&amp;W Long and .32 Long Colt are not interchangeable. At one time it was widely publicized that these rounds would interchange, but in truth it has never been deemed safe to do so.

<text>Uxbridge Road was a railway station on the West London Railway from 1869 to 1940.
It was initially served by London &amp; North Western Railway and the Great Western Railway. In 1905 the line became a branch of the Metropolitan Railway, and later London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line. Uxbridge Road station closed on 21 October 1940 during World War II, when the West London Line was put out of service during the Blitz.

The station was located at the eastern end of the Uxbridge Road in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, west London, UK, just before the start of Holland Park Avenue, a short distance from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station on the Central line. The station entrance was situated on the site of the present-day Holland Park roundabout.

==History==

The Great Western Railway (GWR) opened the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) on 13 June 1864, and from 1 July 1864 carriages from Kensington (Addison Road) (now Kensington [Olympia]) were attached and detached from trains at Notting Hill; through services between Kensington and the City of London beginning in April 1865. A station had been built on the chord linking the H&amp;CR and West London Railway, but this never opened due to GWR objections. Following an agreement between the Metropolitan Railway and GWR in August 1868, Uxbridge Road station, designed by the London &amp; North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR), opened on the West London Railway on 1 November 1869. A GWR service from Great Western Main Line suburban stations to Victoria station passing through the station also stopped, with up to eleven services a day, initially from Southall and Reading.
In 1872 the GWR Addison Road service was extended to Mansion House over the District Railway, becoming the &#x27;middle circle&#x27;. This terminated at Earl&#x27;s Court from 1900, and from 1905 was replaced by a shuttle between Hammersmith &amp; City stations and Addison Road. The shuttle was replaced in 1907 by four electric trains an hour from Addison Road to Aldgate. This service appears on the first &#x27;London Underground&#x27; map in 1908 as a Metropolitan Railway service. The GWR service to Victoria was withdrawn after 1915, but they were to provide a workman&#x27;s service from Greenford to Kensington from 1922 to 1938.

Also from 1872 a L&amp;NWR &#x27;outer circle&#x27; service from to Mansion House passed through the station. In 1909 the L&amp;NWR also ran several through trains to Southern England over the line, and some called at Uxbridge Road. The outer circle was cut back to Earl&#x27;s Court in 1909 and by 1914, when electric services began, was a Willesden Junction to Earl&#x27;s Court shuttle. The service from Earl&#x27;s Court to Uxbridge Road appears on the first &#x27;London Underground&#x27; map in 1908 as a District Railway service.

The West London Railway was bombed several times in September and October 1940, and closed 21 October 1940. Passenger services over the entire line did not restart after the war.

==Resurrection of station==
As part of the redevelopment of the White City site, a new main line and London Overground station named Shepherd&#x27;s Bush opened in 2008, on part of the site of the original Uxbridge Road station site as an interchange with Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Central line station.

<text>The .256 Winchester Magnum is a firearms cartridge developed by Winchester, and was produced by necking-down a .357 Magnum cartridge to .257 diameter. It was designed for shooting small game and varmints.

==History==
Introduced in 1960, Winchester offered ammo and reloading components into the early 1990s. The cartridge was first chambered in the Ruger Hawkeye single shot pistol. The next year (1962) Marlin chambered their Model 62 Levermatic rifle for the new Winchester cartridge. These were the two principal firearms chambered for the .256 Win. Mag. It is now obsolete and only offered as a chambering by custom manufacturers of single-shot firearm barrels such as Match Grade Machine and Bullberry. Previously, the Thompson Center Custom Shop had produced some, before closing its doors in 2010.

==Ballistics==
From an 8.5 inch pistol barrel the 60 grain .256 Winchester factory load was advertised as having a MV of 2350 fps and ME of 735 ft. lbs. This was 250 fps faster and nearly twice as powerful as the .22 Remington Jet, a varmint cartridge for revolvers that was also based on a necked-down .357 Magnum case.

According to data from the fifth edition of the Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading, handloaders with a .256 rifle can approximately duplicate the Winchester factory load using the Hornady 60 grain Flat Point bullet in front of 15.5 grains of H4227 powder for a MV of 2700 fps. The trajectory of that load looks like this: +2.3 inches at 50 yards, +4.4 inches at 100 yards, 0 at 200 yards, and -26.2 inches at 300 yards.

Winchester offered factory loaded .256 Magnum ammunition (and brass to reloaders) into the beginning of the 1990s. Winchester .256 factory loads used a 60 grain Open Point Expanding bullet at a MV of 2760 fps and ME of 1015 ft. lbs. from a 24-inch rifle barrel. That is about 500 fps faster than Winchester factory loads for the old .25-20 cartridge. At 200 yards the velocity was 1542 fps and the remaining energy was 317 ft. lbs.

The .256 Winchester Magnum was chambered in a very small selection of firearms, and never achieved great commercial success. Its firearms included:

*Marlin Model 62 Levermatic lever action
*Universal Firearms M1 carbine variant
*Ruger Hawkeye single-shot pistol
*Thompson Center Contender single-shot pistol barrel chambering

The 256 Winchester Magnum is also chambered occasionally in custom-built revolvers. Past candidates for this caliber conversion have included Ruger Old Model and New Model Blackhawks, and Smith &amp; Wesson K-frames (Models 10, 14, 15, and 19). Colt produced one Python in this caliber as a prototype and retains it in their museum.

<text>Elizabeth Estaugh, née Haddon (May 25, 1680 – March 30, 1762) was an American pioneer. She was the founder of Haddon Township and Haddonfield, New Jersey.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Haddon was born in Southwark, London, England, May 25, 1680. She was the third child of John Haddon, a blacksmith, and Elizabeth, née Clarke. Her father was a Quaker who faced religious persecution and was convinced by William Penn to move abroad. In 1702, he bought a 500-acre (2 km2) tract of land in Gloucester County in the English colony of West Jersey. However, he was appointed as an officer of the Pennsylvania Land Company and the London Lead Company, so he did not leave England.

==Career==

Haddon, a single woman, set sail from Southwark to the New World in 1701 without her family at the age of twenty or twenty-one. Her father had a house built for her at Cooper&#x27;s Creek, Newtown Township. With the help of a widowed friend and two manservants, she developed the Haddonfield plantation.

She had met John Estaugh (1676–1742), a Quaker minister, at Bermondsey years before. Their courtship was described, fancifully, by Lydia Maria Child in &quot;The Youthful Emigrant. A True Story of the Early Settlement of New Jersey&quot;, first published on May 21, 1845, in the &quot;New-York Daily Tribune.&quot; Henry Wadsworth Longfellow drew on Child&#x27;s account in writing &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, a poem in the third volume of his &quot;Tales of a Wayside Inn&quot;. They were married on the banks of the Cooper&#x27;s Creek on December 1, 1702.

At first, the couple were engaged in establishing themselves and run the land owned by Elizabeth’s father. This would, however, change as time passed on. Haddon and John had no children, but they brought her sister&#x27;s son, Ebenezer Hopkins, to America from Southwark when he was about five, and raised him as their son and heir. Ebenezer was the son of Benjamin and Sarah (Haddon) Hopkins, and the grandson of William and Katheryn Hopkins. Ebenezer was the progenitor of the Hopkins family of Haddonfield, New Jersey.

In 1713, John and Elizabeth built a three-story brick mansion called New Haddonfield Plantation, where Haddon managed the family property and her husband tended to his missionary journeys; the Brew House she built in 1713 still stands in the backyard. Although the first recorded commercial female brewer in the Colonies was Mary Lisle, who inherited her father&#x27;s Philadelphia brewpub in 1734, there is reason to believe that across the river in South Jersey, Haddon was running a more-than-average homebrew operation.

She and her husband were active in the Quaker community. She was very close with Elizabeth Woolman, the sister of John Woolman. Elizabeth died at her Haddonfield home at the age of 82 on March 30, 1762. She was buried in an unmarked grave in the Burial Ground of the Haddonfield Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).

<doc id="1061449" wikidata="Q2917386" url="?curid=1061449" title="Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II">
<text>The evacuation of civilians in Britain during the [[World War II|Second World War]] was designed to defend individuals, especially children, from the risks associated with aerial bombing of cities by moving them to areas thought to be less at risk.

Under the name &quot;Operation Pied Piper&quot;, the effort began on 1 September 1939 and officially relocated 1.5 million people. There were further waves of official evacuation and re-evacuation from the south and east coasts in June 1940, when a seaborne invasion was expected, and from affected cities after the Blitz began in September 1940. Official evacuations also took place from the UK to other parts of the British Empire, and many non-official evacuations within and from the UK. Other mass movements of civilians included British citizens arriving from the Channel Islands, and displaced people arriving from continental Europe.

==Background==
The Government Evacuation Scheme was developed during the summer of 1938 by the Anderson Committee and implemented by the Ministry of Health. The country was divided into zones, classified as either &quot;evacuation&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, or &quot;reception&quot;, with priority evacuees being moved from the major urban centres and billeted on the available private housing in more rural areas. Each zone covered roughly a third of the population, although several urban areas later bombed had not been classified for evacuation.

In early 1939, the reception areas compiled lists of available housing. Space was found for about 2,000 people, and the government also constructed camps that provided a few thousand additional spaces.

The government began to publicise its plan through the local authorities in summer 1939. The government had overestimated demand: only half of all school-aged children were moved from the urban areas instead of the expected 80%. There was enormous regional variation: as few as 15% of the children were evacuated from some urban areas, while over 60% of children were evacuated from Manchester, Belfast and Liverpool. The refusal of the central government to spend large sums on preparation also reduced the effectiveness of the plan. Despite that, over 3,000,000 people were evacuated.

==Evacuation==


Almost 3.75 million people were displaced, with around a third of the entire population experiencing some effects of the evacuation. In the first three days of official evacuation, 1.5 million people were moved: 827,000 children of school age; 524,000 mothers and young children (under 5); 13,000 pregnant women; 7,000 disabled people and over 103,000 teachers and other &#x27;helpers&#x27;. Children were parted from their parents.

Goods as well as people were evacuated; organisations or departments departed the cities. Art treasures were sent to distant storage: The National Gallery collection spent the war at the Manod Quarry near Ffestiniog, North Wales. The Bank of England moved to the small town of Overton, Hampshire and in 1939–40 moved 2,154 tons of gold to the vaults of the Bank of Canada in Ottawa. The BBC moved variety production to Bristol and Bedford and moved senior staff to Wood Norton near Evesham, Worcestershire. Many senior Post Office staff were relocated to Harrogate. Some private companies moved head offices or their most vital records to comparative safety away from major cities.

Government functions were also evacuated. Under &quot;Plan Yellow&quot;, some 23,000 civil servants and their paperwork were dispatched to available hotels in the better coastal resorts and spa towns. Other hotels were requisitioned and emptied for a possible last-ditch &quot;Black Move&quot; should London be destroyed or threatened by invasion. Under this plan, the nucleus of government would relocate to the West Midlands—the War Cabinet and ministers would move to Hindlip Hall, Bevere House and Malvern College near Worcester and Parliament to Stratford-upon-Avon. Winston Churchill was to relocate to Spetchley Park whilst King George VI and other members of the royal family would take up residence at Madresfield Court near Malvern.

Some strained areas took the children into local schools by adopting the First World War expedient of &quot;double shift education&quot;—taking twice as long but also doubling the number taught. The movement of teachers also meant that almost a million children staying home had no source of education.

===Evacuation centres===

In 1939 the British Government passed the Camps Act 1939 which established the National Camps Corporation as a body to design and build residential camps for young people, which could provide opportunities for outdoor learning and also act as evacuation centres in the event of war. The architect T. S. Tait was responsible for the design of the buildings, which included accommodation for over 200 children and staff, recreational halls, wash blocks and a dining hall/kitchen complex. These camps were replicated in over thirty different rural locations around the country.

During the war years, they acted as safe refuges for city children. After the war the ownership of the sites was transferred to the local authorities. Over the years most of these sites have been lost, but the best preserved example today is Sayers Croft at Ewhurst, Surrey. The dining hall and kitchen complex is protected as a Grade II listed building because of the importance of Tait&#x27;s work, and because of the painted murals depicting the life of the many evacuees. Evacuation Centres were also set up by the Foster Parent Plan (FPP) for Children Affected by War, later renamed Plan International.

One evacuated school was sponsored by the FPP in Knutsford, Cheshire, with each child being financially supported by an American citizen. One female pupil, named Paulette, was sponsored by Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt.

===Overseas evacuation===
The Children&#x27;s Overseas Reception Board (CORB) approved 24,000 children for evacuation overseas. Between March and September 1940, 1,532 children were evacuated to Canada, mainly through the Pier 21 immigration terminal; 577 to Australia; 353 to South Africa and 202 to New Zealand. The scheme was cancelled after the was torpedoed on 17 September 1940, killing 77 of the 90 CORB children aboard. About 14,000 children were evacuated privately to overseas relatives or foster families, including 6,000 to Canada and 5,000 to the United States.

The BBC cooperated with radio networks in the host countries, to make &quot;Children Calling Home&quot;, a programme which enabled the evacuated children and their parents to talk to each other, live on air.

==Other evacuations==

A second evacuation effort started during and after the fall of France. From 13 to 18 June 1940, around 100,000 children were evacuated (and in many cases re-evacuated). Efforts were made to remove the vulnerable from coastal towns in southern and eastern England facing German-controlled areas. By July, over 200,000 children had been moved; some towns in Kent and East Anglia evacuated over 40% of the population. Also, some 30,000 people arrived from continental Europe and from 20 to 24 June 25,000 people arrived from the Channel Islands.

As thousands of Guernsey school children arrived in northern England with their teachers, some were allowed to re-establish their schools in empty buildings. Guernsey&#x27;s Forest School reopened in a church hall in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire where it operated until August 1945. As a result of the evacuation of so many Guernsey people to England, those returning no longer spoke the Guernsey language (Guernsiaise) after the war.

One of the speediest moves was accomplished by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway when it transferred its headquarters out of London. The company took over The Grove, on the estate of the Earl of Clarendon in Hertfordshire. This was made ready as offices and a number of huts built in the surrounding park. On 1 September 1939, it was decided to move in and the transfer was completed before war was declared two days later. Within three days some 3,000 of the staff were based at the new headquarters.
When the Blitz began in September 1940, there were clear grounds for evacuation. Free travel and billeting allowance were offered to those who made private arrangements. They were also given to children, the elderly, the disabled, pregnant women, the ill and those who had lost their homes (some 250,000 in the first six weeks in London). By the combination of all the state and private efforts, London&#x27;s population was reduced by almost 25%.

As bombing affected more towns, &quot;assisted private evacuation&quot; was extended. However, not all evacuated children, mothers and teachers were safe in the areas to which they had been evacuated. Air raids, unexploded bombs, military vehicles and military minefields posed risks to the evacuees wherever they were posted in the UK.

London proved resilient to bombing despite the heavy bombardment. The destruction in the smaller towns was more likely to provoke panic and spontaneous evacuations. The number of official evacuees rose to a peak of 1.37 million by February 1941. By September, it stood at just over one million. By the end of 1943, there were just 350,000 people officially billeted. Still, the V-1 flying bomb attacks from June 1944 provoked another significant exodus from London. Up to 1.5 million people left by September – only 20% were &quot;official&quot; evacuees.

From September 1944, the evacuation process was officially halted and reversed for most areas except for London and the east coast. Returning to London was not officially approved until June 1945. In March 1946, the billeting scheme was ended, with 38,000 people still without homes.

==Traumatic effect on children==
Even at the time, there were some that had grave concerns about the psychological effect on especially the younger children, and wondered whether they would be better off taking the risks with their parents.

In the early 2000s a number of evacuees came forward to clarify the many &quot;bad sides&quot; of the evacuation.

==Cultural impact==
The movement of urban children of all classes to unfamiliar rural locations, without their parents, had a major impact. The Evacuees Reunion Association was formed with the support of the Imperial War Museum. It provides opportunities for former evacuees to contribute and share evacuation experiences and for researchers to request information such as the long-term effects of evacuation upon children.

The evacuation spawned a whole literature of children&#x27;s and young adult fiction. The convenience of the setting for the writer is clear, allowing the child heroes to have adventures in a strange, new world. Some of the authors, like Nina Bawden, had themselves experienced evacuation.

*Kitty Barne&#x27;s Carnegie Medal-winning &quot;Visitors from London&quot; (1940) is an early novel about evacuees, set in Sussex.
*In Richmal Crompton&#x27;s &quot;William and the Evacuees&quot; (1940), William Brown is envious of the special treats the evacuees receive and organizes an &#x27;evacuation&#x27; of the village children.
*In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1950) the Pevensie children are evacuated from London to the stately manor that contains the wardrobe portal to Narnia. It is never stated in which part of England the house was situated.
*William Golding&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (1954) is about a planeful of evacuating children who are shot down over a tropical island.
*Michael Bond&#x27;s beloved children&#x27;s book character &quot;Paddington Bear&quot; (1958) is an anthropomorphised orphan bear, who – having stowed away from &quot;Darkest Peru&quot; – is found by a family at Paddington railway station in London, sitting on his suitcase with a note attached to his coat that reads, &quot;Please look after this bear. Thank you.&quot; Bond has said that his memories of newsreels showing trainloads of child evacuees leaving London during WWII, with labels around their necks and their possessions in small suitcases, prompted him to do the same for Paddington.
*Nina Bawden&#x27;s novel &quot;Carrie&#x27;s War&quot; (1973) is about Carrie and Nick, who encounter different religions when they are evacuated to Wales.
*Noel Streatfeild&#x27;s novel &quot;When the Sirens Wailed&quot; (1974) is about three evacuees and covers issues like rations for evacuees, relationship between evacuees and townspeople, and the problems encountered by those who stayed behind.
*Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s novel &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; (1977) is about two evacuees who befriend the crew of a crashed German bomber hiding on Dartmoor.
* Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s novel &quot;A Tale of Time City&quot; (1987) begins with the main character, Vivian, being evacuated from London. Jones herself was evacuated to Wales in 1939.
*Michelle Magorian&#x27;s novel, &quot;Goodnight Mister Tom&quot; (1981), tells the story of the evacuee Willie Beech and elderly Thomas Oakley with whom he is billeted. It was made into a TV film starring John Thaw as Mr Tom.
*In the Disney sequel to &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Return to Neverland&quot;, Wendy Darling&#x27;s children Jane and Daniel are to prepare for evacuation before Jane is kidnapped by Captain Hook. The introduction to the movie details about the evacuation order and how children need Peter Pan now more than ever.
*Kit Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Guests of War&quot; trilogy, beginning with &quot;The Sky Is Falling&quot; (1989), chronicles the story of ten-year-old Norah Stoakes and her younger brother Gavin, who are evacuated to Toronto.
*In the 2015 videogame &quot;We Happy Few&quot;, set in an alternate reality where Germany successfully invaded and occupied Britain during the war, the main character Arthur Hastings betrays his autistic brother Percival giving him up to the collaborationist authorities in order to be sent to Germany.
Novels for adults featuring evacuation and evacuees are:

*&quot;Put Out More Flags&quot; by Evelyn Waugh, in which Waugh&#x27;s anti-hero Basil Seal uses his position as Billeting Officer to extort bribes (for moving disruptive children elsewhere) from hapless and reluctant hosts.
*Noel Streatfeild&#x27;s adult novel &quot;Saplings&quot; (1945). 
*Connie Willis&#x27;s two-volume novel &quot;Blackout/All Clear&quot; (2010) has extensive chapters about a time travelling character from the future, a historian named Merope (she takes on the persona of Eileen O&#x27;Reilly, an Irish maid), who intends to study the impact of evacuation on the children. When she becomes stranded in the past, she eventually adopts two bratty children to raise herself.

Non-fiction:

<text>Calcinosis cutis is an uncommon condition marked by calcium buildup in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Calcinosis cutis can range in intensity from little nodules in one area of the body to huge, crippling lesions affecting a vast portion of the body. Five kinds of the condition are typically distinguished: calciphylaxis, idiopathic calcification, iatrogenic calcification, dystrophic calcification, and metastatic calcification.

Tumors, inflammation, varicose veins, infections, connective tissue disease, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia can all lead to calcinosis. Systemic sclerosis is linked to calcineuris cutis. Calcinosis is seen in Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis, also known as CREST syndrome (the &quot;C&quot; in CREST).

== Signs and symptoms ==

Lesions might be more severe and widespread, or they can develop gradually and show no symptoms. The nodules may cause pain and hinder function in addition to having a variety of sizes and shapes. The underlying condition determines the localization of the lesions in dystrophic calcification. The elbows, fingers, knees, and forearms are the most often affected regions in people with systemic sclerosis. Elbows, knees, and regions of prior inflammatory lesions in dermatomyositis are affected by calcification. Lupus erythematosus affects the limbs, buttocks, area beneath lupus lesions, and periarticular areas. Periarticular lesions are found in metastatic calcification. In tumoral calcinosis, the lesions are found around joints, but in idiopathic calcification, the lesions are found on children&#x27;s faces as subepidermal calcified nodules. In iatrogenic calcification, the calcification is found at venipuncture sites.

== Causes ==
Calcinosis may result from a variety of causes such as:
* Trauma to the region
* Inflammation (bug bites, acne)
* Varicose veins
* Infections
* Tumors (malignant or benign)
* Diseases of connective tissue
* Hypercalcemia
* Hyperphosphatemia

Calcinosis cutis is associated with systemic sclerosis.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Classification ===
Calcinosis cutis may be divided into the following types:

==== Dystrophic calcinosis cutis ====

Dystrophic calcinosis cutis is the most prevalent kind of calcification on the skin. The ectopic calcified mass usually consists of amorphous calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. Dystrophic calcification is linked to a number of illnesses, such as infections, hereditary diseases, cutaneous neoplasms, and connective tissue diseases. The clinical manifestation can be as minor as an accidental radiography imaging finding or as severe as subcutaneous nodules or plaques.

==== Metastatic calcinosis cutis ====
Metastatic calcinosis cutis is the consequence of calcium salts precipitating in normal tissue due to an underlying abnormality in the metabolism of phosphate and/or calcium. Metastatic calcification can result from any systemic condition raising serum calcium and/or phosphate levels. Chronic renal failure is the most frequent underlying cause.

==== Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis ====
Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis is characterized by firm nodules in the subcutis or dermis, which are caused by calcium salts precipitating quickly in the skin. This occurrence typically manifests as a warm, sensitive swelling at the site of venipuncture, and it most frequently happens following the extravasation of intravenous calcium chloride, calcium gluconate, or phosphate-containing solutions. Iatrogenic calcification, which manifests as soft yellow-white epidermal plaques, has also been linked to calcium salt exposure via electroencephalography or electromyographic electrode compounds.

==== Traumatic calcinosis cutis ====
Traumatic calcinosis cutis is a cutaneous condition characterized by calcification of the skin resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus often resulting from occupational exposure, as in cases reported in oil-field workers and coal miners.

==== Idiopathic calcinosis cutis ====
Skin calcification that is not linked to a systemic illness or an underlying tissue injury is referred to as idiopathic calcification. Most often, the calcification is restricted to a single general location, yet there has been one case of calcinosis cutis that is exceptionally broad.

==== Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis ====
Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis is a cutaneous condition characterized by calcification of the skin resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus occurring on the scrotum. However, the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood are normal. Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis typically affects young males, with an onset between adolescence and early adulthood. The scrotal calcinosis appears, without any symptoms, as yellowish nodules that range in size from 1 mm to several centimeters.

==== Subepidermal calcified nodule ====
Subepidermal calcified nodule is characterized by calcification of the skin resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus, occurring most frequently as one or a few skin lesions on the scalp or face of children.

==== Tumoral calcinosis ====
Tumoral calcinosis is distinguished by the accumulation of calcific masses surrounding the main joints. It mainly affects teens who are otherwise in good health. Joint function may be hampered by the subcutaneous or intramuscular calcified deposits.

==== Osteoma cutis ====
Osteoma cutis is a cutaneous condition characterized by the presence of bone within the skin in the absence of a preexisting or associated lesion. Osteoma cutis often manifests as solid, varying-sized, skin-colored subcutaneous nodules.

== Treatment ==
Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, has been a mainstay of medical treatment for calcinosis cutis. It is thought to work by modifying intracellular calcium levels, which reduces the capacity for the production and crystallization of calcium nidus.

Colchicine is an antimicrotubule drug with anti-inflammatory properties that has been used for gouty arthritis treatment for a long time. Calcinosis cutis inflammation brought on by a foreign body-like response aggravates the illness&#x27;s symptoms. Colchicine, therefore, has been used to treat calcinosis cutis, albeit with varying degrees of success.

<doc id="1061469" wikidata="Q1756018" url="?curid=1061469" title="Microsoft Macro Assembler">
<text>Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is an x86 assembler that uses the Intel syntax for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. Beginning with MASM 8.0, there are two versions of the assembler: One for 16-bit &amp; 32-bit assembly sources, and another (ML64) for 64-bit sources only.

MASM is maintained by Microsoft, but since version 6.12 it has not been sold as a separate product. It is instead supplied with various Microsoft SDKs and C compilers. Recent versions of MASM are included with Microsoft Visual Studio.

Notable applications compiled using MASM are RollerCoaster Tycoon which was 99% written in assembly language and built with MASM.

==History==
The earliest versions of MASM date back to 1981. They were sold either as the generic &quot;Microsoft Macro Assembler&quot; for all x86 machines or as the OEM version specifically for IBM PCs. By Version 4.0, the IBM release was dropped. Up to Version 3.0, MASM was also bundled with a smaller companion assembler, ASM.EXE. This was intended for PCs with only 64k of memory and lacked some features of the full MASM, such as the ability to use code macros.

MS-DOS versions up to 4.x included Microsoft&#x27;s LINK utility, which was designed to convert intermediate OBJ files generated by MASM and other compilers; however, as users who did not program had no use of the utility, it was moved to their compiler packages.

Version 4.0, released October 1985, added support for 286 instructions.

Version 5.0, released August 1987, supported 386 instructions, and also shorthand mnemonics for segment descriptors (.code, .data, etc.), but it could still only generate real mode executables.

Through version 5.0, MASM was available as an MS-DOS application only. Versions 5.1 and 6.0 were available as both MS-DOS and OS/2 applications.

Version 6.0, released in 1991, added parameter passing with &quot;invoke&quot; and some other high level-like constructs, in addition to the already existing high level-like records, among other things. Both 6.0 and 6.0B were able to be run on an 8086 processor but could generate flat 32-bit 386 code. In 1992, 6.1 was released, which added support for the COFF object format used by Windows NT, and removed support for OS/2. 6.1 was built as a bi-modal binary before the Win32 API was finalized, and is incompatible with running on Windows NT due to missing exports.

In 1993 full support for protected mode 32-bit applications and the Pentium instruction set was added. The 6.11 MASM binary at that time (1993) was shipped as a &quot;bi-modal&quot; (win32, i.e. PE) DOS-extended binary (using the Phar Lap TNT DOS extender). However, the setup.exe is an MZ executable so won&#x27;t run under 64-bit versions of Windows, and the bi-modal ml.exe is compressed, and the decomp.exe is an NE executable, so also won&#x27;t run under 64-bit versions of Windows (if you were hoping to manually extract the required ml.exe and ml.err), so you effectively need access to 32-bit Windows (or MSDOS) in order to install it. Version 6.11 is the last version of MASM that will run under MS-DOS. There were a series of patches available, up to 6.11d, that need 32-bit Windows to run, but the patched ml.exe still has the Phar Lap dos extender so can still be run under MSDOS.

Versions 6.12 to 6.14 were implemented as patches for version 6.11. These patches were self-extracting PK executables (i.e. MSDOS), so won&#x27;t run under 64-bit Windows. Even if you extract them by other means, the patch.exe is an NE executable so won&#x27;t be able to run on 64-bit Windows to update ml.exe either. If you do run on a 32-bit Windows (or earlier), patch will strip the Phar Lap dos extender from ml.exe so it can no longer be run on MSDOS. The stripping of Phar Lap makes the MZ portion of the executable smaller, so that the &quot;PE&quot; signature is more easily visible, unlike the situation with 6.11 where the PE signature was a long way into the file.

By the end of 1997, MASM fully supported Windows 95 and included some AMD-specific instructions.

In 1999, Intel released macros for SIMD and MMX instructions, which were shortly thereafter supported natively by MASM. With the 6.15 release in 2000, Microsoft discontinued support for MASM as a separate product, instead subsuming it into the Visual Studio toolset. Though it was still compatible with Windows 98, current versions of Visual Studio were not. Support for 64-bit processors was not added until the release of Visual Studio 2005, with MASM 8.0.

After 25 June 2015, there are at least three different MASMs with the version number 14.00.23026. In Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise Edition, there is one &quot;amd64_x86&quot; ml and two ml64s, &quot;x86_amd64&quot; and &quot;amd64&quot;. They run on different platforms targeting different platforms:
* amd64_x86: generates 64-bit code, runs in a Windows 32-bit environment
* x86_amd64: generates 32-bit code, runs in a Windows 64-bit environment
* amd64: generates 64-bit code, runs in a Windows 64-bit environment

==Object module formats supported by MASM==
Early versions of MASM generated object modules using the OMF format, which was used to create binaries for MS-DOS or OS/2.

Since version 6.1, MASM is able to produce object modules in the Portable Executable (PE/COFF) format. PE/COFF is compatible with recent Microsoft C compilers, and object modules produced by either MASM or the C compiler can be routinely intermixed and linked into Win32 and Win64 binaries.

==Assemblers compatible with MASM ==
Some other assemblers can assemble most code written for MASM, with the exception of more complex macros.

* Turbo Assembler (TASM) developed by Borland, later owned by Embarcadero, last updated in 2002, but still supplied with C++Builder and RAD Studio.
* JWasm Macro Assembler, licensed under the Sybase Open Watcom EULA. Last updated in 2014.
* Pelle&#x27;s Macro Assembler, a component of the Pelles C development environment.
* UASM is a free MASM-compatible assembler based on JWasm.
* ASMC is a free MASM-compatible assembler based on JWasm.

==Mixed language programming support==
Documentation for 1987&#x27;s version 5.1 included support for &quot;Microsoft BASIC, C, FORTRAN, Pascal.&quot;

==Reception==
In a review of three assemblers, Michael Blaszczak of &quot;BYTE&quot; in February 1989 found that MASM 5.1 was the slowest and complained the most about code. He concluded that &quot;MASM takes some getting used to, but it gets the job done&quot; despite &quot;more than its fair share of frustrating quirks and oddities&quot;.

<text>Vire () is a town and a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Vire Normandie.

==Geography==
The town is located on the river Vire. Much of its surroundings consist of the &quot;bocage virois&quot;, a type of mixed woodland and pasture common in Normandy.

== History ==
In 1123, King of England and Duke of Normandy Henry I had a redoubt constructed on a rocky hill top, which was surrounded by the Vire river. The redoubt was stoned square at the bottom to assure the defense of the Duchy of Normandy against any attacks from Brittany or Maine.
At the beginning of the 13th century, King Louis IX of France ordered that the existing stonework be supplemented with exterior ramparts. However the second precinct was finished only in the early the 14th century.

At the end of the Middle Ages, the village prospered first with leather and then with textiles During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Vire was plundered in 1368 by large military companies, and delivered to the English in 1418. The English occupation would end in 1450, with many considering it a time of brutality and oppression. Notably, the execution of Hugues Vaux, owner of the largest farm of the village, after refusing to give up his farm to the English sergeant Fields, caused much grief among the population. Some inhabitants nevertheless benefited from the English occupation. Eugène Vergny, who provided Fields with information about the movement of the French troops, received the property of Vaux after his execution.

During the reign of Louis XIII of France, because a number of Fortifications of the Middle Ages served in rebellions by the Huguenots in particular, the castle and its precinct were dismantled on orders of Richelieu.
During the 19th century, the village did not respond well to the Industrial Revolution and went into an important recession.

The castle of Tracy, the manor of 19th-century the French historian Arcisse de Caumont, can be found just north of Vire in the old community of Neuville.

Like many other Norman cities and villages, Vire suffered heavily from British bombings on June 6, 1944, or D-Day, during the Second World War. 95% of the town was destroyed. One of the two target-marking flare groups was out of alignment and much of the bombing fell across the town of Vire. The Master Bomber in charge of the operation identified the problem and issued corrections to the incoming aircraft. Much of the bombing from the first wave of aircraft fell across the town of Vire killing many of the inhabitants. It was a distressing night for many families.
After two days of heavy fighting, with 108 soldiers killed and four missing, the town was liberated on 8 August 1944 by the 1st Bn of the 116th Regiment of Infantry of the 29th Infantry Div. of the US Army.

The reconstruction of Vire began in the 1960s.

<doc id="1061478" wikidata="Q213992" url="?curid=1061478" title="Jacques Le Goff">
<text>Jacques Le Goff (; 1 January 1924 – 1 April 2014) was a French historian and prolific author specializing in the Middle Ages, particularly the 12th and 13th centuries.

Le Goff championed the Annales School movement, which emphasizes long-term trends over the topics of politics, diplomacy, and war that dominated 19th-century historical research. From 1972 to 1977, he was the head of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) in Paris. He was a leading figure of New History, related to cultural history. Le Goff argued that the Middle Ages formed a civilization of its own, distinct from both Classical Antiquity and the modern world.

==Life and writings==
A prolific medievalist of international renown, Le Goff was sometimes considered the principal heir and continuator of the movement known as Annales School (&quot;École des Annales&quot;), founded by his intellectual mentor Marc Bloch. Le Goff succeeded Fernand Braudel in 1972 at the head of the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS) and was succeeded by François Furet in 1977. Along with Pierre Nora, he was one of the leading figures of New History (&quot;Nouvelle histoire&quot;) in the 1970s.

Subsequently, he dedicated himself to studies on the historical anthropology of Western Europe during medieval times. He was well known for contesting the very name of &quot;Middle Ages&quot; and its chronology, highlighting achievements of this period and variations inside it, in particular by attracting attention to the Renaissance of the 12th century.

In his 1984 book, &quot;The Birth of Purgatory&quot;, he argued that the conception of purgatory as a physical place, rather than merely as a state, dates to the 12th century, the heyday of medieval otherworld-journey narratives such as the Irish &quot;Visio Tnugdali&quot;, and of pilgrims&#x27; tales about St Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory, a cavelike entrance to purgatory on a remote island in Ireland. Alexander Lee argued in &quot;History Today&quot;, &quot;This innovative use of popular culture to uncover the roots of a central idea in the religious thought of the Middle Ages was firmly within the Annales tradition, but extended the boundaries of the Annalistes’ approach in such a way that its broader potential as an historiographical methodology was almost beyond question.&quot;

An agnostic, Le Goff presented an equidistant position between the detractors and the apologists of the Middle Ages.

Among his numerous works were two widely accepted biographies, a genre that his school did not usually favour: the life of Louis IX, the only King of France to be canonized, and the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, the Italian mendicant friar.

In October 2000 he received an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Pavia. He was also nominated Academician of Studium, Accademia di Casale e del Monferrato, Italy.

In 2004, he received the Dr. A.H. Heineken Prize for History from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>Oberstedten is one of four town subdivisions (&quot;Stadtteile&quot;) and one of three boroughs (&quot;Ortsbezirke&quot;) of Oberursel, located north of the core city and immediately northwest of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. It is part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area at the border of Bad Homburg.

==History==
Oberstedten was first mentioned 817 AD under the Name &quot;Stetine&quot;. Later it was divided in Ober-, Mittel- and Niederstedten. In the very neighbourhood the knight&#x27;s castle Hohenberg has been built, which was sold in 1200 AD to Gottfried von Eppstein. Today it is known as the Bad Homburg Castle with the famous &quot;Bergfried&quot; (white tower)

Around this castle the town Bad Homburg was founded by assimilating Mittel- and Niederstedten.

1972 Oberstedten was incorporated in Oberursel, but still has the area code of Bad Homburg (06172).

<doc id="1061485" wikidata="Q2593088" url="?curid=1061485" title="Wood Lane tube station (Metropolitan line)">
<text>Wood Lane was a station on the London Underground that was located in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, west London. It was opened in 1908 on the Hammersmith branch of the Metropolitan Railway (now the Hammersmith &amp; City line), on the viaduct adjacent to the bridge over Wood Lane and close to a station of the same name but on the Central London Railway (now the Central line).

It was closed temporarily in 1914, reopened in 1920 and eventually closed permanently in 1959 at which time it was served by the Metropolitan line.

== History ==

===Exhibition station===
The two Wood Lane stations were opened in 1908 to serve the Franco-British Exhibition and the 1908 Olympic Games in the area that was to become known as White City. The Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s Wood Lane opened with the name Wood Lane (Exhibition) on 1 May 1908 and the Central London Railway&#x27;s Wood Lane station opened on 14 May 1908. Both were intended to be temporary and to be closed after the exhibition and the Games. Wood Lane (Exhibition) station was closed on 31 October 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. The other Wood Lane became the permanent western terminus of the Central London Railway.
===Reopening===
The station was brought back into use on 5 November 1920, with the name Wood Lane (White City), but was open only when an exhibition or event was being staged.

It was served by the Metropolitan line and was between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Latimer Road.

===Final renaming and subsequent closure===
The Central line&#x27;s Wood Lane closed, and was replaced by White City station situated just to the north, on 23 November 1947. The Metropolitan line station changed its name to White City on the same date. It retained this name for the remainder of its existence.

Following a fire in which one of the wooden platforms was destroyed, the Metropolitan line White City station was permanently closed. It was last used on 24 October 1959, and the Television Centre complex now runs on both sides of the railway. The station at viaduct level was largely demolished; the ticket office at ground level remains and has been repainted, though is not visible from the street.

The entrance from Wood Lane (and a main entrance to the exhibitions) was situated along a road which no longer exists that ran approximately along the line of the entrance to the Television Centre multi-storey car park. The centre point of the platforms was approximately opposite the largest of the BBC satellite dishes to the west of the line.
As part of the plans for the redevelopment of White City, a new Wood Lane station was built on the Hammersmith &amp; City line. Opened on 12 October 2008, it is on the east side of Wood Lane about north-east of the former Metropolitan line station.

==Latimer Road &amp; Acton Railway==

The Latimer Road &amp; Acton Railway (LR&amp;AR), a nominally independent company, proposed a line linking the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway at Wood Lane with the Great Western Railway east of their Acton station. The H&amp;CR initially insisted that the LR&amp;AR built a separate exchange station at Wood Lane, rather than using the existing platforms. The GWR wanted the LR&amp;AR to also build a separate Acton station, and a house was demolished at Friar&#x27;s Place for this.

The railway was authorised by act in 1882, but between 1885 and 1893 four acts for extensions of time were needed, as the LR&amp;A Company could not reach agreement with the Great Western and the Metropolitan for joint-working of the line. When this was finally achieved (confirmed by act in 1895), capital could not be raised. The line was abandoned by act in 1900, after only small parts had been built, including an iron bridge (later demolished) over the North &amp; South Western Junction Railway near the current Westway road bridge. The later Ealing &amp; Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Railway followed a similar route to the proposed LR&amp;AR line, the Metropolitan ironically promoting a bill in 1912 to connect the Hammersmith &amp; City to this line, which failed on opposition from the Great Western, the Central London Railway, and the District Railway.

==Media==

The station was one of the filming locations featured in the first episode of the 1964 Doctor Who serial “The Dalek Invasion of Earth”, its undergrowth-filled appearance underscoring the episode’s concept of a seemingly abandoned future London.

<text>Ignatius &quot;Iggie&quot; Wolfington (October 14, 1919 – September 30, 2004) was an American actor. He was the youngest member of the prominent Wolfington family of Philadelphia, operators of a carriage business early in the 20th century and brother of the founder of Wolfington Body Company in Exton, Pennsylvania. He married Lynn Wood, an actress, in 1972.

==Early life==
Wolfington was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended West Philadelphia Catholic High School, then studied at the Bessie V. Hicks School of Drama.

Wolfington served with distinction in the 102nd Infantry Division (United States) at the Battle of the Bulge during World War II. He received a battlefield commission as a first lieutenant. He was awarded the Silver Star for his role in saving thirty men. He also received the Purple Heart for wounds he received in battle. At his death he was buried with full military honors, at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Career==
A life member of The Actors Studio, Wolfington is best known for originating the role of Marcellus Washburn in the Broadway musical &quot;The Music Man&quot;, starring Robert Preston, which earned Wolfington a nomination for the 1958 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical. Buddy Hackett was cast in the role for the 1962 movie version. Wolfington appeared as Mayor Shinn in the short-lived 1980 Broadway revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot;, starring Dick Van Dyke. He also played the role of Chef Ellsworth in &quot;Mrs. McThing&quot;, a 1952 play which featured Helen Hayes.

Wolfington worked in the earliest days of live television, then later became a familiar face on TV appearing in several popular programs including &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (“Mad Dog”, 1967), &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. He made a few television movies, and also appeared in TV commercials. Wolfington appeared in several motion pictures including &quot;Penelope&quot; (1966), &quot;Hex&quot; (1973), &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974), &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot; (1975), &quot;Telefon&quot; (1977) and &quot;1941&quot; (1979).

==Labor union officer==
For many years, Wolfington was a council member of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, a New York City-based labor union for stage actors. In 1969, he saw the need for a West Coast office of the Actors&#x27; Fund of America to provide medical and financial assistance to actors beyond New York. Until that time, stage actors outside of New York had experienced difficulty securing adequate support from the headquarters there. Wolfington handled over 10,000 cases in the fifteen years preceding his 2004 death in Studio City, California.

==Awards==
Wolfington received the following awards:

<doc id="1061511" wikidata="Q875932" url="?curid=1061511" title="Digital watermarking">
<text>A digital watermark is a kind of marker covertly embedded in a noise-tolerant signal such as audio, video or image data. It is typically used to identify ownership of the copyright of such a signal. Digital watermarking is the process of hiding digital information in a carrier signal; the hidden information should, but does not need to, contain a relation to the carrier signal. Digital watermarks may be used to verify the authenticity or integrity of the carrier signal or to show the identity of its owners. It is prominently used for tracing copyright infringements and for banknote authentication.

Like traditional physical watermarks, digital watermarks are often only perceptible under certain conditions, e.g. after using some algorithm. If a digital watermark distorts the carrier signal in a way that it becomes easily perceivable, it may be considered less effective depending on its purpose. Traditional watermarks may be applied to visible media (like images or video), whereas in digital watermarking, the signal may be audio, pictures, video, texts or 3D models. A signal may carry several different watermarks at the same time. Unlike metadata that is added to the carrier signal, a digital watermark does not change the size of the carrier signal.

The needed properties of a digital watermark depend on the use case in which it is applied. For marking media files with copyright information, a digital watermark has to be rather robust against modifications that can be applied to the carrier signal. Instead, if integrity has to be ensured, a fragile watermark would be applied.

Both steganography and digital watermarking employ steganographic techniques to embed data covertly in noisy signals. While steganography aims for imperceptibility to human senses, digital watermarking tries to control the robustness as top priority.

Since a digital copy of data is the same as the original, digital watermarking is a passive protection tool. It just marks data, but does not degrade it or control access to the data.

One application of digital watermarking is &quot;source tracking&quot;. A watermark is embedded into a digital signal at each point of distribution. If a copy of the work is found later, then the watermark may be retrieved from the copy and the source of the distribution is known. This technique reportedly has been used to detect the source of illegally copied movies.

== History ==

The term &quot;digital watermark&quot; was coined by Andrew Tirkel and Charles Osborne in December 1992. The first successful embedding and extraction of a steganographic spread spectrum watermark was demonstrated in 1993 by Andrew Tirkel, Gerard Rankin, Ron Van Schyndel, Charles Osborne, and others.

Watermarks are identification marks produced during the paper-making process. The first watermarks appeared in Italy during the 13th century, but their use rapidly spread across Europe. They were used as a means to identify the paper maker or the trade guild that manufactured the paper. The marks often were created by a wire sewn onto the paper mold. Watermarks continue to be used today as manufacturer&#x27;s marks and to prevent forgery.

== Applications ==

Digital watermarking may be used for a wide range of applications, such as:

* Copyright protection in some media like digital artworks.
* Source tracking (different recipients get differently watermarked content)
* Broadcast monitoring (television news often contains watermarked video from international agencies)
* Video authentication
* Software crippling on screencasting and video editing software programs, to encourage users to purchase the full version to remove it.
*ID card security
*Fraud and Tamper detection.
* Content management on social networks

== Digital watermarking life-cycle phases ==
The information to be embedded in a signal is called a digital watermark, although in some contexts the phrase digital watermark means the difference between the watermarked signal and the cover signal. The signal where the watermark is to be embedded is called the &quot;host&quot; signal. A watermarking system is usually divided into three distinct steps, embedding, attack, and detection. In embedding, an algorithm accepts the host and the data to be embedded, and produces a watermarked signal.

Then the watermarked digital signal is transmitted or stored, usually transmitted to another person. If this person makes a modification, this is called an &quot;attack&quot;. While the modification may not be malicious, the term attack arises from copyright protection application, where third parties may attempt to remove the digital watermark through modification. There are many possible modifications, for example, lossy compression of the data (in which resolution is diminished), cropping an image or video, or intentionally adding noise.

&quot;Detection&quot; (often called extraction) is an algorithm that is applied to the attacked signal to attempt to extract the watermark from it. If the signal was unmodified during transmission, then the watermark still is present and it may be extracted. In &quot;robust&quot; digital watermarking applications, the extraction algorithm should be able to produce the watermark correctly, even if the modifications were strong. In &quot;fragile&quot; digital watermarking, the extraction algorithm should fail if any change is made to the signal.

== Classification ==

A digital watermark is called &quot;robust&quot; with respect to transformations if the embedded information may be detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, additive noise, and quantization. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A digital watermark is called &quot;imperceptible&quot; if the watermarked content is perceptually equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content. In general, it is easy to create either robust watermarks imperceptible watermarks, but the creation of both robust imperceptible watermarks has proven to be quite challenging. Robust imperceptible watermarks have been proposed as a tool for the protection of digital content, for example as an embedded &quot;no-copy-allowed&quot; flag in professional video content.

Digital watermarking techniques may be classified in several ways.

=== Robustness ===

A digital watermark is called &quot;fragile&quot; if it fails to be detectable after the slightest modification. Fragile watermarks are commonly used for tamper detection (integrity proof). Modifications to an original work that clearly are noticeable, commonly are not referred to as watermarks, but as generalized barcodes.

A digital watermark is called &quot;semi-fragile&quot; if it resists benign transformations, but fails detection after malignant transformations. Semi-fragile watermarks commonly are used to detect malignant transformations.

A digital watermark is called &quot;robust&quot; if it resists a designated class of transformations. Robust watermarks may be used in copy protection applications to carry copy and no access control information.

=== Perceptibility ===

A digital watermark is called &quot;imperceptible&quot; if the original cover signal and the marked signal are perceptually indistinguishable.

A digital watermark is called &quot;perceptible&quot; if its presence in the marked signal is noticeable (e.g. digital on-screen graphics like a network logo, content bug, codes, opaque images). On videos and images, some are made transparent/translucent for convenience for consumers due to the fact that they block portion of the view; therefore degrading it.

This should not be confused with &quot;perceptual&quot;, that is, watermarking which uses the limitations of human perception to be imperceptible.

=== Capacity ===

The length of the embedded message determines two different main classes of digital watermarking schemes:

* The message is conceptually zero-bit long and the system is designed in order to detect the presence or the absence of the watermark in the marked object. This kind of watermarking scheme is usually referred to as &quot;zero-bit&quot; or &quot;presence watermarking schemes&quot;.
* The message is an n-bit-long stream formula_1, with formula_2 or formula_3 and is modulated in the watermark. These kinds of schemes usually are referred to as multiple-bit watermarking or non-zero-bit watermarking schemes.

=== Embedding method ===

A digital watermarking method is referred to as &quot;spread-spectrum&quot; if the marked signal is obtained by an additive modification. Spread-spectrum watermarks are known to be modestly robust, but also to have a low information capacity due to host interference.

A digital watermarking method is said to be of &quot;quantization type&quot; if the marked signal is obtained by quantization. Quantization watermarks suffer from low robustness, but have a high information capacity due to rejection of host interference.

A digital watermarking method is referred to as &quot;amplitude modulation&quot; if the marked signal is embedded by additive modification which is similar to spread spectrum method, but is particularly embedded in the spatial domain.

== Evaluation and benchmarking ==

The evaluation of digital watermarking schemes may provide detailed information for a watermark designer or for end-users, therefore, different evaluation strategies exist. Often used by a watermark designer is the evaluation of single properties to show, for example, an improvement. Mostly, end-users are not interested in detailed information. They want to know if a given digital watermarking algorithm may be used for their application scenario, and if so, which parameter sets seems to be the best.

== Cameras ==

Epson and Kodak have produced cameras with security features such as the Epson PhotoPC 3000Z and the Kodak DC-290. Both cameras added irremovable features to the pictures which distorted the original image, making them unacceptable for some applications such as forensic evidence in court. According to Blythe and Fridrich, &quot;[n]either camera can provide an undisputable proof of the image origin or its author&quot;.
A secure digital camera (SDC) was proposed by Saraju Mohanty, et al. in 2003 and published in January 2004. This was not the first time this was proposed. Blythe and Fridrich also have worked on SDC in 2004 for a digital camera that would use lossless watermarking to embed a biometric identifier together with a cryptographic hash.

== Reversible data hiding ==

&quot;Reversible data hiding&quot; is a technique which enables images to be authenticated and then restored to their original form by removing the digital watermark and replacing the image data that had been overwritten.

==Watermarking for relational databases==
Digital watermarking for relational databases has emerged as a candidate solution to provide copyright protection, tamper detection, traitor tracing, and maintaining integrity of relational data. Many watermarking techniques have been proposed in the literature to address these purposes. A survey of the current state-of-the-art and a classification of the different techniques according to their intent, the way they express the watermark, the cover type, granularity level, and verifiability was published in 2010 by Halder et al. in the Journal of Universal Computer Science.

<text>The Prophecy of the Popes (, &quot;Prophecy of Saint-Archbishop Malachy, concerning the Supreme Pontiffs&quot;) is a series of 112 short, cryptic phrases in Latin which purport to predict the Catholic popes (along with a few antipopes), beginning with Celestine II. It was first published in 1595 by Benedictine monk Arnold Wion, who attributed the prophecy to Saint Malachy, a 12th-century Archbishop of Armagh.

Given the accurate description of popes up to around 1590 and lack of accuracy for the popes that follow, historians generally conclude that the alleged prophecy is a pseudepigraphic fabrication written shortly before publication. The Catholic Church has no official stance, although some Catholic theologians have dismissed it as forgery. The prophecy concludes with a pope identified as &quot;Peter the Roman&quot;, whose pontificate will allegedly precede the destruction of the city of Rome.

==History==
===Publication and content===

The alleged prophecy was first published in 1595 by a Benedictine named Arnold Wion in his &quot;Lignum Vitæ&quot;, a history of the Benedictine order. He attributed it to Saint Malachy, the 12th‑century Archbishop of Armagh. He explained that the prophecy had not, to his knowledge, ever been printed before but that many were eager to see it. Wion includes both the alleged original prophecy, consisting of short, cryptic Latin phrases, as well as an interpretation applying the statements to historical popes up to Urban VII (pope for thirteen days in 1590), which Wion attributes to historian Alphonsus Ciacconius.

===Origin theories===
According to an account put forward in 1871 by Abbé Cucherat, Malachy was summoned to Rome in 1139 by Pope Innocent II to receive two wool palliums for the metropolitan sees of Armagh and Cashel. While in Rome, Malachy purportedly experienced a vision of future popes, which he recorded as a sequence of cryptic phrases. This manuscript was then allegedly deposited in the Vatican Secret Archives, and forgotten about until its rediscovery in 1590, supposedly just in time for a papal conclave occurring at the time.

Several historians have concluded that the prophecy is a late 16th‑century forgery. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a contemporary biographer of Malachy who recorded the saint&#x27;s alleged miracles, makes no mention of the prophecy. The earliest known reference to them dates to 1587. Spanish monk and scholar Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro wrote in his &quot;Teatro Crítico Universal&quot; (1724–1739), in an entry called &quot;Purported prophecies&quot;, that the high level of accuracy of the verses up until the date they were published, compared with their high level of inaccuracy after that date, is evidence that they were created around the time of publication. The verses and explanations given by Wion correspond very closely to a 1557 history of the popes by Onofrio Panvinio (including replication of errors made by Panvinio), which may indicate that the prophecy was written based on that source. In 1694, Claude-François Menestrier argued the additional interpretive statements were not written by Ciacconius, as the prophecy was not mentioned in any of Ciacconius&#x27; works, nor were the interpretive statements listed among his works.

One theory to explain the prophecy&#x27;s creation, put forward by 17th-century French priest and encyclopaedist Louis Moréri, among others, is that it was spread by supporters of Cardinal Girolamo Simoncelli in support of his bid to become pope during the 1590 conclave to replace Urban VII. In the prophecy, the pope following Urban VII is given the description &quot;Ex antiquitate Urbis&quot; (&quot;from the old city&quot;), and Simoncelli was from Orvieto, which in Latin is &quot;Urbevetanum&quot;, old city. Moréri and others proposed the prophecy was created in an unsuccessful attempt to demonstrate that Simoncelli was destined to be pope. However, the discovery of a reference to the prophecy in a 1587 letter has cast doubt on this theory. In this document the entourage of the Cardinal Giovanni Girolamo Albani interprets the motto &quot;De rore coeli&quot; (&quot;From the dew of the sky&quot;) as a reference to their master, on the base of the link between &quot;alba&quot; (&quot;dawn&quot;) and Albani, and the dew, as a typical morning atmospheric phenomenon.

==Interpretation==

The interpretation of the entries for pre-publication popes provided by Wion involves close correspondences between the mottos and the popes&#x27; birthplaces, family names, personal arms, and pre-papal titles. For example, the first motto, &quot;Ex castro Tiberis&quot; (from a castle on the Tiber), fits Celestine II&#x27;s birthplace in Città di Castello, on the Tiber. Efforts to connect the prophecy to historical popes who were elected after its publication have been more strained. For example, Clement XIII is referred to as &quot;Rosa Umbriae&quot; (the rose of Umbria) but was not from Umbria nor had he any but the most marginal connection with the region, having been briefly pontifical governor of Rieti, at the time part of Umbria. One writer notes that among the post-publication (post-1595) popes there remain &quot;some surprisingly appropriate phrases&quot;, while adding that &quot;it is of course easy to exaggerate the list&#x27;s accuracy by simply citing its successes&quot;, and that &quot;other tags do not fit so neatly&quot;.

Among the reported &quot;successes&quot; are &quot;Light in the sky&quot; for Leo XIII (1878–1903), with a comet in his coat of arms; &quot;Religion depopulated&quot; for Benedict XV (1914–22) whose papacy included World War I and the Russian Revolution; and &quot;Flower of flowers&quot; for Paul VI (1963–78), with fleur-de-lys in his coat of arms. Peter Bander, then Head of Religious Education at Wall Hall teacher training college, wrote in 1969:

M. J. O&#x27;Brien, a Catholic priest who authored an 1880 monograph on the prophecy, provided a more scathing assessment:
===&quot;Petrus Romanus&quot;===
In recent times, some interpreters of prophetic literature have drawn attention to the prophecy due to its imminent conclusion; if the list of descriptions is matched on a one-to-one basis to the list of historic popes since publication, Benedict XVI (2005–13) would correspond to the second to last of the papal descriptions, &quot;Gloria olivae&quot; (the glory of the olive). The longest and final verse predicts the Apocalypse:

This may be translated into English thus:

Several historians and interpreters note the prophecy leaves open the possibility of unlisted popes between &quot;the glory of the olive&quot; and the final pope, &quot;Peter the Roman&quot;. In the &quot;Lignum Vitae&quot;, the line &quot;In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit.&quot; forms a separate sentence and paragraph of its own. While often read as part of the &quot;Peter the Roman&quot; entry, other interpreters view it as a separate, incomplete sentence explicitly referring to one or more popes between &quot;the glory of the olive&quot; and &quot;Peter the Roman&quot;.

==Popes and corresponding mottos==

The list can be divided into two groups; one of the popes and antipopes who reigned prior to the appearance of the prophecy c. 1590, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is consistently clear. The other is of mottos attributed to popes who have reigned since its appearance, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is often strained or totally absent and could be viewed as shoehorning or postdiction. The list has most commonly been divided between mottos 74 and 75, based on the mottos that were explained by Wion and those that were not. Lorenzo Comensoli Antonini divides the list between mottos 73 and 74, based on the loose connection between Urban VII and the motto &quot;From the dew of the sky&quot;, and the reference to the prophecy in a 1587 letter, prior to Urban VII&#x27;s papacy.

René Thibaut divides the table at a different point, between the 71st and 72nd motto, asserting that there is a change in style at this point. He uses this distinction to put forward the view that the first 71 mottos are post-dated forgeries, while the remainder are genuine. Hildebrand Troll echoes this view, noting that mottos 72–112 use a symbolic language related to the character of the pope and his papacy, in contrast to the more literal mottos for earlier popes.

=== Popes and antipopes 1143–1590 (pre-publication) ===
The text on the silver lines below reproduces the original text (including punctuation and orthography) of the 1595 &quot;Lignum Vitae&quot;, which consisted of three parallel columns for the popes before 1590. The first column contained the motto, the second the name of the pope or antipope to whom it was attached (with occasional errors), and the third an explanation of the motto. There are some indications that both the mottos and explanations were the work of a single 16th-century person. The original list was unnumbered.

=== Popes 1590 to present (post-publication) ===
For this group of popes, the published text only provides names for the first three (i.e., those who were popes between the appearance of the text c. 1590, and its publication in 1595) and provides no explanations.

==In fiction==
The Prophecy of the Popes is referred to in several works of fiction, including several works of apocalyptic fiction. Steve Berry&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Third Secret&quot; (2005), features the fictional Pope Peter II (originally Cardinal Valendrea), who is elected Pope after the death of the fictional Pope Clement XV. In James Rollins&#x27; sixth Sigma Force novel, &quot;The Doomsday Key&quot; (2009), Saint Malachy&#x27;s &quot;Doomsday Prophecy&quot;, and the conflicts between the Christians and pagans are important plot points.

<doc id="1061525" wikidata="Q5537564" url="?curid=1061525" title="George C. Marshall Institute">
<text>The George C. Marshall Institute (GMI) was a nonprofit conservative think tank in the United States. It was established in 1984 with a focus on science and public policy issues and had an initial focus in defense policy. Starting in the late 1980s, the institute advocated for views in line with environmental skepticism, most notably climate change denial. The think tank received extensive financial support from the fossil fuel industry.

Though the institute officially closed in 2015, the climate-denialist CO2 Coalition is viewed as its immediate successor. GMI&#x27;s defense research was absorbed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

==History==
The George C. Marshall institute was founded in 1984 by Frederick Seitz (former President of the United States National Academy of Sciences), Robert Jastrow (founder of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies), and William Nierenberg (former director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography). The institute&#x27;s primary aim, initially, was to play a role in defense policy debates, defending Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, or &quot;Star Wars&quot;). In particular, it sought to defend SDI &quot;from attack by the Union of Concerned Scientists, and in particular by the equally prominent physicists Hans Bethe, Richard Garwin, and astronomer Carl Sagan.&quot; The institute argued that the Soviet Union was a military threat. A 1987 article by Jastrow argued that in five years the Soviet Union would be so powerful that it would be able to achieve world domination without firing a shot. When the Cold War instead ended in the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the institute shifted from an emphasis on defense to a focus on environmental skepticism, including global warming denial.

The institute&#x27;s shift to environmental skepticism began with the publication of a report on global warming by William Nierenberg. During the 1988 United States presidential election, George H. W. Bush had pledged to meet the &quot;greenhouse effect with the White House effect.&quot; Nierenberg&#x27;s report, which blamed global warming on solar activity, had a large impact on the incoming Bush presidency, strengthening those in it opposed to environmental regulation. In 1990 the institute&#x27;s founders (Jastrow, Nierenberg and Seitz) published a book on climate change. The appointment of David Allan Bromley as presidential science advisor, however, saw Bush sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, despite some opposition from within his administration.

In 1994, the institute published a paper by its then chairman, Frederick Seitz, titled &quot;Global warming and ozone hole controversies: A challenge to scientific judgment.&quot; Seitz questioned the view that CFCs &quot;are the greatest threat to the ozone layer&quot;. In the same paper, commenting on the dangers of secondary inhalation of tobacco smoke, he concluded &quot;there is no good scientific evidence that passive inhalation is truly dangerous under normal circumstances.&quot;

In 2012, the institute took over the responsibility for running the Missilethreat.com website from the Claremont Institute. Missilethreat.com aims to inform the American people of missile threats, thereby encouraging the deployment of a ballistic missile defense system. Since the closure of the institute, the Missilethreat.com website has been maintained by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

==Publications==
&quot;Politicizing Science: The Alchemy of Policymaking&quot; is a book by the George C. Marshall Institute, edited by Michael Gough. The book, published in 2003, encourages a disinterested objectivity on the part of scientists and policymakers: Ideally, the scientists or analysts who generate estimates of harm that may result from a risk would consider all the relevant facts and alternative interpretations of the data, and remain skeptical about tentative conclusions. Ideally, too, the agency officials and politicians, who have to enact a regulatory program, would consider its costs and benefits, ensure that it will do more good than harm, and remain open to options to stop or change the regulation in situations where the underlying science is tentative.

== Global warming ==

Starting in 1989 GMI was involved in what it terms &quot;a critical examination of the scientific basis for global climate change policy.&quot; This was described by Sharon Begley as a &quot;central cog in the denial machine&quot; in a 2007 &quot;Newsweek&quot; cover story on climate change denial.

In &quot;Requiem for a Species&quot;, Clive Hamilton is critical of the Marshall Institute and contends that the conservative backlash against global warming research was led by three prominent physicists—Frederick Seitz, Robert Jastrow, and William Nierenberg, who founded the institute in 1984. According to Hamilton, by the 1990s the Marshall Institute&#x27;s main activity was attacking climate science. Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway reach a similar conclusion in &quot;Merchants of Doubt&quot; (2010), where they identified a few contrarian scientists associated with conservative think-tanks who fought the scientific consensus and spread confusion and doubt about global warming. The book &quot;Climate Change: An Encyclopedia of Science and History&quot;, noting that GMI received funding from the automobile and fossil fuel industries and espouses &quot;a mix of conservative, neoliberal, and libertarian ideological positions&quot;, states that GMI has &quot;supported authors opposed to the hypothesis of anthropogenic warming and proposed mitigation policies ... stressing the free-market and the dangers of government regulation, which they said would hurt the US economy.&quot;

GMI was one of only a few conservative environmental-policy think tanks to have natural scientists on staff. Noted climate change deniers Sallie Baliunas and (until his death in 2008) Frederick Seitz (a past president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1962 to 1969) served on its board of directors. Patrick Michaels was a visiting scientist and Stephen McIntyre, Willie Soon and Ross McKitrick were contributing writers. Richard Lindzen served on the institute&#x27;s Science Advisory Board.

In February 2005 GMI co-sponsored a congressional briefing at which Senator James Inhofe praised Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;State of Fear&quot; and attacked the &quot;hockey stick graph&quot;.

William O&#x27;Keefe, chief executive officer of the Marshall Institute, questioned the methods used by advocates of new government restrictions to combat global warming: &quot;We have never said that global warming isn&#x27;t real. No self-respecting think tank would accept money to support preconceived notions. We make sure what we are saying is both scientifically and analytically defensible.&quot;

===Accusation of conflict of interest===
Matthew B. Crawford was appointed executive director of GMI in September 2001. He left the GMI after five months, saying that the institute was &quot;fonder of some facts than others&quot;. He contended a conflict of interest existed in the funding of the institute. In &quot;Shop Class as Soulcraft,&quot; he wrote about the institute that &quot;the trappings of scholarship were used to put a scientific cover on positions arrived at otherwise. These positions served various interests, ideological or material. For example, part of my job consisted of making arguments about global warming that just happened to coincide with the positions taken by the oil companies that funded the think tank.&quot;

In 1998 Jeffrey Salmon, then executive director of GMI, helped develop the American Petroleum Institute&#x27;s strategy of stressing the uncertainty of climate science.

Naomi Oreskes states that the institute, in order to resist and delay regulation, lobbied politically to create a false public perception of scientific uncertainty over the negative effects of second-hand smoke, the carcinogenic nature of tobacco smoking, the existence of acid rain, and on the evidence connecting CFCs and ozone depletion.

== Funding sources ==
Exxon-Mobil was a funder of the GMI until it pulled funding from it and several similar organizations in 2008. From 1998 to 2008, the institute received a total of $715,000 in funding from Exxon-Mobil.

<text>Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty (; 1629–1718 or 1716) was an Irish historian.

==Biography==

He was born in County Galway and inherited Moycullen Castle and estate.

O&#x27;Flaherty was the last &quot;de jure&quot; Lord of Iar Connacht, and the last recognised Chief of the Name of Clan O&#x27;Flaherty. He lost the greater part of his ancestral estates to Cromwellian confiscations in the 1650s. The remainder was stolen through deception, by his son&#x27;s Anglo-Irish father-in-law, Richard &quot;Nimble Dick&quot; Martin of Ross. As Martin had given service to some captured Williamite, officers he was allowed to keep his lands. It was therefore arranged that to protect from confiscation 200,000 acres of Connemara lands held by O&#x27;Flahertys, Joyces, Lees, and others that were transferred into Martin&#x27;s name with the trust they would be returned. However, Martin betrayed his former friends and neighbours and kept all of their lands. 

Uniquely among the O&#x27;Flaherty family up to that time, Roderick became a highly regarded historian and collector of Irish manuscripts. His friends and associates included his teacher Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh; Daibhidh Ó Duibhgheannáin; John Lynch; Edward Lluyd; Samuel Moleneaux and his father William. O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s published works included &quot;Ogyia&quot; and &quot;Iar Connacht&quot;.

He is often associated with his elaborate history of Ireland, &quot;Ogygia&quot;, published in 1685 as &quot; &amp; etc.&quot;, in 1793 translated into English by Rev. James Hely under the full title &quot;Ogygia, or a Chronological Account of Irish Events (Collected from Very Ancient Documents Faithfully Compared with Each Other &amp; Supported by the Genealogical &amp; Chronological Aid of the Sacred and Profane Writings of the Globe)&quot;.

Ogygia is the island of Calypso, used by O&#x27;Flaherty as an allegory for Ireland. Drawing from numerous ancient documents, &quot;Ogygia&quot; traces Irish history back to the ages of mythology and legend, before the 1st century. The book credits Milesius as the progenitor of the Goidelic people. O&#x27;Flaherty had included in his history what purported to be an essay on the understanding of the ancient Ogham alphabet. Based on the 1390 &quot;Auraicept na n-Éces&quot;, he stated that each letter was named after a tree, a concept widely accepted in 17th century Ireland.

&quot;Ogygia&quot; was immediately criticised for its scholarship by George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh (1636–91), Dean of Faculty (1682) at Aberdeen. The arguments about O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s work continued well into the 18th century, culminating in the 1775 &quot;The Ogygia Vindicated&quot; by the historian Charles O&#x27;Conor, in which he adds explanatory footnotes to the original work.

Thomas Molyneux visited O&#x27;Flaherty on 21 April 1709 and left the following eyewitness account:
O&#x27;Flaherty died in poverty at Páirc, near Spiddal. He was survived by his daughters, and a son, Micheal Ó Flaithbheartaigh.

<doc id="1061528" wikidata="Q6904798" url="?curid=1061528" title="Monte Kwinter">
<text>Monte Kwinter (March 22, 1931 – July 21, 2023) was a Canadian politician in Ontario. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 until 2018. He represented the ridings of Wilson Heights from 1985 to 1999, and York Centre from 1999 to 2018. Kwinter was a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson from 1985 to 1990 and also in Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s government from 2003 to 2007. Kwinter was the oldest person ever to be an MPP in Ontario, although at his death, Raymond Cho (politician), was seven months shy of surpassing him. 

On January 26, 2013, Kwinter became the oldest person to ever serve in the Ontario legislature at the age of 81 years 310 days, surpassing previous record holder Lex MacKenzie, who was 81 years and 309 days old when he left provincial politics in 1967.

On July 20, 2017, Kwinter announced that he would not be seeking re-election in the upcoming 2018 election and that &quot;the time has come to let the next generation serve, and I look forward to offering my support to our future York Centre Liberal MPP.&quot;

==Background==
Monte Kwinter was born in Toronto on March 22, 1931. He was educated at the Ontario College of Art, Syracuse University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and the Université de Montréal. He has a degree in fine arts, specializing in industrial design.

Kwinter worked in real estate before entering political life, eventually owning his own firm within the field. He was also a founding member of the Toronto Regional Council of B&#x27;nai Brith Canada, served on the board of directors of the Upper Canadian Zoological Society, and the Canadian National Exhibition, was chair of the Toronto Harbour Commission, chair of the Toronto Humane Society, vice-president of the Ontario College of Art, and served as an executive member on the League for Human Rights of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Canada.

Kwinter was also involved in the Liberal Party of Canada as a fundraiser and organizer and worked on John Turner&#x27;s 1984 leadership campaign.

==Politics==
===Peterson government===
Kwinter was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1985 as a Liberal, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative David Rotenberg and New Democrat city councillor Howard Moscoe in the North York riding of Wilson Heights (which has a large immigrant population and a prominent Orthodox Jewish community; Kwinter was himself Jewish).

Kwinter had been a strong advocate for the completion of the controversial Spadina Expressway in Toronto but abandoned this position soon after winning election.

On June 26, 1985, he was appointed Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations and Minister of Financial Institutions.

Kwinter was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1987, and was named Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology in September of that year. In June 1989, Kwinter was implicated in the Patti Starr corruption scandal. Starr, who was head of the National Council of Jewish Women, misused her position by having the organization make political contributions to the riding associations of prominent Liberal MPPs. Kwinter&#x27;s riding of Wilson Heights was among those who received these illegal contributions. On August 2, when Peterson shuffled his cabinet in the wake of the scandal, Kwinter was one of only two ministers who retained their positions despite the scandal. Eight other ministers lost their positions.

====Cabinet====

===Opposition===
The Liberals were upset by the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, although Kwinter himself was again re-elected without difficulty, although one contender was better known as the alter-ego of Ed the Sock.

Kwinter faced a more serious challenge in the 1995 election, which was won by the Progressive Conservatives; Tory candidate Sam Pasternak came within 3,000 votes of upsetting him. Kwinter was not a prominent figure in the Legislative Assembly during his time in the opposition, though he was nevertheless regarded as a strong community representative.

Despite having a reputation for being on the right wing of the Ontario Liberal Party, Kwinter supported left wing candidate Gerard Kennedy in the party&#x27;s 1996 leadership convention.

The Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris reduced the number of provincial ridings from 130 to 103 in 1996, forcing several incumbent Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) to compete against one another for re-election. In some cases, MPPs from the same party were forced to compete against one another for their riding nominations. Kwinter was challenged for the Liberal nomination in the new riding of York Centre by fellow MPP Anna-Marie Castrilli, who had unsuccessfully competed for the party&#x27;s leadership in 1996.

Castrilli&#x27;s challenge to Kwinter was extremely controversial, and was marked by serious divisions in the local riding association. Kwinter was subjected to a number of incidents of anti-Semitic abuse during this period, and on one occasion received hate mail at his legislative office. Castrilli was not involved in these incidents, but they were regarded by many as reinforcing the unpleasant character of the nomination battle.

Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty tried to convince Castrilli to run in a different riding, but was unsuccessful. Rumours began to circulate that Kwinter was planning to defect to the Progressive Conservatives in the event that he was defeated. As it happened, there was never an opportunity to test this speculation—Kwinter was able to defeat Castrilli, who defected to the Tories herself shortly thereafter.

Kwinter&#x27;s nomination difficulties proved to be his only real challenge of the 1999 campaign, and he was again returned by a significant margin in the general election. The Progressive Conservatives were again victorious across the province, and Kwinter remained on the opposition benches.

In 2002, Kwinter publicly opposed the Liberal Party&#x27;s position on tax credits for parents who send their children to private and non-Catholic denominational schools. The party opposes such credits as a detrimental to the public system. Kwinter referred to the distinction between publicly funded Catholic Separate Schools and non-Catholic denominational schools as one of discrimination, though he also opposed funding for non-denominational private schools.

===McGuinty government===
Kwinter was again re-elected in the 2003 election without difficulty. The election was won by the Liberals, and there was considerable media speculation as to whether or not Dalton McGuinty would appoint the septuagenarian Kwinter to cabinet again. Ultimately, Kwinter&#x27;s public disagreements with party policy were not enough to sideline his career: he was appointed Ontario Minister of Public Safety and Security (essentially a retitled Solicitor-General&#x27;s position) on October 23, 2003.

Kwinter put forward a plan to combat marijuana grow-ops in Ontario that would permit local utilities to cut off electrical power to those in the illegal industry. There were many who opposed this plan on the grounds that innocent citizens could see their power cut off without warning in the event of an administrative or legal error.

Kwinter was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election despite a stronger challenge from the Progressive Conservative Party due to its support for extending funding to Jewish and other religious day schools. Kwinter broke with the Liberal platform and cabinet solidarity by supporting the Progressive Conservative&#x27;s proposal. The Liberal government was re-elected however Kwinter was dropped from Cabinet in the post-election cabinet shuffle. While no official reason was given for the demotion the &quot;Jewish Tribune&quot; claimed that it was a result of the position he took on school funding during the election campaign though it did not name its source for this claim.

Following the cabinet shuffle Premier McGuinty appointed Kwinter to the position of chair Ontario investment and trade advisory council and the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Economic Development and Trade (Investment Attraction and Trade).

Kwinter retained his seat in the 2011 provincial election against Progressive Conservative candidate Michael Mostyn by 3,188 votes.

====Cabinet====

===Wynne government===
Kwinter&#x27;s riding association nominated him to run as the Liberal candidate in the next provincial election which occurred on June 12, 2014. He defeated PC candidate Avi Yufest by 6,066 votes.

From June 2014 to June 2016, he served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and International Trade. As of June 2016, he served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of International Trade.

In October 2016, it was reported that Kwinter was living in a nursing home, Kensington Place, while recovering from an illness. In March 2017, Kwinter reappeared in public after his months long recovery from shingles. Requiring the use of a wheelchair and aid from a caregiver, Kwinter intended to return to his role and run in the 2018 election, but later chose to retire from politics at the 2018 election, when the Wynne government was soundly defeated. Ramon Estaris lost that election, placing third to one-term MPP, Roman Baber. 

==Death==
Monte Kwinter died on July 21, 2023, at the age of 92.

<text>Cinemaware was a video game developer and publisher. It had released several titles in the 1980s based on various film themes. The company was resurrected in 2000, before being acquired by eGames in 2005.

== Cinemaware Corp. (1986–1991) ==
The company was founded in January 1986 by Phyllis and Robert “Bob” Jacob. Cinemaware&#x27;s first title was &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot;, a strategy computer game originally released for the Commodore Amiga. Bob Jacob was a film buff, and Cinemaware released other games based on classic film genres which were made as an attempt to emphasize action, graphics, and ease of play. Its games generally debuted on the most graphically powerful home computers of the era, the Amiga, Apple II, and Atari ST, and then ported to others, such as the Commodore 64, PC (running under MS-DOS), and the Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; is the most ported Cinemaware game.

Cinemaware expanded to sports games, with its &quot;TV Sports&quot; line, which featured elements of sports telecasts such as studio announcers. The &quot;TV Sports&quot; line covered basketball, ice hockey, and football. Some of the titles were only known by the generic name &quot;TV Sports&quot; in Europe such as&quot;TV Sports: Boxing&quot; and &quot;TV Sports: Baseball&quot;, which were released in the United States by Data East as &quot;ABC Wide World of Sports Boxing&quot; and &quot;Bo Jackson Baseball&quot;, respectively. In 1989, the company debuted its Spotlight Software label in order to release foreign titles for the American market, most notably &quot;Speedball&quot;.

By 1990, the NEC owned 15% of Cinemaware. Cinemaware went bankrupt in 1991. While porting &quot;S.D.I.&quot; to another system, one of the company&#x27;s owners demanded the programmers add more features, increasing the programming time and delaying the product&#x27;s release. Coupled with falling sales of their other titles amid an economic downturn, the company suffered. The company also suffered from software piracy, threatening to stop publishing Amiga games at several points because of the ease by which video games could be copied. Many of their games, including &quot;Wings&quot;, were cracked and spread amongst gamers before release.

== Cinemaware Inc. (2000–2005) ==
Lars Fuhrken-Batista later bought the Cinemaware trademark and associated intellectual property, founding Cinemaware Inc. in 2000. Cinemaware developed recreations of its past titles, updated for Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh. Dubbed the &quot;Digitally Remastered&quot; editions, these games feature the same gameplay as the originals, but with updated graphics. They also ported some of their older games to handheld systems, such as the Game Boy Advance. On their website, they have also released disk images of their original titles for use with emulators and some are emulated via Macromedia Shockwave.

The new Cinemaware developed newer versions of their classic games. Their first game in this endeavor was &quot;Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown&quot;, featuring an improved 3D engine and was released in September 2003 for Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. Since the 1.02 patch for &quot;Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown&quot; in December 2003, Cinemaware has made no official announcements for its other games. One developer made a statement in the website&#x27;s forums in October 2004 stating Cinemaware is still working on these projects, but no other announcements have been made since.

* &quot;Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown&quot; (2003, PS2, Xbox, Windows)
* &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; (2002, GBA)

* &quot;Wings&quot; (2003, GBA)

=== Acquisition ===
On October 6, 2005, Cinemaware was acquired by predominantly family-oriented game publisher eGames, Inc., and Lars Furken-Batista became Vice President of Development. Shortly after the acquisition, eGames announced the launch of Cinemaware Marquee, a publishing label to be used to bring new games to the U.S. market. Their first published game was &quot;Space Rangers 2&quot;, a critically acclaimed space adventure. Under their new label, they have brought &quot;Darwinia&quot; from Introversion Software, &quot;Moscow to Berlin&quot; from Monte Cristo, and &quot;Neighbours from Hell: On Vacation&quot; and &quot;Buccaneer&#x27;s Bounty&quot; from German publisher Ascaron to the American market. In 2007, eGames released an Adobe Flash version of &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot;, allowing more users to play the game. The website was titled &quot;Defender of the Crown: Heroes Live Forever&quot;.

<text>František Udržal () (3 January 1866 in Dolní Roveň, Kingdom of Bohemia – 25 April 1938 in Prague) was a Czechoslovak politician. 

A member and leader of the powerful Agrarian Party, his political career started as member of the local Diet of Bohemia, then of parliament of Austria-Hungary, then of parliament of Czechoslovakia. He served seven years as minister of defense and four years as prime minister of Czechoslovakia (1 February 1929 – 24 October 1932) in two periods (1 February 1929 – 7 December 1929 and 7 December 1929 – 24 October 1932).

<doc id="1061544" wikidata="Q1094056" url="?curid=1061544" title="City and South London Railway">
<text>The City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) was the first successful deep-level underground &quot;tube&quot; railway in the world, and the first major railway to use electric traction. The railway was originally intended for cable-hauled trains, but owing to the bankruptcy of the cable contractor during construction, a system of electric traction using electric locomotives – an experimental technology at the time – was chosen instead.

When opened in 1890, the line had six stations and ran for in a pair of tunnels between the City of London and Stockwell, passing under the River Thames. The diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains, and the small carriages with their high-backed seating were nicknamed &quot;padded cells&quot;. The railway was extended several times north and south, eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of from Camden Town in north London to Morden in south London.

Although the C&amp;SLR was well used, low ticket prices and the construction cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company&#x27;s finances. In 1913 the C&amp;SLR became part of the Underground Group of railways, and in the 1920s it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group&#x27;s railways, the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, forming a single London Underground line called the Morden–Edgware line. In 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board was created by amalgamation of the C&amp;SLR with the rest of the Underground Group, bus and other transport companies. This was a public authority but not nationalised until 1948 with the creation of the British Transport Commission. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.

==Establishment==
In November 1883, notice was given that a private bill was to be presented to Parliament for the construction of the City of London &amp; Southwark Subway (CL&amp;SS). The promoter of the bill, and engineer of the proposed railway, was James Henry Greathead, who had, in 1869–70, constructed the Tower Subway using the same tunnelling shield/segmented cast iron tube method proposed for the CL&amp;SS. The railway was to run from Elephant and Castle, in Southwark, south London, under the River Thames to King William Street in the City of London. The tracks were to be in twin tunnels in diameter, running for a distance of .
The bill received royal assent as the (47 &amp; 48 Vict. c. clxvii) on 28 July 1884. Section 5 of the act stated:

In 1886, a further bill was submitted to Parliament to extend the tunnels south from Elephant and Castle to Kennington and Stockwell. This received assent on 12 July 1887 as the &#x27; (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. cv), allowing the construction of the extension to be added to the work on the original route, which had begun in 1886. The tunnels on this section were of a slightly larger diameter – and extended the line by a further . Before the railway opened, a further bill received assent, granting permission to continue the line south to Clapham Common. The act was given royal assent on 25 July 1890 as the &#x27; (53 &amp; 54 Vict. c. cxiv), also effecting a change of the company&#x27;s name.

==Haulage and infrastructure==
Because of the small diameter of the tunnels as well as the difficulty of providing sufficient ventilation, the use of steam power, as used on London&#x27;s other underground railways, was not possible for a deep-level tube railway. Like Greathead&#x27;s earlier Tower Subway, the CL&amp;SS was intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling the cable through the tunnels at a steady speed. Section 5 of the 1884 act specified that:

The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation owned the rights to the Hallidie cable-car system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at , and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at . However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary Acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.

It is reported that this problem with the CL&amp;SS contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel&#x27;s construction had begun in 1886. Hence, CL&amp;SS chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.
The solution adopted was electrical power, provided via a third rail (This is now a fourth rail) beneath the train, but offset to the west of centre for clearance reasons. Although the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with during the previous decade, and small-scale operations had been implemented, the C&amp;SLR was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power. The system operated using electric locomotives built by Mather &amp; Platt collecting a voltage of 500 volts (actually +500 volts in the northbound tunnel and −500 volts in the southbound) from the third rail and pulling several carriages. A depot and generating station were constructed at Stockwell. Owing to the limited capacity of the generators, the stations were originally illuminated by gas. The depot was on the surface, and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled up via a ramp although, following a runaway accident, a lift was soon installed. In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives went to the surface only for major maintenance.

To avoid the need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored underneath public roads, where construction could be carried out without charge. At the northern end of the railway, the need to pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were built to the west of the station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.

==Opening==

The railway was officially opened by Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) on 4 November 1890, and was opened to the public on 18 December 1890. Initially, it had stations at:
*Stockwell
*The Oval (now Oval)
*Kennington
*Elephant &amp; Castle
*Borough
*King William Street
The Prince of Wales gave the following speech at the opening:
The original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at the ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as &quot;padded cells&quot;. Unlike other railways, the C&amp;SLR had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1 million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.
==Extensions to Clapham Common and Angel, 1890–1901==
Shortly before it opened to the public, the C&amp;SLR gave notice of its intention to submit another private Bill to Parliament, to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington. Because of the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension was not to be connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The Bill was rejected on the grounds that the extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C&amp;SLR published details of a revised Bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section.
Near Borough station the new tunnels would branch off via a new station to form an interchange with the SE&amp;CR and the LB&amp;SCR at London Bridge mainline station. The tunnels would then pass to the east of London Bridge, north through the City of London to Angel. Following a delay, during which a joint select committee reviewed the proposals of several new underground railways, the (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. ccvii) received royal assent on 24 August 1893. The Act also incorporated another Bill of 1893 to grant an extension of time to build the southern extension to Clapham.


Construction of the two authorised extensions was delayed while funds were raised and plans were finalised. Between 1895 and 1898, three further Bills were put before Parliament to keep the permissions alive and obtain additional approvals:
*1895: an extension of time for the 1890 Act and to allow for a new approach tunnel to be built into King William Street station. Approved as the (58 &amp; 59 Vict. c. xix) on 14 April 1895.
*1896: an extension of time for the 1893 Act and changes to the construction of Bank station. Approved as the (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. cclii) on 14 August 1896.
*1898: an extension of time for the 1896 Act, plans to add sidings to the southern extension at Clapham Common and plans to sell King William Street station and its approach tunnels to the newly proposed City and Brixton Railway (C&amp;BR). Approved as the (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. xi) on 23 May 1898.

The new tunnels permitted by the 1895 Act enabled the track layout at King William Street station to be modified to a single central platform with a track on each side. This was opened as a temporary measure while funds for the extensions were raised. Finance was eventually obtained, and construction proceeded so that the King William Street section closed and the first section of the northern extension opened on Monday 26 February 1900, with stations at:
*London Bridge
*Bank
*Moorgate Street

The southern extension opened on at mid-day on Sunday 3 June 1900 with stations at:
*Clapham Road
*Clapham Common

Like the original Stockwell station and the rearranged King William Street, Clapham Road and Clapham Common were constructed with a single station tunnel, with a central platform served by tracks on each side.
Work continued on the rest of the northern extension. The (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. v), approved on 25 May 1900, gave permission to enlarge the station tunnel at Angel to a diameter of 
 and the rest of the extension opened on 17 November 1901, with stations at:
*Old Street
*City Road (closed 1922)
*Angel

==Extension to Euston, 1901–1907==

Despite the technical innovations of the railway and the large passenger demand, the C&amp;SLR was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances. The dividends were low and declining (2% in 1898, 1% in 1899 and 1% in 1900) and the company had been accused of extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station. In an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next Bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway (I&amp;ER), albeit one that shared its chairman with the C&amp;SLR. 

The proposed railway was to run from the as yet unfinished C&amp;SLR station at Angel to the main-line stations at King&#x27;s Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The I&amp;ER Bill coincided with a rash of other railway Bills encouraged by the successful opening of the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another parliamentary joint committee in 1901. The Bill was approved, but the time taken for the committee&#x27;s review meant that it had to be resubmitted for the 1902 parliamentary session.

In the 1902 session, the Bill was considered again but was subject to opposition from one of London&#x27;s other underground railways, the Metropolitan Railway (MR), which considered the proposed extension to be a threat to its service between King&#x27;s Cross and Moorgate. The I&amp;ER also submitted a petition to allow the C&amp;SLR to take over the powers of the railway if approved. The committee reversed its earlier decision and rejected the Bill. In November 1902, the C&amp;SLR submitted a Bill in its own name for the Euston extension as well as the authority to take over the dormant powers of the C&amp;BR. At Euston, the railway was to have an interchange with the planned-but-not-yet-built Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR). 
The intention for the C&amp;BR powers was to adapt them to provide a new station at King William Street, which would have pedestrian subway connections to the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s Bank station and the District Railway&#x27;s (DR) Monument station. A third pair of tunnels was to be constructed under the Thames to connect with the original abandoned tunnels north of Borough station, and then the C&amp;BR route was to be constructed as previously approved with connections to the existing C&amp;SLR route at London Bridge and Oval. This time, the Bill was approved and received royal assent as the (3 Edw. 7. c. clxxiii) on 11 August 1903. Although the C&amp;BR proposals were never implemented, the Euston extension was quickly built and opened on 12 May 1907, with stations at:
*King&#x27;s Cross
*Euston

==Cooperation and consolidation, 1907–1919 ==
By 1907, Londoners had seen the network of deep tube underground railways expand from the original C&amp;SLR line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers as well as with the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.

In an effort to improve their collective situations, most of the underground railways in London: the C&amp;SLR, the CLR, the Great Northern &amp; City Railway and the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL, which operated the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR), the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR), the CCE&amp;HR and the DR) began, from 1907, to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the &quot;Underground&quot;. The Waterloo &amp; City Railway, operated by the main-line London and South Western Railway, was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement.

In 1912, the C&amp;SLR submitted another Bill for parliamentary consideration seeking to increase its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. A separate Bill was published at the same time by the London Electric Railway (LER, a company formed by the UERL in 1910 through a merger of the BS&amp;WR, GNP&amp;BR and CCE&amp;HR), which included plans to construct tunnels to connect the C&amp;SLR at Euston to the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s station at Camden Town. Together, the works proposed in these Bills would enable the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s trains to run over the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways.
On 1 January 1913, the UERL purchased the C&amp;SLR, paying two shares of its own stock for three of the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s, a discount reflecting the struggling financial position of the older company. Both Bills were enacted on 15 August 1913, as the (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. cx) and the London Electric Railway Act 1913 (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. xcvii).

The proposed extension and tunnel enlargement works were delayed by the First World War, and works could not begin until after the war could works begin.

==Reconstruction, connections and extension, 1919–1926==
In February 1919, with the war over, the C&amp;SLR submitted a new Bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved in the Act of 1913. The resulting Act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5. c. ci). In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to carry out the works for its own 1913 Act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were not in a position to raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.

The projects were made possible when the government introduced the Trade Facilities Act 1921 by which the Treasury underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. With this support, the Underground companies were able to obtain the funds and work began on enlarging the tunnels of the C&amp;SLR.

The tunnels were enlarged by removing several of the cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers. The northern section of the C&amp;SLR between Euston and Moorgate was closed from 8 August 1922, but the rest of the line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night. A collapse on 27 November 1923 caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations near Elephant &amp; Castle station filled the tunnel with soil. The line was briefly operated in two parts, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.

The Euston to Moorgate section reopened on 20 April 1924, along with the new tunnels linking Euston to Camden Town. The rest of the line to Clapham Common reopened on 1 December 1924. At the same time as the tunnels were being enlarged, the stations were modernised, with longer platforms, a new tiling scheme on platform and passageway walls and new frontages to the surface buildings. Some stations also received escalators to replace the original lifts.

While the reconstruction works were underway, the C&amp;SLR submitted a Bill in 1922 that contained proposals to extend the line south from Clapham Common through Balham and Tooting to Morden in tunnel. From Morden, the line was to continue on the surface to Sutton sharing part of the route of an unbuilt railway planned from Wimbledon to Sutton. (See Wimbledon and Sutton Railway for full details.)

The Bill was enacted as the City and South London Railway Act 1923 (13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5. c. ci) on 2 August 1923. Parallel negotiations with the Southern Railway over the proposals curtailed the extension at Morden, where a large new depot was constructed. The Morden extension opened on 13 September 1926, with stations designed by Charles Holden at:
*Clapham South
*Balham (opened on 6 December 1926)
*Tooting Bec (originally Trinity Road)
*Tooting Broadway
*Colliers Wood
*South Wimbledon
*Morden

Also on 13 September 1926, a further connection between the CCE&amp;HR and the C&amp;SLR was opened when tunnels were brought into service from the CCE&amp;HR&#x27;s Charing Cross station (now Embankment) to Kennington station, the latter having been rebuilt with four platforms. An intermediate station was constructed at Waterloo. Thus fully integrated, combined services operated over the C&amp;SLR and CCE&amp;HR routes using new Standard Stock trains. On tube maps, the combined lines were then shown in a single colour, although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s. Before the introduction of &#x27;Northern line&#x27; on 28 August 1937, the names &#x27;Edgware, Highgate and Morden line&#x27; and &#x27;Morden–Edgware line&#x27; were used in the mid-1930s.

==Move to public ownership, 1924–1933==
Despite the modernisation of the C&amp;SLR and other improvements made to other parts of the network, the Underground railways were still struggling to make a profit.
The Underground Group&#x27;s ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the Group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early years of the 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole Group.

In an effort to protect the Group&#x27;s income, its managing director/Chairman, Lord Ashfield, lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. During the 1920s a series of legislative initiatives was made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP) Herbert Morrison, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the existing Group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC&#x27;s tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. Eventually, after several years of false starts, a Bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board, a public corporation that would take control of the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway as well as all buses and trams within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full nationalisation – and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the C&amp;SLR and the other Underground companies were liquidated.

==Legacy==
The technologies of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C&amp;SLR shaped the direction of subsequent underground railways built in London. The C&amp;SLR demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. 

The C&amp;SLR thus encouraged the construction of a network of underground railways in London far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited loading gauge and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.

During World War II, the disused tunnels between Borough and King William Street stations were converted for use as an air-raid shelter, with entrances to the shelter at King William Street and at six sites south of the Thames (of nine planned). In the 1960s the disused tunnels were used to assist the ventilation of London Bridge station and all the entrances bar that at 9 London Bridge Street were infilled with concrete. It is now only possible to access the tunnels from Three Castles House or a passage from the Jubilee line at London Bridge. 

Most of the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s six original station buildings were rebuilt or modified during the improvements to the line in the 1920s or during more recent modernisations. Only the building at Kennington retains its original exterior and the dome over the lift shaft, a feature of all the original stations.

Locomotive 35 had been placed on display on a pedestal at the Metropolitan line&#x27;s Moorgate station following the C&amp;SLR&#x27;s reconstruction. It was badly damaged during an air raid, and was eventually removed. Carriage number 39 survived for over two decades after withdrawal as a summer house at Watlington, Oxfordshire.

<text> is a small Aten asteroid first observed in 2000. It is assumed to have a diameter of approximately – or roughly twice that of the Chelyabinsk meteor – and an assumed mass of 7.1 kg (71,000 tonnes), but the size is only known within about a factor 2. , it is the largest object known to have a better than 1/1000 chance (0.1%) of impacting Earth and has the third highest cumulative Palermo scale rating at −2.77. The next good chance to observe the object will be in May 2028 when it passes from Earth.

Because of its very Earth-like orbit and because it would have been near the Earth in 1971 (coinciding with the Apollo program), there was speculation that might not be an asteroid but a man-made object such as an S-IVB booster stage from a Saturn V rocket which would make it about 15 meters in diameter and much less massive. (cf. J002E3, the S-IVB booster of Apollo 12 which was mistaken for an asteroid.)

== Possible impacts with Earth ==
Until December 2004, it was considered to have the highest (though still very low) likelihood of any near-Earth object to impact Earth in the next 100 years. It is ranked a zero on the Torino scale of impact risk because of its small size (the scale is 0–10) and is listed on Sentry Risk Table. It was briefly surpassed in December 2004 by 99942 Apophis (which at the time was known only by its provisional designation ). Smaller asteroids such as and have a greater chance of impacting Earth.

Based on 31 observations of made from May 1999 to October 2000, there is about a 1 in 360 chance that it will collide with Earth between 2069 and 2121. The greatest chance of impact is on 16 September 2071 with a 1 in 1000 chance of impact. Assuming the object is a rocky asteroid and that it reaches Earth&#x27;s surface without exploding in the atmosphere, the impact energy released would be an estimated 1.0 megatons of TNT, comparable to the Tunguska and Chelyabinsk events, which could create an impact crater approximately wide.

== Proposed NASA mission ==
In 2008, NASA considered this asteroid as a possible target for a crewed mission (Artemis 2) using the Orion spacecraft, prior to a projected 2030 push to Mars. Those plans were since abandoned. will be observable in May 2028 at an apparent magnitude of 19.

<doc id="1061554" wikidata="Q3650238" url="?curid=1061554" title="Dystrophic calcification">
<text>Dystrophic calcification (DC) is the calcification occurring in degenerated or necrotic tissue, as in hyalinized scars, degenerated foci in leiomyomas, and caseous nodules. This occurs as a reaction to tissue damage, including as a consequence of medical device implantation. Dystrophic calcification can occur even if the amount of calcium in the blood is not elevated, in contrast to metastatic calcification, which is a consequence of a systemic mineral imbalance, including hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia, that leads to calcium deposition in healthy tissues. In dystrophic calcification, basophilic calcium salt deposits aggregate, first in the mitochondria, then progressively throughout the cell. These calcifications are an indication of previous microscopic cell injury, occurring in areas of cell necrosis when activated phosphatases bind calcium ions to phospholipids in the membrane.

== Calcification in dead tissue==
#Caseous necrosis in T.B. is most common site of dystrophic calcification.
#Liquefactive necrosis in chronic abscesses may get calcified.
#Fat necrosis following acute pancreatitis or traumatic fat necrosis in breasts results in deposition of calcium soaps.
#Infarcts may undergo D.C.
#Thrombi, especially in veins, may produce phleboliths.
#Haematomas in the vicinity of bones may undergo D.C.
#Dead parasites like schistosoma eggs may calcify.
#Congenital toxoplasmosis, CMV or rubella may be seen on X-ray as calcifications in the brain.

== Calcification in degenerated tissue ==
#Dense scars may undergo hyaline degeneration and calcification.
#Atheroma in aorta and coronaries frequently undergo calcification.
#Cysts can show calcification.
#Calcinosis cutis is condition in which there are irregular nodular deposits of calcium salts in skin and subcutaneous tissue.
#Senile degenerative changes may be accompanied by calcification.
#The inherited disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum may lead to angioid streaks with calcification of Bruch&#x27;s membrane, the elastic tissue below the retinal ring.
