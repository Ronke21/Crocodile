<text>Brugg (sometimes written as Brugg AG in order to distinguish it from other &quot;Brugg&quot;s) is a Swiss municipality and a town in the canton of Aargau and is the seat of the district of the same name. The town is located at the confluence of the Aare, Reuss, and Limmat, with the Aare flowing through its medieval part. It is located approximately from the cantonal capital of Aarau; from Zürich; and about from Basel.

Brugg is the Swiss German term for bridge (). This is an allusion to the purpose of the medieval town&#x27;s establishment under the Habsburgs, as the town is located at the narrowest point on the Aare in the Swiss midlands. The Habsburgs’ oldest known residence is located in the neighborhood of Altenburg, which had previously been an independent community. Prior to their relocation to Austria, Brugg was the center of the Habsburgs&#x27; territory. Between 1415 and Napoleon’s invasion in 1798, Brugg was a subject territory of Bern. Since then it has belonged to the canton of Aargau.

The town is the home of the Swiss Farmers’ Union and is the location of a campus of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland. Brugg&#x27;s Vindonissa museum is listed as a heritage site of national significance. An engineer training unit of the Swiss army is also based in the town.

==Geography==
The municipality extends for six kilometers (4 mi.) from its southwestern to northeastern boundaries, and is barely wider than one kilometer (2/3 mi.) at its broadest point. The Aare, which flows through the centre of the old town, divides the municipality into two separate, distinct landscapes – the Swiss plateau on the southern bank and the beginnings of the Jura on the northern side.

The southwesternmost area of Brugg is primarily a flood plain, known as the &quot;Wildischachen&quot;, which is located between the Aare and a hill, the &quot;Wülpelsberg&quot;, upon which the Habsburg castle in the neighboring community of Habsburg was built. Approximately two kilometers (1.25 mi.) further north two separate branches of the Aare come together near the village of Altenburg. In between these two branches, which came into being following the construction of the hydroelectric power station Wildegg-Brugg, is the forested island of &quot;Schacheninsel&quot;.

Following a bend in the river, at which it alters its course from the north to the east, the river enters a 200-meter-long section with a rapids and a (650 ft) gorge. The Aare narrows from its previous width of about to a mere . It is along this gorge that the historic center of Brugg formed near the old bridge, with sections of the old town developing on both banks. Today the southern bank is heavily built up and is composed primarily of residential and industrial buildings, while the northern bank, due to the lack of space at the foot of the Bruggerberg (, is less settled.

The Aare broadens again after it exits the gorge and departs the old town, where it flows alongside the &quot;Aufeld&quot; plain. A majority of the population in this area is concentrated in a small band along the southeastern slope of the Bruggerberg. On the eastern border of the municipality three of the most important Swiss rivers flow together, first the Reuss and the Aare, the combination of which is met approximately further downstream by the Limmat. In the northeasternmost part of town, nestled between the mouth of the Limmat and the Reinerberg ( is the village of Lauffohr, which also is a part of Brugg.

Brugg has an area, , of . Of this area, or 13.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 28.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 50.2% is settled (buildings or roads), or 6.8% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.5% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 7.9% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 24.1% and transportation infrastructure made up 14.7%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 3.1%. 27.9% of the total land area was heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 8.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is pastures, while 1.1% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is in rivers and streams.

Brugg is bordered by the municipalities of Rüfenach and Villigen to the north; Untersiggenthal and Gebenstorf to the northeast; Windisch and Lupfig to the east; Hausen, Habsburg, Holderbank, and Veltheim to the south; Villnachern and Schinznach to the west; and Riniken and Bözberg to the northwest. Over time the built-up areas of Brugg have grown into the neighboring communities of Umiken and Windisch.

===Enlargement of the municipality===
Up until the 19th century Brugg consisted of only one-tenth of its current surface area. The municipality&#x27;s expansion began in 1823 with the purchase of around one-fourth of the territory of the neighboring community of Lauffohr. This was followed by the acquisition of a number of properties in 1827 from Umiken. Windisch sold the area around the train station in 1863 and transferred the land around the gas works in 1912. The village of Altenburg was incorporated into Brugg in 1901, and was followed in 1970 by the remainder of Lauffohr.

On 1 January 2010 the municipality of Umiken and on 1 January 2020 the municipality of Schinznach Bad merged into Brugg.


==History==

===Before the Municipality’s Establishment===
Archeological discoveries from the prehistoric era are scant. Two blades and fragments of a stone ax from the early Stone Age as well as a sickle from the Bronze Age are all that have been unearthed.

In 58 BC, or shortly thereafter, the Helvetii, who had returned to the Swiss Plateau following the Battle of Bibracte, (re-)founded the settlement of Vindonissa on a hill between the Aare and Reuss on what is today territory of the neighboring community of Windisch.

The Romans constructed a military post at Vindonissa around 15 BC, which they expanded into an encampment of a Roman Legion. At this time the first wooden bridge over the Aare was built as part of a Roman road across the Jura mountains to Augusta Raurica (known today as Augst). It was the only position along the Aare between Lake Thun and the Rhine at which the river could be crossed with a single log. Remains of around 350 Roman graves have since been discovered within Brugg, where two large Roman burial grounds were located, and archeologists estimate that a total of 7,000 graves exist.
After the invasion of the Alemanni between 259 and 270 AD the Romans converted Vindonissa back into a camp of a Roman Legion, breaking with a 170-year &quot;civilian phase.&quot; Around 370 AD the Romans established a fort as part of the Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes-System in Altenburg. The Romans, though, ultimately withdrew between the years 401 and 406 AD. Settlement of the Alemanni in their stead has been traced to the 7th century. The toponymy is first recorded as &quot;Bruggo&quot; (Latin) in 1064.

In the late 10th century a noble dynasty under Lanzelin, which was possibly related to the Alsatian Etichonids, settled in Altenburg. He expanded the established Roman fort into the Altenburg Castle and made it his seat. Around 1020 Lanzelin&#x27;s son, Radbot, ordered the construction of the Habsburg Castle approximately three kilometers to the southwest on the Wülpelsberg in the modern town of Habsburg. A few decades later the royal house adopted the castle&#x27;s name as its own. Consequently, Altenburg is the first verifiable residence of the Habsburgs. With the acquisition of this territory between the Aare and Reuss, known as the &quot;Eigenamt,&quot; the Habsburgs established the steppingstone of their imperium.

===Habsburg Rule===
The earliest documented use of the name &quot;Bruggo&quot; has been dated to the year 1064, when Count Werner I attested to the possession of goods on the part of Muri Abbey in the area. The exact date, however, is contentious, as the &quot;Acta Murensia&quot; was first drawn up in 1160 and included a number of various older documents. Between 1164 and 1174 the place was mentioned as &quot;Brucca&quot; and between 1227 and 1234 as &quot;Brukke&quot;. At the end of the 12th century the Black Tower, or &quot;Schwarze Turm&quot;, was constructed at the behest of Count Albrecht III, Werner II&#x27;s son. The Black Tower is the oldest standing structure remaining in Brugg&#x27;s old town today.
During the 13th century the settlement at the fortified river crossing took on the characteristics of a small town. Coins were minted from 1232, while a toll post was established in 1273. The town had a mayor, or &quot;Schultheiss&quot;, by 1278 and the first mention of a market can be traced to 1283. The importance of Brugg to the Habsburg can be seen in their decision to relocate to the town between 1220 and 1230. The confines of the Habsburg Castle had become too small for the family members that lived there. In 1242 the town is said to have been plundered by supporters of the Habsburg&#x27;s Laufenburg Line.

Rudolf I, who spent a great deal of time in Brugg before his election to King of the Romans, awarded Brugg city rights, or &quot;Stadtrecht&quot;, on 23 July 1284. The decree awarding this new status was identical, word for word, to that of the town of Aarau. At the same time Brugg was granted independence from the Eigenamt and became a separate polity. Although the Habsburgs had moved their center of power a few years earlier to Vienna, they continued to maintain close ties with Brugg. The &quot;Austrian House,&quot; later known as &quot;Effingerhof,&quot; served as accommodations and a headquarters during military conflicts throughout this period of time in the Austrian forelands.
On 1 May 1308 King Albrecht I was murdered by his nephew John Parricida in the neighboring community of Windisch. In memory of this event his wife, Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol, founded Königsfelden Abbey (Cloister of King&#x27;s Field), a Franciscan monastery and Clarisse convent, in 1310–11 at the site – approximately 200 meters from Brugg. Albrecht&#x27;s oldest daughter, Agnes of Hungary, the widow of the Hungarian King Andrew III, moved to Königsfelden in 1317 and led it to commercial success, but did not join a religious order. In 1348 she received the sovereign rights to Brugg as well as the neighboring districts of Bözberg (including Lauffohr) and the Eigenamt (including Altenburg) from her brother Duke Albrecht II. These rights lapsed after her death in 1364.

Although the town was under Habsburg control, there were still the beginnings of an independent polity. In the 1350s Brugg agreed to association, or &quot;Burgrecht&quot;, treaties with Baden and Mellingen (1351) and with the Cloister of Wittichen in the upper Kinzig Valley (1353). The departments of Bözburg and Eigenamt, upon their reversion of Habsburg control in 1364, also fell under the military leadership of the town. During this time the Austrians regularly assembled their armed forces in Brugg, as Duke Leopold III did in 1386 prior to the Battle of Sempach.

===Conquest and Conflict===
Frederick IV fell into disregard at the Council of Constance in 1415, after he assisted the flight of the opposition Pope John XXIII. In response, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund requested the Swiss to take control of Aargau. Bern did not hesitate and dispatched troops at once. The residents of Brugg did not resist the invaders and allowed them to enter the town unopposed. In return Bern left the town alone.

The town and the Eigenamt, in turn, found themselves in the northeasternmost section of Bern&#x27;s subject territories, known as Bernese Aargau. At the same time, the Habsburgs relinquished control of Schenkenberg, originally in the district of Bözberg, to creditors they had pledged the territory to following their loss in the Battle of Sempach. This left Brugg in a predicament as its periphery and forest on the Bruggerburg along the northern bank of the Aare remained outside of the jurisdiction of Bern. Brugg was therefore required to consult regularly with the rulers of Schenkenberg concerning its northern territory.
King Frederick III of the House of Habsburg joined with Zürich in 1443 in the Old Zürich War and demanded the return of his Argovian territories. The residents of Brugg expected an economic boost upon the return of the Habsburgs and were therefore sympathetic to Zürich&#x27;s cause. Brugg&#x27;s location at the edge of Bern&#x27;s territory had led to a substantial economic slowdown in town. As Zürich was besieged by troops from the other Swiss cantons, French King Charles VII dispatched Armagnac mercenaries to the conflict region to aid Zürich. To assist in their advance towards the town, Brugg was attacked on the night of the 29th / 30 July 1444. A small band led by Baron Thomas von Falkenstein sneaked down the Bruggerberg and forced its way through town, ransacking homes and setting a number of them ablaze. Many citizens were kidnapped in the ensuing chaos and held for ransom.

Although the ordeal did not cause many deaths, it was nonetheless characterized as a downright massacre by Zürich&#x27;s opponents and subsequently referred to as the &quot;Brugg Night of Murder&quot; (&quot;Brugger Mordnacht&quot;). In retaliation, forces from Bern and Solothurn attacked and destroyed Falkenstein&#x27;s family seat near Niedergösgen. Meanwhile, the Armagnac&#x27;s advance was halted at the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs on 26 August 1444, making the raid on Brugg militarily insignificant. On 5 September 1445 troops from Zürich launched another assault on Brugg, but their raid was detected at an early stage and consequently repelled, whereupon they pillaged surrounding villages.

In 1451, Thüring of Aarburg sold Schenkenberg to Hans and Markwart of Baldegg. The new rulers and Brugg soon found themselves in conflict with one another over Brugg&#x27;s right to use the Bruggerberg. The Baldeggs, who had demonstratively aligned themselves with the Austrians, considered their territory on the northern bank of the Aare to be their personal property and took offense at the town&#x27;s claims upon it. By 1460, Bern had had enough of the constant harassment of its subject town and seized the dominion.

All residents of Brugg were thereafter subjects of Bern. Nonetheless, this changed little on the outskirts of town, as Bern&#x27;s border had been pushed to the north by only a few kilometers, and conflict continued to impair the town&#x27;s economy. During the eighty years subsequent to the &quot;Brugg Night of Murder&quot; the population of Brugg was halved and surrounding communities were able to expand their trading areas and markets at the expense of Brugg.

===Subject Territory of Bern===
Brugg was granted the special status of &quot;municipal town&quot; (&quot;Munizipalstadt&quot;) in Bern. It was therefore not subject to another, intermediary sovereign, or &quot;Landvogtei&quot;, and possessed more autonomy than other comparable towns.

At the head of Brugg&#x27;s government at this time sat two mayors, called &quot;Schultheiss&quot;, each of whom served two-year, alternating terms as chair. Together with seven further individuals they made up the &quot;Small City Council,&quot; which undertook various administrative tasks. Below them stood the &quot;Large Council,&quot; which was composed of twelve members. It was expected to keep the Small Council in check. Both councils were selected from among the thirty-two-member &quot;Kleinglocke&quot; (literally &quot;Small Bell&quot;), members of which were named by the Small Council. This meant that unwanted candidates had no chance of assuming higher office, other than through the use of bribes. These councils were therefore exclusive, with a small number of influential members of the community sharing these lucrative posts among one another. Meanwhile, the disempowered citizenry possessed only the right to elect the town&#x27;s priest and the town&#x27;s open assembly, the &quot;&quot;Maiding&quot;,&quot; was purely symbolic.
In January 1528, Bern decided to introduce reforms to religious institutions and, therewith, join the Reformation. Referendums were held in all towns and &quot;Landvogteien&quot;. The areas surrounding Brugg voted in favor of breaking with the Catholic Church, while the town itself voted by a majority of five to remain Catholic. Brugg was nonetheless isolated in this desire and ultimately caved in to Bern under massive political pressure.

The town&#x27;s school, in existence since at least 1396, was consequently converted into a state-administered Latin school. It served primarily as a preparatory school for students bound for the theological academy in the city of Bern. It was supported financially by the income of the now-disbanded Kloster Königsfelden. The school itself produced an above-average number of priests and scholars, which led many to label Brugg the &quot;Prophet Town&quot; (&quot;Prophetenstadt&quot;).

Despite its subject status, the town repeatedly tried to expand its own influence into the surrounding area. It had, for instance, possessed the patronage of the church in Mönthal since the 13th century. In 1588 Johann Georg von Hallwyl, later Bishop of Basel, sold two-thirds of the parishes of Bözberg and Rein to the town, as well as one third of the lower jurisdiction (&quot;niedere Gerichtsbarkeit&quot;) in Villnachern. Brugg also acquired Trostburg in the Wynental from the Hallwyls in 1616. Bern, however, refused to tolerate this gradual expansion of power on the part of its subject territory and ultimately took possession of the titles itself.

During an epidemic of the plague in 1541 around 180 people died, a total of one fourth of the town&#x27;s residents. By 1611 the population climbed to a peak of 930, reaching a level not seen in two hundred years. The last and severest of plague epidemics struck in September 1667 and lingered until January 1669, during which time 514, over 60 percent of the population, perished. An accident of note occurred on 1 September 1626, when a ship on its way to Zurzach capsized on the Aare. Over 100 people, included 47 from Brugg, drowned in the incident. It was only in 1840 that the town&#x27;s population returned to that of 1611.
Artisanry and craftsmanship were predominant trades at this point in Brugg&#x27;s history. They catered primarily to the needs of the surrounding area and, along with the increasing expansion of transportation routes, to travelers. This was particularly so after the construction of a road over the Bözberg Pass between 1773 and 1779. No guilds of any political significance existed in town at this time. In the 18th century the salt trade grew in importance. The Salt House (&quot;Salzhaus&quot;), constructed in 1732, was one of the largest salt depots in the Swiss Confederation. It supplied not only Bernese Aargau, but the neighboring districts of the Freie Ämter (Free Bailiwicks) and County of Baden as well.

After the beginning of the French Revolution, demands for equality and rights found a great deal of support in town. As the French proceeded through Swiss territory and the end of Bern&#x27;s rule drew near at the beginning of 1798, a revolutionary committee seized power. On 12 April 1798 General Guillaume Marie Anne Brune proclaimed the Helvetic Republic.

===The Nineteenth Century===

Under the centralized government of the Helvetic Republic cantons were purely administrative entities, which were in turn divided into districts and municipalities. Brugg thus lost all of its previously privileges and became a district capital in the canton of Aargau.

The revolutionary atmosphere that had followed the declaration of the Helvetic Republic dissipated rapidly in 1799. Responsible for this sudden shift was the War of the Second Coalition, during which the battlefront ran directly through the Aare Valley and hundreds of French soldiers were quartered in houses in the town. When the French withdrew from Switzerland for a number of months in 1802, the supporters of the old order had the upper hand. During the ensuing &quot;Stecklikrieg&quot; farmers from the surrounding area plundered the town&#x27;s armory. Following the Act of Mediation, signed by Napoléon Bonaparte on 19 March 1803, Brugg was definitively made a district capital in the newly arranged canton of Aargau.

At the beginning of the 19th century Brugg became a stronghold of Liberalism and its politicians played a leading role in the development of the new canton. In an outward symbol of this break from the past the town&#x27;s moat was filled in 1811, followed by the destruction of its fortifications between 1829 and 1840. The steep incline of the &quot;Hauptstrasse&quot;, the most important thoroughfare through the old town, hindered transportation and was therefore leveled in 1836 under the supervision of the later-renowned engineer Alois Negrelli. In 1823 Brugg reached an agreement with Lauffohr to purchase about one-fourth of Lauffohr&#x27;s territory for the sum of 1,669 Swiss Francs. Four years later, in 1827, the town purchased a tract of land near the Brunnenmühle from Umiken in the vicinity of the &quot;Vorstadt&quot; and, in return, agreed to abstain from its right to wood and fields in the &quot;Umiker Schachen.&quot;

The initially positive outlook held by the town when it came to facing the challenges posed by the modern gave way to a more conservative mindset. In turn, the residents of Brugg concentrated primarily on their supposed strengths – handicraft, artisanry and trade. At this time the town lacked the political will and commitment necessary for the development of industry. Brugg&#x27;s bourgeoisie was particularly prejudiced against factory workers. This hesitation benefited neighboring communities such as Windisch and Turgi, where large textile factories emerged.
The &quot;Schweizerische Nordostbahn&quot; expanded its Zürich-Baden line to Brugg on 29 September 1856, and the cantonal capital of Aarau on 15 May 1858. The expansion of the railroad initially hurt the town&#x27;s economy, as the road over the Bözberg Pass was replaced by rail and the businesses serving these travelers lost their clientele. Brugg also found fault with the location of the train station, which was built ten minutes from the town itself. Windisch, on the other hand, complained about the fact that stationed was named for Brugg despite actually being located on its territory.

The cause of this conflict was the complex border between the two towns. Brugg had only possessed a thin strip of land, known as the &quot;Burgerziel,&quot; around the town&#x27;s old wall. To the south of this was the &quot;Ehfäde,&quot; which was agricultural land located in a special district owned entirely by citizens of Brugg. Although all changes in ownership had to be approved by Brugg, the land was politically and taxably part of Windisch. The town had repeatedly attempted to acquire the territory, but to no avail. In 1856 the cantonal government found that the situation was no longer appropriate and awarded control of the Ehfäde to Windisch. Windisch, however, was in a difficult fiscal position and found itself in need of funds. In 1863 they agreed to sell the land, where the train station was located, to Brugg for 25,000 Swiss Francs.
With the construction of additional rail lines Brugg became an important rail junction. The &quot;Bözbergbahn&quot; to Basel opened on 2 August 1875, while the &quot;Aargauische Südbahn&quot; commissioned its line to Hendschiken on 1 June 1882. Despite these excellent transit links and the availability of land, industrial development was still slow to take root. In 1864 a printing press opened on the site of the &quot;Effingerhof,&quot; the former town residence of the Habsburgs, which necessitated its demolition. Another prominent building, the &quot;Hallwylerfestung&quot; (Hallwyler Fortress), was torn down in 1883 and replaced with a schoolhouse. 1882 saw the development of a new water system and, beginning in 1896, a sewage system.

The town&#x27;s military tradition began in 1848 when an engineer corps was deployed to Brugg. It initially exercised in the old town and was accommodated in private homes. Following numerous complaints from residents, the cantonal government decided to convert the grain house (&quot;Kornhaus&quot;) into barracks in 1856. Between 1876 and 1878 an exercise grounds was constructed near the &quot;Geissenschachen,&quot; followed by a new barracks complex in 1898.

===The Twentieth Century===
The breakthrough in industrial development came about in 1892 with the commissioning of the town&#x27;s electric plant (in operation until 1952). Within a few years a large number of industrial firms settled in town and Brugg experienced an economic boom. The town, however, soon found itself bumping against its small borders. Meanwhile, between 1898 and 1901, the canton of Aargau forcibly merged twelve smaller communities against their will, as they no longer appeared to be economically viable as independent entities and could therefore not meet their legally prescribed duties and responsibilities. Altenburg found itself among this group. Although the final vote in the town meeting came down firmly against its cessation of independence (42 against versus 2 in favor), the Grand Council approved of its incorporation into Brugg on 1 January 1901. Brugg thus saw its surface area doubled.
Agriculture had never played a significant role in the town&#x27;s economy, but various circumstances led to the rise of Brugg as the &quot;Farmers Metropolis&quot; (&quot;&quot;Bauernmetropole&quot;) at the start of the 20th century. The &quot;Landwirtschaftliche Winterschule&quot;,&quot; a training institute for farmers, was opened in 1887 and moved into a new building on &quot;Baslerstrasse&quot; in 1901. The selection of Brugg as the seat of the Swiss Farmers&#x27; Union (&quot;Schweizerischer Bauernverband&quot;) was purely coincidental: The wife of the Union&#x27;s husband was from Brugg and did not want to move. The Union itself was therefore relocated to Brugg from Bern. The small farmers secretariat developed over time into one of the largest special interest groups in Switzerland. Cattle trade also emerged as an important industry following the completion of the railroad. The Market Hall (&quot;Markthalle&quot;) evolved into one of the most important national transshipment hubs by 1930. The cattle market was ultimately shut in 1997 and moved to Brunegg.

Catholics, whose portion of the population rose greatly due to the arrival of factory workers, were allowed to build their own church in 1907, about 400 years after the Reformation and Brugg&#x27;s subsequent conversion to Protestantism. In 1911 the town&#x27;s gas work was brought online (closure in 1967) on territory ceded to Brugg from Windisch at no cost. The economic boom came to an end during World War I, during which many residents were forced to live under the subsistence level. During the National Strike (&quot;Landesstreik&quot;) in 1918 strikes impacted all factories in town. The global economic depression also hit Brugg hard, contributing to high unemployment and the closing of a number of businesses. Under the influence of the Nazi seizure of power in Germany in 1933, there were multiple demonstrations and counterdemonstrations organized by the National Front and opposition groups in town, which drew up to 3,000 participants at their peak. From 1935 until 1939 there was an active NSDAP organization in town, the members of which, though, were all German laborers.

After the constraints and restrictions of World War II, the town entered another period of rapid economic growth that lasted three decades. The almost-euphoric economic expansion led to plans for disproportionate and oversized development projects, most of which were never realized. For example: The construction of a four-lane highway and the urban renewal and reconfiguration of the area to the south of the old town. An inland water transport port with two basins in Aufeld was also envisioned as part of a plan to make the High Rhine and the Aare navigable.

A contentious political issue during the 1960s was the incorporation of Lauffohr into Brugg. Over two-thirds of the residents of Lauffohr lived in the rapidly growing neighborhood of Au. It bordered directly on Brugg and was separated from the center of Lauffohr by a large, undeveloped swath of land. The residents of Au gravitated towards Brugg and therefore strived for the fusion of the two communities. A referendum was held in September 1962, with 97 individuals voting for, and 64 voting against, the merger of the two municipalities. Brugg, however, was not overly enthusiastic about the possible fusion – 494 voted in favor, while 409 voted against the proposal. The narrow vote and the strong weight placed upon the independence of communities at the time moved the cantonal parliament not to recognize the results of the referendum. In August 1965, all of the seats in the Lauffohr town council were won by supporters of the fusion and the matter remained topical. In April 1969, another round of referendums was held. In Brugg the final tally was 1095 in favor and 397 against, while the result in Lauffohr was much closer – 113 in favor and 100 against. Meanwhile, the cantonal parliament&#x27;s position on town mergers had changed during the intervening years and it confirmed the results. The fusion ultimately occurred on 1 January 1970.

The 1973 oil crisis resulted in structural changes in the economy and the further development of the service sector. Companies such as Georg Fischer AG moved their production facilities, while others such as Traugott Simmen AG (the most-renowned furniture producer in Switzerland in the 1950s and 1960s) were sold off or shut down. The crisis also killed off the high-flying plans of the economic boom. Only the shopping centers &quot;Neumarkt I&quot; and &quot;Neumarkt II&quot; – opening in 1975 and 1982, respectively – and the &quot;Middle Bypass&quot; (&quot;&quot;Mittlere Umfahrung&quot;), which was completed in 1980 and relieved the old town from traffic, were actually realized.

===Twenty-first century===

Brugg&#x27;s transition to an important seat of higher education began at the end of the 1950s. In 1958 the &quot;Landwirtschaftliche Winterschule&quot; relocated to Gränichen and was replaced by the &quot;Frauenschule&quot; – the Women&#x27;s School. The new school trained future instructors of home economics and needlework along with prospective kindergarten teachers. Over time it developed into the &quot;Lehrerseminar&quot; (1973), Teaching Institute, and finally the &quot;Pädagogische Fachhochschule&quot; (2001), or College of Education – both of which trained future teachers. Meanwhile, the cantonal technical college was opened in neighboring Windisch. Both institutions were then merged into the &quot;Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz&quot;, or the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland in English. Currently being developed, the project &quot;Vision Mitte&quot;&quot; envisions the construction of a new, unified campus by the year 2010 on the Brugg-Windish border, at which the various departments – currently in different locations – would be based in one location, and which would educate upwards of 2,500 students.

Brugg, however, could not use its location to its advantage in the healthcare sector. The cantonal government announced the closure of the district hospital in September 2003 due to financial constraints. The announcement was met with indignation and resistance, the bulk of which culminated in a demonstration that was attended by over 6,000 people in February 2005 – by far the largest demonstration in Brugg&#x27;s history. The cantonal parliament authorized the closure regardless and converted the hospital into a nursing home, which resulted in the elimination of 300 jobs. The hospital&#x27;s closure marked the end of a long tradition of medical care in Brugg, which began in 1450 with the opening of the &quot;Heiliggeistspital&quot;, or Holy Spirit hospital.

That Brugg and Windisch have grown into one another, along with the close cooperation necessary for the realization of the project &quot;Vision Mitte&quot;, led to calls for the merger of the two communities. Both town councils voted strongly in favor of an initiative to launch negotiations for such a fusion in May 2006. A referendum, however, was launched in opposition to this decision. Voting was held on 24 September 2006, the results of which showed a clear majority of the electorate – 63 percent – opposed to such a merger. There were two reasons, above all, for this opposition: the large difference between the tax rates of the communities and the debt held by the municipality of Windisch. For these reasons discussion of a merger is not likely to arise again before the completion of the &quot;Vision Mitte&quot; campus.

Unaffected by this decision is Brugg&#x27;s fusion with Umiken. The town council (&quot;Stadtrat&quot; ) ordered a study on a possible merger, the results of which were presented in March 2007 and were positively received. The resident&#x27;s council (&quot;Einwohnerrat&quot; ) approved the merger agreement on 27 July 2008. A referendum in favor passed on 28 September 2008 in both Brugg – with 88.6 voting &quot;yes&quot; (1,748 to 224) – and Umiken – with 85.7 percent voting yes (330 to 55). The merger was scheduled to occur on 1 January 2010.

==Points of interest==

===Heritage sites of national significance===
The &quot;Schlössli Altenburg&quot; (a late-Roman and medieval castle), the former &quot;Lateinschule&quot;, the Swiss Reformed City Church, the &quot;Schwarzer Turm&quot; (Black tower), the Vindonissa-Museum, and Zimmermannhaus (Carpenter House) are listed as Swiss heritage sites of national significance.

===The Old Town===

Brugg&#x27;s old town developed along a narrow gorge of the Aare and is divided into two parts – one on each bank. The section on the southern bank is by far the largest. Shaped like a bell, it is located on a sloping hillside. The smaller periphery on the northern bank is located at the foot of the Bruggerberg. Almost all of the old town&#x27;s buildings are constructed from shell limestone. Only portions of the town&#x27;s defensive structures remain in existence. Different fragments have been integrated into the town&#x27;s modern structures and have been broken through with windows and passageways in many sections. Of the town&#x27;s towers only the &quot;Archivturm&quot; (Archive Tower) and the lower half of the &quot;Storchenturm&quot; (Stork Tower) on the western side along with the &quot;Eckturm&quot; (Corner Tower) on the northern side of the town&#x27;s north-bank periphery remain.

The town&#x27;s oldest building and landmark, the &quot;Schwarze Turm&quot; (Black Tower), is a 25.7-meter high tower-castle. This bridgehead is partially constructed from remains of the Roman Legion post Vindonissa and was expanded several meters higher in 1535. The town&#x27;s late-gothic town hall (&quot;Rathaus&quot;) was added onto it in 1579. The tower was used as the regions prison from 1846 until November 2006.

Brugg&#x27;s reformed church is the seat of the regional church district. The oldest remaining section, a tower integrated into the town&#x27;s former defenses, was completed around 1220. Between 1479 and 1518, the building was expanded in four stages in late-gothic style with three naves, a side chapel, and a choir. The interior layout originates from 1641 to 1642. Its modern exterior design was shaped between 1734 and 1740, when it was completely remodeled in baroque style. New windows emblazoned with the crests of the older family houses of Brugg were installed in 1896.

Directly next to the church stands the Latin school. Its three-story building, finished in a baroque style and completed around 1638–40, is also a part of the town&#x27;s defenses, with its back wall integrated into the town&#x27;s defensive barrier. The front façade is covered by a brilliant and rare humanistic mural of allegorical female figures representing theology and the seven liberal arts (grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The cartouches under the window ledges are adorned with Biblical dictums in German, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

In the southeastern area of the old town is the Hofstatt, the town&#x27;s only large open square. The &quot;Zeughaus&quot; (Armory), completed in 1673, is located on the square&#x27;s northern side. The baroque structure stands out into the alley with its protruding tower topped by a bulbous dome (an architectural design that is rarely encountered in the German-speaking section of Switzerland). The southern side of the Hofstatt is flanked by the dominant &quot;Salzhaus&quot; (Salt House), which was completed in 1732, and was used to store salt until the middle of the 19th century. Other than the attic space, the building is composed entirely of one large room with twelve supporting pillars.

Most of the old town&#x27;s homes have been simply maintained. They originate primarily from the period between the sixteenth and 18th centuries and were constructed in gothic as well as baroque styles (some with rococo ornamentation). Mentionable are the &quot;Bürgerasyl&quot;, a hospital completed in 1747; the &quot;Landschreiberei der Vogtei Schenkenberg&quot; (Registry of the Bailiwick of Schenkenberg) completed in 1606; the &quot;Kornhaus&quot; (Grain House) completed in 1697; the house &quot;Roter Bären&quot; (Of the Red Bear) completed in 1750; and the house &quot;Hirschen&quot; (Deer), which was constructed around the year 1750. The &quot;Zimmermannhaus&quot; (Carpenter House) on the northern bank is also worth mention and is partially of neo-classical design.

===Beyond the Old Town===

At the southern end of the old town is the &quot;Rotes Haus&quot; (Red House), an inn that has been in existence since the 16th century. It was expanded greatly in 1840 at the expense of the &quot;Obertorturm&quot; – the town&#x27;s second landmark and a section of the town&#x27;s defenses – which was demolished to make way.

The first building in Brugg to be constructed beyond the town&#x27;s wall was the &quot;Stadthaus&quot; (Town House), also known as the &quot;Palais Frölich&quot;. It was built at the behest of Johann Jakob Frölich, who acquired his wealth through his service as private secretary to Earl Sandwich. The baroque building, which is topped by a mansard roof, is adorned by baroque elements internally as well as externally. It has been the seat of the town&#x27;s administration and council since 1909. To the west of the building is the &quot;Stadtpark&quot; (Town Park) with two abutting neo-classical office complexes.

There are a number of other noteworthy buildings in the direct vicinity of the &quot;Stadthaus&quot;. The &quot;Haus Rauber&quot; is the only neo-classical cottage in Brugg. It was built in 1822 according to the plans of Architect Hans Conrad Stadler. The &quot;Schilplinhaus&quot; was completed in 1810 during the late phase of rococo architecture and was acquired by the &quot;Schweizerischer Bauernverband&quot; (Swiss Farmers’ Union / Association) in 1928. The &quot;House of the Swiss Farmer&quot; (&quot;Haus des Schweizerbauern&quot;), a large administrative building, was constructed on the location of the Schilplinhaus&#x27; barn. The town&#x27;s Catholic house of worship – the St. Nikolaus Church – was named after the town&#x27;s one-time patron saint, Saint Nicholas. It was constructed in 1905 according to the plans of Adolf Gaudy in a neo-baroque style and was completely renovated in 1952.

Located about one kilometer to the west of the old town, in Altenburg, on top of a crag is the small castle &quot;Schlössli Altenburg,&quot; which was constructed on the ruins of a Roman fort during medieval times and was the first residence of the Habsburgs. Integrated into the western wall of the tower house is the highest remaining Roman wall in Switzerland, the construction material of which comes primarily from the 16th century. It has served as a hostel since 1943.

The industrial heritage path (&quot;Industriekulturpfad&quot;) Limmat-Wasserschloss is a trail towards Wettingen, which passes by forty-four different industrial buildings. Structures in Brugg along this trail include the Altenburger railway bridge, the former electric power station, Brugg&#x27;s train station, a number of different plants of the Kabelwerke Brugg, and the town&#x27;s decommissioned gas plant.

==Coat of arms==

The blazon of the town&#x27;s coat of arms is: &quot;On a white field a black bridge, guarded by two roofed black towers, the right one higher and with a covered machicolation&quot; (&quot;In Weiss schwarze Brücke, bewehrt mit zwei bedachten schwarzen Türmen, der rechte höher und mit bedachter Pechnase&quot;).

The symbol of the town is reproduced on the coat of arms – the large black tower on the right as well as the smaller toll tower on the left bank of the Aare linked by the bridge in between. It is worth noting that the machicolation mentioned in the blazon is really an oriel without any specified function, while the toll tower was removed in 1836.

The oldest known depiction is on the town seal from 1311. A number of changes to the coat of arms followed. These corresponded to structural alterations made to the buildings and the bridge that were replicated with great care to detail, as can be seen on the depiction to the left. With time multiple versions came into simultaneous use. In 1964 the town council (&quot;Stadtrat&quot;) decided to standardize the coat. One year later the emblem received its modern form.

The town colors are black and white. The coat of arms is also used, unchanged, as the district&#x27;s emblem.

==Demographics==
The population of Brugg, including that of Altenburg after 1830 and Lauffohr after 1970

Brugg has a population () of . , 26.3% of the population are foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1997–2007) the population has changed at a rate of 0.4%. Most of the population () speaks German (83.8%), with Italian being second most common ( 2.9%) and Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian being third ( 2.4%).

The percentage of residents that are not Swiss citizens is approximately six percent above the cantonal average of 19.3 percent. Between 1850 and 1950 the total number of such residents held steady at about 300 persons. The following twenty-year period saw a fivefold increase in their numbers, followed by a twenty-year period of stagnation. From 1990 onwards the number of non-citizens rose again. Among the town&#x27;s unnaturalized residents, citizens from Serbia-Montenegro (around 5.2 percent of the total population) predominate, followed by Italians (3.9 percent), Turks (2.8 percent) and Germans (1.9 percent).

The age distribution, , in Brugg is; 781 children or 8.5% of the population are between 0 and 9 years old and 965 teenagers or 10.5% are between 10 and 19. Of the adult population, 1,287 people or 14.0% of the population are between 20 and 29 years old. 1,229 people or 13.4% are between 30 and 39, 1,370 people or 14.9% are between 40 and 49, and 1,292 people or 14.1% are between 50 and 59. The senior population distribution is 1,056 people or 11.5% of the population are between 60 and 69 years old, 709 people or 7.7% are between 70 and 79, there are 404 people or 4.4% who are between 80 and 89, and there are 93 people or 1.0% who are 90 and older.

 the average number of residents per living room was 0.55 which is about equal to the cantonal average of 0.57 per room. In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 37.9% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement). , there were 413 homes with 1 or 2 persons in the household, 2,186 homes with 3 or 4 persons in the household, and 1,155 homes with 5 or more persons in the household. The average number of people per household was 2.20 individuals. there were 1,053 single family homes (or 23.7% of the total) out of a total of 4,439 homes and apartments. There were a total of 32 empty apartments for a 0.7% vacancy rate. , the construction rate of new housing units was 1.2 new units per 1000 residents.

In Brugg about 74.9% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;). Of the school age population (), there are 620 students attending primary school, there are 294 students attending secondary school, there are 304 students attending tertiary or university level schooling in the municipality.

===Religion===
From the , 3,054 or 33.4% were Roman Catholic, while 3,723 or 40.7% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. Of the rest of the population, there were 13 individuals (or about 0.14% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic faith.

In 1900 a large majority of the population, approximately 83 percent, was Protestant. The portion of the population identifying itself as a Catholic grew greatly after 1950, partially due to the migration of labor from Catholic regions within Switzerland, but primarily from Mediterranean countries. Today less than half of the population of the one-time &quot;Prophet City&quot; (&quot;Prophetenstadt&quot;) is Protestant.

==Politics==
===Legislative===
In lieu of a town meeting, the &quot;Einwohnerrat&quot; (residents&#x27; council) has represented the wishes of its electorate since 1965. The council is composed of 50 members and is empowered to authorize all decisions relevant to the town&#x27;s tax rate, budget, annual report, and credit. It can also pass regulations. All members of the council are chosen for four-year terms through a proportional-representation-based electoral process.

===Executive===
The executive branch of government is the &quot;Stadtrat&quot; (town council). It leads and represents the political community. Members are elected by all enfranchised residents of Brugg to four-year terms though a majoritarian system. The town council is responsible for the implementation of all resolutions approved by the resident&#x27;s council (&quot;Einwohnerrat&quot;) and is obliged to carry out all tasks assigned to it by the cantonal and federal governments.

The five members of the town council for the term 2018–2021 are as follows:
* Barbara Horlacher (GPS), mayor
* Leo Geissmann (CVP)
* Willi Däpp (SP)
* Jürg Baur (CVP)
* Reto Wettstein (FDP)

===Judicial===
The District Court of Brugg is responsible for legal disputes. A justice of the peace also exists at the communal level and serves the municipalities of Riniken, Umiken and Villnachern as well.

===Direct Democratic===
Different direct-democratic mechanisms also exist at the municipal level, including voluntary, i.e., petitioner-based, and obligatory, i.e., statutory-based, referendums, as well as the right to initiate independent initiatives. As in the rest of Switzerland, the electorate has the final say over almost all municipal matters.

==Economy==
, Brugg had an unemployment rate of 2.68%. , there were 62 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 12 businesses involved in this sector. 2,134 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 104 businesses in this sector. 5,000 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 539 businesses in this sector.

 there was a total of 4,595 workers who lived in the municipality. Of these, 3,026 or about 65.9% of the residents worked outside Brugg while 5,650 people commuted into the municipality for work. There were a total of 7,219 jobs (of at least 6 hours per week) in the municipality. Of the working population, 27.1% used public transportation to get to work, and 37.7% used a private car.

From 1920 onwards (when such data was first kept) industry has provided about half of all jobs. Its share shrank to one quarter in the early 1970s due to structural changes in the economy. Agriculture, on the other hand, has traditionally played a marginal role. More than a third of all jobs in the district are concentrated in the town of Brugg, which in turn causes a marked stream of commuters to and from the community. Over 70 percent of all jobs are held by commuters.
The Kabelwerke Brugg is a global company specialised in the areas of cable systems, wire ropes, piping systems, and process control engineering. The company has over 1,300 employees and was named after the town, where it was founded. It has its seat in Brugg and is represented in 16 countries worldwide. Tütschi Fluid AG, also located in town, is a leading producer of water and chemical pumps. Other important businesses include Jost Brugg AG (electric installation) along with the paper and printing firms Seetal Schaller AG and Effingerhof AG.

In addition to these larger firms there are around 650 small- and mid-sized employers. Nationally known are the Internet service provider green.ch and publisher BEA + Poly-Verlag. The shopping centers Neumarket I and Neumarkt II (New Market I and New Market II), both of which are located near the train station, are important meeting points in the region, with some of the highest recorded revenue per sq meter in Switzerland. Brugg is also the seat of the Swiss Farmers&#x27; Union (&quot;Schweizerischer Bauernverband &quot;) and the Rural Women&#x27;s Guild / Union (&quot;Schweizerischer Landfrauenverband&quot;). A barrack of the Swiss army is also an important employer. The local radio station, Radio Argovia, broadcast from its Brugg-based studio from 1990 until its move to Aarau in 2005.

==Transportation==

Brugg is an important crossroads. Two national highways meet in town, A3 motorway (Basel – Zürich – Chur) and A5 motorway (Lausanne – Biel/Bienne – Waldshut). Access to the A3 is located four kilometers south, between Hausen and Lupfig. There is also access to A1 motorway a further four kilometers to the south in the town of Mägenwil. Through traffic in town is no longer directed into the old town; instead, it is led around it on the &quot;Mittlere Umfahrung&quot;, or intermediary bypass, which is composed of a tunnel under the town&#x27;s cemetery and the Casino Bridge over the Aare.

Brugg AG railway station is located at a junction of three separate Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) lines. The most important of these is the Bözberg line between Zürich and Basel. The other, less-traveled lines pass through the Aare Valley towards Aarau and through the Birrfeld (Birr field) towards Lenzburg. Interregional trains leave Brugg for Basel SBB, Bern, Zürich Hauptbahnhof, and Zürich Airport. Regional trains travel to Aarau (via Wildegg or Lenzburg) and towards Baden and Wettingen. Brugg is also the terminus of the commuter rail (German: &quot;S-Bahn&quot;) line S12, part of Zürich&#x27;s ZVV system.

<text>Pierre-Louis Le Bris (6 February 1929 – 6 June 2015), known as Pierre Brice, was a French actor, best known as portraying fictional Apache-chief Winnetou in German films based on Karl May novels.

==Life and films==
Brice was born in Brest, Brittany, France. When he was 19, Brice enlisted in the French Army and fought in the First Indochina War. While patrolling in Indochina, one of his team triggered a mine and its explosion sent Brice whirling through the air, but left him virtually unhurt. Member of the Commandos Marine, special forces units of the French Navy, he served later as a paratrooper during the Algerian War.

From 1962 to 1968 he acted in a total of eleven West German Western movies adapted from novels by German author Karl May, in which he played the fictional Native American chief Winnetou of the Mescalero Apache tribe, alongside Lex Barker (7 movies), Stewart Granger (3 movies) and Rod Cameron (1 movie) as co-stars. After the films he also played this role at the &quot;Karl May Festspiele&quot; in Elspe from 1977 to 1980 and 1982 to 1986 and at the Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg open-air theatre, Germany, from 1988 to 1991; he also worked there until 1999 as director of several open-air theatre productions. (The open-air theatre in Bad Segeberg is dedicated only to productions of Karl May plays.)

Besides theatre productions, he was mainly seen in TV-series, including &quot;Ein Schloß am Wörthersee&quot; (A Castle by the Wörthersee) and &quot;Die Hütte am See&quot; (Lakeview Cottage). In 1979 Brice again played Winnetou in a 14-part TV series called &quot;Mein Freund Winnetou&quot; (&quot;My friend Winnetou – Winnetou le Mescalero&quot;), which did not originate from Karl May material. In 1997 he appeared in a two-part TV mini series &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Return of Winnetou&quot;), which earned devastating criticism from the fans, since the character had died in the movie &quot;Winnetou III&quot; and now suddenly returned to life. Again, this did not originate from writings by Karl May.

Brice tried to escape the Winnetou character in a 1976 TV series, &quot;Star Maidens&quot;, and in several movies for the big screen, playing &quot;Zorro&quot; in the Italian &quot;Zorro contro Maciste&quot; (1963). He also worked with Terence Hill (still called &quot;Mario Girotti&quot; at the time) in &quot;Shots in Threequarter Time&quot; (1965), with Lex Barker in a non-Karl May film &quot;The Hell of Manitoba&quot; ( &quot;A Place Called Glory&quot;) (1965) and in the anthology &quot;Killer&#x27;s Carnival&quot; (1966).

==Singing career==

Like Lex Barker (who recorded two tracks as a singer), Brice tried to sing with the help of German composer Martin Boettcher, and even managed to issue several singles and CDs. Most of the songs were in German and, as Brice did not understand the language at the time of recording, he had to sing them phonetically.

<doc id="1058208" wikidata="Q1277069" url="?curid=1058208" title="Cult of the Supreme Being">
<text>The Cult of the Supreme Being () was a form of deism established by Maximilien Robespierre during the French Revolution as the intended state religion of France and a replacement for its rival, the Cult of Reason, and of Roman Catholicism. It went unsupported after the fall of Robespierre and, along with the Cult of Reason, was officially banned by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802.

== Origins ==
The French Revolution had occasioned many radical changes in France, but one of the most fundamental for the hitherto Catholic nation was the official rejection of religion. The first new major organized school of thought emerged under the umbrella name of the Cult of Reason. Advocated by radicals like Jacques Hébert and Antoine-François Momoro, the Cult of Reason distilled a mixture of largely atheistic views into an anthropocentric philosophy. No gods at all were worshipped in the Cult of Reason; the guiding principle was devotion to the abstract concept of Reason.
This rejection of all godhead appalled Maximilien Robespierre. Though he was no admirer of Catholicism, he had a special dislike for atheism. He thought that belief in a supreme being was important for social order, and he liked to quote Voltaire: &quot;If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him&quot;. To him, the Cult of Reason&#x27;s philosophical offenses were compounded by the &quot;scandalous scenes&quot; and &quot;wild masquerades&quot; attributed to its practice. In late 1793, Robespierre delivered a fiery denunciation of the Cult of Reason and of its proponents and proceeded to give his own vision of proper Revolutionary religion. Devised almost entirely by Robespierre, the Cult of the Supreme Being was authorized by the National Convention on 7 May 1794 as the civic religion of France.

== Religious tenets ==
Robespierre believed that reason is only a means to an end, and the singular end is virtue. He sought to move beyond simple deism (often described as Voltairean by its adherents) to a new and, in his view, more rational devotion to the godhead. The primary principles of the Cult of the Supreme Being were a belief in the existence of a god and the immortality of the human soul. These beliefs were put to the service of Robespierre&#x27;s fuller meaning, which was of a type of civic-minded, public virtue he attributed to the Greeks and Romans. This type of virtue could only be attained through active fidelity to liberty and democracy. Belief in a living god and a higher moral code, he said, were &quot;constant reminders of justice&quot; and thus essential to a republican society.

On 7 May 1794, the National Convention established the Worship of the Supreme Being; the opening clauses of the &quot;Decree Establishing the Worship of the Supreme Being&quot; of the 18th Floréal of the Year II declared:

*The French People recognize the existence of the Supreme Being and the Immortality of the Soul.
*They declare that the best service of the Supreme Being is the practice of man&#x27;s duties.
*They set among the most important of these duties the detestation of bad faith and tyranny, by punishing tyrants and traitors, by caring for the unfortunate, respecting the weak, defending the oppressed, doing unto others all the good one can, and not being unjust towards anyone.

He dedicated festivals to the Supreme Being, to Truth, Justice, Modesty, Friendship, Frugality, Fidelity, Immortality, Misfortune, etc. The Cult of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of &quot;Emile&quot;.

== Revolutionary impact ==
Robespierre used the religious issue to publicly denounce the motives of many radicals not in his camp, and it led, directly or indirectly, to the executions of Revolutionary de-Christianisers like Hébert, Momoro, and Anacharsis Cloots. The establishment of the Cult of the Supreme Being represented the beginning of the reversal of the wholesale de-Christianization process that had been looked upon previously with official favour. Simultaneously it marked the apogee of Robespierre&#x27;s power. Though in theory he was just an equal member of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre at this point possessed an unrivalled national prominence.

==Festival of the Supreme Being==

To inaugurate the new state religion, Robespierre declared that 20 Prairial Year II (8 June 1794) (also the Christian holiday of Pentecost) would be the first day of national celebration of the Supreme Being, and future republican holidays were to be held every tenth day—the days of rest (&quot;décadi&quot;) in the new French Republican Calendar. Every locality was mandated to hold a commemorative event, but the event in Paris was designed on a massive scale. The festival was organized by the artist Jacques-Louis David and François Joseph Talma and took place around a man-made mountain on the Champ de Mars. Robespierre assumed full leadership of the event, forcefully—and, to many, ostentatiously—declaring the truth and &quot;social utility&quot; of his new religion. While earlier Revolutionary festivals were more spontaneous, the Festival of the Supreme Being was meticulously planned. Historian Mona Ozouf has noted how the &quot;creaking stiffness&quot; of the event has been seen by some to foreshadow &quot;the sclerosis of the Revolution.&quot;

Witnesses state that throughout the &quot;Festival of the Supreme Being&quot;, Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. The procession ended on the Champ de Mars. The Convention climbed to the summit, where a liberty tree had been planted. Dressed in sky-blue coat and nankeen trousers, Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasised his concept of a Supreme Being: there would be no Christ, no Mohammed. 

Someone was heard saying, &quot;Look at the blackguard; it&#x27;s not enough for him to be master, he has to be God&quot;. According to him: &quot;Robespierre proclaimed to believe in the Supreme Being, and who only believed in the power of crime.&quot; Robespierre was also criticized by Vadier, Barère, Courtois and Fouché, members of the Committee of General Security. Joseph Fouché had predicted to him his approaching fall. On 15 June, the president of the Committee of General Security, Vadier, on behalf of the two committees presented a report on a new conspiracy by Catherine Théot, Christophe Antoine Gerle and three others. He insinuated that Robespierre fitted her prophecies. His speech caused much laughter in the convention. Many of her followers were also supporters or friends of Robespierre, which made it seem as if he was attempting to create a new religion, with him as its god. Robespierre felt ridiculed and demanded on the 26th that the investigation of Théot be stopped and Fouquier-Tinville replaced. The deist Cult of the Supreme Being that he had founded and zealously promoted generated suspicion in the eyes of both anticlericals and other political factions, who felt he was developing grandiose delusions about his place in French society.

== Legacy ==
The Cult of the Supreme Being and its festival may have contributed to the Thermidorian Reaction and the downfall of Robespierre. According to Madame de Staël, it was from that time he was lost. With his death at the guillotine on 28 July 1794, the cult lost all official sanction and disappeared from public view. It was officially banned by Napoleon on 8 April 1802 with his &quot;Law on Cults of 18 Germinal, Year X&quot;.

<doc id="1058210" wikidata="Q106916848" url="?curid=1058210" title="Missionary Training Center">
<text>Missionary Training Centers (MTC) are centers devoted to training missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The flagship MTC is located in Provo, Utah, adjacent to the campus of Brigham Young University (BYU), a private university owned and operated by the church.

At the beginning of their service, missionaries usually spend 3 to 9 weeks at an MTC where they receive training in doctrine, conduct, proselyting methods, and, when required, a new language. As of July 2023, in addition to Provo, there are 9 MTCs throughout the world, in Brazil, England, Ghana, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, and South Africa. Missionaries serve in 150 countries teaching in 60 different languages around the world.

New missionaries assigned to the Provo MTC arrive Monday–Wednesday (couple missionaries on Monday, international arrivals on Tuesday, U.S. and Canada on Wednesday), at which point they begin using their titles of &quot;Elder&quot; (boys) and &quot;Sister&quot; (girls). They are assigned companions and organized into districts and branches. During their training, the elders and sisters will spend the majority of their time in class, with breaks for meals, church services, temple attendance, fitness activities, service projects, and personal preparation time (for laundry, letter writing, etc.).

Missionaries have historically been given at least three weeks of training in proselyting methods. This includes lessons on church doctrine and teaching, mission rules, and proper interactions with the people they will serve, teach, and work with in their assigned missions. Missionaries are also encouraged to use their time outside class to actively study church scriptures and doctrine, and a language if necessary. Missionaries study and learn from a manual called “Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ&quot; which is a 2023 second edition to the original “Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Work” originally published in 2004. The new edition includes information about using technology, social media, and teaching online. It also emphasizes Jesus Christ more and provides more clarity about covenants and his doctrine.

In many cases, missionaries who already speak the language of their assigned area are sent to their mission after four weeks. Other missionaries may spend as many as nine additional weeks in language training. The MTC language programs encourage a full immersion experience with the motto &quot;SYL,&quot; for &quot;Speak Your Language.&quot; In some cases, missionaries learning foreign languages go directly to the MTC in the country where they are called to serve. This depends on the capacity of the MTC in the area.

Each MTC is directed by a mission president, just like each of the 400+ missions worldwide. Classes in the MTC are typically taught by returned (former) missionaries. The missionaries are also assigned to small congregations called branches, which are led by local church members called to serve in the MTC.

==History of the MTC==
The MTC was originally started by LDS Church after some of its missionaries were stranded in the United States due to difficulties in obtaining passport visas to other countries. Diplomatic relations between the United States and other countries where missionaries served became strained, limiting the number of missionaries serving in those areas. Often these missionaries would simply be reassigned to another area, but as the number of missionaries grew this became more of a problem.

===Salt Lake Mission Home===
The missionary experience prior to the opening of the MTC was quite different from that established later. In 1925, a small building adjacent to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City had a dormitory for brand new missionaries. Missionaries arriving here would then be set apart to their missionary service by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Often, they would even be interviewed by these apostles during this time and attend a service in the Salt Lake Temple, staying just a day or two before leaving to their assigned areas. Missionaries who had difficulty trying to get to their assigned areas would then either serve as tour guides on Temple Square or do clerical tasks at church headquarters.

In 1971, the old Lafayette School at 75 East North Temple Street was converted into the new Salt Lake Mission Home, and English-speaking missionaries would arrive on a Saturday and leave the following Wednesday or Thursday. The MTC in Provo replaced this in the fall of 1978 for English-speaking missionaries.

===BYU===
In part to keep the missionaries occupied while they were waiting for their visas, many of these missionaries were enrolled in courses at BYU. As language instruction was considered essential, most of these missionaries were enrolled in courses to learn the languages of the areas where they would be serving.

This proved to be problematic, however, as missionaries would arrive and depart at random intervals throughout the year as they accepted missionary assignments or as the visa paperwork was completed and approved by the country they were trying to get into. This did not fit well within the semester system for the rest of the BYU students, and eventually required professors that were dedicated strictly to teaching missionaries instead of the traditional university students.

A permanent organization was needed to cope with the needs of these missionaries.

===Language Training Mission===

By November 1961, missionaries gathered at the Hotel Roberts in downtown Provo under the direction of Ernest J. Wilkins, a professor of Spanish in the BYU Languages Department. Around 1964, the activities were moved to Amanda Knight Hall and Knight-Mangum Hall, buildings on the lower campus of BYU, which were reserved exclusively for the training of missionaries. A new church mission, the Language Training Mission (LTM), was created with its own mission presidency and organization, with the geographic extent of the mission to be the perimeter of the building. This building included dormitories as well as classrooms for the missionaries. Eventually, other buildings on the campus of BYU were also used for missionary training activities.

The church constructed and operated a large LTM in Laie, Hawaii. Through the 1970s, the Hawaiian LTM received missionaries from around the world who were preparing to serve as missionaries in the Asia Pacific regions, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Polynesia.

Instructors for the LTM were employed by BYU. Sometimes these were full-time professors from the university, but more often they were teaching assistants or university students who had skills in the languages being taught. In many cases, instructors were former missionaries who had just returned from the areas where the missionaries in the LTM were to be sent. Curriculum was still planned directly by the foreign language departments at BYU, in coordination with the LTM mission presidency.

In the beginning, the LTM was intended to be a temporary place for those missionaries who were having visa difficulties. However, mission presidents who received visa-delayed missionaries started to notice a significant improvement in their proselytizing skills over similar missionaries who were able to get their visas almost immediately. It was estimated that even a few weeks of intensive language training at the beginning could save almost a full year&#x27;s worth of effort trying to learn the language &quot;on the streets.&quot; Mission presidents soon asked church headquarters to have all the missionaries, regardless of their visa status, attend language training before their departure.

During this expansion of the LTM&#x27;s role, additional types of instruction were added to the curriculum, including leadership training and basic instructor training. After several years of language and general missionary skills training, the mission presidents serving in English-speaking areas were requesting their missionaries also have the opportunity to take additional classes taught at the LTM. With an overall increase in missionaries serving, as well as a large number of missionaries who would be attending the LTM due to program changes, plans were made to move the whole mission to another location.

===Provo MTC===
At about the same time the Provo Temple was built, the church acquired some nearby land which was originally slated for expansion of the BYU campus. This land was used to build four dormitories, a gymnasium, and a language training building. The name of the LTM was changed to the MTC in 1978, to note that it was for more than just language training, although it would continue to be a significant feature of the facility. The Salt Lake Mission Home was closed, and all remaining functions of that facility were merged into the MTC, including administrative functions that were not otherwise handled directly by church headquarters.

Due to the growth of the church, the number of buildings and the size of the main administrative building were expanded to cope with the increased activity at the Provo MTC campus. Ultimately, even this growth could no longer be accommodated and it became apparent the church would need to build training centers in places other than Provo.

===MTCs around the world===

With the growth of the LDS Church outside the United States, it soon became almost impossible for missionaries living outside the United States to be able to come to Provo and attend the MTC, both for financial reasons as well as for visa difficulties. Just as it had been a problem for American missionaries to obtain visas to go abroad, it became difficult for church members without American citizenship to come to Utah, often for the same reasons.

After the development of the ecclesiastical areas as a level of administration in the church&#x27;s hierarchy, area presidents outside North America were authorized to establish independent MTCs for members living within the area. This removed most international travel requirements for many missionaries, especially for missionaries who spoke the language of their own country and were able to serve locally.

One of the first of these missionary training centers was established in 1977 in São Paulo, Brazil, adjacent to the newly dedicated São Paulo Brazil Temple. The church constructed a new building in the Casa Verde neighborhood of São Paulo. The Brazil MTC building has a maximum capacity of 646.

As the number of missionaries coming from North America grew, it was decided to send many of the missionaries directly to areas where they would soon be serving, if there was a local MTC capable of servicing them. This has allowed the growth of MTCs outside the U.S. instead of building another MTC campus in North America. Missionaries from North America who have visa difficulties still attend the Provo MTC first, and often serve temporarily in areas of the United States while awaiting visas. Missionaries from countries outside the U.S. where there is not an MTC in their own country attend in a country closest to them.

The England MTC was transferred from London to Preston after the completion of the temple site in 1998. The former London MTC buildings are now used for other church purposes.

Africa has MTCs in Ghana and South Africa. The Ghana MTC was built first because of the rapid growth of the church in West Africa and the need for more missionaries there. The Ghana MTC in Tema was dedicated on May 17, 2002. Although it was only able to support 90 missionaries, it was the bigger than the South Africa MTC. Because of the rapid growth of the church in Africa, in August 2017, a bigger capacity MTC was built to accommodate up to 500 missionaries next to the Accra Ghana Temple to serve most of Africa. The South Africa MTC was opened on July 24, 2003, with only 14 missionaries. It is the smallest MTC in the world with a capacity of 38 missionaries. The MTC shares a building with the South Africa Johannesburg Mission. The MTC reached a milestone of 1,000 total intakes in 2009.

A private high school operated by the church in Mexico City, known as Benemerito De Las Americas, was permanently closed at the end of the 2012–13 term, and the Mexico City MTC was relocated there, opening June 26, 2013. This greatly expanded the capacity of the Mexico City MTC, such that it is second in size only to the Provo MTC: the old building near the México City México Temple could accommodate 125 missionaries at a time, while the new 90-acre campus can handle over 1,000.

Following a church announcement on March 29, 2018, the MTCs in Santiago, Chile and Madrid, Spain closed in January 2019. The announcement stated that &quot;this decision comes as Church leaders continue to seek the best use of resources worldwide according to the needs and demands of each area.&quot; Citing the same reasons, the church announced on December 12, 2018, that the MTC in the Dominican Republic would also close in January 2019. As of February 2019, with these closures, there were 12 MTCs around the world. On February 8, 2019, the church announced that the MTC in Buenos Aires, Argentina would close in July 2019. The announcement noted part of the reason would be to more effectively use the MTCs in Mexico and Brazil. A similar announcement that the Guatemala MTC would close in January 2020 was made on September 19, 2019.

==Provo MTC==
The MTC in Provo, Utah, is still the largest and can accommodate up to 3,700 missionaries. The facility includes a large gymnasium, cafeterias, a medical clinic, a bookstore, a mail center, a call center, laundry facilities, classrooms, meetinghouses, and residence halls. Approximately 55 languages are taught at the Provo MTC.

=== Training services ===

Previously called TRC (Teaching Resource Center), the Helping Others department gives missionaries experience teaching in their mission language, even if it is their native tongue. All missionaries visit the training services each week. Helping Others Actors who speak the language portray &quot;people being taught&quot; (people who are interested in the church) in these teaching situations.

Actors are usually returned missionaries and/or BYU students with language abilities. Members of other faiths are able to work as actors as well.

==List of MTCs==
As of August 2024, there are 11 MTCs throughout the world.

In addition, the Church operates the India Service Support Center in Hyderabad, India. The Church has not published details about this center, but in 2023, its new president and his wife attended the Seminar for New MTC Leaders, so it appears that it is considered an MTC of sorts.

=== List of closed MTCs ===
In 2010, the New Zealand MTC moved from Hamilton to Auckland. The previously open MTCs in Tokyo and Seoul have closed. Following a church announcement on March 29, 2018, the MTCs in Santiago, Chile and Madrid, Spain closed in January 2019. On December 12, 2018, the church announced the MTC in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic would also close in January 2019. Following an initial announcement on February 8, 2019, the MTC in Buenos Aires, Argentina closed in July 2019. On September 19, 2019, the church announced it will close the MTC in Guatemala in January 2020.

<doc id="1058211" wikidata="Q260386" url="?curid=1058211" title="Valley of the Queens">
<text>The Valley of the Queens is a site in Egypt, in which queens, princes, princesses, and other high-ranking officials were buried from roughly 1560 BC to 1130 BC. Pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. The Valley of the Queens was known anciently as &quot;Ta-Set-Neferu&quot;, which has a double meaning of &quot;The Place of Beauty&quot; and/or &quot;the Place of the Royal Children&quot;. Excavation of the tombs at the Valley of the Queens was pioneered by Ernesto Schiaparelli and Francesco Ballerini in the early 1900s.

The Valley of the Queens consists of the main wadi, which contains most of the tombs, along with the Valley of Prince Ahmose, the Valley of the Rope, the Valley of the Three Pits, and the Valley of the Dolmen. The main wadi contains 91 tombs and the subsidiary valleys add another 19 tombs. The burials in the subsidiary valleys all date to the 18th Dynasty.

The reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The close proximity to the workers&#x27; village of Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings may have been a factor. Another consideration could have been the existence of a sacred grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may have been associated with rejuvenation of the dead.

Along with the Valley of the Kings and nearby Thebes, the Valley of the Queens was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.

== Geology ==
The Valley of the Queens is on a geological array of limestones, marls, clays, chalks, and shale. The clays in the valley have undergone expansion and shrinkage due to recurrent flash-flooding throughout the valley. This shrinkage has been one cause of unstable tomb construction and later tomb damage in the valley. Rockslides resulting from shrunk clay deposits and tectonic events have damaged not only the tombs of the valley but also the wall paintings within them.

The current landscape of the Valley of the Queens was built through faulting and subsequent slumping during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. Thus, the original horizontal stratigraphy of the area has been subject to tilting. This tilting has revealed deposits of minerals like anhydrite, gypsum, and halite. Salt from halite in the ground is also damaging to the paintings within tombs. Seeping groundwater has permeated the tombs and is the cause of the dissolved and recrystallized salt.

Gypsum, along with clay, is most often believed to be the plasters used in ancient Egypt. Due to the lack of data, however, it is hard to determine what exactly composes the ancient plasters. Such beliefs are contested because of variations of plaster color, hardness, and amount used in a particular tomb.

==Eighteenth Dynasty==
One of the first tombs constructed in the Valley of the Queens is the tomb of Princess Ahmose, a daughter of Seqenenre Tao and Queen Sitdjehuti. This tomb likely dates to the reign of Thutmose I. The tombs from this period also include several members of the nobility, including a head of the stables and a vizier.

The tombs from the Valley of the Three Pits mostly date to the Thutmosid period. The tombs are labeled with letters A - L. This valley also contains three shaft tombs, which are the origin of the valley&#x27;s name. The modern labels for these three tombs are QV 89, QV 90, and QV 91.

The Valley of the Dolmen contains an old trail used by the workmen traveling from Deir el-Medina to the Valley of the Queens. Along this path is a small rock-cut temple dedicated to Ptah and Meretseger.

The tombs from this time period are generally simple in form and consist of a chamber and a shaft for burial. Some of the tombs were extended in size to accommodate more than one burial. The tombs include those of several royal princes and princesses, as well as some nobles.

It has long been thought that that finds located in museums which include fragments of burial equipment for several members of the royal family were from the Valley of the Queens. However, these items which include a canopic jar fragment of the King&#x27;s Wife Henut, canopic jar fragments mentioning a King&#x27;s Son, Menkheperre, a King&#x27;s Great Wife, Nebetnehat, canopic jar fragments with the name of the King&#x27;s Daughter Ti, all come from the Shaft Tombs of Wadi Bairiya 4.5 kilometres north-west of the Valley of the Queens. 

==Nineteenth Dynasty==

During the 19th Dynasty the use of the Valley became more selective. The tombs from this period belong exclusively to royal women. Many of the high-ranking wives of Ramesses I, Seti I and Ramesses II were buried in the Valley. One of the most well-known examples is the resting place carved out of the rock for Queen Nefertari (1290–1224 BCE). The polychrome reliefs in her tomb are still intact. Other members of the royal family continued to be buried in the Valley of the Kings. Tomb KV5, the tomb of the sons of Ramesses II, is an example of this practice.

The tomb of Queen Satre (QV 38) was likely the first tomb prepared during this dynasty. It was probably started during the reign of Ramesses I and finished during the reign of Seti I. Several tombs were prepared without an owner in mind, and the names were included upon the death of the royal female.

==Twentieth Dynasty==
During the beginning of the 20th Dynasty the Valley was still used extensively. Tombs for the wives of Ramesses III were prepared, and in a departure from the conventions of the previous dynasty, several tombs were prepared for royal sons as well. The construction of tombs continued at least until the reign of Ramesses VI. The Turin Papyrus mentions the creation of six tombs during the reign of Ramesses VI. It is not known which tombs are referred to in that papyrus.

There is evidence of economic turmoil during the 20th Dynasty. Records show that the workers went on strike during the reign of Ramesses III, and towards the end of the dynasty there are reports of tomb robberies.

==Third Intermediate Period and later==

The Valley was no longer a royal burial site after the close of the 20th Dynasty. Many of the tombs were extensively reused. Several tombs were modified so that they could hold multiple burials. In some cases this involved digging burial pits in the existing tombs. Not much is known about the use of the Valley of the Queens during the Ptolemaic Period but during the Roman Period there was a renewed, extensive use of the Valley as a burial site. During the Coptic Period some Hermit shelters were erected. Tombs QV60 (Nebettawy) and QV73 (Henuttawy) show signs of Coptic occupation. Wall scenes were covered with plaster and decorated with Christian symbols. The Christian presence lasted until the 7th century CE.

== Threats to conservation ==
Conservation efforts in the Valley of the Queens happen in multiple ways. Some large concerns for the site include protection against mass tourism and a concoction of other natural risks.

=== Mass tourism ===
With the rise of the tourism industry, effects humans have on archaeological sites is becoming a topic of interest for preservation teams. Due to their relatively small size and delicate ecosystem, many of the Valley of the Queens tombs are threatened by human interaction. An off balance of humidity and CO2 from humans contributes to the continued degradation of tombs and the art within them. Other factors that lead to tomb deterioration are graffiti, touching, and head bumping due to small spaces.

Light fixtures installed in some of the tombs for better viewing are also a threat to conservation efforts in the area. Large amounts of lint from visitors&#x27; clothes stays in the air and settles on tomb floors and other fixtures, creating an increased fire hazard. As lint settles on the modern light fixtures, the likeliness of combustion increases.

Steps taken to combat and limit effects on Valley of the Queens tombs from tourism consist of building walled paths that control tourist traffic, constructing shelters at some of the more popular tombs such as QV 66 - Nefertari&#x27;s tomb. Other methods used to preserve Nefertari&#x27;s tomb are a viewing time limited to 15 minutes, separate ticket purchase, and the addition of an air-circulation system to the tomb. As for other tombs, plexiglass shields and wooden floors have been installed to protect the entombed and their resting places.

=== Animal populations ===
Commonly located in open tombs in the Valley of the Queens are small to large bat colonies. Although beneficial for the natural ecosystem, bats are detrimental to the tombs, the wall paintings, and the health of tourists in the valley. Urine and feces from bats damages the rocks, plasters, and paints used for tomb construction and decoration. Also stemming from bat excrement is the increased possibility of visitors getting histoplasmosis. Contact with bat populations also increases the possibility of bat bites and rabies transmission.

In an attempt to limit bat occupation of certain tombs, installation of doors and has been proposed. Bat populations must be removed from the tombs before any preventative measures can be taken. Due to ecological importance, some tombs have been selected to remain open to bat colonies. Tombs selected are as follows: QV 15, QV 48, and QV 78.

<doc id="1058218" wikidata="Q7449424" url="?curid=1058218" title="Semigroup action">
<text>In algebra and theoretical computer science, an action or act of a [[semigroup]] on a set is a rule which associates to each element of the semigroup a transformation of the set in such a way that the product of two elements of the semigroup (using the semigroup operation) is associated with the composite of the two corresponding transformations. The terminology conveys the idea that the elements of the semigroup are &quot;acting&quot; as transformations of the set. From an algebraic perspective, a semigroup action is a generalization of the notion of a group action in group theory. From the computer science point of view, semigroup actions are closely related to automata: the set models the state of the automaton and the action models transformations of that state in response to inputs.

An important special case is a monoid action or act, in which the semigroup is a monoid and the identity element of the monoid acts as the identity transformation of a set. From a category theoretic point of view, a monoid is a category with one object, and an act is a functor from that category to the category of sets. This immediately provides a generalization to monoid acts on objects in categories other than the category of sets.

Another important special case is a [[transformation semigroup]]. This is a semigroup of transformations of a set, and hence it has a tautological action on that set. This concept is linked to the more general notion of a semigroup by an analogue of Cayley&#x27;s theorem.

&quot;(A note on terminology: the terminology used in this area varies, sometimes significantly, from one author to another. See the article for details.)&quot;

==Formal definitions==

Let &quot;S&quot; be a semigroup. Then a (left) semigroup action (or act) of &quot;S&quot; is a set &quot;X&quot; together with an operation which is compatible with the semigroup operation ∗ as follows:
* for all &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, .
This is the analogue in semigroup theory of a (left) group action, and is equivalent to a semigroup homomorphism into the set of functions on &quot;X&quot;. Right semigroup actions are defined in a similar way using an operation satisfying .

If &quot;M&quot; is a monoid, then a (left) monoid action (or act) of &quot;M&quot; is a (left) semigroup action of &quot;M&quot; with the additional property that
* for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;: &quot;e&quot; • &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;
where &quot;e&quot; is the identity element of &quot;M&quot;. This correspondingly gives a monoid homomorphism. Right monoid actions are defined in a similar way. A monoid &quot;M&quot; with an action on a set is also called an operator monoid.

A semigroup action of &quot;S&quot; on &quot;X&quot; can be made into monoid act by adjoining an identity to the semigroup and requiring that it acts as the identity transformation on &quot;X&quot;.

===Terminology and notation===

If &quot;S&quot; is a semigroup or monoid, then a set &quot;X&quot; on which &quot;S&quot; acts as above (on the left, say) is also known as a (left) S&quot;-act, S&quot;-set, S&quot;-action, S&quot;-operand, or left act over &quot;S&quot;. Some authors do not distinguish between semigroup and monoid actions, by regarding the identity axiom () as empty when there is no identity element, or by using the term unitary &quot;S&quot;-act for an &quot;S&quot;-act with an identity.

The defining property of an act is analogous to the associativity of the semigroup operation, and means that all parentheses can be omitted. It is common practice, especially in computer science, to omit the operations as well so that both the semigroup operation and the action are indicated by juxtaposition. In this way strings of letters from &quot;S&quot; act on &quot;X&quot;, as in the expression &quot;stx&quot; for &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.

It is also quite common to work with right acts rather than left acts. However, every right S-act can be interpreted as a left act over the opposite semigroup, which has the same elements as S, but where multiplication is defined by reversing the factors, , so the two notions are essentially equivalent. Here we primarily adopt the point of view of left acts.

===Acts and transformations===

It is often convenient (for instance if there is more than one act under consideration) to use a letter, such as formula_1, to denote the function
:formula_2
defining the formula_3-action and hence write formula_4 in place of formula_5. Then for any formula_6 in formula_3, we denote by
:formula_8
the transformation of formula_9 defined by
:formula_10
By the defining property of an formula_3-act, formula_1 satisfies
:formula_13
Further, consider a function formula_14. It is the same as formula_15 (see &quot;Currying&quot;). Because formula_16 is a bijection, semigroup actions can be defined as functions formula_17 which satisfy
:formula_18
That is, formula_1 is a semigroup action of formula_3 on formula_9 if and only if formula_22 is a semigroup homomorphism from formula_3 to the full transformation monoid of formula_9.

===&quot;S&quot;-homomorphisms===

Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X&quot;′ be &quot;S&quot;-acts. Then an &quot;S&quot;-homomorphism from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot;′ is a map
:formula_25
such that 
:formula_26 for all formula_27 and formula_28.
The set of all such &quot;S&quot;-homomorphisms is commonly written as formula_29.

&quot;M&quot;-homomorphisms of &quot;M&quot;-acts, for &quot;M&quot; a monoid, are defined in exactly the same way.

===&quot;S&quot;-Act and &quot;M&quot;-Act===

For a fixed semigroup &quot;S&quot;, the left &quot;S&quot;-acts are the objects of a category, denoted &quot;S&quot;-Act, whose morphisms are the &quot;S&quot;-homomorphisms. The corresponding category of right &quot;S&quot;-acts is sometimes denoted by Act-&quot;S&quot;. (This is analogous to the categories &quot;R&quot;-Mod and Mod-&quot;R&quot; of left and right modules over a ring.)

For a monoid &quot;M&quot;, the categories &quot;M&quot;-Act and Act-&quot;M&quot; are defined in the same way.

==Examples==
* Any semigroup formula_30 has an action on formula_3, where formula_32. The action property holds due to the associativity of formula_33.
* More generally, for any semigroup homomorphism formula_34, the semigroup formula_30 has an action on formula_1 given by formula_37.
* For any set formula_9, let formula_39 be the set of sequences of elements of formula_9. The semigroup formula_41 has an action on formula_39 given by formula_43 (where formula_44 denotes formula_6 repeated formula_46 times).
* The semigroup formula_41 has a right action formula_48, given by formula_49.

==Transformation semigroups==

A correspondence between transformation semigroups and semigroup actions is described below. If we restrict it to faithful semigroup actions, it has nice properties.

Any transformation semigroup can be turned into a semigroup action by the following construction. For any transformation semigroup formula_3 of formula_9, define a semigroup action formula_1 of formula_3 on formula_9 as formula_55 for formula_56. This action is faithful, which is equivalent to formula_57 being injective.

Conversely, for any semigroup action formula_1 of formula_3 on formula_9, define a transformation semigroup formula_61. In this construction we &quot;forget&quot; the set formula_3. formula_63 is equal to the image of formula_57. Let us denote formula_57 as formula_66 for brevity. If formula_66 is injective, then it is a semigroup isomorphism from formula_3 to formula_63. In other words, if formula_1 is faithful, then we forget nothing important. This claim is made precise by the following observation: if we turn formula_63 back into a semigroup action formula_72 of formula_63 on formula_9, then formula_75 for all formula_76. formula_1 and formula_72 are &quot;isomorphic&quot; via formula_66, i.e., we essentially recovered formula_1. Thus, some authors see no distinction between faithful semigroup actions and transformation semigroups.

==Applications to computer science==
===Semiautomata===

Transformation semigroups are of essential importance for the structure theory of finite-state machines in automata theory. In particular, a &quot;semiautomaton&quot; is a triple (Σ,&quot;X&quot;,&quot;T&quot;), where Σ is a non-empty set called the &quot;input alphabet&quot;, &quot;X&quot; is a non-empty set called the &quot;set of states&quot; and &quot;T&quot; is a function
:formula_81
called the &quot;transition function&quot;. Semiautomata arise from deterministic automata by ignoring the initial state and the set of accept states.

Given a semiautomaton, let &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot;, for &quot;a&quot; ∈ Σ, denote the transformation of &quot;X&quot; defined by &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;T&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;x&quot;). Then the semigroup of transformations of &quot;X&quot; generated by {&quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot; : &quot;a&quot; ∈ Σ} is called the &quot;characteristic semigroup&quot; or &quot;transition system&quot; of (Σ,&quot;X&quot;,&quot;T&quot;). This semigroup is a monoid, so this monoid is called the &quot;characteristic&quot; or &quot;transition monoid&quot;. It is also sometimes viewed as a Σ∗-act on &quot;X&quot;, where Σ∗ is the free monoid of strings generated by the alphabet Σ, and the action of strings extends the action of Σ via the property
:formula_82

===Krohn–Rhodes theory===

Krohn–Rhodes theory, sometimes also called &quot;algebraic automata theory&quot;, gives powerful decomposition results for finite transformation semigroups by cascading simpler components.

<text>Venceremos (Spanish for &quot;We will be victorious&quot;) was an American far-left and primarily Chicano political group active in the Palo Alto, California area from 1969 to 1973.

== History ==
The organization was founded in 1966 by Aaron Manganiello (a former Brown Beret) as a largely Latino left-wing group; it evolved to an increasingly Maoist/Communist brigade. Katerina Del Valle was its chairperson. In 1971 they were joined by a faction of the Maoist organization Revolutionary Union (RU), led by H. Bruce Franklin, a Stanford University English professor. More whites joined the organization through this period. Franklin was fired in 1972 on charges of violating his commitment to the university by &quot;inciting to riot&quot; in 1971. 

Venceremos and Franklin favored a militant strategy based on protracted urban guerrilla warfare. According to Franklin, &quot;... these collectives had been heavily involved in youth organizing within white proletarian communities, in factory organizing and in anti-imperialist struggles on the campuses. [...] The new combined organization was multi-national, extremely diversified in its activities and base, and quite militant.&quot;

Venceremos publicly advocated armed self-defense by the citizenry, community control of the police, and reform of the prison system. To these ends, the group&#x27;s members engaged in a number of legal activities, such as working to educate prisoners and defend Vietnam War protesters. The organization&#x27;s ultimate stated goal was the overthrow of the government. In 1970, Venceremos opened its own community college in a Redwood City storefront; it operated for two years until running out of money. The House Committee on Internal Security considered Venceremos a serious political threat, as described in its 202-page report &quot;America&#x27;s Maoists: the Revolutionary Union, the Venceremos Organization&quot; (1972).

Venceremos members often participated in City Council and School Board meetings in Palo Alto with a verbal aggressiveness rarely seen before in the city&#x27;s politics. Member Jeffrey Youdelman was known for offensive shouting down of council members and presenting petitions for radical left causes. Venceremos members ran for local office in Palo Alto, including Jean Hobson and Youdelman who unsuccessfully ran for City Council in 1971 and 1973, respectively. Doug Garrett ran for the School Board. 

During this period, Venceremos held weekly rallies at Lytton Plaza in Palo Alto, which they dubbed &quot;The People&#x27;s Plaza.&quot; In May 1971, Venceremos&#x27;s Easter Division drifted away from the center and began organizing through the United Farm Workers union.

A small group of Venceremos members attempted to free a federal prisoner on October 6, 1972; several members were involved in the murder, which hit the headlines. Member Jean Hobson had been romantically linked to federal prison inmate Ronald Beaty, who was incarcerated at Chino Prison. She and other Venceremos members made a plan to gain Beaty&#x27;s escape. According to police and Beaty, who became the prosecution&#x27;s star witness, two unarmed prison guards were taking Beaty to a court appearance in San Bernardino when their vehicle was ambushed near Chino. Beaty was freed when Venceremos member, 23-year-old Robert Seabok, shot both guards at point blank range, killing Jesus Sanchez and wounding his partner George Fitzgerald.

After the police captured Beaty and Hobson nearly a month later, Beaty named Venceremos members Hobson, Seabok, Andrea Holman Burt, and Benton Burt as the perpetrators of the fatal assault on the prison guards. Former professor H. Bruce Franklin, four Venceremos members, and three Arizona residents were arrested in this case in late December 1972. A total of fourteen people were arrested; twelve were charged either with murder or, as was Franklin, with harboring Beaty, classified as a federal fugitive. 

While charges were dropped against some, the chief perpetrators were tried. Jean Hobson, 19 year-old Andrea Holman Burt, and her husband 31-year-old Douglas Burt were all convicted of second-degree murder in 1973 and 1974. Seabok was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Beaty had become a prosecution witness; he pleaded guilty for being part of Sanchez&#x27;s death and was sentenced to life as well. By September 1973 Venceremos had officially disbanded. Some members went on to other leftist groups, such as Joe Remiro, who joined the small Symbionese Liberation Army in its early days.

== Aftermath ==
Venceremos disintegrated under the duress of legal troubles, recriminations over the Beaty incident, and general . By September 1973 it had ceased to function as an organization. Robert Seabok was convicted of first degree murder; while Jean Hobson, Andrea Holman Burt, and Benton Burt were convicted of second degree murder. 

In March 1973, Donald DeFreeze, a prison inmate who was on somewhat familiar terms with Bay Area radicals through visits from the UC Berkeley Prison Outreach Project, escaped from Soledad Prison and made his way to Oakland. He found shelter with members or associates of Venceremos at the Peking House commune, but commune members were concerned about police surveillance. They moved DeFreeze to a lower-profile location east of the hills in Concord. Calling himself General Field Marshal Cinque, he co-founded the Symbionese Liberation Army with Patricia Soltysik, a white woman, and a few mostly white associates he met as a prisoner and member of the Black Cultural Association at Vacaville Prison, including former Venceremos members Joe Remiro and Willie Wolfe.

The Communist Party USA (Provisional) also traces its origins to the 1973 split within Venceremos.

<doc id="1058222" wikidata="Q778539" url="?curid=1058222" title="Cornelius (musician)">
<text>, also known by his moniker , is a Japanese musician and producer who co-founded Flipper&#x27;s Guitar, an influential Shibuya-kei band, and subsequently embarked on a solo career. In 1997, he released the album &quot;Fantasma&quot;, which landed him praise from American music critics, who called him a &quot;modern-day Brian Wilson&quot; or the &quot;Japanese Beck&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; named two of Oyamada&#x27;s albums amongst the &quot;100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time&quot;, with &quot;Fantasma&quot; ranking in 10th place and &quot;Camera Talk&quot; by Flipper&#x27;s Guitar ranking in 35th place.

==Life and career==

Oyamada was born in Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan. His first claim to fame was as a member of the pop duo Flipper&#x27;s Guitar, one of the key groups of the Tokyo Shibuya-kei scene. Following the disbandment of Flipper&#x27;s Guitar in 1991, Oyamada donned the &quot;Cornelius&quot; moniker and embarked on a successful solo career. He chose his pseudonym in tribute to the character of the same name from the film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. He commissioned a song, about himself, on Momus&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Stars Forever&quot;.

In 2005, the Spinto Band referenced him in their song &quot;Japan Is an Island&quot; on their album &quot;Nice and Nicely Done&quot;.

As of September 2006, he was no longer signed to Matador Records.

In 2006 and 2007 respectively, the song &quot;The Micro Disneycal World Tour&quot; from the &quot;Fantasma&quot; album, was used for Nick Park&#x27;s &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; and Sky television&#x27;s &quot;Surf, Speak, See&quot; advertisements in the UK. It had also been used several years earlier in an ironic NFL television commercial in the US, which juxtaposed the song&#x27;s relaxing qualities with video clips showing rapid, aggressive football playmaking.

In 2010, he contributed the song &quot;Katayanagi Twins vs. Sex Bob-Omb&quot; to the film soundtrack of &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;.

In 2013, he participated with Taku Satoh and Yugo Nakamura directing the music for the exhibition Design Ah! at 21_21 Design Sight in Tokyo.

==Musical style==
Cornelius was a pioneer of the Shibuya-kei style of music in Japan. The music of Cornelius could be described as experimental and exploratory, and often incorporates dissonant elements alongside more familiar harmonically &quot;pleasing&quot; sounds. This tension, plus his practice of bringing in sounds and samples from mass culture, pure electronic tones, and sounds from nature (such as on his &quot;Point&quot; album), lead him to being sometimes characterized as an &quot;acquired taste&quot;. American music journalists often describe Cornelius&#x27; musical style as being similar to Beck&#x27;s, whom he acknowledges as an influence along with the Beach Boys, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream and the Brazilian band Kassin + 2, among others.

==Personal life==
Oyamada married musician and collaborator Takako Minekawa in 2000 and they have one child, Milo, named after the son of Cornelius in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. They divorced in 2012. Since 2020, he has been in a long term relationship with Minami Yamaguchi, the owner of a fashion shop in Setagaya, Tokyo.
He is a second cousin of Joi Ito and Miki Berenyi, the latter who appears on the song &quot;The Spell of a Vanishing Loveliness&quot; from &quot;Mellow Waves&quot;.

===Bullying controversy===
In interviews in 1994 and 1995, Oyamada said that he had bullied and assaulted several students with disabilities in school. In one interview, Oyamada dismissed the incidents with a laugh. In a 1995 interview for &quot;&quot;, Oyamada said he was involved with a group of bullies who had locked a disabled student in a vaulting box, wrapped another student in gymnastics mattresses and kicked them, forced a student to eat their excrement, taped a cardboard box around a student&#x27;s head and poured chalk inside, made fun of a disabled student running a long-distance race, and forced a student to masturbate in front of other students. A dialogue between Oyamada and the victims was planned by the magazine &quot;Rockin&#x27;On Japan&quot;, but all of the victims refused to meet him. One of the victims&#x27; mothers picked up the phone and told the interviewer that her son had considered suicide.

On July 14, 2021, the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) announced that Oyamada would be a composer of the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, with the concept being &quot;the ability to celebrate differences, to empathise, and to live side by side with compassion for one another&quot;. The announcement caused a social media backlash due to Oyamada&#x27;s personal history. Two days later, Oyamada tweeted an apology, but also said articles had contained exaggerations or mistakes that he had not corrected. On the same day, the TOCOG issued a statement stating they were unaware of the interviews and that while Oyamada&#x27;s actions were &quot;very inappropriate&quot;, they had not dismissed him from the ceremony. Toshirō Mutō, the chief executive of the Organising Committee and ex-chairman of Kaisei Academy, said he wanted Oyamada to remain. On July 19, four days before the ceremony, Oyamada decided to leave the creative team for the Tokyo Olympics on his own terms.

In September 2021, Oyamada appeared in a two-hour interview with &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; addressing why he took so many years to address his past actions. He made an additional statement which stated how a blog post that circulated online edited information from past interviews to describe Oyamada as the perpetrator, even though the original &quot;Quick Japan&quot; interview stated that he did not commit the acts in question. There is a statement on Oyamada&#x27;s official Cornelius website, from the artist himself, that addresses these matters in depth.

<text>&quot;Namibia, Land of the Brave&quot; is the national anthem of Namibia, adopted in December 1991. It was composed by Axali Doëseb, who was the director of a traditional music group from the Kalahari Desert. Doëseb was chosen to compose it after winning a contest held after Namibia became independent in 1990.

== History ==
Namibia&#x27;s first national anthem, albeit unofficial, was &quot;&quot; while under German colonization as German South-West Africa. After it became South-West Africa as a League of Nations mandate under the Union of South Africa, the national anthem was changed to &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; to match South Africa&#x27;s. Following independence, &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; was provisionally adopted as a temporary national anthem pending the formal adoption of an official national anthem. It was later decided that Namibia needed a unique anthem, and a national competition was held to compose a new national anthem. The competition was won by Axali Doeseb with &quot;Namibia, Land of the Brave&quot;. The anthem was first played in public in a ceremony on the first anniversary of Namibia&#x27;s independence from South Africa in 1991. The similarity of the lyric&#x27;s first-line phrase &quot;Land of the Brave&quot; to the end of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the national anthem of the United States, has been noted by commentators.

The composition of the Namibian national anthem was supervised by Hidipo Hamutenya, then chairman of the National Symbols subcommittee. In 2006, Hamutenya claimed that he authored the lyrics himself, &quot;on the plane to Cuba&quot;. Doëseb denied this claim. In 2023, politicians Andrew Matjila and Ben Amadhila supported Hamutenya&#x27;s claim.

== Legislation ==
The Parliament of Namibia passed the National Anthem of the Republic of Namibia Act, 1991. This confirmed &quot;Namibia, Land of the Brave&quot; as the national anthem of Namibia; made it an offense to insult it, with punishment upon conviction of up to five years imprisonment or up to a 20,000-rand fine or both; and allowed the President of Namibia to create regulations relating to it.

<text>Calgary is a hamlet on the northwest coast of the Isle of Mull, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, United Kingdom. The hamlet is within the parish of Kilninian and Kilmore. It was the origin of the name of Fort Calgary in Canada, which became the city of Calgary, Alberta.

==Geography==
Calgary is situated on the B8073 about west of Dervaig, and from the island&#x27;s capital Tobermory. The settlement is a small community of houses scattered near a hotel and the Calgary Farmhouse.

The hamlet is at the eastern end of Calgary Bay and is framed by low hills, partly wooded. A broad area of machair (a grassy meadow growing on calcareous sand) lies between the land and the beach. As the tide falls a river meanders across the sands. The beach is served by a small car parking area and public toilets. It is not an official campsite but there is a designated area for short-stay wild camping in tents. Calgary Castle overlooks the bay.

==History==

The name comes from the Gaelic, &quot;Cala ghearraidh&quot;, meaning &quot;Beach of the meadow (pasture)&quot;. &quot;Cala&quot; is the word specifically used for a hard, sandy beach suitable for landing a boat, which relates plausibly to the location. However, the museum on the Isle of Mull explains that &quot;kald&quot; and &quot;gart&quot; are similar Old Norse words, meaning &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;garden&quot;, that were likely used when named by the Vikings who inhabited the Inner Hebrides. A small stone pier, originally built to allow &quot;Clyde puffers&quot; (small steam-driven cargo boats) to deliver coal to the Mornish Estate, was also used to take sheep to and from grazing on the Treshnish Isles and gives a further possible reason for the name of the bay.

Just up the hill from the pier the deserted village of Inivea remains as roofless stone ruins, an atmospheric relic of the Highland clearances. David Tennant (the former Tenth Doctor on Doctor Who) traced his family back to here in the BBC programme, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; Around 24 buildings of the township can be seen, several of them still standing to wall head level. These included houses and barns, with enclosures probably forming kailyards. A flattish area to the north, higher than the houses, shows signs of rig and furrow cultivation and a drying kiln. A rocky knoll above the houses still has the remains of a dun, though many of its stones were taken to build the houses.

On the East side of the bay Calgary House, now called Calgary Castle, was built in 1817 extending an earlier Calgary Estate laird&#x27;s house. Colonel James Macleod, Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, was a summer guest here. In 1876, shortly after returning to Canada, he suggested its name for Fort Calgary which gave rise to the city of Calgary, Alberta, a metropolis of 1,300,000.

==Literature==
The second verse of Sorley Maclean&#x27;s poem &quot;Tràighean&quot; (from Dàin do Eimhir) opens with a powerful invocation of the natural beauty of Calgary bay as symbolic of spending eternity with a loved one:

&lt;poem&gt;
Agus nan robh sinn cuideachd
air tràigh Chalgaraidh am Muile,
eadar Alba is Tiriodh,
eadar an saoghal &#x27;s a&#x27;bhiothbhuan,
dh&#x27;fhuirichinn an siud gu luan
a&#x27; tomhas gainmhich bruan air bhruan.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
And if we were together
on Calgary shore in Mull,
between Scotland and Tiree,
between the world and eternity,
I would stay there till doom,
measuring sand, grain by grain.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1058255" wikidata="Q4313244" url="?curid=1058255" title="People's Party (United States, 1971)">
<text>The People&#x27;s Party was a political party in the United States, founded in 1971 by various individuals and state and local political parties, including the Peace and Freedom Party, Commongood People&#x27;s Party, Country People&#x27;s Caucus, Human Rights Party, Liberty Union, New American Party, New Party (Arizona), and No Party. The party&#x27;s goal was to present a united anti-war platform for the coming election.

The People&#x27;s Party fielded candidates for the presidency two times: First in the 1972 US presidential election with Dr. Benjamin Spock (an American pediatrician and author of parenting books) as their candidate; then the party contested the 1976 US presidential election, with Margaret Wright as their candidate. Dr. Spock was the Party&#x27;s candidate for vice president in 1976.

After the election, the party moved to become a loose coalition, but was soon defunct, with most of its founding parties also dissolved.

The party&#x27;s papers are now in the &quot;Western Historical Manuscript Collection&quot; of the University of Missouri–St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, having been where the party had held its conventions.

After dissolution, many members joined the Citizens Party.
== History ==
=== 1972 election ===
The People&#x27;s Party ran Dr. Benjamin Spock for president and Julius Hobson for vice president in the 1972 U.S. presidential election. The party platform included free medical care, legalized abortion, legalized marijuana, a guaranteed minimum wage, the withdrawal of American troops from all foreign countries, a guaranteed maximum wage, and promoting toleration of homosexuality. Dr. Spock and the People&#x27;s Party received 78,759 votes (0.10%).

In 1976, Spock was the party&#x27;s vice presidential candidate.

=== Greer v. Spock ===
In 1972, Spock, Hobson, Linda Jenness (Socialist Workers Party presidential candidate), and Socialist Workers Party vice presidential candidate Andrew Pulley wrote to Major General Bert A. David, commanding officer of Fort Dix, asking for permission to distribute campaign literature and to hold an election-related campaign meeting. On the basis of Fort Dix regulations 210-26 and 210-27, General David refused the request. Spock, Hobson, Jenness, Pulley, and others then filed a case that ultimately made its way to the United States Supreme Court (424 U.S. 828—Greer, Commander, Fort Dix Military Reservation, et al., v. Spock et al.), which ruled against the plaintiffs. Greer v. Spock was, according to Professor Joshua E. Kastenberg, part of the Burger Court&#x27;s jurisprudence of insulating the military from non-mainstream political influences. As Spock and his contemporaries had been outspoken against the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, there was a fear that he would influence soldiers to refuse to comply with orders to deploy into combat.

=== 1976 election ===
In 1976 the People&#x27;s Party ran Margaret Wright as president and Spock this time as vice president after Maggie Kuhn declined the spot. The People&#x27;s Party received 49,016 votes (0.06%).

<text>John Roland Sweeney (June 20, 1931 – July 7, 2001) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1990. He was a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson.

==Background==
Sweeney moved to Ontario in his youth, and was educated at the University of Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master&#x27;s Degree in Education.

==Politics==
A devout Roman Catholic, Sweeney served as the Waterloo Catholic District School Board&#x27;s first director of education from 1969 until 1975.

In 1975, he ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1975 election for the riding of Kitchener—Wilmot. Sweeney defeated Progressive Conservative Morley Rosenberg by 1,745 votes. He was re-elected with increased majorities in the elections of 1977 and 1981. He sat on the opposition benches until the Liberals formed government under David Peterson following the 1985 election.

He was a candidate in the 1982 Liberal leadership convention, but was eliminated on the first ballot, finishing last in a field of five candidates with only 122 votes.

In 1985, Sweeney was easily re-elected in his own riding. He was appointed Minister of Community and Social Services on June 26, 1985. He was retained in this position following the 1987 election, and was named Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing on August 2, 1989.

In 1989, Sweeney extended the Special Services at Home (SSAH) program to adults with developmental disabilities.

Sweeney was strongly anti-abortion, and was vocal about his views on the subject. He did not support the Peterson government&#x27;s liberalization of access to abortion in the late 1980s.

Sweeney did not run in the 1990 election, although he worked as a lobbyist at Queen&#x27;s Park in the 1990s.

===Cabinet positions===

==Later life==
Out of politics, he became chair of the Canadian branch of Habitat for Humanity, and served as Chancellor of St. Jerome&#x27;s University from 1992. He was hired to examine Ontario&#x27;s education system in the 1990s, and recommended cutting the number of school boards. In 1999, Sweeney joined with Alan Redway and Marion Dewar to release &quot;Where&#x27;s Home?&quot;, a comprehensive study of housing in Ontario.

He died in 2001, aged 70, from a heart attack, having survived several such attacks in the past. He left his wife, Kay, and their 10 children. There is a John Sweeney Catholic Elementary School in Kitchener, Ontario named after him.

<text>What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone is the second novel in the Canadian writer Robertson Davies&#x27; Cornish Trilogy. It is the life story of Francis or Frank Cornish, whose death and will were the starting point for the first novel, &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;.

==Plot==

After a brief framing scene among characters from &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;, the novel turns to a conversation between the Recording Angel and the daimon in charge of Cornish&#x27;s life. The main part of the book is that life as narrated by the Recording Angel, interspersed with comments in which the daimon explains how he worked to make Cornish a great man.

We follow Cornish&#x27;s life from his two Canadian grandparents – part of &quot;what&#x27;s bred in the bone&quot; – through his childhood as a wealthy and precocious misfit in a small Ontario town, his education in Toronto and Oxford, his unusual apprenticeship as a restorer and painter in Nazi Germany, his wartime experiences in England, his postwar work with a group resembling the Monuments Men, and his collecting and patronage of the arts in Toronto. A repeated theme in his mature years is art forgery.

Cornish&#x27;s daimon believes that people develop through adversity and provides Cornish with plenty, most obviously at the hands of his childhood classmates and his artistic master in Germany, but also in two love affairs and in a friendship with a young man who in some ways is Cornish&#x27;s apprentice. Another form of adversity is Cornish&#x27;s situation as a talented artist whose interests and skills are out of fashion.

First published by Macmillan of Canada in 1985, &quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; was on the shortlist for the 1986 Booker Prize.

&quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; is the second novel of the &quot;Cornish Trilogy&quot;. It was followed by &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;. It is also connected to earlier novels; when Cornish is at school in Toronto, one of his teachers is Dunstan Ramsay from the Deptford Trilogy. There are many parallels to be found in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;.

<doc id="1058268" wikidata="Q7753363" url="?curid=1058268" title="The Needles Batteries">
<text>The Needles Batteries are two military batteries built above the Needles stacks to guard the West end of the Solent. The field of fire was from approximately West South West clockwise to Northeast and they were designed to defend against enemy ships.

==Old Battery==

The Old Battery was constructed between 1861 and 1863. It was equipped with six 7-inch Armstrong rifled breechloading guns. These were replaced by four 7-inch and two 9-inch rifled muzzle loaders in 1872, and six 9-inch rifled muzzle loaders in 1893. The 9 inch guns took a team of 9 men to load and fire. These guns fired projectiles weighing . The 9-inch guns remained in place until 1903 when they were discarded by throwing them over the side of the cliff. These were later recovered and two are now on display at the Old Battery.

A deep ditch with a retractable bridge was dug into the chalk to protect the facility from ground attack from the island side. In 1885 a tunnel was dug towards the cliff face from the parade grounds. An elevator down to the beach was completed in 1887. Early searchlight experiments were conducted at the site between 1889 and 1892. The present observation post housing a searchlight was built in 1899. Just to the east of the Old Battery, at Hatherwood Point are the remains of Hatherwood Battery, built to defend the area alongside the Needles Battery. The Old Battery is a Grade II Listed Building.

A tunnel leads to a searchlight emplacement with good views towards the Needles lighthouse.

==New Battery==
There were subsidence problems and concerns that the concussion from firing the guns was causing the cliffs to crumble. This was solved by building the New Battery higher up the cliff, at a height of 120 metres above sea level. The New Battery was completed in 1895. Three 9.2-inch Mk IX breech-loading guns were installed at the New Battery: two in 1900 and a third in 1903. A crew of 11 was required to fire one of these guns. Each shell weighed . The New Battery guns remained in place until 1954, when they were scrapped.

The Old and New Batteries were manned during the World Wars. German U-boats sank two ships off The Needles during World War I. This facility was also the site of early trials of anti-aircraft guns. In World War II, anti-aircraft guns defended the Isle of Wight against air attacks but repeated German air attacks necessitated improvements in the fortifications at the site. Troops trained for the D-Day landing on the neighbouring cliffs. After the war, the Ministry of Defence deactivated the batteries.

In the 1950s, test stands near the battery were used for testing the Blue Streak missile, as well as the Black Knight and Black Arrow satellite launch vehicles. Like the Old Battery, the New Battery has also been listed at Grade II. The surviving parts of the rocket testing facilities are a scheduled monument.

==National Trust opening==

When the site came into the possession of the National Trust, it was decided to restore the Old Battery so that it could be opened to the general public. The National Trust Youth Group comprising local schoolchildren and teachers assisted in preparing the site for its official opening in 1982. The site is still managed by the National Trust and is open daily from mid-March to the end of October. It gives visitors an insight into how a Victorian battery would work and giving a glimpse into the life of a soldier based at the Battery during the Second World War. Along with a series of exhibition rooms and the tunnel there are a number of visitor facilities including a tearoom. The New Battery was opened to the public in 2004 and has a display on the history of the British rocket development between the 1950s and 1970s.

<text>Richard Lemon Lander (8 February 1804 – 6 February 1834) was a British explorer of western Africa. He and his brother John were the first Europeans to follow the course of the River Niger, and discover that it led to the Atlantic.

==Biography==
Lander was the son of John Lander, a Truro innkeeper and noted wrestler, and was born in the Fighting Cocks Inn (later the Dolphin Inn). Educated at &quot;Old Pascoe&#x27;s&quot; in Coombs Lane, Truro, until 1817 when, aged 13, he accompanied a merchant to the West Indies, where he suffered an attack of yellow fever in San Domingo. Returning home in 1818, he gained employment as a servant to several wealthy London families with whom he travelled in Europe.

Lander&#x27;s explorations began as a servant to the Scottish explorer Hugh Clapperton with whom he went in 1823 to the Cape Colony, and then on to an expedition to Western Africa in 1825. Clapperton died on 13 April 1827 near Sokoto, in present-day Nigeria, leaving Lander as the only surviving European member of the expedition. He proceeded southeast to Kano and from there decided to travel south to Panda (misspelt Funda) on the Benue River which led him to becoming the first European to visit the important town of Zangon Katab whose people, the Atyap he described in his notes before returning through the Yoruba region to the coast and thence Britain in July 1828.

Commissioned by the British Government, Lander returned to West Africa in 1830, accompanied by his brother John. They landed at Badagri on 22 March 1830 and followed the lower River Niger from Bussa to the sea. After exploring about 160 kilometres of the River Niger upstream, they returned to explore by canoe the River Benue and Niger Delta. In the delta they were kidnapped by the locals at Aboh, and a large ransom was demanded by the local king Obi Ossai of Aboh kingdom, which was paid. The Lander Brothers were ransomed by Kingboy Amain, the heir to his father King Forday Kulo of Nembe Brass Kingdom, a Kingdom involved deeply in the oil palm trade and slave trade between the hinterland and critical to British interests, in present day Bayelsa State.

Kingboy Amain took them to Nembe and  they arrived on Monday, 15 November 1830.

A few days later, on the 17th, Richard was taken to Akassa at the Nun estuary of the Niger River to persuade an English merchant Captain Luke, to repay the ransom along with other gifts paid by Kingboy Amain while John remained in Nembe between 17 and 23 November. John joined his brother Richard at the Nun estuary of the Niger at Akassa and subsequently sailed back to Britain.

The Lander Brothers admitted that the ransom was never paid back yet they were granted safe passage back to a British ship in their Journal despite the displeasure of Kingboy Amain in the Captain not repaying his money. He was instrumental in their safety and return.

Despite this setback, they were successful in determining the great river&#x27;s course and termination. They travelled back to Britain from Fernando Po via Rio de Janeiro in 1831.

In 1832, Lander returned to Africa for a third and final time, as leader of an expedition organised by Macgregor Laird and other Liverpudlian merchants, with the intention of founding a trading settlement at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers, using two armed paddle steamers, the &quot;Quorra&quot; and the &quot;Alburkah&quot;. However, the expedition encountered difficulties, many personnel died from fever, and it failed to reach Bussa. While journeying upstream in a canoe, Lander was attacked by natives and wounded by a musket ball in his thigh. He managed to return to the coast but, the bullet being too deep to remove, gangrene set in, and he died. He was buried in the Clarence cemetery in Fernando Po. He was survived by his wife and daughter. According to a document in the John Holt papers in the Bodleian library (mss air s 1525 Box 11 folder3 p 8) the musket ball is in the Rotunda museum of artillery at Woolwich (Object Class XXX No 172 presented by Col Nichols RM, at whose house Lander died).

===Legacy===

In Truro, Lander&#x27;s Monument by English sculptor Neville Northey Burnard stands at the top of Lemon Street, and Richard Lander School is named in his honour, as is housing estate Trelander which in Cornish means home or town of Lander.The building of the column commenced in 1835. In 1832 he became the first winner of the Royal Geographical Society Founder&#x27;s Medal, &quot;for important services in determining the course and termination of the Niger&quot;.
To mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Richard Lander and celebrate the Lander brothers&#x27; achievements an &quot;Expedition of Goodwill&quot; was sent in November 2004 to retrace their river journey.

<doc id="1058277" wikidata="Q7345398" url="?curid=1058277" title="Robert Henderson (writer)">
<text>Robert Henderson (born 1947) is an English writer who has caused public controversy with his views on racial issues and his letters to the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He lives in Central London.

Henderson spent his early childhood in Cheshire before moving to Hertfordshire, where he was educated at St Albans School, later graduating from Keele University. Before retiring due to ill health, he worked for the Inland Revenue, while also retaining a strong personal interest in cricket.

== Controversy ==

=== Cricket ===

In 1995 he became the subject of attention from the British media after &quot;Wisden Cricket Monthly&quot; published his essay &quot;Is It In The Blood?&quot;, which used language such as &quot;negro&quot; and implied that foreign-born, black and Asian players would be less committed to the team. A legal action taken against &quot;Wisden&quot; by black England cricketers Devon Malcolm and Phillip DeFreitas was settled out of court.

=== Tony Blair ===

Henderson claimed media bias against him together with censorship of his views and wrote a number of letters to his constituency Labour MP, Frank Dobson, and later to Tony Blair (then the opposition leader) and also to 
Blair&#x27;s wife Cherie. In March 1997 Blair is said to have contacted the police asking for a means to stop this &quot;pestering&quot;; on 25 March 1997, a story accusing Henderson explicitly of &quot;pestering&quot; the Blairs appeared on the front page of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Henderson has frequently claimed that Special Branch and the security services have, on Blair&#x27;s instructions, interfered with his mail and tapped his telephone.

Sir Richard Body, a Conservative MP, put forward an Early day motion in support of Henderson.

Henderson has written most frequently in recent years for the political magazine &quot;Right Now!&quot; and the English nationalist/cultural magazine &quot;Steadfast&quot;. &quot;Right Now&quot;, which ceased publication in 2006, could be described as of the Old Right, while &quot;Steadfast&quot;, which also appears to have ceased publication, had wider political appeal (and was becoming increasingly &quot;green&quot;). He has not written for &quot;Wisden&quot; since the 1995 controversy. With the demise of his domestic outlets Henderson began submitting his writings to the American white supremacist publication &quot;American Renaissance&quot;. He also writes an internet blog entitled &quot;England Calling&quot;, where he espouses English supremacist viewpoints and gives indications of his close dealings with the BNP.

<text>Albert Nelson (April 25, 1923 – December 21, 1992), known by his stage name Albert King, was an American guitarist and singer who is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential blues guitarists of all time. He is perhaps best known for his popular and influential album &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot; (1967) and its title track. He, B. B. King, and Freddie King, all unrelated, were known as the &quot;Three Kings of the Blues&quot;. The left-handed Albert King was known for his &quot;deep, dramatic sound that was widely imitated by both blues and rock guitarists&quot;.

He was once nicknamed &quot;The Velvet Bulldozer&quot; because of his smooth singing and large size – he stood taller than average, with sources reporting or , and weighed – and also because he drove a bulldozer in one of his day jobs early in his career.

King was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1983. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2023, he was ranked number 22 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.

== Early life ==
Albert King was born on a cotton plantation in Indianola, Mississippi. During childhood he sang at a church with a family gospel group, in which his father played the guitar. One of 13 children, he grew up picking cotton on plantations near Forrest City, Arkansas, where the family moved when he was eight years old.

King&#x27;s identity was a longtime source of confusion. He stated in interviews that he was born in Indianola on April 25, 1923 (or 1924), and was a half-brother of B.B. King (whose hometown was Indianola), but documentation suggests otherwise. King stated that whenever he performed at Club Ebony in Indianola, the event was celebrated as a homecoming, and he cited the fact that B.B.&#x27;s father was named Albert King. However, when he applied for a Social Security card in 1942, he gave his birthplace as &quot;Aboden&quot; (most likely Aberdeen, Mississippi) and signed his name as Albert Nelson, listing his father as Will Nelson. Musicians also knew him as Albert Nelson in the 1940s and early 1950s.

He started using the name Albert King in 1953 as an attempt to be associated with B.B King; he was billed as &quot;B.B. King&#x27;s brother&quot;. He also used the same nickname as B.B King, &quot;Blues Boy&quot;, and he named his guitar &quot;Lucy&quot; (B.B. King&#x27;s guitar was named &quot;Lucille&quot;). B.B. King later said: &quot;He called his guitar &#x27;Lucy,&#x27; and for a while he went around saying he was my brother. That bothered me until I got to know him and realized he was right; he wasn&#x27;t my brother in blood, but he sure was my brother in the blues.&quot;

According to King, his father left the family when Albert was five, and when he was eight he moved with his mother, Mary Blevins, and two sisters to an area near Forrest City, Arkansas. He said his family had also lived in Arcola, Mississippi, for a time. He made his first guitar out of a cigar box, a piece of a bush, and a strand of broom wire. He later bought a real guitar for $1.25. As a left-hander learning guitar on his own, he turned his guitar upside down. He picked cotton, drove a bulldozer, worked in construction, and held other jobs until he was able to support himself as a musician.

== Career ==
King began his professional work as a musician with a group called the Groove Boys in Osceola, Arkansas. During this time he was exposed to the work of many Delta blues artists, including Elmore James and Robert Nighthawk.

In 1953, he moved north to Gary, Indiana where he briefly played drums in Jimmy Reed&#x27;s band and on several of Reed&#x27;s early recordings. In Gary, he recorded his first single (&quot;Bad Luck Blues&quot; backed with &quot;Be On Your Merry Way&quot;), for Parrot Records. The record sold a few copies, but made no significant impact and Parrot did not request any follow-up records or sign King to a long-term contract. In 1954, he returned to Osceola and re-joined the Groove Boys for two years.

In 1956, he moved to Brooklyn, Illinois, just across the river from St. Louis, and formed a new band. He became a popular attraction around the St. Louis nightclub scene alongside Ike Turner&#x27;s Kings of Rhythm and Chuck Berry. He signed to Little Milton&#x27;s Bobbin label in 1959, releasing a few singles, but none of them charted. However, he caught the attention of King Records which released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Your Love on Me So Strong&quot; in November 1961. The recording features musician Ike Turner on piano and became King&#x27;s first hit; peaking at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. The song was included on his first album &quot;The Big Blues&quot; in 1962. King left Bobbin in late 1962 and recorded one session for King Records. In 1963, He signed with jazz artist Leo Gooden&#x27;s Coun-Tree label and cut two records for them, but these failed to chart.

With no apparent career prospects other than touring the club circuit in the South and Midwest, King moved to Memphis, where he signed with the Stax record label. Produced by Al Jackson Jr., King with Booker T. &amp; the MGs recorded dozens of influential sides, such as &quot;Crosscut Saw&quot; and &quot;As the Years Go Passing By&quot;. In 1967, Stax released the album &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;, a collection of the singles King recorded at Stax. The title track of that album (written by Booker T. Jones and William Bell) became King&#x27;s best-known song and has been covered by several artists (including Cream, Paul Rodgers, and Jimi Hendrix). The production of the songs was sparse and clean and maintained a traditional blues sound while also sounding fresh and thoroughly contemporary. The key to King&#x27;s success at Stax was giving his songs an upbeat, slick R&amp;B feel that made the songs more appealing and radio-friendly than the slow, maudlin traditional blues sound.
 In 1968, King was performing at Ike Turner&#x27;s Manhattan Club in East St. Louis when promoter Bill Graham offered him $1,600 to play three nights at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco. He released the albums &quot;Live Wire/Blues Power&quot;, &quot;Wednesday Night in San Francisco&quot; and &quot;Thursday Night in San Francisco&quot; from the concerts.

In 1969, King performed live with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. That same year, he released the album &quot;Years Gone By&quot;. In 1970, he released an Elvis Presley tribute album, &quot;Albert King Does the King&#x27;s Things.&quot; It was a collection of Presley&#x27;s 1950s hits reworked and re-imagined in King&#x27;s musical style, although critics felt the results were mixed.

On June 6, 1970, King joined The Doors on stage at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, Canada. Recordings of this performance were released in 2010 by Rhino Records as &quot;Live in Vancouver 1970&quot;.

In 1971, he released the album &quot;Lovejoy&quot; which notably includes a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; hit &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;. To retain his popular appeal, King eagerly embraced the new sound of funk. In 1972, he recorded &quot;I&#x27;ll Play the Blues for You&quot;, which featured accompaniment from the Bar-Kays, the Memphis Horns, and the Movement (Isaac Hayes&#x27;s backing group). He recorded another album with the Bar-Kays, &quot;I Wanna Get Funky&quot; (1974). He also made a cameo on an Albert Brooks&#x27; comedy album, &quot;A Star Is Bought&quot; (1975).

In 1975, King&#x27;s career took a turn downward when Stax Records filed for bankruptcy, after which he moved to the small Utopia label. His next two albums, &quot;Albert&quot; and &quot;Truckload of Lovin″&quot; (1976), devolved into generic 1970s pop music. His third album for Utopia, &quot;King Albert&quot; (1977), while somewhat more subdued, still lacked any standout material, and King&#x27;s guitar took a backseat to the background instruments. Clara McDaniel teamed up with King at Ned Love&#x27;s Club. This led to her touring with King in the Deep South in the 1970s. When McDaniel returned home she managed King&#x27;s fleet of taxicabs. The last recording King made for Utopia was &quot;Live Blues&quot; in 1977, from his performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival. The track &quot;As the Years Go Passing By&quot; is noteworthy for his duet with the Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher.

In 1978, King moved to a new label, Tomato Records, for which he recorded the album &quot;New Orleans Heat&quot;. The label paired him with the R&amp;B producer Allen Toussaint, who had been responsible for scores of hits in that genre in the 1960s and 1970s but was a novice at working with blues artists. The album was a mix of new songs (including Toussaint&#x27;s own &quot;Get Out of My Life, Woman&quot;) and re-recordings of old material, such as &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;.

King took a four-year break from recording after the disappointing sales of his albums in the late 1970s. During this period, he re-embraced his roots as a blues artist and abandoned any arrangements except straight 12-bar guitar, bass, drums, and piano. In 1983, he released a live album for Fantasy Records, &quot;San Francisco &#x27;83,&quot; which was nominated for a Grammy Award. The same year he recorded a studio television session, more than an hour long, for CHCH Television in Canada, featuring the up-and-coming blues sensation Stevie Ray Vaughan; it was subsequently released as an audio album and later as an audio album plus DVD titled &quot;In Session&quot;.

In 1984, King released the album, &quot;I&#x27;m in a Phone Booth, Baby&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. The album included a redo of &quot;Truckload of Lovin&#x27;&quot; and two old songs by Elmore James, &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; and &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;.

King&#x27;s health problems led him to consider retirement in the 1980s, but he continued regular tours and appearances at blues festivals, using a customized Greyhound tour bus with &quot;I&#x27;ll Play The Blues For You&quot; painted on the side. His final album, &quot;Red House&quot; (named after the Jimi Hendrix song) was released in 1991.

At the time of his death, he was planning a tour with B.B. King and Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland. Bland told the Associated Press, &quot;there was never any type of jealousy when we three worked together on a package. One just pushed the others.&quot;

== Death ==
King died of a heart attack on December 21, 1992, in his Memphis home. His final concert had been in Los Angeles two days earlier. He was given a funeral procession with the Memphis Horns playing &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot; and was buried in Paradise Gardens Cemetery in Edmondson, Arkansas, near his childhood home.

King was survived by his wife, Glendle; two daughters, Evelyn Smith and Gloria Randolph; a son, Donald Randolph; a sister, Elvie Wells; eight grandchildren, and ten great-grandchildren.

==Artistry==

=== Instruments ===

King&#x27;s first instrument was a diddley bow. Next, he built himself a cigar box guitar, and eventually he bought a Guild acoustic guitar. The instrument he is usually associated with is a 1958 Gibson Flying V. In 1974 he began using a Flying V built by Dan Erlewine, and after 1980 he also played one built by Bradley Prokopow. After 1987, Albert played a custom Archtop Flying V, built by Tom Holmes upon commission from Billy Gibbons, it was given to King for his 65th birthday. Around 2017, this guitar was sold by Gruhn Guitars to an unknown collector.

King was left-handed, but usually played right-handed guitars flipped over upside-down. He used a dropped open tuning, possibly more than one, as reports vary: (C#-G#-B-E-G#-C#) or open E-minor (C-B-E-G-B-E) or open F (C-F-C-F-A-D). Steve Cropper (who played rhythm guitar on many of King&#x27;s Stax sessions), told &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine that King tuned his guitar to C-B-E-F#-B-E (low to high). The luthier Dan Erlewine said King tuned to C-F-C-F-A-D with light-gauge strings (0.050&quot;, 0.038&quot;, 0.028&quot;, 0.024&quot; wound, 0.012&quot;, 0.009&quot;). The lighter-gauge strings, and lower string tension of the dropped tuning, were factors in King&#x27;s string-bending technique.

For amplification, King used a solid-state Acoustic amplifier, with a speaker cabinet containing two 15-inch speakers and a horn (&quot;which may or may not have been operative&quot;). From the 1980s onwards King was also known to use a Roland JC-120. Later in his career he also used an MXR Phase 90.

=== Influence ===
King influenced other guitarists, including Jimi Hendrix, Mick Taylor, Derek Trucks, Duane Allman, Eric Clapton, Warren Haynes, Mike Bloomfield and Joe Walsh (the James Gang guitarist spoke at King&#x27;s funeral). He also influenced his contemporaries Albert Collins and Otis Rush. He was often cited by Stevie Ray Vaughan as having been his greatest influence. Eric Clapton has said that his work on the 1967 Cream hit &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and throughout the album &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; was inspired by King.

== Accolades ==
Over the course of his career, King was nominated for two Grammy awards. In 1983, he was nominated for Best Traditional Blues album for &quot;San Francisco&quot; &quot;&#x27;83&quot; and the next year he was also nominated for &quot;I&#x27;m In A Phone Booth, Baby.&quot;

In 1983, King was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. He received a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 1993. In 2011, King was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in his hometown Indianola. He was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2013.

King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. At the induction ceremony, Gary Clark Jr. performed King&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; and was then joined by John Mayer and Booker T. Jones to perform King&#x27;s &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;.

<text>The Sanctus (, &quot;Holy&quot;) is a hymn in Christian liturgy. It may also be called the epinikios hymnos (, &quot;Hymn of Victory&quot;) when referring to the Greek rendition and parts of it are sometimes called &quot;Benedictus&quot;. Tersanctus (Latin: &quot;Thrice Holy&quot;) is another, rarer name for the Sanctus. The same name is sometimes used for the &quot;Trisagion&quot;.

In Western Christianity, the &quot;Sanctus&quot; forms part of the Ordinary and is sung (or said) as the final words of the Preface of the Eucharistic Prayer of remembrance, consecration, and praise. The preface, which alters according to the season, usually concludes with words describing the praise of the worshippers joining with the angels, who are pictured as praising God with the words of the &quot;Sanctus&quot;.
In the Byzantine Rite and general Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the &quot;Sanctus&quot; is offered as a response by the choir during the Holy Anaphora.

==Text==

===In Greek===
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hágios, hágios, hágios, Kýrios Sabaṓth; plḗrēs ho ouranós kaí hē gê tês dóxēs sou, hōsanná en toîs hupsístois. Eulogēménos ho erkhómenos en onómati Kyríou. Hōsanná (ho) en toîs hupsístois.&quot;

In the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and the Liturgy of St. Basil:
&lt;poem&gt;
Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος Κύριος Σαβαώθ·
πλήρης ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ τῆς δόξης σου,
ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.
Εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου.
Ὡσαννὰ ὁ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.

&quot;Hágios, hágios, hágios, Kýrios Sabaṓth;&quot;
&quot;plḗrēs ho ouranós kaí hē gê tês dóxēs sou,&quot;
&quot;hōsanná en toîs hupsístois.&quot;
&quot;Eulogēménos ho erkhómenos en onómati Kyríou.&quot;
&quot;Hōsanná ho en toîs hupsístois.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the Liturgy of St. James:
&lt;poem&gt;
Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος Κύριος Σαβαώθ.
Πλήρης ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ τῆς δόξης σου.
Ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.
Εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου.
Ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.

&quot;Hágios, hágios, hágios, Kýrios Sabaṓth.&quot;
&quot;Plḗrēs ho ouranós kaí hē gê tês dóxēs sou.&quot;
&quot;Hōsanná en toîs hupsístois.&quot;
&quot;Eulogēménos ho erkhómenos en onómati Kyríou.&quot;
&quot;Hōsanná ho en toîs hupsístois.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

===In Latin===
In the Roman Rite:
&lt;poem&gt;
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus
Dominus Deus Sabaoth.
Pleni sunt cæli et terra gloria tua.
Hosanna in excelsis.
Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini.
Hosanna in excelsis.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the Roman Rite, the &quot;Sanctus&quot; also forms part of the solemn hymn of praise &quot;Te Deum laudamus&quot;, but with the addition of a reference to the &quot;majesty&quot; of the Lord&#x27;s glory in the &quot;Pleni sunt&quot; verse (the phrase &quot;pleni sunt caeli et terra gloria tua&quot; becomes &quot;pleni sunt caeli et terra maiestatis gloriae tuae&quot;). The &quot;Benedictus&quot; is not included in the &quot;Te Deum&quot;, and the Sanctus is therefore included as part of that hymn as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth.
Pleni sunt cæli et terra maiestatis gloriæ tuæ.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the Mozarabic Rite:
&lt;poem&gt;
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus,
Dominus Deus Sabaoth:
Pleni sunt cæli et terra gloria maiestatis tuæ,
Hosanna filio David.
Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini.
Hosanna in excelsis.
Hagios, hagios, hagios Kyrie o Theos.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===In English===
The Sanctus appears thus in the 1549 Book of Common Prayer (and as set to music by John Merbecke in 1550):
&lt;poem&gt;
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of thy glory
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord:
Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.

&lt;/poem&gt;

In the 1552 Book of Common Prayer and 1559 BCP it appears without the Benedictus:
&lt;poem&gt;
Holy, holy, holy, lord god of hostes,
heven and earth are ful of thy glory,
glory be to the, O Lord most hyghe.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The 1662 BCP has it thus:

Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hoſts,
heaven and earth are full of thy glory;
Glory be to thee, O Lord Moſt High.

Later Anglican prayer books following the ritualist and liturgical movements of the twentieth century, restored the Benedictus to this form, yielding:&lt;poem&gt;
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,
heaven and earth are full of thy glory.
Glory be to thee, O Lord most high.
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The following English version was used by most Lutherans in North America until 1978 when the ICET version was adopted in the &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot;. This traditional version has continued to be used in the Divine Service of the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod:
&lt;poem&gt;
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth;
heaven and earth are full of thy glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord
Hosanna in the highest.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1973 the International Consultation on English Texts (ICET) produced an ecumenical version that at that time was adopted by Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and others:
&lt;poem&gt;
Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Since 2011 the Roman Missal in English has:
&lt;poem&gt;
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===In Coptic===
As part of the Alexandrian rite, the &quot;Benedictus&quot; is not present in the Liturgy of Saint Cyril:
&lt;poem&gt;
Αγιος, αγιος, αγιος.
Ⲭⲟⲩⲁⲃ `Ⲡϭⲟⲓⲥ ⲥⲁⲃⲁⲱⲑ:
`ⲧⲫⲉ ⲛⲉⲙ `ⲡⲕⲁϩⲓ ⲙⲉϩ ⲉⲃⲟⲗϧⲉⲛ ⲡⲉⲕⲱⲟⲩ
ⲉⲑⲟⲩⲁⲃ `Ⲡϭⲟⲓⲥ Ⲡⲉⲛⲛⲟⲩϯ.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Sources==
As Enrico Mazza writes:
The &quot;Sanctus&quot; became part of the Roman Eucharistic Prayer only in the first half of the fifth century; all in all, this was a fairly late period, inasmuch as by then the text of the Roman Canon had become fixed and was regarded as a text possessing great authority.

There exist two fundamental types of Sanctus: the Alexandrian and the Antiochene. The Sanctus of the Roman Eucharist derives from the Antiochene liturgy and has two parts: (a) the Sanctus true and proper, consisting of the acclamation from Isaiah 6:3; and (b) the &quot;Benedictus&quot;, a christological acclamation taken from Matthew 21:9. The Sanctus has been given a christological interpretation and a trinitarian interpretation, and this in both the East and the West. These differing interpretations may be due to the presence, in the text of the Sanctus, of a theological section, namely, the acclamation from Isaiah 6:3, and a christological part, namely the acclamation from Matthew 21:9.

The text of the Sanctus passed from Jewish use to Christian use at a very early time, since it is cited in the Apocalypse of John and in the letter of Clement to the Corinthians.

As can be read in the same source, in the Alexandrian tradition on the other hand,
the Sanctus consisted of only the first part, the citation of Isaiah 6:3, and lacked the &quot;Benedictus&quot;; this was the earliest form taken by the Sanctus in the Eucharist. This early state can be seen in the testimonies of Eusebius of Caesarea, the &quot;Mystagogical Catecheses&quot; of Cyril of Jerusalem, and, above all, the &quot;Ritual&quot; used in the Church of Theodore of Mopsuestia. In the latter, too, that is, in the archaic stage of the Syrian liturgy, the &quot;Benedictus&quot; was unknown, and the Sanctus consisted solely of the acclamation from Isaiah 6:3.

The first part of the Sanctus, the adaptation from , describes the prophet Isaiah&#x27;s vision of the throne of God surrounded by six-winged, ministering seraphim. A similar representation is found in . In Jewish liturgy, the verse from Isaiah is uttered by the congregation during Kedusha, a prayer said during the leader&#x27;s repetition of the Amidah (18 Benedictions):
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh Adonai Tz&#x27;vaot&quot;
&quot;Melo Kol Haaretz Kevodo.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The text of the second part, beginning with the word &quot;Benedictus&quot; (Latin for &quot;Blessed&quot;) is taken from , describes Jesus&#x27; Entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, which is in turn based on the first half of Psalm 118:26. In its present liturgical context &quot;it points to the expected presence of the Lord in the eucharistic gifts&quot;. Within Anglicanism, the 1552 Book of Common Prayer omitted it and, though it is now permitted, &quot;the choice whether or not to use the &quot;Benedictus&quot; is still for some a matter of Eucharistic theology and churchmanship&quot;.

The Sanctus appears in the Sacramentary of Serapion of Thmuis (the saint died in 360), but may go as far back to Christian liturgy in North Africa in the year 200.

==Hymn forms in Eastern liturgies==
The present form of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the primary liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church, reads (when in Greek) the following text:
&lt;poem&gt;Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος Κύριος Σαβαώθ· πλήρης ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ τῆς δόξης σου, ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις. Εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου. Ὡσαννὰ ὁ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.

&quot;Hágios, hágios, hágios Kýrios Sabaṓth; plḗrēs ho ouranós kaí hē gê tês dóxēs sou, hōsanná en toîs hupsístois. Eulogēménos ho erkhómenos en onómati Kyríou. Hōsanná ho en toîs hupsístois.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The above differs from the Roman Rite Latin text
*in that the Latin adds to the word &quot;&quot; (Lord), which is the regular Latin translation of יהוה, the &quot;&quot; (God), which is found in neither the Greek nor the Latin translations nor in the original text of Isaiah 6:3, but is found in : &quot;Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!&quot;
*in that the Latin has the plural &quot;&quot;, and the Greek the singular for the mention of &quot;heaven&quot;, which appears in neither the Latin nor the Greek translation of Isaiah 6:3.
*in that the Greek gives two different forms of the phrase corresponding to &quot; in excelsis&quot;, the second one including an article. The article is not found in Matthew 21:9. The form of the hymn without the article is also used in the Greek Liturgy of Saint James, and in modern settings, practises and contexts.

The Liturgy of Saint Basil of the Eastern Orthodox Church has the same form of the Sanctus as the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, with its two variants of the Hosanna phrase.

In older Greek liturgical manuscripts, various forms of the hymn are attested; the ones that will follow below, belong to the ones edited by Swainson in his 1884 book &quot;The Greek liturgies&quot;. Among these forms, there are variations of the hymn being composed of practically only the Old testament part. Others include:&lt;br&gt;
In the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, one of them excludes not only the article , but also the article «τῆς»:
&lt;poem&gt;Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος, Κύριος Σαβαώθ· πλήρης ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ δόξης σου. Ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις· εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου· ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.

&quot;Hágios, hágios, hágios, Kýrios Sabaṓth; plḗrēs ho ouranós kaí hē gê dóxēs sou. Hōsanná en toîs hupsístois; eulogēménos ho erkhómenos en onómati Kyríou; hōsanná en toîs hupsístois.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Liturgy of Saint James as given in Swainson reads as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος, Κύριε σαβαώθ· πλήρης ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ τῆς δόξης σου· ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις. Eὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου· ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.

&quot;Hágios, hágios, hágios, Kýrie sabaṓth. Plḗrēs ho ouranós kaí hē gê tês dóxēs sou; hōsanná en toîs hupsístois. Eulogēménos ho erkhómenos en onómati Kyríou; hōsanná en toîs hupsístois.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

This text not only omits the article that is used in the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, but also has &quot;Kyrie&quot; (vocative case) where the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom has &quot;Kyrios&quot; (nominative).

In current use, the Liturgy of Saint James may use the nominative rather than the vocative case of ; the article is also not present in this form at the concluding &quot;Hosanna&quot;.

Moreover, a different variant of the Liturgy of Saint James is found in the margin of a manuscript that gives only the three words in the body: &quot;In the margin, much abbreviated, may be discerned the following: This produces the text:
&lt;poem&gt;Ἅγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος, Κύριος σαβαώθ, πλήρης ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ τῆς δόξης σου· ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις. Εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐλθὼν καὶ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου· ὡσαννὰ ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις.

&quot;Hágios, hágios, hágios, Kýrios Sabaṓth, plḗrēs ho ouranós kaí hē gê tês dóxēs sou; hōsanná en toîs hupsístois. Eulogēménos ho elthṓn kaí erkhómenos en onómati Kyríou; hōsanná en toîs hupsístois.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

This version adds &quot;he who came and&quot; before &quot;he who comes&quot;; in this it resembles the Liturgy of Saint James in the tradition of the Syriac Orthodox Church:
&lt;poem&gt;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty; heaven and earth are full of His glories. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is He Who came and will come in the Name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Syriac Orthodox Church also has what it calls the &quot;Liturgy of Saint Dionysius&quot;, in which the Hosanna phrase appears only at the end:
&lt;poem&gt;Holy Holy Holy, Lord of Sabbaoth, Heaven and Earth are full of Thy Glory. Blessed is He that cometh in the Lord&#x27;s Name; Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/poem&gt;

The form used in the ancient Liturgy of Addai and Mari is much shorter:
 &lt;poem&gt; ܩܲܕܝܫ: ܩܲܕܝܼܫ: ܩܲܕܝܼܫ: ܡܵܪܝܵܐ ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ ܚܲܝܠܬ݂ܵܢܵܐ: ܕܲܡܠܹܝܢ ܫ̈ܡܲܝܵܐ ܘܐܲܪܥܵܐ ܡܸܢ ܬܸܫ̈ܒ݁ܚܵܬܹܗ: ܘܡܸܢ ܟܝܵܢ ܐܝܼܬ݂ܘܼܬܹܗ: ܘܡܸܢ ܗܸܕ݂ܪܵܐ ܕܙܝܼܘܹܗ ܡܫܲܒ݁ܚܵܐ܀ ܐܘܿܫܲܥܢܵܐ ܒܲܡܪ̈ܲܘܡܹܐ: ܐܘܿܫܲܥܢܵܐ ܠܲܒ݂ܪܹܗ ܕܕ݂ܵܘܝܼܕ݂: ܒܪܝܼܟ݂ ܕܐܸܬ݂ܵܐ ܘܐܵܬܹܐ ܒܲܫܡܹܗ ܕܡܵܪܝܵܐ: ܐܘܿܫܲܥܢܵܐ ܒܲܡܪ̈ܲܘܡܹܐ.

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord is the Lord God of hosts, for heaven and earth are full of his praises, and of the nature of his being, and for the excellency of his glorious splendor. Hosanna in the heights. Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is he who came and will come in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the heights.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Coptic version of the Liturgy of Saint Basil also gives a short text of what it calls the &quot;Hymn of the Seraphim&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of hosts; Heaven and earth are full of Your holy glory.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Alternative ancient names and ancient secrecy===
The priest&#x27;s introductions, following the rubrics that set what should be done by whom with each passage, uniformly call the hymn the , i.e. &quot;the hymn of victory&quot;. On the other hand, it used to be that, as Swainson notes about an attested variant form wherein only is being quoted:
In the margin, much abbreviated, may be discerned the following: &#x27;. Chrysostom frequently refers to this: sometimes as &#x27;; sometimes as &#x27;; sometimes as the &#x27;. The knowledge of it as a whole was confined to the faithful.

:&quot;Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth; pleni sunt coeli et terra gloria tua&quot;
::Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hosts; Heaven and earth are full of Your glory.
:&quot;Hosanna in excelsis&quot;
::Hosanna in the highest
:&quot;Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini.&quot;
::Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord
:&quot;Hosanna in excelsis&quot;

==Musical settings==

The Sanctus has been set to numerous plainchant melodies, many of which are given in the Roman Missal, and many more composers have set it to polyphonic music, both in single settings and as part of cyclic mass settings.

Parts of the Hymn have also been used in modern music, notably &quot;Prism of Life&quot; by Enigma (album Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!)

==Accompanying gestures==
In the Tridentine Mass the priest joins his hands while saying the word &quot;Sanctus&quot; and then, bowing, continues to recite the whole of the Sanctus in a lower voice, while a small bell is rung; then, on reaching the words &quot;Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini&quot;, he stands erect again and makes the Sign of the Cross. He then continues immediately with the Canon of the Mass, while the choir, if there is one, sings the Sanctus. In the pre-1962 form, the choir pauses for the Consecration and continues with the &quot;Benedictus&quot; part afterwards. As a result of this division, the Sanctus has sometimes been spoken of as &quot;Sanctus and Benedictus&quot;. However, in line with Pope John XXIII&#x27;s revision of the rubrics of the liturgy, the splitting of the Sanctus, when sung to Gregorian chant (though not if sung polyphonically) was forbidden and is thus not allowed in celebrations of the 1962 Tridentine Mass as authorized by Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;.

In the Mass revised after the Second Vatican Council, the Sanctus may, of course, not be split, since the whole of the eucharistic prayer is sung or spoken aloud, and the only ceremony prescribed for the priest during the Sanctus is to join his hands. He and the people sing or recite together the whole of the Sanctus, before the priest continues the Eucharistic Prayer.

== Use in architecture and art ==
Words of the Sanctus are often used in church architecture and Christian art.

<doc id="1058281" wikidata="Q770563" url="?curid=1058281" title="Seine–Oise–Marne culture">
<text>The Seine–Oise–Marne or SOM culture is the name given by archaeologists to the final culture of the Neolithic and first culture of the Chalcolithic in northern France and southern Belgium.

It lasted from around 3100 to 2000 BCE and is most famous for its gallery grave megalithic tombs, which incorporate a port-hole slab separating the entrance from the main burial chamber. In the chalk valley of the River Marne, rock-cut tombs (hypogea) were dug to a similar design. Some have examples of megalithic art with images of axes, breasts, and necklaces carved on their walls.

Diagnostic artefacts include transverse arrowheads, antler sleeves and crude, flat-based cylindrical and bucket-shaped pottery decorated with appliqué cordons. The SOM culture had trade links with neighbouring cultures enabling the use of Callaïs and Grand Pressingy flint imported from Brittany and the Loire and later, the use of copper.

The culture seems to have had strong links with other areas and may have arisen from a composite of influences as indicated by the gallery grave design common across Europe and the pottery types which have comparators in Western France from 2600BC and also in Brittany, Switzerland and Denmark.

==Genetic profile==

Ten individuals dated between 3400 to 2900 BC were tested from two collective burial hipogea of the Mont-Aimé site (Val-des-Marais, Marne department); six out of seven males were assigned to the Y-chromosome haplogroup I2a1b1b1 (Y13335), and there was an individual belonging to haplogroup H2a1a. The autosomal components were a mix of European farmer and Western hunter-gatherer (this one ranging from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 55%). Two males buried in the Pierre Fritte dolmen (Yermenonville, Eure et Loire department) had the same mitochondrial haplogropup K and Y-DNA haplogroup I2a1.

<doc id="1058286" wikidata="Q6126272" url="?curid=1058286" title="USS Cutlass">
<text>USS &quot;Cutlass&quot; (SS-478), is a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine now in the service of the Republic of China Navy. She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the cutlassfish, a long, thin fish found widely along the coasts of the United States and in the West Indies. Her keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 10 July 1944. She was launched on 5 November 1944 sponsored by Mrs. R. E. Kintner, and commissioned on 17 March 1945 with Commander Herbert L. Jukes in command.

==Operational history==

===1945–1973 (U.S.)===
Departing Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 25 April 1945, &quot;Cutlass&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 15 July and put out on her maiden war patrol two days later. Assigned to patrol in the vicinity of the Kurile Islands, she entered the area one day after the announced Japanese surrender, remained on observation patrol until 24 August, then returned to Pearl Harbor. She sailed on 2 September for New York, arriving 24 September to receive visitors through Navy Day.

&quot;Cutlass&quot; cruised on the East Coast until 8 January 1946 when she cleared for the Panama Canal Zone. Except for three months of operations in Delaware Bay, &quot;Cutlass&quot; remained in the Caribbean Sea, based at Cristóbal, Canal Zone. From 23 August to 2 October 1947 she made a cruise down the coast of South America, around Cape Horn, visited Valparaíso, Chile, and returned to the east coast of South America through the Straits of Magellan.

&quot;Cutlass&quot; left the Panama Canal Zone 6 January 1948 for local operations at Key West, Florida, then entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in March for overhaul and modernization. Arriving at Key West 7 February 1949 she served as test submarine for Operation &quot;Rainbow&quot; evaluating color schemes to enhance livability, a serious problem in new submarines with long submergence capability. She continued to sail out of Key West until the summer of 1952 when her home port was changed to Norfolk, Virginia.

In 1953 &quot;Cutlass&quot; cruised to the Mediterranean Sea, visiting France, Greece, Turkey, North Africa, Gibraltar, Malta, and Spain, then sailed in Cuban waters to act as target for destroyers and aircraft engaged in antisubmarine exercises. She joined in local operations, fleet exercises and antisubmarine warfare training in the Caribbean Sea until September 1956 when she departed for the Mediterranean and operations with NATO forces including the Sixth Fleet. She visited Italy, Greece, Crete, Majorca, Portugal and England, returning to Norfolk in December. In 1958 she sailed on a north European cruise, visiting Rosyth, Scotland, Copenhagen and Korsor, Denmark, and passing through the Kiel Canal.

In the first half of 1959, &quot;Cutlass&quot; joined in the antisubmarine warfare development work of Task Force &quot;Alfa&quot; off the Virginia Capes, and in September sailed for the Mediterranean. In November she passed through the Suez Canal to join ships of the Pakistani Navy in exercises off Karachi, returning to Norfolk in December. After continued operations with TF &quot;Alfa,&quot; she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in February 1960 for an overhaul which continued until August. &quot;Cutlass&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 April 1973.

=== 1973–present (Taiwan) ===

On 4 December 1973, &quot;Cutlass&quot; had her torpedo tubes sealed and was sold to Taiwan, where she was commissioned in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS &quot;Hai Shih&quot; (SS-791), (meaning &quot;sea lion&quot;). They then tried to restore her torpedo capabilities. In January 2017, Taiwan announced that she would receive a retrofit to extend her service life until 2026, making her the longest-serving submarine in history. The submarine is still operational and reportedly capable of combat. The $19 million retrofit was to improve the hull and the diesel vessel&#x27;s navigational elements.

<text>Casomorphin is an opioid peptide (protein fragment) derived from the digestion of the milk protein casein.

==Health==
Digestive enzymes can break casein down into peptides that have some biological activity in cells and in laboratory animals though conclusive causal effects on humans have not been established.

Although research has shown high rates of use of complementary and alternative therapies for children with autism, including gluten and/or casein exclusion diets, there was a lack of evidence that these diets had any effect.

If opioid peptides breach the intestinal barrier, typically linked to permeability and constrained biosynthesis of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), they can attach to opioid receptors.
Elucidation requires a systemic framework that acknowledges that public-health effects of food-derived opioids are complex with varying genetic susceptibility and confounding factors, together with system-wide interactions and feedbacks.

<doc id="1058296" wikidata="Q7873388" url="?curid=1058296" title="USS Remora">
<text>USS &quot;Remora&quot; (SS-487), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the remora, a fish with a suctorial disk on its head enabling it to cling to other fish and to ships.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Remora&quot;′s keel was laid down on 5 March 1945 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 12 July 1945, sponsored by Mrs. T. W. Samuels III, and commissioned on 3 January 1946 with Commander Robert Sellars in command.

==Service history==
===Training submarine===
Completing her Caribbean Sea shakedown in April 1946, &quot;Remora&quot; operated out of New London, Connecticut, as a training submarine until January 1947. Then transferred to the Pacific, she transited the Panama Canal at mid-month and arrived at Mare Island, Vallejo, California, on 14 February to begin a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY-II) conversion. Early in November, she completed trials and on 22 February arrived at San Diego, California, her new homeport.

===Eastern Pacific===
For the next two years, she remained in the eastern Pacific operating primarily off California, but during the summer and early fall of 1948, ranged as far north as the Aleutian Islands. On 1 May 1950 she headed west for her first deployment in the Far East. On 8 June she arrived at Sasebo, and on 11 June she shifted to Yokosuka, from which base she conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training exercises with units of Naval Forces Far East. Two weeks later the Korean War began.

A unit of TF 96, Naval Forces Japan &quot;Remora&quot; patrolled Soya Strait, between Hokkaidō and Sakhalin in late July and early August. Later in the month, she headed back to San Diego. During the next two years she underwent overhaul, provided services for the Line School at Monterey, California, and conducted local training exercises. She returned to the western Pacific in early 1953. Arriving at Buckner Bay on 15 March, she continued on to Japan in April and at mid-month rejoined TF 96. In June she was back in Okinawan waters for patrols and exercises, after which she returned to Yokosuka. On 2 July she headed east, reaching San Diego on 3 August.

After the fighting in Korea ended, &quot;Remora&quot; remained based at San Diego and through the decade continued to alternate training exercises and patrols in the western Pacific with similar First Fleet operations off the United States West Coast and in Hawaiian waters. She remained in the eastern Pacific during 1956 and 1958, but, during the spring of the latter year, was engaged in extended exercises off Alaska.

===Pearl Harbor===
In November 1961, &quot;Remora&quot; was transferred from San Diego to Pearl Harbor. The following year she underwent a seven-month Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY-III) conversion which lengthened her hull by and her conning tower by five feet. Then, in 1963, she was employed to evaluate antisubmarine sonar in Hawaiian waters. In May 1964, she resumed a schedule of annual six-month WestPac deployments which she continued into 1969. &quot;Remora&quot; was one of the last diesel boats to receive the Navy Unit Commendation for &quot;Meritorious Service for operations during the Summer and Fall of 1967.&quot; During a shipyard overhaul in late 1967 early 1968, Engine #1 was removed and replaced with a &quot;Prairie Masker&quot; system designed to mask her engines during snorkeling.

In July 1969, &quot;Remora&quot; shifted home ports, from Pearl Harbor to Charleston, South Carolina. With the exception of one Mediterranean Sea cruise, from 16 February to 26 June 1970, she continued to operate out of Charleston, along the Atlantic seaboard, in the Caribbean Sea, and in the Gulf of Mexico, until decommissioned 29 October 1973 at Charleston.

===Greek service===

After decommissioning from US Navy in 1973, she was transferred to the Hellenic Navy as a sale, and recommissioned &quot;Katsonis&quot; (S-115). She served until 31 March 1993, when she was decommissioned.

<doc id="1058299" wikidata="Q1756248" url="?curid=1058299" title="Particle image velocimetry">
<text>Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is an optical method of flow visualization used in education and research. It is used to obtain instantaneous velocity measurements and related properties in fluids. The fluid is seeded with tracer particles which, for sufficiently small particles, are assumed to faithfully follow the flow dynamics (the degree to which the particles faithfully follow the flow is represented by the Stokes number). The fluid with entrained particles is illuminated so that particles are visible. The motion of the seeding particles is used to calculate speed and direction (the velocity field) of the flow being studied.

Other techniques used to measure flows are laser Doppler velocimetry and hot-wire anemometry. The main difference between PIV and those techniques is that PIV produces two-dimensional or even three-dimensional vector fields, while the other techniques measure the velocity at a point. During PIV, the particle concentration is such that it is possible to identify individual particles in an image, but not with certainty to track it between images. When the particle concentration is so low that it is possible to follow an individual particle it is called particle tracking velocimetry, while laser speckle velocimetry is used for cases where the particle concentration is so high that it is difficult to observe individual particles in an image.

Typical PIV apparatus consists of a camera (normally a digital camera with a charge-coupled device (CCD) chip in modern systems), a strobe or laser with an optical arrangement to limit the physical region illuminated (normally a cylindrical lens to convert a light beam to a line), a synchronizer to act as an external trigger for control of the camera and laser, the seeding particles and the fluid under investigation. A fiber-optic cable or liquid light guide may connect the laser to the lens setup. PIV software is used to post-process the optical images.

==History==
Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a non-intrusive optical flow measurement technique used to study fluid flow patterns and velocities. PIV has found widespread applications in various fields of science and engineering, including aerodynamics, combustion, oceanography, and biofluids. The development of PIV can be traced back to the early 20th century when researchers started exploring different methods to visualize and measure fluid flow.

The early days of PIV can be credited to the pioneering work of Ludwig Prandtl, a German physicist and engineer, who is often regarded as the father of modern aerodynamics. In the 1920s, Prandtl and his colleagues used shadowgraph and schlieren techniques to visualize and measure flow patterns in wind tunnels. These methods relied on the refractive index differences between the fluid regions of interest and the surrounding medium to generate contrast in the images. However, these methods were limited to qualitative observations and did not provide quantitative velocity measurements.

The early PIV setups were relatively simple and used photographic film as the image recording medium. A laser was used to illuminate particles, such as oil droplets or smoke, added to the flow, and the resulting particle motion was captured on film. The films were then developed and analyzed to obtain flow velocity information. These early PIV systems had limited spatial resolution and were labor-intensive, but they provided valuable insights into fluid flow behavior.

The advent of lasers in the 1960s revolutionized the field of flow visualization and measurement. Lasers provided a coherent and monochromatic light source that could be easily focused and directed, making them ideal for optical flow diagnostics. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, researchers such as Arthur L. Lavoie, Hervé L. J. H. Scohier, and Adrian Fouriaux independently proposed the concept of particle image velocimetry (PIV). PIV was initially used for studying air flows and measuring wind velocities, but its applications soon extended to other areas of fluid dynamics.

In the 1980s, the development of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and digital image processing techniques revolutionized PIV. CCD cameras replaced photographic film as the image recording medium, providing higher spatial resolution, faster data acquisition, and real-time processing capabilities. Digital image processing techniques allowed for accurate and automated analysis of the PIV images, greatly reducing the time and effort required for data analysis.

The advent of digital imaging and computer processing capabilities in the 1980s and 1990s revolutionized PIV, leading to the development of advanced PIV techniques, such as multi-frame PIV, stereo-PIV, and time-resolved PIV. These techniques allowed for higher accuracy, higher spatial and temporal resolution, and three-dimensional measurements, expanding the capabilities of PIV and enabling its application in more complex flow systems.

In the following decades, PIV continued to evolve and advance in several key areas. One significant advancement was the use of dual or multiple exposures in PIV, which allowed for the measurement of both instantaneous and time-averaged velocity fields. Dual-exposure PIV (often referred to as &quot;stereo PIV&quot; or &quot;stereo-PIV&quot;) uses two cameras to capture two consecutive images with a known time delay, allowing for the measurement of three-component velocity vectors in a plane. This provided a more complete picture of the flow field and enabled the study of complex flows, such as turbulence and vortices.

In the 2000s and beyond, PIV continued to evolve with the development of high-power lasers, high-speed cameras, and advanced image analysis algorithms. These advancements have enabled PIV to be used in extreme conditions, such as high-speed flows, combustion systems, and microscale flows, opening up new frontiers for PIV research. PIV has also been integrated with other measurement techniques, such as temperature and concentration measurements, and has been used in emerging fields, such as microscale and nanoscale flows, granular flows, and additive manufacturing.

The advancement of PIV has been driven by the development of new laser sources, cameras, and image analysis techniques. Advances in laser technology have led to the use of high-power lasers, such as s and diode lasers, which provide increased illumination intensity and allow for measurements in more challenging environments, such as high-speed flows and combustion systems. High-speed cameras with improved sensitivity and frame rates have also been developed, enabling the capture of transient flow phenomena with high temporal resolution. Furthermore, advanced image analysis techniques, such as correlation-based algorithms, phase-based methods, and machine learning algorithms, have been developed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of PIV measurements.

Another major advancement in PIV was the development of digital correlation algorithms for image analysis. These algorithms allowed for more accurate and efficient processing of PIV images, enabling higher spatial resolution and faster data acquisition rates. Various correlation algorithms, such as cross-correlation, Fourier-transform-based correlation, and adaptive correlation, were developed and widely used in PIV research.

PIV has also benefited from the development of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which have become powerful tools for predicting and analyzing fluid flow behavior. PIV data can be used to validate and calibrate CFD simulations, and in turn, CFD simulations can provide insights into the interpretation and analysis of PIV data. The combination of experimental PIV measurements and numerical simulations has enabled researchers to gain a deeper understanding of fluid flow phenomena and has led to new discoveries and advancements in various scientific and engineering fields.

In addition to the technical advancements, PIV has also been integrated with other measurement techniques, such as temperature and concentration measurements, to provide more comprehensive and multi-parameter flow measurements. For example, combining PIV with thermographic phosphors or laser-induced fluorescence allows for simultaneous measurement of velocity and temperature or concentration fields, providing valuable data for studying heat transfer, mixing, and chemical reactions in fluid flows.

===Applications===
The historical development of PIV has been driven by the need for accurate and non-intrusive flow measurements in various fields of science and engineering. The early years of PIV were marked by the development of basic PIV techniques, such as two-frame PIV, and the application of PIV in fundamental fluid dynamics research, primarily in academic settings. As PIV gained popularity, researchers started using it in more practical applications, such as aerodynamics, combustion, and oceanography.

As PIV continues to advance and evolve, it is expected to find further applications in a wide range of fields, from fundamental research in fluid dynamics to practical applications in engineering, environmental science, and medicine. The continued development of PIV techniques, including advancements in lasers, cameras, image analysis algorithms, and integration with other measurement techniques, will further enhance its capabilities and broaden its applications.

In aerodynamics, PIV has been used to study the flow over aircraft wings, rotor blades, and other aerodynamic surfaces, providing insights into the flow behavior and aerodynamic performance of these systems.

As PIV gained popularity, it found applications in a wide range of fields beyond aerodynamics, including combustion, oceanography, biofluids, and microscale flows. In combustion research, PIV has been used to study the details of combustion processes, such as flame propagation, ignition, and fuel spray dynamics, providing valuable insights into the complex interactions between fuel and air in combustion systems. In oceanography, PIV has been used to study the motion of water currents, waves, and turbulence, aiding in the understanding of ocean circulation patterns and coastal erosion. In biofluids research, PIV has been applied to study blood flow in arteries and veins, respiratory flow, and the motion of cilia and flagella in microorganisms, providing important information for understanding physiological processes and disease mechanisms.

PIV has also been used in new and emerging fields, such as microscale and nanoscale flows, granular flows, and multiphase flows. Micro-PIV and nano-PIV have been used to study flows in microchannels, nanopores, and biological systems at the microscale and nanoscale, providing insights into the unique behaviors of fluids at these length scales. PIV has been applied to study the motion of particles in granular flows, such as avalanches and landslides, and to investigate multiphase flows, such as bubbly flows and oil-water flows, which are important in environmental and industrial processes. In microscale flows, conventional measurement techniques are challenging to apply due to the small length scales involved. Micro-PIV has been used to study flows in microfluidic devices, such as lab-on-a-chip systems, and to investigate phenomena such as droplet formation, mixing, and cell motion, with applications in drug delivery, biomedical diagnostics, and microscale engineering.

PIV has also found applications in advanced manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing, where understanding and optimizing fluid flow behavior is critical for achieving high-quality and high-precision products. PIV has been used to study the flow dynamics of gases, liquids, and powders in additive manufacturing processes, providing insights into the process parameters that affect the quality and properties of the manufactured products.

PIV has also been used in environmental science to study the dispersion of pollutants in air and water, sediment transport in rivers and coastal areas, and the behavior of pollutants in natural and engineered systems. In energy research, PIV has been used to study the flow behavior in wind turbines, hydroelectric power plants, and combustion processes in engines and turbines, aiding in the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly energy systems.

==Equipment and apparatus==

===Seeding particles===

The seeding particles are an inherently critical component of the PIV system. Depending on the fluid under investigation, the particles must be able to match the fluid properties reasonably well. Otherwise they will not follow the flow satisfactorily enough for the PIV analysis to be considered accurate. Ideal particles will have the same density as the fluid system being used, and are spherical (these particles are called microspheres). While the actual particle choice is dependent on the nature of the fluid, generally for macro PIV investigations they are glass beads, polystyrene, polyethylene, aluminum flakes or oil droplets (if the fluid under investigation is a gas). Refractive index for the seeding particles should be different from the fluid which they are seeding, so that the laser sheet incident on the fluid flow will reflect off of the particles and be scattered towards the camera.

The particles are typically of a diameter in the order of 10 to 100 micrometers. As for sizing, the particles should be small enough so that response time of the particles to the motion of the fluid is reasonably short to accurately follow the flow, yet large enough to scatter a significant quantity of the incident laser light. For some experiments involving combustion, seeding particle size may be smaller, in the order of 1 micrometer, to avoid the quenching effect that the inert particles may have on flames. Due to the small size of the particles, the particles&#x27; motion is dominated by Stokes&#x27; drag and settling or rising effects. In a model where particles are modeled as spherical (microspheres) at a very low Reynolds number, the ability of the particles to follow the fluid&#x27;s flow is inversely proportional to the difference in density between the particles and the fluid, and also inversely proportional to the square of their diameter. The scattered light from the particles is dominated by Mie scattering and so is also proportional to the square of the particles&#x27; diameters. Thus the particle size needs to be balanced to scatter enough light to accurately visualize all particles within the laser sheet plane, but small enough to accurately follow the flow.

The seeding mechanism needs to also be designed so as to seed the flow to a sufficient degree without overly disturbing the flow.

===Camera===
To perform PIV analysis on the flow, two exposures of laser light are required upon the camera from the flow. Originally, with the inability of cameras to capture multiple frames at high speeds, both exposures were captured on the same frame and this single frame was used to determine the flow. A process called autocorrelation was used for this analysis. However, as a result of autocorrelation the direction of the flow becomes unclear, as it is not clear which particle spots are from the first pulse and which are from the second pulse. Faster digital cameras using CCD or CMOS chips were developed since then that can capture two frames at high speed with a few hundred ns difference between the frames. This has allowed each exposure to be isolated on its own frame for more accurate cross-correlation analysis. The limitation of typical cameras is that this fast speed is limited to a pair of shots. This is because each pair of shots must be transferred to the computer before another pair of shots can be taken. Typical cameras can only take a pair of shots at a much slower speed. High speed CCD or CMOS cameras are available but are much more expensive.

===Laser and optics===
For macro PIV setups, lasers are predominant due to their ability to produce high-power light beams with short pulse durations. This yields short exposure times for each frame. s, commonly used in PIV setups, emit primarily at 1064 nm wavelength and its harmonics (532, 266, etc.) For safety reasons, the laser emission is typically bandpass filtered to isolate the 532 nm harmonics (this is green light, the only harmonic able to be seen by the naked eye). A fiber-optic cable or liquid light guide might be used to direct the laser light to the experimental setup.

The optics consist of a spherical lens and cylindrical lens combination. The cylindrical lens expands the laser into a plane while the spherical lens compresses the plane into a thin sheet. This is critical as the PIV technique cannot generally measure motion normal to the laser sheet and so ideally this is eliminated by maintaining an entirely 2-dimensional laser sheet. The spherical lens cannot compress the laser sheet into an actual 2-dimensional plane. The minimum thickness is on the order of the wavelength of the laser light and occurs at a finite distance from the optics setup (the focal point of the spherical lens). This is the ideal location to place the analysis area of the experiment.

The correct lens for the camera should also be selected to properly focus on and visualize the particles within the investigation area.

===Synchronizer===
The synchronizer acts as an external trigger for both the camera(s) and the laser. While analogue systems in the form of a photosensor, rotating aperture and a light source have been used in the past, most systems in use today are digital. Controlled by a computer, the synchronizer can dictate the timing of each frame of the CCD camera&#x27;s sequence in conjunction with the firing of the laser to within 1 ns precision. Thus the time between each pulse of the laser and the placement of the laser shot in reference to the camera&#x27;s timing can be accurately controlled. Knowledge of this timing is critical as it is needed to determine the velocity of the fluid in the PIV analysis. Stand-alone electronic synchronizers, called digital delay generators, offer variable resolution timing from as low as 250 ps to as high as several ms. With up to eight channels of synchronized timing, they offer the means to control several flash lamps and Q-switches as well as provide for multiple camera exposures.

==Analysis==

The frames are split into a large number of interrogation areas, or windows. It is then possible to calculate a displacement vector for each window with help of signal processing and autocorrelation or cross-correlation techniques. This is converted to a velocity using the time between laser shots and the physical size of each pixel on the camera. The size of the interrogation window should be chosen to have at least 6 particles per window on average. A visual example of PIV analysis can be seen here.

The synchronizer controls the timing between image exposures and also permits image pairs to be acquired at various times along the flow. For accurate PIV analysis, it is ideal that the region of the flow that is of interest should display an average particle displacement of about 8 pixels. This is a compromise between a longer time spacing which would allow the particles to travel further between frames, making it harder to identify which interrogation window traveled to which point, and a shorter time spacing, which could make it overly difficult to identify any displacement within the flow.

The scattered light from each particle should be in the region of 2 to 4 pixels across on the image. If too large an area is recorded, particle image size drops and peak locking might occur with loss of sub pixel precision. There are methods to overcome the peak locking effect, but they require some additional work.
If there is in house PIV expertise and time to develop a system, even though it is not trivial, it is possible to build a custom PIV system. Research grade PIV systems do, however, have high power lasers and high end camera specifications for being able to take measurements with the broadest spectrum of experiments required in research.

An example of PIV analysis without installation: 

PIV is closely related to digital image correlation, an optical displacement measurement technique that uses correlation techniques to study the deformation of solid materials.

==Pros and cons==

===Advantages===
The method is, to a large degree, nonintrusive. The added tracers (if they are properly chosen) generally cause negligible distortion of the fluid flow.

Optical measurement avoids the need for Pitot tubes, hotwire anemometers or other intrusive Flow measurement probes. The method is capable of measuring an entire two-dimensional cross section (geometry) of the flow field simultaneously.

High speed data processing allows the generation of large numbers of image pairs which, on a personal computer may be analysed in real time or at a later time, and a high quantity of near-continuous information may be gained.

Sub pixel displacement values allow a high degree of accuracy, since each vector is the statistical average for many particles within a particular tile. Displacement can typically be accurate down to 10% of one pixel on the image plane.

===Drawbacks===
In some cases the particles will, due to their higher density, not perfectly follow the motion of the fluid (gas/liquid). If experiments are done in water, for instance, it is easily possible to find very cheap particles (e.g. plastic powder with a diameter of ~60 μm) with the same density as water. If the density still does not fit, the density of the fluid can be tuned by increasing/ decreasing its temperature. This leads to slight changes in the Reynolds number, so the fluid velocity or the size of the experimental object has to be changed to account for this.

Particle image velocimetry methods will in general not be able to measure components along the z-axis (towards to/away from the camera). These components might not only be missed, they might also introduce an interference in the data for the x/y-components caused by parallax. These problems do not exist in Stereoscopic PIV, which uses two cameras to measure all three velocity components.

Since the resulting velocity vectors are based on cross-correlating the intensity distributions over small areas of the flow, the resulting velocity field is a spatially averaged representation of the actual velocity field. This obviously has consequences for the accuracy of spatial derivatives of the velocity field, vorticity, and spatial correlation functions that are often derived from PIV velocity fields.

PIV systems used in research often use class IV lasers and high-resolution, high-speed cameras, which bring cost and safety constraints.

==More complex PIV setups==

===Stereoscopic PIV===
Stereoscopic PIV utilises two cameras with separate viewing angles to extract the z-axis displacement. Both cameras must be focused on the same spot in the flow and must be properly calibrated to have the same point in focus.

In fundamental fluid mechanics, displacement within a unit time in the X, Y and Z directions are commonly defined by the variables U, V and W. As was previously described, basic PIV extracts the U and V displacements as functions of the in-plane X and Y directions. This enables calculations of the formula_1, formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 velocity gradients. However, the other 5 terms of the velocity gradient tensor are unable to be found from this information. The stereoscopic PIV analysis also grants the Z-axis displacement component, W, within that plane. Not only does this grant the Z-axis velocity of the fluid at the plane of interest, but two more velocity gradient terms can be determined: formula_5 and formula_6. The velocity gradient components formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 can not be determined.
The velocity gradient components form the tensor:

:formula_10

===Dual plane stereoscopic PIV===
This is an expansion of stereoscopic PIV by adding a second plane of investigation directly offset from the first one. Four cameras are required for this analysis. The two planes of laser light are created by splitting the laser emission with a beam splitter into two beams. Each beam is then polarized orthogonally with respect to one another. Next, they are transmitted through a set of optics and used to illuminate one of the two planes simultaneously.

The four cameras are paired into groups of two. Each pair focuses on one of the laser sheets in the same manner as single-plane stereoscopic PIV. Each of the four cameras has a polarizing filter designed to only let pass the polarized scattered light from the respective planes of interest. This essentially creates a system by which two separate stereoscopic PIV analysis setups are run simultaneously with only a minimal separation distance between the planes of interest.

This technique allows the determination of the three velocity gradient components single-plane stereoscopic PIV could not calculate: formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9. With this technique, the entire velocity gradient tensor of the fluid at the 2-dimensional plane of interest can be quantified. A difficulty arises in that the laser sheets should be maintained close enough together so as to approximate a two-dimensional plane, yet offset enough that meaningful velocity gradients can be found in the z-direction.

===Multi-plane stereoscopic PIV===

There are several extensions of the dual-plane stereoscopic PIV idea available. There is an option to create several parallel laser sheets using a set of beamsplitters and quarter-wave plates, providing three or more planes, using a single laser unit and stereoscopic PIV setup, called XPIV.

===Micro PIV===
With the use of an epifluorescent microscope, microscopic flows can be analyzed. MicroPIV makes use of fluorescing particles that excite at a specific wavelength and emit at another wavelength. Laser light is reflected through a dichroic mirror, travels through an objective lens that focuses on the point of interest, and illuminates a regional volume. The emission from the particles, along with reflected laser light, shines back through the objective, the dichroic mirror and through an emission filter that blocks the laser light. Where PIV draws its 2-dimensional analysis properties from the planar nature of the laser sheet, microPIV utilizes the ability of the objective lens to focus on only one plane at a time, thus creating a 2-dimensional plane of viewable particles.

MicroPIV particles are on the order of several hundred nm in diameter, meaning they are extremely susceptible to Brownian motion. Thus, a special ensemble averaging analysis technique must be utilized for this technique. The cross-correlation of a series of basic PIV analyses are averaged together to determine the actual velocity field. Thus, only steady flows can be investigated. Special preprocessing techniques must also be utilized since the images tend to have a zero-displacement bias from background noise and low signal-noise ratios. Usually, high numerical aperture objectives are also used to capture the maximum emission light possible. Optic choice is also critical for the same reasons.

===Holographic PIV===
Holographic PIV (HPIV) encompasses a variety of experimental techniques which use the interference of coherent light scattered by a particle and a reference beam to encode information of the amplitude and phase of the scattered light incident on a sensor plane. This encoded information, known as a hologram, can then be used to reconstruct the original intensity field by illuminating the hologram with the original reference beam via optical methods or digital approximations. The intensity field is interrogated using 3-D cross-correlation techniques to yield a velocity field.

Off-axis HPIV uses separate beams to provide the object and reference waves. This setup is used to avoid speckle noise form being generated from interference of the two waves within the scattering medium, which would occur if they were both propagated through the medium. An off-axis experiment is a highly complex optical system comprising numerous optical elements, and the reader is referred to an example schematic in Sheng et al. for a more complete presentation.

In-line holography is another approach that provides some unique advantages for particle imaging. Perhaps the largest of these is the use of forward scattered light, which is orders of magnitude brighter than scattering oriented normal to the beam direction. Additionally, the optical setup of such systems is much simpler because the residual light does not need to be separated and recombined at a different location. The in-line configuration also provides a relatively easy extension to apply CCD sensors, creating a separate class of experiments known as digital in-line holography. The complexity of such setups shifts from the optical setup to image post-processing, which involves the use of simulated reference beams. Further discussion of these topics is beyond the scope of this article and is treated in Arroyo and Hinsch

A variety of issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues involves the reconstruction itself. In holography, the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to Mie scattering theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue is the presence of substantial speckle noise which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the reference beam is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the scattering medium, such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because holography requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the speckle noise in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional image-based correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.

In light of these issues, it may seem that HPIV is too complicated and error-prone to be used for flow measurements. However, many impressive results have been obtained with all holographic approaches. Svizher and Cohen used a hybrid HPIV system to study the physics of hairpin vortices. Tao et al. investigated the alignment of vorticity and strain rate tensors in high Reynolds number turbulence. As a final example, Sheng et al. used holographic microscopy to perform near-wall measurements of turbulent shear stress and velocity in turbulent boundary layers.

===Scanning PIV===
By using a rotating mirror, a high-speed camera and correcting for geometric changes, PIV can be performed nearly instantly on a set of planes throughout the flow field. Fluid properties between the planes can then be interpolated. Thus, a quasi-volumetric analysis can be performed on a target volume. Scanning PIV can be performed in conjunction with the other 2-dimensional PIV methods described to approximate a 3-dimensional volumetric analysis.

===Tomographic PIV===
Tomographic PIV is based on the illumination, recording, and reconstruction of tracer particles within a 3-D measurement volume. The technique uses several cameras to record simultaneous views of the illuminated volume, which is then reconstructed to yield a discretized 3-D intensity field. A pair of intensity fields are analyzed using 3-D cross-correlation algorithms to calculate the 3-D, 3-C velocity field within the volume. The technique was originally developed
by Elsinga et al. in 2006.

The reconstruction procedure is a complex under-determined inverse problem. The primary complication is that a single set of views can result from a large number of 3-D volumes. Procedures to properly determine the unique volume from a set of views are the foundation for the field of tomography. In most Tomo-PIV experiments, the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART) is used. The advantage of this pixel-by-pixel reconstruction technique is that it avoids the need to identify individual particles. Reconstructing the discretized 3-D intensity field is computationally intensive and, beyond MART, several developments have sought to significantly reduce this computational expense, for example the multiple line-of-sight simultaneous multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MLOS-SMART)
which takes advantage of the sparsity of the 3-D intensity field to reduce memory storage and calculation requirements.

As a rule of thumb, at least four cameras are needed for acceptable reconstruction accuracy, and best results are obtained when the cameras are placed at approximately 30 degrees normal to the measurement volume. Many additional factors are necessary to consider for a successful experiment.

Tomo-PIV has been applied to a broad range of flows. Examples include the structure of a turbulent boundary layer/shock wave interaction, the vorticity of a cylinder wake or pitching airfoil,
rod-airfoil aeroacoustic experiments, and to measure small-scale, micro flows. More recently, Tomo-PIV has been used together with 3-D particle tracking velocimetry to understand predator-prey interactions, and portable version of Tomo-PIV has been used to study unique swimming organisms in Antarctica.

===Thermographic PIV===
Thermographic PIV is based on the use of thermographic phosphors as seeding particles. The use of these thermographic phosphors permits simultaneous measurement of velocity and temperature in a flow.

Thermographic phosphors consist of ceramic host materials doped with rare-earth or transition metal ions, which exhibit phosphorescence when they are illuminated with UV-light. The decay time and the spectra of this phosphorescence are temperature sensitive and offer two different methods to measure temperature. The decay time method consists on the fitting of the phosphorescence decay to an exponential function and is normally used in point measurements, although it has been demonstrated in surface measurements. The intensity ratio between two different spectral lines of the phosphorescence emission, tracked using spectral filters, is also temperature-dependent and can be employed for surface measurements.

The micrometre-sized phosphor particles used in thermographic PIV are seeded into the flow as a tracer and, after illumination with a thin laser light sheet, the temperature of the particles can be measured from the phosphorescence, normally using an intensity ratio technique. It is important that the particles are of small size so that not only they follow the flow satisfactorily but also they rapidly assume its temperature. For a diameter of 2 μm, the thermal slip between particle and gas is as small as the velocity slip.

Illumination of the phosphor is achieved using UV light. Most thermographic phosphors absorb light in a broad band in the UV and therefore can be excited using a YAG:Nd laser. Theoretically, the same light can be used both for PIV and temperature measurements, but this would mean that UV-sensitive cameras are needed. In practice, two different beams originated in separate lasers are overlapped. While one of the beams is used for velocity measurements, the other is used to measure the temperature.

The use of thermographic phosphors offers some advantageous features including ability to survive in reactive and high temperature environments, chemical stability and insensitivity of their phosphorescence emission to pressure and gas composition. In addition, thermographic phosphors emit light at different wavelengths, allowing spectral discrimination against excitation light and background.

Thermographic PIV has been demonstrated for time averaged

and single shot

measurements. Recently, also time-resolved high speed (3 kHz) measurements

have been successfully performed.

=== Artificial Intelligence PIV ===
With the development of artificial intelligence, there have been scientific publications and commercial software proposing PIV calculations based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks. The methodology used stems mainly from optical flow neural networks popular in machine vision. A data set that includes particle images is generated to train the parameters of the networks. The result is a deep neural network for PIV which can provide estimation of dense motion, down to a maximum of one vector for one pixel if the recorded images allow. AI PIV promises a dense velocity field, not limited by the size of the interrogation window, which limits traditional PIV to one vector per 16 x 16 pixels.

===Real time processing and applications of PIV===
With the advance of digital technologies, real time processing and applications of PIV became possible. For instance, GPUs can be used to speed up substantially the direct of Fourier transform based correlations of single interrogation windows. Similarly multi-processing, parallel or multi-threading processes on several CPUs or multi-core CPUs are beneficial for the distributed processing of multiple interrogation windows or multiple images. Some of the applications use real time image processing methods, such as FPGA based on-the-fly image compression or image processing. More recently, the PIV real time measurement and processing capabilities are implemented for the future use in active flow control with the flow based feedback.

==Applications==
PIV has been applied to a wide range of flow problems, varying from the flow over an aircraft wing in a wind tunnel to vortex formation in prosthetic heart valves. 3-dimensional techniques have been sought to analyze turbulent flow and jets.

Rudimentary PIV algorithms based on cross-correlation can be implemented in a matter of hours, while more sophisticated algorithms may require a significant investment of time. Several open source implementations are available. Application of PIV in the US education system has been limited due to high price and safety concerns of industrial research grade PIV systems.

=== Granular PIV: velocity measurement in granular flows and avalanches ===
PIV can also be used to measure the velocity field of the free surface and basal boundary in a granular flows such as those in shaken containers, tumblers and avalanches.
This analysis is particularly well-suited for nontransparent media such as sand, gravel, quartz, or other granular materials that are common in geophysics. This PIV approach is called &quot;granular PIV&quot;. The set-up for granular PIV differs from the usual PIV setup in that the optical surface structure which is produced by illumination of the surface of the granular flow is already sufficient to detect the motion. This means one does not need to add tracer particles in the bulk material.

<text>USS &quot;Sirago&quot; (SS-485), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was named for the sirago, a small, freshwater tropical fish.

==Construction and launch==

Her keel was laid down on 4 January 1945 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 13 May 1945, sponsored by Mrs. L. Mendel Rivers and commissioned on 13 August 1945 with Commander F. J. Harlfinger II, in command.

==First duties==

Commissioned at the end of World War II, &quot;Sirago&quot; conducted her shakedown cruise off the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea during the fall of 1945. After shakedown, she joined Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 8 at New London, Connecticut, and, in January 1946, she proceeded to Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she participated in the destruction of U-Boats U-1228, and U-805 off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts on 5 February and 8, later sinking U-858 as well on 21 November 1947. On returning to New London, &quot;Sirago&quot; commenced duties that included training services for the Submarine School and for the fleet&#x27;s destroyer force; experimental exercises to evaluate new techniques and equipment; type training; and fleet exercises that took her from Davis Strait into the Caribbean. In December 1948, she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) conversion; and, on 25 July 1949, she left the yard for Norfolk, Virginia, where, as a modernized high-speed attack submarine, she joined SubRon 6.

Attached to SubRon 6 for the next twenty-two years, &quot;Sirago&quot;’s primary mission was antisubmarine warfare. Secondary missions included antishipping warfare, intelligence gathering, and the provision of services for research and development studies. Those duties, during the 1950s, continued to see her operating primarily in the western Atlantic as she participated in exercises with others of her ASW group; in fleet exercises; in joint Canadian-United States exercises, and in NATO exercises, which took her into the eastern Atlantic Ocean and North Sea areas. During the 1950s, she also deployed to the Mediterranean Sea where she operated as a unit of the Sixth Fleet from September to November 1951 and from September to December 1954.

===Fatal accident===
An explosion aboard &quot;Sirago&quot; while drydocked at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 2 June 1954, killed two men and injured four others. The blast, which occurred during plastic spraying of a main ballast tank, killed two civilian painters and injured a sailor and three other civilian painters. The burst was heard three miles away.

==Overhaul and new service==

In October 1962, &quot;Sirago&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for another extensive overhaul which included the installation of a fiberglass superstructure and sail and, in the spring of 1963, she resumed operations with her ASW group, Task Group &quot;ALFA.&quot; That fall, she deployed to the Middle East for CENTO exercise &quot;MIDLINK VI&quot;; but, during the remainder of the 1960s and into the 1970s, her operations were similar to those of the 1950s.

On 1 July 1971, with Commander Clyde H. Shaffer Jr. in command, &quot;Sirago&quot; was reassigned to SubRon 12 at Key West, Florida; but, less than four months later, on 15 October, she was ordered back to Norfolk, where she rejoined SubRon 6 for one more year.

==Decommissioning==

&quot;Sirago&quot; remained in SubRon 6 until she was decommissioned on 1 June 1972. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the same day, she was turned over to the Naval Ships Systems Command and sold for scrapping to the Jacobson Metal Company of Chesapeake, Virginia, on 2 May 1973.

<text>USS &quot;Odax&quot; (SS-484), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for odax, a brilliantly colored, red and green fish belonging to the family &quot;Scaridae&quot;, the parrot fishes.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Odax&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 4 December 1944. She was launched on 10 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Luise Fogarty, wife of Rhode Island Congressman John E. Fogarty, and commissioned on 11 July 1945.

==1940s==

After shakedown off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, &quot;Odax&quot; got underway 19 September 1945 for Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba to provide services to the Fleet Training Group. On 30 October 1945, she departed for Key West, Florida, for duty with the Fleet Sonar School and conducted operational training until September 1946.

In September 1946, as part of the Bureau of Ships post-war investigation of the high-speed submarine, &quot;Odax&quot; was selected for conversion to a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) submarine and returned to the Portsmouth Navy Yard. Completing conversion in August 1947, the first of the GUPPY submarines, she departed for Key West for extensive research development work.

==1950s==

In August 1951, &quot;Odax&quot; again arrived at the Portsmouth Navy Yard for conversion. The major aspect was the addition of a snorkel and redesignation as a GUPPY II submarine. She first put her snorkel to tactical use in a large-scale convoy exercise in the spring of 1952.

From 1952 through 1955, &quot;Odax&quot; provided services to the Operational Development Force and Fleet Sonar School in Key West and to the Fleet Training Group in Guantanamo Bay. During 1956 she received new equipment of improved design at the Charleston Naval Shipyard and departed in December, bound for the North Atlantic, to operate with the British Fleet. Subsequent operations in 1957 included services to the Operational Development Force, training submariners in the latest tactics of undersea warfare.

In September 1958, &quot;Odax&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for a tour with the Sixth Fleet. During this deployment she transited the Suez Canal to participate in a Baghdad Pact exercise in the Arabian Sea.

After her return home, &quot;Odax&quot; changed home port transferring to Charleston, South Carolina, in February 1959. She sailed from here early in 1960 to return to the North Atlantic for Barrier Patrol.

==1960s==

&quot;Odax&quot; departed Charleston, South Carolina in August 1960 for South America to conduct exercises with naval units of various South American countries during Exercise UNITAS. In December, she returned to Charleston to resume local operations.

Between 1961 and 1964, &quot;Odax&quot; conducted training operations out of Charleston with interim periods for overhaul and modernization.

In August 1964, she deployed again to South America to participate in combined operations while circumnavigating the continent, returning in December. From 1965 to 1967 she operated out of Charleston.

In May 1967, &quot;Odax&quot; began a deployment in Northern Europe. Upon her return to Charleston she was awarded the coveted Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for Fiscal Year 1967. She resumed coastal operations in October 1967.

In October and November 1967, &quot;Odax&quot; provided services to the Fleet Training Group in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for a period of 8 weeks.

In February 1968, &quot;Odax&quot; entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and upon completion in September operated in the Charleston area.

In January 1969, &quot;Odax&quot; participated in fleet operations in the Caribbean.

In March 1969, &quot;Odax&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for NATO operations.

In August 1969, &quot;Odax&quot; conducted training operations in the local Charleston area.

==1970s and transfer to Brazilian Navy==

In May 1970, &quot;Odax&quot; departed Charleston for northern Europe for a five-month NATO exercise. During this deployment, while submerged in the Norwegian Sea, &quot;Odax&quot; learned that her home port had been changed to Key West, Florida.

In December 1970, &quot;Odax&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her participation in the NATO operations in Northern Europe. The ship was also awarded her second Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;.

During 1971, &quot;Odax&quot; participated in extensive tests of the new SQS-26 sonar system. Early in the year she took time out to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and to submerge in the Mississippi River for publicity purposes.

In August 1971, &quot;Odax&quot; went to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to provide services for US and NATO training exercises.

In February 1972, &quot;Odax&quot; again provided publicity services by submerging in the Mississippi River in downtown New Orleans during Mardi Gras.

In March and April 1972, in her last military duty, &quot;Odax&quot; provided NATO services during a seven-week unsupported deployment to the Eastern Atlantic.

On 8 July 1972, &quot;Odax&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and transferred to Brazil. Commissioned into the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; as &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot; (S-13), she was decommissioned in 1978 and broken up in 1981.

<text>Multipurpose Community Telecenters are telecentre facilities, which provide public access to a variety of communication and information services, such as libraries and seminar rooms. They are promoted by many governments and organisations including the International Telecommunication Union. They are generally introduced to try to bring access to information and communication technologies in rural communities, but often find significant obstacles in the high cost of connectivity, low digital literacy in the community and high maintenance costs, and are thus forced to shut down. Out of 23 of the MCT&#x27;s built in rural Mexico, only 5 were working 2 years later.

<text>Francisco Suárez (; 5 January 1548 – 25 September 1617) was a Spanish Jesuit priest, philosopher and theologian, one of the leading figures of the School of Salamanca movement. His work is considered a turning point in the history of second scholasticism, marking the transition from its Renaissance to its Baroque phases. According to Christopher Shields and Daniel Schwartz, &quot;figures as distinct from one another in place, time, and philosophical orientation as Leibniz, Grotius, Pufendorf, Schopenhauer and Heidegger, all found reason to cite him as a source of inspiration and influence.&quot;

== Life and career ==
Francisco Suárez was born in Granada, Andalusia (southern Spain), on 5 January 1548. He was the youngest son of a noble family formed by the lawyer Gaspar Suárez de Toledo and his wife Antonia Vázquez de Utiel.

After 3 years of preliminary studies from age 10 onwards, in 1561 Suárez matriculated at the University of Salamanca, and studied law. In 1564, at age sixteen, Suárez entered the Society of Jesus in Salamanca and went through the two years of intense spiritual training under the guidance of Fr. Alonso Rodriguez. In August 1566, Suárez took his first vows as a Jesuit; he then began in October 1566 to study Theology at Salamanca. It seems he was not a promising student at first; in fact, he nearly gave up his matters of study after failing the entrance exam twice. After passing the exam at third attempt, though, things changed.

In 1570, with the completion of his course, Suárez began to teach Philosophy, first at Salamanca as a Scholastic tutor, and then as a professor in the Jesuit college at Segovia. He was ordained in March 1572 in Segovia. He continued to teach Philosophy in Segovia until, in September 1574, he moved to the Jesuit College in Valladolid to teach Theology, a subject he would then teach for the rest of his life. He taught in a succession of different places: Ávila (1575), Segovia (1575), Valladolid (1576) Rome (1580–85), Alcalá (1585–92) and Salamanca (1592–97). In 1597, he moved to Coimbra, some years after the accession of the Spanish (elder line) House of Habsburg to the Portuguese Throne, to take up the principal chair of Theology at the University of Coimbra. He remained there, aside from a brief time teaching at Rome, until his death in 1617.

He wrote on a wide variety of subjects, producing a vast amount of work (his complete works in Latin amount to twenty-six volumes). Suárez&#x27;s writings include treatises on law, the relationship between Church and State, metaphysics, and theology. He is considered the godfather of International Law. His &quot;Disputationes metaphysicae (Metaphysical Disputations&quot;) were widely read in Europe during the 17th century and are considered by some scholars to be his most profound work.

Suárez was regarded during his lifetime as being the greatest living philosopher and theologian, and given the nickname &quot;Doctor Eximius et Pius&quot; (&quot;Exceptional and Pious Doctor&quot;); Pope Gregory XIII attended his first lecture in Rome. Pope Paul V invited him to refute the arguments of James I of England, and wished to retain him near his person, to profit by his knowledge. Philip II of Spain sent him to the University of Coimbra in order to give it prestige, and when Suárez visited the University of Barcelona, the doctors of the university went out to meet him wearing the insignia of their faculties.

After his death in Portugal (in either Lisbon or Coimbra) his reputation grew still greater, and he had a direct influence on such leading philosophers as Hugo Grotius, René Descartes, John Norris, and Gottfried Leibniz. His library was sent to Ethiopia in the mid-17th century, although many of the books went missing, with some of the books arriving in Portuguese Goa. He is buried in the Igreja de São Roque (formerly a Jesuit church) in Lisbon.

== Philosophical thought ==
His most important philosophical achievements were in metaphysics and the philosophy of law. He adhered to a moderate form of Thomism and developed metaphysics as a systematic enquiry.

=== Metaphysics ===

For Suárez, metaphysics was the science of real essences (and existence); it was mostly concerned with real being rather than conceptual being, and with immaterial rather than with material being. He held (along with earlier scholastics) that essence and existence are the same in the case of God (see ontological argument), but disagreed with Aquinas and others that the essence and existence of finite beings are really distinct. He argued that in fact they are merely &quot;conceptually&quot; distinct: rather than being really separable, they can only logically be conceived as separate.

On the vexed subject of universals, he endeavored to steer a middle course between the realism of Duns Scotus and the nominalism of William of Occam. His position is a little bit closer to nominalism than that of Thomas Aquinas. Sometimes he is classified as a &quot;moderate nominalist&quot;, but his admitting of objective precision (&quot;praecisio obiectiva&quot;) ranks him with moderate realists. The only veritable and real unity in the world of existences is the individual; to assert that the universal exists separately &quot;ex parte rei&quot; would be to reduce individuals to mere accidents of one indivisible form. Suárez maintains that, though the humanity of Socrates does not differ from that of Plato, yet they do not constitute &quot;realiter&quot; one and the same humanity; there are as many &quot;formal unities&quot; (in this case, humanities) as there are individuals, and these individuals do not constitute a factual, but only an essential or ideal unity (&quot;In such a way, that many individuals, which are said to be of the same nature, are so: only through the operation of the intellect, not through a substance or essence of things which unites them&quot;). The formal unity, however, is not an arbitrary creation of the mind, but exists &quot;in the nature of the thing, prior [ontologically] to any operation of the intellect&quot;.

His metaphysical work, giving a remarkable effort of systematisation, is a real history of medieval thought, combining the three schools available at that time: Thomism, Scotism and Nominalism. He is also a deep commentator of Arabic or high medieval works. He enjoyed the reputation of being the greatest metaphysician of his time. He thus founded a school of his own, &quot;Suarism&quot; or &quot;Suarezianism&quot;, the chief characteristic principles of which are: 
* the principle of individuation by the proper concrete entity of beings
* the rejection of pure potentiality of matter
* the singular as the object of direct intellectual cognition
* a &quot;distinctio rationis ratiocinatae&quot; between the essence and the existence of created beings
* the possibility of spiritual substance only numerically distinct from one another
* ambition for the hypostatic union as the sin of the fallen angels
* the Incarnation of the Word, even if Adam had not sinned
* the solemnity of the vow only in ecclesiastical law
* the system of Congruism that modifies Molinism by the introduction of subjective circumstances, as well as of place and of time, propitious to the action of efficacious grace, and with predestination &quot;ante praevisa merita&quot;
* the possibility of holding one and the same truth by both science and faith
* the belief in Divine authority contained in an act of faith
* the production of the body and blood of Christ by transubstantiation as constituting the Eucharistic sacrifice
* the final grace of the Blessed Virgin Mary superior to that of the angels and saints combined.

Suárez made an important investigation of being, its properties and division in &quot;Disputationes Metaphysicae&quot; (1597), which influenced the further development of theology within Catholicism. In the second part of the book, disputations 28–53, Suárez fixes the distinction between &quot;ens infinitum&quot; (God) and &quot;ens finitum&quot; (created beings). The first division of being is that between &quot;ens infinitum&quot; and &quot;ens finitum&quot;. Instead of dividing being into infinite and finite, it can also be divided into &quot;ens a se&quot; and &quot;ens ab alio&quot;, i.e., being that is from itself and being that is from another. A second distinction corresponding to this one:&quot;ens necessarium&quot; and &quot;ens contingens&quot;, i.e., necessary being and contingent being. Still another formulation of the distinction is between &quot;ens per essentiam&quot; and &quot;ens per participationem&quot;, i.e., being that exists by reason of its essence and being that exists only by participation in a being that exists on its own (&quot;eigentlich&quot;). This distinction had just been formerly adopted by St. Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;.
A further distinction is between &quot;ens increatum&quot; and &quot;ens creatum&quot;, i.e., uncreated being and created, or creaturely, being. A final distinction is between being as &quot;actus purus&quot; and being as &quot;ens potentiale&quot;, i.e., being as pure actuality and being as potential being. Suárez decided in favor of the first classification of the being into &quot;ens infinitum&quot; and &quot;ens finitum&quot; as the most fundamental, in connection with which he accords the other classifications their due. In the last disputation 54 Suárez deals with &quot;entia rationis&quot; (beings of reason), which are impossible intentional objects, i.e. objects that are created by our minds but cannot exist in actual reality.

=== Theology ===

In theology, Suárez attached himself to the doctrine of Luis Molina, the celebrated Jesuit professor of Évora. Molina tried to reconcile the doctrine of predestination with the freedom of the human will and the predestinarian teachings of the Dominicans by saying that the predestination is consequent upon God&#x27;s foreknowledge of the free determination of man&#x27;s will, which is therefore in no way affected by the fact of such predestination. Suárez endeavoured to reconcile this view with the more orthodox doctrines of the efficacy of grace and special election, maintaining that, though all share in an absolutely sufficient grace, there is granted to the elect a grace which is so adapted to their peculiar dispositions and circumstances that they infallibly, though at the same time quite freely, yield themselves to its influence. This mediatizing system was known by the name of &quot;congruism.&quot;

=== Philosophy of law ===

Here, Suárez&#x27;s main importance stems probably from his work on natural law, and from his arguments concerning positive law and the status of a monarch. In his massive work, &quot;Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore&quot; (1612), he is to some extent the precursor of Grotius and Pufendorf, in making an important distinction between natural law and international law, which he saw as based on custom. Though his method is throughout scholastic, he covers the same ground, and Grotius speaks of him with great respect. The fundamental position of the work is that all legislative as well as all paternal power is derived from God, and that the authority of every law stems ultimately from God&#x27;s eternal law. Suárez denies the patriarchal theory of government and the divine right of kings founded upon it, doctrines popular at that time in England and to some extent on the Continent. He argued against the sort of social contract theory that became dominant among early-modern political philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, but some of his thinking, as transmitted by Grotius, found echoes in later liberal political theory.

He argued that human beings have a social nature bestowed upon them by God, and this includes the potential to make laws. However, when a political society is formed, the authority of the state is not of divine but of human origin; therefore, its nature is chosen by the people involved, and their natural legislative power is given to the ruler. Because they gave this power, they have the right to take it back and to revolt against a ruler, only if the ruler behaves badly towards them, and they must act moderately and justly. In particular, the people must refrain from killing the ruler, no matter how tyrannical he may have become. If a government is imposed on people, on the other hand, they have the right to defend themselves by revolting against it and even kill the tyrannical ruler.

Though Suárez was greatly influenced by Aquinas in his philosophy of law, there are some notable differences. Aquinas broadly defined &quot;law&quot; as &quot;a rule and measure acts, whereby man is induced to act or is restrained from acting&quot; (ST 1-11, qu. 90, art. 1). Suárez argues that this definition is too broad, since it applies to things that are not strictly laws, such as unjust ordinances and counsels of perfection. Suárez also takes issue with Aquinas&#x27; more formal definition of &quot;law&quot; as &quot;an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated&quot; (ST 1-11, qu. 90, art. 4). This definition, he claims, fails to recognize that law is primarily an act of will rather than an act of reason, and would wrongly count orders to particular individuals as being laws. Finally, Suárez disagrees with Aquinas&#x27;s claim that God can change or suspend some of the secondary precepts of the natural law, such as the prohibitions on murder, theft, and adultery (ST 1-11, qu. 94, art. 5). Suárez argues that the natural law is immutable as long as human nature remains unchanged, and that what may appear to be divinely-made changes in the natural law are really just alterations of subject matter. For example, when God orders Hosea to take a &quot;wife of fornications&quot; (i.e., have sex with a prostitute), this is not an exemption from God&#x27;s prohibition of adultery. &quot;For God has power to transfer to a man &quot;dominium&quot; over a woman without her consent, and to effect such a bond between them that, by virtue of this bond, the union is no longer one of fornication.&quot;

In 1613, at the instigation of Pope Paul V, Suárez wrote a treatise dedicated to the Christian princes of Europe, entitled &quot;Defensio catholicae fidei contra anglicanae sectae errores&quot; (&quot;Defense of the Universal Catholic Faith Against the Errors of the Anglican Sect&quot;). This was directed against the oath of allegiance which James I required from his subjects.

James (himself a talented scholar) caused it to be burned by the common hangman and forbade its perusal under the &#x27;severest penalties, complaining bitterly to Philip III of Spain for harbouring in his dominions a declared enemy of the throne and majesty of kings.

== Influence ==
The contributions of Suarez to metaphysics and theology exerted significant influence over 17th and 18th century scholastic theology among both Roman Catholics and Protestants.

Thanks in part to the strength of Suárez&#x27;s Jesuit order, his &quot;Disputationes Metaphysicae &quot;was widely taught in the Catholic schools of Spain, Portugal and Italy.

It also spread from these schools to many Lutheran universities in Germany, where the text was studied especially by those who favoured Melanchthon rather than Luther&#x27;s attitude towards philosophy. In a number of seventeenth-century Lutheran universities the &quot;Disputationes&quot; served as a textbook in philosophy.

In a similar way, Suárez had major influence in the Reformed tradition of German and Dutch schools for both metaphysics and law, including international law. His work was highly praised, for example, by Hugo Grotius (1583–1645).

His influence is evident in the writings of Bartholomaeus Keckermann (1571–1609), Clemens Timpler (1563–1624), Gilbertus Jacchaeus (1578–1628), Johann Heinrich Alsted (1588–1638), Antonius Walaeus (1573–1639), and Johannes Maccovius (Jan Makowski; 1588–1644), among others. This influence was so pervasive that by 1643 it provoked the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Revius to publish his book-length response: &quot;Suarez repurgatus.&quot; Suárez&#x27;s &quot;De legibus&quot; was cited as among the best books on law by the Puritan Richard Baxter, and Baxter&#x27;s friend Matthew Hale drew on it for his natural-law theory.

== Criticism ==
The views of Suarez upon the human origin of political order, and his defense of tyrannicide emanating from popular dissent were heavily criticized by English philosopher Robert Filmer in his work &quot;Patriarcha, Or the Natural Power of Kings&quot;. Filmer believed Calvinists and Catholics like Suarez to be dangerous opponents of divine right monarchy, legitimized by the supremacy of fathers upon their offspring, which Filmer claimed could be traced back to Adam.

<text>USS &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; (SS-483), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the leopard seal. Her keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 7 November 1944. She was launched on 2 March 1945 sponsored by Hon. Margaret Chase Smith, United States Congresswoman from Maine, and commissioned on 11 June 1945.

==United States Service==
===1940s===

Following shakedown off the New England coast, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; was ordered to the Pacific War Zone. However, hostilities with Japan ceased before the submarine&#x27;s departure date; and she remained in the Atlantic. The submarine then proceeded to Key West, Florida, and she remained in Florida waters through 1946 providing services to the Antisubmarine Development Force.

In January 1947, she returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for her first shipyard overhaul. Next came training exercises in the Key West area until late 1948, when she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) modernization. Upon completion, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 6 and home ported at Norfolk, Virginia. In November 1949, she joined other units in cold water exercises in the Atlantic. During February and March 1950, the submarine participated in maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea.

===1950s===

From August through November, she joined the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, visiting ports of Italy, France, and Sicily, before returning home. From December 1950 to April 1951 &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; was undergoing overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

For the next two years, she operated in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, participating in fleet training exercises. In 1951 she recovered at sea the remains of Raymond Lewis of Brooklyn, New York, a victim of the FV &quot;Pelican&quot; disaster, which involved an overloaded party fishing boat that sank off the coast of Montauk on 1 September 1951. In September and October 1952, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; participated in NATO operation &quot;Emigrant,&quot; and then cruised in Bermuda waters, until entering the Charleston Naval Shipyard in December for overhaul. Returning to duty in April 1953, the submarine operated in the vicinity of Newfoundland and Iceland in operation &quot;Mariner,&quot; before returning to warmer waters in the Caribbean.

&quot;Sea Leopard&quot;&#x27;s second deployment to the Mediterranean took place in May and June 1954 and was followed by her participation in NATO exercise &quot;New Broom II,&quot; in which she made successful simulated attacks on NATO convoys. The submarine entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in October for a six-month overhaul. The yard work was followed by her participation in &quot;LantPhibEx,&quot; as a member of forces opposing a simulated amphibious assault on the coast of North Carolina.

In February and March 1956, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot;, along with other units of SubRon 6, set sail for the Caribbean and operation &quot;Springboard.&quot; She then returned to Norfolk for local operations until March 1957, when she again joined the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. In June, she participated in festivities celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Netherlands Submarine Force at Rotterdam, before sailing to Charleston, South Carolina, for an overhaul. Upon its completion in January 1958, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; joined operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in the Caribbean and then returned to Norfolk for local operations. Joining Task Group Alfa, she participated in operations to develop antisubmarine warfare tactics and readiness, until undergoing restricted availability at Charleston Naval Shipyard (August to October 1959) to install a new high capacity battery.

===1960s===

During 1960, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; operated in the Atlantic in training exercises and fleet operations until 23 October, when she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for overhaul. Following completion in April 1961, she returned to Norfolk and operated locally until 19 August when she joined Task Force 69 in the Mediterranean to participate in NATO operation &quot;Checkmate&quot; and visit Rota, Spain; Malta and Naples, Italy. On 3 October, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; sailed from the Mediterranean for northern Europe and NATO operation &quot;Devil Spread.&quot;

Arriving back at Norfolk on 10 November, she again joined Task Group Alfa for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training until February 1963. She then participated in operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in the Caribbean. Immediately following the loss of Thresher on 10 April 1963, she conducted an at-sea helicopter transfer of a crew member who had left the Thresher just three weeks earlier. In July, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; rejoined Task Group Alfa, until entering Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 16 December for an overhaul. In October 1964, after refresher training out of New London, Connecticut, the submarine returned to Norfolk to resume normal duties as a unit of SubRon 6, providing ASW services to units of the Second Fleet.

In March 1965, she joined Task Group Alfa, deploying to the Mediterranean and then returning to the Atlantic to participate in ASW exercises with that group until 24 November 1966. On 27 December, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul. In July 1967, she conducted type training with submarines and . The remainder of 1967 was spent in the Norfolk area.

In 1968, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; participated in exercises &quot;Aged Daddy V&quot; and &quot;Rugby Match,&quot; and joined the search for the ill-fated submarine .
From July through October, she operated with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, and upon her return, she remained at Norfolk for the rest of the year.

On 2 June 1969, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; deployed on a special operation to the North Atlantic, returning to Norfolk on 15 August to operate in that area until entering Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 17 January 1970 for a six-month overhaul. In October, she participated in operation &quot;Eyebolt,&quot; and then remained at Norfolk until getting underway early in January 1971 to participate in operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in January and February. From 18 May to 2 September, &quot;Sea Leopard&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean; and, following her return to Norfolk, she was deployed from Key West in the early 1970s.

==Brazilian Navy Service==

&quot;Sea Leopard&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list on 27 March 1973 and transferred to Brazil, where she was commissioned into the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; as
&quot;Bahia&quot; (S-12).
She inherited both her name and hull number from an earlier &quot;Bahia&quot;, ex-USS &quot;Plaice&quot; (SS-390), which the Brazilians converted into a museum ship in 1972. This later &quot;Bahia&quot; served as an active duty submarine in the Brazilian Navy until 1993 when she was relegated to dockside training duties.

&quot;Bahia&quot; was sold for scrap in 1998. Her sail is preserved at the National Maritime Museum in São Francisco do Sul, Brazil.

Modeled after the United States Secret Service, the South Korean PSS is an independent agency responsible for the protection of the president of South Korea, the prime minister of South Korea and their offices, residence and respective families, as well as heads of state visiting the country. The agency also provides services to former presidents and their immediate families for 10 years after the end of their terms and transfers them to the National Police Agency. The agents go through years of rigorous training, background, physical health, mental health and educational checks before they officially become a PSS agent and get their first assignment.

The unit is currently being commanded by Yoo Yeon-sang, a vice-ministerial Head of the PSS. Its headquarters and related support units were based near the Blue House. In May 2022, its headquarters moved to now-Presidential Office Building following relocation of President&#x27;s office to the defense ministry building.

==History==

The PSS had been established in 1949 as the Kyong Mu Dae Presidential Security Police. Its name soon changed in 1960 to the Blue House Presidential Police with a Security Force raised in 1961 to closely guard Park Chung Hee.

The unit had a name change again, this time to the PSS, after the PSS Law 157 had passed in 1963 with Hong Jong Chul as its first chief under the direction of the Gyeongmundae Police Force. Yet Pak Chong-gyu headed the PSS from 1963 to 1974. PSS responsibilities were increased after North Korean soldiers of the 124th Army Unit attacked the Blue House in 1968.

In 1974, the PSS was granted more power over the South Korean military and various law enforcement agencies under the enactment of Security Committee for presidential protection (Executive Order 7246) and of Security Control Unit for presidential protection (Executive Order 7246) after Park Chung Hee&#x27;s wife, Yuk Young-soo, was killed.

The abolition of the Security Committee for presidential protection (Executive Order 9692) and abolition of Security Control Unit for presidential protection (Executive Order 9692) came in 1979 after Park Chung Hee had been assassinated. In 1981, the PSS was mandated, by the revision of PSS directives, to protect former South Korean presidents and their families.

The PSS was involved in the close protection of Pope John Paul II during an attempt to attack him when he visited the country on May 6, 1984, in Seoul.

On February 1, 1989, the Cheongnamdae (Presidential retreat) guard squad was formed.

On April 1, 1993, the Mugunghwa Dongsa (Clearing away of the security house) division was created to act as a counter-terrorism unit. On March 3, 1999, a PSS Multi Security Training Center was created.

During the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the PSS established the Cheong Wa Dae World Cup Safety Measures Team and the World Cup Security &amp; Safety Control Division to bolster security on South Korean soil.

The PSS was relieved of their guard duties of the Blue House on April 18, 2003, as jurisdiction was given to the Chungcheongbuk-do Provincial Government. On January 1, 2005, the Pusan APEC Security Safety Control Group was established by the PSS.

The Presidential Security Safety Measures Committee was legalized as a committee on March 10, 2005.

PSS has been through numerous changes across administrations, such as the status of its head – ministerial or vice-ministerial – and organisation itself from the office to the division as well as its hierarchy within the Office of the President. President Moon Jae-in lowered the status of the head of PSS to a vice ministerial level and downgraded its status to an independent division under the President.

==Duties==
Among the duties conducted by PSS agents include close protection for the following:
# The President of South Korea and their family
# The President-elect and their family
# The Acting President and their spouse
# Former presidents, as well as their spouses and children (will receive protection from the Security Service for a maximum of ten (10) years after leaving office, unless the protected subjects decline)
# The heads of states or the heads of governments of foreign countries visiting South Korea, and their spouses
# Any other domestic and foreign persons that the Chief of the Presidential Security Service deems to be necessary to protect

==Organization==
As of 2008, the PSS had been organized into the following:
*Head of the PSS
**Inspector General
*Vice Head of the PSS
**Headquarters for Innovation &amp; Planning
**Headquarters for Administration
**Headquarters for Protection
**Headquarters for Intelligence &amp; Security
**Headquarters for Education &amp; Training
The PSS has a code and a pledge that its agents must abide by at all times:

==Code and Pledge==
===Code===

*Unity - The will for unity amongst all and conformity with the President reflecting the teamwork orientated characteristic of security duties
*Loyalty - The very basic mental attitude of security agents towards the nation and its people
*Eternity - Security duties pursue eternal honor to the end by being with the President with a precondition of self-sacrifice
*Honor - Expertise and dignity of the security duty based on sacrifice and service

===Pledge===

# One, we will lay down our lives for the successful execution of our duties.
# Another, we will act in a righteous and truthful manner.
# Third, we will firmly unify on the basis of mutual trust.
# Fourth, we will guard the preservation of public peace like our lives.

<text>USS &quot;Irex&quot; (SS-482), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the irex, one of the oceanic fishes belonging to the family &quot;carangidae&quot;.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Irex&quot;′s keel was laid down on 2 October 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 26 January 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Allen J. Ellender, wife of Senator Ellender of Louisiana, and commissioned on 14 May 1945.

==Service history==

===1945-1956===
After shakedown in the New London, Connecticut, area, &quot;Irex&quot; sailed for the Pacific via the Panama Canal. While she was in the Canal Zone, the war ended. &quot;Irex&quot; was ordered to Key West, Florida, where she joined Submarine Squadron 4. She spent the remainder of the year there and at Guantanamo Bay conducting exercises. By December 1946 the Navy had completed plans for the modern telescopic snorkel (a device to enable diesel-powered submarines to run submerged for long periods of time), and &quot;Irex&quot; was ordered to Portsmouth for installation and test of this equipment. She spent July 1947 to February 1948 evaluating her new apparatus and joined Submarine Squadron 8 at New London as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first operational snorkel submarine.

For the next three years &quot;Irex&quot; trained out of New London and off the Virginia Capes. In May 1951 she was assigned patrol duty in the North Atlantic and in August commenced operations out of Key West and Cuba. Returning to New London in the fall, &quot;Irex&quot; continued her important training out of New England and in the Caribbean Sea until 26 October 1953 when she sailed for the Mediterranean Sea to join the Sixth Fleet. Returning to New London 3 February 1954 &quot;Irex&quot; resumed her operations along the East Coast and in the Caribbean for the next two years.

&quot;Irex&quot; again deployed in 1956 to the Mediterranean with units of the Sixth Fleet. In the developing Middle East crisis that culminated in the nationalization of the Suez Canal in July 1956, and armed conflict between Egypt and the forces of France, Israel, and the United Kingdom, U.S. Naval forces acted early to support America&#x27;s policy. In February, patrols in the Red Sea and along the Israeli-Egyptian border were established as a means of expressing American interest in the peaceful outcome of the crisis. Returning to New London, she resumed her operations and also served as training ship for submarine students.

===1957-1971===
During early 1957 &quot;Irex&quot; participated in fleet exercises and served as training boat. In July she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where she was fitted out with a new type plastic sail. The plastic sail, which replaced the World War II conning tower, was lighter in weight, higher, and acted as a stabilizer. With the exception of one tour to the Mediterranean (13 September – 20 December 1958) and training cruises to Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia, &quot;Irex&quot; continued her operations out of New London for the next year and a half. In early 1960 she took part in fleet exercises in the North Atlantic before returning home 3 March. After operations out of New London, and a training cruise to Halifax &quot;Irex&quot; deployed 1 August 1961 for submarine warfare training with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. She returned to New London in November, ranging south to Bermuda and north to New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, as she trained reservists and men of the New London Submarine School. She based winter operations January to March 1963 from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, then was overhauled in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard before resuming training at New London. In October 1964 she again sailed for the Mediterranean, taking time out during this Sixth Fleet tour to transit Suez Canal for CENTO exercises in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea. She returned home mid-January 1965 to aid in the development of antisubmarine warfare tactics, joined U.S.-Canadian warfare exercises reaching northward to Nova Scotia, then returned home to New London in November 1965 and continued local training duties into 1967. &quot;Irex&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 November 1969 and sold for scrap and broken up on 13 September 1971.

<doc id="1058327" wikidata="Q629268" url="?curid=1058327" title="Talbot Samba">
<text>The Talbot Samba is a city car manufactured by the PSA Group in the former Simca factory in Poissy, France, and marketed under the short-lived modern-day Talbot brand from 1981 to 1986. Based on the Peugeot 104, it and the Talbot Express were the only Talbots not inherited from Chrysler Europe, engineered by PSA alone. It was also the last new Talbot car to be launched. Its demise in 1986 was effectively the end of the Talbot brand for passenger cars. Launched initially as a three-door hatchback, it was also for some time the only small car available in a factory-ordered cabrio body style, and the most economical car in Europe.

==Development==

===Background===
The PSA Group, formed in 1976 when Peugeot bought out its competitor, Citroën, took over the former Chrysler Europe in 1979; one of its first decisions was to rebrand all of the models manufactured in the French and British factories to Talbot. Among the models inherited from Chrysler was the Scottish-built rear-wheel drive Chrysler Sunbeam, the only small car in the lineup.

The Sunbeam was originally conceived by Chrysler as a stopgap model, developed to keep the Linwood works running—it was based on the running gear of the earlier Avenger made there—while helping the company to maintain a foothold in the growing small car market. Aware that a more modern design was needed to compete with upcoming front-wheel drive rivals, Chrysler undertook some development work on a shortened version of the Chrysler Horizon (which had the development code &quot;C2&quot;), dubbed &quot;C2-short&quot;, but it was cut short by the company&#x27;s financial problems and plans to divest Chrysler Europe.

PSA decided that the Linwood plant would be unprofitable to maintain and should be closed, which meant an end to both the Avenger and Sunbeam model lines, further emphasizing the need for a new small car in the Talbot lineup. On the eve of the 1980s, PSA&#x27;s city cars lineup consisted of models based on the veteran front-wheel drive 1972 Peugeot 104, which came in a shorter three-door and longer five-door version. Citroën rebadged the short-wheelbase 104 as the Citroën LN, and the long-wheelbase chassis formed the base of the five-door Citroën Visa.

===Decision===

In 1979, PSA decided that their new small Talbot would also be based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common underpinnings allowed the new model, known internally as project &quot;C15&quot; (later renamed to &quot;T15&quot; to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much internal competition, a wheelbase situated in between the three- and five-door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.

===Styling===
As with previous Talbot and Chrysler Europe models, styling of the &quot;T15&quot; was the responsibility of the British design centre in Whitley, Coventry. The stylists were limited by the need to retain the entire body structure of the 104, and allegedly were given Peugeot&#x27;s own proposal of a 104 facelift as a starting point. The resulting design was quite different from and more modern-looking than its progenitor; only the bonnet and tailgate were shared, and the car was given a distinctive front end in Chrysler/Talbot &quot;international&quot; style.

==Launch==
Production of the new car started in October 1981, and it was officially launched as the Talbot Samba in December. Unlike the Horizon, 1510/Alpine or Solara, which were made simultaneously in France and England, the new Samba was assembled only in Poissy. The engine lineup included three versions of the four cylinder PSA X engine, which the Samba shared with its Peugeot and Citroën siblings, coupled with three trim levels. The base LE and LS came with the 954 cc &quot;XV&quot;, the GL with the 1124 cc &quot;XW&quot; and the top-of-the-line GLS with the largest 1360 cc &quot;XY engine&quot;. The GLS was also available with a five-speed transmission. Power outputs are respectively. The engine was tilted 72 degrees backwards to allow the spare tire to under the bonnet without having to raise it, and drove the gearbox through a set of step-down pinions. The GL was rated as &quot;Europe&#x27;s most economical car&quot; according to the official EEC fuel consumption figures, bettering the previously triumphant Renault 5, but later lost the title to the Austin Metro.

===Cabrio===

In an effort to make the vehicle stand out in the market against similar rivals, which included its own derivatives, Peugeot added a more glamorous two-door cabriolet to the standard three-door hatchback. Although announced at the hatchback&#x27;s launch, the first models were not available until 1982. Designed and built by the Italian coachbuilder Pininfarina, who had been building open-top Peugeots since the 1960s, it came only with the 1360 cc engine; two engine versions were offered, 53 or 59 kilowatts (72 or 80 PS)—the former was dropped after 1984, at which time a slightly revised cabriolet was released featuring the later style 104 dashboard, twin carburettors and a lined hood; the 80 bhp engine was shared with the Rallye. At the time of its launch it was the only cabrio small car available from the manufacturer, although other models subsequently entered the market segment created by the Samba, including PSA&#x27;s own Citroën Visa Décapotable. Pininfarina built 13,062 Samba cabriolets.

===Rallye===

Following the rallying successes of the Simca 1000 and the Talbot Sunbeam, PSA launched the Samba Rallye in 1983. Fitted with the 1219 cc &quot;XZ&quot; version of the X engine, delivering 66 kilowatt (90 PS), it came in either white or red, with a hood scoop and side stripes. In 1984, a version with the 1360 cc unit producing 59 kilowatt (80 PS) was launched, without the stripes. A special rallye-only Group B model, officially called the Peugeot Talbot Sport Samba Rallye preceded the later Peugeot 205 T16, with a 1285 cc, 96 kilowatt engine (130 PS).

====Talbot Samba Rally Group B====
After the success with amateur drivers of the Simca Rallye and the 104 GR2 and GR5, the Peugeot Talbot Sport group under the leadership of Jean Todt decided to homologate the Talbot Samba Rallye in group B. It proved effective on asphalt.

In January 1983, the Samba type SRE was homologated, and two-hundred examples were produced by the PTS group - mainly aimed at private drivers. While still competitive, the Samba Rallye was considerably less expensive than other brands. Its weight is , thanks to the use of fiberglass body parts (the doors, the rear hatch, the engine cover). Suspension is coil overs, while the brakes are AP Lockheed four-piston calipers at the front and aluminum two-piston calipers for the rear. Also fitted was an aluminum roll bar, faster steering rack, Makrolon windows, hydraulic handbrake, one-piece PTS rims, front and rear anti-roll bar, four-in-two-in-one exhaust, oil cooler, and a reinforced rear axle. The overhead camshaft engine was increased to 1,285 cc and produced , all coupled to a short gearbox with self-locking differential.

;Talbot Samba Rallye Group B SRE2 evolution
In January 1984 the Samba Rallye evolution type SR2 is homologated. The changes are numerous: increased tracks with wide fenders in polyester, triangulated front axle, new engine cradle, lengthened and reinforced transmission gimbals, fiber front bumper with brake cooling scoops, new anti-roll bar, standard triple-Y exhaust (4–2–1), adoption of a new generation front and rear AP brake, specific steering rods and the possibility of choosing five different roll cage models (aluminum or steel).

The engine increases to 1,296 cc and with the adoption of a more aggressive camshaft and larger intake ducts.

Quickly a catalog including all the Samba group B parts is offered by the Peugeot team. This is how some private pilots could have their own Group B Samba built by small workshops like Mathiot, Brozzi, or Bouhier. This has the effect of increasing the number of Samba group B beyond the initial two hundred copies released.

The car notably won the 1985 Al Fito Hill Climb, with Spaniard Paulino Diaz.

;1,440 and 1,550 cc evolutions
Two engine manufacturers are at the origin of the development of these ultimate evolutions. They are Mathiot and Brozzi, they obtain these displacements by changing the engine bore to 78.50 mm for the 1440 and 80 mm for 1550 cc. These engines were already present on the Peugeot 104 Group 5 as well as on the Citroën Visa Mille Pistes.

To fit in with rally regulations, the little Samba had to be ballasted in order to reach the minimum weight required for cars in the 1600 cc class. On the other hand, in hillclimbing, it was at the right weight of 675 kg and in this discipline, it became an even more successful machine.

==Later developments==
In 1982, the Talbot Group was merged into Peugeot within PSA, and responsibility for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, and some of the designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model&#x27;s aging and partly because of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created strong internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.

To sustain interest in the Samba towards the end of its life, PSA launched a few concept and special versions of the model. The Copacabana was a Samba-based concept car, featuring body elements painted in garish colors. It was followed by the 1984 Samba Sympa production model, targeted at &quot;young buyers&quot;, which came in silver metallic paint, with a choice of yellow, red or blue highlights and either a radio or a sunroof. In 1985, the sunroof became standard and only yellow highlights were available. The Samba Bahia (marketed as the Samba Trio in the UK) was a 1985 model, also targeted at younger customers. It came with the 1.1 litre engine, denim-covered seats, and a sunroof, and was painted in metallic blue. The Samba Style model was launched with both radio and sunroof as standard, but not the colorful highlights, essentially to facilitate the sales of the last Samba series.

While interest was waning as the 1980s progressed, the Samba was the only remaining Talbot to sell in meaningful numbers as the brand was gradually phased out. Peugeot had been working on developing a replacement for the Samba as late as 1984, which would have been based on the forthcoming Citroën AX, but this project was abandoned as Peugeot took the decision to phase out the Talbot brand, and the Peugeot 205 was proving so popular that Peugeot felt little need for a third car of this size within the group.

The Citroën AX was launched without a twin in 1986, and the only other Talbot in development, the Arizona family hatchback, was launched instead as the Peugeot 309 at the end of 1985. Production of the Samba ended in May 1986, by which time 270,555 had been made, signalling the beginning of the end of the Talbot brand for passenger cars, the death knell finally sounding the following year when the last Horizon rolled off the production line in Finland – although the brand survived on the Talbot Express, one of the Sevel Sud vans, until 1994.

The Talbot Samba is almost extinct on UK roads with only 12 remaining as of 2018.

==Jeremy Clarkson video==
In Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s 2009 DVD Duel, a 1984 Talbot Samba Cabriolet was destroyed by hurling it from a catapult into a wall, with a speed camera nearby showing that its speed was before it hit the wall and exploded.

<text>Market Deeping is a market town and civil parish in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England, on the north bank of the River Welland and the A15 road. The population of the town at the 2011 census was 6,008.

==History==
The town&#x27;s market has been held since at least 1220.

The town developed around the commercial use of the River Welland, which today is backed onto by many pleasant Georgian stone buildings. The town is part of a group of Lincolnshire villages and hamlets, collectively called the Deepings, which include Deeping Gate, West Deeping, Deeping St James and Langtoft. The Grade II listed limestone Packhorse Bridge was built in 1651, just after the English Civil War. The bridge was narrow, allowing for single file traffic only. Refuge ledges were built into either side of the bridge for pedestrian safety. A marker on the side of the bridge indicates the level of the water during the floods of 1880. The river was once of great commercial importance, navigable as far as Stamford. Today the river trade has all but gone and the navigation greatly diminished - its head now terminating at the derelict lock at Deeping St James, just upstream of the Packhorse Bridge. Although no longer navigable for commercial traffic, the river provides pleasant scenic walks. Access to the town from the south nowadays is via a later and wider road bridge with two lanes for traffic and pavements on either side.

The £10 million A15 and A16 bypass opened in July 1998, which incorporates a stretch of single and dual carriageway. The A16 has now moved to the former A1073 from Crowland to Spalding, and the bypass became the A1175 in October 2011.

==Governance==

The town is part of the South Holland and The Deepings Parliamentary Constituency but is also part of South Kesteven District. It sends three district councillors to SKDC which is based in Grantham. It currently has one Conservative and two Independents although since 1983 it has mostly returned Liberals and Independents. The first Green Party candidate stood in 2007 and was runner-up.

The town and some of the surrounding villages including West Deeping and Tallington form the new Deepings West and Rural division of Lincolnshire County Council which will elects one councillor (currently a Conservative since the May 2017 elections).

The town elects 13 councillors to form Market Deeping Town Council which is based at Market Deeping Town Hall.

==Geography==
Market Deeping, with 2,462 households, is the largest of The Deepings followed by the large village Deeping St James. The River Welland forms the border with the Peterborough unitary authority area. It is the seventh-lowest-lying town in terms of height above sea level in England. The town is known for its stone buildings dating back to the 17th century, its largely 15th-century church dedicated to St. Guthlac and the remains of a market cross.

==Economy==
On 1 February 1994 Prince Edward, Duke of Kent visited Park Air Electronics on the Northfields Industrial Estate, accompanied by Sir Henry Nevile, then the Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. This company is now called Park Air Systems, owned by Northrop Grumman. &quot;Best of British&quot; magazine is based on Market Gate. In July 2010 the Eventus Business Centre was opened on the Northfields Industrial Estate, a purpose-built business centre financed through Lincolnshire County Council.

==Community==
===Education===
The main secondary school is the Deepings School, in neighbouring Deeping St. James, an academy school with a comprehensive intake.

<doc id="1058336" wikidata="Q7871683" url="?curid=1058336" title="USS Medregal">
<text>USS &quot;Medregal&quot; (SS-480/AGSS-480), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the medregal, a streamlined, fast-swimming, bluish-colored fish of the jack family which abounds in waters of the West Indies and in the Atlantic as far north as the Carolinas.

==Construction==
&quot;Medregal&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, on 21 August 1944. She was launched on 15 December 1944, sponsored by Mrs. A. H. Taylor, and was commissioned on 14 April 1945.

==World War II service==
&quot;Medregal&quot; departed Portsmouth in April 1945. A collision with a U.S. destroyer escort off the north coast of Panama while submerged caused major damage to the periscope shears and radar, requiring a return to Portsmouth just at the time that Germany surrendered. After repairs and Air/Sea Rescue modifications, &quot;Medregal&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, on 16 June, and steamed to participate in final operations in the Pacific against the Japanese. The surrender of Japan halted her long Pacific voyage and she returned to the Canal Zone, thence to Key West, Florida, for operations with Submarine Squadron 4.

==Post-war service==
===Atlantic Fleet service===
From late 1945 to mid-1957 &quot;Medregal&quot; operated out of Key West, training Reserves, supporting activities of the Fleet Sonar School, and taking part in antisubmarine warfare exercises. Her cruises sent her along the east coast from Florida to Virginia, into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and to operating areas in the western Atlantic. Periodically she deployed to Guantanamo Bay and Havana, Cuba, as well us to Puerto Rico and islands of the West Indies. From March to November 1952 she underwent conversion to a Fleet Snorkel submarine at Charleston, South Carolina.

On 17 June 1957 &quot;Medregal&quot; entered Charleston Naval Shipyard for conversion to a missile-guidance submarine. She completed overhaul 22 November, thence steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, for operations with Submarine Squadron 6. During the next 18 months she participated in intermittent missile-evaluation projects in the Caribbean off the Virgin Islands and in the Atlantic out off Puerto Rico.

===Pacific Fleet service===
Assigned to Submarine Squadron 3 on 10 July 1959 &quot;Medregal&quot; departed Norfolk 25 July and steamed to Pearl Harbor, arriving 24 August. She served in Hawaiian waters until sailing 9 January 1960 to the Far East, arriving at U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka on 26 January. During the next five months she conducted training and evaluation exercises with units of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and ranged the western Pacific from Japan to the Philippines.

Returning to Pearl Harbor 1 July, &quot;Medregal&quot; resumed type and squadron operations between Hawaii and the West Coast. Between September 1961 and March 1962 she made a second deployment with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. In May 1962, Medregal and USS Carbonero, SS-337 participated in Operation Dominic I, Shot Frigate Bird near Christmas Island (now Kiribati). It was the first and only test of a fully operational Polaris missile with a 600 kt thermonuclear warhead, fired from USS Ethan Allan, SSBN-608. In October she steamed to the West Coast for ASW (SLAMEX) and Reserve training out of Puget Sound. She returned to Pearl Harbor in mid-December and for the next two years she maintained her pattern of operations between the Hawaiian Islands and the West Coast.

&quot;Medregal&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for WestPac in mid-April 1965. Steaming first to Australia, she visited Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne, and participated in the commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Thence, in May she sailed to the Philippines for operations out of Subic Bay. On 13 July 1965 she was in a collision with a freighter while submerged in the South China Sea. Returned to Subic Bay for repairs. Extensive damage was done to the sail, all periscopes and snorkel system were completely inoperative. After patched up in Subic Bay, returned to Pearl Harbor for a short while then to Mare Island, Vellejo, Calif. for major repairs. Arrived back in Pearl Harbor late December 1965.

Back in Pearl Harbor late in 1965, &quot;Medregal&quot; operated there until departure for Japan 2 July 1966. After reaching Yokosuka on 15 July, she joined Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers and destroyers for ASW operations in the western Pacific, and readiness and alert maneuvers with ships of the Republic of China Navy (based in Taiwan). During the rest of the year she continued to support peacekeeping operations in the troubled Far East.

In January 1967, &quot;Medregal&quot; returned to her home port in Hawaii where she resumed her type training and squadron exercises with SubRon 1. She continued duty out of Pearl Harbor until 1 May when she was assigned to SubRon 3 out of San Diego, California. On 1 May 1967, &quot;Medregal&quot; was reclassified with hull classification symbol AGSS-480.

On 6 February 1969 &quot;Medregal&quot; sank the as a target off the coast of California. &quot;Redfish&quot; was a combat veteran of World War II.

On 24 June 1969 &quot;Medregal&quot; departed San Diego for her final WestPac cruise. Stops included Hawaii, Guam, Viet Nam(twice), Subic Bay/Manila (Philippines), Chinhae (South Korea), Yokosuka/Kobe (Japan), Kaohsiung (Taiwan) and Hong Kong. &quot;Medregal&quot; arrived back in San Diego on 24 December 1969. She continued home port operations there until August 1970.

&quot;Medregal&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1970 and sold for scrapping 13 June 1972.

<text>USS &quot;Tusk&quot; (SS-426), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tusk, an alternate name for the cusk, a large edible saltwater fish related to the cod. Her keel was laid down on 23 August 1943 at Philadelphia by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company. She was launched on 8 July 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Carolyn Park Mills, and commissioned on 11 April 1946.

&quot;Tusk&quot; and are erroneously listed with the &quot;Tench&quot; class in some sources, as their hull numbers are in the sequence assigned to that class.

== Shakedown and GUPPY Conversion ==

&quot;Tusk&quot; completed her shakedown cruise in the southern Atlantic with a round of goodwill visits to Latin American ports. She called at Rio de Janeiro and Bahia in Brazil, Curaçao in the Netherlands West Indies, and at Colón in the Panama Canal Zone before returning to New London, Connecticut, in June. For the next year, she conducted operations along the East Coast between New London and Wilmington, North Carolina. During the first month of 1947, &quot;Tusk&quot; participated in a fleet tactical exercise in the Central Atlantic. A three-month overhaul at Philadelphia, followed by oceanographic work along the Atlantic shelf in conjunction with Columbia University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution occupied her until October 1947 when she entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) conversion.

Over the next seven months, &quot;Tusk&quot; received extensive modifications to improve her submerged performance characteristics. Four &quot;greater capacity&quot; batteries replaced her old larger ones. Her hull became more streamlined—the anchors were recessed into the hull and the propeller guards were removed—to improve her overall hydrodynamic design for underwater operations. Her sail was streamlined and enlarged to house the snorkel, a device added to allow her to operate on diesel power at periscope depth and to recharge her batteries while running submerged. All of these changes helped to convert &quot;Tusk&quot; from simply a submersible surface ship into a truer submarine. They increased her submerged range; and, though she lost about two knots in surface speed, her submerged speed increased from just under to about .

The newly converted submarine returned to active duty early in the summer of 1948. She conducted her shakedown training and made a simulated war patrol to the Panama Canal Zone in June and July. She returned to the United States in August and visited the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, where her presence allowed about 1000 fourth-classmen to see at firsthand the latest development in submarine design. That fall and winter, &quot;Tusk&quot; resumed normal operations, participating in exercises with other United States and NATO forces. She ranged from the Caribbean Sea in the south to above the Arctic Circle in the north. The beginning of 1949 brought a more restricted radius of operations. During the first six months of that year, she served with Submarine Development Group 2 based at Newport, Rhode Island. In July, &quot;Tusk&quot; rejoined the multinational forces of NATO for another round of exercises in the North Atlantic. During these exercises, she visited Derry, Northern Ireland, and Portsmouth, England.

== Loss of &quot;Cochino&quot; ==

During the final phase of those exercises, &quot;Tusk&quot; was operating in a unit which also included the submarine . On 25 August, while steaming through a gale off the coast of Norway, &quot;Cochino&quot; suffered an explosion in one of her batteries. &quot;Tusk&quot; rushed to the aid of the stricken submarine, providing medical supplies for &quot;Cochino&quot;″s injured by way of life rafts. One such raft capsized in heavy seas sending a &quot;Cochino&quot; officer and a civilian employee of the Bureau of Ships into the icy Arctic Sea. Both were recovered, but during the administration of artificial respiration on board &quot;Tusk&quot;, another wave broke over her deck washing away the civilian and 11 &quot;Tusk&quot; crewmen. Only four sailors were subsequently rescued. After those tragic events, &quot;Tusk&quot; and the limping &quot;Cochino&quot; headed for Hammerfest, Norway. Along the way, another explosion erupted in &quot;Cochino&quot;″s aft battery. The second detonation sealed &quot;Cochino&quot;″s fate. Water poured through her battered hull. &quot;Tusk&quot; came alongside in heavy seas and lashed herself to the sinking submarine. Under the worst possible conditions, &quot;Tusk&quot; took all of &quot;Cochino&quot;″s crew off safely. Minutes later &quot;Cochino&quot; took her final plunge and &quot;Tusk&quot; headed for Hammerfest.

== 1950s ==

That fall, the submarine returned to the United States to resume East Coast operations out of New London in support of the Submarine School. She made cruises north to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and south to Bermuda. Her duty with the Submarine School continued until the middle of 1951 when she was assigned once more to Submarine Development Group 2. That assignment, punctuated by regular exercises with the fleet, continued until the summer of 1952 when she returned to an operational unit, Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 10. Normal East Coast duty out of New London lasted until late in the year at which time &quot;Tusk&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for a six-month tour with the Sixth Fleet. Her return to the United States early in the summer of 1953 brought more local operations out of New London. During the first part of 1954, the submarine operated in the Caribbean. Then, after four months of local operations out of New London, she sailed for northern European waters. That tour brought port visits to Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Glasgow, Scotland, as well as training exercises with NATO forces in the northern Atlantic.

The first four years of the 1950s established the pattern for the remainder of &quot;Tusk&quot;&#x27;s Navy career. She saw four additional Mediterranean deployments between 1954 and 1973. Initially, however, a long stretch of East Coast operations intervened between overseas deployments. Six years elapsed between her 1954 northern Europe assignment and her second Mediterranean cruise late in 1960. The fall of 1961 brought another round of NATO exercises followed by joint American-Canadian training operations in the western Atlantic. Another three-year period of New London-based local operations occurred before she was deployed again to Europe in the fall of 1964 for more NATO training. During the spring and summer of 1966, &quot;Tusk&quot; returned to the Mediterranean for her third tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet. Late 1966 brought a resumption of duty in American coastal waters which lasted until early 1967. During the summer of 1967, the submarine returned to northern European waters, visiting several ports and participating in yet another series of multinational NATO exercises. That November, she joined in binational American-Canadian exercises in the western Atlantic before resuming her East Coast routine. Throughout 1968 and during the first half of 1969, the ship continued New London based operations, including services to nuclear-powered submarines and . In July, she made her fourth deployment to the Mediterranean, returning to East Coast operations in October.

== Decommissioning and transfer ==

After almost three years of that New London-based routine, including an overhaul at the Charleston Navy Yard from July to December 1971, &quot;Tusk&quot; set out for her fifth and final tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet. She concluded that cruise the following October. The submarine rounded out the final year of her career with normal operations along the eastern seaboard, primarily in the New England vicinity. On 18 October 1973, &quot;Tusk&quot; was decommissioned at New London, Connecticut, struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and on 18 October 1973 transferred, by sale, to the Republic of China (Taiwan).

Ex-&quot;Tusk&quot; was commissioned into the Republic of China Navy as &quot;Hai Pao&quot; (meaning &quot;seal&quot;), first with hull number SS-92, then SS-794, and finally SS-792. The terms of the purchase specified that she be used strictly for ASW training, so her torpedo tubes were welded shut before the transfer. The Taiwanese restored the torpedo tubes in 1976 and reportedly received modern torpedoes through Italy from a number of sources. The boat is reportedly allowed only to operate in sea shallower than 100m.

<text>USS &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; (SS-425), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for trumpetfish, any of several fishes so-called for their deep, compressed body and long, tubular snout. Her keel was laid down on 23 August 1943 at Philadelphia by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company. She was launched on 13 May 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Oswald S. Colclough, and commissioned on 29 January 1946.

&quot;Trumpetfish&quot; and are erroneously listed with the &quot;Tench&quot; class in some sources, as their hull numbers are in the sequence assigned to that class.

==Pacific Fleet service==

A combined shakedown and goodwill cruise to ports in the Caribbean Sea in the early spring of 1946 preceded the submarine&#x27;s westward cruise to Pearl Harbor. Highlighting the ship&#x27;s training operations in Hawaiian waters was her intentional torpedoing of the large s which had been captured at the end of World War II.

==Atlantic Fleet service==

&quot;Trumpetfish&quot; returned to the East Coast for local operations out of New London, Connecticut, and, late in 1946, was briefly based at Annapolis to conduct training cruises for United States Naval Academy midshipmen. In the summer of 1947, as the ship underwent a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) conversion, her hull was streamlined, a snorkel system was added, and higher capacity batteries were installed. The net result of the conversion enhanced the ship&#x27;s offensive capabilities and increased her maximum submerged speed.

Attached to Submarine Squadron 4, based at Key West, Florida, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; conducted local operations and training exercises off the East Coast. In September 1953, she participated in NATO Exercise &quot;Mariner&quot; and then was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea with the Sixth Fleet.

After returning home, the ship operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean through 1955. Following duties out of Key West in January and February 1956, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; proceeded to Guantanamo Bay for service with the Fleet Training Group. In July, the ship took part in midshipmen training cruises from Annapolis, Maryland, to Guantanamo Bay and back.

In the fall of 1956, the ship joined a hunter-killer group for a deployment to Europe and the Middle East. Departing Norfolk on 1 October 1956, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; sailed for European waters and participated in training exercises as she crossed the Atlantic. After calling at Brest, France, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; suddenly received word of a crisis in the Levant.

==Middle East deployment==

President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser had nationalized the previously British-owned Suez Canal, and prevailing Arab-Israeli tensions had erupted into warfare while British and French troops attacked Egyptian positions. &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; made her best speed for Suda Bay and joined the Sixth Fleet in peace-keeping missions in the eastern Mediterranean. With the cessation of hostilities, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; resumed her Mediterranean cruise operating briefly with the Italian fleet before returning to Key West on 28 January 1957.

The submarine conducted local operations out of her home port until 29 August, when she got underway for European waters and fall NATO exercises. Air, surface, and submarine forces of NATO nations engaged in tests and exercises to hone their capabilities to defend the NATO nations against possible aggression. After returning to Key West on 25 October, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; operated out of that base conducting training and exercises into 1959.

During her next Mediterranean deployment, she snorkeled through the Strait of Bonifacio between Corsica and Sardinia. In August 1959, as part of Atlantic Fleet dispersal plans, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot;’s home port was changed to Charleston, South Carolina. During January and February 1960, the submarine took part in operations in the North Atlantic before briefly visiting Scotland. She subsequently participated in exercises in the western Atlantic Ocean, before a major refit at Charleston during 1961 modernized the ship to a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) III configuration. The alterations increased her capabilities by adding to her length, by giving her better weapons and electronics, and by extending her range.

==Cuban Missile Crisis==

&quot;Trumpetfish&quot; resumed a schedule of local antisubmarine warfare operations out of Charleston, alternating deployments to the Mediterranean and duty with the Sixth Fleet. She participated in emergency operations during the tension precipitated by the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. The submarine later participated in several inter-type fleet exercises in home waters and in the Caribbean. &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; underwent a routine yard period at Charleston before taking part in Exercises &quot;Plumb Bob I&quot; and &quot;Minibox&quot; in 1965. After a Mediterranean deployment in early 1966, the ship took part in &quot;Plumb Bob II&quot; and provided services for the David Taylor Model Basin.

==Post Cuban Missile Crisis==

Subsequently, assigned the primary mission of providing services for antisubmarine warfare forces, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; stood ready to conduct mining and reconnaissance missions as well. On 12 January 1970, the submarine departed Charleston for Cape Kennedy, provided services en route to submarine , and conducted type training exercises. A port visit to Cape Kennedy occupied 16 January to 18 January, before the submarine got underway for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to provide services for the Naval Ordnance Laboratory Test Facility (NOLTF) there. Ten days of local operations at the NOLTF preceded the ship&#x27;s providing services for during the nuclear ballistic missile submarine&#x27;s sea trials off the Florida coast from 6 February to 8 February. Subsequently, taking part in Operations &quot;Springboard&quot; and &quot;Exotic Dancer III,&quot; &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; headed for Philadelphia, and a yard overhaul which would last through the summer and fall and into December 1970.

After the long overhaul, the submarine participated in type and refresher training off the East Coast before she headed for the Caribbean in the spring. Among her activities were those which provided services for the Federal Republic of Germany&#x27;s destroyer between 7 May and 14 May. The exchange of several crew members with the Bundesmarine ship during this time provided a valuable and enlightening experience.

On 5 June, after participating in a fleet naval mine test, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; commenced six weeks of pre-deployment upkeep, with sea trials from 12 July to 16 July. On 23 July, the submarine departed for South American waters and Operation &quot;Unites XII.&quot; Joining Task Force (TF) 86, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; arrived at Cartagena, Colombia, on 6 August, prior to transiting the Panama Canal to proceed down the Pacific coast of South America. She crossed the equator on 20 August and made port at Callao, Peru, on 30 August. The ship operated with TF 86 for two weeks after the four-day port visit at Callao, before arriving at Valparaíso, Chile, on 17 September.

The submarine traversed the inland waterway and the Strait of Magellan and arrived at Punta Arenas, Chile, on 4 October. She conducted operations during &quot;Unites XII&quot; off the Atlantic coast of South America, with visits to March Del Plata, Argentina, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before rejoining TF 86 at La Guaira, Venezuela, on 2 December. Bidding farewell to the task force four days later, the ship sailed for Charleston and arrived at her home port on 17 December 1971.

&quot;Trumpetfish&quot; remained with SubRon 4, operating out of Charleston through 1972. She deployed to the Caribbean again on 25 January 1973. Later conducting torpedo tests off Newport, Rhode Island, the submarine operated with British aircraft carrier off San Juan, Puerto Rico, in May, before returning to Charleston on 30 January. Upkeep, type training, and services for Patrol Wing 11 in the Jacksonville, Florida, area preceded the ship&#x27;s arrival at Charleston on 15 August to prepare for decommissioning.

==Transfer to Brazilian Navy==

On 15 October 1973, at Charleston, &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; was decommissioned, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and turned over to the Brazilian government.

She was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Goias&quot; (S-15) (named for Goias, the Brazilian state) with Commander Edouardo Russo her first commanding officer. &quot;Goias&quot; was deleted from the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; on 16 April 1990.

<doc id="1058358" wikidata="Q7121806" url="?curid=1058358" title="Pablum">
<text>Pablum is a processed cereal for infants originally marketed and co-created by the Mead Johnson &amp; Company in 1931. The product was developed at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto to combat infant malnutrition.

Developers of Pablum included Canadian pediatricians Frederick Tisdall, Theodore Drake, Pearl Summerfeldt, Alan Brown, laboratory technician Ruth Herbert (all of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto), and Mead Johnson chemist Harry H. Engel.
== Name ==
The trademarked name is a contracted form of the Latin word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;foodstuff&quot;. The word &quot;pablum&quot; had long been used in botany and medicine to refer to nutrition or substances of which the nutritive elements are passively absorbed. In a broader sense, &quot;pablum&quot; can refer to something that is simplistic, bland, mushy, unappetizing, or infantile.
== Description ==
Pablum Mixed Cereal was made from a mixture of ground and precooked wheat (farina), oatmeal, yellow corn meal, bone meal, dried brewer&#x27;s yeast, and powdered alfalfa leaf, fortified with reduced iron – providing an assortment of minerals and vitamins A, B1, B2, D, and E. Pablum is palatable and easily digested without causing side effects like diarrhea or constipation. It does not contain common allergens such as chicken eggs, lactose or nuts of any kind, while it does contain wheat and corn, which can be allergenic for some.

Goods and Services

&#x27;Specially prepared cereal food consists of a mixture of wheat meal, oatmeal, and yellow corn meal. To this mixture, wheat embryo, dried yeast, powdered dehydrated alfalfa leaf, and powdered beef bone have been added for human use.&#x27;

== History ==

Pablum was developed in 1930 by Canadian pediatricians Frederick Tisdall, Theodore Drake, and Alan Brown, in collaboration with nutrition laboratory technician Ruth Herbert (all of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto), along with Mead Johnson chemist Harry H. Engel. At the time, breast-feeding had declined in the middle and upper classes, with the effect that the diets of babies were often deficient in essential elements. The cereal marked a breakthrough in nutritional science: it helped prevent rickets, a crippling childhood disease, by ensuring that children had sufficient vitamin D in their diet. From the bone meal, it had about 12 ppm fluorine, which works out to about what pediatricians were prescribing about four decades later.

Although neither Pablum nor its biscuit predecessor was the first food designed and sold specifically for babies, it was the first baby food to come precooked and thoroughly dried. The ease of preparation made Pablum successful in an era when infant malnutrition was still a major problem in industrialized countries. 

For a period of 25 years, the Hospital for Sick Children and the Toronto Pediatric Foundation received a royalty payment on every package of Pablum sold. In 2005, the Pablum brand was acquired by the H. J. Heinz Company.

<doc id="1058364" wikidata="Q2195304" url="?curid=1058364" title="Manningtree">
<text>Manningtree is a town and civil parish in the Tendring district of Essex, England, which lies on the River Stour. It is part of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==Smallest town claim==
Manningtree has traditionally claimed to be the smallest town in England, but its 2007 population of 700 people in 20 hectares and the 2011 census population for the civil parish of 900 are much higher than the 351 population of Fordwich, Kent. However, it is believed to be the smallest town by area.

In April 2009 it was proposed that Manningtree should merge with Mistley and Lawford to form a single parish, losing its separate identity as a town. As of 2023 such a merger has not occurred.

==History==

The name Manningtree is thought to derive from &#x27;many trees&#x27;.
The town grew around the wool trade from the 15th century until its decline in the 18th century and also had a thriving shipping trade in corn, timber and coal until this declined with the coming of the railway. Manningtree is known as the centre of the activities of Matthew Hopkins, the self-appointed Witchfinder General, who claimed to have overheard local women discussing their meetings with the devil in 1644 with his accusations leading to their execution as witches.

Many of the buildings in the centre of the town have Georgian facades which obscure their earlier origins. Notable buildings include Manningtree Library, which was originally built as &#x27;a public hall for the purposes of corn exchange&#x27; and was later used around 1900 for public entertainment, and the Methodist church located on South Street, completed in 1807.

&quot;The Ascension&quot;, by John Constable, which now hangs in Dedham church, was commissioned in 1821 for the altarpiece of the early seventeenth-century church on the High Street, demolished in 1967.

==Governance==
Manningtree is part of the electoral ward called Lawford, Manningtree and Mistley. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,603.

==Geography==

Manningtree is on Holbrook Bay, part of the River Stour in the north of Essex. It is the eastern edge of Dedham Vale.

Nearby villages include Dedham, Mistley, Lawford, Wrabness and Brantham.

==Transport==

Manningtree railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line and provides regular, direct services to London, Norwich and Harwich. The station is actually located in the Parish of Lawford.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sudbury TV transmitter. 

The town is served by both BBC Essex and BBC Radio Suffolk. Other radio stations including Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio Essex, and Actual Radio.

Harwich and Manningtree Standard is the town&#x27;s local newspaper which publishes on Fridays. 

== In fiction ==
Manningtree features in Ronald Bassett&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; and in A. K. Blakemore&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;The Manningtree Witches&quot;.

In Shakespeare’s Henry IV Part I (Act 2 Scene 4), Flastaff is referred to as “that roasted Manningtree ox“. This was marked in 2000 with a sculpture of an ox in the town centre.

A. K. Blakemore&#x27;s 2021 novel, &quot;The Manningtree Witches&quot;, is set in the town. The novel won the Desmond Elliott Prize 2021, being described by the judges as &quot;a stunning achievement.&quot;

==Notable people==
*Margaret Thatcher lived and worked in Manningtree and worked for BX Plastics
*Matthew Hopkins, the self-styled Witch-Finder General, lived in Manningtree
*Henry Patten, the 2024 Gentlemen&#x27;s Wimbledon doubles champion lived in Manningtree.

==Twin town==
Manningtree is twinned with Frankenberg, Hesse, Germany.

<doc id="1058370" wikidata="Q5496610" url="?curid=1058370" title="Fred Young (Ontario politician)">
<text>Fred Matthews Young (14 February 1907 – 13 December 1993) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1963 to 1981 who represented the riding of Yorkview. He was an ordained minister and long time organizer for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).

==Background==
Young was born in Long Reach, New Brunswick, near the port city of Saint John, in 1907. He attended Teachers College in Fredericton, New Brunswick and taught school in Woodstock, New Brunswick. Later on, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Allison University. He attended the University of Toronto and received both a Master of Arts and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in divinity. He served as a minister in the United Church of Canada, in both Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island from 1934 until 1940. He and his wife Winnifred raise two children, a boy and a girl.

==Politics==
After World War II, Young worked, as an organizer for the CCF in the Maritimes, being personally recruited by the CCF&#x27;s national secretary, David Lewis. Though, officially, he was a staff representative for the United Steel Workers of America, he was co-opted by the party. He travelled throughout Atlantic Canada and Ontario mostly doing work for the party. In May 1951, the Ontario CCF hired him, at the urging of Donald C. MacDonald, then the CCF&#x27;s national organizer, who persuade Young to relocate from the Maritimes. He became the Ontario party&#x27;s full-time organizer.

In 1953, he ran for the leadership of the Ontario CCF, losing by six votes to Donald C. MacDonald in the CCF leadership convention. After five unsuccessful attempts to gain a public office, he won election to the town council of North York, Ontario in 1955. He served as deputy reeve and chair of the executive committee.

He attempted on several occasions to win a seat for the CCF and its successor, the New Democratic Party (NDP) either at the federal or provincial level. He finally won election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1963 provincial election for the North York riding of Yorkview. Young sat as an Ontario New Democratic Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) from 1963 until 1981.

He was a friend of consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Both Nader and Young, as a legislator, fought for highway safety and mandatory use of seat belts. He was also an early advocate of airbags. In 1975, the Ontario government enacted the mandatory seatbelt reforms that he was advocating for years. As a legislator, Young became one of the first MPPs to open a community office to help his riding constituents. He was also responsible for writing the daily prayer used in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario throughout the later half of the 20th century.

==Later life==
Following his career in politics, the City of North York honoured him by naming a small park adjacent to York University after him in 1990. Young was hospitalized for many weeks at the York-Finch General Hospital before his death on Monday, 13 December 1993.

<doc id="1058374" wikidata="Q7873196" url="?curid=1058374" title="USS Quillback">
<text>USS &quot;Quillback&quot; (SS-424), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for quillback, a fish of the sucker family, widespread in the freshwaters of North America and Northern Asia.

==Construction==
When her construction by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, was authorized, her name was to be &quot;Trembler&quot;, which would have made her the first ship named for the trembler, a torpedinoid fish of the West Indies and Brazil, but she was given a less embarrassing name on 7 December 1943.

Her keel was laid down on 27 June 1944. She was launched on 1 October 1944 sponsored by Mrs. J. A. Tyree, Jr., and commissioned on 29 December 1944.

==Wartime activities==
After training at New London, Connecticut, and work on an experimental ordnance project at Key West, Florida, &quot;Quillback&quot; departed for Pearl Harbor and her maiden war patrol, off the coast of Kyūshū. During this patrol, from 30 May to 24 July 1945, she destroyed a Japanese suicide motorboat and rescued one aviator from the water only a half mile from the heavily armed shore. Surrender of the enemy found &quot;Quillback&quot; refitting for her second patrol at Guam.

==Training activities==
Peacetime duties returned &quot;Quillback&quot; to New London for duty as a unit of Submarine Squadron 2. From 1945 to 1951, she operated with the Submarine School in a training capacity and as an experimental unit of the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory. In April 1951, &quot;Quillback&quot; departed New London for a six-month tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. In April 1952, she reported to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for decommissioning and conversion.

On 27 February 1953, &quot;Quillback&quot; was recommissioned and joined the Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet as a streamlined Greater Underwater Propulsive Power Program (GUPPY) Submarine. She reported to ComSubRon 4 at Key West. There in local operations, with occasional trips to Guantanamo Bay, she assisted the Fleet Training Group in Destroyer ASW indoctrination. In 1956, 1957, and 1958, &quot;Quillback&quot; took part in major fleet and NATO exercises in the North Atlantic.

==Mediterranean deployment==
In 1959, &quot;Quillback&quot; was transferred to Submarine Squadron 12. In June 1959, the Quillback sailed the St. Lawrence River, traversed locks, and navigated all of the Great Lakes to reach Chicago in Operation Inland Seas to mark the official opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. During 1960, she underwent extensive overhaul at Charleston, South Carolina, to improve her offensive capabilities. She deployed to the Mediterranean in October 1961, returning to Key West in February 1962. Operating locally out of Key West from May to October, &quot;Quillback&quot; was deployed to Guantanamo Bay when the Cuban Quarantine was put into effect and remained there during the first ten days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. During 1963, &quot;Quillback&quot; operated out of Key West and rendered services to the Fleet Training Group at Guantanamo.

&quot;Quillback&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean for six months in July 1964. Experimental torpedo research and development projects were assigned to &quot;Quillback&quot; in 1965 until she deployed to Guantanamo Bay in June. She continued to operate out of Key West until deploying to the Mediterranean again from August to November 1967. She spent most of 1968 and 1969 in the Caribbean.

:&quot;[1970-1973]&quot;

Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 March 1973, &quot;Quillback&quot; was sold on 21 March 1974.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Quillback&quot; earned one battle star for World War II service.

<text>Callaïs is the generic name for ancient green-blue precious stones used for making pendants and beads by western European cultures of the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age. The term includes turquoise and variscite but not jade. &quot;Callaïs&quot; was described by Pliny the Elder as being paler than lapis lazuli. Callaïs objects have been found in Neolithic tombs from the mid-5th millennium BC in the Carnac region of western France.

Callaïs deposits are thought to have been widely distributed throughout the Iberian peninsula, and transported from Andalusia, Castile, and Catalonia to Brittany, Normandy, and the Paris Basin.

<text>USS &quot;Toro&quot; (SS-422), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the &quot;toro&quot;, a name applied to various fish including the cowfish, the catalufa, and the cavallo. 

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Toro&quot;′s keel was laid down on 27 May 1944 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 23 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Alan G. Kirk, and commissioned on 8 December 1944.

==First War Patrol==

Following her completion on 26 December 1944, &quot;Toro&quot; participated in training exercises out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Newport, Rhode Island, and New London, Connecticut, before arriving at Key West, Florida, on 11 February 1945. She provided services to the Fleet Sonar School, then, on 28 February, departed Key West in company with submarine , bound for the Panama Canal Zone where she underwent a week of intensive training. The two submarines set a westward course for Hawaii on 15 March and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 April. &quot;Toro&quot; conducted training exercises out of that port with Submarine Division 101 until 24 April when she departed Oahu in company with submarine . She arrived at Saipan on 6 May and, after one false start, got underway for her first war patrol on 10 May.

After arriving in her patrol and lifeguard area south of Shikoku and east of Kyūshū on 16 May, she occasionally encountered Japanese planes as she pursued her duties. On 18 May, following a probable periscope sighting, &quot;Toro&quot; detected a transmission on Japanese submarine radar frequency and attempted to close the contact but was unsuccessful.

As she patrolled Bungo Suido, she was often assigned as lifeguard for air strikes against the Japanese islands. While off Omino Shima before sunrise on 25 May, she received word that a B-29 Superfortress was in trouble. She began the search in state four seas with only fair visibility and, two hours after dawn, homed in by friendly air cover, she rescued two Army aviators who had been floating in their lifejackets for three and one-half hours. Twenty minutes later, she rescued another aviator and then continued her search for additional survivors until late in the day. The names of the three airmen were Charles Smith, Howard Stein, and Robert Canova. While patrolling on the surface on the following morning, she made radar contact with a possible target at . The submarine turned toward the contact and shortly thereafter a torpedo wake crossed her bow, indicating that an enemy vessel had first located her. &quot;Toro&quot; dove and had no further contact with the unseen attacker. &quot;Toro&quot; continued patrols and lifeguard duty in Bungo Suido until 14 June when she set her course for the Mariana Islands. She moored at Apra Harbor five days later.

==Second War Patrol==

Following refit by submarine tender , &quot;Toro&quot; got underway from Guam on 14 July; paused briefly at Saipan for fuel, water, and the replacement of her torpedoes with Mark 18s; and arrived in her patrol area south of Shikoku on 24 July. Late in the day, she was drawn far out of her assigned area in a fruitless search for a downed flier. The departure of &quot;Toro&quot;’s air cover at 18:00 left her in a most dangerous situation due to the expected passage of an American task force on an antishipping sweep. Unable to clear the area in time, &quot;Toro&quot; made radar contact with the task force at 20:55. Despite attempts to establish her identity, &quot;Toro&quot; was soon the target of two obviously unfriendly American ships which bore down on her at a speed of . The destroyer opened gunfire and bracketed &quot;Toro&quot; with her first salvo at a distance of . &quot;Toro&quot; crash-dived and attempted to establish her identity using a flare, smoke bombs, and sonar, but the ships were still firing when she passed . She continued down to and rigged for depth charges. The surface vessels, thinking that &quot;Colahan&quot; had sunk a Japanese picket boat, remained in the area for half an hour searching for survivors without discovering that their target had been a friendly submarine. At 01:00 on 25 July, &quot;Toro&quot; surfaced and set her course back to her patrol area.

That morning, she returned to her lifeguard station and, in the afternoon, rescued three British aviators afloat on a raft. She maintained her station for carrier strikes against Japan on 28 July and, shortly after noon on 30 July, received a distress message from a United States Army Air Corps P-51 Mustang plane. After circling his plane over the submarine the pilot parachuted from the crippled aircraft at an altitude of only . Within seven minutes, &quot;Toro&quot;’s crew brought the aviator on board.

She transferred the rescued British fliers to submarine 
 on 1 August. On 5 August, while patrolling her lifeguard area for planes returning from bomber raids on the Japanese islands, &quot;Toro&quot; sighted dense black smoke on the horizon and, receiving reports of a downed pilot in the area, put on all possible speed to investigate the source of the smoke. Less than 20 minutes later, she picked up an Army aviator afloat in his lifeboat impressively marked by a smoke display. Minutes later, a second Army aviator jumped from his plane nearby, and again &quot;Toro&quot; had a flier on board within seven minutes of the time his parachute opened.

==Post-World War II service==

At mid-month, Japan capitulated. After destroying a number of naval mines south of Honshū, the submarine departed the area on 17 August and proceeded via Guam to Midway Island where she arrived on 27 August.

On 4 September, she departed Midway and proceeded via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal to east coast ports. She arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 31 October to prepare for inactivation. In January 1946, the rescue tug &quot;ATR-67&quot; towed the submarine to Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London, where on 7 February 1946, &quot;Toro&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve.

&quot;Toro&quot; was recommissioned on 13 May 1947, and she reported for duty to Submarine Squadron 2, Atlantic Fleet, on 28 May. She conducted hunter/killer exercises, made a simulated war patrol in the Arctic Sea, and joined fleet tactical exercises in the Mediterranean Sea.

On 28 November 1947, &quot;Toro&quot; sunk, as a target, the captured German submarine &quot;U-530&quot; with a torpedo. In July 1945, after the surrender of Nazi Germany, the crew of the U-530 were interned when it surrendered in Argentina. The crew and the boat were then transferred to the United States.

On 28 January 1950, &quot;Toro&quot; joined Submarine Development Group 2, and her operations helped to refine submarine tactics, weapons, and equipment. She worked in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea until July 1952, when she reported to Submarine Squadron 2 at New London and assumed new duties training submariners. During the next ten years, she combined these activities with type training and services to ships and aircraft engaged in antisubmarine warfare exercises. She also participated in Operation Springboard and made one Mediterranean cruise. She was redesignated an auxiliary submarine with hull classification symbol AGSS in July 1962 and, on 22 November 1962, as her Navy career drew to its close, she made her 11,000th dive while operating in Long Island Sound.

In February 1963, she was ordered to berth with the Philadelphia Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, for demilitarization and non-industrial stripping; on 11 March 1963 she was decommissioned, and on 1 April 1963 her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. 

===USS &quot;Thresher&quot; role===
She was slated to be sunk near the lost submarine in an attempt to understand the currents near the wreck location but the plan was abandoned, and &quot;Toro&quot; was later sold and scrapped. Her name plate is on display at the Freedom Park.

<text>USS &quot;Trutta&quot; (SS-421), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the trutta, a variety of trout, distinguished from the typical trout by its small, black spots and its smaller and fewer scales. She was originally assigned the name &quot;Tomtate&quot;, often misspelled as &quot;Tomatate&quot;, and would have made her the only ship named for the tomtate, a food fish of warm American waters having a compressed body, a toothless palate, and conical jaw teeth, but was renamed &quot;Trutta&quot; on 24 September 1942. Her keel was laid down on 22 May 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 18 August 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Edward C. Magdeburger, and commissioned on 16 November 1944 with Commander Arthur C. Smith in command.

==First War Patrol==

Following outfitting and shakedown, &quot;Trutta&quot; underwent 30 days of intensive training in the Portsmouth-New London area and then set a course southward and steamed via the Canal Zone to arrive at Pearl Harbor on 25 February 1945. After a period of advanced training, &quot;Trutta&quot; got underway from Oahu with and , members of a coordinated attack group under &quot;Trutta&quot;&#x27;s direction and arrived at Saipan on 30 March. The following day, as she was leaving Tanapag Harbor on her first war patrol, the submarine struck a cable connected to an oil drum adrift in the charted channel and was forced to return to Saipan to repair her damaged propeller blades. The submarine finally got underway on 3 April and proceeded as rapidly as possible toward her patrol area.

On 7 April, she changed course in an attempt to intercept a Japanese naval force which had sortied from Bungo Suido late the day before. It was feared that this task force, headed by &quot;Yamato&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest battleship, would interrupt the assault on Okinawa to the south. Despite her full-power running, &quot;Trutta&quot; did not intercept the Japanese ships because they changed their course. Nevertheless, the Japanese force did not reach Okinawa because on that day fliers from the carriers of Vice Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s Task Force 58 sank &quot;Yamato&quot;, light cruiser &quot;Yahagi&quot;, and destroyer &quot;Hamakaze&quot;, and inflicted irremediable damage to three other destroyers which the Japanese scuttled. After receiving news of this successful battle, &quot;Trutta&quot; headed southward on 9 April. Proceeding via the Nansei Shoto, she avoided the hostile notice of enemy aircraft and weathered gale-force winds and force-five seas before entering her patrol area in the East China Sea on the afternoon of 11 April. There, she patrolled along the Shanghai-Quelpart Island traffic routes. On 13 April, while pursuing an antisubmarine force of three Japanese destroyers, she passed through an uncharted minefield before the ships changed course and outdistanced her.

While patrolling near the entrance to Daito Wan on the western coast of Korea on 18 April, she sank one small freighter with gunfire and damaged another. Off the China coast on 22 April, &quot;Trutta&quot; narrowly escaped damage when an enemy float plane dropped two bombs which exploded over the diving submarine. Shortly after midnight three days later, as &quot;Trutta&quot; patrolled west of Quelpart Island, lookouts on the submarine&#x27;s bridge were startled to see a torpedo pass astern. As &quot;Trutta&quot; put on speed and turned parallel to the torpedo&#x27;s wake, another torpedo passed by her port side moving from stern to bow, a sinister reminder that she was not alone in the Yellow Sea. Fortunately, &quot;Trutta&quot; observed no further sign of the Japanese submarine, and she continued her patrols until 26 April when she headed for Guam.

Late in the day, on 27 April, as she passed between Akuseki Shima and Takara Shima in the northern Ryukyus, she made contact with a Japanese plane. The harbinger of a prolonged coordinated holddown attempt. The next morning, finding her adversary of the night before replaced by two &quot;Settles,&quot; the submarine, low on air and battery power, sent a message indicating that she would have to surface and fight it out if the situation did not improve before noon. A little more than an hour later, 10 American fighters from Okinawa appeared and routed the Japanese planes. Friendly air cover remained with the submarine until she recharged her batteries and filled her air flasks. She then proceeded independently to the Marianas, arriving at Guam on 4 May.

==Second War Patrol==

Following refitting and exercises with battleship , &quot;Trutta&quot; got underway on 2 June in company with . She weathered a typhoon before arriving on lifeguard station on 7 June. That day, while standing lifeguard duty for air strikes on Kobe, the submarine rescued a downed Army aviator who had been adrift in a small rubber boat for nearly a week and, the day before, had also weathered the typhoon.

As air raids against the cities of the Japanese homeland intensified, &quot;Trutta&quot; manned a lifeguard station south of Kyushu, made patrols just off Bungo Suido, and conducted visual and photo reconnaissance of Tori Shima, approaching to within about one mile (1.6 km) of the island. On 21 June, she departed Bungo Suido to join a coordinated attack group (wolfpack) &quot;Street&#x27;s Sweepers&quot; patrolling the Yellow and East China Seas. She conducted patrols west of Tsushima Strait and then fired a few diversionary rounds of five-inch (127 mm) fire on Hiradoshima before moving west to take up patrol along the southwest coast of Korea. On 1 July, her persistence paid off when, after pursuing a sailing vessel, she discovered a fleet of schooners. Working quickly to take advantage of surprise and to prevent the ships from fleeing to nearby shallow water, &quot;Trutta&quot; sank seven of the three- and four-masted schooners in a four-hour action. Crew members boarded and searched two of the vessels and put the schooner crews in lifeboats before destroying the ships.

On 6 July, while patrolling the southern approaches to Daito Wan, she came upon a tug towing three schooners, quickly dispatched the tug and two of its tows with five-inch (127 mm) fire, and left the third in flames. She continued patrolling along the Korean coast until the afternoon of 12 July when she departed the area and set her course for the Marianas.

==End of hostilities==

She arrived at Guam on 18 July, underwent refitting by , and then got underway on 12 August for her third patrol. Before &quot;Trutta&quot; arrived in her assigned area, she received official word that peace negotiations had obviated continuing her patrol; the submarine set a northeast course. She arrived at Midway on 24 August and two days later headed home via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal. After calls at New Orleans and other gulf and east-coast ports, she arrived at New London early in January 1946 and reported to the Sixth Fleet for inactivation. By March 1946, she had been placed out of commission. She remained in the Reserve Fleet until 1951 when she was reactivated at New London. Recommissioned in March 1951, she operated out of that port until 4 May 1952 when she was again decommissioned, this time at Charleston. Following conversion to a &quot;Guppy II A&quot; submarine, she was recommissioned on 2 January 1953 and joined Submarine Squadron 4 at Key West.

==Post World War II U.S. service==

For the next 19 years, she operated out of Key West, plying the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. During this period, she also made six deployments to the Mediterranean. She assisted in the evaluation of new weapon systems, including electronic counter-measure equipment; served as an antisubmarine warfare training target; trained naval reserves; and participated in fleet exercises. Shortly after her transfer to Squadron 12 on 1 August 1959, she rescued five Cuban refugees who had been adrift in a rubber boat for two days. Still homeported at Key West, she continued her duties through the 1960s, breaking routine with goodwill visits to American and Mediterranean ports, and earning a number of Battle Efficiency &quot;E&#x27;s.&quot; Moored at Key West in November 1969, she celebrated the 25th anniversary of her first commissioning.

==Transfer to Turkish Navy==

Her long career with the United States Navy drew to its close in 1972. In June of that year, she trained a turnover crew of the Turkish Navy, and the veteran submarine was decommissioned on 1 July and turned over to the Navy of the Republic of Turkey. She was renamed TCG &quot;Cerbe&quot; (S 340) (the Turkish name of the island of Djerba, in reference to the 1560 Battle of Djerba). &quot;Trutta&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on that same day.

The Turkish Navy decommissioned &quot;Cerbe&quot; on 23 July 1999 at the Gölcük Navy Yard. Today, her sail is preserved as a memorial to Turkish submariners.

&quot;Trutta&quot; received two battle stars for World War II service.

<text>USS &quot;Tigrone&quot; (SS/SSR/AGSS-419), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tigrone, a tiger shark found in tropical waters. Her keel was laid down on 8 May 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 20 July 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Mary B. Grisham (née Breault), wife of Captain Charles F. Grisham, USN, Superintendent of the Portsmouth, N.H., Navy Yard, and commissioned on 25 October 1944.

&quot;Tigrone&quot; completed fitting out in mid-November and conducted training out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, before departing the Submarine Base at New London on the last day of 1944. After ten days of training at the Fleet Sound School, the new submarine got underway on 16 January. Steaming via the Canal Zone, she paused for a week of training off Panama, then set her course for Hawaii, conducting extensive practice approach exercises with attack transport en route. On 16 February, she arrived at Pearl Harbor to prepare for her first war patrol.

On 9 March, she departed Oahu and steamed westward, arriving at Guam on 19 March. After a three-day pause to repair a main engine, she got underway on 21 March in company with submarines
 and , members of a combined attack group, led by her own commanding officer, Commander Hiram Cassedy. Joined by , the submarines set their course for the South China Sea where they formed a scouting line in hopes of intercepting Japanese shipping.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; was mistakenly strafed and bombed by a B-24 Liberator on 24 March. &quot;Tigrone&quot;’s first brush with the enemy came on 29 March in the South China Sea when she dove to avoid an enemy
&quot;Oscar&quot;
and, at 60 ft (18 m), felt the jolt of a small explosion over the forward battery compartment, apparently the concussion of a small bomb dropped by the enemy plane. The new submarine emerged from this encounter without damage and continued her patrol of the sea lanes off the China coast.

In the days that followed, she made an unsuccessful attempt to intercept a convoy spotted by American planes. Then, on 3 April, she began lifeguard duties off the eastern shore of Hainan. On 5 April, &quot;Tigrone&quot; again managed to evade a bomb dropped by a high-flying Japanese plane. On 8 April, she assumed a lifeguard station off Kuannan and began steering five mile (8 km) legs to maintain her station, when the ship&#x27;s commanding officer noted a wake which he took to be one of the ship&#x27;s own. Two minutes later, the appearance of a torpedo away on the port bow gave startling proof that the wake was that of an enemy submarine. As &quot;Tigrone&quot; swung left, the torpedo passed her abeam, less than away. She then submerged and rigged for silent running, remaining below for over two hours.

On 9 April, she took up a lifeguard station off Mofu Point and continued patrols off Hainan until 15 April when she departed the area late in the day. She bombarded Pratas Reef near Pratas Island with five-inch (127 mm) gunfire on 16 April and joined submarine three days later to fire on targets including towns and docks on Batan Island. She ended her first war patrol at Guam on 24 April 1945.

== Second patrol ==

After refitting by submarine tender , &quot;Tigrone&quot; departed Apra Harbor on 19 May, took on torpedoes at Saipan the same day, and on 20 May got underway for her assigned area. On 25 May, she sighted Sofu Gan Island and Tori Shima before taking up her lifeguard station south of Honshū and west of the Nanpō Islands. That same day, she rescued a downed flier from the 19th Fighter Command, Iwo Jima.

Early on the morning of 27 May, &quot;Tigrone&quot; engaged a Japanese lugger which countered the submarine&#x27;s five-inch (127 mm) and 40 millimeter fire with machine-gun fire. As &quot;Tigrone&quot; turned away from the raking fire of the lugger, heavy seas washed over her main deck, knocking three of the submarine&#x27;s crewmen against the gun and injuring them. Despite intermittent heavy rain, &quot;Tigrone&quot; finished off the lugger with five-inch (127 mm) fire. The final and telling round caught the lugger dead center, set it afire, and stopped it dead in the water. High seas made boarding a hazardous proposition, so the battered enemy vessel was left to burn, and &quot;Tigrone&quot; returned to her lifeguard station.

Early on the afternoon of 28 May, the submarine rendezvoused with a Navy bomber which had signaled its distress. The plane ditched from &quot;Tigrone&quot;, and the submarine&#x27;s crew quickly rescued five survivors from the water. In the next two days, &quot;Tigrone&quot; proved her skill as a lifeguard ship as she responded to frequent calls for aid and rescued 23 men from the Philippine Sea. On the afternoon of 24 May, &quot;Tigrone&quot; answered a call for assistance from a severely damaged PBY Catalina seaplane which had nosed into a wave on takeoff from a rescue operation. Quickly arriving on the scene, the submarine took on board 16 survivors, the crew and twice-rescued passengers of the disabled seaplane.

Soon the submarine was searching again, this time for survivors of other downed aircraft who had been reported by circling planes to be floating on rafts in &quot;Tigrone&quot;’s lifeguard area. Night fell before the submarine located the rafts, but, early on 30 May, she surfaced and, despite 30 ft (9 m) waves, resumed the search. Friendly aircraft aided her efforts, and &quot;Tigrone&quot;’s persistence was rewarded when she at last located seven Army aviators afloat on a raft. These tenacious survivors had been washed overboard several times during the night but had climbed back each time. The heavy seas made rescue difficult and time-consuming, but finally the exhausted aviators were brought safely on board the
submarine. &quot;Tigrone&quot; jauntily sent out the message,

and noted that she had set a new record for lifeguard proficiency.

On 1 June, &quot;Tigrone&quot; put in at Iwo Jima to disembark her passengers and on the next day, despite continuing radar problems, again got underway, returning to her patrol area on 3 June. Plagued by fog and radar malfunctions, &quot;Tigrone&quot; at last was forced to request to be assigned to lifeguard duty when a persistent loud scraping noise in the vicinity of her starboard shaft rendered normal submarine patrol and attack functions hazardous, if not impossible.

Operating south of Honshū, &quot;Tigrone&quot; joined the &quot;Lifeguard League&quot; and on 26 June recovered an aviator who had parachuted from his disabled fighter, rescuing him from the water only six minutes from the time his parachute blossomed. During the two days that followed, she took on rescued aviators from other submarines and set her course for Guam on 28 June. She ended her second war patrol on 3 July at Apra Harbor, having rescued a total of 30 aviators on this war patrol.

== Third patrol ==

Following refitting by submarine tender , &quot;Tigrone&quot; departed Guam on 31 July and, after the usual stop at Saipan for torpedoes, arrived on lifeguard station. As the submarine approached within 100 miles (160 km) of Honshū, the news arrived that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan. Patrolling nearer and nearer Honshū as American planes made strikes on Tokyo and other cities of the Japanese homeland, &quot;Tigrone&quot; encountered increasing numbers of Japanese search planes.

On 11 August, the first reports of Japan&#x27;s surrender were received, but, for two more days, &quot;Tigrone&quot; continued her patrols, approaching within 50 miles (80 km) of the shore of Sagami Wan as she pursued lifeguard duties. On 13 August, with Navy pilots helping to spot targets, she bombarded Mikomoto Island, scoring 11 hits on a radio station and lighthouse tower. The submarine claimed this action as the final bombardment of the war. On 14 August, &quot;Tigrone&quot; rescued another aviator who had been forced to parachute from his plane and, later in the day, spent an anxious half-hour attempting to evade persistent sonar contacts which turned out to be birds.

On 15 August, she received orders to cease all attacks; and, the next day, the official statement of Japan&#x27;s surrender was published. She patrolled off the east coast of Japan as far north as Sendai and Todo Saki. Then, on 30 August, she rendezvoused with &quot;Benny&#x27;s Peacemakers&quot; and, on the last day of August, moored in Tokyo Bay. She departed Tokyo on 2 September and made her way via Hawaii and the Canal Zone to New London, arriving there early in October 1945.

== Post-war activities ==

Later that month, she visited Washington, DC, for Navy Day activities and, late in December, reported to the Sixth Fleet at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for preservation procedures preparatory to inactivation. She was towed to New London and placed out of commission, in reserve, on 30 March 1946.

On 12 April 1948, her hull classification symbol was changed to SSR-419, radar picket submarine. In June, she was towed from New London to Portsmouth for conversion. She was recommissioned on 1 November 1948 and, early in 1949, conducted shakedown out of Portsmouth in preparation for her new duties as an Arctic radar picket. That summer, she joined Submarine Division 62 operating out of Norfolk to begin activities evaluating new radar equipment and techniques for long range air defense. She continued in this role until 1957, operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea and completing five Mediterranean Sea deployments with both American and NATO forces. On 1 August 1957, her status was changed to in commission, in reserve, and, on 1 November, she was decommissioned. She was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and berthed at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Redesignated SS-419 on 3 February 1961, she was recommissioned on 10 March 1962 and underwent overhaul and conversion at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard before reporting to New London for refresher training on 22 September. On 15 November, she departed New London for four weeks of shakedown out of Puerto Rico, and, on 14 December, she returned to New London to remain there into the new year. From April through August 1963, she operated in the Mediterranean Sea on deployment with the Sixth Fleet. She then returned to New London for local operations and to provide services for the Submarine School. On 1 December 1963, she was redesignated an auxiliary submarine with hull classification symbol AGSS-419. Early in 1964, she was fitted out with an experimental sonar unit. Through the end of 1964, she operated in conjunction with the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory and the Submarine School, testing and evaluating the new equipment.

In 1965, she underwent a major eight-month overhaul and modification at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Her torpedo tubes were removed, two forward compartments thoroughly sound isolated, and a new experimental sonar system, the Brass III, was installed. Operating as a research and development vessel in cooperation with the United States Underwater Sound Laboratory, she began duties which would fill the remaining years of her long career. Assigned primarily to data collection and sonar and acoustic tests in connection with the Brass program, she operated out of New London, conducting underwater systems tests as well as research in sound propagation.

In 1968, she visited Britain and port on the Norwegian Sea,
spent September through December in antisubmarine warfare exercises; and trained reserves. She continued her research assignments, joining with submarine in the early months of 1972 for a joint American-British oceanographic operation in the eastern Atlantic. She operated occasionally in the Caribbean Sea, taking part in Operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in 1973 and 1974. While moored at the Submarine Base in New London, on 25 October 1974, &quot;Tigrone&quot; observed the 30th anniversary of her commissioning. Into 1975, she continued research activities off the East Coast, which included a visit to Bermuda in March and operations with air units off Jacksonville and Atlantic City, New Jersey.

On 5 May, she began pre-inactivation procedures and, on 27 June 1975, was decommissioned at the Naval Submarine Base, Groton, Connecticut. At the time of her decommissioning, &quot;Tigrone&quot; was the oldest submarine in commission in the United States Navy, as well as the last unit of the submarine force still in operation to have taken part in combat action in World War II. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on that same day, and she was sunk as a target on 25 October 1976.

<text>Ian Deans (16 August 1937 – 3 May 2016) was a Scottish-Canadian politician. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1967 to 1979 and was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1980 to 1986.

==Background==
Deans was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland. He moved to Canada as a youth and found work as a firefighter. He met his wife, Diane, when she was a staffer on Parliament Hill. He helped her launch her own political career as an Ottawa-area city councillor. The couple were married for 22 years before divorcing. Afterwards, Deans moved back to the Hamilton area.

Deans died in Hamilton, Ontario on May 3, 2016, at the age of 78.

==Politics==
===Provincial===
He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a New Democratic Member in the 1967 provincial election representing the Hamilton area riding of Wentworth.

In 1970, he favoured a resolution that would force The Waffle, a radical left-wing group within the party, to be expelled. Deans objected to the organization because it recruited its own members, raised its own funds, and created its own policy, called &#x27;The Manifesto&#x27;. He said, &quot;You then become a political organization unto yourself.&quot; The resolution passed at an NDP convention in 1972. In 1970, Deans broke with most of his colleagues by expressing support for Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s implementation of the War Measures Act during the FLQ Crisis.

In 1978, he ran in the Ontario NDP leadership convention to succeed Stephen Lewis. Deans&#x27; earlier support for the War Measures Act became a point of contention and he recanted his position saying he was wrong and had regretted it ever since. Initially projected to be the front runner, he lost by less than 200 votes to Michael Cassidy. Deans resigned from the legislature the next year.

===Federal===
Deans moved to federal politics and won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada during the 1980 federal election representing Hamilton Mountain.

He served as House Leader for the New Democratic Party during the illness of Stanley Knowles, and became official House Leader following the 1984 federal election.

In the fall of 1986, he surprised colleagues by resigning from parliament to accept an appointment by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney as head of the Public Service Staff Relations Board, a position Deans went on to hold for 10 years.

In 2007, Deans returned to politics and was acclaimed as the federal NDP&#x27;s candidate in Brant. However, due to the onset of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, he dropped out of the race.

===Municipal===
In 2010, Deans said in an interview that he might run in the Hamilton Municipal Election in 2010 if his Parkinson&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t progressed any farther. On September 2, 2010, he announced he would be running for mayor of Hamilton in the 2010 Municipal Election. He was quoted as saying, &quot;The current city council &#x27;a laughing stock&#x27; that has made it impossible to sell anything to do with Hamilton.&quot; At the last minute, he changed his mind, withdrew from the Mayoral race and ran instead for the position of Ward 2 (Downtown) Councillor in a field of 20 candidates after the incumbent councillor, Bob Bratina, decided to run for Mayor. Deans finished in eighth place with 231 votes (3%).

<text>A &quot;Fifty-Niner&quot; is the term used for the gold seekers who streamed into the Pike&#x27;s Peak Country of western Kansas Territory and southwestern Nebraska Territory in 1859. The discovery of placer gold deposits along the South Platte River at the foot of the Rocky Mountains in northwestern Kansas Territory by a party of miners led by William Greeneberry &quot;Green&quot; Russell in July 1858 precipitated the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush.

Many Fifty-Niners took the &quot;Smoky Hill Trail&quot; west through Kansas Territory up the Kansas River valley. The last significant civilian settlement along this route was Manhattan, Kansas, several hundred miles east of the mountains. Between there and the mountains the Fifty-Niners had to cross the unmarked plains, often getting lost, and sometimes confronting Plains Indians. There is no record of how many prospective miners died en route to Pikes Peak.

The northern, or Platte River, route followed the Platte River through Nebraska along the Oregon Trail, then angled down along the South Platte River to the gold region.

The southern route followed the Santa Fe Trail along the Arkansas River to the vicinity of present-day Pueblo, Colorado, then north up Fountain Creek to the gold fields.

Among the most famous of the Fifty-Niners were Buffalo Bill Cody and millionaire miner Horace A. W. Tabor (although Tabor didn&#x27;t make his fortune until the subsequent &quot;Colorado Silver Boom&quot;).

No gold was found near Pikes Peak until after the gold rush, but it was the first visible landmark for those traveling west across the High Plains. This gave rise to the slogan, &quot;Pike&#x27;s Peak or Bust.&quot;

<text>The Rover 400 Series, and later the Rover 45, are a series of small family cars that were produced by the British manufacturer Rover from 1990 to 2005. The cars were co-developed as part of Rover&#x27;s collaboration with Honda. The first-generation 400 was based on the Honda Concerto, and the Mark II 400 (later the Rover 45) was based on the Honda Domani/Civic. 

Honda petrol engines were used in some Rover models, while the market competitive Rover L-series diesel engine was used from the mid-1990s in Hondas, before they designed their own diesel engine.
&#x27;

==Rover 400 (R8; 1990–1998)==
The original 400 Series, launched in 1990 as a four-door saloon, was a saloon version of the second-generation Rover 200 Series hatchback, both sharing the codename R8 during development. The 200 Series had been launched six months earlier. Like the 200, the model was designed in collaboration with Honda (who produced the corresponding designed for Europe Concerto model) and both models would share production lines at Rover&#x27;s Longbridge facility. It used the same core structure and mechanicals as the Honda, but the rear-end redesign of the glasshouse and body were unique to Rover. Interior trim and electrical architecture were all shared with the R8 Rover 200.
An estate — or station wagon — version was subsequently developed by Rover Special Products and introduced in the summer of 1994. Badged as the Rover 400 Tourer, this remained in production alongside the second-generation 400 until 1998, as no estate version of the latter car was built. Many of the 400 Tourers were exported to Japan.

The R8 Rover 200 and 400 were the first applications of Rover&#x27;s K-series family of engines (appearing in 1.4 L (1,396 cc) twin-cam 16-valve form). 

The 1.6 L (1,590 cc) version used either a Honda D16A6 and D16Z2 SOHC or D16A8 DOHC powerplant, while the 2.0 L M-series unit from the 800 Series followed soon afterwards (1991) in the sportier versions. 

The Rover-engined models drove the front wheels via jointly developed Peugeot/Rover R65 gearboxes (1.4 litre) and Rover PG1 for the 1.6- and 2.0-litre versions. The Rover 420 GSI turbo and GSI Sport turbo, produced in limited numbers, were equipped with the turbocharged 197 bhp (147 kW) Rover T-series engine. Also available were two PSA (non-electronically controlled Lucas CAV injection pumps) Indirect injection diesel engines, with the choice of naturally aspirated 1.9-litre XUD9 or turbocharged 1.8 XUD7T engines. The Tourer eschewed the 1.4, naturally aspirated diesel, and the turbocharged petrol-engined options.

These engines were installed instead of the non-electronically controlled Bosch HPVE Direct Injection Rover MDi / Perkins Prima used in the Austin Maestro and Montego, as that engine, with its noisy combustion but lower fuel consumption, was deemed too unrefined for the new models.

A mid-life facelift in September 1993 (also applied to the Rover 200) saw the reintroduction of the Rover grille, which first reappeared on the R17 facelift of the Rover 800. This change was achieved without significant change to the remaining structure, but provided a more distinctive Rover &quot;family look&quot; and established a certain distance from the Honda Concerto.
==Rover 400 (HH-R; 1995–1999)==


The second-generation 400 Series, codenamed Theta or HH-R, was launched in 1995 as a hatchback and later as a saloon. It was based on the Honda Domani, which had been released in Japan in 1992, and was sold as part of the European Honda Civic range in five-door hatchback form. It was no longer as closely related to the 200 Series, which was revised independently by Rover but still shared many components with the 400. It would prove to be the final collaborative model between Rover and Honda, ending a partnership that had begun with the Triumph Acclaim in 1981.

Power came from 1.4- and 1.6-litre K-series, 1.6-litre Honda D-series SOHC (automatic gearbox only), and 2.0-litre Rover T-series petrol engines, as well as a 2.0-litre L-series turbodiesel borrowed from the larger 600 Series.

The Rover 400 might have been marketed as a small family car, as it compared closely in size and engine range with contemporary models such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra. Instead, Rover priced the car to compete with vehicles like the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Vectra. This was because Rover&#x27;s only offering in the C/D segment at the time was the ageing Montego, and this gap in the company&#x27;s line-up needed to be filled. A saloon version was later introduced for the 400. 

The related Honda Civic was not sold as a saloon in the UK, although a four-door version was available in other markets. This helped to expand the appeal of the Rover model into the executive car segment, and to better differentiate the two cars. 

The second-generation 400 was initially popular, being one of Britain&#x27;s best-selling cars between 1995 and 1997. However, within three years it was being outsold by traditionally poorer-selling cars, such as the Volkswagen Passat and Renault Laguna.

==Rover 45 (1999–2005)==


The Rover 400 was given a facelift in 1999, becoming the Rover 45. It was repositioned and priced to compete with the Ford Focus and Vauxhall Astra, rather than larger cars like the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Vectra. From 2001, a re-engineered hot hatch version of the Rover 45 was launched and sold as the MG ZS.

The 1.4- and 1.6-litre K series petrol and 2.0-litre L series diesel engines were carried over from the 400 Series, along with the introduction of a 1.8 K series and a 2.0-litre V6 from the larger Rover 75 (replacing the 2.0 T series four-cylinder petrol unit) – although this power unit was only available on saloon versions. The 45 came equipped with the better seating of the 75 and whilst the 400 models handled very well, the suspension was tuned to give much better controlled ride characteristics with quicker steering.

The 45 was available with continuously variable transmission (CVT) supplied by the German manufacturer ZF Sachs which had previously been used in the MGF. This particular design of CVT consists of an oil cooled laminated steel belt (with external oil cooler) running on variable pulleys. The revised model boasted improved equipment levels, comfortable interior and reduced prices, compared with the preceding 400-badged models. While the asking price was now in line with other small family cars, the Rover 45 began to lose market share, its chances of success not helped by its aged design. Therefore, the 45 was never able to seriously compete with more modern designs, such as the Ford Focus and Vauxhall Astra in terms of popularity. It was also outsold by the likes of the Peugeot 307, Fiat Stilo, Volkswagen Golf and Renault Mégane.

A 2004 facelift was MG Rover&#x27;s last effort to boost sales of the Rover 45, with a new front and rear-end styling, a redesigned interior with refreshed dash, centre console and new switchgear, revised suspension settings, improved equipment and lower prices. Some of these changes were necessitated by the end of Domani production in Japan, as Honda refused to continue the supply of certain parts. 
Production of the car stopped in April 2005, due to MG Rover&#x27;s bankruptcy. Honda swiftly terminated the licensing agreement with MG Rover - (thus ending the last vestiges of the alliance between the two companies that had begun in 1980 with the Triumph Acclaim) and removed the remaining tooling and assembly lines for the car from Longbridge prior to its sale to Nanjing Automotive, which meant that no versions of the Rover 45/MG ZS were ever produced by Nanjing Automotive.

===Security Ratings===
Rover 45 models were tested on three occasions by Thatcham&#x27;s New Vehicle Security Ratings (NVSR) organisation, and achieved the following ratings:

==Powertrain==
These were the engines available for the Rover 400 (1995–1999) and Rover 45 (2000–2005):

==Replacement model projects==

===R30===
During the end of the 1990s, replacements for the Rover 25 and 45 models were developed by Rover Group under the codename &quot;R30&quot;. Intended for launch in 2003 as the Rover 35 and 55, these would have been based on an all new platform. At launch, these would have used K-series engines, but new Valvetronic engines were anticipated to be introduced by 2006. The R30 Project was cancelled, when BMW divested its ownership of Rover Group in March 2000. 

It is possible that some of the development work may eventually have benefited the BMW 1 Series.

===RD/X60===
Following the termination of the R30 Project, from 2001, MG Rover planned to replace the 45 with a model range based on the Rover 75 platform. Collectively referred to as the &quot;RD/X60&quot; project (sometimes also written &quot;RDX60&quot;), the range was intended to comprise the following variants:
*&quot;RD60&quot;: Rover hatchback
*&quot;X60&quot;: MG hatchback
*&quot;RD61&quot;: Rover saloon
*&quot;RD62&quot;: Rover &quot;tourer&quot; estate

A preview of how the RD62 &quot;Tourer&quot; might appear was given at the 2002 Geneva Motor Show in the form of the Rover TCV (Tourer Concept Vehicle) concept car.

During the design process, MG Rover&#x27;s design partner Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) went into administration. MG Rover lost access to most of the computer aided design work for their new vehicle. Efforts were made to reclaim these from the administrators, however, the resulting uncertainty and delays made it impossible to progress with the project.

The abortive SAIC Deal of August 2004 was to have included bringing a replacement for the ageing 45 to market, and the RD/X60 was a likely candidate for this. Ultimately, no such joint venture was entered into. After MG Rover&#x27;s collapse, SAIC bought some of the company&#x27;s intellectual property, and released a concept called the Roewe W2. Like the RD/X60, this was partly based on the platform of the Rover 75. The W2 entered production in April 2008, as the Roewe 550. 

A hatchback derivative of the 550 was announced in November 2009, as the MG6.

<text>Michael Graham () is an American conservative media personality and commentator based in Boston. He is a political editor for &quot;NH Journal&quot;, a columnist for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; and a CBS News analyst.

==Career==
Graham was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Pelion, South Carolina. A graduate of Oral Roberts University, he worked as a stand-up comedian before beginning his political career as a statewide coordinator for Pat Buchanan&#x27;s Primary campaign in 1992. This experience led to his working in various Republican campaigns over the next few years. One of his candidates included Harold Worley, a Republican challenger to Senator Strom Thurmond in 1996.

In 1998, Graham moved to the talk radio circuit. Living up to his self-proclaimed description of being &quot;loud, obnoxious and frequently fired,&quot; Graham held positions at seven stations in seven years, including stints in South Carolina, WRVA in Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., as well as Rightalk.com, an Internet radio outlet previously hosted by Accuracy in Media.

In 2002, Graham released his first printed book of original material, &quot;Redneck Nation: How the South Really Won the War&quot; through Warner Books.

Graham appeared on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;. In addition, he made a number of appearances during 2005 on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, and &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; pertaining to his &quot;America is at war with Islam&quot; controversy. Graham also appeared as a panelist on the local Washington, D.C., television program &quot;Eye on Washington,&quot; until his dismissal from WMAL in August 2005. In November 2005, Graham joined the lineup of Boston&#x27;s WTKK; his show, dubbed &quot;The Natural Truth,&quot; aired from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. His contract was not renewed and he parted ways with the station in December 2012, just before the station announced that it was abandoning the all-talk format and switching to music only.

Since 2005, Graham airs a weekly guest slot on the Monday edition of George Hook&#x27;s drive time show, &quot;The Right Hook&quot; on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Newstalk&quot;. Speaking from an American right-wing perspective, many of Graham&#x27;s views are often controversial to European audiences. In August 2009, Graham travelled to Dublin to present the show for three days while regular host George Hook was away.

On February 11, 2013, Graham began hosting a talk show on WCRN in Worcester, Massachusetts; the program was also heard on WBNW in Concord, WESO in Southbridge, WPLM in Plymouth, WXBR in Brockton and WCCM in Salem, New Hampshire. On August 5, 2013, his show premiered on the Boston Herald&#x27;s new online radio station. Graham left the Boston radio market at the end of April 2014 and spent two years in Atlanta at Cumulus-owned radio station WYAY (All News 106.7). He left that station in May 2016 following an on-air segment where he accused fellow talk show host Kim Peterson of using drugs and insinuated that Peterson engaged in bestiality.

==Controversy==
Graham has been involved in various controversies over his career.

* In July 2005, Graham used Islam and terrorism as the basis for a multi-day discussion on his WMAL talk radio show. A number of Graham&#x27;s comments prompted over one hundred complaints to the station and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) issued action alerts to its subscribers encouraging them to contact WMAL to urge that &quot;Graham be reprimanded for his anti-Islam statements,&quot; ultimately prompting WMAL to suspend him. After 28 days, WMAL elected to terminate Graham stating that he violated station policy and disregarded &quot;management direction&quot; to redress the situation. The situation prompted angry editorials from Graham as well as appearances on nationally televised news programs to discuss the firing.
* Graham attended a rally to protest the Real ID Act, sponsored by CASA de Maryland in May 2005. He was photographed in an INS shirt, and was blocked from entering the event even as he showed ABC Radio credentials, with officials citing public safety. An altercation ensued, and police were called, with a second altercation occurring following their arrival. After questioning, Graham was allowed to enter the event with his shirt turned inside out.
* Graham was fired from his first commercial talk-radio job at WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina, after comments he made on-air in the wake of the Columbine massacre in 1999. Just hours after the shootings he said that the killing of athletes at the school was &quot;one minor benefit of this otherwise horrible story.&quot;
* Graham drew criticism from blogs across the political spectrum for comments about Bill and Hillary Clinton made on CNN Headline News&#x27; &quot;Glenn Beck Show&quot; on June 20, 2007. Referring to a Clinton campaign ad based on the final episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Graham said &quot;...didn&#x27;t you at some point want to see, like, Paulie Walnuts, somebody come in here and just whack them both right there? Wouldn&#x27;t that have been great?...Come on! Where&#x27;s &quot;Big Pussy&quot;? Come on! Let&#x27;s make it happen...I wanted that.&quot; Beck did not agree with Graham&#x27;s comments.

* During a debate on the Irish radio channel Newstalk on May 28, 2010, the future President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, accused Graham of indulging in &quot;the radio of hysterical ignorance&quot; and urged him to &quot;be proud to be a decent American rather than being just a wanker whipping up fear.&quot;

<doc id="1058455" wikidata="Q7972479" url="?curid=1058455" title="Washington Township, Warren County, Ohio">
<text>Washington Township is one of the eleven townships of Warren County, Ohio, United States. Located in the east-central part of the county, it is the only one of the eleven that does not contain a municipality. The population was 2,752 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Located in the eastern part of the county, it borders the following townships:
*Massie Township – north
*Adams Township, Clinton County – northeast
*Vernon Township, Clinton County – east
*Harlan Township – south
*Salem Township – southwest
*Turtlecreek Township – west, across the Little Miami River
*Wayne Township – northwest

It was wholly within the Virginia Military District and was surveyed under the metes and bounds system.

The township is the home of Fort Ancient, a prehistoric earthwork built by the Mound Builders 2,000 years ago.

==Name and history==
Named for President George Washington, it shares its name with forty-two other Townships statewide.

Washington Township was created by the Warren County Commissioners on June 27, 1818.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Public services==
Most of the township is in the Clinton Massie Local School District, but parts are in the Little Miami Local School District and the Lebanon City School District. Telephone service is provided through the Lebanon, Clarksville, Morrow, and Waynesville exchanges. Mail is delivered through the Clarksville, Lebanon, Oregonia and Waynesville post offices.

<text>The Rover 600 Series was a compact executive car range that was produced by the British manufacturer Rover from 1993 to 1999.

The exterior of the Rover 600 was designed by Rover, a reskin of the European Honda Accord, also built in the United Kingdom by Honda in Swindon. The core structure and vast majority of the engineering content was sourced from Honda but the vehicles were designed at the same time, with a small Rover team on site in Japan. Colour and trim derivatives were also used to help separate the Rover from the Honda in the marketplace. 

The 1.8, 2.0 and 2.3 litre inline-four petrol engines were all provided by Honda. However, the 2.0 litre turbodiesel Rover L-series engine and turbocharged T-series engines were developed by Rover itself, evolutions of units already available elsewhere in the Rover model range.

The 600&#x27;s interior included wood and chrome trim, as well as relatively high equipment levels, although rear legroom was criticised by &quot;Parkers&quot; as rather constrained. The interior was similar to the Japanese built Honda Ascot Innova, except with a few cosmetic changes. Carpet was also not evident along the bottom trim of the dashboard, although it did feature there on the Innova.

The Honda derived chassis was reported to give a comfortable but unsporting ride. Given the Rover&#x27;s equipment, prices were reasonably competitive in the large family car segment, and considerably lower than the price of such compact executive cars, such as the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. Unlike the Montego, there was never an estate version of the 600 Series, with no direct replacement being launched for the estate version of the Montego when it was discontinued at the end of 1994. An estate would eventually resurface with the Rover 75 Tourer when it was launched in July 2001.

==History==
Launched on 19 April 1993, the 600 Series replaced the Montego saloon in the Rover range, but because the 600 was positioned considerably further upmarket in relation to its predecessor, the entry-level Montego models were kept in production primarily for the fleet market. 

Production continued until the beginning of 1999, when it was replaced with the retro styled Rover 75, developed under BMW&#x27;s stewardship. The 75 also replaced the larger 800 Series. The 600 had been a popular car in the compact executive sector, with a large percentage of sales being to the fleet market.

In 1984, while in the final stages of developing the Rover 800 series saloon, it was planned to sell the hatchback version from its launch a year later as the Rover 600 Series, but these plans were abandoned and instead the hatchback became part of the 800 Series when it launched in 1988.

===Development===
Originally, the Austin Rover Group (ARG) had intended to replace the Montego with the AR16 and AR17 concepts - these were essentially the existing Montego underpinnings and core structure reskinned with new outer body panels to mimic the design language of the Rover 800 (XX) and would have been called the Rover 400-series. AR16 was a saloon, whilst AR17 was to be a hatchback which would compete directly with the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. However, shortly after the restructuring of ARG and its parent company British Leyland into the Rover Group, the plan was cancelled due to a lack of funds and as a stopgap, a facelifted and revised Montego (Project AR9) was released for the 1989 model year.

In June 1989, Rover reached an agreement with Honda (its partner in a venture which had been running since 1980) to produce a new model which would share its base with the next generation Honda Accord, but would use Rover&#x27;s own engines. It would be aimed further upmarket than the Montego, competing more directly with the likes of the BMW 3 Series than with the Ford Mondeo, which was launched at around the same time.

Having been unveiled to the motoring press towards the end of 1992, the Rover 600 Series finally went on sale on 19 April 1993, two months before the new Accord on which it was based, although it had been well known within the motoring press that both cars were derived from the Japanese market Ascot Innova which had launched in March 1992, therefore the engineering and interior design elements of both the 600 and European-market Accord were essentially already in the public domain almost a year before their European launch.

Its introduction saw the Montego saloon withdrawn from production after nine years, although production of the estate model continued until the end of the following year. 

Rover recalled 21,634 600 Series&#x27; built between December 1994 and December 1995 in May 1996, to check a potential steering rack fault.

==Versions==
The 600 was available in the following versions:
* 618i
* 618 Si
* 620i
* 620 Si
* 620 SLi
* 620 GSi
* 623 SLi
* 623 GSi
* 623 i&quot;S&quot;
* 620ti
* 620 SDi
* 620 SLDi
* 620 GSDi

Badging was determined by engine size: 618 models had 1.8 litre engines, 620 had 2.0 engines, 623 had 2.3 litre engines. With the exception of the T-Series 620ti, all petrol engines were sourced from Honda, and all diesel versions were L-series units. The Rover K-series engine was not used in the 600.

The 600 was available in a number of different trims. All models had power steering, electric front windows, remote central locking with alarm and immobiliser and tinted windows. The Si had split rear seats, Si Auto and above got a sunroof. SLi trim added electric rear windows and wooden door trim; GSi models received 15&quot; multispoke alloys and full leather trim. 

From 1994, all cars had a driver&#x27;s airbag. The 623i&quot;S&quot; had half leather trim and a small lip spoiler on its boot. The ti featured a set of 16&quot; six spoke alloys with uprated suspension, &#x27;Torsen&#x27; gearbox and a dark half leather interior.

Run out models included:

* 618iL
* 618iS
* 620iSD
* 620iLD

S and SD models had the appearance of the 620ti, with the same six spoke 16&quot; alloy wheels and half leather trim. L and LD models had seven spoke 15&quot; alloy wheels and full leather trim resembling the GSi models.

The range was revised/mildly &quot;facelifted&quot; twice. 

The first revisions were in 1996, which included a slightly revised interior, with a padded front arm rest and separate rear head rests, all models, apart from the ti, had 15&quot; wheels, high level brake light, new alarm and immobiliser system (the alarm changed from an infra red to a radio controlled handset and the ignition key became a &#x27;transponder key&#x27;, without which the immobiliser could not be disarmed), drink holders in the front doors, electric headlight adjuster and all models from Si specification upwards receive air conditioning and 15&quot; alloys. 

At this time, the T-series changed ignition system from Distributor to &#x27;wasted spark&#x27;, pistons, Klinger head gasket, LSD and the steering was changed to Rover&#x27;s Positive Centre Feel (PCF) system. United Kingdom cars which featured these revisions were all badged as &quot;600&quot; only, in line with most other models in the Rover range which no longer had badging by engine sizes.

The final revisions came in 1997, just over a year later, and all cars got slightly lowered suspension (~10 mm) and body coloured sills, rubbing strips, door handles and door mirror covers.

==620ti==

In 1994, the 620ti was launched. It had a turbocharged, intercooled, 16 valve, twin cam 2.0 litre T series engine, a top speed of , and a 0-60 mph time of seven seconds, thanks to and torque. The 620ti also had uprated suspension, dark half leather upholstery, and a set of six spoke 16 inch alloy wheels. 

&quot;Autocar&quot; magazine (8 February 1995) had an example on a long term test, and found it to be as quick in the mid range as a Ford Sierra Sapphire 2.0i RS Cosworth, following tests at Millbrook Proving Ground.

==Reviews==
*The AA &lt;br&gt;&#x27;The Rover 600 ... has the finest power units and sweetest gearchange ... its unique aura and good looks will appeal to those who buy with their hearts not their heads. (But) the 600 costs more to buy and run. It is under equipped and takes up a lot of space outside, without offering any of the benefit ... inside.&#x27;
*Honest John &lt;br&gt;Positives: Smart looking car, best with 2.3 litre engine, Honda Accord based and the most reliable Rover of its era.&lt;br&gt;Negatives: Lacklustre ride and handling, prone to inner rear wings rust, T-Series engines suffer head gasket trouble.
*RAC &lt;br&gt;&#x27;A sound design that managed to keep the Rover image moving upmarket. If you want British luxury and quality Japanese engineering, the 600 could be just your cup of Earl Grey. Many buyers are now realising what a bargain this combination of cultures represents. Try one and be surprised – it&#x27;s better than you might think.&#x27;

The pottery is characterized by the use of highly-stylized designs, including the oculus motif. Another example of these stylized designs are found in Morbihan, France, on the Carnac megaliths.

<text>Malindi is a town on Malindi Bay at the mouth of the Sabaki River, lying on the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya. It is 120 kilometres northeast of Mombasa. The population of Malindi was 119,859 as of the 2019 census. It is the largest urban centre in Kilifi County.

==Overview==

Tourism is the major industry in Malindi. Notable heritage sites include the Vasco da Gama Pillar, the Portuguese Chapel, the House of Columns and the Malindi Museum Heritage Complex.

Malindi is served with a domestic airport and a highway between Mombasa and Lamu. The nearby Watamu town and Gedi Ruins (also known as Gede) are south of Malindi. The mouth of the Sabaki River lies in northern Malindi.

The Watamu and Malindi Marine National Parks form a continuous protected coastal area south of Malindi. The area shows classic examples of Swahili architecture. The majority of Malindi&#x27;s population is Muslim.

Malindi is home to the Malindi Airport and the Broglio Space Center (the previous &quot;San Marco Equatorial Range&quot;).

== History ==
Malindi developed as part of the emerging Swahili civilisation in the 5th–10th centuries. Bantu-speaking farmers moved into the area, where they smelted iron, built timber and wattle houses thatched with palm leaves, spoke a local dialect of kiSwahili, and engaged in regional and sometimes long-distance trade. The resurgence of the Indian Ocean trade networks at the end of the first millennium led to larger settlements, increased long-distance trade, and greater social complexity. Beginning in the 11th century, the Swahili along the coast were acting as middlemen for Somali, Egyptian, Nubian, Arab, Persian, and Indian traders. They began building walled towns, coral houses, and elites converted to Islam, often speaking Arabic.

The Malindi Kingdom appears to have been formed around the 9th century AD and to have grown powerful in the two centuries before Vasco da Gama ushered in the Portuguese colonisation of the region, the latter leading to the decline of the civilisation. The city of Malindi, founded around 850 AD, was in a somewhat more northerly location than the modern city, and appears to have been destroyed around 1000 AD. There are sparse signs of habitation for the next two centuries, then recovery and prosperity in the 1200s.

The first written reference to the present-day Malindi likely comes from Abu al-Fida (1273–1331), a Kurdish geographer and historian. He wrote that Malindi was situated to the south of the mouth of a river which began in a mountain hundreds of miles away. This mountain may be Mount Kenya, where the Galana River rises. Thus, Malindi has existed as a Swahili settlement since at least the 13th century.

Once rivalled only by Mombasa for dominance in this part of East Africa, Malindi has traditionally been a port city. In 1414, the town was visited by the fleet of the Chinese explorer Zheng He. Malindi&#x27;s ruler sent a personal envoy with a giraffe as a present to China on that fleet.

The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama met Malindi authorities in 1498 to sign a trade agreement and hire a guide for the voyage to India, when he erected a padrão known today as the Vasco da Gama Pillar. Vasco da Gama was given a warm reception from the Sultan of Malindi, which contrasted with the hostile reception he encountered in Mombasa. It is a popular tourist attraction for both local and international tourists.

In 1498 Malindi was a prosperous town with a population between 5,000 and 10,000. The majority of the population was Muslim by this period, having converted largely between the 13th and 14th centuries. Like other Mediaeval Swahili towns, the ruling class or &quot;wazee&quot; was made up of the heads of the wealthiest patrician families. Similar to other Bantu-speaking peoples, these clan leaders elected a &quot;mwenye mui&quot; or chief who spoke on behalf of the patricians. The Portuguese mistakenly titled these individuals &quot;Kings,&quot; misunderstanding the nature of Swahili political organisation. The &quot;wazee&quot; spoke both Swahili and Arabic, and claimed mythological origins from the East, most often Persia.

Malindi&#x27;s main source of prosperity was the export of ivory and rhino horns as well as exporting agricultural products such as coconuts, oranges, millet and rice. In the years before the arrival of the Portuguese, Malindi was a regional power but lagged significantly behind the two greatest states, Mombasa and Kilwa. When, in 1499, the Portuguese established a trading post in Malindi that served as a rest stop on the way to and from India, they were eagerly welcomed by the &quot;wazee&quot; who sought to use the Portuguese military might to establish themselves over their rivals in Mombasa. In 1500, King Dom Manuel I offered vassal status to Malindi. Malindi supported Portugal&#x27;s successful efforts to conquer Kilwa and Mombasa in 1505. In 1502, the Portuguese established a factory in Malindi, which lasted till 1593. The decline of Kilwa and Mombasa led to Malindi&#x27;s flourishing. Malindi grew as other Swahili, as well as Arab, Persian, and Indian, merchants, craftsmen, sailors, and labourers flocked to newly powerful city.

Malindi remained the centre of Portuguese activity in eastern Africa until 1593, when the Portuguese moved their main base to Mombasa. This was through the help of the Segejus and the Sheikh of Malindi. As the major East African ally of Portugal along the Swahili Coast, Malindi supported Portugal&#x27;s successful efforts to conquer Kilwa and Mombasa. The two Swahili city states often had feuds with each other as they fought for dominance over the trade. In his military struggles against Mombasa, the Sheikh of Malindi allied with the Portuguese and Segeju to take over the city. In 1592, the Segeju occupied Mombasa, eventually surrendering it to the Sheikh of Malindi. The Sheikh then moved his court from Malindi to Mombasa and ruled from 1593 to 1630. During this time, he invited his allies, the Portuguese, to build a Garrison and they dominated the city.
After the Portuguese departed the town gradually declined until it almost disappeared by the end of 17th century. An 1823 United Kingdom Admiralty chart of &#x27;Melinda&#x27; declared that at that time there were &#x27;no vestiges of the once splendid city of Melinda&#x27; apart from Vasco da Gama&#x27;s Pillar. In 1845, Ludwig Krapf visited the town and found it overgrown by vegetation and uninhabited. A Portuguese chapel with a graveyard was built before 1542 when Francis Xavier visited the town. Many buildings of Swahili architecture survive, including the Juma Mosque.
Malindi was refounded by Sultan Majid of Zanzibar in 1861 and until the end of 19th century served as a centre of the slave trade. A plan of the town in 1873 indicates the area of occupation by that time. In 1890, Malindi came under British administration and slave trade and slavery were abolished. This act led to a significant decline in agricultural production. Outside agriculture there were few industries in Malindi at the beginning of the 20th century; among them were making mats and bags, crushing sesame seeds for oil and producing a Swahili drink called tembo. Malindi was officially made a town in 1903. Ten years later its population stood at around 1148 and included 843 Africans, 230 Arabs, 67 Asians and 8 Europeans.
Malindi experienced a trade boom between the end of the World War I and 1925, when a famine occurred. Exports to foreign ports grew to £26,000 by 1924. Europeans started to return to Malindi in the 1930s, buying land from Arabs. Some of them like Commander Lawford opened the first hotels, which became the foundation of the future tourist industry. During World War II, Malindi was one of only two towns in East Africa bombed by the Italians. This happened on 24 October 1940, and after this event allied troops were stationed in the town until the end of the war. After World War II Malindi began developing into a resort.

==Climate==
Malindi has a tropical dry savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;As&quot;).
== Local governance ==
Malindi now falls under Kilifi County as per the administrative changes in the new constitution passed in August 2010. Malindi forms a municipal council with the following thirteen wards: Barani, Ganda/Mkaumoto, Gede, Gede North, Gede South, Kijiwetanga, Madunguni, Malimo, Malindi Central, Malindi North, Maweni, Shella, and Watamu Town. All of them are located within Malindi Constituency.

==In popular culture==
The novel &quot;“MALI D’AFRICA”&quot; (by Sara Cardelli) describes an impossible love in Malindi.

Most of the events in Andrei Gusev’s novels &quot;Once in Malindi&quot; (2021) and &quot;Our Wild Sex in Malindi&quot; (2020) take place in Malindi, Watamu, or Lamu. The novels describe the protagonists&#x27; (Russian writer Andy and his wife Jennifer, who was born in Kenya) lives in these towns in the 2010s.

The song &quot;“Yasoi Malindi”&quot; was written by Yasoy Kala Kana about the town.

<doc id="1058484" wikidata="Q1069948" url="?curid=1058484" title="Awamori">
<text>Awamori (, Okinawan: , ) is an alcoholic beverage indigenous and unique to Okinawa, Japan. It is made from long grain indica rice, and is not a direct product of brewing (like &quot;sake&quot;) but of distillation (like &quot;shōchū&quot;). The majority of &quot;awamori&quot; made today uses indica rice imported from Thailand, as the local production is largely insufficient to meet domestic demand, which has risen considerably in recent years.

&quot;Awamori&quot; is typically 60–86 proof (30–43% alcohol), although &quot;export&quot; brands (including brands shipped to mainland Japan) are increasingly 50 proof (25% alcohol). Some styles (notably &quot;hanazake&quot;) are 120 proof (60%) and are flammable. &quot;Awamori&quot; is aged in traditional clay pots to improve its flavor and mellowness.

The most popular way to drink &quot;awamori&quot; is with water and ice. When served in a restaurant in Okinawa, it will nearly always be accompanied by a container of ice and carafe of water. &quot;Awamori&quot; can also be drunk straight, on the rocks, and in cocktails. Traditionally, &quot;awamori&quot; was served in a &quot;kara-kara&quot;, a small earthen vessel with a small clay marble inside. The marble would make a distinctive &quot;kara-kara&quot; sound to let people know the vessel was empty. These vessels are still found in Okinawa, but the clay marbles are often absent.

Another name for &quot;awamori&quot; used in Okinawa is , or &quot;shima&quot; for short.

In general, the price of &quot;awamori&quot; increases with the beverage&#x27;s age.

&quot;Kōrēgusu&quot; is a type of hot sauce made of chillis infused in &quot;awamori&quot; and is a popular condiment to Okinawan dishes such as Okinawa soba.

In December 2024, UNESCO added knowledge and traditional techniques used for making sake, awamori and shochu to its Intangible Cultural Heritage list. 

Awamori is the oldest distilled alcoholic drink in Japan, and is believed to predate shochu. 

==History==

&quot;Awamori&quot; owes its existence to Okinawa&#x27;s trading history. It originates from the Thai drink &quot;lao khao&quot;. The technique of distilling reached Ryukyu Kingdom, today&#x27;s Okinawa, from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (roughly present-day Thailand) in the 15th century, a time when Okinawa served as a major trading intermediary between Southeast Asia, China, and Japan. All &quot;awamori&quot; is made from Thai (&quot;indica&quot;) rice. The Okinawans refined the distillation process, incorporating techniques from nearby countries, making it more suitable for the subtropical climate and incorporating the unique local black koji mold. From the 15th to 19th century, &quot;awamori&quot; was sent as a tribute to Okinawa&#x27;s powerful neighbors, to the shogun during the Edo period, and was served to show hospitality to envoys from China. Strict control for the production and sale of awamori was implemented by the Ryukyu government, which only allowed the upper classes consumption and serving overseas dignitaries, including Commodore Matthew C. Perry.

Before April 1983, &quot;awamori&quot; was labelled as a second class &quot;shochu&quot;; it is now labelled as &quot;authentic &quot;awamori&quot;&quot;.

In 2017, facing declining sales in the home market, three of Okinawa&#x27;s prominent &quot;awamori&quot; distilleries combined their efforts to introduce &quot;awamori&quot; to overseas markets, specifically to the US and Europe. The product, branded Ryukyu 1429, made its UK debut in June 2019.

==Production==
Although &quot;awamori&quot; is a distilled rice liquor, it differs from Japanese &quot;shochu&quot; in several ways. &quot;Awamori&quot; is made in a single fermentation while &quot;shochu&quot; usually uses two fermentations. Furthermore, &quot;awamori&quot; uses Thai-style, long-grained Indica crushed rice rather than the short-grained Japonica usually used in &quot;shochu&quot; production. Finally, awamori exclusively uses black &quot;koji&quot; mold (&quot;Aspergillus luchuensis&quot;) indigenous to Okinawa, while Japanese &quot;shochu&quot; uses white (&quot;A. luchuensis&quot; var. &quot;kawachii&quot;), black (&quot;Aspergillus awamori&quot;), and yellow (&quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;) koji molds.

==&quot;Kusu&quot;==

When &quot;awamori&quot; is aged for three years or more, it is called . This pronunciation, which derives from Okinawan, is unique to &quot;awamori&quot;; elsewhere in Japan, the word is pronounced &quot;&quot;koshu&quot; and refers to aged &quot;sake&quot;. Legally, in order to earn the designation &quot;kusu&quot;&quot;, the &quot;awamori&quot; must be aged for a minimum of three years. If a specific age is noted, then all of the contents must be of at least that age. &quot;Awamori&quot; is aged underground in constant cool temperatures in clay pots or vases. Containers of awamori can be found in the caves of Okinawa.

Before the Battle of Okinawa during World War II, 200- and even 300-year-old &quot;kusu&quot; existed, but most of the oldest &quot;kusu&quot; were lost in the battle. However, the Shikina Distillery in Shuri own 100- and 150-year old &quot;kusu&quot; which are thought to be to be the oldest surviving. There are ongoing attempts to once again produce 200- and 300- year old &quot;kusu.&quot;

==&quot;Hanazake&quot;==
On Yonaguni, Japan&#x27;s westernmost island, the three distilleries of Donan, Yonaguni and Maifuna produce a variant of &quot;awamori&quot; called , lit. &quot;flower liquor&quot;, which has an alcohol content of 60%. Originally intended for religious ceremonies, &quot;hanazake&quot; is traditionally consumed straight.

==Etymology==
The earliest known use of the term is in a 1671 record of a gift from King Shō Tei of the Ryukyu Kingdom to the fourth &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Ietsuna. Awamori was sent as a gift to the shogunate prior to 1671, but it was recorded as shōchū (焼酒 or 焼酎) in earlier records.

Several explanations exist for the etymology of the word &quot;awamori&quot;. The Okinawan historian Iha Fuyū believed that the name derives from the word for , compounded with a verb-derived noun meaning . On this theory, the word was recorded incorrectly with the first character as rather than the character for . Millet was a raw material used to make &quot;awamori&quot; at the time that the word was first used.
Another hypothesis is that the name comes from a method that was used in the past for assessing the quality of distilled liquors. This method was to slowly pour the liquor from a small bowl held in one hand into an empty bowl held in the other hand about one foot below. The desired result was for a large number of small to in the lower bowl as the liquor is poured into it. Longer-lasting bubbles were also seen as desirable.

<text>A statue menhir is a type of carved standing stone created during the later European Neolithic Period.

The statues consist of a vertical slab or pillar with a stylised design of a human figure cut into it, sometimes with hints of clothing or weapons visible.

==Locations==
They are most commonly found in Southern France and western France, Catalonia, Corsica, Sardinia, Italy and the Alps. A group from the Iron Age also is known in Liguria and Lunigiana.

There are two in Guernsey, &quot;La Gran&#x27; Mère du Chimquière&quot; (&#x27;the Grandmother of the Cemetery&#x27;), a highly detailed example in the churchyard of Parish of Saint Martin, and another known simply as &quot;La Gran&#x27; Mère&quot; in the Parish of Castel. The latter is an earlier, less detailed example found buried underneath the porch of the parish church.

<doc id="1058504" wikidata="Q836115" url="?curid=1058504" title="Lacombe, Lucien">
<text>Lacombe, Lucien () is a 1974 French war drama film by Louis Malle about a French teenage boy during the German occupation of France in World War II.

&quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and the U.S. National Board of Review Award as one of the Top 5 Foreign Films of the Year.

==Plot==
In June 1944, as the Allies are fighting the Germans in Normandy, Lucien Lacombe, a 17-year-old country boy, tries to join the Resistance. The local Resistance leader, the village school teacher, turns him down on grounds of age. Lucien travels back to the town where he works by bicycle and stumbles on the hotel that is the headquarters of the Carlingue, the French auxiliaries of the Gestapo, and is taken into custody. Under the influence of alcohol, he betrays the teacher, who is brought in and tortured. Seeing that Lucien could be useful, the Carlingue recruit him into their lawless regime of extortion and terror.

He enjoys his new power and position, but falls in love with France Horn, a beautiful French-born Jewish girl living in seclusion with her father Albert, a tailor, and her paternal grandmother Bella, who left Paris in fear and are trying to cross the border into the safety of neutral Spain. Their sophistication stands in contrast to Lucien&#x27;s uncouth nature and lack of education. Forcing himself into a relationship with the girl, Lucien comes to be protective of the very people targeted by his superiors. He is warned that the Allies are winning and that as a collaborator he will be killed.

Albert goes to Carlingue headquarters to see Lucien to discuss his relationship with his daughter man-to-man but is taken into custody by the head of the Carlingue and turned over to the Germans. After members of the Resistance attack the hotel, the inhabitants of the town are rounded up in retribution. Lucien and a German soldier arrest France and Bella but Lucien decides to kill the soldier. He takes the women by car toward Spain but the vehicle breaks down and they go on by foot until they find shelter in a secluded and abandoned farmhouse.

A text epilogue states that Lucien Lacombe was arrested on October 12, 1944, tried and condemned to death by a military tribunal of the Resistance, and executed.

==Production==
Malle wrote the screenplay with novelist Patrick Modiano. Originally, they titled the script &quot;Le faucon&quot; (&quot;The Falcon&quot;) and intended to set it in present-day Mexico, but Malle was not allowed to shoot in Mexico (nor in Chile), so he rewrote the script, giving it a wartime French setting. The script was retitled &quot;Le milicien&quot; (&quot;The Milice Man&quot;).

The film was shot in the Lot and Tarn-et-Garonne departments, specifically in the communes of Figeac, Arcambal, Montauban and Sénaillac-Lauzès.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews, and an average rating of 8.9/10.

Vincent Canby, film critic for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; gave it a positive review. He wrote, &quot;&quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; is easily Mr. Malle&#x27;s most ambitious, most provocative film, and if it is not as immediately affecting as &quot;The Fire Within&quot; or even the comic &quot;Murmur of the Heart,&quot; it&#x27;s because—to make his point—he has centered it on a character who must remain forever mysterious, forever beyond our sympathy.&quot;

Pauline Kael wrote of her admiration for Malle&#x27;s expressive camerawork and visual capabilities. Behind Lucien&#x27;s blasé, almost empty visage, Kael saw a world of dialogue: &quot;Malle&#x27;s gamble is that the cameras will discover what the artist&#x27;s imagination can&#x27;t, and, steadily, startlingly, the gamble pays off. Without ever mentioning the subject of innocence and guilt, this extraordinary film, in its calm, dispassionate way, addresses it on a very deep level.&quot;

Film critic Dan Schneider liked the film, especially Malle&#x27;s casting of Blaise. Schneider wrote, &quot;Every so often a director makes an inspiring casting choice to not hire a real actor for a role, but go with an unknown, an amateur. Perhaps the best example of this was in Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s 1952 film &quot;Umberto D&quot; ... Yet, not that far behind has to be Louis Malle&#x27;s decision to cast the lead character for his 1974 film, &quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; with an amateur named Pierre Blaise. No actor would likely be able to capture the natural ferality that Blaise brings to the role of a none-too-bright French farm boy who unwittingly, at first, becomes an accomplice and collaborator with the Gestapo in the final months of Vichy France, in late 1944.&quot;

Film critic Wheeler Winston Dixon discussed why the film was controversial: &quot;Louis Malle&#x27;s drama &quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; is one of the most effective films about the capitulation of France to the Nazis during World War II, and one of the most controversial ... Louis Malle&#x27;s film was daring for its time for suggesting that not every member of the French public was a member of the Resistance; that indeed, many were willing accomplices to the Vichy government, and the sting of the film remains to this day.&quot;

<text>Mary Fleener (born September 14, 1951) is an American alternative comics artist, writer and musician from Los Angeles. Fleener&#x27;s drawing style, which she calls &quot;cubismo&quot;, derives from the cubist aesthetic and other artistic traditions. Her first publication was a work about Zora Neale Hurston, called &quot;Hoodoo&quot; (1988), followed by the semi-autobiographical comics series &quot;Slutburger&quot;, and the anthology &quot;Life of the Party&quot; (1996). She is a member of the rock band called The Wigbillies.

Among Fleener&#x27;s influences are ancient Egyptian art and the works of Chester Gould (&quot;Dick Tracy&quot;), Otto Soglow (&quot;The Little King&quot;) and Al Capp (&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;). Robert Crumb and Robert Armstrong (creator of Mickey Rat) encouraged her to create her own comics.

Her works have been exhibited at La Luz de Jesus Gallery, Track 16, David Zapt Gallery, Laguna Beach Art Museum Annex, LACE (Los Angeles), COCA (Seattle), Southwestern College, Patricia Correia Gallery, Sushi Gallery. In 2020 her work was included in the exhibit &quot;Women in Comics: Looking Forward, Looking Back&quot; at the Society of Illustrators in New York City.

She lives and works in Encinitas, California.

== Early life and education ==

Mary Fleener was born in 1951. Her mother had worked for Disney from 1941 to 1943. Fleener attended Cal State Long Beach for 4 years where she focused on printmaking, but she disliked the art program&#x27;s focus on abstract works and dropped out in 1976. In 1984, she read an article &quot;new comix,&quot; by Matt Groening in the LA WEEKLY that inspired her to create her first comic works. She developed her aesthetic on her own, and considers herself self-taught.

== Early works ==

She started drawing minicomics in 1984 and published her first full work, &quot;Hoodoo&quot;, four years later. Her semi-autobiographical &quot;Slutburger Stories&quot; were first published by Rip Off Press, and later by Drawn &amp; Quarterly. Many of Fleener&#x27;s short stories appeared in anthologies like &quot;Weirdo&quot; and &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot; and the all-women &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix;&quot; and her illustrations appeared in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Fleener went on to create more semi-autobiographical strips that were released in 1996 in the anthology &quot;Life of the Party&quot;, published by Fantagraphics. These comix depicted the artist and a colorful cast of characters playing in rock bands, surfing, going to college, and gleefully partaking of drugs and casual sex, among other things. Fleener&#x27;s art style complements her stories, which are narrated in matter-of-fact but bemused first-person dialogue.

<text>Columbus Calvin &quot;Duke&quot; Pearson Jr. (August 17, 1932 – August 4, 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer. &quot;Allmusic&quot; describes him as having a &quot;big part in shaping the Blue Note label&#x27;s hard bop direction in the 1960s as a record producer.&quot;

==Early life==
Pearson was born Columbus Calvin Pearson Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, to Columbus Calvin and Emily Pearson. The moniker &quot;Duke&quot; was given to him by his uncle, who was a great admirer of Duke Ellington. Before he was six, his mother started giving him piano lessons. He studied the instrument until he was twelve, when he took an interest in brass instruments: mellophone, baritone horn and ultimately trumpet. He was so fond of the trumpet that through high school and college he neglected the piano. He attended Clark College while also playing trumpet in groups in the Atlanta area. While in the U.S. Army, during his 1953–54 draft, he continued to play trumpet and met, among others, the pianist Wynton Kelly. Pearson himself confessed in a 1959 interview that he was &quot;so spoiled by Kelly&#x27;s good piano&quot; that he decided to switch to piano again. Also, it seems that dental problems forced him to give up brass instruments.

==Career==
Pearson performed with different ensembles in Georgia and Florida, including with Tab Smith and Little Willie John, before he moved to New York City in January 1959. He had, however, been able to get at least one song, &quot;Tribute to Brownie&quot; (dedicated to Clifford Brown), recorded by the Cannonball Adderley Quintet on their 1957 album, &quot;Sophisticated Swing&quot;. In New York, Pearson gained the attention of the trumpeter Donald Byrd, who saw Pearson performing with the Art Farmer/Benny Golson Sextet (known as the Jazztet). Shortly afterwards, Byrd asked Pearson to join his newly formed band, the Donald Byrd–Pepper Adams Quintet. Pearson was also the accompanist for Nancy Wilson on tour in 1961. During that same year, Pearson became ill before a Byrd-Adams show, and a newcomer, Herbie Hancock, took over for him. Hancock eventually took over the position permanently.

On the 1963 Byrd album &quot;A New Perspective&quot;, Pearson arranged four tracks, including &quot;Cristo Redentor&quot;, which became a hit. The composition, Pearson later commented, was inspired by a trip he took to Brazil while touring with Wilson. Also that year, after the death of Ike Quebec, Pearson took over his position as A&amp;R man of Blue Note. From that year until 1970, Pearson was a frequent session musician and producer for numerous Blue Note albums while also recording his own albums as bandleader. This was odd, since Pearson also recorded with his co-led big band with Byrd for Atlantic Records, a stipulation he made sure was in his Atlantic contract. The Byrd-Pearson band consisted of musicians such as Chick Corea, Pepper Adams, Randy Brecker, and Garnett Brown; the latter three were members also of the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis band that played the same night club, The Village Vanguard, but on different nights. Between the two ensembles, the musicians performed at their own discretion.

Pearson&#x27;s compositions include the now standard, frequently covered &quot;Jeannine&quot;, composed c. 1960. An early cover of &quot;Jeannine&quot; appears on the Cannonball Adderley album &quot;Them Dirty Blues&quot;, recorded in February 1960; the song was also covered by Donald Byrd on the album &quot;At the Half Note Cafe&quot;, recorded in November 1960. A vocalese version with lyrics by Oscar Brown, Jr. was recorded by Eddie Jefferson on the album &quot;The Main Main,&quot; recorded in October 1974, and was covered on The Manhattan Transfer&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Bop Doo-Wopp&quot;. The Steve Lehman Trio recorded the song on their 2011 album &quot;Dialect Fluorescent&quot;.

As a small side project at Blue Note, Pearson penned the liner notes for Grant Green’s 1963 album, &quot;Idle Moments&quot;. He was the pianist for the recording. Having also composed the album’s title track, he wrote, “I wonder while listening to this recording, just what the people involved were thinking of while idling away (so to speak). The dreamlike mood that prevails gave me the idea of naming this tune &quot;Idle Moments&quot;.”

Pearson eventually retired from his position with Blue Note in 1971 after personnel changes were made; co-founder Alfred Lion retired in 1967 after the label was sold to Liberty Records the previous year, and co-founder Francis Wolff died in 1971. Pearson opted to teach at Clark College in 1971, toured with Carmen McRae and Joe Williams through 1973, and eventually re-formed his big band during that time.

He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the 1970s, from which he died in 1980 at Atlanta Veterans Hospital.

<text>The Austin Maxi is a medium-sized, 5-door hatchback family car that was produced by Austin and later British Leyland between 1969 and 1981. It was the first British car to feature a hatchback body style.

Despite its practical design and remarkable space efficiency (it is shorter, narrower and lower than the sixth generation Ford Fiesta), the Maxi never came close to reaching its projected sales targets. Just under half a million were built over a 12 year period. BL management decisions involving the Maxi had significant knock-on effects to the rest of the car line-up. BL marketing decreed that the Maxi should be the only car in the range to feature a hatchback. This stance prevented the Austin Allegro and Princess models gaining hatchbacks despite those designs being capable of receiving them.

==History==

The Maxi (code name ADO14) was the last car designed under the British Motor Corporation (BMC) before it was incorporated into the new British Leyland group, and the last production car designed by famed designer Alec Issigonis. It was the first car to be launched by British Leyland.

Originally, under BMC&#x27;s plan for its new model range, which it had been developing since 1965, the Maxi was to have been called the &quot;Austin 1500&quot; on its spring 1969 launch, and a saloon version the &quot;Morris 1500&quot; was to follow in the autumn. However, upon the merger of BMC and Leyland the new management abandoned the four-door saloon notchback and developed the Morris Marina instead. The Marina, launched in April 1971, was a rear-wheel drive car available as a saloon, coupe or estate.

The new chairman Lord Stokes decided to also change the hatchback&#x27;s name to the Maxi in homage to the Mini of 10 years earlier. All Maxis were produced at the Cowley plant in Oxford, although the E-Series engines were made at a new factory at Cofton Hackett neighbouring Longbridge.

The Maxi was launched in Oporto, Portugal, on 24 April 1969, in a blaze of publicity; it was one of the first cars to appear on the BBC&#x27;s new car programme &quot;Wheelbase&quot;.

Underneath the Maxi&#x27;s practical and spacious bodyshell lay an all-new front-wheel drive chassis, which was interlinked with an innovative five-speed manual transmission; the fifth gear was another rarity on family cars in 1969 and one which many manufacturers did not adopt until more than a decade later. The gear selector suffered from notorious problems with its control linkage, especially in early models which had a cable-operated linkage prone to cable stretch and other problems. These were noted by autotesters such as Vicar in &quot;Today&#x27;s Driver&quot; (1969), who wrote: &quot;This is probably a good idea that just needs a little bit of working on.&quot; This criticism actually came as a result of a road test two months before the car officially went on sale. The later rod linkage was less problematic. All models were prone to problems brought on by the &quot;cogs in the sump&quot; layout, whereby the gearbox and engine shared a common oil supply. The clutch oil seal was also prone to leakage.

Power came from a , E-Series petrol engine which would later be used in other British Leyland products, such as the Austin Allegro. The 1750 and twin-carburettor 1750 HL models, added to the range in 1971, offered good performance by the standards of the era, with a top speed of , while the smaller-engine version could exceed .

Despite the new platform, the Maxi&#x27;s styling suffered from the decision to save tooling costs by re-using door panels from the Austin 1800 &quot;Landcrab&quot;, which gave the Maxi an unusually long wheelbase in relation to its length, coupled with the fact that the carried-over doors made the Maxi resemble a scaled down version of the 1800 (and the Austin 3-Litre, which also used the same doors). This design was by then five years old, at a time when curvaceous American-inspired &quot;coke bottle&quot; styling (typified by contemporaries such as the Ford Cortina Mk III and Hillman Avenger) was very much in vogue, contrasting sharply with the Maxi&#x27;s obviously mid-1960s looks. Another styling ambition for the car was a four-door saloon version, to compete directly with the Ford Cortina. A prototype was built, badged as a Morris, but it was not put into production, since the booted extension made the Maxi almost the same size as the 1800 model, which was itself replaced in March 1975 by the 18-22 series models (renamed the Princess soon after its launch). Also worthy of note is that the Maxi was voted the least stolen car in 1971 and 1972.

In Australia, owing to recently increased local content assembly tariffs which would have resulted in the Maxi being uneconomic to build, Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia developed in the UK the Morris Nomad, a hybrid utilizing the Maxi&#x27;s E-series engine/transmission and rear tailgate, fitted to the Morris 1100 body which was already being assembled in that country. For a short while the Nomad (under the Austin name) was exported to New Zealand and offered alongside the locally assembled Maxi.
The Maxi featured a spacious interior, comfortable passenger accommodation, competitive prices and reasonable running costs. It was let down by a dull interior and poor build quality, although it was not as notorious for its failings as the Austin Allegro and Morris Marina were during the 1970s.

The Maxi had several rivals during the 1970s, including the Volkswagen Passat (1973) and Chrysler Alpine (1975), although its best-selling rivals from Ford and Vauxhall did not produce a hatchback until the early 1980s.

One unusual feature of this car was that the rear seat back, as well as folding forward as in a conventional hatchback, also folded back. In combination with fully-reclining front seats, this gave satisfactory, if spartan, sleeping accommodation.

Towards the end of the Maxi&#x27;s life, in 1980, a lightly revised model was marketed as the &quot;Maxi 2&quot;, although by now sales were declining and a new car to succeed the Allegro and Maxi was being developed. Its launch was delayed by the extra investment required to develop the Austin Metro, launched in October 1980.

===End of production===
On 8 July 1981, the Austin Maxi&#x27;s 12-year production run came to an end. Its replacement, the Austin Maestro, which also replaced the smaller Allegro, was introduced in March 1983. Shortly after the Maxi&#x27;s demise, BL met the demand for a larger family hatchback by revamping the Princess and renaming it the Austin Ambassador, although this was a short-lived model which only lasted until 1984, when the Austin Montego was launched. This completed BL&#x27;s rationalisation, as it now had just one model competing in this market sector, whereas the Maxi had been one of three designs competing in a sector of the market which had been led by the Ford Cortina.

The Maxi production lines at Cowley were taken over by production of the Triumph Acclaim, which was launched in October 1981.

Despite its practical design and remarkable space efficiency (it is shorter, narrower and lower than the sixth generation Ford Fiesta), the Maxi never came close to reaching its projected sales targets. BL management decisions involving the Maxi had significant knock-on effects to the rest of the car line-up. BL marketing decreed that the Maxi should be the only car in the range to feature a hatchback. This stance prevented the Austin Allegro and Princess models gaining hatchbacks despite those designs being capable of receiving them. The policy was discontinued with the arrival of the Rover SD1 in 1976, and the fast-growing popularity of hatchbacks during the 1970s and 1980s saw British Leyland launch a raft of new hatchback models. The Austin Metro, launched in 1980, was only available as a hatchback, as was the 1983 Austin Maestro.

==Popular culture==

On 1 July 1969, John Lennon crashed a white Maxi on the single track A838 road near Loch Eriboll in the Highlands of Scotland. He was on his way to visit his uncle in Durness with Yoko Ono, his son Julian and Yoko&#x27;s daughter Kyoko. Originally they had set off from Tittenhurst Park, his home near Ascot in his Mini Cooper, however it soon became apparent that it was too small for them to drive all the way to Scotland, so they stayed overnight at his relatives&#x27; home in Liverpool. From there, he rang Apple Records and arranged for a driver to bring the &quot;staff&quot; car; a recently acquired Snowberry White Austin Maxi registered RLA 888G. It featured a full-length white webasto roof and also had a silver apple mounted on the radio speaker top of the front fascia. The following morning, Ono and Lennon transferred all of their luggage over to the Maxi and his driver took the Mini back to Tittenhurst, and the four set off north again to Northern Scotland; stopping briefly in Windermere and Edinburgh.

Whilst driving along the narrow A838 road, Lennon panicked when he saw another car approaching him and sent the Maxi headlong into a ditch. While the children escaped relatively unhurt, Lennon received a gash to his forehead and Ono injured her back, resulting in a hospital stay in Golspie&#x27;s Lawson Memorial Hospital for five days where he was treated by Dr. Michael Simpson. After they returned to London, Lennon arranged for the Maxi to be placed on a plinth outside his Tittenhurst home as an homage to their luck, where it stayed for the next few years, during which time Julian took the silver apple from the dash and kept it as a keepsake, though the vehicle was auctioned many years later. Lennon also had its steering wheel removed and it was hung up in his billiard room in the house. When Lennon and Ono finally left the UK for the United States, Lennon sold Tittenhurst to friend and former bandmate Ringo Starr who had the Maxi scrapped. In October 2016, James Walshe, the deputy editor of Practical Classics car magazine retraced Lennon&#x27;s journey in his 1969 Maxi. The feature later received a top award as &#x27;Best Feature&#x27; at the 2017 Bauer Awards.

In 1972, a married couple escaped the Soviet quarter of Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie in the back of a Maxi. Once over into the western sector, the British Royal Military Police and the West German Polizei were so surprised that two people could fit into a Maxi&#x27;s boot, that it was then taken up by Leyland West Germany and re-created in a television advert shown across West Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
Also in 1972, at the Earl&#x27;s Court Motor Show a competition was staged by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the Institute of British Coachbuilders and Motor Manufactures (later incorporated into the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders) to design a futuristic concept car based on a Maxi. The winning design was by a young designer, Chris Field, and the prize was to have his design on paper turned into reality. The &quot;Aquila&quot; was constructed by Woodhall Nicolson of Halifax with help from Lucas, Smiths (Motor Accessory Division &amp; Radiomobile) and Triplex. The resultant car was exhibited at the 1973 show and then given to Field.

From 1975-80, British Leyland supplied the Lawn Tennis Association every year with official &quot;Wimbledon&quot; Maxis. These were standard single carburettor 1750s but fitted with HL velour seat trim and extra sound proofing. Afterwards, they were sold through local Surrey dealers as ex-demonstration cars.

In 1991, punk revival band Fabulous used a Maxi as their &quot;Fab-Mobile&quot; decked out in Punk-art graffiti. It also made an appearance in a video of The Farm&#x27;s cover version of The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;. The 1750 was registered as FRK 315T and according to the DVLA website was last taxed in April 1993.

The Maxi, grumbled AC/DC singer Brian Johnson, &quot;was like a matchbox on steroids. The only reason you knew it was a car was cos it had a steering wheel. It was the most basic form of frickin&#x27; transport! But it could have been worse. My next-door neighbour had a Lada.&quot;

==Timeline==


*May 1969: Introduction of the Austin Maxi 1500 5-door hatchback with transversely-mounted 1485 cc E Series engine and 5-speed manual gearbox driving the front wheels, independent suspension with hydrolastic shock absorbers (often referred to as the &quot;cable-change&quot; models).
*October 1970: Revisions: redesigned front grille with centre badge, bodyside strips, gearchange rods (instead of cables), better sound insulation, new seat facings, all-new veneered wood dash design and smaller steering wheel. Introduction of the Austin Maxi 1750 with larger 1748 cc engine and revisions as for Maxi 1500. Assembly by IMV in Yugoslavia also commenced in 1970.
*1971: Alternator fitted to all UK models, revised direction indicator circuit, matt finish wood dash, plastic engine shield now black instead of cream. 1750 now has its own gold/yellow chequered grill badge.
*1972: Introduction of the Austin Maxi 1750 HL, with twin SU HS6 carburettor version of the 1748 cc engine, which gave a higher output of at 5250 rpm. Other additional features for the HL were 165 x 13 radial ply tyres, black grille with chrome upper and lower strips and red &quot;HL&quot; motif, red chequered front badge, front bumper under-riders, chrome exhaust trim, black rimmed hub caps, body coloured mouldings along the sides and rear, electric windscreen washers, 3-spoke alloy steering wheel with leather-bound rim, padded vinyl dashboard, dipping rear view mirror, vanity mirror on passenger sun visor, front door pockets, simulated wooden gear knob and brushed nylon upholstery.
*1973: Hazard flashers introduced on UK models. In common with the Austin/Morris 1800, body changes to the Maxi simplify production and reduce costs (the A posts are no longer lead loaded).
*1974: Optional 4-speed automatic transmission available on 1750 and (from May 1979) 1750 HL.
*1975: Fuel tank enlarged, revisions to the rear squab bed adaption facility. All models now feature cigar lighter and heated rear window as standard.
*1976: All export LHD models now designated &quot;Maxi HL&quot; with specification similar to UK 1750 HL but without twin carburettor or three-spoke alloy steering wheel.
*1977: Austin name officially dropped by BL under recommendation by the Ryder Report. Model now officially designated &quot;Maxi&quot;. The only noticeable difference was the rear tailgate badge along with the handbooks, so general public and dealers unofficially still called it the same name. Dual circuit brakes now fitted to UK spec cars.
*1978: All models now have Hydragas suspension instead of the Hydrolastic system which required a revised front subframe, and all models now feature electric windscreen washers. The HL loses its three-spoke steering wheel and a walnut finish dash replaces its padded dash.
*May 1979: Introduction of the Maxi 1750 HLS with walnut dash and twin carburettor engine previously restricted to the HL (the HL now with the single carburettor and wood dash). All models now feature the same copper-coloured front grill badge, black wipers and door mirrors, the rear tailgate badge is now below the trim line, also revised illuminated switches, cigar lighter and revised windscreen wiper control instrumentation. The 1500/1750 now have &#x27;Marle&#x27; fabric seat facings replacing the previous PVC &quot;basketweave&quot; leatherette. Single rear fog-light now fitted across the range.
*Dec 1979: Maxi 1500 discontinued.
*Aug 1980: Introduction of the Maxi 2 range in 1750 L, 1750 HL and 1750 HLS variants. All models feature revisions including new bumpers incorporating indicators (front) and reversing lights (rear), new side repeaters, full cover plastic wheel trims and broader side moulding inserts. Inside the instrument bezels are now in matt black, the switchgear is again revised, the headlight switch is now on the steering column and there is a choke warning light. The L replaced the previous Base model and added LM/MW push button radio, nylon trim, door bins, laminated windscreen and walnut veneer dashboard. The HL gained intermittent screen wipe, velour seats, tinted glass and extra sound insulation. The HLS gained a burr walnut veneer dashboard. However, LHD export Maxi 2s were still referred to as &#x27;Austin&#x27; Maxis in sales literature, only one version being available, the single carburettor HL, though unlike the UK spec cars it did not feature a radio as standard.
*1981: Chrome bumpers replaced by matt black.

*July 1981: Last Maxi 2 rolls off production line, its place at Cowley taken by the new Triumph Acclaim. The last Maxi, a champagne L model, is now owned by the British Motor Museum, Gaydon.

<doc id="1058531" wikidata="Q1304639" url="?curid=1058531" title="Guttman scale">
<text>In the analysis of multivariate observations designed to assess subjects with respect to an attribute, a Guttman scale (named after Louis Guttman) is a single (unidimensional) ordinal scale for the assessment of the attribute, from which the original observations may be reproduced. The discovery of a Guttman scale in data depends on their multivariate distribution&#x27;s conforming to a particular structure (see below). Hence, a Guttman scale is a &quot;hypothesis&quot; about the structure of the data, formulated with respect to a specified attribute and a specified population and cannot be constructed for any given set of observations. Contrary to a widespread belief, a Guttman scale is not limited to dichotomous variables and does not necessarily determine an order among the variables. But if variables are all dichotomous, the variables are indeed ordered by their sensitivity in recording the assessed attribute, as illustrated by Example 1.

==Deterministic model==
Example 1: Dichotomous variables

A Guttman scale may be hypothesized for the following five questions that concern the attribute &quot;acceptance of social contact with immigrants&quot; (based on the Bogardus social distance scale), presented to a suitable population:

# Would you accept immigrants as residents in your country? (No=0; Yes=1)
# Would you accept immigrants as residents in your town? (No=0; Yes=1)
# Would you accept immigrants as residents in your neighborhood? (No=0; Yes=1)
# Would you accept immigrants as next-door neighbors? (No=0; Yes=1)
# Would you accept an immigrant as your child&#x27;s spouse? (No=0; Yes=1)

A positive response by a particular respondent to any question in this list, suggests positive responses by that respondent to all preceding questions in this list. Hence one could expect to obtain only the responses listed in the shaded part (columns 1–5) of Table 1.
 Table 1. Hypothesized responses to the five social distance variables form a Guttman scale (a cumulative scale)

Every row in the shaded part of Table 1 (columns 1–5) is the response &quot;profile&quot; of any number (≥ 0) of respondents. Every profile in this table indicates acceptance of immigrants in all senses indicated by the previous profile, plus an additional sense in which immigrants are accepted. If, in a large number of observations, only the profiles listed in Table 1 are observed, then the Guttman scale hypothesis is supported, and the values of the scale (last column of Table 1) have the following properties:

# They assess the strength of the attribute &quot;acceptance of social contact with immigrants&quot;; 
# They reproduce the original observations. (For example, a respondent&#x27;s scale score of 2 implies that that respondent responded positively to questions 1 and 2 and negatively to questions 3, 4, and 5.)

Guttman scale, if supported by data, is useful for efficiently assessing subjects (respondents, testees or any collection of investigated objects) on a one-dimensional scale with respect to the specified attribute. Typically, Guttman scales are found with respect to attributes that are narrowly defined.

While other scaling techniques (e.g., Likert scale) produce a single scale by summing up respondents&#x27; scores—a procedure that assumes, often without justification, that all observed variables have equal weights — Guttman scale avoids weighting the observed variables; thus &#x27;respecting&#x27; data for what they are. If a Guttman scale is confirmed, the measurement of the attribute is &quot;intrinsically&quot; one-dimensional; the unidimensionality is not forced by summation or averaging. This feature renders it appropriate for the construction of replicable scientific theories and meaningful measurements, as explicated in facet theory. 

== Ordinal variables ==
Given a data set of &quot;N&quot; subjects observed with respect to &quot;n&quot; ordinal variables, each having any finite number (≥2) of numerical categories ordered by increasing strength of a pre-specified attribute, let &quot;aij&quot; be the score obtained by subject &quot;i&quot; on variable &quot;j&quot;, and define the list of scores that subject &quot;i&quot; obtained on the &quot;n&quot; variables, ai=ai1...ain , to be the &quot;profile&quot; of subject &quot;i&quot;. (The number of categories may be different in different variables; and the order of the variables in the profiles is not important but should be fixed).

Define:

Two profiles, a&quot;s&quot; and a&quot;t&quot; are &quot;equal&quot;, denoted a&quot;s&quot;=a&quot;t&quot;, iff &quot;asj=atj&quot; for all &quot;j&quot;=1...&quot;n&quot;

Profile &quot;as&quot; is &quot;greater&quot; than Profile &quot;at&quot;, denoted &quot;as&gt;at&quot;, iff &quot;asj ≥ atj&quot; for all &quot;j&quot;=1...&quot;n&quot; and a&quot;sj&#x27;&quot; &gt; &quot;atj&#x27;&quot; for at least one variable, &quot;j&quot;&#x27;.

Profiles &quot;as&quot; and &quot;at&quot; are &quot;comparable&quot;, denoted &quot;asSat&quot;, iff &quot;as=at&quot;; or &quot;as&gt;at&quot;; or &quot;at&gt;as&quot;

Profiles &quot;as&quot; and &quot;at&quot; are &quot;incomparable&quot;, denoted &quot;as$at&quot;, if they are not comparable (that is, for at least one variable, &quot;j&quot;&#x27;, &quot;asj&#x27; &gt; atj&#x27;&quot; and for at least one other variable&quot;, j&quot;&quot;, &quot;atj&quot; &gt; asj&quot;&quot;.

For data sets where the categories of all variables are similarly ordered numerically (from high to low or from low to high) with respect to a given attribute, Guttman scale is defined simply thus:

&quot;Definition:&quot; Guttman scale is a data set in which all profile-pairs are comparable.

=== Example: Non-dichotomous variables ===
Consider the following four variables that assess arithmetic skills among a population P of pupils:

V1: Can pupil (p) perform addition of numbers? No=1; Yes, but only of two-digit numbers=2; Yes=3.

V2: Does pupil (p) know the (1-10) multiplication table?  No=1; Yes=2.

V3: Can pupil (p) perform multiplication of numbers? No=1; Yes, but only of two-digit numbers=2; Yes=3.

V4: Can pupil (p) perform long division? No=1; Yes=2.

Data collected for the above four variables among a population of school children may be hypothesized to exhibit the Guttman scale shown below in Table 2:

Table 2. Data of the four ordinal arithmetic skill variables are hypothesized to form a Guttman scale 

The set profiles hypothesized to occur (shaded part in Table 2) illustrates the defining feature of the Guttman scale, namely, that any pair of profiles are comparable. Here too, if the hypothesis is confirmed, a single scale-score reproduces a subject&#x27;s responses in all the variables observed.

Any ordered set of numbers could serve as scale. In this illustration we chose the sum of profile-scores. According to facet theory, only in data that conform to a Guttman scale such a summation may be justified.

== Reproducibility ==
In practice, perfect (&quot;deterministic&quot;) Guttman scales are rare, but approximate ones have been found in specific populations with respect to attributes such as religious practices, narrowly defined domains of knowledge, specific skills, and ownership of household appliances. When data do not conform to a Guttman scale, they may either represent a Guttman scale with noise (and treated stochastically), or they may have a more complex structure requiring multiple scaling for identifying the scales intrinsic to them.

The extent to which a data set conforms to a Guttman scale can be estimated from the coefficient of reproducibility of which there are a few versions, depending on statistical assumptions and limitations. Guttman&#x27;s original definition of the reproducibility coefficient, CR is simply 1 minus the ratio of the number of errors to the number of entries in the data set. And, to ensure that there is a range of responses (not the case if all respondents only endorsed one item) the coefficient of scalability is used.

In Guttman scaling is found the beginnings of item response theory which, in contrast to classical test theory, acknowledges that items in questionnaires do not all have the same level of difficulty. Non-deterministic (i.e., stochastic) models have been developed such as the Mokken scale and the Rasch model. Guttman scale has been generalized to the theory and procedures of &quot;multiple scaling&quot; which identifies the minimum number of scales needed for satisfactory reproducibility.

As a procedure that ties substantive contents with logical aspects of data, Guttman scale heralded the advent of facet theory developed by Louis Guttman and his associates.

== Guttman scale in qualitative variables ==
Guttman&#x27;s original definition of a &quot;scale&quot; allows also for the exploratory scaling analysis of qualitative variables (nominal variables, or ordinal variables that do not necessarily belong to a pre-specified common attribute). This definition of Guttman scale relies on the prior definition of a &quot;simple function&quot;.

For a totally ordered set &quot;X&quot;, say, 1,2...,&quot;m&quot; , and another finite set, &quot;Y&quot;, with &quot;k&quot; elements &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot;, a function from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is a &quot;simple function&quot; if &quot;X&quot; can be partitioned into &quot;k&quot; intervals which are in a one-to-one correspondence with the values of &quot;Y&quot; .

A Guttman scale may then be defined for a data set of &quot;n&quot; variables, with the &quot;j&quot;th variable having &quot;kj&quot; (qualitative, not necessarily ordered) categories, thus:

Definition: &quot;Guttman scale&quot; is a data set for which there exists an ordinal variable, &quot;X&quot;, with a finite number &quot;m&quot; of categories, say, 1...,&quot;m&quot; with &quot;m&quot;≥ max&quot;j&quot;(&quot;kj&quot;) and a permutation of subjects&#x27; profiles such that each variable in the data set is a simple function of &quot;X&quot;.

Despite its seeming elegance and appeal for exploratory research, this definition has not been sufficiently studied or applied.

<doc id="1058538" wikidata="Q7091247" url="?curid=1058538" title="On a Pale Horse">
<text>On a Pale Horse is a fantasy novel by Piers Anthony, first published in 1983. It is the first of eight books in the &quot;Incarnations of Immortality&quot; series. The book focuses on Zane, a photographer about to commit suicide who instead kills Death and must assume his office. The book spawned a five-issue comic series, released by Innovation Publishing from 1991 to 1993, but Innovation went out of business before releasing the sixth and final issue. It was also the inspiration for the television series, &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, which worked on the premise that there are multiple Grim Reapers working the planet.

==Plot summary==
In the 1980s, Zane is living a pathetic life without money or employment. When a magic gem merchant cheats Zane out of an opportunity for romance, Zane decides to take his own life. As he starts to pull the trigger, he sees the spectre of Death (Thanatos) advancing on him. Startled, he pulls the gun from his own head and shoots Death right between the eyes. He is then visited by a woman who introduces herself as Fate, who insists that Zane must now assume the position of the man he has killed, since whoever kills Death must become the new Death. As Zane makes his way downstairs, he gets his first view of a pale limousine with the license plate reading &quot;Mortis&quot;, his Death Steed (Death rides a pale horse) who can assume the form of a pale boat, a plane, or a pale limousine, as well as the form of a pale horse. Fate then departs and leaves Zane in the care of Chronos, the Incarnation of Time, who then instructs Zane how to use his deathwatch, how Mortis changes form, how to use other instruments of the office, and exactly what his new duties are. This entails residing in Purgatory and visiting Earth to collect the souls of humans who are in a close balance of good and evil and cannot determine their eternal destination (Heaven or Hell) without help.

In the course of learning the job, he discovers that his coming into the office of Death was not accidental, but was manipulated by a powerful magician (Cedric Kaftan Jr.). Despite being a mortal, this magician has strong ties to the other Incarnations from Purgatory and reveals to Zane that the Incarnation of Fate arranged Zane&#x27;s destiny for the magician&#x27;s purpose. There is a prophecy which states that Luna Kaftan, the magician&#x27;s daughter, is destined to go into politics and thwart the schemes of Satan, the Incarnation of Evil. Luna Kaftan is thus a target for the forces of Hell and is in need of supernatural protection. The magician, who has done a great deal of research, feels that Zane is the best candidate for the Incarnation of Death to fall in love with Luna and thus want to protect her.

The only way for the magician Kaftan to meet with Death without Satan&#x27;s knowledge is to die with his soul in balance. The magician chooses to sacrifice his own life to introduce Zane to Luna and explain to Zane the circumstances which brought him into the office of Death.

The dead magician&#x27;s plans, however, seem to go awry. Due to manipulation by Satan, Luna is also destined to die before she can fulfill the prophecy. The magician had used too much black magic for his soul to be in balance. To bring it into balance before committing suicide, he has transferred the excess evil on his soul to Luna&#x27;s soul, whom he has assumed to be innocent of evil. However, Luna has a burden of evil on her soul already, and her father&#x27;s scheme has put her on the course to Hell. To correct this, she volunteers to switch places with one of Death&#x27;s other clients. By sacrificing her own life to save another, she manages to balance the evil on her soul.

Her actions play right into Satan&#x27;s trap, who does not care whether she goes to Heaven or Hell, only that she dies and is no longer a threat to his plots. However, Zane has already fallen in love with Luna by this time, just like the magician had planned, and he refuses to take the soul of the woman he loves.

Now the motives behind the magician&#x27;s choice of Zane are made clear to him when the other four Incarnations (Time, Fate, War, and Nature) from Purgatory approach him and explain that they were all in on the plan. The previous Death could not be manipulated into betraying the duties of his office for love, so the Incarnations of Immortality decided to replace him with a young, stubborn man like Zane, who could.

Because Luna&#x27;s soul is next in the queue, Zane cannot take the souls of other mortals until he deals with hers. He refuses to do so, thereby going on strike and leaving dying mortals in agony, unable to be released by death. As this is not to Satan&#x27;s advantage, he first tries to bribe Zane, then intimidate him into going back to work.

Zane, however, has had a conversation with Gaea, the Incarnation of Nature, who has demonstrated to him the absolute power each Incarnation wields in its own sphere of influence. Zane eventually realises that the office of Death is unassailable by Satan and that he cannot be harmed within the sphere of that office. As an Incarnation, Satan himself has a soul and is subject to Zane&#x27;s dominion. The conflict ends in a draw and Satan has no choice but to admit defeat.

With Satan&#x27;s plot exposed, Purgatory changes Luna&#x27;s destiny and she is free to return to life. Zane lifts his strike, and with Luna under his protection, Satan can no longer interfere with her fate through the means of death.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #66, and stated that &quot;One reason why this book works: matters of life and death &quot;deserve&quot; such agonizing - the Xanth books waste it on white lies or table manners. Another reason: the mechanics of magic and the after-life are fresh and inventive - whereas Xanth has been worn smooth. Not great literature, but good fun.&quot;

==&quot;The Liberati&quot;==

Richard Mathews says that &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot; &quot;explores fantasy&#x27;s (and Anthony&#x27;s) unique ability to embody abstractions. In the novel, an incarnation of Death engages in symbolic interactions written with the goal of helping readers come to terms with the inevitable end of life.&quot;

Snorri states that Högne and his son Hildur often made raids into the Swedish provinces killing many of Ingjald&#x27;s men, and that he ruled his kingdom until he died.

==&quot;Volsunga saga&quot;==
In the &quot;Volsunga saga&quot;, the kings Högne and Granmar also appear. In this saga, Högne has a daughter Sigrun who he had promised to Granmar&#x27;s son Hothbrodd. However, Sigrun has a suitor, Helgi Hundingsbane who attacks Granmar. Högne&#x27;s forces joined Hothbrodd, but Helgi was victorious and Hothbrodd slain. Afterwards, Helgi married Sigrun.

==The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;==
Högne appears in two poems of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot; and &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, which tell a similar story to his appearance in &quot;Volsunga saga&quot;. However, the poems are more detailed. &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot; says that Högne has two sons, named Bragi and Dagr, and a brother named Sigarr. Bragi and Högne himself are killed by Helgi in the battle with Hǫðbroddr, but Dagr is spared when he surrenders and swears oaths to Helgi. Sigrún, Högne&#x27;s daughter who had initiated the slaughter (here also depicted as a valkyrie), weeps over her family&#x27;s deaths, but then marries Helgi. Later, Dagr prays to Odin to avenge Högne his father, and kills Helgi with a spear that Odin grants him.

<text>The Rover CityRover is a supermini car that was marketed by the former British manufacturer MG Rover under the Rover marque, between 2003 and 2005. Launched in the autumn of 2003, the car was a rebadged version of the Indian developed Tata Indica. Its performance was considered poor for a small car in contemporary road tests, and its lack of quality, poor road handling and high price were not well received. 

Production of the CityRover ceased in April 2005, along with the rest of the MG Rover range, when the company fell into administration.

==Technical details==
The CityRover was offered with only one engine: a Peugeot derived 1,405 cc (1.4 L) four cylinder, eight valve engine producing and . It could accelerate to 60 mph in 11.9 seconds and had a top speed of . 

The CityRover was manufactured by Tata Motors, at their factory in Pune, India. Alterations for the British market included new bumpers, Rover badge grille, 14&quot; wheels, and new suspension settings.

==Safety==
The high driving position and large glass area afforded drivers with good all-round visibility, while the rear lamps were mounted high up on the structure so other road users could see them more prominently. All doors were fitted with anti-intrusion bars, with child locks on the rear doors.

The steering column was collapsible, and a driver-side airbag was fitted as standard to all models, with a passenger airbag standard on the top trim level and available as an option on the entry-level and midrange trims. All seats had anti-submarine ramps and three-point seatbelts, with the front getting belt pretensioners and height-adjustable head restraints. ABS was included on &quot;style&quot; models.

==Criticism==

MG Rover was reported to be paying Tata £3,000 for each car and, with each model featuring a Rover corporate nose and revised suspension settings, the buying public was not impressed by the £6,495 starting price.

In May 2004, Rover refused to lend a CityRover to motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; to test it. In order to answer the question of &quot;just how bad could it be?&quot; James May went undercover and test drove one at a dealer while carrying a hidden camera. May went on to say, &quot;that is the worst car I have driven on this programme&quot;.

Sales were well short of MG Rover&#x27;s targets, so the CityRover was given an upgrade for the model year of 2005, with more standard equipment. In December 2004, prices were reduced by £900, confirming that the car&#x27;s previous prices had not been competitive.

According to car reviewer &quot;Parker&#x27;s&quot;, the CityRover was the worst rated Rover car from MG Rover, with a rating of two out of five. In October 2013, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the CityRover as number two behind the Perodua Kelisa on its list of &quot;The thirteen worst cars of the last twenty years.&quot;

<doc id="1058549" wikidata="Q4933026" url="?curid=1058549" title="Bob Kiley">
<text>Robert R. Kiley (September 16, 1935 – August 9, 2016) was an American public transit planner and supervisor known for his ability to rehabilitate transit systems experiencing serious problems. From 2001 to 2006 he was the initial commissioner of Transport for London, the public organisation that runs and maintains London&#x27;s public transport network.

Kiley also worked as a CIA agent, CEO of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, deputy mayor of Boston, chairman and CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and president and CEO of the New York City Partnership. He is credited as being the architect of the revival of Boston and New York&#x27;s ailing public transport systems in the 1970s and 1980s respectively.

Kiley unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Boston in 1983.

==Minneapolis, Boston and New York==
Kiley was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota and educated at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and went on to study at Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School. In 1963 he joined the Central Intelligence Agency. The BBC reported that although former colleagues say it would be incorrect to regard Bob Kiley as a &quot;spook,&quot; he did travel around the world in his role as manager of intelligence operations. He later served as executive assistant to agency director Richard Helms.

Kiley left the CIA in 1970 and embarked on a career in management. He first worked as an assistant director at the Police Foundation in Washington D.C. Two years later, he became deputy mayor of Boston, a position he held for three years. During his time as deputy mayor, he prioritised public safety during the court-mandated desegregation of schools. In 1975 Kiley took on two new roles – one as adjunct professor of public management at Boston University and the other as chairman and CEO of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. He left the MBTA in 1979 and became a vice president at the Management Analysis Center (now part of Cap Gemini). 

In 1983 Kiley moved to New York City to become the chairman and CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). He remained in the position until 1990 and in his time in the role secured state funding to the tune of $16bn to revitalise the railroads, buses and subways in the MTA region. Gene Russianoff, of the New York Straphangers Campaign, said that the money was spent wisely – &quot;Even normally grudging New Yorkers say he did a good job,&quot; Russianoff said. The clean-up campaign involving arresting fare dodgers and cleaning up graffiti is now regarded as a prelude to the citywide policy of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; enforced by Rudy Giuliani during his time as Mayor in the 1990s.

In 1991 Kiley became president of the New York construction company Fischbach Corporation. He briefly held the role of chairman before moving again to become president and CEO of the New York City Partnership in 1995. From 1994 to 1998 he was also principal of Kohlberg &amp; Company, a private equity investment house. Kiley&#x27;s Transport for London biography notes that Kiley was also &quot;Member of the Council on Foreign Relations, board member of the Salzburg Seminar, the American Repertory Theater, MONY Group Inc, the Princeton Review Inc and Edison Schools, Inc. He was on the Advisory Board of the Harvard University Center for State and Local Government&quot;.

==London==
In October 2000, Kiley was recruited to become the first commissioner of Transport for London (TfL), London&#x27;s new integrated transport body, reporting directly to the mayor of London. Following his appointment, Kiley was criticised by the press due to his £4m four-year contract, the use of a £2m grace and favour property in Belgravia, and his expatriate status. He was regarded by the press as &quot;a strange bedfellow&quot; for Ken Livingstone, the socialist elected in 2000 as London&#x27;s first mayor. However, Livingstone considered Kiley &quot;the best candidate,&quot; with very similar views on transportation to himself. In January 2001 Kiley became Chairman of London Regional Transport (the public body appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport to run London&#x27;s Underground network of trains), replacing Sir Malcolm Bates.

Livingstone&#x27;s and Kiley&#x27;s were opposed to the government&#x27;s plans for public-private partnerships (PPP) to run London Underground. Kiley was sacked as chairman of London Regional Transport in July 2001 amid repeated clashes with his boss, Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, and was replaced by Malcolm Bates, who returned to lead the organisation. Remaining as commissioner of Transport for London, he and Livingstone took the government to court in trying to prevent PPP. They failed, and in January 2003 two separate private companies – Metronet and Tube Lines – took control of maintaining various tube lines. In July 2003 powers for running the rest of the Tube network, including manning and maintaining the stations, was transferred to TfL and London Regional Transport became defunct. Kiley welcomed the opportunity to take greater control over the running of the Tube, but warned that he felt he would be hampered by PPP: 

Subsequently, the PPPs collapsed due to financial difficulties in the late 2000s.

In November 2005, Kiley announced that he would be standing down in January 2006, after five years in the job, albeit three years earlier than expected. Kiley was credited as helping Livingstone bring in the London congestion charge, introducing the Oyster card payment system, as well as improving the quality and frequency of Buses in London. He was paid almost £2 million in a settlement for standing down, and remained as a £3,200-a-day consultant. In a controversial interview with the London Evening Standard, he admitted he was unsure exactly what he did to deserve his consultancy fee, and denied rumours of a rift with Livingstone. He also revealed his struggles with alcoholism, exacerbated by overwork and the loss of his family in a car accident, followed by the death of his father shortly afterwards. He was replaced as Commissioner by Peter Hendy in February 2006.

==Personal life==
Kiley&#x27;s first wife and two children died in a car accident in 1974. He was married to his second wife, Rona, at the time of his death. They have two sons.

<doc id="1058552" wikidata="Q7057217" url="?curid=1058552" title="North Wessex Downs">
<text>The North Wessex Downs are an area of chalk downland landscapes located in the English counties of Berkshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. The North Wessex Downs has been designated as a National Landscape (formerly known as Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or AONB) since 1972.

The name &quot;North Wessex Downs&quot; is not a traditional one, the area covered being better known by various overlapping local names, including the Berkshire Downs, the North Hampshire Downs, the White Horse Hills, the Lambourn Downs, the Marlborough Downs, the Vale of Pewsey and Savernake Forest.

== Topography ==
The AONB covers an area of some . It takes the form of a horseshoe, with the open end facing east, surrounding the town of Newbury and the River Kennet catchment area. The northern arm reaches as far east as the suburbs of Reading in mid-Berkshire and as far north as Didcot in South Oxfordshire, whilst the southern arm extends to Basingstoke in northern Hampshire. To the west, the AONB reaches as far as Calne and Devizes. The highest points are the 297 m (974 ft) summit of Walbury Hill, situated southeast of Hungerford in West Berkshire (and the highest point in southern England east of the Mendip Hills), and the Milk Hill-Tan Hill plateau northeast of Devizes in central Wiltshire, at 295 m (968 ft) above sea level.
At its northeast extreme, Lardon Chase within the North Wessex Downs AONB faces across the Goring Gap to the Chilterns AONB on the other side of the River Thames. From here working anti-clockwise around the horseshoe, the Berkshire Downs have a steep scarp slope facing north over the Vale of White Horse and a gentler dip slope facing south into the valley of the Kennet. This area includes the horse-racing village of Lambourn and is hence sometimes known as the Lambourn Downs. Beyond the town of Marlborough the downs (now called the Marlborough Downs) sweep in a semicircle to the south around the headwaters of the River Kennet, with the Vale of Pewsey cutting through these downs carrying the headwaters of the Hampshire River Avon. Here too can be found the wooded area of Savernake Forest. Finally, the highest stretch of the Downs runs east along the Berkshire-Hampshire border on the opposite side of the River Kennet from the Berkshire Downs. Again the scarp slope is to the north (facing down in the valley of the Kennet) and the dip slope is to the south into Hampshire.

== Geology and natural history ==

The downland is part of the Southern England Chalk Formation which runs from Dorset in the west to Kent in the east and also includes the Dorset Downs, Purbeck Hills, Cranborne Chase, Wiltshire Downs, Salisbury Plain, the Isle of Wight, Chiltern Hills and the North and South Downs.

The area is a site of scientific interest in numerous fields and has an internationally important habitat for early gentian. Geologically, its chalk downs, dry valleys and sarsen outcrops are of note, the last in the area around Marlborough providing material for many of the Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in the area such as Avebury Henge.

== Economy ==
Horse racing forms a major industry in the area, largely because of the good quality turf that comes with the chalk underlay, and much of upland area is made over to gallops and other training areas. Several of the upland villages, and especially the large village of Lambourn, are home to major racing stables. Other villages with strong horse racing connections include Beckhampton, Kingsclere and West Ilsley. The term steeplechase originated in this area, a steeplechase originally being a race between two villages, navigated by reference to the church steeples visible across the rolling downs.

On the south-east arm of the AONB can be found Watership Down where the book &quot;Watership Down&quot; by Richard Adams is set, to the north of the small market town of Whitchurch, Hampshire.

Significant parts of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; by Thomas Hardy are set on and in the villages connected to the Berkshire Downs.

== AONB Council of Partners ==
The Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was designated in 1972. It is managed by a Council of Partners whose members are:
* Local Authorities: Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, Hampshire County Council, Vale of White Horse District Council, West Berkshire Council, Wiltshire Council, Oxfordshire County Council, South Oxfordshire District Council, Swindon Borough Council and Test Valley Borough Council
* Representing the interests of nature conservation: Natural England, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and Action for the River Kennet
* Representing the interests of the historic environment: Council for British Archaeology and English Heritage
* Representing the interests of farming and rural business: Axis Farming, Country Land and Business Association, Forestry Commission, Government Office for the South East and the National Farmers&#x27; Union
* Representing the interests of communities and parishes: Connecting Communities in Berkshire, the Friends of Pang, Kennet and Lambourn Valleys, Whitchurch Town Parish Council and Hungerford Town Council

<text>The CK722 was the first low-cost junction transistor available to the general public. It was a PNP germanium small-signal unit. Developed by Norman Krim, it was introduced by Raytheon in early 1953 for $7.60 each; the price was reduced to $3.50 in late 1954 and to $0.99 in 1956. Norm Krim selected Radio Shack to sell the CK721 and CK722 through their catalog. Krim had a long-standing personal and business relationship with Radio Shack. The CK722s were selected &quot;fall out&quot; from the Raytheon&#x27;s premium-priced CK721 (which are fallouts from CK718 hearing-aid transistors). Raytheon actively encouraged hobbyists with design contests and advertisements.

In the 1950s and 1960s, hundreds of hobbyist electronics projects based around the CK722 transistor were published in popular books and magazines. Raytheon also participated in expanding the role of the CK721/CK722 as a hobbyist electronics device by publishing &quot;Transistor Applications&quot; and &quot;Transistor Applications Volume 2&quot; during the mid-1950s.


== Construction ==
The original CK722 were direct fallouts from CK718 hearing-aid transistors that did not meet specifications. These fallouts were later stamped with CK721 or CK722 numbers based on gain, noise and other dynamic characteristics. Early CK722s were plastic-encapsulated and had a black body. As Raytheon improved its production of hearing-aid transistors with the introduction of the smaller CK78x series, the body of the CK721/CK722s was changed to a metal case. Raytheon, however, kept the basic body size and used a unique method by taking the smaller CK78x rejects and inserting it into the larger body and sealing it. The first metal-cased CK721/CK722s were blue, and the later ones were silver. More details of this can be found in Jack Ward&#x27;s website, Semiconductor Museum or the CK722 Museum, see external link reference below.

==Engineers associated with the CK722 ==

=== Norman Krim – father of the transistor hobbyist market ===
In the late 1930s, Norm Krim, then an engineer for Raytheon, was looking into subminiature tubes for use in consumer applications such as hearing aids and pocket radios. Krim&#x27;s team developed the CK501X subminiature amplifier tube that could run on penlight A type batteries or small 22.5 V B-type batteries.

Following World War II, Krim was interested in developing the first pocket vacuum tube radio. Raytheon approved, and a team headed by Krim designed a set of subminiature tubes specifically for radios (2E32, 2E36, 2E42 and 2G22). Raytheon’s acquisition of Belmont Radio proved prescient, and the result was the Belmont Boulevard in 1945. The radio did not sell well, and Raytheon took a loss. Despite this setback, Krim remained at the company and shifted his attention to the newly developed transistor.

===Carl David Todd – participant in the CK722 design contest ===
Carl Todd, a hobbyist and later engineer in GE’s transistor division, placed 6th in Raytheon&#x27;s CK722 design contest. His hobby work with this early transistor inspired him to pursue electrical engineering as a career. As an engineer, he helped develop the 2N107 transistor, GE&#x27;s alternative to the CK722.

<doc id="1058555" wikidata="Q1051200" url="?curid=1058555" title="Schema (psychology)">
<text>In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (: schemata or schemas) describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them. It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information, such as a mental schema or conceptual model. Schemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged, even in the face of contradictory information. Schemata can help in understanding the world and the rapidly changing environment. People can organize new perceptions into schemata quickly as most situations do not require complex thought when using schema, since automatic thought is all that is required.

People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a framework for future understanding. Examples of schemata include mental models, social schemas, stereotypes, social roles, scripts, worldviews, heuristics, and archetypes. In Piaget&#x27;s theory of development, children construct a series of schemata, based on the interactions they experience, to help them understand the world.

==History==
&quot;Schema&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;schēmat&quot; or &quot;schēma&quot;, meaning &quot;figure&quot;.

Prior to its use in psychology, the term &quot;schema&quot; had primarily seen use in philosophy. For instance, &quot;schemata&quot; (especially &quot;transcendental schemata&quot;) are crucial to the architectonic system devised by Immanuel Kant in his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.

Early developments of the idea in psychology emerged with the gestalt psychologists (founded originally by Max Wertheimer) and Jean Piaget. The term &quot;schéma&quot; was introduced by Piaget in 1923. In Piaget&#x27;s later publications, action (operative or procedural) &quot;schémes&quot; were distinguished from figurative (representational) &quot;schémas&quot;, although together they may be considered a schematic duality. In subsequent discussions of Piaget in English, &quot;schema&quot; was often a mistranslation of Piaget&#x27;s original French &quot;schéme&quot;. The distinction has been of particular importance in theories of embodied cognition and ecological psychology.

This concept was first described in the works of British psychologist Frederic Bartlett, who drew on the term body schema used by neurologist Henry Head in 1932. In 1952, Jean Piaget, who was credited with the first cognitive development theory of schemas, popularized this ideology. By 1977, it was expanded into schema theory by educational psychologist Richard C. Anderson. Since then, other terms have been used to describe schema such as &quot;frame&quot;, &quot;scene&quot;, and &quot;script&quot;.

==Schematic processing==
Through the use of schemata, a heuristic technique to encode and retrieve memories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous processing. People can quickly organize new perceptions into schemata and act without effort. The process, however, is not always accurate, and people may develop illusory correlations, which is the tendency to form inaccurate or unfounded associations between categories, especially when the information is distinctive.

Nevertheless, schemata can influence and hamper the uptake of new information, such as when existing stereotypes, giving rise to limited or biased discourses and expectations, lead an individual to &quot;see&quot; or &quot;remember&quot; something that has not happened because it is more believable in terms of his/her schema. For example, if a well-dressed businessman draws a knife on a vagrant, the schemata of onlookers may (and often do) lead them to &quot;remember&quot; the vagrant pulling the knife. Such distortion of memory has been demonstrated. (See below.) Furthermore, it has also been seen to affect the formation of episodic memory in humans. For instance, one is more likely to remember a pencil case in an office than a skull, even if both were present in the office, when tested on certain recall conditions. 

Schemata are interrelated and multiple conflicting schemata can be applied to the same information. Schemata are generally thought to have a level of activation, which can spread among related schemata. Through different factors such as current activation, accessibility, priming, and emotion, a specific schema can be selected. 

&quot;Accessibility&quot; is how easily a schema can come to mind, and is determined by personal experience and expertise. This can be used as a cognitive shortcut, meaning it allows the most common explanation to be chosen for new information.

With priming (an increased sensitivity to a particular schema due to a recent experience), a brief imperceptible stimulus temporarily provides enough activation to a schema so that it is used for subsequent ambiguous information. Although this may suggest the possibility of subliminal messages, the effect of priming is so fleeting that it is difficult to detect outside laboratory conditions.

==Background research==

=== Frederic Bartlett ===
The original concept of schemata is linked with that of reconstructive memory as proposed and demonstrated in a series of experiments by Frederic Bartlett. Bartlett began presenting participants with information that was unfamiliar to their cultural backgrounds and expectations while subsequently monitoring how they recalled these different items of information (stories, etc). Bartlett was able to establish that individuals&#x27; existing schemata and stereotypes influence not only how they interpret &quot;schema-foreign&quot; new information but also how they recall the information over time. One of his most famous investigations involved asking participants to read a Native American folk tale, &quot;The War of the Ghosts&quot;, and recall it several times up to a year later. All the participants transformed the details of the story in such a way that it reflected their cultural norms and expectations, i.e. in line with their schemata. The factors that influenced their recall were:

* Omission of information that was considered irrelevant to a participant;
* Transformation of some of the details, or of the order in which events, etc., were recalled; a shift of focus and emphasis in terms of what was considered the most important aspects of the tale;
* Rationalization: details and aspects of the tale that would not make sense would be &quot;padded out&quot; and explained in an attempt to render them comprehensible to the individual in question;
* Cultural shifts: the content and the style of the story were altered in order to appear more coherent and appropriate in terms of the cultural background of the participant.

Bartlett&#x27;s work was crucially important in demonstrating that long-term memories are neither fixed nor unchanging but are constantly being adjusted as schemata evolve with experience. His work contributed to a framework of memory retrieval in which people construct the past and present in a constant process of narrative/discursive adjustment. Much of what people &quot;remember&quot; is confabulated narrative (adjusted and rationalized) which allows them to think of the past as a continuous and coherent string of events, even though it is probable that large sections of memory (both episodic and semantic) are irretrievable or inaccurate at any given time.

An important step in the development of schema theory was taken by the work of D.E. Rumelhart describing the understanding of narrative and stories. Further work on the concept of schemata was conducted by W.F. Brewer and J.C. Treyens, who demonstrated that the schema-driven expectation of the presence of an object was sometimes sufficient to trigger its incorrect recollection. An experiment was conducted where participants were requested to wait in a room identified as an academic&#x27;s study and were later asked about the room&#x27;s contents. A number of the participants recalled having seen books in the study whereas none were present. Brewer and Treyens concluded that the participants&#x27; expectations that books are present in academics&#x27; studies were enough to prevent their accurate recollection of the scenes.

In the 1970s, computer scientist Marvin Minsky was trying to develop machines that would have human-like abilities. When he was trying to create solutions for some of the difficulties he encountered he came across Bartlett&#x27;s work and concluded that if he was ever going to get machines to act like humans he needed them to use their stored knowledge to carry out processes. A frame construct was a way to represent knowledge in machines, while his frame construct can be seen as an extension and elaboration of the schema construct. He created the frame knowledge concept as a way to interact with new information. He proposed that fixed and broad information would be represented as the frame, but it would also be composed of slots that would accept a range of values; but if the world did not have a value for a slot, then it would be filled by a default value. Because of Minsky&#x27;s work, computers now have a stronger impact on psychology. In the 1980s, David Rumelhart extended Minsky&#x27;s ideas, creating an explicitly psychological theory of the mental representation of complex knowledge.

Roger Schank and Robert Abelson developed the idea of a script, which was known as a generic knowledge of sequences of actions. This led to many new empirical studies, which found that providing relevant schema can help improve comprehension and recall on passages.

Schemata have also been viewed from a sociocultural perspective with contributions from Lev Vygotsky, in which there is a transactional relationship between the development of a schema and the environment that influences it, such that the schema does not develop independently as a construct in the mind, but carries all the aspects of the history, social, and cultural meaning which influences its development. Schemata are not just scripts or frameworks to be called upon, but are active processes for solving problems and interacting with the world. However, schemas can also contribute to influential outside sociocultural perspectives, like the development of racism tendencies, disregard for marginalized communities and cultural misconceptions. 

==Modification==
New information that falls within an individual&#x27;s schema is easily remembered and incorporated into their worldview. However, when new information is perceived that does not fit a schema, many things can happen. One of the most common reactions is for a person to simply ignore or quickly forget the new information they acquired. This can happen on an unconscious level—meaning, unintentionally an individual may not even perceive the new information. People may also interpret the new information in a way that minimizes how much they must change their schemata. For example, Bob thinks that chickens do not lay eggs. He then sees a chicken laying an egg. Instead of changing the part of his schema that says &quot;chickens don&#x27;t lay eggs&quot;, he is likely to adopt the belief that the animal in question that he has just seen laying an egg is not a real chicken. This is an example of disconfirmation bias, the tendency to set higher standards for evidence that contradicts one&#x27;s expectations. This is also known as cognitive dissonance. However, when the new information cannot be ignored, existing schemata must be changed or new schemata must be created (accommodation).

Jean Piaget (1896–1980) was known best for his work with development of human knowledge. He believed knowledge was constructed on cognitive structures, and he believed people develop cognitive structures by accommodating and assimilating information. Accommodation is creating new schema that will fit better with the new environment or adjusting old schema. Accommodation could also be interpreted as putting restrictions on a current schema, and usually comes about when assimilation has failed. Assimilation is when people use a current schema to understand the world around them. Piaget thought that schemata are applied to everyday life and therefore people accommodate and assimilate information naturally. For example, if this chicken has red feathers, Bob can form a new schemata that says &quot;chickens with red feathers can lay eggs&quot;. This schemata, in the future, will either be changed or removed entirely. 

Assimilation is the reuse of schemata to fit the new information. For example, when a person sees an unfamiliar dog, they will probably just integrate it into their dog schema. However, if the dog behaves strangely, and in ways that does not seem dog-like, there will be an accommodation as a new schema is formed for that particular dog. With accommodation and assimilation comes the idea of equilibrium. Piaget describes equilibrium as a state of cognition that is balanced when schema are capable of explaining what it sees and perceives. When information is new and cannot fit into a previous existing schema, disequilibrium can happen. When disequilibrium happens, it means the person is frustrated and will try to restore the coherence of his or her cognitive structures through accommodation. If the new information is taken then assimilation of the new information will proceed until they find that they must make a new adjustment to it later down the road, but for now the person remains at equilibrium again. The process of equilibration is when people move from the equilibrium phase to the disequilibrium phase and back into equilibrium.

In view of this, a person&#x27;s new schemata may be an expansion of the schemata into a subtype. This allows for the information to be incorporated into existing beliefs without contradicting them. An example in social psychology would be the combination of a person&#x27;s beliefs about women and their beliefs about business. If women are not generally perceived to be in business, but the person meets a woman who is, a new subtype of businesswoman may be created, and the information perceived will be incorporated into this subtype. Activation of either woman or business schema may then make further available the schema of &quot;businesswoman&quot;. This also allows for previous beliefs about women or those in business to persist. Rather than modifying the schemata related to women or to business persons, the subtype is its own category.

==Self-schema==

Schemata about oneself are considered to be grounded in the present and based on past experiences. Memories are framed in the light of one&#x27;s self-conception. For example, people who have positive self-schemata (i.e. most people) selectively attend to flattering information and ignore unflattering information, with the consequence that flattering information is subject to deeper encoding, and therefore superior recall. Even when encoding is equally strong for positive and negative feedback, positive feedback is more likely to be recalled. Moreover, memories may even be distorted to become more favorable: for example, people typically remember exam grades as having been better than they actually were. However, when people have negative self views, memories are generally biased in ways that validate the negative self-schema; people with low self-esteem, for instance, are prone to remember more negative information about themselves than positive information. Thus, memory tends to be biased in a way that validates the agent&#x27;s pre-existing self-schema.

There are three major implications of self-schemata. First, information about oneself is processed faster and more efficiently, especially consistent information. Second, one retrieves and remembers information that is relevant to one&#x27;s self-schema. Third, one will tend to resist information in the environment that is contradictory to one&#x27;s self-schema. For instance, students with a particular self-schema prefer roommates whose view of them is consistent with that schema. Students who end up with roommates whose view of them is inconsistent with their self-schema are more likely to try to find a new roommate, even if this view is positive. This is an example of self-verification.

As researched by Aaron Beck, automatically activated negative self-schemata are a large contributor to depression. According to Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon (2012), these self-schemata are essentially the same type of cognitive structure as stereotypes studied by prejudice researchers (e.g., they are both well-rehearsed, automatically activated, difficult to change, influential toward behavior, emotions, and judgments, and bias information processing).

The self-schema can also be self-perpetuating. It can represent a particular role in society that is based on stereotype, for example: &quot;If a mother tells her daughter she looks like a tom boy, her daughter may react by choosing activities that she imagines a tom boy would do. Conversely, if the mother tells her she looks like a princess, her daughter might choose activities thought to be more feminine.&quot; This is an example of the self-schema becoming self-perpetuating when the person at hand chooses an activity that was based on an expectation rather than their desires.

==Schema therapy==

Schema therapy was founded by Jeffrey Young and represents a development of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) specifically for treating personality disorders. &quot;Early maladaptive schemata&quot; are described by Young as broad and pervasive themes or patterns made up of memories, feelings, sensations, and thoughts regarding oneself and one&#x27;s relationships with others; they can be a contributing factor to treatment outcomes of mental disorders and the maintenance of ideas, beliefs, and behaviors towards oneself and others. They are considered to develop during childhood or adolescence, and to be dysfunctional in that they lead to self-defeating behavior. Examples include schemata of abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emotional deprivation, and defectiveness/shame.

Schema therapy blends CBT with elements of Gestalt therapy, object relations, constructivist and psychoanalytic therapies in order to treat the characterological difficulties which both constitute personality disorders and which underlie many of the chronic depressive or anxiety-involving symptoms which present in the clinic. Young said that CBT may be an effective treatment for presenting symptoms, but without the conceptual or clinical resources for tackling the underlying structures (maladaptive schemata) which consistently organize the patient&#x27;s experience, the patient is likely to lapse back into unhelpful modes of relating to others and attempting to meet their needs. Young focused on pulling from different therapies equally when developing schema therapy. Cognitive behavioral methods work to increase the availability and strength of adaptive schemata while reducing the maladaptive ones. This may involve identifying the existing schema and then identifying an alternative to replace it. Difficulties arise as these types of schema often exist in absolutes; modification then requires replacement to be in absolutes, otherwise the initial belief may persist. The difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and schema therapy according to Young is the latter &quot;emphasizes lifelong patterns, affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with special emphasis on limited reparenting&quot;. He recommended this therapy would be ideal for clients with difficult and chronic psychological disorders. Some examples would be eating disorders and personality disorders. He has also had success with this therapy in relation to depression and substance abuse.

<text>The International Independent Hockey League (IIHL) was an independent semi-professional ice hockey league that played for less than one month in the Great Lakes Region of the United States in December 2003 and January 2004.

==History==
Six teams made up the IIHL, but only three teams Lansing, Northern Michigan and Soo City played more than six games.

The first IIHL game was played on December 7, 2003 in Harbor Springs, Michigan, between the Northern Michigan Predators and the Lansing Ice Nuts.

The league quickly gained a reputation for fluctuating schedules, folding teams and instability, and after just 16 games were played, folded in January 2004.

Former National Hockey League and minor league player Darren Banks served as head coach of the Motor City Snipers.

== Teams ==
* Lansing Ice Nuts (11-1)
* Motor City Snipers (0-2)
* Northern Michigan Predators (4-4)
* Ohio Valley Ice Cats (0-4)
* Soo City Mavericks (1-5)
* Tri-State Hurricanes - never played a league game

<text>Ella Louise Jenkins (August 6, 1924 – November 9, 2024) was an American singer-songwriter and centenarian. Called the &quot;First lady of children&#x27;s music&quot;, she was a leading performer of folk and children&#x27;s music. Her 1995 album &quot;Multicultural Children&#x27;s Songs&quot; has long been the most popular Smithsonian Folkways release. She appeared on numerous children&#x27;s television programs and in 2004, she received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. According to culture writer Mark Guarino, &quot;across her 67-year career, Jenkins firmly established the genre of children&#x27;s music as a serious endeavor — not just for artists to pursue but also for the recording industry to embrace and promote.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Jenkins was born to African American parents Annabelle Walker Jenkins and Obadiah Jenkins in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1924. When she was four years old, she moved to Chicago with her older brother and her now single mother, who worked as a domestic worker. She grew up in predominantly lower-middle-class neighborhoods in the south side of Chicago. Jenkins received no formal musical training, and developed an appreciation for music while growing up in a family of Christian Scientists with eclectic musical tastes. Her uncle, Floyd Johnson, introduced her to the harmonica and the blues of such renowned musicians as T-Bone Walker, Memphis Slim, Little Brother Montgomery and Big Bill Broonzy. Her family frequently moved around the south side and, as she moved to different neighborhoods, she learned new children&#x27;s rhythms, rhymes and games. Gospel music became a part of her soundscape as neighborhood churches broadcast their services onto the street. She also enjoyed tap dancing lessons at the local theater and was able to go to the Regal Theater to see such performers as Cab Calloway, Count Basie, and Peg Leg Bates. Cab Calloway is the person who she credits with getting her interested in call and response singing. As a teenager, Jenkins was also exposed to music from around the world through records released by Folkway Records. In the late 1940s, Jenkins was involved with the Chicago branch of Congress of Racial Equality.

She graduated from DuSable High School in 1942. She then worked at the Wrigley Company and at the University of Chicago in a clerical position. Three of her female coworkers encouraged her to return to school, and she entered Woodrow Wilson Junior College (now Kennedy–King College) in 1945; later in life, she tracked down all three women to thank them. At Woodrow Wilson, she became interested in the music of other cultures through her Mexican, Cuban and Puerto Rican friends. She graduated from Woodrow Wilson in 1947 with an associate&#x27;s degree. During these years, Jenkins was also an enthusiastic table tennis player. In 1948 she won the Chicagoland Women&#x27;s Table Tennis Championship, and was invited to join the national table tennis team, but was unable to due to associated costs.

She went on to attend Roosevelt University for a year before transferring to San Francisco State University, where she picked up Yiddish and Hebrew songs from her Jewish residence hall neighbors. While attending SFSU, she began singing in coffeehouses for adult audiences. In 1951, she graduated from SFSU with a BA in Sociology with minors in Child Psychology and Recreation. Upon graduating, she returned to Chicago.

Jenkins and the city of Chicago celebrated her 100th birthday on August 4, 2024 at Ella Jenkins Park in the Old Town Triangle neighborhood. On November 9, 2024, Jenkins died at an assisted living facility in Chicago; she was 100.

==Music career==
In Chicago, Jenkins began writing songs for children while volunteering in recreation centers and playing at Chicago folk clubs. She subsequently was hired as a Teenage Program Director for the YWCA in 1952. In 1956, while working at the YWCA, she was invited to perform on &quot;The Totem Club&quot;, a children&#x27;s program which aired on WTTW, Chicago&#x27;s NET (forerunner of PBS) affiliate. She was soon offered a regular job as the host of a Thursday afternoon program on the channel, which she titled &quot;This is Rhythm&quot;. This made Jenkins one of the nation&#x27;s first African-American television hosts. After landing the job, she left her position at the YWCA. She invited guests from diverse cultures, including Odetta and Big Bill Broonzy, to share their music&#x27;s rhythms on her show.

In 1956, Jenkins decided to give herself five years to try working as a full-time musician. Later that year, Jenkins met American folklorist, educator and record producer Kenneth S. Goldstein at the Gate of Horn folk music club in Chicago. Goldstein recommended that she bring a demo tape to Moses Asch, the founder of Folkways Records. Asch was receptive to her music and in 1957, her first album, &quot;Call-And-Response: Rhythmic Group Singing&quot;, was released by Folkways. 

In the early 1960s, Jenkins hosted a radio show called &quot;Meetin’ House&quot;. In 1962, Jenkins was offered the opportunity to work for the School Assembly Service, which developed educational programs for schools. Jenkins developed &quot;Adventures in Rhythm&quot;, a program aimed at teenagers, which she took on the road and put on at school assemblies until September 1963. She and musician Harold Hampton Murray engaged the students with their call-and-response style and their appeal to &quot;[students&#x27;] desire for forbidden knowledge,&quot; by presenting songs as ways to &quot;convey histories that were not in their textbooks&quot;. Jenkins and Murray, who was also African American, faced prejudice and racism throughout their tour. In 1964, she performed at Martin Luther King Jr.’s Illinois Rally for Civil Rights. The 1960s also marked the beginning of her business relationship with Bernadelle Richter, whom she met after Richter hired Jenkins to perform at the American Youth Hostel folk weekend. Richter &quot;handled the business&quot; of Jenkins&#x27; career, leaving her to focus on compositions and performances.

Jenkins was holding music workshops for children&#x27;s educators by the early 1970s.

Jenkins began to receive wider attention in the early 1980s, after appearing as a guest on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and being subsequently invited to appear on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood.&quot; In 1985, she appeared on &quot;Free at Last&quot;, a television special about Martin Luther King Jr. which was hosted by LeVar Burton. On the special, Jenkins performed the song &quot;You Better Leave Segregation Alone&quot;. She later made television appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; and PBS&#x27;s &quot;Barney &amp; Friends.&quot;

As a performer and educator, Jenkins traveled extensively, performing her songs on all seven continents (even Antarctica). As she traveled, she not only shared her music and experiences but also learned about the cultures of the people she is visiting, taking with her musical traditions and languages that she then shared with her audiences. She performed at America&#x27;s Reunion on the Mall in 1993, America&#x27;s Millennium Celebration in 2000, and at Smithsonian&#x27;s 150th Birthday Party on the Mall in Washington, DC in 1996. In collaboration with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, she acted as a U.S. delegate to Hong Kong, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the former Soviet Union. She was a performer at the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Illinois for 40 years.

In 2017, she was named a recipient of the National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts. Jenkins never officially retired, although she stopped giving public performances after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

=== Albums ===
Folkways Records and Smithsonian Folkways Recordings released 39 albums by Jenkins, including the popular 1966 album &quot;You&#x27;ll Sing a Song and I&#x27;ll Sing a Song&quot; and 1995 album &quot;Multicultural Children&#x27;s Songs&quot;. Jenkins&#x27; repertoire included nursery rhymes, holiday songs, bilingual songs, international songs, rhythmic chants, and original songs. Nearly all of her albums include children singing with her. 

Jenkins&#x27; albums often drew on African and African-American music. Her second album, &quot;Adventures in Rhythm&quot;, incorporated West and North African chants, and her third album, &quot;African American Folk Rhythms&quot;, included the song &quot;No More Auction Block&quot;, which was sung by African-American soldiers during the American Civil War. Her 1970 album, &quot;A Long Time&quot;, included African American spirituals and songs from the civil rights movement.

As a recording artist, Jenkins gained extensive recognition. Her recordings received two Grammy Award nominations in the category of Best Musical Album for Children, and in 2004, she was recognized with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Jenkins&#x27; final album, &quot;Camp Songs with Ella Jenkins and Friends&quot;, was released in 2017.

==As an educator==
Jenkins saw children as genuine, down to earth people who should be listened to and recognized as having much to offer. Fellow music educator Patricia Shehan Campbell called her as &quot;a pioneer in her early and continuing realization that children have something to sing about, that the essence of who they are may be expressed through song, and that much of what they need to know of their language, heritage, and current cultural concepts may be communicated to them through song&quot;. Jenkins used call-and-response singing to promote group participation.

== Legacy ==
Jenkins was dubbed the &quot;First Lady of Children&#x27;s Song&quot;. As noted in an obituary to Jenkins, &quot;Before Jenkins, children&#x27;s music in the United States consisted primarily of simplified, often cartoonish renditions of classical music&quot;. She has been cited as an influence of later children&#x27;s musicians, such as Dan Zanes.

&quot;A Life of Song: The Story of Ella Jenkins. The First Lady of Children&#x27;s Music&quot; was published by Gloo Books on February 1, 2024. It is the first kids picture book published about the life of Ella Jenkins. Author Ty-Juana Taylor noted that &quot;Ms. Jenkins has used music as a tool to bridge and unite people across the world, especially in highly divisive times of the U.S. Civil Rights era.&quot; The book is illustrated by Jade Johnson.

Academic Gayle F. Ward plans to release a biography of Jenkins in 2025 through Chicago University Press.

<doc id="1058567" wikidata="Q303051" url="?curid=1058567" title="Aarre Merikanto">
<text>Aarre Merikanto (29 June 1893 – 28 September 1958) was a Finnish composer.

He was born in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland, the son of Elise &quot;Liisa&quot; Häyrynen (1869–1949) and the famous romantic composer, professor Oskar Merikanto (1868–1924). His childhood he spent in Vilppula, Finland. He married Meri Grönmark in 1919. They had two daughters, Anna Marjatta Peltonen (née Merikanto) and Arma Kyllikki Tukia (née Merikanto). He later married Evi Sylvia Mähönen (1910–1968). They had two sons, Ukri Uolevi Merikanto (1950–2010), a sculptor and Pan Ylermi Merikanto (1951–2012). He is considered a key figure in early Finnish modernism (together with Väinö Raitio and Ernest Pingoud) and several of his works, most notably the opera Juha, have obtained posthumous attention. As professor of composition in the Sibelius Academy (1951–1958) Merikanto taught several Finnish composers of the next generation, including Einojuhani Rautavaara, Usko Meriläinen, Aulis Sallinen and Paavo Heininen.

He studied music in Helsinki 1911, Leipzig 1912–1914 and Moscow 1916–1917. Merikanto&#x27;s early style was rooted in Finnish romanticism, but in the 1920s he developed a personal, atonal but not dodecaphonic Modernist style. The reception of Merikanto&#x27;s works of this period was mixed: the &quot;Schott&quot; Concerto for nine instruments was awarded in a competition organized by the German publishers Schott &amp; Söhne, but his domestic Finnish audiences and critics were generally unenthusiastic and his opera Juha, today considered one of his major works, was never performed during Merikanto&#x27;s lifetime. Disappointed with the reactions, starting in the early 1930s, Merikanto gradually abandoned his more radical style and turned towards a more traditional idiom based on Neoclassicism. He also destroyed or mutilated the scores of several works from his earlier style period, some of which were later reconstructed by his last composition student Paavo Heininen. His work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Merikanto was diagnosed with lung cancer in the summer 1957, and he died on 28 September the following year, in Helsinki, aged 65.

<text>Monster House was a Discovery Channel television program that documented the themed remodeling of a residence in a five-day time frame. In 2004, the episode &quot;Zen House&quot; was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music for its opening song by composer Dan Mackenzie.

In early 2006, Discovery Channel announced the show had been canceled and the final episode, titled &quot;Farewell House&quot;, aired in February.

&quot;Monster House&quot; was rerun in 2012 on Spike TV and in 2015 on BUZZR.

==Premise==
Home owners apply to &quot;Monster House&quot; to have their houses radically remodeled according to themes they specify, for example dinosaurs, Egypt and gangsters. The show&#x27;s host, Steve Watson, then recruits a team of five or six builders, who almost always do not know each other, to radically remodel any parts of a house (including yards) that the show&#x27;s producers choose, although the home owner may declare some areas &quot;off-limits&quot;. The builders win prize packages of tools, worth thousands of dollars, if the build is completed on time. The build starts on a Monday morning and must be finished by midnight on Friday. Often, the builders will have to get all of the constructing, fabrication, and furniture in place, and the in-show designer (who was not recruited) would finish hanging curtains, place pillows, make the bed, and small decorative touches.

Other than picking the theme, the owners have no say in the design process and only get to see the results, not the progress of the build. The owners live for the week in a recreational vehicle parked in front of the house. If the owners are caught peeking at the construction, they are &quot;penalized&quot; by Watson in the form of a practical joke. If the builders fail to meet the deadline, a separate group of &quot;superstar&quot; builders is brought in to complete the effort.

The show has two interesting facets: the outlandish designs and the interactions between the builders. The workers occasionally have personality conflicts. Toward the end of the week, fatigue increases tempers, especially if the build is not going well.
Most builds were completed in the allotted times, usually finishing near midnight on Fridays. Some builds, however, were accomplished far more quickly. During the &quot;Zen House&quot;, the build team finished so quickly that they could assist the interior decorators and have the family moved in on Friday night. The &quot;Shark House&quot; build was actually finished by Thursday afternoon, but specialty builds and decorations weren&#x27;t scheduled until that Saturday, so the build was still officially completed on Saturday. On at least two on-camera occasions, the build was not completed on time by the original team, while other episodes showed builders bowing to pressure and leaving the set during construction. The show allowed some of these builders to redeem themselves during a special &quot;Dog House&quot; two-part episode. A married couple had requested the show to build a large doghouse in their back yard for their several large dogs. The production brought back several failed builders (since they were, metaphorically, &quot;in the doghouse&quot; with the show) to do the build. This time around, the builders were finally successful.

The show originally only remodeled residential houses, but in the third season, expanded to public buildings such as a teachers&#x27; lounge of a school, a fire station kitchen, and a police station break room. During the final season, the series regularly employed product placement by including a bald actor portraying advertising mascot Mr. Clean who would stand around during the last-minute cleanup jobs and nod approvingly.

==Episodes==
In all, sixty houses or other buildings were remodeled over 3 seasons. Six episodes have been produced under the &quot;Monster House: Revisited&quot; banner; these episodes were just re-runs of the original episode with an added interview of the homeowners some time after the build was completed. The first episode &quot;Race Car House&quot; premiered June 2, 2003, and the final episode &quot;Farewell House&quot; was aired on February 27, 2006.

Some examples of themes were &quot;Outback House&quot; which had projects like an Uluru-shaped couch made in foam, and the &quot;New York House&quot; where a steel dining table was shaped like the main span of the Triborough Bridge.
==International broadcasts==
In Australia, Monster House currently airs on the Seven Network&#x27;s free-to-air digital channel 7mate at approximately 11.30am Saturday mornings.

In China, Monster House currently airs on the RTS&#x27;s ICS at 7.00pm from Monday to Friday.

In Italy, Monster House currently airs on Real Time at 5.20pm.

<doc id="1058578" wikidata="Q2098139" url="?curid=1058578" title="Kringle">
<text>Kringle (, ) is a Northern European pastry, a variety of pretzel. Pretzels were introduced by Roman Catholic monks in the 13th century in Denmark, and from there they spread throughout Scandinavia and evolved into several kinds of sweet, salty or filled pastries, all in the shape of kringle.

In Danish and Norwegian, the word is &quot;kringle&quot;, plural &quot;kringler&quot;; , plural &quot;kringlid&quot;; , plural &quot;kliņģeri&quot;; , plural &quot;kringlor&quot;; , plural &quot;rinkelit&quot;; and Icelandic: &quot;kringla&quot;. The word originates from the Old Norse &quot;kringla&quot;, meaning ring or circle.
In the Netherlands, a particular type of sweet kringle is well known under the Dutch name &quot;krakeling&quot;.

The shape of the kringle has given name to a similarly entangled feature found in some proteins, the so-called kringle domain.

== Scandinavia ==
In Denmark, &quot;kringle&quot; denotes the pretzel-like knotted shape rather than the pretzel pastry type. Kringler may be made from puff pastry (like Danish pastry) or yeast dough, filled with remonce or marzipan and raisins, sprinkled with coarse sugar, nut flakes or icing.

Other types of kringles in Scandinavia include &quot;saltkringler&quot;, which are small salty kringler - the Scandinavian equivalent of pretzels -, and &quot;kommenskringler&quot; which are half-hand-sized breads in the kringle shape, made from unsweetened yeast dough spiced with caraway seeds. &quot;Sukkerkringler&quot; are similar, but sweet pretzels, sprinkled with sugar instead of caraway. &quot;Fødselsdagskringler&quot; are a large sweet bread pretzel for birthday celebrations. &quot;Smørkringler&quot; are large crusty and sweet pretzels with a spread of butter on the backside. Smørkringler are not as popular nowadays.

Kringler are pastries with a long history in Denmark, and are still popular items in modern Danish bakeries. Nowadays, kringles are usually made with only one crossing and not two, as in the original kringle and pretzel shape.

==United States==

In the United States, kringles are hand-rolled from Danish pastry dough (&quot;wienerbrød&quot; dough) that has been rested overnight before shaping, filling, and baking.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatscookingamerica/kringle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many sheets of the flaky dough are layered, then shaped into an oval. After filling with fruit, nut, or other flavor combinations, the pastry is baked and iced.

Racine, Wisconsin, has historically&lt;ref name=&quot;shepherdexpress/kringle-official&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; been a center of Danish-American culture and kringle-making.&lt;ref name=&quot;biztimes/racine-kringle-battle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A typical Racine-made kringle is a large, flat oval measuring approximately 14 inches by 10 inches (35 cm by 25 cm) and weighing about 1.5 lb (680 g). The kringle became the official state pastry of Wisconsin on June 30, 2013. A Wisconsin distillery in Middleton, Wisconsin, makes a kringle-flavored cream liqueur from Wisconsin cream, rum, sugar, and natural kringle flavor.

In other parts of the United States, kringle may refer to a slightly sweet buttermilk cookie shaped like a pretzel or figure eight.

Other places where kringles may be found in the United States include the Ballard area of Seattle, Washington; Redmond, Washington; Solvang, California; Story City, Iowa; Burr Ridge, Illinois; Springfield, Missouri, and Watertown, Massachusetts. In 2005, Dana College in Blair, Nebraska, held a Kringle Kontest, which was won by Kirsten&#x27;s Danish Bakery in Burr Ridge, Illinois.

== Symbolism ==
Baker&#x27;s guilds in Europe have used the kringle or pretzel as a symbol for centuries. It is told (but currently unconfirmed by historic documents), that when Vienna was besieged by the Turkish Ottoman armies in 1529, local bakers working in the night gave the city defence an early warning of the attacking enemy. For this, they were later rewarded by the Pope, with permission to use a crown as part of their kringle guild symbol.

The guild in Denmark is now the only baker&#x27;s guild in the world with official authority to display a royal crown as part of their baker&#x27;s guild trade symbol that is often hung outside of bakery shops.

<doc id="1058580" wikidata="Q1367599" url="?curid=1058580" title="Suite bergamasque">
<text>Suite bergamasque (L. 75) () is a piano suite by Claude Debussy. He began composing it around 1890, at the age of 28, but significantly revised it just before its 1905 publication. The popularity of the third movement, Clair de lune, has made it one of the composer&#x27;s most famous works for piano, as well as one of the most famous musical pieces of all time.

==Background==
Debussy was initially unwilling to use these relatively early piano compositions because they were not in his mature style, but in 1905 he accepted the offer of a publisher who thought they would be successful, given the fame Debussy had gained in the intervening fifteen years. While it is not known how much of the &quot;Suite&quot; was written in 1890 and how much was written in 1905, it is clear that Debussy changed the names of at least two of the pieces. &quot;Passepied&quot; had first been composed under the title &quot;Pavane&quot;, while &quot;Clair de lune&quot; was originally entitled &quot;Promenade sentimentale&quot;. These names come from poems by Paul Verlaine. The title of the third movement of &quot;Suite bergamasque&quot; is taken from Verlaine&#x27;s poem &quot;Clair de lune&quot;, which refers to bergamasks in the opening stanza:

==Structure==
&quot;Suite bergamasque&quot; consists of four movements:

# &quot;Prélude&quot; (Moderato tempo rubato, F major, )
# &quot;Menuet&quot; (Andante, A minor, )
# &quot;Clair de lune&quot; (Andante très expressif, D major, )
# &quot;Passepied&quot; (Allegretto ma non troppo, F minor, )

=== &quot;Prélude&quot; ===
The first piece in the suite is in the key of F major and marked &quot;moderato tempo rubato&quot;. Its legato phrases give it a smooth, flowing feel.

===&quot;Menuet&quot;===
The second movement is in A minor. Rather than mimicking the articulations of a baroque minuet from the start, Debussy eschews the accent on the downbeat of the first measures. The light, fluttery embellishments Debussy writes throughout the movement give it the character of an arabesque.
===&quot;Clair de lune&quot;===

The third movement is in D major. It is written in compound triple meter () and marked &quot;andante très expressif&quot;. Its title, which means &quot;moonlight&quot; in French, is taken from Verlaine&#x27;s poem &quot;Clair de lune&quot;. It is not to be confused with the two settings of the poem composed by Debussy for voice and piano accompaniment.

===&quot;Passepied&quot;===
The final movement is in F minor, marked &quot;allegretto ma non troppo&quot;. A passepied is a type of dance that originated in Brittany. This movement is fast and light, with the left hand playing an almost continuous quaver or eighth-note accompaniment. The movement includes the use of 3 against 4 polyrhythm.

==Arrangements==
&quot;Suite bergamasque&quot; has been orchestrated and arranged by many people, both for concert performance and for use in other media.

In particular, &quot;Clair de lune&quot; has been arranged for a wide variety of instrumental combinations, including notable orchestrations by André Caplet, Leopold Stokowski, and Lucien Cailliet.

&quot;Clair de lune&quot; was originally intended to be included as a fully orchestrated piece in the 1940 Walt Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. However, due to runtime issues, it was eventually not included in the final cut of the film. Instead, the footage for its intended segment (featuring herons in the Florida Everglades at night) was recycled for the &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; segment of the subsequent film &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;. However, the &quot;Clair de lune&quot; segment was later restored after a workprint of it was rediscovered in 1992, complete with an original score by Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. It is included as a bonus feature in some later releases of &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

&quot;Passepied&quot; was arranged by the Punch Brothers for bluegrass instrumentation for their album &quot;The Phosphorescent Blues&quot;.

A synthesizer version was produced by the Japanese electronic music pioneer Isao Tomita for his 1974 album &quot;Snowflakes Are Dancing&quot;, consisting of arrangements and renditions of compositions by Debussy, including &quot;Passepied&quot;. It was used at the Closing Ceremony at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo on 8 August 2021, as a nod to Paris as the next host city, while children prayed for peace and as the Olympic Flame was extinguished. 

A cover version of &quot;Clair de lune&quot; with lyrics written by Rafael Jaime and titled &quot;I Am Born Again&quot; is prominently featured in the 2024 Mexican independent short film &quot;Mi Hermano Lobo (My Brother Wolf)&quot;. The song is performed off-screen by 8-year-old Jorge Luis Jiménez Avilés in the lead role of Rafael.

<text>Francis Andrew Brewin (1907–1983) was a lawyer and Canadian politician and Member of Parliament. He was the grandson of Andrew George Blair a Liberal cabinet minister who was also the Premier of New Brunswick. His son John Brewin also served in the House of Commons of Canada.

== Biography ==
Born on 3 September 1907 in Brighton, England, Brewin was a stalwart in the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and ran numerous times at the federal and provincial levels in the 1940 and 1950s. As a lawyer in the 1940s, he was retained by the Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians to contest the federal government&#x27;s deportation orders affecting thousands of Japanese Canadians. Led by Brewin, the &quot;Japanese Canadian Reference Case&quot; was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada and later, on appeal, by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Brewin was also retained by a committee of Japanese Canadians who had been detained during the Second World War as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; in order to try to have their property restored. He succeeded in persuading the government to call a royal commission to investigate the question.

In 1945, he was asked by Ontario CCF leader Ted Jolliffe to be co-counsel during the infamous LeBel Royal Commission that was looking into whether or not Ontario&#x27;s premier at the time was employing a secret political police force. He was, for a time, the President of the Ontario CCF and was a candidate for the leadership of the Ontario CCF at the party&#x27;s 1953 leadership convention, but lost to Donald C. MacDonald.

Brewin stood as a CCF candidate several times, starting with the 1945 Canadian federal election in the riding of St. Paul&#x27;s, but was unsuccessful. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada on behalf of the CCF&#x27;s successor, the New Democratic Party. Brewin sat as Member of Parliament for the Toronto riding of Greenwood from the 1962 election until his retirement in 1979.

Coming from the theological tradition of figures such as Richard Hooker, F. D. Maurice, and William Temple, Andrew Brewin considered himself a Christian socialist and wrote a number of books and pamphlets on the topic. He was a member of the Fellowship for a Christian Social Order and the League for Social Reconstruction.

Andrew Brewin wrote the book &quot;Stand on Guard: The Search for a Canadian Defence Policy&quot;, published by McClelland &amp; Stewart in 1965, that explored Canada&#x27;s military&#x27;s changing role in the mid-twentieth century, including its participation in the then new concept of United Nations peacekeeping.

His son John Brewin later served in Parliament. He also had four daughters: Margaret Wilbur; Martha Hynna, who served as secretary general of the Canadian Human Rights Commission; Mary Lewis, who served as chief mission and research officer of the Heart and Stroke Foundation; and Jane Morley, QC, who served as child and youth officer for British Columbia.

Brewin died on 21 September 1983.

<text>Nikos Konstantopoulos (; born 8 June 1942) is a Greek politician, former member of the Hellenic Parliament and former president of the left-wing Synaspismos. His daughter, Zoe Konstantopoulou, until September 2015, was the Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament.

==Biography==
Born in 1942 in the village of Krestena, near Olympia, Konstantopoulos studied law in the University of Athens. During his period as a law student he became actively involved in the student movement as a member of the Center Union.

During the Greek military junta of 1967-1974, his ideas became more radical. He was a member of the Democratic Defense anti-junta resistance group. He was arrested, tortured and sentenced in 8 years of imprisonment by the regime in 1970. After the restoration of democracy in 1974, Konstantopoulos joined the movement for the abolishment of the monarchy in the country, a goal succeeded through the 1974 referendum.

Ηe was charter member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in 1974. One year later, he was expelled due to his disagreement with the party&#x27;s leader, Andreas Papandreou. Together with professor Sakis Karagiorgas, a partner from the resistance, he founded a party called Socialist March (Greek: &quot;Σοσιαλιστική Πορεία&quot;), which he served as spokesman from 1975 to 1979. He took part in the 1977 general election as a member of the short-lived Socialist March within the Alliance of Progressive and Left-Wing Forces (Greek: Συμμαχία των Αριστερών και Προοδευτικών Δυνάμεων).

He became a founding and leading member of Synaspismos in 1989. In the same year, he was elected member of the parliament and served as minister for the interior in the coalition government of Tzannis Tzannetakis, New Democracy. This unusual left-conservative alliance, plus the fact that Konstantopoulos was one of the prosecution lawyers in the trials (Koskotas scandal) of Andreas Papandreou and many others of his former PASOK companions, made Synaspismos and personally Konstantopoulos targets of severe criticism.

In the 1993 general election, the failure of Synaspismos to pass the 3 per cent threshold in order to enter the parliament was a near disaster for the party. Maria Damanaki, who was then the president of Synaspismos, resigned from her position, and Konstantopoulos was elected as the party leader. He soon became very popular, being among the top in opinion polls. In the 1996 election, Synaspismos re-entered the parliament with a percentage of 5.2 percent countrywide, a success credited to a large extent to Konstantopoulos himself.

In the 2000 general election held in April, Synaspismos got 3.2 percent at a national level.

In the 2004 general election held in March, Synaspismos narrowly escaped from being excluded from the parliament again, acquiring 3.2 percent at a national level, despite the fact it had formed an alliance (&quot;Syriza&quot;) with other minor parties of the Greek left. This alliance became inactive in a few weeks&#x27; time, failing to participate united in the same year&#x27;s European Parliament election (June). Konstantopoulos received criticism from both his party&#x27;s members and his left allies for the two consecutive failures, and announced that he would retire as president at the next Synaspismos congress. The Synaspismos congress of December 2004 elected Alekos Alavanos as the party president.

Konstantopoulos has also worked as a lawyer, specializing in various issues of institutional reforms, law modernization, criminal law and the defence of civil rights.

In 2010, he was for a short time president of Panathinaikos F.C.

<doc id="1058595" wikidata="Q2052894" url="?curid=1058595" title="Olga Petrova">
<text>Olga Petrova (born Muriel Harding; 10 May 1884 – 30 November 1977) was a British-American actress, screenwriter and playwright.

==Origins==
In adulthood, Olga Petrova insisted that she had been born in Warsaw, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, and throughout her life she spoke with an appropriate accent, even in private. However, it was widely accepted later in her career that she was in reality Muriel Harding, born in England (but not in London, as sometimes stated erroneously). It is probable that her birth name was Ellen Constance Muriel Harding, born in Portsea, Hampshire, the daughter of Ellen and Herbert Harding, who was a municipal tax collector. The family moved shortly after her birth to Tuebrook, Liverpool, where she grew up and where her younger siblings were born.

==Career==
Harding left home after feeling stifled by her father&#x27;s strict rules. According to her memoir she became a governess, but soon moved to London for a career on the stage. She probably chose the name and persona of Madame Olga Petrova herself, though later publicity suggested that the name was chosen by a producer, to reflect the penchant at the time for elegant Russian stars such as Anna Pavlova. In any event, Petrova began to present herself as a glamorous Russian or Polish actress. She made her first notable appearance under that name at the London Pavilion in April 1911, and her success led to her being quickly signed up for the Folies-Bergere cabaret in New York. 

She first performed in New York in mid-1911, and later that year took a leading role in the musical comedy &quot;The Quaker Girl&quot; on Broadway before returning to vaudeville. She insisted on, and gained, top billing on a show at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, where she was described in &quot;Variety&quot; in 1912 as &quot;one of the cleverest, classiest, and most attractive of turns&quot;. In 1913, she met local physician John Dillon Stewart in Indianapolis, Indiana, and they married that year in Kansas City. Stewart moved his practice to New York City to be near her primary base of operations.

Petrova returned to theatre performance in 1914, and was offered a film contract, appearing first in &quot;The Tigress&quot;, directed by Alice Guy-Blaché, and then in a succession of silent films through 1917. She disliked playing weak female characters, and spending time idle when making films. She set up her own film company, and wrote for a number of periodicals. She starred in a number of films for Solax Studios and Metro Pictures, where she was usually given the role of a &quot;femme fatale&quot;. During her seven years in film, Petrova appeared in more than two dozen films and wrote the script for several others. Most of her films are now lost, including what she considered her best pictures, those directed by Maurice Tourneur. The Library of Congress Silent Feature Film Database indicates three of her films survive: &quot;The Vampire&quot; (1915), &quot;Extravagance&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Waiting Soul&quot; (1918).

She was a skilled self-publicist, and was described as &quot;an extraordinarily strong and determined female,&quot; and as &quot;highly eccentric&quot;. Both on stage and on screen, Petrova became noted for her insistence on portraying independent and free-thinking women with strong personalities. She said in 1918: &quot;The only women I want to play are women who do things. I want to encourage women to do things to take their rightful place in life.&quot; She also wrote that she preferred to play &quot;the woman of today: a modern, quick thinking and wholly human woman&quot;.

She left the film industry in 1918 but continued to act in Broadway productions, including many performances at the prestigious Palace Theatre. During the 1920s, she wrote three plays, in which she starred; &quot;Hurricane&quot; dealt with birth control and &quot;What Do We Know?&quot; with spiritualism, both controversial subjects. She toured the U.S. with a theater troupe, before returning to vaudeville successfully in 1923. She also interviewed a number of prominent film stars on paid assignment for &quot;Shadowland&quot; magazine, &quot;Motion Picture Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Photoplay Journal&quot;, including Marion Davies, Mary Pickford, Theda Bara, Alla Nazimova, Norma Talmadge, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and Rudolf Valentino.

==Later life and death==
She made several visits to Saranac Lake, New York at the height of her fame at the request of theatrical agent William Morris. In the summer of 1921, she turned the first shovel of earth for a housing project sponsored by the chamber of commerce at a lot on Lake Street donated by Walter Jenkins. The Petrova School and Petrova Avenue bear her name.

She retired to live in the south of France in the late 1920s. At the start of World War II, she returned to the U.S., and settled in Clearwater, Florida, with her second husband, Louis Willoughby. In 1942, she published her autobiography &quot;Butter with My Bread&quot;.

Olga Petrova died in 1977 in Clearwater, Florida, aged 93. She had no children.

She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>Karin Ann-Marie Söder (née Bergenfur; 30 November 1928 – 19 December 2015) was a Swedish Centre politician. She was the first woman in Sweden to be elected the leader of a major political party. She headed the Swedish Centre Party from 1985 to 1987. She was also one of the first female foreign ministers in the world.

==Biography==
Söder was born in Frykerud in Kil Municipality, Värmland. Having graduated from secondary school in Gothenburg, she studied in Falun, and worked as a teacher, first in Värmland and later in Täby, north of Stockholm, where she was a member of the local council from 1963 to 1971. She also sat on the Stockholm County Council from 1969 to 1973. She died in Täby in 2015.

==Political career==

===Ascendancy===
In 1971, Söder was elected a Member of the Swedish Parliament, a position she held until 1991. The same year she became a member of parliament, she also became the second vice leader of the Centre Party. When Sweden got a centre-right government under Centre Party Prime Minister Thorbjörn Fälldin in 1976, she was named Minister for Foreign Affairs, the first woman ever to hold the post in Sweden. Söder&#x27;s party left the government in 1978 over a conflict on nuclear power, and she was succeeded by liberal Hans Blix. In 1979 the Centre Party rejoined the coalition, and Söder returned to the Cabinet as Minister of Health and Social Affairs in 1979. The same year she was promoted to the post as the party&#x27;s first vice leader. She held her ministerial post until the centre-right coalition lost the 1982 elections to the Social Democrats.

===Leader of the Centre Party===
In 1985, when Thorbjörn Fälldin stepped down after an unsuccessful election, she finally reached the highest position in her party, making the Centre Party the first major Swedish party to be headed by a woman. Her time at the top would however be short. For health reasons, she left the party leadership in 1987, succeeded by Olof Johansson.

===Other positions===

During her years in politics, she also held posts as chairperson of Save the Children Sweden 1983–1995 and as President of the Nordic Council 1984–1985 and 1989–1990. She has also served as a member of several company boards, including Skandia and Wermlandsbanken, as well as on the Board of the Royal Institute of Technology. She once again made political headlines in 2003, when she co-signed an article urging her fellow party members to vote Yes in the Swedish Euro referendum, opposing the official party line.

Despite her varied accomplishments, the political legacy Söder is most known for among Swedes may be the 1980 reform that shut the stores of &quot;Systembolaget&quot;, the national alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly, on Saturdays. The policy remained in place for many years, but was abolished in 2001.

== Awards ==
Söder was awarded the Illis quorum by the government of Sweden in 1991.
