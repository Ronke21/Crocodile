<text>In mathematics, an additive set function is a function formula_1 mapping sets to numbers, with the property that its value on a union of two disjoint sets equals the sum of its values on these sets, namely, formula_2 If this additivity property holds for any two sets, then it also holds for any finite number of sets, namely, the function value on the union of &quot;k&quot; disjoint sets (where &quot;k&quot; is a finite number) equals the sum of its values on the sets. Therefore, an additive set function is also called a finitely additive set function (the terms are equivalent). However, a finitely additive set function might not have the additivity property for a union of an &quot;infinite&quot; number of sets. A σ-additive set function is a function that has the additivity property even for countably infinite many sets, that is, formula_3

Additivity and sigma-additivity are particularly important properties of measures. They are abstractions of how intuitive properties of size (length, area, volume) of a set sum when considering multiple objects. Additivity is a weaker condition than σ-additivity; that is, σ-additivity implies additivity.

The term [[#modular set function|modular set function]] is equivalent to additive set function; see modularity below.

==Additive (or finitely additive) set functions==

Let formula_4 be a set function defined on an algebra of sets formula_5 with values in formula_6 (see the extended real number line). The function formula_4 is called &#x27; or &#x27;, if whenever formula_8 and formula_9 are disjoint sets in formula_10 then
formula_11
A consequence of this is that an additive function cannot take both formula_12 and formula_13 as values, for the expression formula_14 is undefined.

One can prove by mathematical induction that an additive function satisfies
formula_15
for any formula_16 disjoint sets in formula_17

==σ-additive set functions==

Suppose that formula_5 is a σ-algebra. If for every sequence formula_19 of pairwise disjoint sets in formula_10 
formula_21
holds then formula_4 is said to be or . 
Every -additive function is additive but not vice versa, as shown below.

==τ-additive set functions==

Suppose that in addition to a sigma algebra formula_23 we have a topology formula_24 If for every directed family of measurable open sets formula_25
formula_26
we say that formula_4 is formula_28-additive. In particular, if formula_4 is inner regular (with respect to compact sets) then it is τ-additive.

==Properties==

Useful properties of an additive set function formula_4 include the following.

===Value of empty set===

Either formula_31 or formula_4 assigns formula_33 to all sets in its domain, or formula_4 assigns formula_12 to all sets in its domain. &quot;Proof&quot;: additivity implies that for every set formula_36 formula_37 (it&#x27;s possible in the edge case of an empty domain that the only choice for formula_8 is the empty set itself, but that still works). If formula_39 then this equality can be satisfied only by plus or minus infinity.

===Monotonicity===

If formula_4 is non-negative and formula_41 then formula_42 That is, formula_4 is a . Similarly, If formula_4 is non-positive and formula_41 then formula_46 

===Modularity===

A set function formula_4 on a family of sets formula_48 is called a and a  if whenever formula_36 formula_50 formula_51 and formula_52 are elements of formula_53 then
formula_54 
The above property is called and the argument below proves that additivity implies modularity.

Given formula_8 and formula_50 formula_57 &quot;Proof&quot;: write formula_58 and formula_59 and formula_60 where all sets in the union are disjoint. Additivity implies that both sides of the equality equal formula_61

However, the related properties of &quot;submodularity&quot; and &quot;subadditivity&quot; are not equivalent to each other.

Note that modularity has a different and unrelated meaning in the context of complex functions; see modular form.

===Set difference===

If formula_41 and formula_63 is defined, then formula_64

==Examples==

An example of a -additive function is the function formula_4 defined over the power set of the real numbers, such that 
formula_66

If formula_19 is a sequence of disjoint sets of real numbers, then either none of the sets contains 0, or precisely one of them does. In either case, the equality 
formula_68
holds.

See measure and signed measure for more examples of -additive functions.

A &quot;charge&quot; is defined to be a finitely additive set function that maps formula_69 to formula_70 (Cf. ba space for information about &quot;bounded&quot; charges, where we say a charge is &quot;bounded&quot; to mean its range is a bounded subset of &quot;R&quot;.)

===An additive function which is not σ-additive===

An example of an additive function which is not σ-additive is obtained by considering formula_4, defined over the Lebesgue sets of the real numbers formula_72 by the formula
formula_73
where formula_74 denotes the Lebesgue measure and formula_75 the Banach limit. It satisfies formula_76 and if formula_77 then formula_78

One can check that this function is additive by using the linearity of the limit. That this function is not σ-additive follows by considering the sequence of disjoint sets
formula_79
for formula_80 The union of these sets is the positive reals, and formula_4 applied to the union is then one, while formula_4 applied to any of the individual sets is zero, so the sum of formula_83 is also zero, which proves the counterexample.

==Generalizations==

One may define additive functions with values in any additive monoid (for example any group or more commonly a vector space). For sigma-additivity, one needs in addition that the concept of limit of a sequence be defined on that set. For example, spectral measures are sigma-additive functions with values in a Banach algebra. Another example, also from quantum mechanics, is the positive operator-valued measure.

<text>The baseball color line excluded players of Black African descent from Major League Baseball and its affiliated Minor Leagues until 1947 (with a few notable exceptions in the 19th century before the line was firmly established).

Before 1885 at least three African-American men played in the major leagues: William Edward White, whose light skin color allowed him pass as white, played one game for the Providence Grays in 1879; Moses Fleetwood Walker, an openly Black man who played for the Toledo Blue Stockings of the American Association between May 1 and September 4, 1884; and his brother, Weldy Walker, who played five games with the Toledo club between July 15 and August 6, 1884. Baseball officials essentially drew the color line against Fleetwood Walker. African-Americans had been excluded from major league baseball since 1884 and from white professional minor league teams since 1889. Following the 1891 season, the Ansonia Cuban Giants, a team composed of African-American players, were expelled from the Connecticut State League, the last white minor league to have a Black team.

The Brooklyn Dodgers broke the 63-year color line when they started future Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson at first base on Opening Day, April 15, 1947. The Boston Red Sox were the last team to break the line, when they inserted Pumpsie Green as an eighth-inning pinch runner in a July 21, 1959 game at Chicago.

== Before 1885 ==

== After 1946 ==
=== Overall ===

Below is a list of the first 20 Black players in Major League Baseball since Moses Fleetwood Walker&#x27;s last major league appearance.


=== By team ===

*Teams are listed by franchise; i.e., teams that relocated to a new city after already breaking the color line are not listed a second time.
*Expansion teams that joined the National and American Leagues after 1961 have been integrated from their first game and are not listed.

* Major League Baseball recognizes Curt Roberts as the Pirates&#x27; first Black player; however, Carlos Bernier of Puerto Rico, also a Black man, debuted on April 22, 1953.
‡ Thompson and Irvin broke in with the Giants during the same game on July 8, 1949. Thompson was the starting third baseman, and Irvin pinch hit in the eighth.

<doc id="1073582" wikidata="Q260089" url="?curid=1073582" title="Enns (town)">
<text>Enns () is a town in the Austrian state of Upper Austria on the river Enns, which forms the border with the state of Lower Austria.

Enns was one of the first places in Austria to receive town rights. Its charter dates to 22 April 1212; the document is displayed at the local museum. The date is also depicted on the municipal tower, the landmark of Enns.

== Geography ==
Enns extends for 7.5 km from north to south and 8.6 km from west to east. Its total area is 34.3 km², of which 12.8% are covered with forest, and 64.1% are used for agriculture.

The municipality can be subdivided into the districts of Einsiedl, Enghagen, Enghagen am Tabor, Enns, Ental, Erlengraben, Hiesendorf, Kottingrat, Kristein, Kronau, Lorch, Moos, Rabenberg and Volkersdorf.

== History ==
The first settlements in the area of the mouth of the Enns river to the Danube date back to 4,000 years ago. Celts settled the land around 400 BC. Their kingdom of Noricum was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 15 BC and was designated as a Roman province under the reign of Emperor Claudius in AD 45.

In the second and third century, the Roman camp of &quot;Lauriacum&quot;, in which up to 6,000 soldiers were stationed, was located on the site of modern Enns. The adjacent settlement (today: &quot;Lorch&quot;) received the privileges of a &quot;municipium&quot; in 212 from Emperor Caracalla. At that time about 30,000 people lived here. During the Diocletian Persecution of Christians, a commander of the Roman army, Saint Florian, died as a martyr at &quot;Lauriacum&quot; on 4 May 304, when he was drowned in the Enns river. Only nine years later, the Emperor Constantine I proclaimed religious tolerance with the Edict of Milan. About 370, an Early Christian basilica was built on the remains of a Jupiter temple and &quot;Lauriacum&quot; was the see of a bishop until 488. The present Basilica of St. Lawrence at &quot;Lorch&quot; was built in 1344 on the foundations of the old church 

About 900, the &quot;Enisiburg&quot; fortress, later , was built on the Georgenberg hill to serve as a protective fortress against Magyar invasions. The surrounding settlement prospered from the 12th century onwards, when Ottokar II, Margrave of Styria established a market here. In 1186 the Georgenberg Pact was signed, an inheritance contract between Ottokar IV, Duke of Styria, who lacked a male heir, and the Babenberg duke of Austria, Leopold V. Following the death of Ottokar IV in 1192, his Duchy of Styria — then significantly bigger than the contemporary state, reaching from present day Slovenia to Upper Austria — fell to the House of Babenberg. Thus, Enns became Austrian.

As Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, endowed Enns with town privileges in 1212, it is now considered Austria&#x27;s oldest town (apart from the Roman municipal status). The landmark of Enns, the belfry (municipal tower) on the Main Square, was erected between 1564 and 1568 as a bell tower, watch and clock tower during the reign of emperor Maximilian II.

=== Jews ===
Jewish moneylending in Enns is mentioned by a 1393 contract.

Leopold Löw theorized that the Yiddish term &quot;schlemiel&quot; (&quot;fool&quot;) originated in mockery of Shlomiel of Enns, a 14th-century rabbi. According to Yaakov Levi Moelin (c. 1365–1427), &quot;Shlomiel of Enns once went to study abroad, and his wife gave birth eleven months later. But all agree that she did not cuckold him, given her great piety.&quot; Moelin also recounts that Shlomiel was in mourning one Purim. The Talmud says that a woman can delay giving birth for twelve months if her husband goes away on a trip.

In 1420, a certain Jew in Enns named Israel (perhaps the &quot;Isserlein of Enns&quot; recorded as a Vienna homeowner) was accused of desecrating a host. After obtaining confessions through torture, Albert II seized all Jewish property in Austria and redistributed it to Christians. He then imprisoned, tortured, and forcibly converted the roughly 2,000 Jews of Austria. Those who did not convert, commit suicide, or escape (some 90 men and 120 women) were burned at the stake on 12 March, 1421.

<text>John Howard Davies (9 March 193922 August 2011) was an English director, producer and former child actor. He became famous for appearing in the title role of David Lean&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948). After joining the BBC as a production assistant in 1966, Davies became a hugely influential television director and producer, specialising in comedy.

Davies played a key role in British television comedy across four decades, working variously as the commissioning producer, producer or director on many of the most successful comedy shows of the era, including &quot;The World of Beachcomber&quot;, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;, &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;The Goodies&quot;, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;, &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;. Davies was the producer of all four series of the hit BBC sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot;, and was also responsible for ending Benny Hill&#x27;s television career in the late 1980s.

==Biography==
Davies was born on 9 March 1939 in Paddington, London, the son of Jack Davies, a film critic and prolific scriptwriter for mainly Gainsborough and Elstree studios, and the novelist Dorothy Davies.

Davies was a noted target shooter, competing in fullbore target rifle and 300 metre rifle disciplines. He appeared in the final of HM the Queen&#x27;s Prize in 1994, and represented Wales at the first Commonwealth Shooting Championships in New Delhi, where he claimed a silver medal in the 300 m rifle three positions team event. He competed for Wales in the MacKinnon match 16 times, serving as Team Captain in 1994 and 1995.

==Child actor==
Known to his friends as JHD, his credits as a child actor include the title role at the age of nine in David Lean&#x27;s production &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), followed by &quot;The Rocking Horse Winner&quot; (1949), &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1951) and a few episodes of the TV series &quot;William Tell&quot; (1958).

After a basic education at Haileybury School, he gained further education in Grenoble, France, followed by national service in the Navy.

==Adult career==
After being discharged from the Navy, Davies worked in the City of London financial sector, and then as a carpet salesman. He relocated to Melbourne, Australia, where he returned to acting and met his first wife, Leonie, when they both appeared in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. He was stage manager for &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; for two years touring Australia and New Zealand.

He is best known for his adult career as a director and producer of several highly successful British sitcoms. Returning to the UK, Davies became a BBC production assistant during 1966, and was promoted to producer in 1968. During this early period, Davies worked on sketch shows such as &quot;The World of Beachcomber&quot; (1968); he produced and directed the first four episodes of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969) (as well as defending the series against its detractors within the BBC), as well as the first two seasons of &quot;The Goodies&quot; (1970–72), including the classic &quot;Kitten Kong&quot; episode, which won the Silver Rose of Montreux Eurovision TV award. Davies directed a young Anthony Hopkins in the first episode of the &quot;Biography&quot; series, and also worked on &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; (1969–70) and the seventh series of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; in 1972.

He briefly left the BBC to become managing director of EMI Television Productions in 1973, but soon returned to the corporation. Davies produced and directed the first series of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975). Casting Prunella Scales as Sybil Fawlty was Davies&#x27; idea. The actress originally sought turned down the part. He is also credited with the idea of having the comedic changes to the lettering on the hotel sign in each episode, as well as the slapstick device of having Basil hit Manuel on the head with a spoon. Davies additionally served as producer for &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1975–78).

He was the BBC&#x27;s Head of Comedy from 1977 to 1982, before joining Thames Television in 1985. Thames was then an ITV contractor, for which Davies was head of Light Entertainment from 1988. During the last role, he was cited by the popular press as the man who fired comedian Benny Hill when the company decided not to renew his contract after a connection lasting 20 years. He told Hill&#x27;s biographer Mark Lewisohn, &quot;It&#x27;s very dangerous to have a show on ITV that doesn&#x27;t appeal to women, because they hold the purse strings, in a sense.&quot;

Davies subsequently produced &quot;No Job for a Lady&quot; (1990–1992) and &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; (1990), before returning to the BBC later in the 1990s. His final work was overseeing the Easter Special of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; in 1996.

==Death==
Davies died from prostate cancer on 22 August 2011 at his home in Blewbury, Oxfordshire.

<text>Detling is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Maidstone in Kent, England. The parish is located on the slope of the North Downs, north east of Maidstone, and on the Pilgrims&#x27; Way.

==History and features==
The &quot;Cock Horse Inn&quot; was used to stable additional horses when required to take heavily laden coaches and wagons on the steep route up Detling Hill. The village is now bypassed by the A249 road, which opened in 1962. Jade&#x27;s Crossing, a footbridge to the west of the village, opened in 2002 after a local resident, Jade Hobbs, was killed trying to cross the road.

The Grade I listed village church is dedicated to Martin of Tours.

The former airfield at the top of the hill was a Royal Navy Air Station during World War One, and an RAF station during World War Two. It was bombed by the Luftwaffe several times, with considerable loss of life. Its original area has been divided with some of the original hardstandings being used in a light industrial units area, part of the airfield is now farm land, and a significant part used by the Kent Showground – which hosts a number of annual events, such as the Kent County Show and the Detling Summer Conference, an event for evangelical Christians. A memorial in Detling Village commemorates the service personnel from the airfield. See RAF Detling for more details.

The village is also home to a Tudor gateway that has stood since the time of Henry VIII.

Detling Cricket Club have a ground on the Pilgrims&#x27; Way. They play on Saturdays and Sundays during the summer and hold practice sessions on Tuesday evenings. The team plays in the Kent Village League.

<doc id="1073594" wikidata="Q1124439" url="?curid=1073594" title="Gull-wing door">
<text>In the automotive industry, a gull-wing door, also known as a falcon-wing door, McLaren anhedral door, or an up-door, is a car door that is hinged at the roof rather than the side, as pioneered by Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, first as a race car in 1952 (W194), and then as a production sports car in 1954.

Opening upwards, the doors evoke the image of a seagull&#x27;s wings. In French, they are (butterfly doors). The papillon door was designed by Jean Bugatti for the 1939 Type 64, 14 years before Mercedes-Benz produced its similar, famous 300 SL gullwing door. The papillon door is a precursor to the gullwing door, and is slightly different in its architecture, but is often overlooked when discussing gull-wing design. Conventional car doors are typically hinged at the front-facing edge of the door, with the door swinging outward horizontally.

Apart from the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL of the mid-1950s, the Mercedes-Benz SLS concept, and the experimental Mercedes-Benz C111 of the early 1970s, the best-known examples of road-cars with gull-wing doors are the Bricklin SV-1 from the 1970s, the DMC DeLorean from the 1980s, and the Tesla Model X of the 2010s. Gull-wing doors have also been used in aircraft designs, such as the four-seat single-engine Socata TB series built in France.

== Practical considerations ==
The design is a very practical one in a tight urban parking space. When properly designed and counterbalanced, they require little side-clearance to open (about 27.5 cm or 11&quot; in the DeLorean) and allow much better entrance/egress than conventional doors. The most obvious downside to having gull-wing doors is that, were the car to roll over and come to rest on its roof, exit by the doors would be impossible, requiring a large windscreen opening to escape. The Mercedes SLS solved this problem by fitting explosive bolts in the hinges, which would blow up if the car rolled over, causing the door to fall off altogether.

The Volvo YCC, a concept car designed by and for women, had gull-wing doors as part of its design. Gull-wing doors make it easier to lift a bag to store it behind the driver&#x27;s seat, increase visibility over the driver&#x27;s shoulder, and make it easier to get in and out of the car.

The Tesla Model X, introduced in 2015, has double-hinged gull-wing doors, called falcon-wing doors by Tesla. The Model X has several design considerations to make the doors more practical. Being double-hinged allows them to open with less clearance (horizontal and vertical) than would otherwise be required. The vehicle also has sensors to determine ceiling height and the presence of potential obstacles and to determine how the hinges will operate to open the doors and avoid obstacles, if possible.

== Design challenges ==
Gull-wing doors have a somewhat questionable reputation because of early examples like the Mercedes and the Bricklin. The 300 SL needed the door design, as its tubular frame race car chassis design had a very high door sill, which in combination with a low roof would make a standard door opening very low and small. The Mercedes engineers solved the problem by also opening a part of the roof. The Bricklin was a more conventionally sized door but the actuation system was problematic in day-to-day use and led to unreliable operation until an aftermarket air-door upgrade was installed in all Bricklins. In addition, there was some concern that in making the doors as light as possible they wouldn&#x27;t provide adequate protection in side-impact accidents. There was, however, no indication that this concern was justified.

The DeLorean solved these problems by using a patented cryogenically set stainless steel torsion bar spring (manufactured by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation) to partially counterbalance a full-sized door, and then added a gas-pressurized (pneumatic) strut similar to those found in hatchback cars. The combination of the torsion spring and strut provided the correct torque variation necessary to offset the variable torque of the door, as it opened through a rotational angle of about 80 degrees. The torsion bar is most important in the first foot of movement from the bottom, where the geometry of the strut is pointed at the hinge and therefore at a mechanical disadvantage. As the spring relaxes through the door&#x27;s rotation open, the strut gains a better moment arm and gradually takes over the effort. A correctly balanced door opens fully on its own by simply activating the door latch from the interior, exterior, or from an aftermarket wireless release.

Other disadvantages of the system were not so easy to address. For example, the gull-wing design makes creating a convertible version of the car harder, as the hinges would be removed with the roof, and standard doors would be needed for the convertible. Mercedes did so when replacing the gullwing coupe altogether with the 300SL roadster in 1958. It was never a concern for DeLorean, since no convertible version was ever planned.

It also makes sealing the car against water leaks and snow intrusion more difficult because of the shape and movement path of the door itself.

<doc id="1073602" wikidata="Q2095007" url="?curid=1073602" title="Pilgrims' Way">
<text>The Pilgrims&#x27; Way (also Pilgrim&#x27;s Way or Pilgrims Way) is the historical route supposedly taken by pilgrims from Winchester in Hampshire, England, to the shrine of Thomas Becket at Canterbury in Kent. This name, of comparatively recent coinage, is applied to a pre-existing ancient trackway dated by archaeological finds to 600–450 BC, but probably in existence since the Stone Age. The prehistoric route followed the &quot;natural causeway&quot; east to west on the southern slopes of the North Downs. 

The course was dictated by the natural geography: it took advantage of the contours, avoided the sticky clay of the land below but also the thinner, overlying &quot;clay with flints&quot; of the summits. In places a coexisting ridgeway and terrace way can be identified; the route followed would have varied with the season, but it would not drop below the upper line of cultivation. The trackway ran the entire length of the North Downs, leading to and from Folkestone: the pilgrims would have had to turn away from it, north along the valley of the Great Stour near Chilham, to reach Canterbury.

==History==

The prehistoric trackway extended further than the present Way, providing a link from the narrowest part of the English Channel to the important religious complexes of Avebury and Stonehenge, in Wiltshire, where it is known as the Harroway. The way then existed as &quot;broad and ill-defined corridors of movement up to half a mile wide&quot; and not as a single, well-defined track. The route was still followed as an artery for through traffic in Roman times, a period of continuous use of more than 3000 years.

From Thomas Becket&#x27;s canonization in 1173, until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538, his shrine at Canterbury became the most important in the country, indeed &quot;after Rome...the chief shrine in Christendom&quot;, and it drew pilgrims from far and wide. Winchester, apart from being an ecclesiastical centre in its own right (the shrine of St Swithin), was an important regional focus and an aggregation point for travellers arriving through the seaports on the south coast. It is &quot;widely accepted&quot; that this was the route taken by Henry II on his pilgrimage of atonement for the death of Bishop Thomas, from France to Canterbury in July 1174, although this has been disputed and some evidence points to his having taken a route via London. Travellers from Winchester to Canterbury naturally used the ancient way, as it was the direct route, and research by local historians has provided much by way of detail—sometimes embellished—of the pilgrims&#x27; journeys. The numbers making their way to Canterbury by this route were not recorded, but the estimate by the Kentish historian William Coles Finch that it carried more than 100,000 pilgrims a year is surely an exaggeration; a more prosaic estimate—extrapolated from the records of pilgrims&#x27; offerings at the shrine—contends an annual figure closer to 1,000. A separate (and more reliably attested) route to Canterbury from London was by way of Watling Street, as followed by the storytellers in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer.

Conversely, the concept of a single route called the Pilgrims&#x27; Way could be no older than the Victorian Ordnance Survey map of Surrey, whose surveyor, Edward Renouard James, published a pamphlet in 1871 entitled &quot;Notes on the Pilgrims&#x27; Way in West Surrey&quot;. While acknowledging that the route was &quot;little studied&quot; and that &quot;very many persons in the neighbourhood had not been aware of it&quot;, he nonetheless caused the name to be inserted on the Ordnance Survey map, giving official sanction to his conjecture. Romantic writers such as Hilaire Belloc were eager to follow this up and they succeeded in creating &quot;a fable of...modern origin&quot; to explain the existence of the Way. In fact, the route as shown on modern maps is not only unsuitable for the mass movement of travellers but has also left few traces of their activity. The official history of the Ordnance Survey acknowledges the &quot;enduring archaeological blunder&quot;, blaming the enthusiasm for history of the then Director, General Sir Henry James. However, F. C. Elliston-Erwood, a Kentish historian, notes that tithe records dating from before 1815 use the well established name &quot;Pilgrims&#x27; Way&quot; to reference and locate pieces of land. Earlier still, surviving thirteenth century documents show a &quot;Pilgrim Road&quot; by the walls of Thornham Castle, Kent, on what is today considered the route.

The Pilgrims&#x27; Way is at the centre of the Powell and Pressburger film &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot;, with the camera panning along a map of the route at the start of the film.

==Route==

Anyone walking the &#x27;Pilgrims Way&#x27; from Winchester would have started along the Roman road east following the route through New Alresford, Four Marks, Alton and Bentley to Farnham. This roughly follows the modern A31.

The ancient main streets of towns along the route from Farnham (where the old trackway converges with the pilgrims&#x27; route) through Guildford, Dorking and Reigate align west to east, strongly suggesting that this was the most important route that passed through them. On modern Ordnance Survey maps, part of the route is shown running east from Farnham via the heights by Guildford Castle, then north of the village of Shere, north of Dorking, Reigate, Merstham, Chaldon, Godstone, Limpsfield and Westerham, through Otford, Kemsing and Wrotham, north of Trottiscliffe, towards Cuxton (where it crossed the River Medway). South of Rochester, the Pilgrims&#x27; Way travels through the villages of Burham, Boxley, Detling and continuing in a south-east direction to the north of the villages of Harrietsham and Lenham. The route continues south-east along the top of the Downs past Charing, to Wye and then turns north to follow the valley of the Great Stour through Chilham and on to Canterbury.

Along some stretches the pilgrims&#x27; route left the ancient trackway to encompass religious sites, examples being Pewley Down, near Guildford, where the later way passed St Martha&#x27;s Hill and St Catherine&#x27;s chantry chapel, some 500 metres to the south. At Reigate the thirteenth-century chapel of St Thomas and a hospice were built for the pilgrims&#x27; use, although they were not on the route. Boxley Abbey, with its revered Rood of Grace, was another recognised detour.

==National Trail==
The North Downs Way National Trail parallels the old Pilgrims&#x27; Way between Farnham and Canterbury. Much of the traditional route of the Pilgrims&#x27; Way is now part of the modern road network and the Ramblers have previously advised walkers wishing to follow it to use St. Swithun&#x27;s Way between Winchester and Farnham and the North Downs Way between Farnham and Canterbury as an alternative.

The route also links with the South Downs Way at Winchester.

<text>Number 43 Squadron, nicknamed &quot;the Fighting Cocks&quot;, was a Royal Air Force aircraft squadron originally formed in April 1916 as part of the Royal Flying Corps. It saw distinguished service during two world wars, producing numerous &quot;aces&quot;. The squadron last operated the Panavia Tornado F3 from RAF Leuchars, Scotland, in the air defence role, until it was disbanded in July 2009.

==History==

===First World War===

The squadron was formed at Stirling, Scotland, on 15 April 1916, from No. 18 Reserve Squadron as a unit of the Royal Flying Corps, and was equipped with various types, which it used for training until December 1916 when Sopwith 1½ Strutters arrived. These were taken to the Western Front the following month, where it operated as an Army squadron carrying out fighter reconnaissance duties.

In September 1917, Sopwith Camels arrived, and the squadron undertook ground attack duties; the squadron continued in this vein until the end of the war. It was based at La Gorgue in northern France from 15 January until 22 March 1918.

The squadron received Sopwith Snipe in August 1918 and conversion was completed in October, but the Armistice prevented these playing a major part in the conflict, instead they were taken to Germany for occupation duties until August 1919, when the squadron moved to RAF Spitalgate and was disbanded on 31 December 1919.

During the course of the war, ten aces served in the squadron, including Henry Woollett, Cecil Frederick King, John Lightfoot Trollope, Geoffrey Bailey, Harold Balfour, Charles C. Banks, Hector Daniel, George Lingham, and John Womersley, all surviving the war. ( Robert Johnstone Owen).

===Between the wars===
The squadron was re-formed at RAF Henlow, Bedfordshire, on 1 July 1925, (or 1 July 1923), once again equipped with Sopwith Snipes. In 1926, the squadron converted to Gloster Gamecocks, thus inspiring the squadron badge and the nickname &quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot;. The black and white checkered markings also date from this era. The squadron flew Armstrong Whitworth Siskins from 1928 and received the first production Hawker Fury Mk.I in May 1931.

===Second World War===
Prior to the outbreak of World War II the squadron re-equipped with Hawker Hurricane Mk.Is.

On 3 February 1940, three No. 43 Squadron Hurricanes based at RAF Acklington intercepted and shot down a Luftwaffe Heinkel He 111 bomber at Whitby. The formation was led by Flight Lieutenant Peter Townsend. The other two pilots were Flying Officer &quot;Tiger&quot; Folkes and Sergeant James Hallowes. It was the first German aircraft to fall on English soil in World War II (although it was not the first to be shot down in the United Kingdom, that having occurred in Scotland). Townsend visited the German rear gunner in hospital the next day, and visited him again in 1968 when Townsend was writing his highly-successful book about the Battle of Britain, &quot;Duel of Eagles,&quot; which recounts the incident in detail.

Still flying Hurricanes, the squadron covered the Dunkirk retreat, and fought in the Battle of Britain.

In November 1942, No. 43 Squadron moved to North Africa, now flying Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vcs.

In 1944, as the tide of war turned in favour of the Allies, the squadron moved to France, where it was known by the local French population as &quot;les coqs Anglais&quot;. By then the squadron&#x27;s main role was ground attack, strafing and occasionally dive bombing enemy targets. On 9 September 1944, Wing Commander Barrie Heath, flying Spitfire Mk.IX &quot;MJ628&quot;, led a formation on the squadron&#x27;s first sortie into German territory, strafing motor transport and railway communications.

The squadron ended the war in Austria and was disbanded on 16 May 1947.

===Entering the Jet Age and RAF Khormaksar (1949–1967)===

On 1 February 1949, No. 266 Squadron was renumbered to No. 43 (Fighter) Squadron, flying Gloster Meteor F.4s from RAF Tangmere, Sussex. The squadron moved to RAF Leuchars, Fife, in 1950 and in 1954 became the first to receive the Hawker Hunter F.1, replacing the Meteor F.8. No. 43 (Fighter) Squadron began receiving its first Hunter F.4s on 24 February 1956, before receiving four Hunter F.6s on 2 November 1956 however these were only operated until early December. The Hunters of No. 43 Squadron featured in the 1957 film &quot;High Flight&quot;. The squadron began to receive the Hunter F.6 for the second time on 10 January 1958, these were operated until being replaced by the Hunter FGA.9, which began to arrive in May 1960.

&quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; relocated to RAF Nicosia, Cyprus, in June 1961, before further relocating to RAF Khormaksar, Aden, on 1 March 1963, becoming part of Middle East Command (MEC). Within five days of arrival, No. 43 (F) Squadron was flying sorties in the Beihan region as a show of force against the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, and by the end of the month had managed 264 flying hours. While based at RAF Khormaksar, No. 43 (F) Squadron operated alongside Nos. 8 and 208 Squadrons as part of the Khormaksar Tactical Wing. On 20 June 1963, the squadron sent a detachment of Hunters to Bahrain, relieving No. 8 Squadron, before returning on 22/23 August. &quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; sent another detachment on 24 September, this time to Nairobi, Kenya, with the main purpose being to provide a flying display at the Royal Show, before returning to Khormaksar on 6 October. The squadron briefly relocated to RAF Muharraq, Bahrain, from late December 1963 until late February 1964.
Between April and May 1964, the squadron participated in the Radfan Campaign known as Operation Nutcracker, providing close air support (CAS) for ground troops. On 17 April 1964, Hunter FGA.9 &quot;XG136&quot; crashed while carrying out manoeuvres, killing the pilot Flying Officer Herring. In July 1964, &quot;the Fighting Cocks&quot; had their Hunters pooled with No. 8 Squadron. On 11 August, another Hunter was lost when &quot;XE624&quot; suffered an engine flame out shortly after take-off and couldn&#x27;t be recovered, pilot Fg. Off. Burrows safely ejected. On 18 August, the squadron carried out a strike on the Jabal Fahman mountain where dissidents where supposed to be located. In October 1964 the squadron carried out 15 strikes – 11 in Dhala on the 6th, with the rest in Mudiyah on the 29th. From 8 to 16 October, five pilots from No. 43 (F) Squadron and five from No. 8 Squadron spent a brief deployment with six Hunters at RAF Masirah on Masirah Island, which ended with the loss of Fg. Off. Stephens who was killed after flying into the sea on the return journey to Khormaksar. On 15 November, MEC announced to the squadron that operations in Radfan would be limited to solely providing CAS for the army. Few operational tasks were taken in December 1964, with one of the few sorties being an attack on a gun emplacement at Beihan on the 5th.

In January 1965, sorties increased with an attack being carried out by eight Hunters on 16 January against a dissident camp and supply dump in the Wādī Yahar region. More strikes were carried out on 25, 26 and 29 January. On 11 February, the squadron carried out an 15-ship flypast in the form of a 78 to celebrate No. 78 Squadron being presented its squadron standard. Sorties picked back up in March, with 94 being flown in total, with 80 of these being a response to MiGs from the United Arab Republic Air Force who were entering into Aden&#x27;s airspace. On 8 May, a pair of Hunters carried out a strike on a dissident position near Al-Khuraybah, with another pair attacking a fort destroying an arms dump in the process. Between 10 and 25 June, the squadron deployed to RAF Masirah to undergo a training exercise which included high level reconnaissance sorties over Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, and Muscat, Oman, as well as practising a hypothetical war situation. On 1 September 1965, 13 sorties were flown which saw multiple strikes being carried out against dissidents in the Jabal Khuder region. Operations were briefly suspended for a month on 25 September after the constitution of the Aden Protectorate was suspended by the High Commissioner of Aden Sir Richard Turnbull. The squadron ended the year with a strike being conducted on 31 December in the Wādī Taym area in support of 45 Commando who requested assistance.

On 16 and 29 January 1966, &quot;the Fighting Cocks&quot; flew naval co-operation exercises with HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, which saw 2 versus 2 combat being carried out against de Havilland Sea Vixens. February saw operations being carried out in support of the Special Air Service, with assistance being given on 1st and top cover being provided on 15th. The squadron celebrated its 50th anniversary on 15 April 1966 with three separate flypasts, the first being an 18-ship in the form of a 43. On 11 May, the squadron conducted a strike on two houses in the village of Al-Mazabah which were reported to hold military supplies. On 31 June, four Hunters from No. 43 (F) Squadron launched an attack on dissidents who were preparing to free political prisoners from Jaʿār prison, while caught by surprise the mission was reported as unsuccessful. 106 sorties were flown in August 1966, the most since June 1964, which primarily included shows of force. On 13 September, three strikes were carried out – one on Wādī Bana and a further two on Wādī Yahar, the attacks were launched as a way of dissuasion towards local dissidents. On 28 October, No. 43 (F) Squadron provided top cover for the Irish Guards, HMS &quot;Fearless&quot; and Westland Wessex HC.2s of No. 78 Squadron as part of Operation Fate, which saw an assault on Hawf. December saw a decrease in sorties, with only 26 border patrols, three scrambles and three shows of force.

January 1967 saw less than 20 sorties being carried out, however February saw an increase to 53 sorties – including a twelve-ship strike being launched in Wādī Bana on 24 February. On 15 May, No. 43 (F) Squadron carried out a preemptive strike on an arms shipment in Jabal Al Urays to prevent it from being received by a local dissident leader. The squadron carried out another attack on Wādī Bana on 21 June, using RP-3 high explosive rockets and the Hunter&#x27;s gun pack. August saw &quot;the Fighting Cocks&quot; flying 101 sorties, this included an attack by eight Hunter FGA.9s on the fort at Shurjan, that had been taken over by the National Liberation Movement, which was struck by 89 rockets and 2,940 rounds of ammunition. Sorties ramped up even further in September, seeing 142 missions being flown in total, with up to five air cover sorties being flown each day from the 14 September onwards. On 24 September, six Hunters launched as a show of force to three different forts in Wādī Hadhramaut, which were over 250 miles away from Khormaksar, after the Hadhrami Bedouin Legion called for assistance. October 1967 was the squadron&#x27;s busiest month while based at RAF Khormaksar with a 159 sorties being flown, with an average of 1 hour 40 minutes each. On 14 October 1967, No. 43 (F) Squadron was formally disbanded, marked by a flypast of six Hunters, however operations officially continued up until November when South Yemen was given independence, with the last No. 43 (F) Squadron sortie being carried out on 9 November against rebels in Kirch.

===The Phantom Years (1969–1989)===

No. 43 (Fighter) Squadron received its first McDonnell Douglas Phantom FG.1 (&quot;XT874&quot;) on 6 June 1969 at RAF Leuchars. The squadron officially reformed at Leuchars on 1 September 1969, operating as part of Northern Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). &quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; received the FG.1 (which had an extendable nose wheel oleo strut among a few other differences), as opposed to the FGR.2 operated by other RAF units, due to the cancellation of refit works on HMS Eagle. In November 1970, the squadron deployed eight Phantoms to RAF Luqa, Malta, to participate in Exercise Lime Jug 70, which aimed to improve co-operation between the RAF and Royal Navy.

&quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; deployed ten Phantoms to RAF Luqa between February and March 1973 for an Armament Practice Camp (APC), and were later joined by aircraft from HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. No. 43 (F) Squadron lost its first Phantom on 18 September 1975, when &quot;XV580&quot; lost control during a &#x27;Canadian break&#x27; manoeuvre and crashed near Forfar, Angus, with both crew ejecting. The squadron deployed once again for an APC at Luqa in November 1975, this time operating alongside Avro Vulcans and Avro Shackletons. Between February and March 1978, No. 43 (F) Squadron participated in another APC at RAF Luqa.

On 9 July 1981, the squadron lost Phantom FG.1 &quot;XT866&quot; after an instrument failure on approach to Leuchars which led to a loss of control, both crew safely ejected.

No. 43 (Fighter) Squadron celebrated their 70th anniversary in 1986 by giving Phantom FG.1 &quot;XV571&quot; a special commemorative scheme.

&quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; briefly operated three Phantom FGR.2s (&quot;XV406&quot;, &quot;XV470&quot; and &quot;XV489&quot;) between May 1988 and July 1989. No. 43 (F) Squadron&#x27;s last Phantoms departed Leuchars on 31 July 1989 in preparation for conversion to the Panavia Tornado F.3.

===The Tornado Years (1989–2009)===

The first Tornado F.3s arrived at Leuchars in September 1989. With the Tornado F.3, the squadron participated in the 1991 Gulf War and maintained a presence in the Iraqi no-fly zones. Later, No. 43 (F) Squadron crew and personnel were tasked with QRA duty (short notice air defence &#x27;scrambles&#x27;), both in Fife, and in the Falklands as part of No. 1435 Flight and participated in Operation Telic. The squadron was awarded the &quot;Freedom of the City&quot; of Stirling in 2005, the squadron being Stirling&#x27;s home squadron in the past.

To mark the 90th anniversary of &quot;the Fighting Cocks&quot;, the squadron&#x27;s flagship &quot;ZG757&quot; received an all gloss black paint scheme, which was later reduced to just a gloss black spine and tail and 90th anniversary emblem on the tail.

In April 2008, the squadron absorbed No. 56 (Reserve) Squadron to perform the role of Tornado F.3 Operational Conversion Unit, with No. 56 Squadron reforming in the ISTAR role.

No. 43 (F) Squadron stood down on 13 July 2009 for the fourth time in its history, with it initially rumoured that it would reform as the third operational Eurofighter Typhoon squadron.

The Squadron Standard, presented in person by HM The Queen at RAF Leuchars on 4 June 1957, was laid up on Sunday 22 May 2016 in the Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling, after it was understood the unit would not be reformed as a Typhoon squadron. The No. 43 Squadron Standard is emblazoned with a black gamecock badge on a field of sky blue and surrounded with the following honours: Western Front 1917–1918, Ypres 1917, Somme 1918, Dunkirk, Battle of Britain 1940, North Africa 1942–1943, Anzio and Nettuno, and France and Germany 1944.

==Notable pilots==
* Flight Lieutenant Peter Townsend (later Group Captain) was one of three Hurricane pilots of ‘B’ flight, 43 Squadron, who shot down a Heinkel 111 of 4./KG26 on 3 February 1940, near Whitby, North Yorkshire, the first enemy aircraft to crash on English soil during World War II. His wartime record was 9 aircraft claimed destroyed (and 2 shared), 2 &#x27;probables&#x27; and 4 damaged.
*Squadron Leader John Badger led the squadron during part of the Battle of Britain and destroyed at least ten aircraft.
* Barrie Heath shot down four German aircraft between 1940 and 1941. After the war he went on to become the chairman of the engineering giant GKN.
* S/Ldr Eugeniusz Horbaczewski (Dziubek), Polish Air Force, fought with No. 43 Squadron over Malta, Sicily and Italy 1943. On 4 September he shot down an Fw 190 and on 16 September two Fw 190s. In October, he handed over command and returned to Britain.
*Squadron Leader (Acting) Peter Parrott, famous for being a &quot;poster boy&quot; on a recruitment campaign, and who fought in the Battle of Britain
* Group Captain David Scott: After distinguished service in the operations in Libya, Scott received the only Libya Star presented to a serving officer.
*Group Captain Thomas Dalton-Morgan, DSO, OBE, DFC &amp; Bar, fought with No. 43 Squadron during the Battle of Britain. Credited with 17 confirmed aircraft destroyed before the end of 1943, the true number may be as much as double this as he regularly flew &#x27;off-the-record&#x27; while serving later with the USAAF 4th Fighter Group. Dalton-Morgan is credited with six night kills, the most for an RAF pilot in a single-seat fighter aircraft during the war.
* Pilot Officer Hamilton Upton was the highest scoring Canadian flying ace during the Battle of Britain, destroying eleven German aircraft, one of which was shared with three other pilots.

<text>Stormtroopers ( or &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot;) were the only elite shock troops of the Imperial German Army (Deutsches Heer) that specialized in commando style raids, infiltrating the trenches and wiping out the enemy quickly, maneuver warfare, reconnaissance, and shock tactics. In the last years of World War I, &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot; (&quot;shock troopers&quot; or &quot;shove troopers&quot;) were trained to use infiltration tactics – part of the Germans&#x27; improved method of attack on enemy trench warfare. The German Empire entered the war certain that the conflict would be won in the course of great military campaigns, thus relegating results obtained during individual clashes to the background; consequently the best officers, concentrated in the German General Staff, placed their attention on maneuver warfare and the rational exploitation of railways, rather than concentrating on the conduct of battles. This attitude made a direct contribution to operational victories of Germany in Russia, Romania, Serbia and Italy, but it resulted in failure in the West. Thus the German officers on the Western Front found themselves in need of resolving the static situation caused by trench warfare on the battlefield.

Two concepts can be identified with the attempt to find a solution to the problem. The first was the belief, mainly held by Erich von Falkenhayn, that tactical action alone, the mere killing of enemy soldiers, was a sufficient means to achieve the strategic goal. The second was the idea, emerging from experience of countless &quot;limited target attacks&quot; and forays into the trenches, that combat had become such a difficult task that operational considerations had to be subordinated to tactical ones. The promoter for this last thesis was General der Infanterie Erich Ludendorff who, having become &quot;de facto&quot; commander of the Imperial German Army after the German defeat at the Battle of Verdun, gave decisive support to the development of assault battalions as a solution to resume maneuver warfare.

The creation of these units was the first, and perhaps most innovative, attempt by the German army to break out of the impasse of trench warfare. With the use of well-trained soldiers, commanded by NCOs with autonomous decision-making capacity, an attempt was made to traverse no man&#x27;s land and to break through enemy lines in predefined points in order to allow subsequent waves to liquidate the now confused and isolated opponent, opening large gaps in its defensive systems and then resuming maneuver warfare, which would have allowed Germany to win the conflict.

==History==
===Prior to World War I===
Ever since the introduction of breechloaders, there had been a growing realization that the days of close-order infantry assault were coming to an end. For a time, up to the turn of the 19th century, armies tried to circumvent the problem by moving into range in dispersed formations and charging only the last metres, as the French did in the Second Italian War of Independence (1859), the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War (1866), or the Germans against the French in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71).

The advent of the machine gun and the adoption of hydraulic-recoil artillery was a further setback for close order. The showing of the Boers against the British in the Second Boer War (1899–1902) fanned an enthusiasm for &quot;Boer tactics&quot;: open order tactics reliant more on achieving fire superiority and moving quickly when enemy fire was ineffective than on positioning oneself for the final bayonet charge.

===World War I assault tactics===


In the first part of the war, the standard assault on a trench line consisted of a lengthy artillery barrage all along the line, attempting to smash the enemy positions, followed by a rush forward of infantry in massed lines to overwhelm any remaining defenders. This process either failed, or at most gained only a short distance, while incurring enormous casualties, and the armies settled into trench warfare.

===Development of tactics===

The first experimental pioneer assault unit of the German army formed in the spring of 1915, founded by Major Calsow and later commanded and refined by Hauptmann Willy Rohr. These methods further evolved war tactics originally developed by the Prussians, to form the basis of German infiltration tactics. The troops involved were identified as (literally: &quot;thrust-troops&quot;), and the term was translated as &quot;storm troops&quot; in English.

Allied versions of infiltration tactics were first formally proposed by French Army captain . In 1915, Laffargue published a pamphlet, &quot;The attack in trench warfare&quot;, based upon his experiences in combat that same year. He advocated that the first wave of an attack identify hard-to-defeat defenses but not attack them; subsequent waves would do this. The French published his pamphlet &quot;for information&quot;, but did not implement it. The British Empire armies did not translate the pamphlet, and the British Army continued to emphasise fire power, although Laffargue&#x27;s proposals were gradually adopted informally. The U.S. &quot;Infantry Journal&quot; published a translation in 1916.

The Germans captured copies of Laffargue&#x27;s pamphlet in 1916, translating and issuing it to units, but by this point they already had their own, more sophisticated infiltration tactics, over two months before Laffargue&#x27;s pamphlet was published. The distinction between the German and French tactics was that Laffargue recommended using waves of infantry to attack despite the high casualties that would ensue.

Soldiers were trained to consider fire as a means to facilitate movement in progress. Movement would be a call for fire. N. R. McMahon advocated using combined arms in the attack, particularly light machine guns (some six light and two heavy MGs per battalion) using a decentralised fire control and tactical command system (known as &quot;Auftragstaktik&quot; in German). These methods, suggested in 1909, bore a strong resemblance to the &quot;Stoßtrupptaktik&quot; used by the Germans six years later.

In February 1917, the British Army issued &quot;Manual SS 143&quot; on the subject. The British made the platoon the basic tactical unit rather than the company as in 1916. The platoon was made up of four sections, Lewis Gun, rifle grenade, grenade, and rifle. The new organisation allowed the platoon to make best use of the trench-fighting equipment that had arrived in adequate quantities since the beginning of the Battle of the Somme. They were also supported by sophisticated artillery flash spotting and sound-ranging, something the German Army never perfected, instead relying on the aural method with ever more accurate measuring devices.

==German stormtroopers==
===Calsow Assault Detachment===
The concept of &quot;stormtroopers&quot; first appeared in March 1915, when the Ministry of War directed the Eighth Army to form &quot;Sturmabteilung Calsow&quot; (&quot;Calsow&#x27;s Assault Detachment&quot; or SA Calsow). SA Calsow consisted of a headquarters, two pioneer companies and a 37mm gun (&quot;Sturmkanone&quot;) battery. The unit was to use heavy shields and body armor as protection in attacks.

However, SA Calsow was never employed in its intended role. Instead it was sent into the line in France as emergency reinforcements during heavy Allied attacks. By June, the unit had already lost half its men. Major Calsow was relieved for this, against his protests that it was not his fault that the unit was not used as intended.

===Rohr Assault Battalion===

The new commander of the Assault Detachment from 8 September 1915 was &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (Captain) Willy Rohr, previously commander of the Guard Rifle Battalion. The Assault Detachment was reinforced with a machine gun platoon and flamethrower platoon. The old infantry support guns had been shown to be too difficult to move across the battlefield, and a new model was developed based on captured Russian 76.2mm fortress guns and issued to the Assault Detachment.

Captain Rohr (later promoted to Major), at first experimented with the Assault Detachment&#x27;s body armor and shields, but realized that speed was better protection than armor. The only item of armor kept was the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;, a new model of steel helmet. It later became the standard in all German units by the end of the war, and was used throughout World War II.

The new tactics developed by Captain Rohr, building much on his own previous experiences from the front, was based on the use of squad sized stormtroops (&quot;&quot;Sturmtruppen&quot; or &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot;&quot;), supported by a number of heavy support weapons and field artillery that was to be coordinated at the lowest level possible and rolling up enemy trenches using troops armed with hand grenades. These tactics were tested the first time in October 1915 in a successful assault on a French position in the Vosges Mountains.

In December 1915, the Assault Detachment started training men of other German units in the new assault tactics. Around this time the Assault Detachment also changed some of its equipment to better fit its new requirements. Lighter footwear was issued, and uniforms were reinforced with leather patches on knees and elbows to protect them when crawling. Special bags designed to carry grenades replaced the old belts and ammunition pouches, and the standard Gewehr 98 rifle was replaced with the lighter Karabiner 98a previously used by cavalrymen. The stocked artilleryman&#x27;s pistol/carbine, the 9mm Lange Pistole 08, was also used in concert with an extended 32-round drum magazine to increase the close-range firepower of the unit. The long and impractical épée-style Seitengewehr 98 bayonet was replaced by shorter models, and supplemented with trench knives, clubs, and other melee weapons. While continuing to train other units, the Assault Detachment also participated in many small trench raids and attacks with limited objectives.

The first major offensive led by the new Assault Detachment was the initial German attack at Verdun in February 1916. Stormtroops were in the first wave, leading some units into the French trenches, attacking seconds after the barrage had lifted. This generally worked very well, even though it worked much better against the first trenchline than against the less well-known enemy rear-area.

On 1 April 1916, the Assault Detachment was redesignated &quot;Assault Battalion Rohr&quot;. Around this time it was expanded from two to four pioneer companies. At the same time, several Jäger battalions began retraining as new Assault Battalions.

===Hutier and the last German offensive===
General Oskar von Hutier, now commanding Eighth Army, became a champion of the new tactics, which became known as Hutier tactics in Britain and by the allies.

Hutier suggested an alternative approach, combining some previous and some new attacks in a complex strategy:
# A short artillery bombardment, employing heavy shells mixed with numerous poison gas projectiles, to neutralize the enemy front lines, and not try to destroy them.
# Under a creeping barrage, &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot; would then move forward, in dispersed order. They would avoid combat whenever possible, infiltrate the Allied defenses at previously identified weak points, and destroy or capture enemy headquarters and artillery strongpoints.
# Next, infantry battalions with extra light machine guns, mortars and flamethrowers, would attack on narrow fronts against any Allied strongpoints the shock troops missed. Mortars and field guns would be in place to fire as needed to accelerate the breakthrough.
# In the last stage of the assault, regular infantry would mop up any remaining Allied resistance.

The new assault method had men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down suppressive fire for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics, which were intended to achieve tactical surprise, were to attack the weakest parts of an enemy&#x27;s line, bypass his strongpoints and to abandon the futile attempt to have a grand and detailed plan of operations controlled from afar. Instead, junior leaders could exercise initiative on the spot. Any enemy strong points which had not been overrun by stormtroopers could be attacked by the second echelon troops following the stormtroopers.

===Stormtroopers in 1918===

With the withdrawal of Russia, Germany moved troops from the Eastern Front to reinforce the Western Front. This allowed them to take units out of the line for retraining as stormtroopers.

On 21 March 1918, Germany launched Operation Michael, a major offensive, using the new tactics. Four successive German offensives followed and for the first time in four years the stalemate of trench warfare was broken. However, the German advance failed to achieve the complete breakthrough necessary for a decisive result and in July the Allies began their Hundred Days Offensive.

====Reasons for the failure of the offensive====
Apart from suffering heavy casualties, several other reasons for the failure of the stormtroops have been suggested.

# The initial attack was against the British section of the front, which was the most strongly held.
# The leading units were not relieved or rotated out of action and became exhausted.
# The terrain contained many rivers, towns, forests and canals which slowed the advance.
# The 1918 influenza epidemic.
# The capture of British stores which contained large quantities of alcohol—&quot;not for lack of German fighting spirit, but on account of the abundance of Scottish drinking spirit!&quot;

===3rd and 46th Assault Company===
With three infantry battalions, the German 703rd Infantry Battalion, some machine-gun, cavalry, and artillery units, the 3rd Assault Company, and the 46th Assault Company counterattacked the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. At the First Battle of Amman, during the First Transjordan attack on Amman at the end of March 1918, the attackers were forced back to the Jordan River.

===23rd Assault Detachment===
===24th Assault Company===
With the 3rd Battalion 145th Infantry Regiment (24th Infantry Division) and the 8th and 9th Cavalry Regiments (3rd Cavalry Division), the 24th Assault Company (24th Infantry Division) pushed the Egyptian Expeditionary Force back from Es Salt at the end of April 1918 during the Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt.

===46th Assault Company===
This assault company remained in reserve at Amman during the attack on Es Salt.

===Effect on the Weimar Republic===
According to &quot;Vanguard of Nazism&quot; by Robert G. L. Waite and &quot;Male Fantasies&quot; by Klaus Theweleit, some of the psychological and social aspects of the Stormtrooper experience found their way into the paramilitary wings of every political party during the Weimar Republic, which were largely made up of World War I veterans and younger recruits whom they trained. For example, the formal barrier between officers and enlisted men was largely broken down and replaced by a fierce loyalty. There was also a &quot;brutalization&quot; process owing to the uniquely violent conditions of trench warfare. Such units included the monarchist &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;, the paramilitary Roter Frontkämpferbund wing of the Communist Party of Germany, and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;, the name of which was commandeered by the Nazi Party for its own paramilitary wing.

==Austro-Hungarian assault units==
During the winter of 1914–1915, large parts of the Eastern Front switched to trench warfare. To cope with the new situation many Austro-Hungarian regiments spontaneously formed infantry squads called &quot;Jagdkommandos&quot;. These squads were named after the specially trained forces of Russian army formed in 1886 and were used to protect against ambushes, to perform reconnaissance and for low intensity fights in no-man&#x27;s-land.

Austro-Hungarian High army command (&quot;Armeeoberkommando&quot;, AOK) realised the need for special forces and decided to draw on German experience. Starting in September–October 1916, about 120 officers and 300 NCOs were trained in the German training area in Beuville (near the village of Doncourt) to be the main cadre of the newly raised Austro-Hungarian army assault battalions. The former &quot;Jagdkommandos&quot; were incorporated into these battalions.

==Ottoman stormtroopers==
The formation of a storm battalion was ordered by Enver Pasha, the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Minister of War, in 1917. In May of that year, a cadre of officers and NCOs were given introductory training in assault techniques at Dubliany in occupied Ukraine, prior to the establishment of the &quot;Constantinople Assault battalion&quot; on 1 July at Maltepe, close to the capital. The first troops to arrive for training were deemed to be too old and many were barefoot, so more suitable recruits were selected from other units. With the aid of German instructors, the troops were trained in the use of weapons such as flamethrowers, known to the Turks as &quot;hellfire machines&quot;, and 7.58 cm Minenwerfer mortars. Ottoman troops had never been issued with steel helmets, so German M1916 helmets were ordered but with the visors and neck-guards removed because they were thought to make it difficult to hear orders in the field.

During the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I, especially in Sinai and Palestine Campaign, Ottomans utilized this storm battalion which formed part of the Yıldırım Army Group using the latest Western Front infiltration tactics and close combat gear with concentrated fire of artillery and machine guns. A notable action by this unit was at the Battle of El Burj on 1 December 1917, when they dislodged two squadrons of the 3rd Australian Light Horse from their defensive positions on a ridge, but were halted and isolated when British reinforcements arrived.

<text>Gaius Matius (fl. 1st century BC) (&quot;PW&quot; 1) was a citizen of ancient Rome notable as a friend of Julius Caesar and of Cicero, who described him in a letter to Trebatius (53BC) as &quot;homo suavissimus doctissimusque&quot; (). (Cic. Fam. 7,15,2)

A member of the &quot;gens&quot; Matia, he belonged to the party of Caesar, and helped Cicero in his relationship with Caesar in 49 and 48 BC. After the murder of Caesar, Matius, a dedicated Caesarian, warned of potential for grave repercussions including possible rebellions in Gaul or revolts of Caesar&#x27;s legions. When Octavian came to Rome, Matius became one of his close associates. Matius and Octavian managed the July 44 BC games honoring the recently assassinated dictator. An exchange of letters between Cicero and Matius later in 44 has been preserved (&quot;Letters to Friends&quot;, 11.27 f.).

A Gaius Matius (&quot;PW&quot; 2) is recorded as a friend and assistant of Caesar Augustus, an &quot;eques&quot; who wrote three volumes on gastronomy (Columella credits him with &quot;mincemeat à la Matius&quot; (&quot;minutal Matianum&quot;)), and was said by Pliny the Elder to have invented the clipping of shrubs in topiary. It is unclear however if this is the same person, or a later generation: Ronald Syme supposes the later Matius to be the son of the first.

According to the Real Academia Española, the Spanish word for apple, &quot;manzana&quot; (and thus the related Portuguese &quot;maçã&quot; and Galician &quot;mazá&quot;) derives from &quot;Matiāna mala&quot;, &quot;apples of Matius&quot;. which was mentioned by Pliny and others among fruits that had been recently introduced to Roman tables.

<text>William Thomas Kinkade III (January 19, 1958 – April 6, 2012) was an American painter of popular realistic, pastoral, and subjects. He is notable for achieving success during his lifetime with the mass marketing of his work as printed reproductions and other licensed products by means of the Thomas Kinkade Company. According to Kinkade&#x27;s company, one in every 20 American homes owned a copy of one of his paintings. 

Kinkade described himself as a &quot;Painter of Light&quot;, a phrase he protected by trademark.

Kinkade was criticized for some of his behavior and business practices; art critics faulted his work for being &quot;kitsch&quot;. Kinkade died of &quot;acute intoxication&quot; from alcohol and the drug diazepam at the age of 54.

== Early life==
William Thomas Kinkade was born on January 19, 1958, in Sacramento County, California. He grew up in the town of Placerville, graduated from El Dorado High School in 1976, and attended the University of California, Berkeley, and Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.

Some of the people who mentored and taught Kinkade prior to college were Charles Bell and Glenn Wessels. Wessels encouraged Kinkade to go to the University of California at Berkeley. Kinkade&#x27;s relationship with Wessels is the subject of a semi-autobiographical movie released during 2008, &quot;Christmas Cottage.&quot; After two years of general education at Berkeley, Kinkade transferred to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.

==Career==
During June 1980, Kinkade spent a summer traveling across the United States with his college friend James Gurney. The two of them finished their journey in New York and secured a contract with Guptill Publications to produce a sketching handbook. Two years later they produced a book, &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Guide to Sketching&quot;, which was one of Guptill Publications&#x27; best-sellers that year.

The success of the book resulted in both working for Ralph Bakshi Studios where they created background art for the 1983 animated feature movie &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;. While working on the movie, Kinkade began to explore the depiction of light and of imagined worlds.

After the movie, Kinkade worked as a painter, selling his originals in galleries throughout California.

===Artistic themes and style===

Recurring features of Kinkade&#x27;s paintings are their pastel colors and brilliant illumination of the scene. Rendered with idealistic values of American scene painting, his works often portray bucolic and idyllic settings, such as gardens, streams, stone cottages, lighthouses and Main Streets. His hometown of Placerville (where his works are much displayed) was the inspiration for many of his street and snow scenes. He also depicted various Christian themes, including the Christian cross and churches. His country scenes rarely depict people, a point that he frequently received questions about.

Kinkade said he was emphasizing the value of simple pleasures and that his intent was to communicate inspirational messages through his paintings. A self-described &quot;devout Christian&quot; (even giving all four of his children the middle name &quot;Christian&quot;), Kinkade believed he gained his inspiration from his religious beliefs and that his work was intended to include a moral dimension. Many pictures include specific chapter-and-verse allusions to Bible passages.

In 2009, he painted a portrait of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the cover of that year&#x27;s Indianapolis 500 race program that included details of the crowd, hiding among them the figures of Norman Rockwell and Dale Earnhardt. He also painted the farewell portrait for Yankee Stadium. Concerning the Indianapolis Motor Speedway painting, Kinkade said: 
Artist and Guggenheim Fellow Jeffrey Vallance has spoken about Kinkade&#x27;s devout religious themes and their reception in the art world:

Essayist Joan Didion is a representative critic of Kinkade&#x27;s style:
Didion compared the &quot;Kinkade Glow&quot; to the luminism of 19th-century painter Albert Bierstadt, who sentimentalized the infamous Donner Pass in his &quot;Donner Lake from the Summit.&quot; She saw &quot;unsettling similarities&quot; between the two painters and worried that Kinkade&#x27;s treatment of the Sierra Nevada, &quot;The Mountains Declare His Glory,&quot; similarly ignored the tragedy of the forced dispersal of Yosemite&#x27;s Sierra Miwok Indians during the Gold Rush, by including an imaginary Miwok camp as what he calls &quot;an affirmation that man has his place, even in a setting touched by God&#x27;s glory.&quot;
Mike McGee, director of the CSUF Grand Central Art Center at California State University, Fullerton, wrote of the &quot;Thomas Kinkade Heaven on Earth&quot; exhibition:
===Authenticity===
Kinkade&#x27;s production method has been described as &quot;a semi-industrial process in which low-level apprentices embellish a prefab base provided by Kinkade.&quot; Kinkade reportedly designed and painted all of his works, which were then moved into the next stage of the process of mass-producing prints. It is assumed he created most of the original, conceptual work that he produced. However, he also employed a number of studio assistants to help create multiple prints of his famous oils. Thus while it is believed that Kinkade designed and painted all of his original paintings, the ones collectors were likely to own were printed factory-like and touched up with manual brush strokes by someone other than Kinkade.

Kinkade is reportedly one of the most counterfeited artists, in large part because of advances in affordable, high resolution digital photography and printing technology. Additionally, mass-produced hand-painted fakes from countries such as China and Thailand abound in the U.S. and around the globe. In 2011, the Kinkade studio said that Kinkade was the most collected artist in Asia but received no income from those regions because of widespread forgery.

=== Business ===

Kinkade&#x27;s works are sold by mail order and in dedicated retail outlets. Some of the prints also feature light effects that are painted onto the print surface by hand by &quot;skilled craftsmen,&quot; touches that add to the illusion of light and the resemblance to an original work of art, and which are then sold at greater prices. Licensing with Hallmark and other corporations has made it possible for Kinkade&#x27;s images to be used extensively for other merchandise such as calendars, jigsaw puzzles, greeting cards, and CDs. By December 2009, his images also appeared on Walmart gift cards.

Kinkade was reported to have earned $53 million for his artistic work during the period 1997 to May 2005. About 2000, there was a national network of several hundred Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries; however, they began to falter during the late-2000s recession. During June 2010, his Morgan Hill, California, manufacturing operation that reproduced the art filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing nearly $6.2 million in creditors&#x27; claims. The company, Pacific Metro, planned to reduce its costs by outsourcing much of its manufacturing.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Reception===
Although Kinkade was among the most commercially successful painters of the 1990s, his work has been criticized. Soon after news of Kinkade&#x27;s death in April 2012, author Susan Orlean termed it death of a &quot;kitsch master&quot;. During the same month, journalist Laura Miller lampooned Kinkade&#x27;s work as &quot;a bunch of garish cottage paintings&quot;.

Kinkade was criticized for the extent to which he commercialized his art, for example, by selling his prints on the QVC home shopping network. Some academics expressed concerns about the implications of Kinkade&#x27;s success in relation to Western perceptions of visual art: in 2009, Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;To his detractors, he represents the triumph of sub-mediocrity and the commercialization and homogenization of painting [...] perhaps no other painter has been as shameless or as successful at transforming himself into a corporation as Kinkade.&quot; Among such people, he is known more as a &quot;mall artist&quot; or a &quot;chocolate box artist&quot; than as a merited painter. Rabin later described Kinkade&#x27;s paintings collectively as &quot;a maudlin, sickeningly sentimental vision of a world where everything is as soothing as a warm cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows on a cold December day&quot;.

In a 2001 interview, Kinkade said, &quot;I am really the most controversial artist in the world.&quot;

===Business practices===
Kinkade&#x27;s company, Media Arts Group Inc., was accused of unfair dealings with owners of Thomas Kinkade Signature Gallery franchises. In 2006, an arbitration board awarded Karen Hazlewood and Jeffrey Spinello $860,000 in damages and $1.2 million in fees and expenses due to Kinkade&#x27;s company &quot;[failing] to disclose material information&quot; that would have discouraged them from investing in the gallery. The award was later increased to $2.8 million with interest and legal fees. The plaintiffs and other former gallery owners also made accusations of being pressured to open additional galleries that were not viable financially, being forced to accept expensive, unsalable inventory, and being undersold by discount outlets the prices of which they were not allowed to match. Kinkade denied the accusations, and Media Arts Group had defended itself successfully in previous suits by other former gallery owners. Kinkade himself was not singled out in the finding of fraud by the arbitration board. In August 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the FBI was investigating these issues, with agents from offices across the country conducting interviews.

Former gallery dealers also charged that the company used Christianity to take advantage of people. &quot;They really knew how to bait the hook,&quot; said one ex-dealer who spoke on condition of anonymity. &quot;They certainly used the Christian hook.&quot; One former dealer&#x27;s lawyer stated, &quot;Most of my clients got involved with Kinkade because it was presented as a religious opportunity. Being defrauded is awful enough, but doing it in the name of God is really despicable.&quot; On June 2, 2010, Pacific Metro, the artist&#x27;s production company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, one day after defaulting on a $1 million court-imposed payment to the aforementioned Karen Hazlewood and Jeffrey Spinello. A $500,000 payment had been disbursed previously.

From 1997 through 2005, court documents show at least 350 independently owned Kinkade franchises. By May 2005, that number had more than halved. Kinkade received $50 million during this period. An initial cash investment of $80,000 to $150,000 is listed as a startup cost for franchisees.

===Personal conduct===
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that some of Kinkade&#x27;s former colleagues, employees, and even collectors of his work said that he had a long history of cursing and heckling other artists and performers. The &quot;Times&quot; further reported that he openly fondled a woman&#x27;s breasts at a South Bend, Indiana, sales event, and alleged his proclivity for ritual territory marking by urination, once relieving himself on a Winnie the Pooh figure at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim while saying, &quot;This one&#x27;s for you, Walt.&quot; In a letter to licensed gallery owners acknowledging he might have behaved badly during a stressful time when he overindulged in food and drink, Kinkade said accounts of the alcohol-related incidents included &quot;exaggerated, and in some cases outright fabricated personal accusations&quot;. The letter did not address any incident specifically.

In 2006, John Dandois, Media Arts Group executive, recounted a story that on one occasion six years previously, Kinkade became drunk at a Siegfried &amp; Roy magic show in Las Vegas and began shouting &quot;Codpiece! Codpiece!&quot; at the performers. Eventually he was calmed by his mother. Dandois also said of Kinkade, &quot;Thom would be fine, he would be drinking, and then all of a sudden, you couldn&#x27;t tell where the boundary was, and then he became very incoherent, and he would start cussing and doing a lot of weird stuff.&quot; In June 2010, Kinkade was arrested in Carmel, California, for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was later convicted.

== Related projects and partnerships ==
Kinkade was selected by a number of organizations to celebrate anniversaries, including Disneyland&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Walt Disney World Resort&#x27;s 35th anniversary, Elvis Presley&#x27;s purchase of Graceland 50 years previously and the 25th anniversary of its opening to the public, and Yankee Stadium&#x27;s farewell 85th season in 2008. Kinkade also paid tribute to Fenway Park.

Kinkade was the artist chosen to depict the historic Biltmore House; he also created the commemorative portrait of the 50th running of the Daytona 500 during 2008.

In 2001, Media Arts unveiled &quot;The Village at Hiddenbrooke,&quot; a Kinkade-themed community of homes, built outside of Vallejo, California, in partnership with the international construction company Taylor Woodrow. Salon&#x27;s Janelle Brown visited the community and found it to be &quot;the exact opposite of the Kinkadeian ideal. Instead of quaint cottages, there&#x27;s generic tract housing; instead of lush landscapes, concrete patios; instead of a cozy village, there&#x27;s a bland collection of homes with nothing—not a church, not a cafe, not even a town square—to draw them together.&quot;

==Charities and affiliations==
Kinkade donated to non-profit organizations concerned with children, humanitarian relief, and the arts, including the Make-a-Wish Foundation, World Vision, Art for Children Charities, and the Salvation Army. During 2002, he partnered with the Salvation Army to create two charity prints, &quot;The Season of Giving&quot; and &quot;The Light of Freedom&quot;. Proceeds from the sale of the prints were donated to the Salvation Army for their relief efforts at the World Trade Center site and to aid the victims of the September 11 attacks and their families in New York City, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. More than $2 million was donated as a result of this affiliation.

In 2003, Kinkade was chosen as a National Spokesman for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and during the 20 Years of Light Tour in 2004, he raised more than $750,000 and granted 12 wishes for children with life-threatening medical conditions.

In 2005, the Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging more people more effectively in volunteer service to help solve serious social problems, named Kinkade as &quot;Ambassador of Light&quot;. He was the second person in the Foundation&#x27;s 15-year history to be chosen as Ambassador, the first being the organization&#x27;s founder, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush. During his Ambassador of Light Tour, Kinkade visited cities nationwide to increase awareness and raise money for the Points of Light Foundation and the Volunteer Center National Network, which serves more than 360 Points of Light member Volunteer Centers in communities across the country.

Archbishop Mitty High School of San Jose dedicated the &quot;Thomas Kinkade Center for the Arts&quot; in 2003.

Kinkade was reportedly a member of the Church of the Nazarene.

==Awards and recognition==
Kinkade received many awards for his works, including multiple National Association of Limited Edition Dealers (NALED) awards for Artist of the Year and Graphic Artist of the Year, and his art was named Lithograph of the Year nine times.

In 2002, Kinkade was inducted into the California Tourism Hall of Fame as an individual who had influenced the public&#x27;s perception of tourism in California through his images of California sights. He was selected along with fellow artists Simon Bull and Howard Behrens to commemorate the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and the 2002 World Series. He was also honored with the 2002 World Children&#x27;s Center Humanitarian Award for his contributions to improving the welfare of children and their families through his work with Kolorful Kids and Art for Children.

In 2003, Kinkade was chosen as a national spokesperson for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In 2004, he was selected for a second time by the Christmas Pageant of Peace to paint the National Christmas Tree in Washington, D.C. The painting, &quot;Symbols of Freedom&quot;, was the official image for the 2004 Pageant of Peace.

In 2004, Kinkade received an award from NALED recognizing him as the Most Award Winning Artist in the Past 25 Years. In 2005, he was named the NALED Graphic Artist of the Year. He was also recognized for his philanthropic efforts by NALED with the Eugene Freedman Humanitarian Award.

==In popular culture==
In Heath and Potter&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;The Rebel Sell: Why the Culture Can&#x27;t Be Jammed,&quot; Kinkade&#x27;s work is described as &quot;so awful it must be seen to be believed&quot;. 

In Dana Spiotta&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Stone Arabia&quot;, the main character&#x27;s boyfriend, an art teacher at a private school in Los Angeles, gives Kinkade pieces, which are described as &quot;deeply hideous&quot; and &quot;kitschy&quot;, to others as gifts, explaining his rationale for this by saying, &quot;Well, he is America&#x27;s most successful artist. And a native Californian as well.&quot; At another point he says, &quot;His name has a trademark — see?&#x27; and he would point to the subscript that appeared after his name.&quot;

Mat Johnson&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Pym&quot; includes a parody of Kinkade named Thomas Karvel, &quot;the Master of Light&quot;.

A self-produced movie about Kinkade, &quot;Thomas Kinkade&#x27;s Christmas Cottage,&quot; was released on DVD in late November 2008. The semi-autobiographical story examines the motivation and inspiration behind his most popular painting, &quot;The Christmas Cottage.&quot; Jared Padalecki plays Kinkade and Marcia Gay Harden plays his mother. Peter O&#x27;Toole plays young Kinkade&#x27;s mentor, who tells him, &quot;Paint the light, Thomas! &quot;Paint the light!&quot;.&quot;

In &quot;Mother&quot;, a fifth season episode of the TV series &quot;Veep&quot;, Selina Meyer discusses her mother, Mee-Maw, with her daughter, Catherine. Selina makes a disparaging comment about Mee-Maw, and Catherine asks: &quot;Mom, why would you want to paint Mee-Maw in such a negative light?&quot; Selina answers, &quot;Oh, Catherine, Thomas-fucking-Kinkade couldn&#x27;t paint Mee-Maw in a positive light!&quot;

Bob Odenkirk references Thomas Kinkade on his 2014 comedy album &quot;Amateur Hour&quot;. On the track &quot;The Kids&quot;, Odenkirk includes Kinkade&#x27;s paintings in a litany of things he encourages his children to appreciate when in reality he wants them to reject when they are older. In June 2012, a month after Kinkade&#x27;s death, Bob Odenkirk&#x27;s brother, Bill Odenkirk, wrote a poem, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, in acknowledgement of his passing.

== Personal life ==
Kinkade married Nanette Willey in 1982, and the couple had four daughters: Merritt (b. 1988), Chandler (b. 1991), Winsor (b. 1995) and Everett (b. 1997), all named for famous artists. He and his wife had been separated for more than a year before his death in 2012.

==Death and legacy==
Kinkade died in his Monte Sereno, California, home on April 6, 2012, at age 54. He is buried at Madronia Cemetery in Saratoga, California.

Kinkade&#x27;s family said initially that he appeared to have died of natural causes. It was reported after an autopsy that he died of &quot;acute intoxication&quot; from alcohol and diazepam (Valium). In corroboration with the autopsy, according to Amy Pinto-Walsh, his girlfriend of 21 months, Kinkade had been at home drinking alcohol the night prior to his death. Pinto-Walsh stated that the artist &quot;died in his sleep, very happy, in the house he built, with the paintings he loved, and the woman he loved.&quot;

After Kinkade&#x27;s death, his wife sought a restraining order against his girlfriend to prevent her from publicly releasing information and photos with respect to Kinkade, his marriage, his business, and his personal behavior that &quot;would be personally devastating&quot; to Kinkade&#x27;s wife. By the end of the year, in December 2012, Nanette Kinkade and Amy Pinto-Walsh announced they had reached a private agreement.

<doc id="1073628" wikidata="Q6675675" url="?curid=1073628" title="Looney Tunes Golden Collection">
<text>The Looney Tunes Golden Collection is a series of six four-disc DVD sets from Warner Home Video, each containing about 60 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated shorts originally released from the 1930s to 1960s. The initial run of the series was in folding cardboard packaging issued gradually from October 28, 2003, to October 21, 2008. A boxed set combining all six volumes was released in 2011, and each volume was reissued separately in standard Amaray-style cases in 2020.

==Overview==
The &quot;Golden Collection&quot; series was launched following the success of the &quot;Walt Disney Treasures&quot; series which collected archived Disney material.

These collections were made possible after the merger of Time Warner (which owned the color cartoons released from August 1, 1948, onward, as well as the black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, the post-Harman/Ising black-and-white &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; and the first H/I &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; entry &quot;Lady, Play Your Mandolin!&quot;) and Turner Broadcasting System (which owned the color cartoons released prior to August 1, 1948, and the remaining Harman/Ising &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;; most of these cartoons had been released as part of &quot;The Golden Age of Looney Tunes&quot; laserdisc series), along with the subsequent transfer of video rights to the Turner library from MGM Home Entertainment to Warner Home Video.

The cartoons included on the set are uncut, unedited, uncensored, and digitally restored and remastered from the original black-and-white and successive exposure Technicolor film negatives (or, in the case of the Cinecolor shorts, the Technicolor reprints). However, some of the cartoons in these collections are derived from the &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; reissues (altered from their original versions with their revised front-and-end credit sequences), as the original titles for these cartoons are presumably lost. Where the original titles, instead of the &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; titles, still exist, Warner has taken the &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; titles out.

A handful of cartoons in the first two collections and the bonus cartoons on Volume 6 have digital video noise reduction (DVNR) artifacting. The noise reduction process sometimes unintentionally erases or blurs some of the picture on certain scenes of the cartoons, which has caused controversy among some Looney Tunes fans. The most recent collections, however, lack such artifacting. Since August 2007, Warner Home Video has been quietly reissuing copies of the fourth disc of Volume 2 that lacks artifacting and interlacing because of numerous complaints by consumers.

Beginning with Volume 3, a warning was printed on the packaging explaining that the collection is intended for adults and the content may not be suitable for children (except for Volume 6, which states that it &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot; suitable for children). This goes along with Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s filmed introduction in Volume 3 which explains the history of ethnic imagery that frequently appears in cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s. Beginning with Volume 4, a singular disclaimer text card similar to Goldberg&#x27;s spoken disclaimer precedes each disc&#x27;s main menu. This is seen on the &quot;Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection&quot; discs and even on the back of the &quot;Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection&quot; discs (though for the latter, they are from Universal, not Warner Bros.).

The DVDs also feature several special features including interviews/documentaries of the people behind the cartoons such as Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett, Tex Avery, Robert McKimson, Chuck Jones, musical conductor Carl Stalling and voice-artist Mel Blanc, pencil tests, and audio commentaries by animation historians Jerry Beck, Michael Barrier and Greg Ford, as well as current animators Paul Dini, Eric Goldberg and John Kricfalusi and voice actors Stan Freberg and June Foray. In addition to the appearances by the above-mentioned, there is interview footage of Stan Freberg, June Foray, Noel Blanc, Billy West, Keith Scott, Mark Evanier, Bob Bergen, Joe Alaskey, Bill Melendez, Willie Ito, Corny Cole, Peter Alvarado and the children of the various directors: Robert McKimson Jr., Ruth Clampett, Sybil Freleng and Linda Jones. Audio footage of Mel Blanc in recording sessions is heard as a bonus feature on several of the discs, as is an obscure audio clip of Arthur Q. Bryan rehearsing a line as Elmer Fudd in &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;. In total, there are 356 cartoons (18 more than &quot;The Golden Age of Looney Tunes&quot;) spread throughout the six volumes.

In some regions, such as Regions 2 and 4, each disc in each volume is packaged (or re-packaged) separately. In this format, it was titled &quot;Looney Tunes Collection&quot; omitting &#x27;Golden&#x27; from the title. There were no boxes to group the various volumes, and no numbering on the spine of each individual cover, so storage order was not easily maintained.
The Region 1 box set has since been released in Regions 2 and 4.

==Re-release==
On December 27, 2011, Warner re-packaged all volumes in a single boxed set. From January through June 2020, each volume was reissued separately in standard Amaray-style cases.

==Other DVD releases of Looney Tunes==

===&quot;Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection&quot;===

Concurrently with the &quot;Golden Collection&quot;s, Warner Home Video also released the &quot;Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection&quot;, each volume of which packaged half of the cartoons of a &quot;Golden Collection&quot;, on two DVDs. The exception to this practice was in 2005, with Warner Home Video instead releasing the somewhat-misnamed &quot;Looney Tunes Movie Collection&quot;, which featured DVDs containing &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot; and &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot;.

===&quot;Looney Tunes Super Stars&quot;===

In November 2009, it was reported that two new single-disc DVD releases, with 15 cartoons each, would be released in April 2010. It was also reported that these 30 cartoons would not contain any duplicates that had already been released as part of the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; releases. This series of DVDs is called &quot;Looney Tunes Super Stars&quot; and the first two titles are &quot;Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinaire&quot; and &quot;Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl&quot;. These new DVDs still have the cartoons digitally restored and remastered - in addition to being shown uncut and uncensored. A second set of Looney Tunes Super Stars DVDs was released on November 30, 2010. The titles in the second wave are &quot;Foghorn Leghorn &amp; Friends: Barnyard Bigmouth&quot; and &quot;Tweety &amp; Sylvester: Feline Fwenzy&quot; (which featured a collection of 15 previously on-DVD shorts).

Some viewers noted discs of the first wave proved to be cropped and distorted and otherwise poorly restored to present the shorts in &quot;widescreen&quot; as opposed to their original aspect ratio (though these were just for the post-1953 shorts). Warner Bros. stated the reason for this was that all post-1953 WB shorts were shown in matted-widescreen in theaters.

On December 1, 2010, animation expert Jerry Beck explained on the Shokus Internet Radio call-in talk program, &quot;Stu&#x27;s Show&quot; that Warner aimed this series not at collectors, but at the mass market who expect it to fit on their widescreen TVs. He speculated that at some point down the road there will probably be a release of those shorts in a collector&#x27;s DVD version with the video in fullscreen format. However, the Foghorn Leghorn disc contains both the matted-widescreen versions and the original fullscreen (and will most likely continue for future waves featuring new-to-DVD shorts). Jerry Beck stated on &quot;Stu&#x27;s Show&quot; on December 1, 2010, that 2011 would see new &quot;Super Stars&quot; releases, such as a release titled &quot;Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote&quot; (which features new-to-DVD shorts), another Sylvester release titled &quot;Sylvester and Hippety Hopper&quot; (with more new-to-DVD shorts) and another Bugs release (with double dips).

===&quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection&quot;===

Another new series, &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection&quot;, was released on Blu-ray. The first volume was released on November 15, 2011. A 2-disc DVD version of the &quot;Platinum Collection&quot; was made available on July 3, 2012. The first two discs overlap with releases from the &quot;Golden&quot; and &quot;Super Stars&quot; collections. Two more volumes were released on Blu-ray and DVD in the following years.

=== &quot;Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: The Chuck Jones Collection&quot; ===
In 2012, Warner Home Video released a 2-Disc Blu-Ray and DVD set titled &quot;Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: The Chuck Jones Collection&quot; that contained both Sniffles and Hubie and Bertie&#x27;s entire filmography.

===&quot;Porky Pig 101&quot;===
In 2017, Warner Archive released a 5-disc DVD set called &quot;Porky Pig 101&quot; featuring the first 101 cartoons of Porky Pig&#x27;s filmography.

===&quot;Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection&quot;===
In 2020, Warner Home Video released a 3-Disc Blu-ray Disc set collecting 60 Bugs Bunny cartoons, all digitally restored in HD, including 40 cartoons previously unavailable on DVD or Blu-ray Disc.

===&quot;Looney Tunes Collector&#x27;s Choice&quot;===
In January 2023, Warner Archive announced they would be releasing newly restored to disc shorts via the single disc Looney Tunes Collector&#x27;s Choice series, with the first volume releasing on May 30, 2023.

==Available shorts==

This is a listing of the shorts in the Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series currently available on the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; DVDs, and its successors: &quot;Looney Tunes Super Stars&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection&quot; &quot;Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: The Chuck Jones Collection&quot;, &quot;The Essential Bugs Bunny&quot;, &quot;The Essential Daffy Duck&quot;, &quot;Porky Pig 101&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes Collector&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

=== Additional cartoons included as Special Features ===

In addition to the main Looney Tunes DVD and Blu-Ray collections, many cartoons have been released as bonus cartoons on miscellaneous DVDs by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Some Looney Tunes collections like &quot;Golden Collection: Volume 6&quot; and &quot;Mouse Chronicles&quot; included unrestored cartoons as extras.

<text>Dunton Green is a small village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It lies in the valley of the River Darent, north of the town of Sevenoaks. Dunton Green is designated as being part of the Kent Downs area of outstanding natural beauty, due to its proximity to the North Downs. The original ecclesiastical church parish of Dunton Green was part of Otford parish. The former parish church was dedicated to St John the Divine.

From at least the 17th century, Dunton Green was a centre for making bricks and tiles. In 1862, the &quot;Dunton Green Brick, Tile and Pottery Works&quot; was established: a large concern with clayholes or pits, kilns and an engine house. While clay was being dug for, many fossils were discovered.

==Places of worship==
St John the Divine&#x27;s Church, the Anglican parish church, was designed by M.T. Potter and built in 1889–90 using local bricks. It was declared redundant in 1987 after congregations declined, and is now in commercial use. The village Anglican church is now St Mary&#x27;s, Riverhead and its distinctive green copper spire can be seen rising up in the distance from the village. Dunton Green Free Church opened in 1873 in a building which later became the Bethel Free Church, associated with the Assemblies of God Pentecostal denomination. The Free Church moved to a new building on Station Road, opened in September 1937. Still with its original name, it remains open and is a member of the Congregational Federation.

<text>Dymchurch is a village and civil parish in the Folkestone and Hythe district of Kent, England. The village is located on the coast five miles (8 km) south-west of Hythe, and on the Romney Marsh.

==History==
The history of Dymchurch began with the gradual build-up of the Romney Marsh.

New Hall was rebuilt in 1575 after an earlier wooden structure was destroyed in a fire. It was used as a court room for the Romney Marsh area. The head magistrate was known as Leveller of the Marsh Scotts. It was there that the so-called Scot tax was introduced, levied on residents to fund maintenance of the sea wall. Those directly outside the boundaries and thus not eligible for the tax were said to have got away &quot;scot free&quot;.
Residents with land were required to grow thorn bushes for building of the wall, as thorn twigs were believed impervious to sea water. Failure resulted in an ear being cut off.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, smuggling was rife all along the south-east coast of England. Due to its remote location, Romney Marsh and the surrounding areas were amongst the busiest locations for illicit trade. This inspired Russell Thorndike to set his &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; smuggling novels in Dymchurch. Every two years a celebration of the novels is held, usually on August Bank Holiday.

Dymchurch played a significant rôle in the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which linked the Royal Greenwich Observatory with the Paris Observatory using trigonometry. There were two baselines for the English part of the survey, on Hounslow Heath and on Romney Marsh. The Romney Marsh base-line extended from Ruckinge to High Nook, on the sea-wall near Dymchurch.

===Dymchurch Martello towers===

Several Martello towers were built in the nineteenth century as part of an Empire-wide coastal defence programme: most have since fallen into the sea or become dilapidated. Tower 23 was restored externally in the early 1970s and is currently a private residence. Tower 24 has undergone renovation and using Tower 23 used as a guide: in 1969 it became the first Martello tower to be opened to the public and remains as a museum of Martello Towers, owned by English Heritage. Tower 25 is possibly the only empty tower that is regularly maintained.

===Dymchurch Redoubt===

Two redoubt forts were constructed into the south coast Martello chain to act as supply depots for the local Martellos, and were originally described as &quot;eleven-gun towers&quot;. A four-gun tower was originally proposed at Dymchurch, but this idea was revised at the Rochester conference of 1804. Dymchurch Redoubt was built between 1806 and 1809 to the same specifications as its Eastbourne counterpart, although Dymchurch does not have any caponiers. A caponier is a type of fortification structure. The word originates from the French word caponnière. It is a type of fortification structure which allows firing along the bottom of a dry moat that surrounds the main fortress.

In 1908, Walter Jerrold described the village as &quot;a quiet scattered village and a delightful place far from the madding crowd&quot;. It is typical of this part of the coast, having originally been a very small village which became a much larger settlement during the 1930s. Many of homes from this era were converted railway carriages: very few of these remain, although a few similar ones still exist in nearby Dungeness. Dymchurch is now a popular seaside resort complete with holiday camp, caravan parks, light railway station and amusement park. Today the village is relatively large and mainly dedicated to seasonal tourism.

==Second World War==

*On 24 August 1940, Dymchurch was bombed and the first local people were killed by enemy action, Alfred and Ada Austin. Their house, Sea Breeze, was rebuilt.
*The Observer Corps used Martello Tower 25 as a vantage post and it was from there, later in the war that the first V-1 flying bomb to fly over England was spotted.
*In 1942, the primary school suffered a direct hit from a bomb dropped from a plane. The teacher and pupils had escaped to the bomb shelter, and there were no reported casualties. In February 1944 a USAF Flying Fortress developed engine trouble while returning from a bombing raid and crashed into the police station, damaging several neighbouring houses in Lyndhurst Road. A soldier was killed and three people injured.
*In May 1944, 22 soldiers were killed by the explosion of anti-tank grenades at Dymchurch. The cause of the explosion was uncertain; at the inquest it was suggested that it may have been the heat of the sun, or a match-head falling into a box of detonators.
*Dymchurch underwent significant re-fortification during the Second World War, with bunkers and pillboxes. The gun platforms were encased in concrete for machine guns to be mounted, artillery emplacements constructed and an observation post erected. On the western extreme of the Hythe Ranges, during the 1970s the Redoubt was being used by the British Army for training soldiers for urban combat. The ranges remain in the possession of the Ministry of Defence.

==Governance==
Dymchurch is part of the electoral ward of Dymchurch and St Mary&#x27;s Bay. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 6,291. In 2018, Thomas Quaye was elected to the Parish Council.

==Famous residents and cultural connections==
In January 1867, the &quot;Courier de Dieppe&quot; was spotted foundering in a gale off Dymchurch, with the crew clinging to the rigging and one by one dropping off into the sea. After repeated attempts, a line was thrown to the boat, but by this time there was only one of its crew left. The Reverend Charles Cobb, rector of the parish, volunteered to swim to the boat to try to save the last man. Encouraged by his wife and the gathered crowd, he dived into the troubled waters and swam the 50 feet or more to the vessel. He was then joined by a local coastguard, John Batist. Together they reached the trapped man, and managed to carry and drag him back to shore, where they received much applause for their heroism. The rescued man was the only survivor of a crew of four from the ship. Cobb was awarded the Albert Medal of the First Class and Batist was awarded the Albert Medal of the Second Class. The street nearest to where this heroic action occurred was later named &quot;Charles Cobb Close&quot; in his memory.

The artist Paul Nash settled in Dymchurch in 1919, and lived there for a number of years, painting a number of important paintings, as well as producing lithographs and wood engravings, based on the sea wall and the surrounding countryside.

Dymchurch is the setting for the opening and concluding scenes of 1964 film First Men in the Moon, although these sequences were not actually filmed in the town, nor on the Moon.

==Transport==
The main road into the village is the A259.

The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway was originally opened in the 1920s, but closed temporarily during the Second World War. Dymchurch railway station was reopened after the war by Laurel and Hardy.

===Bus routes===
Three main bus routes serve the area: the 100, 101 and 102 Dover to Lydd-on-Sea or Hastings via Lydd, operated by Stagecoach.

== Tourism ==

===Beach===
Dymchurch has a blue flag awarded sandy beach and is surrounded by flat countryside that is well suited to walking and cycling. It has two nearby holiday parks, and an amusement park with &quot;the usual offering of Ghost Train, Dodgems, Log Flume and other rides which will keep the whole family entertained&quot;.

====The Dr Syn Books====

Russell Thorndike, the creator of Doctor Syn, was born on 6 February 1885 in Rochester, Kent.

Thorndike was a British actor and novelist, best known for the Dr Syn of Romney Marsh novels, and brother of renowned actress Dame Sybil Thorndike. Thorndike&#x27;s first appearance on stage was in Cambridge in 1904.

In 1914, Thorndike joined the army as a trooper in the 1st Westminster Dragoons, but due to being severely wounded at Gallipoli in 1916, he was discharged and returned to acting.

Touring the US with his sister and a theatrical company, a murder took place outside their hotel. The body was left all night on the street below their window. Unable to sleep, they passed the time by telling stories. The character of Dr Syn is said to have been created that night.

Due to his successful life as both a Shakespearean actor, a writer and playwright, in 1922 Thorndike played the leading man in his own Dr Syn play, which he adapted from his books.

During his lifetime, Thorndike created and published seven Dr Syn novels; he died on 7 November 1972.

Several films featuring Dr Syn were made in and around Dymchurch, including &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; (1937) with George Arliss, &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; – the lead character was renamed for legal reasons (1962) featuring Peter Cushing, and the Disney TV film &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh (1963)&quot; with Patrick McGoohan.

Russell Thorndike was buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Dymchurch.

=== RH&amp;DR ===
There is a railway station here, with frequent steam trains running along the Romney Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway.

==Sea defences==
Dymchurch has had a sea wall since Roman times, with the original development being constructed to protect the harbour at Port Lympne. The original structure is believed to have run for some 4 miles and to have stood 20 ft high. This wall, together with the Rhee Wall erected between New Romney and Appledore, ensured that the rich alluvial land deposited by the river Limen (Rother) which had initially been used as salt pans, slowly became rich and fertile farmland.

In July 2011, a new sea wall, built at a cost of £60 million, was officially opened by Chris Smith, Chairman of the Environment Agency. He announced that &quot;the scheme was implemented by the Environment Agency as part of the wider Folkestone to Cliff End Sea Defence Strategy, the sea defence project which will protect 2,500 properties from flooding. The high cost of flooding underlines the importance of investment in reducing flood risk.&quot; He also added &quot;The agency said storms and raised sea levels are due with climate change.&quot;

The wall between the High Knocke Estate and Dymchurch won a British Construction Industry Award in 2011.

The new wall allows pedestrians to walk the sea shore for the entire length of the village, approximately four miles, from Hythe Military Rifle Ranges in the East to St Mary&#x27;s Bay Boundary in the West. Cyclists have the same freedom but must dismount for about 500m around the area of the public amenities.

==Population==
The population has grown due to large development since 2001 and is estimated at 5820 (Est 2004). The village has one primary school which was rated &quot;requires improvement&quot; by ofsted in 2018. The proportion of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals is broadly average. Most pupils are of White British heritage. The proportion of pupils from minority ethnic heritages is much lower than average, as is the percentage who speak English as an additional language. The proportion of pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities is broadly average, although in some year groups it is much higher. The school caters for children in the Early Years Foundation Stage in a Reception class. The school has about 180 pupils. (Source: OFSTED Report 2011)

==Buildings of note==

===The Norman church in Dymchurch===
Dedicated to St Peter &amp; St Paul, is classic Norman, built in about 1150. The first recorded rector was Richard de Bello in 1260. The church remained virtually unchanged for nearly 700 years. In 1821 the population of Dymchurch increased to the point where extensions and modifications were required, and the north aisle was extended and the nave re-roofed giving the church its present lop-sided appearance.

====Commonwealth War Grave====
The village holds one war grave from the Second World War – 1074227 Gnr Arthur William Heyhoe, 519 Coast Rgt, Royal Artillery, who is the only soldier buried in the Dymchurch cemetery under a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone. Arthur died, on 20 November 1940 his 28th birthday. He was serving as an anti-aircraft artillery Gunner overnight at Dover, and on the regrouping of his Battery in the morning, he was found to be &#x27;Missing In Action&#x27;, &#x27;MIA&#x27;.
His body was found later that day, having washed up on the beach at Dymchurch very close to where he is now laid to rest. 

Arthur is also remembered on the war memorial at Tilney St Lawrence, Wisbech, Norfolk. Arthur&#x27;s birth was recorded in Mitford, Norfolk. The local Branch of the Royal British Legion remember him every year.

==Local media==

===Newspapers===
Dymchurch has two paid-for newspapers, the &quot;Romney Marsh Herald&quot; (published by Kent Regional News and Media) and the &quot;Kentish Express&quot; (published by the KM Group). Free newspapers for the area include the &quot;Folkestone and Hythe Extra&quot;, part of the KM Group, and &quot;Your Shepway&quot;, part of KOS Media.

===Radio===
The local radio station for Dymchurch is KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country. The area is also served by the county-wide stations Heart South, Gold and BBC Radio Kent. Cinque Ports Radio 100.2FM is the community radio station for Romney Marsh, Hythe and Rye and has been broadcasting since 7 March 2022. This replaced Shoreline FM which broadcast since January 2020 and is now an online radio service for Romney Marsh called Shoreline Easy

<text>Hollingbourne is a village and civil parish in the borough of Maidstone in Kent, England. The parish is located on the southward slope of the North Downs to the east of the county town, Maidstone. The parish population is around 900 and has three conservation areas: Upper Street in the village centre and the outlying hamlets of Broad Street and Eyhorne Street.

==Geography==
The village is four miles (6.4 km) from Maidstone. Its church is dedicated to All Saints. 
Hollingbourne railway station, on the Maidstone-Ashford line, serves the village. There is also a bus connecting Hollingbourne to Maidstone.

The North Downs Way National Trail passes through the village, as does the Pilgrims&#x27; Way, an ancient trackway historically associated with pilgrimage routes to Canterbury. The village has two large public houses.

Hollingbourne Hill was a major measuring point in the trigonometric survey linking the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory. The Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) was led by General William Roy. It was also the origin (meridian) of the 6-inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Kent.

The parish hosts (adjacent to the historic village) part of the M20 motorway and the High Speed 1 rail link to the Channel Tunnel, and residents in 2007 joined forces with the neighbouring village of Bearsted in voicing their objections to the proposed Kent International Gateway development. The plans after a planning inspectorate appeal were in 2011 rejected by the government. Maidstone services lie within the parish on the north side of the motorway.

==History==

===Hollingbourne village centre===
Hollingbourne appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Hoilingeborde&quot;. It was held partly by the Archbishop of Christ Church, Canterbury and partly by Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Its Domesday assets were: 24 ploughs, of meadow, woodland/herbage worth 40 hogs, two mills and one church. It rendered £30.

All Saints’ Church is a Grade I listed building, made of flint and stone, parts dated 14th, 15th and 17th centuries. Within the church are monuments and stone tombs to Francis Culpeper, d. 1591 and his wife Johanna Culpeper, d. 1597, Martin Barnham d. 1610, Baldwin Duppa d. 1737, Samuel Plummer, d. 1705, Dame Grace Gethin, d. 1697, Philippa Culpeper, d. 1630, Elizabeth Culpeper, d. 1638 (freestanding chest tomb with white effigy) John, Lord Culpeper, d. 1660, erected 1695, Cheney Colepeper, 4th Lord Culpeper, d. 1725, the latter were among the governing Virginia/ North Carolina Culpeper family and were major landowners in the village for many generations.

===Eyhorne Street===
This hamlet in the southwest of Hollingbourne parish has the Grove Mill House downstream on the Hollingbourne and its own conservation area. It has no church and has always been part of the parish. There are 26 Grade II listed buildings and one Grade II* listed building is shown on maps as restored Godfrey House.; its listing describes it as 16th century, restored 1859, timber framed with plaster infilling, 10-light ovolo-moulded mullioned and transomed oriel window with moulded cornice and plastered ogee base immediately below each eaves dormer, and one of six lights to first floor of porch, three rectangular ground-floor bays with 10-light ovolo-moulded mullioned and transomed windows on stone bases. Totnams was an ancient farm in the Eyhorne district, and is now the site of Grade II listed Cotuams Hall.

=== Colepeper / Culpeper Cloth ===

The church is best known for the centuries-old &#x27;Culpeper cloth&#x27;, sometimes described as an altar cloth although it is probably too large to have served that function; several books attribute it to the four daughters of Sir John Culpeper, Lord of Greenway Court. It may in fact have been a funeral pall.

Hollingbourne Manor, a former home of members of the Culpeper family, is a Grade I listed Elizabethan manor house, located at the foot of Hollingbourne Hill. Cotuams House in Eythorne Street was also owned by the family.

==Governance==
Hollingbourne in elections every four years elects one representative to Kent County Council, this is currently:

Hollingbourne elects one representatives to Maidstone Borough Council, currently:

<text>La Prairie (; previously known as Laprairie) is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1896, 1968 to 1997 and again since 2015.

==History==
The riding of Laprairie was created by the British North America Act of 1867. It consisted of the Parishes of Laprairie, Saint-Philippe, Saint Jacques le Mineur, Saint Isidore and Saint Constant, the Indian Lands of Sault Saint Louis, and all islands in the River Saint Lawrence close to the county. It was abolished in 1892 when it was redistributed into the Châteauguay and Laprairie—Napierville electoral districts.

The riding was re-created in 1966 from Beauharnois—Salaberry and Châteauguay—Huntingdon—Laprairie ridings. It consisted of:
* the City of Saint-Lambert;
* the Towns of Brossard, Candiac, Châteauguay, Châteauguay-Centre, Châteauguay Heights, Delson, Greenfield Park, La Prairie, LeMoyne, Léry and Préville; and
* in the County of Laprairie: the parish municipalities of Saint-Constant and Sainte-Catherine-d&#x27;Alexandrie-de-Laprairie; and the Indian Reserve of Caughnawaga No. 14.

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of:
* the City of Saint-Lambert;
* the Towns of Brossard, Candiac, Greenfield Park, La Prairie and LeMoyne; and
* in the county of Laprairie: the municipality of Notre-Dame.

In 1980, it was renamed La Prairie. In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the towns of Brossard, Candiac, La Prairie et Saint-Lambert.

The riding was abolished in 1996 when it was abolished into Brossard—La Prairie and Saint-Lambert. 

This riding was re-created during the 2012 electoral redistribution from parts of Châteauguay—Saint-Constant and Brossard—La Prairie.

Following the 2022 federal electoral redistribution the riding will be renamed La Prairie—Atateken. It will also gain a small piece of territory north of Autoroute 30 in Saint-Isidore and a small piece of territory near Ch. St-Bernard in Châteauguay from Châteauguay—Lacolle.

==Profile==
The Bloc Québécois is more popular in the central and southern portions of the riding, in areas such as Saint-Constant, Sainte-Catherine, Delson and rural areas, with significant support in La Prairie. The Liberals are the main competitors to the Bloc, having won in 2015. Their support is concentrated in La Prairie and Candiac. The Mohawk reserve of Kahnawake is dominated by the Liberals and NDP, but turnout is generally low.

==Members of Parliament==
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<text>Anita Desai (born Anita Mazumdar, 24 June 1937) is an Indian novelist and Emerita John E. Burchard Professor of Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She has been shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times. She received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1978 for her novel &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot;, from the Sahitya Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy of Literature. She won the Guardian Prize for &quot;The Village by the Sea&quot; (1983). Her other works include &quot;The Peacock&quot;, &quot;Voices in the City&quot;, &quot;Fire on the Mountain&quot; and an anthology of short stories, &quot;Games at Twilight&quot;. She is on the advisory board of the Lalit Kala Akademi and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, London. Since 2020 she has been a Companion of Literature.

==Early life==
Desai was born in 1937 in Mussoorie, India, to a German immigrant mother, Toni Nime, and a Bengali businessman, D. N. Mazumdar. Her father met her mother while he was an engineering student in pre-war Berlin. They married during a period when it was still unusual for an Indian man to marry a European woman. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to New Delhi, where Desai was raised with her two older sisters and brother.

She grew up speaking Hindi with her neighbours, and German only at home. She also spoke Bengali, Urdu and English. She first learned to read and write in English at school at the age of seven. As a result, English became her &quot;literary language&quot;. She published her first story at the age of nine.

She attended Queen Mary&#x27;s Higher Secondary School in Delhi and received her B.A. in English literature in 1957 from the Miranda House at the University of Delhi. The following year she married Ashvin Desai, later the director of a computer software company and author of the book &quot;Between Eternities: Ideas on Life and The Cosmos&quot;.

They had four children, including Booker Prize-winning novelist Kiran Desai. Her children were taken to Thul (near Alibagh) for weekends, where Desai set her novel &quot;The Village by the Sea&quot;. For that work she won the 1983 Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers.

==Career== 
Desai published her first novel, &quot;Cry The Peacock&quot;, in 1963. In 1958 she collaborated with P. Lal and founded the publishing firm Writers Workshop. She considers &quot;Clear Light of Day&quot; (1980) her most autobiographical work as it is set during her coming of age and also in the same neighborhood in which she grew up.

In 1984, she published &quot;In Custody&quot; – about an Urdu poet in his declining days – which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In 1993, she became a creative writing teacher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The 1999 Booker Prize finalist novel &quot;Fasting, Feasting&quot; increased her popularity. Her novel &quot;The Zigzag Way&quot;, set in 20th-century Mexico, appeared in 2004 and her latest collection of short stories, &quot;The Artist of Disappearance&quot;, was published in 2011.

==Teaching and academic awards==

Desai has taught at Mount Holyoke College, Baruch College, and Smith College. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and Honorary Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge to which she dedicated &quot;Baumgartner&#x27;s Bombay&quot;.

==Film==
In 1993, a film adaptation of her novel &quot;In Custody&quot; was made by Merchant Ivory Productions, directed by Ismail Merchant and screenplay by Shahrukh Husain. It won the 1994 President of India Gold Medal for Best Picture and starred Shashi Kapoor, Shabana Azmi and Om Puri.

<text>Kemsing is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks district of Kent, England. The parish lies on the scarp face of the North Downs, 20 miles south east of Central London and north east of Sevenoaks. Also in the parish there are the hamlets of Heaverham, to the east and Noah&#x27;s Ark to the south. The population of the civil parish in 2001 was 4,014 persons, increasing to a population of 4,218 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
Kemsing was the birthplace of Saint Edith of Wilton, a daughter of the Anglo-Saxon King Edgar I between 961 and 964. The well at the centre of the village is dedicated to her, a plaque on the wall recording the local legend that her saintly presence has given the water healing properties. The parish church, Saxon in origin, is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, despite St Edith having a strong connection here. Another local legend states that the knights who murdered Archbishop Thomas Becket rode through Kemsing on their way to seek him out at Canterbury. Following his canonisation Kemsing became a stop-off place on the Pilgrims&#x27; Way, along which pilgrims travelled to visit the saint&#x27;s shrine at Canterbury Cathedral. 

The lordship of Kemsing had a long royal and noble association: it was held by King Henry II who passed it to Baldwin of Béthune, the Earl of Albemarle. It was acquired by the Earl of Pembroke by his marriage to Lady Alice, Baldwin&#x27;s daughter. The manor passed later to the de Grandison and Fynes families, becoming part of the estates of Baron Say and Sele. In the reign of Edward IV, Kemsing was sold to Sir Geoffry Boleyn, father of the future queen Anne Boleyn, and later reverted to the crown. Briefly in possession of Anne of Cleves, it was then granted by Elizabeth I to Sir Henry Carey and eventually acquired by the Duke of Dorset.

The historic village centre area around the well includes the war memorial of 1921 (Grade II listed by the architect Godfrey Pinkerton), a cluster of picturesque cottages and St. Edith&#x27;s Hall of 1911 (Grade II listed by the architect Godfrey Pinkerton), the front of which is adorned with a statue of the saint and a clock which chimes the hours and bears the inscription:
 
The Women&#x27;s Institute organisation opened its first institute in Kent in Kemsing in December 1915. During the first world war St Edith Hall was used as a hospital and staffed by the Kent Voluntary Aid Detachment. Wounded soldiers from the western front were returned to England and the hall at Kemsing was one of many facilities in the south east of England used during the war.

==Church of St Mary the Virgin==
The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin likely dates back to Saxon times. The first time that Kemsing is mentioned is in a Canterbury diocese document of 822. 
The south wall of the nave was dated by an archaeological survey to late Saxon. 
A tall lancet window in the South Wall may be the earliest in the church. It contains the Madonna roundel (1220), an early piece of glasswork. 

The altar frontals change with the church seasons. The oldest are by the Sisters of Bethany (1888). Two were by Comper. The reredos was designed by Comper and portrays the Annunciation, Nativity, Crucifixion, Burial and Resurrection.
==Local infrastructure==
The main roads in the village are High Street, St Edith&#x27;s Road, West End, Dynes Road and Childsbridge Lane. Along West End can be found a motor repairs garage, a &#x27;Londis&#x27; convenience store that is also an Amazon collection point, and a chemist, In the High Street is a veterinary surgery and St. Edith&#x27;s Social Club. In St Edith&#x27;s Road there is a tearoom. At the end of Dynes Road there is a newsagent, a &#x27;premier&#x27; convenience store, a hairdressers, three takeaway restaurants including Chinese, Indian and fish and chips, which are all collectively known as &quot;Dynes Parade&quot;.

High Street was the location of two public houses, &quot;The Bell&quot; and &quot;The Wheatsheaf&quot;, sited directly opposite each other. On 3 June 2011 &quot;The Wheatsheaf&quot; suffered a serious fire, leaving &quot;The Bell&quot; as the only public house in the village. &quot;The Wheatsheaf&quot; was demolished in October 2012 to make way for three private dwellings.

Further to the east at Heaverham is the &quot;Chequers&quot;.

One mile (2 km) south-east of the village lies Kemsing railway station. The M26 motorway passes through the parish. Between the motorway and the station lies the area of Kemsing known as Noah&#x27;s Ark.

Kemsing is a key stopping-off point on the North Downs Way which runs north of the village along the ridge of the Downs.

==Local environment==
The village lies in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Kemsing Down Reserve, managed by Kemsing Parish Council and Sevenoaks District Council, lies above Pilgrims Way on the North Downs. It is reached from Childsbridge Lane, and is an area of chalk grassland.

==Sports facilities==
To the east of the village is the large open space known as &quot;The Common Field&quot;, used for cricket and football, and the Sir Mark Collet Sports Pavilion, with tennis and squash courts.

The cricket club has been in existence probably since the early 20th century, though no records can be found to establish a firm date. Matches were played in the cricketing field, close to the current site before World War I. The Common Field was given to the parish in October 1923 by Sir Mark Collet, with football and cricket being played there after that. The cricketers used other parts of the village between 1945 and the late 1950s, but the new (current) pavilion was built in 1987, with a new square also being laid, which has been used since that time. There is also a boxing club that operates and participates in local boxing events.

==Crime prevention==
Kemsing has its own police community support officer and officers as well as being covered by regular police patrols. Neighbourhood officers hold frequent consultations with residents and Kent police. Crime in the Kemsing fell by 31 percent in the period 2010-2011.

== Well dressing ==

In 2011, well dressing was introduced to the village and the 2014 well dressing (below right) commemorates World War I.

<text>Yvert et Tellier is a postage stamp dealer and a philatelic publishing company founded in 1895 in the northern French city of Amiens, where the head office is still located. The logo is a circle divided into a snowflake and a smiling sun. It is a pun on the name of the company: &quot;hiver, été liés&quot; (&quot;winter, summer together&quot;) sounds a lot like the French pronunciation of &quot;Yvert et Tellier&quot;.

The family company was founded by Eugène Yvert in 1831 as a printing works for a legitimist newspaper. The switch to philately was decided 1895 by Eugène&#x27;s grandson Louis Yvert and his chief printer Théodule Tellier. Nowadays the company is still run by the Yvert family.

==Products==
Yvert et Tellier&#x27;s major product is a stamp catalog which is a reference for stamps and countries that are most collected by French philatelists: France, Andorra, Monaco, and the former French colonies and their philatelic history as independent states. In France, it is one of the most important philatelic publishing companies, along with Cérès and Dallay.

Continuing the old association between Louis Yvert and Théodore Champion, the &quot;Ancienne Maison Théodore Champion&quot; edits monthly and yearly a colour catalog of newly issued stamps from all over the world. Usually, Yvert catalogs for non-European countries were printed in black and white, but in 2008 they started with full color prints.

It is one of the international references as well, with Michel, Scott and Stanley Gibbons. The Yvert catalogs list stamps issued by all countries in the world, but for non-European countries, the volumes are organized in alphabetic order whereas the German company Michel uses a geographical classification.

==History==

=== Genesis and management successions ===
During the 1890s in Amiens, the Yvert family&#x27;s printing works is the property of Louis Yvert, grandson of the founder, and his chief printer Théodule Tellier; Tellier kept the company running after the premature death of Louis&#x27; father. Louis did not like being in charge of the legimist paper founded by his father, &quot;L&#x27;Écho de la Somme&quot;. He discovered stamp collecting thanks to Tellier, a philatelist, who had already added a small philatelic newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Écho de la timbrologie&quot;, to the papers printed by the company.

In 1895, Yvert and Tellier started getting involved in philatelic books. In November 1896 they published a worldwide catalog of stamps and a stamp album. The success was immediate because of their logical and permanent numbering, in contrast to most of their contemporaries, who changed the numbers in their catalogues upon discovering forgotten stamps.

In 1900, Yvert et Tellier associated with Paris stamp dealer Théodore Champion, who sold unused stamps from all over the world. He fixed the prices of the stamps sold by the company. After Champion&#x27;s death in 1955, Pierre Yvert and the brothers Ladislas and Alexandre Varga bought Champion&#x27;s company and the new firm continued to fix Yvert et Tellier&#x27;s prices.

In April 1913, Tellier sold his share of the company to Louis Yvert because of the loss of his young grandson. Due to their friendship, Yvert decided that the catalog would continue to be named &quot;Yvert et Tellier&quot;.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Yvert prepared his two sons and his son-in-law to run the firm. Henri ran the printing works, his brother Pierre directed &quot;L&#x27;Écho de la timbrologie&quot;, and Jean Gervais took care of the publishing.

Pierre Yvert&#x27;s and Jean Gervais&#x27; two grandsons have run the company since the 1990s.

=== Recent commercial history ===
Since 2001 the apparition of the Dallay catalog has had a major effect on the French philatelist public by providing larger pictures of stamps and information not found in the Yvert et Tellier catalogs, such as the name of the artiste and/or engraver, first date of issue, use, etc. Yvert has been fighting on two fronts: it has successfully defended the rights to its numbering system, and it distributes a free CD-ROM with its French stamp catalog.

Nevertheless, in March 2005, by urging of the French &quot;Conseil de la concurrence&quot;, Yvert agreed to sell the use of the Yvert stamp numbers to other publishers.

In June 2006 Yvert et Tellier published a new catalog of French stamps, a cheaper pocketbook version containing just pictures and prices, as did Cérès, the second main philatelic publishing company in France.

<text>Walter Gabriel Pichon (April 3, 1906 – February 25, 1967) professionally known as Fats Pichon, was an American jazz pianist, singer, bandleader, and songwriter.

==Biography==
Pichon was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, and began playing piano in his childhood. He also played baritone horn in brass bands in his youth, already a professional musician by 1920.

He first went north about 1922, playing at various venues in New York City and New Jersey before settling in Boston for a few years where he studied at the New England Conservatory of Music. After touring the United States and Mexico with various bands in the mid-1920s, he settled again in his home town of New Orleans for the later part of the decade, leading bands under his own name at dance halls and on river boats on the Mississippi River. On visits back to New York he made some recordings, mostly as a vocalist on novelty numbers, with Luis Russell and other New Orleans groups.

In the 1930s, Fats Pichon led what some considered the best big band in New Orleans; it also made Mississippi Riverboat excursions. Musicians included young Dave Bartholomew. This band never recorded. In the 1940s he began a long gig as the house pianist at &quot;The Old Absinthe House&quot;, a popular venue on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, where he remained until about 1960, with occasional tours of other parts of the U.S., Latin America, and the Caribbean. Pichon moved into the role of Eddie the Waiter, replacing comedian Eddie Green on the NBC weekly radio comedy &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; during the show&#x27;s last season, 1950–1951. After several episodes the waiter&#x27;s name was changed from &#x27;Eddie&#x27; to &#x27;Fats&#x27;.

He died in Chicago in 1967, aged 60.

<text>Châteauguay was a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1917 and from 1979 to 2004.

==History==

It was created by the British North America Act of 1867. In 1914, it was amalgamated with Huntingdon to become Châteauguay—Huntingdon riding.

The riding was recreated in 1976 from portions of La Prairie and Beauharnois—Salaberry ridings. It consisted of:
* the Towns of Châteauguay, Châteauguay-Centre, Delson, Léry, Mercier, Sainte-Catherine, Saint-Constant and Saint-Rémi;
* in the County of Châteauguay: the parish municipalities of Sainte-Clothilde, Sainte-Martine and Saint-Urbain-Premier; the municipality of Saint-Paul-de-Châteauguay;
* in the County of Laprairie: the parish municipality of Saint-Isidore; the municipality of Saint-Mathieu; the Indian Reserve of Caughnawaga No. 14; and
* in the County of Napierville: the parish municipalities of Saint-Michel and Saint-Rémi.

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of:
* the Towns of Châteauguay, Delson, Mercier, Sainte-Catherine, Saint-Constant and Saint-Rémi;
* in the County of Laprairie: the parish municipalities of Saint-Isidore, Saint-Jacques-le-Mineur and Saint-Philippe; the Municipality of Saint-Mathieu; the Indian Reserve of Kahnawake No. 14; and
* in the County of Napierville: the parish municipalities of Saint-Édouard, Saint-Michel and Saint-Patrick-de-Sherrington.

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of:
* the cities of Châteauguay, Delson, Léry, Mercier, Saint-Constant, Saint-Rémi and Sainte-Catherine;
* the County Regional Municipality of Roussillon, including Kahnawake Indian Reserve No. 14 (Caughnawaga), excepting: the cities of Candiac and La Prairie; the Parish Municipality of Saint-Philippe; and
* in the County Regional Municipality of Les Jardins-de-Napierville: the parish municipalities of Saint-Édouard, Saint-Jacques-le-Mineur and Saint-Michel.

It was abolished in 2003 when it was redistributed into Beauharnois—Salaberry, Saint-Jean and Châteauguay—Saint-Constant ridings.

<doc id="1073708" wikidata="Q1017169" url="?curid=1073708" title="Buruli ulcer">
<text>Buruli ulcer () is an infectious disease characterized by the development of painless open wounds. The disease is limited to certain areas of the world, with most cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and Australia. The first sign of infection is a small painless nodule or area of swelling, typically on the arms or legs. The nodule grows larger over days to weeks, eventually forming an open ulcer. Deep ulcers can cause scarring of muscles and tendons, resulting in permanent disability.

Buruli ulcer is caused by skin infection with bacteria called &quot;Mycobacterium ulcerans&quot;. The mechanism by which &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; is transmitted from the environment to humans is not known but may involve the bite of an aquatic insect or the infection of open wounds. Once in the skin, &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; grows and releases the toxin mycolactone, which blocks the normal function of cells, resulting in tissue death and immune suppression at the site of the ulcer.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating Buruli ulcers with a combination of the antibiotics rifampicin and clarithromycin. With antibiotic administration and proper wound care, small ulcers typically heal within six months. Deep ulcers and those on sensitive body sites may require surgery to remove dead tissue or repair scarred muscles or joints. Even with proper treatment, Buruli ulcers can take months to heal. Regular cleaning and dressing of wounds aid healing and prevent secondary infections.
In 2018, WHO received 2,713 reports of Buruli ulcer globally. Although rare, it typically occurs in rural areas near slow-moving or stagnant water. The first written description of the disease is credited to Albert Ruskin Cook in 1897 at Mengo Hospital in Uganda. Fifty years later, the causative bacterium was isolated and identified by a group at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. In 1998, WHO established the Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative to coordinate global efforts to eliminate Buruli ulcer. WHO considers it a neglected tropical disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
The first sign of Buruli ulcer is a painless swollen bump on the arm or leg, often similar in appearance to an insect bite. Sometimes the swollen area instead appears as a patch of firm, raised skin about three centimeters across called a &quot;plaque&quot;; or a more widespread swelling under the skin.

Over a few weeks, the original swollen area expands to form an irregularly shaped patch of raised skin. After about four weeks, the affected skin sloughs off leaving a painless ulcer. Buruli ulcers typically have &quot;undermined edges&quot;, the ulcer being a few centimeters wider underneath the skin than the wound itself.

In some people, the ulcer may heal on its own or remain small but linger unhealed for years. In others, it continues to grow wider and sometimes deeper, with the skin at the margin dying and sloughing off. Large ulcers may extend deep into underlying tissue, causing bone infection and exposing muscle, tendon, and bone to the air. When ulcers extend into muscles and tendons, parts of these tissues can be replaced by scar tissue, immobilizing the body part and resulting in permanent disability. Exposed ulcers can be infected by other bacteria, causing the wound to become red, painful, and foul smelling. Symptoms are typically limited to those caused by the wound; the disease rarely affects other parts of the body.

Buruli ulcers can appear anywhere on the body but are typically on the limbs. Ulcers are most common on the lower limbs (roughly 62% of ulcers globally) and upper limbs (24%), but can also be found on the trunk (9%), head or neck (3%), or genitals (less than 1%).

The World Health Organization classifies Buruli ulcer into three categories depending on the severity of its symptoms. Category I describes a single small ulcer that is less than . Category II describes a larger ulcer, up to , as well as plaques and broader swollen areas that have not yet opened into ulcers. Category III is for an ulcer larger than 15 centimeters, multiple ulcers, or ulcers that have spread to include particularly sensitive sites such as the eyes, bones, joints, or genitals.

==Cause==
Buruli ulcer is caused by infection of the skin with the bacterium &quot;Mycobacterium ulcerans&quot;. &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; is a mycobacterium, closely related to &quot;Mycobacterium marinum&quot; which infects aquatic animals and, rarely, humans. It is more distantly related to other slow-growing mycobacteria that infect humans, such as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, which causes tuberculosis, and &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;, which causes leprosy. Buruli ulcer typically occurs near slow-moving or stagnant bodies of water, where &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; is found in aquatic insects, mollusks, fish, and the water itself. How &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; is transmitted to humans remains unclear, but somehow bacteria enter the skin and begin to grow. Ulceration is primarily caused by the bacterial toxin mycolactone. As the bacteria grow, they release mycolactone into the surrounding tissue. Mycolactone diffuses into host cells and blocks the action of Sec61, the molecular channel that serves as a gateway to the endoplasmic reticulum. When Sec61 is blocked, proteins that would normally enter the endoplasmic reticulum are mistargeted to the cytosol, causing a pathological stress response that leads to cell death by apoptosis. This results in tissue death at the site of infection, causing the open ulcer characteristic of the disease. At the same time, Sec61 inhibition prevents cells from signaling to activate the immune system, leaving ulcers largely free of immune cells. Immune cells that do reach the ulcer are killed by mycolactone, and tissue examinations of the ulcer show a core of growing bacteria surrounded by debris from dead and dying neutrophils (the most common immune cell).

===Transmission===

It was not known how &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; was introduced to humans. although research in Australia indicates possums as a vector along with mosquitoes to be the cause. Buruli ulcer does not spread from one person to another. In areas endemic for Buruli ulcer, disease occurs near stagnant bodies of water, leading to the long-standing hypothesis that &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; is somehow transmitted to humans from aquatic environments. &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; is widespread in these environments, where it can survive as free-living or in association with other aquatic organisms. Live &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; has been isolated from aquatic insects, mosses, and animal feces, and its DNA has been found in water, soil, mats of bacteria and algae, fish, crayfish, aquatic insects, and other animals that live in or near water. A role for biting insects in transmission has been investigated, with particular focus on mosquitoes, giant water bugs, and Naucoridae. &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; is occasionally found in these insects, and they can sometimes transmit the bacteria in laboratory settings. Whether these insects are regularly involved in transmission remains unclear. Pre-existing wounds have been implicated in disease transmission, and people who immediately wash and bandage open wounds are less likely to acquire Buruli ulcer. Wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts is associated with a lower risk of Buruli ulcer, possibly by preventing insect bites or protecting wounds.

===Genetic susceptibility===
While Buruli ulcer is not contagious, susceptibility sometimes runs in families, suggesting genetics could play a role in who develops the disease. Severe Buruli ulcer in a Beninese family was attributed to a loss of 37 kilobases of chromosome 8 in a region that included a long non-coding RNA and was near the genes for beta-defensins, which are antimicrobial peptides involved in immunity and wound healing. Broader studies have focused on genes involved in susceptibility to other mycobacterial infections, finding susceptibility to Buruli ulcer may be linked to variants in six immunity-related genes: &quot;SLC11A1&quot;, &quot;PRKN&quot;, &quot;NOD2&quot;, &quot;ATG16L1&quot;, &quot;iNOS&quot;, and &quot;IFNG&quot;, as well as in two long non-coding RNAs. A genome-wide association study linked resistance to Buruli ulcer to a variant of &quot;ATG16L1&quot; associated with susceptibility to Crohn&#x27;s disease.

==Diagnosis==

As Buruli ulcer most commonly occurs in low-resource settings, treatment is often initiated by a clinician based on signs and symptoms alone. Where available, diagnosis may then be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; DNA or microscopy to detect mycobacteria. The gold standard test is real-time PCR to detect a DNA sequence termed IS&quot;2404&quot; that is unique to &quot;M. ulcerans&quot;. This method detects &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; in 54–84% of infected people, and is highly specific to &quot;M. ulcerans&quot;. In wealthier healthcare settings, diagnosis is routinely based on PCR results. In low-resource settings, PCR is often unavailable, or can only be performed later at a centralized diagnostic laboratory. For microscopy, fluid is typically taken from the ulcer&#x27;s edge by fine-needle aspiration or by swabbing the edge of the ulcer. The fluid is then stained with the Ziehl–Neelsen stain which makes mycobacteria visible. In practice microscopy detects &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; in just 30–40% of infected people, making it a relatively insensitive diagnostic test. For many bacterial infections, the gold standard for diagnosis is isolating and growing the infective organism in laboratory media. &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; can be grown in laboratory media, but its extremely slow growth rate prevents this from being used diagnostically; even under optimal growth conditions, the bacteria must grow for 9 to 12 weeks before they can be easily detected and identified. Another method of diagnosis is to take a tissue sample from the ulcer and examine it under histological stains. This requires more invasive sampling and review by a trained pathologist and is rarely used in places where Buruli ulcer is endemic.

Other ulcerative diseases can appear similar to Buruli ulcer at its various stages. The nodule that appears early in the disease can resemble a bug bite, sebaceous cyst, lipoma, onchocerciasis, other mycobacterial skin infections, or an enlarged lymph node. Skin ulcers can resemble those caused by leishmaniasis, yaws, squamous cell carcinoma, &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; infection, and tissue death due to poor circulation. More diffuse lesions can resemble cellulitis and fungal infections of the skin.

==Treatment==

Buruli ulcer is treated through a combination of antibiotics to kill the bacteria, and wound care or surgery to support the healing of the ulcer. The most widely used antibiotic regimen is once daily oral rifampicin plus twice-daily oral clarithromycin, recommended by the World Health Organization. Several other antibiotics are sometimes used in combination with rifampicin, namely ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ethambutol, amikacin, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. A 2018 Cochrane review suggested that the many antibiotic combinations being used are effective treatments, but there is insufficient evidence to determine if any combination is the most effective. Approximately 1 in 5 people with Buruli ulcer experience a temporary worsening of symptoms 3 to 12 weeks after they begin taking antibiotics. This syndrome, called a paradoxical reaction, is more common in those with larger ulcers and ulcers on the trunk, and occurs more frequently in adults than in children. The paradoxical reaction in Buruli ulcer is thought to be due to the immune system responding to the wound as bacteria die and the immune-suppressing mycolactone dissipates.

Small or medium-sized ulcers (WHO categories I and II) typically heal within six months of antibiotic treatment, whereas larger ulcers can take over two years to fully heal. Given the long healing times, wound care is a major part of treating Buruli ulcer. The World Health Organization recommends standard wound care practices: covering the ulcer to keep it moist and protected from further damage; regularly changing wound dressings to keep the ulcer clean, removing excess fluid, and helping prevent infection. Treatment sometimes includes surgery to speed healing by removing necrotic ulcer tissue, grafting healthy skin over the wound, or removing scar tissue that can deform muscles and joints. Specialized wound dressings developed for non-infectious causes of ulcers are occasionally used for treating Buruli ulcer but can be prohibitively expensive in low-resource settings.

==Prevention==
Buruli ulcers can be prevented by avoiding contact with aquatic environments in endemic areas, although this may not be possible for people living in these areas. The risk of acquiring it can be reduced by wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and cleaning and covering any wounds as soon as they are noticed. There is no specific vaccine for preventing Buruli ulcer. The BCG vaccine typically given to children to protect against tuberculosis offers temporary partial protection from Buruli ulcer.

==Epidemiology==
Buruli ulcer is relatively rare, with 2,713 cases reported to the World Health Organization in 2018. Most countries do not report data on Buruli ulcer to the World Health Organization, and the extent of its spread is unknown. In many endemic countries, health systems likely do not record each case due to insufficient reach and resources, and so the reported numbers probably underestimate the true prevalence of the disease.

Buruli ulcer is concentrated in West Africa and coastal Australia, with occasional cases in Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Americas. In West Africa, the disease is predominantly reported from remote, rural communities in Benin, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Cameroon, and Ghana. Other countries in the region also have Buruli ulcer to some degree; a 2019 systematic review of prevalence studies found a clear consensus that it is present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Liberia, Nigeria, Togo, and South Sudan, as well as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;very strong&quot; evidence of the disease in the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic, Guinea, and Uganda. Buruli ulcer is regularly reported from Australia, where it occurs in coastal clusters—two in Queensland (near Rockhampton and north of Cairns) and two in Victoria (near Bairnsdale and Melbourne). It is more rarely reported from Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Americas. Japan reports a few locally acquired cases per year scattered across the main island, Honshu. Papua New Guinea sporadically reports cases to the World Health Organization, typically less than a dozen per year. In the Americas, most Buruli ulcer is reported from French Guiana, with few cases described in surrounding countries. A 2019 review found &quot;strong&quot; evidence for the presence of Buruli ulcer in French Guiana and Peru, and &quot;moderate&quot; evidence in Brazil, Mexico and Suriname.

Within affected countries, Buruli ulcer tends to occur in rural areas near slow-moving or stagnant water. In particular, the disease tends to appear near water that has experienced human intervention, such as the building of dams or irrigation systems, flooding, or deforestation. Within endemic communities, few characteristics predict who will acquire Buruli ulcer. Males and females are equally likely to be infected. Ulcers can appear in people of all ages, although infections are most common among children between 5 and 15 years in West Africa, and adults over 40 in Australia and Japan.

==Other animals==

&quot;M. ulcerans&quot; infection can cause Buruli ulcer-like lesions in some non-human animals. Natural non-human infections have only been described in coastal Victoria, near Melbourne. There, &quot;M. ulcerans&quot;-positive lesions have been described in koalas, common ringtail possums, and common brushtail possums, with lesions typically on the face, limbs, and tail. Ulcers have also been reported on domesticated animals, namely dogs, horses, alpacas, and a cat. In laboratories several species of animals have been infected with &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; in an attempt to model the course of Buruli ulcer. Injection of &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; can cause ulcers in several rodents (mice, guinea pigs, greater cane rats and common African rats), larger mammals (nine-banded armadillos, common brushtail possums, pigs, and Cynomolgus monkeys), and anole lizards.
==Society and culture==
In endemic areas, particularly rural communities in Africa, people may be aware of Buruli ulcer&#x27;s association with the environment, yet simultaneously associate it with witchcraft or other supernatural causes. This dual understanding of disease—combined with poor access to conventional medicine—drives many to seek traditional healers for primary care. Traditional healers often treat Buruli ulcers with two simultaneous approaches: herbs and sometimes burning or bleeding to treat the physical wound; and confession, ritual purification, and prohibitions on food, interpersonal contact, or sex to treat the spiritual component of the disease. Those with Buruli ulcer report feeling shame and experiencing social stigma that could affect their relationships, school attendance, and marriage prospects.

Buruli ulcer is known by several other names in different parts of the world. In southeastern Australia, it was originally called &quot;Searls&#x27; ulcer&quot; after the physician who saw the first Australian patients at the Bairnsdale Clinic and sent material to Peter MacCallum&#x27;s group for further examination. The disease later became more generally known as &quot;Bairnsdale ulcer&quot; after the district where it was described. In northeastern Australia, north of Cairns, the disease is called &quot;Daintree ulcer&quot; or &quot;Mossman ulcer&quot; after the nearby Daintree River and the town of Mossman. In Papua New Guinea, the disease is called &quot;Kumusi ulcer&quot; after the Kumusi River along which villages with Buruli ulcer were originally described.

==History==

The first written description of Buruli ulcer is credited to a British missionary doctor, Albert R. Cook. In 1897, at Mengo Hospital in Uganda, Cook noted several patients with slow-healing ulcers. The cause of these slow-healing ulcers was identified 50 years later in 1948, when Peter MacCallum, Jean Tolhurst, Glen Buckle, and at The Alfred Hospital&#x27;s Baker Institute described a series of cases from Bairnsdale, Victoria, isolated the causative mycobacterium, and showed it could cause ulcers in laboratory rats. Over the following decades, more cases were described in Africa. A particularly high prevalence in Uganda&#x27;s Buruli County led to the disease becoming more widely known as &quot;Buruli ulcer&quot;.

In 1998, the World Health Organization started the Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative to coordinate global efforts to control the disease. This was followed in 2004 by World Health Organization Resolution WHA57.1 calling upon member countries to support the Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative and increase research on Buruli ulcer diagnostics and treatment. Interest in Buruli ulcer has been encouraged by its branding as a &quot;neglected tropical disease&quot;, first in a 2005 &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot; article, and later by both the World Health Organization and &quot;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&quot;.

From the time the disease was described, Buruli ulcer was treated with surgery to remove all affected tissue, followed by prolonged wound care. This treatment regimen was expensive, sometimes disfiguring, and often ineffective, with ulcers recurring in up to a third of cases. Treatment dramatically improved in 2004, when the World Health Organization recommended an eight-week course of daily oral rifampicin and injected streptomycin. The introduction of antibiotics reduced the rate of ulcer recurrence to fewer than 2% of cases. However, streptomycin can be toxic to the ears and kidneys, and administering daily injections is challenging in low-resource settings. In 2017, the World Health Organization updated its recommendation to replace streptomycin with the oral antibiotic clarithromycin.

==Research==

Buruli ulcer has been the subject of scientific research since the description of &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; in 1948, and the demonstration that the bacteria could cause ulcers in laboratory animals. While several animals are susceptible to &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; ulcers, mice (particularly BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice) are most commonly used to model Buruli ulcer in modern laboratories. Since &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; can only grow in relatively cool temperatures, mice are typically infected in furless parts of the body: the ear, tail, or footpad. After injection into the mouse, bacteria double every three to four days, and the first signs of skin disease appear after three to four weeks. This mouse model of Buruli ulcer has primarily been used to test antibiotics. The antibiotic combinations, dose frequencies, and treatment durations currently in use were first tested in laboratory-infected mice. Some vaccine platforms have been tested in &quot;M. ulcerans&quot;-infected mice, mostly based on the &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot; strain used in the BCG vaccine. The BCG vaccine and versions of the vaccine that also express &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; antigens prolong the survival of mice after &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; infection. As of 2019, no vaccine tested completely protects mice from infection.

&quot;M. ulcerans&quot; can be grown in laboratory media, although its slow growth makes it challenging to study. Bacteria plated on laboratory media can take up to three months to form visible colonies. Strains of &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; used in laboratories are less standardized than the mice they infect; different laboratories use different strains based on convenience and accessibility. Three &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; strains are particularly common, each isolated from an infected person: &quot;Cu001&quot; from Adzopé, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1996; &quot;Mu1615&quot; from Malaysia in the 1960s; and &quot;S1013&quot; from Cameroon in 2010.

<text>The Serpentine Galleries are two contemporary art galleries in Kensington Gardens, Westminster, Greater London. Recently rebranded to just Serpentine, the organisation is split across Serpentine South, previously known as the Serpentine Gallery, and Serpentine North, previously known as the Sackler Gallery. The gallery spaces are within five minutes&#x27; walk of each other, linked by the bridge over the Serpentine Lake from which the galleries get their names. Their exhibitions, architecture, education and public programmes attract up to 1.2 million visitors a year. Admission to both galleries is free. The CEO is Bettina Korek, and the artistic director Hans Ulrich Obrist.

==Serpentine South==
Serpentine South, previously known as the Serpentine Gallery, was established in 1970 and is housed in a Grade II listed former tea pavilion built in 1933–34 by the architect James Grey West. Notable artists whose works have been exhibited there include Man Ray, Henry Moore, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, Paula Rego, Sondra Perry, Bridget Riley, Allan McCollum, Anish Kapoor, Christian Boltanski, Philippe Parreno, Richard Prince, Wolfgang Tillmans, Gerhard Richter, Gustav Metzger, Damien Hirst, Maria Lassnig, Adrian Berg, Jeff Koons and Marina Abramović. On the ground at the gallery&#x27;s entrance is a permanent work made by Ian Hamilton Finlay in collaboration with Peter Coates, and dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales, the gallery&#x27;s former patron.

==Serpentine North==
In 2013, Serpentine North was opened to the public named as the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, a name changed to Serpentine North in 2021. This gave new life to The Magazine, a Grade II* listed former gunpowder store built in 1805, with the addition of an extension designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. Located five minutes&#x27; walk from Serpentine South across the Serpentine Bridge, it comprises of gallery space, restaurant, shop and social space. The Magazine Restaurant adjoins the gallery space.

==Pavilions==
Every year since 2000, Serpentine has commissioned a temporary summer pavilion by a leading architect. The series presents the work of an international architect or design team who has not completed a building in England at the time of the Gallery&#x27;s invitation. Each Pavilion is completed within six months and is situated on the Serpentine South&#x27;s lawn for three months for the public to explore.

<text>Makuria (Old Nubian: , &quot;Dotawo&quot;; ; ) was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is today northern Sudan and southern Egypt. Its capital was Dongola (Old Nubian: &quot;&quot;) in the fertile Dongola Reach, and the kingdom is sometimes known by the name of its capital.

Coming into being after the collapse of the Kingdom of Kush in the 4th century, it originally covered the Nile Valley from the 3rd cataract to somewhere south of Abu Hamed at Mograt Island. The capital of Dongola was founded around 500 and soon after, in the mid-6th century, Makuria converted to Christianity. Probably in the early 7th century Makuria annexed its northern neighbour Nobatia, now sharing a border with Byzantine Egypt.

In 651 an Arab army invaded, but it was repulsed and a treaty known as the &quot;Baqt&quot; was signed to prevent further Arab invasions in exchange for 360 slaves each year. This treaty lasted until the 13th century. The period from the 9th to 11th century saw the peak of Makuria&#x27;s cultural development: a brisk construction activity resulted in the construction of buildings like the Throne Hall, the great cruciform church (both in Dongola) or the Banganarti monastery, arts like wall paintings and finely crafted and decorated pottery flourished and Nubian grew to become the prevalent written language. Other written languages were Coptic, Greek and Arabic. Makuria also maintained close dynastic ties with the kingdom of Alodia to the south and exerted some influence in Upper Egypt and northern Kordofan.

Increased aggression from Mamluk Egypt, internal discord, Bedouin incursions and possibly the plague and the shift of trade routes led to the state&#x27;s decline in the 13th and 14th century. In the 1310s and 1320s it was briefly ruled by Muslim kings. Due to a civil war in 1365, the kingdom was reduced to a rump state that lost much of its southern territories, including Dongola. The last recorded king, probably residing in Gebel Adda, lived in the late 15th century. Makuria had finally disappeared by the 1560s, when the Ottomans occupied Lower Nubia. The former Makurian territories south of the 3rd cataract, including Dongola, had been annexed by the Islamic Funj Sultanate by the early 16th century.

==Sources==
Makuria is much better known than its neighbor Alodia to the south, but there are still many gaps in our knowledge. The most important source for the history of the area is various Arab travelers and historians who passed through Nubia during this period. These accounts are often problematic as many of the Arab writers were biased against their Christian neighbors. These works generally focus on only the military conflicts between Egypt and Nubia. One exception is Ibn Selim el-Aswani, an Egyptian diplomat who traveled to Dongola when Makuria was at the height of its power in the 10th century and left a detailed account.
The Nubians were a literate society, and a fair body of writing survives from the period. These documents were written in the Old Nubian language in an uncial variety of the Greek alphabet extended with some Coptic symbols and some symbols unique to Nubian. Written in a language that is closely related to the modern Nobiin tongue, these documents have long been deciphered. However, the vast majority of them are works dealing with religion or legal records that are of little use to historians. The largest known collection, found at Qasr Ibrim, does contain some valuable governmental records.

The construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1964 threatened to flood what had once been the northern half of Makuria. In 1960, UNESCO launched a massive effort to do as much archaeological work as possible before the flooding occurred. Thousands of experts were brought from around the world over the next few years. Some of the more important Makurian sites looked at were the city of Faras and its cathedral, excavated by a team from Poland; the British work at Qasr Ibrim; and the University of Ghana&#x27;s work at the town of Debeira West, which gave important information on daily life in medieval Nubia. All of these sites are in what was Nobatia; the only major archaeological site in Makuria itself is the partial exploration of the capital at Old Dongola.

==History==
===Early period (5th–8th century)===
By the early 4th century, if not before, the Kingdom of Kush with its capital Meroe was collapsing. The region which would later constitute Makuria, i.e. the Nile Valley between the third Nile cataract and the great Nile bend of the fourth/fifth cataract, has been proposed to have seceded from Kush already in the 3rd century. Here, a homogenous and relatively isolated culture dubbed as &quot;pre-Makuria&quot; developed. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the region of Napata, located near the fourth cataract and formerly being one of the most important political and sacred places of Kush, served as the center for a new regional elite buried in large tumuli like those at el Zuma or Tanqasi. There was a significant population growth accompanied by social transformations, resulting in the absorption of the Kushites into the Nubians, a people originally from Kordofan that had settled in the Nile Valley in the 4th century AD. Thus, a new Makurian society and state emerged by the 5th century. In the late 5th century one of the first Makurian kings moved the power base of the still-developing kingdom from Napata to further downstream, where the fortress of Dongola, the new seat of the royal court, was founded and which soon developed a vast urban district. Many more fortresses were built along the banks of the Nile, probably not intended to serve a military purpose, but to foster urbanization.

Already at the time of the foundation of Dongola contacts were maintained with the Byzantine Empire. In the 530s, the Byzantines under Emperor Justinian mounted a policy of expansion. The Nubians were part of his plan to win allies against the Sasanian Persians by converting them to Christianity, the Byzantine state religion. The imperial court, however, was divided in two sects, believing in two different natures of Jesus Christ: Justinian belonged to the Chalcedonians, the official denomination of the empire, while his wife Theodora was a Miaphysite, who were the strongest in Egypt. John of Ephesus described how two competing missions were sent to Nubia, with the Miaphysite arriving first in, and converting, the northern kingdom of Nobatia in 543. While the Nobatian king refused Justinian&#x27;s mission to travel further south archaeological records might suggest that Makuria converted still in the first half of the 6th century. The chronicler John of Biclar recorded that in around 568 Makuria had “received the faith of Christ”. In 573 a Makurian delegation arrived in Constantinople, offering ivory and a giraffe and declaring its good relationship with the Byzantines. Unlike Nobatia in the north (with which Makuria seemed to have been in enmity) and Alodia in the south Makuria embraced the Chalcedonian doctrine. The early ecclesiastical architecture at Dongola confirms the close relations maintained with the empire, trade between the two states was flourishing.
In the 7th century, Makuria annexed its northern neighbour Nobatia. While there are several contradicting theories, it seems likely that this occurred soon after the Sasanian occupation of Egypt, presumably during the 620s, but before 642. Before the Sasanian invasion, Nobatia used to have strong ties with Egypt and was thus hit hard by its fall. Perhaps it was also invaded by the Sasanians itself: some local churches from that period show traces of destruction and subsequent rebuilding. Thus weakened, Nobatia fell to Makuria, making Makuria extend as far north as Philae near the first cataract. A new bishopric was founded in Faras in around 630 and two new cathedrals styled after the basilica of Dongola were built in Faras and Qasr Ibrim. It is not known what happened to the royal Nobatian family after the unification, but it is recorded that Nobatia remained a separate entity within the unified kingdom governed by an Eparch.
Between 639 and 641 the Muslim Arabs overran Byzantine Egypt. A Byzantine request for help remained unanswered by the Nubians due to conflicts with the Beja. In 641 or 642 the Arabs sent a first expedition into Makuria. While it is not clear how far south it penetrated, it was eventually defeated. A second invasion led by Abd Allah ibn Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi al-Sarh followed in 651/652, when the attackers pushed as far south as Dongola. Dongola was besieged and bombarded by catapults. While they damaged parts of the town they could not penetrate the walls of the citadel. Muslim sources highlight the skill of the Nubian archers in repelling the invasion. With both sides being unable to decide the battle in their favour, abi Sarh and the Makurian king Qalidurut eventually met and drew up a treaty known as Baqt. Initially it was a ceasefire also containing an annual exchange of goods (Makurian slaves for Egyptian wheat, textiles etc.), an exchange typical for historical North East African states and perhaps being a continuation of terms already existing between the Nubians and Byzantines. Probably in Umayyad times the treaty was expanded by regulating the safety of Nubians in Egypt and Muslims in Makuria. While some modern scholars view the Baqt as a submission of Makuria to the Muslims it is clear that it was not: the exchanged goods were of equal value and Makuria was recognized as an independent state, being one of the few to beat back the Arabs during the early Islamic expansion. The Baqt would remain in force for more than six centuries, although at times interrupted by mutual raids.

The 8th century was a period of consolidation. Under king Merkurios, who lived in the late 7th and early 8th century and whom the Coptic biograph John the Deacon approvingly refers to as “the new Constantine”, the state seems to have been reorganized and Miaphysite Christianity to have become the official creed. He probably also founded the monumental Ghazali monastery (around 5000 m2) in Wadi Abu Dom. Zacharias, Merkurios&#x27; son and successor, renounced his claim to the throne and went into a monastery, but maintained the right to proclaim a successor. Within a few years there were three different kings and several Muslim raids until before 747, the throne was seized by Kyriakos. In that year, John the Deacon claims, the Umayyad governor of Egypt imprisoned the Coptic Patriarch, resulting in a Makurian invasion and siege of Fustat, the Egyptian capital, after which the Patriarch was released. This episode has been referred to as “Christian Egyptian propaganda”, although it is still likely that Upper Egypt was subject to a Makurian campaign, perhaps a raid. Nubian influence in Upper Egypt would remain strong. Three years later, in 750, after the fall of the Umayyad Calipate, the sons of Marwan II, the last Umayyad Caliph, fled to Nubia and asked Kyriakos for asylum, although without success. In around 760 Makuria was probably visited by the Chinese traveller Du Huan.

===Zenith (9th–11th century)===

The kingdom was at its peak between the 9th and 11th centuries. During the reign of king Ioannes in the early 9th century, relations with Egypt were cut and the Baqt ceased to be paid. Upon Ioannes&#x27; death in 835 an Abbasid emissary arrived, demanding the Makurian payment of the missing 14 annual payments and threatening with war if the demands are not met. Thus confronted with a demand for more than 5000 slaves, Zakharias III &quot;Augustus&quot;, the new king, had his son Georgios I crowned king, probably to increase his prestige, and sent him to the caliph in Baghdad to negotiate. His travel drew much attention at the time. The 12th-century Syriac Patriarch Michael described Georgios and his retinue in some detail, writing that Georgios rode a camel, wielded a sceptre and a golden cross in his hands and that a red umbrella was carried over his head. He was accompanied by a bishop, horsemen and slaves, and to his left and right were young men wielding crosses. A few months after Georgios arrived in Baghdad he, described as educated and well-mannered, managed to convince the caliph of remitting the Nubian debts and reducing the Baqt payments to a three-year rhythm. In 836 or early 837 Georgios returned to Nubia. After his return a new church was built in Dongola, the Cruciform Church, which had an approximate height of and came to be the largest building in the entire kingdom. A new palace, the so-called Throne Hall of Dongola, was also built, showing strong Byzantine influences.

In 831 a punitive campaign of the Abbasid caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim defeated the Beja east of Nubia. As a result, they had to submit to the Caliph, thus expanding nominal Muslim authority over much of the Sudanese Eastern Desert. In 834 al-Mu&#x27;tasim ordered that the Egyptian Arab Bedouins, who had been declining as a military force since the rise of the Abbasids, were not to receive any more payments. Discontented and dispossessed, they pushed southwards. The road into Nubia was, however, blocked by Makuria: while there existed communities of Arab settlers in Lower Nubia the great mass of the Arab nomads was forced to settle among the Beja, driven also by the motivation to exploit the local gold mines. In the mid-9th century the Arab adventurer al-Umari hired a private army and settled at a mine near Abu Hamad in eastern Makuria. After a confrontation between both parties, al-Umari occupied Makurian territories along the Nile. King Georgios I sent an elite force commanded by his son in law, Nyuti, but he failed to defeat the Arabs and rebelled against the crown himself. King Georgios then sent his oldest son, presumably the later Georgios II, but he was abandoned by his army and was forced to flee to Alodia. The Makurian king then sent another son, Zacharias, who worked together with al-Umari to kill Nyuti before eventually defeating al-Umari himself and pushing him into the desert. Afterward, al-Umari attempted to establish himself in Lower Nubia, but was soon pushed out again before finally being murdered during the reign of the Tulunid Sultan Ahmad ibn Tulun (868–884).
During the rule of the autonomous Ikhshidid dynasty in Egypt, relations between Makuria and Egypt worsened: in 951 a Makurian army marched against Egypt&#x27;s Kharga Oasis, killing and enslaving many people. Five years later the Makurians attacked Aswan, but were subsequently chased as far south as Qasr Ibrim. A new Makurian attack on Aswan followed immediately, which was answered by another Egyptian retaliation, this time capturing Qasr Ibrim. This did not put a hold on Makurian aggression and between 962 and 964 they again attacked, this time pushing as far north as Akhmim. Parts of Upper Egypt apparently remained occupied by Makuria for several years. Ikhshidid Egypt eventually fell in 969, when it was conquered by the Shiite Fatimid Caliphate. Immediately afterward the Fatimids sent the emissary Ibn Salim al-Aswani to the Makurian king Georgios III. Georgios accepted the first request of the emissary, the resumption of the Baqt, but declined the second one, the conversion to Islam, after a lengthy discussion with his bishops and learned men, and instead invited the Fatimid governor of Egypt to embrace Christianity. Afterwards, he granted al-Aswani permission to celebrate Eid al-Adha outside of Dongola with drums and trumpets, though not without the discontent of some of his subjects. Relations between Makuria and Fatimid Egypt were to remain peaceful, as the Fatimids needed the Nubians as allies against their Sunni enemies.
The kingdom of Makuria was, at least temporarily, exercising influence over the Nubian-speaking populations of Kordofan, the region between the Nile Valley and Darfur, as is suggested by an account of the 10th century traveller Ibn Hawqal as well as oral traditions. With the southern Nubian kingdom of Alodia, with which Makuria shared its border somewhere between Abu Hamad and the Nile-Atbara confluence, Makuria seemed to have maintained a dynastic union, as according to the accounts of Arab geographers from the 10th century and Nubian sources from the 12th century. Archaeological evidence shows an increased Makurian influence on Alodian art and architecture from the 8th century. Meanwhile, evidence for contact with Christian Ethiopia is surprisingly scarce. An exceptional case was the mediation of Georgios III between Patriarch Philotheos and some Ethiopian monarch, perhaps the late Aksumite emperor Anbessa Wudem or his successor Dil Ne&#x27;ad. Ethiopian monks travelled through Nubia to reach Jerusalem, a graffito from the church of Sonqi Tino testifies its visit by an Ethiopian abuna. Such travellers also transmitted knowledge of Nubian architecture, which influenced several medieval Ethiopian churches.
During the second half of the 11th century, Makuria saw great cultural and religious reforms, referred to as &quot;Nubization&quot;. The main initiator has been suggested to have been Georgios, the archbishop of Dongola and hence the head of the Makurian church. He seems to have popularized the Nubian language as written language to counter the growing influence of Arabic in the Coptic Church and introduced the cult of dead rulers and bishops as well as indigenous Nubian saints. A new, unique church was built in Banganarti, probably becoming one of the most important ones in the entire kingdom. In the same period Makuria also began to adopt a new royal dress and regalia and perhaps also Nubian terminology in administration and titles, all suggested to have initially come from Alodia in the south.

===Decline (12th century – 1365)===

In 1171 Saladin overthrew the Fatimid dynasty, which signaled new hostilities between Egypt and Nubia. The following year, a Makurian army pillaged Aswan and advanced even further north. It is not clear if this campaign was intended to aid the Fatimids or was merely a raid exploiting the unstable situation in Egypt, although the latter seems more likely, as the Makurians apparently soon withdrew. To deal with the Nubians, Saladin sent his brother Turan-Shah. The latter conquered Qasr Ibrim in January 1173, reportedly sacking it, taking many prisoners, pillaging the church and converting it into a mosque. Afterward, he sent an emissary to the Makurian king, Moses Georgios, intending to answer a previously requested peace treaty with a pair of arrows. Probably ruling over both Makuria and Alodia, Moses Georgios was a man confident in his ability to resist the Egyptians, stamping with hot iron a cross on the emissary&#x27;s hand. Turan Shah withdrew from Nubia but left a detachment of Kurdish troops in Qasr Ibrim, which would raid Lower Nubia for the next two years. Archaeological evidence links them with the destruction of the cathedral of Faras, Abdallah Nirqi and Debeira West. In 1175 a Nubian army finally arrived to confront the invaders at Adindan. Before battle, however, the Kurdish commander drowned while crossing the Nile, resulting in the retreat of Saladin&#x27;s troops out of Nubia. Afterwards there was peace for another 100 years.

There are no records from travelers to Makuria from 1172 to 1268, and the events of this period have long been a mystery, although modern discoveries have shed some light on this era. During this period Makuria seems to have entered a steep decline. The best source on this is Ibn Khaldun, writing in the 14th century, who blamed it on Bedouin invasions similar to what the Mamluks were dealing with. Other factors for the decline of Nubia might have been the change of African trade routes and a severe dry period between 1150 and 1500.


Matters would change with the rise of the Mamluks and Sultan Baybars in 1260. In 1265 a Mamluk army allegedly raided Makuria as far south as Dongola while also expanding southwards along the African Red Sea coast, thus threatening the Nubians. In 1272 king David marched east and attacked the port town of Aidhab, located on an important pilgrimage route to Mecca. The Nubian army destroyed the town, causing “a blow to the very heart of Islam”. A punitive Mamluk expedition was sent in response, but did not pass beyond the second cataract. Three years later the Makurians attacked and destroyed Aswan, but this time Mamluk Sultan Baybars responded with a well-equipped army setting off from Cairo in early 1276, accompanied by a cousin of king David named Mashkouda or Shekanda. The Mamluks defeated the Nubians in three battles at Gebel Adda, Meinarti and finally at the Battle of Dongola. David fled upstream the Nile, eventually entering al-Abwab in the south, which, previously being Alodia&#x27;s northernmost province, had by this period become a kingdom of its own. The king of al-Abwab, however, handed David over to Baybars, who had him executed.
Thanks to the crusades, western Europe grew increasingly aware of the existence of Christian Nubia during the 12th and 13th centuries until in the early 14th century, there were even proposals to ally with the Nubians for another crusade against the Mamluks. Nubian characters also start to be featured in crusader songs, first displayed as Muslims and later, after the 12th century and with increasing knowledge of Nubia, as Christians. Contacts between crusaders and western pilgrims on the one side and Nubians on the other occurred in Jerusalem, where European accounts from the 12th–14th centuries attest the existence of a Nubian community, and also, if not primarily in Egypt, where many Nubians were living and where European merchants were highly active. Perhaps there also existed a Nubian community in crusader-controlled Famagusta, Cyprus. In the mid-14th century pilgrim Niccolò da Poggibonsi claimed that the Nubians had sympathies for the Latins and hence the Mamluk Sultan did not allow Latins to travel to Nubia as he was afraid that they might convince the Nubians to start a war, although in the contemporary &quot;Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms&quot; it was written that Genoese traders were present in Dongola. A text was found in Qasr Ibrim apparently mixing Nubian with Italian as well as a Catalan playing card and in Banganarti there has been noted an inscription written in Provencal dating to the second half of the 13th century/14th century.

Internal difficulties seem to have also hurt the kingdom. King David&#x27;s cousin Shekanda claimed the throne and traveled to Cairo to seek the support of the Mamluks. They agreed and took over Nubia in 1276, and placed Shekanda on the throne. The Christian Shekanda then signed an agreement making Makuria a vassal of Egypt, and a Mamluk garrison was stationed in Dongola. A few years later, Shamamun, another member of the Makurian royal family, led a rebellion against Shekanda to restore Makurian independence. He eventually defeated the Mamluk garrison and took the throne in 1286 after separating from Egypt and betraying the peace deal. He offered the Egyptians an increase in the annual Baqt payments in return for scrapping the obligations to which Shekanda had agreed. The Mamluk armies were occupied elsewhere, and the Sultan of Egypt agreed to this new arrangement.
After a period of peace, King Karanbas defaulted on these payments, and the Mamluks again occupied the kingdom in 1312. This time, a Muslim member of the Makurian dynasty was placed on the throne. Sayf al-Din Abdullah Barshambu began converting the nation to Islam and in 1317 the throne hall of Dongola was turned into a mosque. This was not accepted by other Makurian leaders and the nation fell into civil war and anarchy later that year. Barshambu was eventually killed and succeeded by Kanz ad-Dawla. While ruling, his tribe, the Banu Khanz, acted a puppet dynasty of the Mamluks. King Karanbas tried to wrestle control from Kanz ad-Dwala in 1323 and eventually seized Dongola, but was ousted just one year later. He retreated to Aswan for another chance to seize the throne, but it never came.

The ascension of the Muslim king Abdallah Barshambu and his transformation of the throne hall into a mosque has often been interpreted as the end of Christian Makuria. This conclusion is erroneous, since Christianity evidently remained vital in Nubia. While not much is known about the following decades, it seems that there were both Muslim and Christian kings on the Makurian throne. Both the traveller Ibn Battuta and the Egyptian historian Shihab al-Umari claim that the contemporary Makurian kings were Muslims belonging to the Banu Khanz, while the general population remained Christian. Al-Umari also points out that Makuria was still dependent on the Mamluk Sultan. On the other hand, he also remarks that the Makurian throne was seized in turns by Muslims and Christians. Indeed, an Ethiopian monk who travelled through Nubia in around 1330, Gadla Ewostatewos, states that the Nubian king, who he claims to have met in person, was Christian. In the &quot;Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms&quot;, which relies on an anonymous traveller from the mid-14th century, it is claimed that the &quot;Kingdom of Dongola&quot; was inhabited by Christians and that its royal banner was a cross on white background (see flag). Epigraphical evidence reveals the names of three Makurian kings: and Abdallah Kanz ad-Dawla, both ruling during the 1330s, and , who is dated to the mid 14th century. The attestations of Siti&#x27;s reign, all Nubian in nature, show that he still exercised control/influence over a vast territory from Lower Nubia to Kordofan, suggesting that his kingdom entered the second half of the 14th century centralized, powerful and Christian.

It was also in the mid 14th century, more particularly after 1347, when Nubia would have been devastated by the plague. Archaeology confirms a rapid decline of the Christian Nubian civilization since then. Due to their small population the plague might have cleansed entire landscapes from its Nubian inhabitants.

In 1365, there occurred yet another short, but disastrous civil war. The current king was killed in battle by his rebelling nephew, who had allied himself with the Banu Ja&#x27;d tribe. The brother of the deceased king and his retinue fled to a town called &quot;Daw&quot; in the Arabic sources, most likely identical with Gebel Adda in Lower Nubia. The usurper then killed the nobility of the Banu Ja&#x27;d, probably because he could not trust them anymore, and destroyed and pillaged Dongola, then traveled to Gebel Adda to ask his uncle for forgiveness. Thus Dongola was left to the Banu Ja&#x27;d and Gebel Adda became the new capital.

===Terminal period (1365–late 15th century)===
====The Makurian rump state====
Both the usurper and the rightful heir, and most likely even the king that was killed during the usurpation, were Christian. Now residing in Gebel Adda, the Makurian kings continued their Christian traditions. They ruled over a reduced rump state with a confirmed north–south extension of around 100 km, albeit it might have been larger in reality. Located in a strategically irrelevant periphery, the Mamluks left the kingdom alone. In the sources this kingdom appears as &quot;Dotawo&quot;. Until recently it was commonly assumed that &quot;Dotawo&quot; was, before the Makurian court shifted its seat to Gebel Adda, just a vasal kingdom of Makuria, but it is now accepted that it was merely the Old Nubian self-designation for Makuria.

The last known king is Joel, who is mentioned in a 1463 document and in an inscription from 1484. Perhaps it was under Joel when the kingdom witnessed a last, brief renaissance. After the death or deposition of king Joel the kingdom might have collapsed. The cathedral of Faras came out of use after the 15th century, just as Qasr Ibrim was abandoned by the late 15th century. The palace of Gebel Adda came out of use after the 15th century as well. In 1518, there is one last mention of a Nubian ruler, albeit it is unknown where he resided and if he was Christian or Muslim. However, in 2023 Adam Simmons pointed to the existence in the 1520s of Christian Nubian Queen Gaua. There were no traces of an independent Christian kingdom when the Ottomans occupied Lower Nubia in the 1560s, while the Funj had come into possession of Upper Nubia south of the third cataract.

====Further developments====
=====Political=====
By the early 15th century, there is mention of a king of Dongola, most likely independent from the influence of the Egyptian sultans. Friday prayers held in Dongola failed to mention them as well. These new kings of Dongola were probably confronted with waves of Arab migrations and thus were too weak to conquer the Makurian splinter state of Lower Nubia.

It is possible that some petty kingdoms that continued the Christian Nubian culture developed in the former Makurian territory, for example on Mograt island, north of Abu Hamed. Another small kingdom was the Kingdom of Kokka, probably founded in the 17th century in the no-mans-land between the Ottoman Empire in the north and the Funj in the south. Its organization and rituals bore clear similarities to those of Christian times. Eventually the kings themselves were Christians until the 18th century.

In 1412, the Awlad Kenz took control of Nubia and part of Egypt above the Thebaid.

=====Ethnographic and linguistic=====

The Nubians upstream of Al Dabbah started to assume an Arabic identity and the Arabic language, eventually becoming the Ja&#x27;alin, claimed descendants of Abbas, uncle of Muhammad. The Ja&#x27;alin were already mentioned by David Reubeni, who travelled through Nubia in the early 16th century. They are now divided into several sub-tribes, which are, from Al Dabbah to the conjunction of the Blue and White Nile: Shaiqiya, Rubatab, Manasir, Mirafab and the &quot;Ja&#x27;alin proper&quot;. Among them, Nubian remained a spoken language until the 19th century. North of the Al Dabbah developed three Nubian sub-groups: The Kenzi, who, before the completion of the Aswan Dam, lived between Aswan and Maharraqa, the Mahasi, who settled between Maharraqa and Kerma and the Danagla, the southernmost of the remaining Nile Valley Nubians. Some count the Danagla to the Ja&#x27;alin, since the Danagla also claim to belong to that Arab tribe, but they in fact still speak a Nubian language, Dongolawi. North Kordofan, which was still a part of Makuria as late as the 1330s, also underwent a linguistic Arabization similar to the Nile Valley upstream of Al Dabbah. Historical and linguistic evidence confirms that the locals were predominantly Nubian-speaking until the 19th century, with a language closely related to the Nile-Nubian dialects.

Today, the Nubian language is in the process of being replaced by Arabic. Furthermore, the Nubians have increasingly started to claim to be Arabs descending from Abbas, disregarding their Christian Nubian past.

==Culture==
Christian Nubia was historically considered to be something of a backwater, because their graves were small and lacking the grave goods of previous eras. Modern scholars understand that this was due to cultural differences, and that the Makurians actually had rich and vibrant arts and culture.

=== Languages ===

Four languages were used in Makuria: Nubian, Coptic, Greek and Arabic. Nubian was represented by two dialects, with Nobiin being said to have been spoken in the Nobadia province in the north and Dongolawi in the Makurian heartland, although in the Islamic period Nobiin is also attested to have been employed by the Shaigiya tribe in the southeastern Dongola Reach. 
The royal court employed Nobiin despite being located in Dongolawi-speaking territory. By the eight century Nobiin had been codified based on the Coptic alphabet,{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=187}} but it was not until the 11th century when Nobiin had established itself as language of administrative, economic and religious documents.{{sfn|Ochala|2014|p=36}} The rise of Nobiin overlapped with the decline of the Coptic language in both Makuria and Egypt.{{sfn|Ochala|2014|p=41}} It has been suggested that before the rise of Nobiin as a literary language, Coptic served as official administrative language, but this seems doubtful; Coptic literary remains are virtually absent in the Makurian heartland.{{sfn|Ochala|2014|pp=36–37}} In Nobadia, however, Coptic was fairly widespread,{{sfn|Ochala|2014|p=37}} probably even serving as a lingua franca.{{sfn|Ochala|2014|p=41}} Coptic also served as the language of communication with Egypt and the Coptic Church. Coptic refugees escaping Islamic persecution settled in Makuria, while Nubian priests and bishops would have studied in Egyptian monasteries.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=193–194}} Greek, the third language, was of great prestige and used in religious context, but does not seem to have been actually spoken (similar to Latin in medieval Europe).{{sfn|Ochala|2014|pp=43–44}} 
Lastly, Arabic was used from the 11th and 12th centuries, superseding Coptic as language of commerce and diplomatic correspondences with Egypt. Furthermore, Arab traders and settlers were present in northern Nubia,{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=196}} although the spoken language of the latter appears to have gradually shifted from Arabic to Nubian.{{sfn|Seignobos|2010|p=14}}

===Arts===
==== Wallpaintings ====
As of 2019, around 650 murals distributed over 25 sites have been recorded,{{sfn|Zielinska|Tsakos|2019|p=80}} with more paintings still awaiting publication.{{sfn|Zielinska|Tsakos|2019|p=93}} One of the most important discoveries of the rushed work prior to the flooding of Lower Nubia was the Cathedral of Faras. This large building had been completely filled with sand preserving a series of paintings. Similar, but less well preserved, paintings have been found at several other sites in Makuria, including palaces and private homes, giving an impression of Makurian art. The style and content was heavily influenced by Byzantine art, and also showed influence from Egyptian Coptic art and from Palestine.{{sfn|Godlewski|1991|pp=255–256}} Mainly religious in nature, it depicts many of the standard Christian scenes. Also illustrated are a number of Makurian kings and bishops, with noticeably darker skin than the Biblical figures.
====Manuscript illustrations====
==== Pottery ====
Shinnie refers to Nubian pottery as the &quot;richest indigenous pottery tradition on the African continent.&quot; Scholars divide the pottery into three eras.{{sfn|Shinnie|1965|p=?}} The early period, from 550 to 650 according to Adams, or to 750 according to Shinnie, saw fairly simple pottery similar to that of the late Roman Empire. It also saw much of Nubian pottery imported from Egypt rather than produced domestically. Adams feels this trade ended with the invasion of 652; Shinnie links it to the collapse of Umayyad rule in 750. After this domestic production increased, with a major production facility at Faras. In this middle era, which lasted until around 1100, the pottery was painted with floral and zoomorphic scenes and showed distinct Umayyad and even Sassanian influences.{{sfn|Shinnie|1978|p=570}} The late period during Makuria&#x27;s decline saw domestic production again fall in favour of imports from Egypt. Pottery produced in Makuria became less ornate, but better control of firing temperatures allowed different colours of clay.

===Role of women===

The Christian Nubian society was matrilineal{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=248}} and women enjoyed a high social standing.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=344}} The matrilineal succession gave the queen mother and the sister of the current king as forthcoming queen mother great political relevance.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=248}} This importance is attested by the fact that she constantly appears in legal documents.{{sfn|Ruffini|2012|p=243}} Another female political title was the &quot;asta&quot; (&quot;daughter&quot;), perhaps some type of provincial representative.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=344}}

Women had access to education{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=344}} and there is evidence that, like in Byzantine Egypt, female scribes existed.{{sfn|Ruffini|2012|pp=237–238}} Private land tenure was open to both men and women, meaning that both could own, buy and sell land. Transfers of land from mother to daughter were common.{{sfn|Ruffini|2012|pp=236–237}} They could also be the patrons of churches and wall paintings.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=344–345}} Inscriptions from the cathedral of Faras indicate that around every second wall painting had a female sponsor.{{sfn|Ruffini|2012|p=235}} An inscription from Faras suggests that women could also serve as deacons.{{sfn|Ochała|2023|pp=361–363}}

===Hygiene===
Latrines were a common sight in Nubian domestic buildings.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=170–171}} In Dongola all houses had ceramic toilets.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013a|p=97}} Some houses in Cerra Matto (Serra East) featured privies with ceramic toilets, which were connected to a small chamber with a stone-lined clean out window to the outside and a brick ventilation flue.{{sfn|Williams|Heidorn|Tsakos|Then-Obłuska|2015|p=135}} Biconical pieces of clay served as the equivalent of toilet paper.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=171–172}}

One house in Dongola featured a vaulted bathroom, fed by a system of pipes attached to a water tank.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=172}} A furnace heated up both the water and the air, which was circulated into the richly decorated bathroom via flues in the walls.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013a|p=11}} The monastic complex of Hambukol is thought to have had a room serving as a steam bath.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=172}} The Ghazali monastery in Wadi Abu Dom also might have featured several bathrooms.{{sfn|Obłuski|2017|p=373}}

==Government==

Makuria was a monarchy ruled by a king based in Dongola. The king was also considered a priest and could perform mass. How succession was decided is not clear. Early writers indicate it was from father to son. After the 11th century, however, it seems clear that Makuria was using the uncle-to-sister&#x27;s-son system favoured for millennia in Kush. Shinnie speculates that the later form may have actually been used throughout, and that the early Arab writers merely misunderstood the situation and incorrectly described Makurian succession as similar to what they were used to.{{sfn|Shinnie|1978|p=581}} A Coptic source from the mid 8th century refers to king Cyriacos as &quot;orthodox Abyssinian king of Makuria&quot; as well as &quot;Greek king&quot;, with &quot;Abyssinian&quot; probably reflecting the Miaphysite Coptic church and &quot;Greek&quot; the Byzantine Orthodox one.{{sfn|Greisiger|2007|p=204}} In 1186 king Moses Georgios called himself &quot;king of Alodia, Makuria, Nobadia, Dalmatia{{efn|&quot;Dalmatia&quot; or &quot;Damaltia&quot; is probably an error for Tolmeita (ancient Ptolemais in Libya), which was a part of the patriarch of Alexandria&#x27;s title: &quot;archbishop of the great city of Alexandria and the city of Babylon (Cairo), and Nobadia, Alodia, Makuria, Dalmatia and Axioma (Axum).&quot; It has been proposed that there was some confusion in the 1186 document between the titles of the king and the patriarch.{{sfn|Hagen|2009|p=117}}}} and Axioma.&quot;{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=243}}

Little is known about government below the king. A wide array of officials, generally using Byzantine titles, are mentioned, but their roles are never explained. One figure who is well-known, thanks to the documents found at Qasr Ibrim, is the Eparch of Nobatia, who seems to have been the viceroy in that region after it was annexed to Makuria. The Eparch&#x27;s records make clear that he was also responsible for trade and diplomacy with the Egyptians. Early records make it seem like the Eparch was appointed by the king, but later ones indicate that the position had become hereditary.{{sfn|Adams|1991|p=258}} The elite of Makuria was drawn from noblemen who the Islamic sources called &quot;princes&quot;. It was them who constituted the courtiers, military commanders and bishops. They were apparently powerful enough to openly exlaim their discontent and even depose the ruler if they were unhappy with him, despite claims in Islamic sources that the power of the Makurian king was absolute.{{sfn|Lajtar|Ochala|2021|pp=371–372; 374–375}} A selected few of them, the elders, constituted a council that assisted the king in his decision making. The elders aside it was also the queenmother who bore a key role in advising the king. In 1292 an unnamed Makurian king is even reported to have claimed that &quot;it was only the women who direct the kings [...]&quot;{{sfn|Lajtar|Ochala|2021|pp=375–376}}

The bishops might have played a role in the governance of the state. Ibn Selim el-Aswani noted that before the king responded to his mission he met with a council of bishops.{{sfn|Jakobielski|1992|p=211}} El-Aswani described a highly centralized state, but other writers state that Makuria was a federation of thirteen kingdoms presided over by the great king at Dongola.{{sfn|Zabkar|1963|p=?}}

===Kings===
{{main|List of rulers of Makuria}}

==Religion==
===Paganism===

One of the most debated issues among scholars is over the religion of Makuria. Up to the 5th century the old faith of Meroe seems to have remained strong, even while ancient Egyptian religion, its counterpart in Egypt, disappeared. In the 5th century the Nubians went so far as to launch an invasion of Egypt when the Christians there tried to turn some of the main temples into churches.{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=440}} A portion of the Nubian population seemingly remained pagan as late as the 10th century, for el-Aswani reported that &quot;[s]ome of them do not know the Creator and adore the Sun and the Day; some others adore whatever they like; trees or animals.&quot;{{sfn|Vantini|1975|p=616}}

===Christianity===
Archaeological evidence in this period finds a number of Christian ornaments in Nubia, and some scholars feel that this implies that conversion from below was already taking place. Others argue that it is more likely that these reflected the faith of the manufacturers in Egypt rather than the buyers in Nubia.

Certain conversion came with a series of 6th-century missions. The Byzantine Empire dispatched an official party to try to convert the kingdoms to Chalcedonian Christianity, but Empress Theodora reportedly conspired to delay the party to allow a group of Miaphysites to arrive first.{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=441}} John of Ephesus reports that the Monophysites successfully converted the kingdoms of Nobatia and Alodia, but that Makuria remained hostile. John of Biclarum states that Makuria then embraced the rival Byzantine Christianity. Archaeological evidence seems to point to a rapid conversion brought about by an official adoption of the new faith. Millennia-old traditions such as the building of elaborate tombs, and the burying of expensive grave goods with the dead were abandoned, and temples throughout the region seem to have been converted to churches. Churches eventually were built in virtually every town and village.{{sfn|Shinnie|1965|p=?}}

After this point the exact course of Makurian Christianity is much disputed. It is clear that by c. 710 Makuria had become officially Coptic and loyal to the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria; the king of Makuria became the defender of the patriarch of Alexandria, occasionally intervening militarily to protect him, as Kyriakos did in 722. This same period saw Melkite Makuria absorb the Coptic Nobatia, historians have long wondered why the conquering state adopted the religion of its rival. It is fairly clear that Egyptian Coptic influence was far stronger in the region, and that Byzantine power was fading, and this might have played a role. Historians are also divided on whether this was the end of the Melkite/Coptic split as there is some evidence that a Melkite minority persisted until the end of the kingdom.

====Church infrastructure====
The Makurian church was divided into seven bishoprics: Kalabsha, Qupta, Qasr Ibrim, Faras, Sai, Dongola, and Suenkur.{{sfn|Shinnie|1978|p=583}} Unlike Ethiopia, it appears that no national church was established and all seven bishops reported directly to the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria. The bishops were appointed by the patriarch, not the king, though they seem to have largely been local Nubians rather than Egyptians.{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=472}}

====Monasticism====

Unlike in Egypt, there is not much evidence for monasticism in Makuria. According to Adams there are only three archaeological sites that are certainly monastic. All three are fairly small and quite Coptic, leading to the possibility that they were set up by Egyptian refugees rather than indigenous Makurians.{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=478}} Since the 10th/11th century the Nubians had their own monastery in the Egyptian Wadi El Natrun valley.{{sfn|al-Suriany|2013|p=257}}

===Islam===

The Baqt guaranteed the security of Muslims travelling in Makuria,{{sfn|Godlewski|2013b|p=101}} but prohibited their settlement in the kingdom. However, the latter point was, not maintained:{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=106}} Muslim migrants, probably merchants and artisans,{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=468}} are confirmed to have settled in Lower Nubia from the 9th century and to have intermarried with the locals, thus laying the foundation for a small Muslim population{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=155}} as far south as the Batn el-Hajar.{{sfn|Seignobos|2010|pp=15–16}} Arabic documents from Qasr Ibrim confirm that these Muslims had their own communal judiciary,{{sfn|Khan|2013|p=147}} but still regarded the Eparch of Nobatia as their suzerain.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=107}} It seems likely that they had own mosques, though none have been identified archaeologically,{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=468}} with a possible exception being in Gebel Adda.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=106}}

In Dongola, there was no larger number of Muslims until the end of the 13th century. Before that date, Muslim residents were limited to merchants and diplomats.{{sfn|Godlewski|2013a|p=117}} In the late 10th century, when al-Aswani came to Dongola, there was, despite being demanded in the Baqt, still no mosque; he and around 60 other Muslims had to pray outside of the city.{{sfn|Holt|2011|p=16}} It is not until 1317, with the conversion of the throne hall by Abdallah Barshambu, when a mosque is firmly attested.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=71, note 44}} While the Jizya, the Islamic head tax enforced on non-Muslims, was established after the Mamluk invasion of 1276{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=121–122}} and Makuria was periodically governed by Muslim kings since Abdallah Barshambu, the majority of the Nubians remained Christian.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=137–140}} The actual Islamization of Nubia began in the late 14th century, with the arrival of the first in a series of Muslim teachers propagating Islam.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=155–156}}
==Economy==

The main economic activity in Makuria was agriculture, with farmers growing several crops a year of barley, millet, and dates. The methods used were generally the same that had been used for millennia. Small plots of well irrigated land were lined along the banks of the Nile, which would be fertilized by the river&#x27;s annual flooding. One important technological advance was the saqiya, an oxen-powered water wheel, that was introduced in the Roman period and helped increase yields and population density.{{sfn|Shinnie|1978|p=556}} Settlement patterns indicate that land was divided into individual plots rather than as in a manorial system. The peasants lived in small villages composed of clustered houses of sun-dried brick.

Important industries included the production of pottery, based at Faras, and weaving based at Dongola. Smaller local industries include leatherworking, metalworking, and the widespread production of baskets, mats, and sandals from palm fibre.{{sfn|Jakobielski|1992|p=207}} Also important was the gold mined in the Red Sea Hills to the east of Makuria.{{sfn|Shinnie|1965|p=?}}

Cattle were of great economic importance. It is possible that their breeding and marketing was controlled by the central administration. A great assemblage of 13th century cattle bones from Old Dongola has been linked with a mass slaughter by the invading Mamluks, who attempted to weaken the Makurian economy.{{sfn|Osypinska|2015|p=269}}
Makurian trade was largely by barter as the state never adopted a currency, though Egyptian coins were common in the north.{{ref|currency}} Makurian trade with Egypt was of great importance. From Egypt a wide array of luxury and manufactured goods were imported. The main Makurian export was slaves. The slaves sent north were not from Makuria itself, but rather from further south and west in Africa. Little is known about Makurian trade and relations with other parts of Africa. There is some archaeological evidence of contacts and trade with the areas to the west, especially Kordofan. Additionally, contacts to Darfur and Kanem-Bornu seem probable, but there are only few evidences. There seem to have been important political relations between Makuria and Christian Ethiopia to the south-east. For instance, in the 10th century, Georgios II successfully intervened on behalf of the unnamed ruler at that time, and persuaded Patriarch Philotheos of Alexandria to at last ordain an &quot;abuna&quot;, or metropolitan, for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. However, there is little evidence of much other interaction between the two Christian states.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs better sources|date=February 2018}}

<text>Robert D. Haas (born 1942) is the chairman emeritus of Levi Strauss &amp; Co., son of Walter A. Haas Jr., and the great-great-grandnephew of the company&#x27;s founder, Levi Strauss. Haas served as the company&#x27;s president and CEO (1984-1999) and chairman (1989-2008), and is the last descendant of Levi Strauss to serve in those positions.

== Biography ==
Haas was born and raised in San Francisco, the son of Walter A. Haas Jr. and Evelyn Danzig Haas. Haas has two siblings: Elizabeth Jane &quot;Betsy&quot; Haas Eisenhardt (married to Roy Eisenhardt); and Walter J. Haas, co-chairman of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund and former chairman and CEO of the Oakland Athletics.

Haas received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964, where he was Phi Beta Kappa, and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Graduate School of Business in 1968, where he was named a Baker Scholar.

Haas served in the Peace Corps in the Ivory Coast from 1964 to 1966. He was a White House Fellow from 1968 to 1969. After business school, Haas worked as an associate at McKinsey &amp; Company from 1969 to 1972.

Haas joined Levi Strauss &amp; Co. in 1973 and worked in a variety of roles. He was elected to the board of directors in 1979 and as president and chief executive officer in 1984, until he stepped down in 1999. He served as chairman of the board from 1989 until 2008, and retired from the board in 2014.

Sales and profitability grew during the period of Haas&#x27;s leadership, thanks largely to the expansion of Levi&#x27;s branded apparel internationally and the creation and rapid growth of the Dockers brand of casual apparel. Under his leadership, Levi Strauss &amp; Company carried on the company&#x27;s engagement in corporate social responsibility: it became the first company to define and enforce workplace and safety standards for employees.

From his appointment as CEO in 1984, Haas was instrumental in redefining the company&#x27;s business strategy: He created a flatter organization – including the reduction of the workforce by one third. He also invested heavily in new product development, marketing, and technology.

In 1985, Haas returned the company to private ownership. At the time it was announced, the Levi&#x27;s LBO was the largest in U.S. business history.

During his tenure, Haas built upon the ethical traditions of Levi&#x27;s. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Robert&#x27;s grandfather, Walter A. Haas Sr., and great uncle, Daniel E. Koshland Sr., refused to lay off idled employees, risking bankruptcy. Instead they created work projects such as laying wooden floors in the company&#x27;s factory in San Francisco. Walter Haas Jr. and his brother Peter insisted on running integrated factories in the American South, giving equal treatment to all races during the era of segregation. During his tenure as leader at Levi Strauss, Haas tried to create a corporate culture in which tens of thousands of employees around the world were treated fairly and well. In addition, the company led the way in addressing a range of social and business issues. In 1982, the company became the first prominent business to become involved in addressing the problems of HIV/AIDS, at the time a largely unknown disease. Under his leadership the company pioneered corporate standards for dealing with HIV-positive employees and created employee AIDS awareness programs. Since the early 1980s the Levi Strauss Foundation has donated over to AIDS-oriented non-profits. In 1991 Haas was the first person to be awarded the Edward N. Brandt Jr. Award from the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS for his significant efforts in the fight against HIV and AIDS in the workplace.

In 1992, Levi Strauss became the first Fortune 500 company to extend health-care benefits to the unmarried partners of its employees, starting the acceptance of this practice by other leading companies. In that same year the company published the first-ever corporate standards governing the treatment of employees in contractor factories around the world. Since then, these guidelines have been largely adopted by the apparel and footwear industries.

==Philanthropy==
Active in support of his alma mater, he endowed the Haas Scholars Program at Berkeley, which funds financial aid eligible, academically talented undergraduates to engage in a sustained research, field-study or creative project in the summer before and during their senior year at Berkeley. Each year, twenty Haas Scholars are selected from all disciplines and departments across the university on the basis of the merit and originality of their project proposals. He was a member of Berkeley&#x27;s Board of Visitors, national giving chair for the Campaign for Berkeley, a board member of the Haas School, and, in 2007, the recipient of the Chancellor&#x27;s Award. In 2008, Berkeley established the Robert D. Haas Chancellor’s Chair in Equity and Inclusion in his honor. He is a trustee of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, a San Francisco-based private family foundation established in 1953 with the goal to form a righteous and supportive society that offers basic rights and opportunities to all people. Haas joined the fund&#x27;s board of directors in 1992 and is chair of the audit committee. He is a former member of the Trilateral Commission, trustee of the Ford Foundation, member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and honorary trustee of the Brookings Institution, the California Business Roundtable and the Bay Area Council. In addition, Haas is the former chairman of Stanford&#x27;s Humanities and Sciences Council as well as the former president of the Levi Strauss Foundation. He is also a donor and supporter of Immigrants Rising.

==Accolades==
In 1998, President Bill Clinton honored Haas with the first annual Ron Brown Leadership Award in recognition of the company&#x27;s anti-racism initiative called &quot;Project Change&quot;.

In 2009, Haas was selected as the &quot;Alumnus of the Year&quot; of the University of California, Berkeley.

==Personal life==
In 1974, he married attorney Colleen Gershon; they have a daughter, Elise.

<doc id="1073730" wikidata="Q1146351" url="?curid=1073730" title="Allan Arbus">
<text>Allan Franklin Arbus (February 15, 1918 – April 19, 2013) was an American actor and photographer. He was the former husband of photographer Diane Arbus. He is known for his role as psychiatrist Dr. Sidney Freedman on the CBS television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

==Early life==
Arbus was born in New York City, to a Jewish family, the son of fur retailer Harry Arbus and his wife Rose (). He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, where he first developed an interest in acting while appearing in a student play.

Also a music lover, before becoming an actor, he was reportedly so taken by Benny Goodman&#x27;s recordings that he took up playing the clarinet.

==Photography career==
During the 1940s, Arbus became a photographer for the United States Army. In 1946, after he completed his military service, he and his first wife, photographer Diane Arbus (née Nemerov, whom he had married in 1941), started a photographic advertising business in Manhattan. Arbus was primarily known for advertising photography that appeared in &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and other magazines, as well as the weekly newspaper advertising photography for Russeks, a Fifth Avenue department store in Manhattan co-founded by Diane&#x27;s grandfather, Frank Russek.

Edward Steichen&#x27;s noted photo exhibition &quot;The Family of Man&quot; includes a photograph credited to the couple. The Arbuses&#x27; professional partnership ended in 1956, when Diane quit the business; the couple formally separated three years later. Allan Arbus continued on as a solo photographer, but had given up the business to pursue an acting career by the time the couple divorced in 1969.

==Acting career==
After the breakup of his first marriage and the dissolution of his business, Arbus moved to California in 1969 to pursue a new career in acting. His new career took off after he landed the lead role in Robert Downey Sr.&#x27;s 1972 cult film, &quot;Greaser&#x27;s Palace&quot;, in which he appears with Robert Downey, Jr., who would go on to star as Diane Arbus&#x27;s muse in &quot;Fur&quot;. The 2006 &quot;Fur&quot; is a fictional account of the end of the Arbuses&#x27; marriage. Arbus also starred opposite Bette Davis in &quot;Scream, Pretty Peggy&quot; (1973), and was featured as Gregory LaCava in &quot;W.C. Fields and Me&quot; (1976).

These roles led to his casting as Maj. Sidney Freedman on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.
His work on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; helped his career as a character actor, and he eventually appeared in more than seventy TV shows and movies. He appeared briefly in the 1973 film &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; as a drunken sailor; another 1973 film, &quot;Coffy&quot; (starring Pam Grier), featured Arbus as a drug dealer with strange sexual needs; in &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot; (1978), he played Pasarian, one of Damien&#x27;s many victims in &quot;The Omen&quot; trilogy. In 1979, he portrayed a dance choreographer in &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot;.

Arbus is far better known for his television work, which includes over forty-five titles, with works as recent as &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in 2000. Among Arbus&#x27;s non-&quot;M*A*S*H&quot; work for television are guest and recurring roles in such television series as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, and &quot;Judging Amy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Allan and Diane Arbus had two daughters, photographer Amy Arbus, and writer and art director Doon Arbus. The couple separated in 1959 and divorced in 1969, two years before Diane Arbus&#x27;s suicide in 1971.

Arbus married actress Mariclare Costello in 1977. The couple had one daughter, Arin Arbus, who is the associate artistic director at Theatre for a New Audience.

==Death==
Arbus died of congestive heart failure on April 19, 2013, in Los Angeles. He was 95. He was cremated and his ashes given to his family.

<text>Savski Venac (, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. According to the 2022 census results, the municipality has a population of 36,699 inhabitants.

It is one of the three municipalities which constitute the very center of Belgrade, together with Stari Grad and Vračar.

Savski Venac is located on the right bank of the Sava river. It stretches in the north-south direction for (from downtown Belgrade, just from Terazije, to Banjica) and east-west direction for (from Senjak and the Sava bank to Autokomanda). It borders the municipalities of Stari Grad to the north, Vračar to the north-east, Voždovac to the east, Rakovica to the south and Čukarica to the west.

==History and name==
While Savski Venac and Stari Grad are often styled &quot;the oldest municipalities&quot; of Belgrade due to their inclusion of the oldest sections of urban Belgrade outside the walls of the Kalemegdan fortress, they are actually the most recently created municipalities of Belgrade. Both were formed in 1957 by merger of older, smaller municipalities; Savski Venac was formed in by merger of the municipalities of Zapadni Vračar (its main predecessor) and Topčidersko Brdo and a new, geographical name, &quot;Savski Venac&quot;, was coined for it.

(&quot;Venac&quot; is usually used in Belgrade&#x27;s geography in term of a round street (&quot;Obilićev Venac&quot;, &quot;Kosančićev Venac&quot;) or a rim of the river (Dunavski Venac). In this case it was the &quot;rim of the Sava&quot;.)

==Geography==

With an area of , Savski Venac is the third smallest municipality of Belgrade after Vračar and Stari Grad. Despite being small in area, it includes several diverse geographical features:

*the low section on the right bank of the Sava river (Savamala and Bara Venecija). Due to its low altitude toward the Sava, and lack of any protection, this is the only part of central urban area of Belgrade that gets flooded during the extremely high waters of the river. It was almost completely flooded in 1984 and during major floods in 2006.
*southern slopes of the hill of Terazije (Terazijska Terasa) which descends from downtown Belgrade to the Sava.
*entire western slope of the Vračar Hill (Karađorđev Park and former Zapadni Vračar) which also descends to the Sava.
*southern slope of the Vračar Hill, known as the Guberevac Hill or Ludo Brdo (&quot;Crazy Hill&quot;) as it is the location of the psychiatric hospital &quot;Laza Lazarević&quot;.
*the former valley of the stream od Mokroluški Potok, now conducted underground. It is a route to the modern highway and the new railstation of Prokop.
*the hill of Topčidersko Brdo which has a cliff-like edge above the Sava (Senjak).
*the hill of Banjica in the extreme south of the municipality.
*the upper valley of Topčiderska reka and the vast park-forest of Topčider.
==Neighborhoods==
==Demographics==
According to the census of 2022, Savski Venac has a population of 36,699 inhabitants. As all the other central city municipalities, it has been depopulating for decades, however, it still remains one of the most densely populated: (4,686/km² or 12,136/sq mi back in 1961).

==Sport==
Sportsko Selo (&quot;Sport Village&quot;) – In the early 1970s a football pitch was built at the end of the &quot;Deligradska&quot; street, right above the highway. It was adapted into the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Ground, but in the early 1990s the location was abandoned. The lot was left unattended and gradually turned into a rubbish dump. In 2009 a project for the ground was jointly drafted by the city and the municipality with the working title &quot;Ada Ciganlija u malom&quot;. After two years of construction, the new complex was opened on 30 May 2011. It covers an area of and contains one volleyball, three basketball and four tennis courts, children playgrounds and a fitness plateau. There are also a futsal and bocce courts, outdoor gym, walking paths, rest areas, wooden ice-cream kiosk and a parking lot. The complex is situated in a wooded area and includes an amphitheater suitable for the theatrical performances in the open. Invited to choose the name for the complex between the originally proposed &quot;Ada Ciganlija u malom&quot; and &quot;Sportsko Selo&quot; which appeared during the construction, citizens picked the latter.

<doc id="1073739" wikidata="Q2915349" url="?curid=1073739" title="Neurodiversity">
<text>The neurodiversity paradigm is a framework for understanding human brain function that considers the diversity within sensory processing, motor abilities, social comfort, cognition, and focus as neurobiological differences. This diversity falls on a spectrum of neurocognitive differences. The neurodiversity paradigm argues that diversity in neurocognition is part of humanity and that some neurodivergences generally classified as disorders, such as autism, are differences with strengths and weaknesses as well as disabilities that are not necessarily pathological. Neurotypical individuals are those who fall within the average range of functioning and thinking.

The neurodiversity movement started in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the start of Autism Network International. Much of the correspondence that led to the formation of the movement happened over autism conferences, namely the autistic-led autreat, penpal lists, and Usenet. The framework grew out of the disability rights movement and builds on the social model of disability, arguing that disability partly arises from societal barriers and person-environment mismatch, rather than attributing disability purely to inherent deficits. It instead situates human cognitive variation in the context of biodiversity and the politics of minority groups. Some neurodiversity advocates and researchers including Judy Singer and Patrick Dwyer argue that the neurodiversity paradigm is the middle ground between a strong medical model and a strong social model.

Neurodivergent individuals face unique challenges in education and the workplace. The efficacy of accessibility and support programs in career development and higher education differs from individual to individual. Social media has introduced a platform where neurodiversity awareness and support has emerged, further promoting the neurodiversity movement.

The neurodiversity paradigm has been controversial among disability advocates, especially proponents of the medical model of autism, with opponents arguing it risks downplaying the challenges associated with some disabilities (e.g., in those requiring little support becoming representative of the challenges caused by the disability, thereby making it more difficult to seek desired treatment), and that it calls for the acceptance of things some wish to be treated for. In recent years, to address these concerns, some neurodiversity advocates and researchers have attempted to reconcile what they consider different seemingly contradictory but arguably partially compatible perspectives. Some researchers have advocated for mixed or integrative approaches that involve both neurodiversity approaches and biomedical interventions or advancements, for example teaching functional communication (whether it be spoken or not) and treating self-injurious behaviors or co-occurring conditions like anxiety and depression with biomedical approaches.

== History and developments ==
The word &quot;neurodiversity&quot; first appeared in publication in 1998, in an article by American journalist Harvey Blume, as a portmanteau of the words &quot;neurological diversity&quot;, which had been used as early as 1996 in online spaces such as InLv to describe the growing concept of a natural diversity in humanity&#x27;s neurological expression. The same year, it was published in Judy Singer&#x27;s sociology honors thesis, drawing on discussions on the independent living mailing list that included Blume. Singer has described herself as &quot;likely somewhere on the autistic spectrum&quot;.

Blume was an early advocate who predicted the role the Internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; piece on June 30, 1997, Blume described the foundation of neurodiversity using the term &quot;neurological pluralism&quot;. Some authors also credit the earlier work of autistic advocate Jim Sinclair in laying the foundation for the movement. Sinclair&#x27;s 1993 speech &quot;Don&#x27;t Mourn For Us&quot; emphasized autism as a way of being, claiming &quot;it is not possible to separate the person from the autism.&quot;

The Neurodiversity Movement grew largely from online interaction. The internet&#x27;s design lent well to the needs of many autistic people. People socialized over listservs and IRCs. Some of the websites used for organizing in the Neurodiversity Movement&#x27;s early days include sites like Autistics.Org and Autistic People Against Neuroleptic Abuse. Core principles were developed from there. Principles such as advocating for the rights and autonomy of all people with brain disabilities with a focus on autism. The main conflicts from the beginning were about who the real experts on autism are, what causes autism, what interventions are appropriate, and who gets to call themselves autistic. During the 2000s, people started blogs such as Mel Baggs&#x27; Ballastexistenz and Kevin Leitch&#x27;s Left Brain Right Brain. Eventually, Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) was started by Ari Ne&#x27;eman and Scott Robertson to further align the Neurodiversity Movement with the greater disability rights movement. ASAN led the Ransom Notes Campaign to successfully remove stigmatizing disability ads posted by the NYU Child Study Center. This was a massive turning point for the Neurodiversity Movement.

From there, the Neurodiversity Movement continued to grow with the formation of more organizations in the early 2010s such as Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network and The Thinking Person&#x27;s Guide to Autism. More autistic people were appointed to federal advisory boards like Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee and National Council on Disability. There were various campaigns like the ongoing #StopTheShock related to the use of aversive treatment at Judge Rotenberg Center and various protests against Autism Speaks. Various flashblogs popped up during the 2010s to support campaigns. Annual traditions were formed such as Disability Day of Mourning and Autistics Speaking Day.

Damian Milton notes that, in 2014, Nick Walker attempted to define neurodiversity, the neurodiversity movement, and the neurodiversity paradigm. Walker tied neurodiversity to the idea that &quot;all brains are to a degree unique&quot;. She also defined the movement as a rights movement, and the paradigm as a broader discussion of diversity, cultural constructions and social dynamics.

An important question is which neurodivergences traditionally viewed as disorders should be depathologized and exempt from attempts to remove them. Autistic advocate Nick Walker suggested preserving &quot;forms of innate or largely innate neurodivergence, like autism&quot; while conditions like epilepsy or traumatic brain injury could be removed from the person without fundamentally changing the person because these are not pervasively linked to the individual&#x27;s personality or perception of the world.

== Scientific debates, research findings, and neurodiversity-based reforms ==
In recent years, the concept of neurodiversity and many related findings have gained traction among many members of the scientific community, who have argued that autism researchers have sometimes been too ready to interpret differences as deficits. It has also been suggested that there are both ethical issues and practical risks in attempting to reduce or suppress some autistic traits (e.g. some stimming behaviors that do not cause harm to self or others, focused interests) that can sometimes be adaptive or instilling neurotypical social behaviors (e.g. eye contact, body language) through interventions. Researchers and advocates are concerned about such issues and risks as most recent studies and multiple systematic reviews have indicated that higher levels of masking, passing as neurotypical, or camouflaging are generally associated with poorer mental health outcomes including depression, clinical anxiety, and suicidality among autistic people (including children, adolescents, and adults) and across various regions or cultures. In addition, two reviews published in 2024 indicated some forms of repetitive behaviors can be adaptive for sensory regulation and emotional regulation of some autistic people, and masking or suppressing some autistic repetitive behaviors that can be adaptive may risk worsening mental health and well-being. One multiple-year longitudinal study found that autistic children who showed decrease in repetitive behaviors experienced more severe and worsening in mental health symptoms, whereas autistic children who showed increase in repetitive behaviors experienced less severe mental health symptoms. Relatedly, qualitative studies have shown some forms of behavioral interventions increase camouflaging or masking of autistic traits (e.g. stimming) for some autistic people, with negative effects on mental health. In addition, quantitative evidence regarding adverse effects (e.g. in terms of trauma and reinforcement of masking) of some behavioral interventions is limited but emerging.

Moreover, researchers have found that psychoeducation based on the medical model is associated with higher stigma. Another study found that endorsements of normalization and curative goals (goals of some medical models) are associated with heightened stigma. Similarly, some researchers and advocates also argue that a medicalizing approach can contribute to stigma and ableism, and that the persistent focus on biological research in autism based on deficit-based medical model is at odds with the priorities of those in the autism community.

The neurodiversity paradigm is controversial in autism advocacy. A prevalent criticism is that autistic people with higher support needs would continue to have challenges even if society was fully accommodating and accepting of them. Some critics of the neurodiversity paradigm, such as family members that are responsible for the care of such an autistic individual, think it might lead to overlooking or downplaying these challenges. In response, it has been stated that neurodiversity does not deny disability and support needs and that not having certain abilities or needing support is not intrinsically a bad thing, because notions of normal functioning are culturally and economically relative and historically contingent and there are cultures in which questions like &quot;Will my child ever be able to live independently?&quot; or &quot;Who will care for my child after I die?&quot; do not arise because support is provided by other members of the community as a matter of course.

Autistic self-advocate and researcher Ari Ne&#x27;eman has suggested a trait-based approach, where elements of the medical (or pathology) model can be applied in treating certain traits, behaviors, or conditions that are intrinsically harmful (e.g. self-injury behaviors, epilepsy, or other co-occurring health conditions), while neurodiversity approaches can be applied to non-harmful or sometimes adaptive autistic traits (e.g. some stimming behaviors that do not result in self-injury, intense interests) of the same individual. Relatedly, some neurodiversity researchers, as well as autistic people, advocates and researchers, have advocated for application and sometimes integration or combination of both neurodiversity approaches and biomedical research plus practice.

In recent years, researchers and neurodivergent people have advocated for more neurodiversity-affirming interventions, with both new intervention strategies being developed and advancements or reforms of existing intervention strategies (e.g. social skills training, ABA interventions, occupational therapy) informed by experiences, strengths, interests, preferences, and feedback of autistic people as well as neurodiversity approaches and findings, with some evidence for beneficial effects. In addition, some researchers and advocates have called for more neurodiversity-affirming psychoeducation and stigma reduction methods.

==Neurodivergent and neurotypical/neuroconforming==

According to Kassiane Asasumasu, who coined the terms in the year 2000, neurodivergent/neurodivergence refers to those &quot;whose neurocognitive functioning diverges from dominant societal norms in multiple ways&quot;. She emphasized that it should not be used to exclude people but rather to include them and therefore intended for these terms to apply to a broad variety of people, not just people with neurodevelopmental differences, such as autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dyslexia. It is also used as an umbrella term to describe people with atypical mental and behavioral traits, such as mood, personality, and eating disorders.

Under the neurodiversity framework, these differences are often referred to as &quot;neurodivergences&quot;, in an effort to move away from the medical model of disability (sometimes referred to in the neurodiversity community as the &quot;pathology paradigm&quot;). This term provided activists a way to advocate for increased rights and accessibility for non-autistic people who do not have a neurocognitive functioning that is considered typical.

Neurotypical (an abbreviation of neurologically typical, sometimes NT) is a neologism widely used in the neurodiversity movement as a label for anyone who has a neurotype that fits into the norm of thinking patterns. Thus, the term &quot;neurotypical&quot; includes anyone who is not autistic, and does not have ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, or any other difference that would be considered neurodivergent. The term has been adopted by both the neurodiversity movement and some members of the scientific community.

Neuroscience writer Mo Costandi views terms like &quot;neurotypical&quot; as not being of use in neuroscience, while others, including Uta Frith and Francesca Happé, use the term freely. Ginny Russell mentions that there is no clear bimodal distribution separating autistic and non-autistic people because many non-autistic people have some autistic traits. Another criticism, that &quot;neurotypical&quot; was a dubious construct because there is nobody who could be considered truly neurotypical, has been said by Nick Walker to reflect a misunderstanding of the term because it is meant to describe those who can adapt to society&#x27;s norms without much effort, not to imply that all neurotypical people&#x27;s brains are the same.

Early definitions described neurotypicals as individuals who are not autistic. Early uses of NT were often satirical, as in the Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical, but it has been adopted by the neurodiversity movement too, and is now used in a serious manner.

In contrast to some of the shortcomings of terms like &quot;neurotypical&quot; (such as its underlying assumption that neurodivergent experiences are an anomaly, &quot;i.e.&quot; not typical), a growing group of advocates in the neurodivergent movement prefer other terms such as &quot;neuroconforming&quot;. The term &quot;allistic&quot; is also used, meaning &quot;not autistic&quot;.

== Double empathy theory ==
The theory of the double empathy problem argues that autistic people do not inherently lack empathy as often supposed by people who see autism as pathological, but most autistic people may struggle in understanding and empathizing for non-autistic people whereas most non-autistic people also lack understanding and empathy for autistic people. It was originally conceived in 2012 by autistic scholar Damian Milton. The theory argues that characteristics and experiences of autistic and non-autistic people are so different that it is hard for one to understand how the other thinks and empathize with each other; for example, non-autistic people may not understand when an autistic person is overwhelmed.

An increasing number of studies in the 2010s and 2020s found support for double empathy theory and related concepts such as bidirectional social interaction. One study comparing the conversations and socialization of autistic groups, non-autistic groups, and mixed groups found that autistic people were more able to build rapport with other autistic people than with non-autistic people, and at a level similar to the purely non-autistic group. A systematic review published in 2024 found that most autistic people have good interpersonal relations and social-communication experiences with most autistic people, and interactions between autistic people are associated with better quality of life across multiple domains, including mental health and emotional well-being.

The double empathy problem theory implies there is no simple fix that can help each group better empathize with each other, but it is worthwhile to bridge the double empathy gap through more equal contact and enhancing public understanding and empathy about autistic people based on neurodiversity-affirming approaches. The advantage of the theory is reducing pathologization of autistic people by identifying that most people struggle to empathize with people with different neurotypes. It can also help neurotypical individuals to better understand how neurodivergent people think and empathize and to recognize their own limitations in empathizing with autistic people. Jaswal and Akhtar (2019) highlight the difference between &quot;being&quot; socially uninterested and &quot;appearing&quot; socially uninterested, and challenge preconceived notions of a lack of social motivation. For example, testimonies from autistic individuals report that avoiding eye contact serves an important function of helping them to concentrate during conversation, and should not be interpreted as expressing social disinterest.

== Within disability rights movements ==
The neurodiversity paradigm was developed and embraced first by autistic people, but has been applied to other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental speech disorders, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, dysnomia, intellectual disability, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome, and sometimes mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and, somewhat more controversially, personality disorders such as antisocial personality disorder. Neurodiversity advocates and organizations like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) do not agree with using medical interventions as a way to remove neurodevelopmental differences that are fundamentally linked to the personality and perception of the world, such as autism. Rather, they promote support systems such as inclusion-focused services, accommodations, communication and assistive technologies, occupational training, and independent living support. The intention is for individuals to receive support that honors human diversity and feel that they are able to freely express themselves. Other forms of interventions may cause them to feel as though they are being coerced or forced to adapt to social norms, or to conform to a behavioral standard or clinical ideal.

Proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by acknowledging that neurodivergence is not something that needs to be cured and that the idea of curing it makes no conceptual sense because differences like autism are so pervasive that removing the autistic parts of the person is tantamount to replacing the autistic person by a different person. An important aim is also changing the language from the current &quot;condition, disease, disorder, or illness&quot;-based nomenclature, &quot;broadening the understanding of healthy or independent living&quot;, acknowledging new types of autonomy, and giving neurodivergent individuals more control over their interventions, including the type, timing, and whether there should be interventions at all.

Activists such as Jennifer White-Johnson have helped bring attention to the neurodiversity movement, by creating symbols of protest and recognition, including a combination of the black power fist and infinity symbol.

A 2009 study separated 27 students with conditions including autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADHD, and having suffered a stroke into two categories of self-view: &quot;A &#x27;difference&#x27; view—where neurodiversity was seen as a difference incorporating a set of strengths and weaknesses, or a &#x27;medical/deficit&#x27; view—where neurodiversity was seen as a disadvantageous medical condition&quot;. They found that, although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from the &quot;difference&quot; view (41% of the study cohort) &quot;indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals&quot;. Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.

A 2013 online survey which aimed to assess conceptions of autism and neurodiversity suggested that conception of autism as a difference, and not a deficit, is developmentally beneficial and &quot;transcend[s] a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit&quot;.

Neurodiversity advocate John Elder Robison argues that the disabilities and strengths conferred by neurological differences may be mutually inseparable. &quot;When 99 neurologically identical people fail to solve a problem, it&#x27;s often the 1% fellow who&#x27;s different who holds the key. Yet that person may be disabled or disadvantaged most or all of the time. To neurodiversity proponents, people are disabled because they are at the edges of the bell curve, not because they are sick or broken.&quot;

== Higher education ==
There are several models that are used to understand disability. There is the medical model of disability that views people as needing to be treated or cured. Another model is the social model of disability, which puts emphasis on the way that society treats people with disabilities. Through the social model of disability, the experiences of neurodivergent students in higher education are partially influenced by the reactions and attitudes of other students and the institution itself.

=== Experiences of neurodivergent students ===
The emotional experiences of neurodivergent students in higher education depend on a combination of factors, including the type of disability, the level of support needs, and the student&#x27;s access to resources and accommodations. A common difficulty for neurodivergent students is maintaining social relationships, which can give rise to loneliness, anxiety, and depression. There is also the added stress and difficulty of transitioning into higher education, as well as the responsibilities and task management required in college. Many neurodivergent students may find that they need added support. As for academics, neurodivergent students may experience difficulties in learning, executive function, managing peer relationships in the classroom or in group work, and other difficulties that can affect academic performance and success in higher education. However, neurodivergent students may find that their differences are a strength and an integral part of their new social roles as adults.

=== Higher education institutions ===
The typical curriculum and format of higher education may pose as a challenge for neurodivergent students, and a lack of support and flexibility from staff may further complicate the university experience. Thus, reasonable adjustments are available to students who disclose their disabilities. However, these adjustments or accommodations may put an emphasis on academics, and less on the various challenges of higher education on neurodivergent students. For instance, neurodivergent students in higher education also report a need for non-academic supports, such as social mentorships and resources for strength-based interventions in order to further assist neurodivergent students in the social aspects of college life. Similarly, career preparation that is specifically targeted for neurodivergent students is lacking. There are several programs, such as supported employment, that exist to help assist neurodivergent individuals in finding and obtaining a job. However, many of these programs do not exist in schools. This can make it difficult for neurodivergent students to find a career path that they feel is attainable for them. Another consideration is the implementation of a universal design approach (UDL) when building learning spaces or communal areas that considers the needs of neurodivergent students. A UDL design incorporates a design that accommodates the needs of all students, including the neurodivergent population.

According to an article published in 2023, universities and post-secondary establishments would show more tolerance towards neurodivergent people. A tolerant environment can increase autonomy, leading to kindness and understanding among students. Higher education institutions offer counseling and support services to students. However, neurodivergent students face particular challenges that impair their ability to receive consistent support and care. Additionally, counseling and support services face a lack of funding, personnel, and specialists that can adequately support neurodivergent students. Overall, these services work for some students and not for others.

Nachman and colleagues reviewed several articles published by two-year community colleges and found some discrepancies in the way that they perceived and categorized &quot;disabled&quot; students and &quot;non-disabled&quot; students. They found that all of the articles were attempting to normalize disability. Many of them put a distinct separation between typical and atypical learners as well as their potential academic achievement. Nachman also found that many of the articles showed a lack of autonomy for neurodivergent students. They had little power in regard to academic choices and classroom management.

== In the workplace ==
Neurodivergent individuals are subjected to bias when applying and interviewing for job positions. Specifically, neurodivergent individuals can have their social engagement style compared to neurotypical individuals, which can affect their ability to obtain a job position. Stigmas against neurodivergence (especially against autistic individuals) and cognition challenges in social situations can hinder an individual&#x27;s ability to perform well in a traditional job interview. Organizations such as Specialisterne aim to use neurodivergent employees&#x27; particular skills – such as pattern recognition, detection of deviations, attention to detail, analytical thinking, and extended focus – in the workforce, as well as educate companies on supporting neurodivergent employees.

In a systematic review that considered developmental dyslexia as &quot;an expression of neurodiversity&quot;, it was suggested that neurodiversity is not yet an established concept in the workplace, and therefore, support from social relationships and work accommodations is minimal. Furthermore, another systematic review that focused on pharmacological and combined pharmacological/psychosocial interventions for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder found that there were few workplace-based intervention studies, and suggested that additional research needs to be conducted to figure out how to best support neurodivergent employees in the workplace.

A study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that neurodivergent individuals would benefit from remote work as it allowed them to engage in their interests, but that social engagement is still necessary for productivity and performance. Another study supported these findings and stressed the need for redesigned work and social conditions to be more inclusive for autistic individuals.

== In social media ==
The increase in representation of the neurodiversity movement in the media came about with changes in the technology of the media platforms themselves. The recent addition of text-based options on various social media sites allows disabled users to communicate, enjoy, and share at a more accessible rate. Social media has a two-fold benefit to the neurodivergent community: it can help spread awareness and pioneer the neurodiversity movement, and it can also allow members of the communities themselves to connect.

=== Social media as a platform ===
Media platforms allow the connection of individuals of similar backgrounds to find a community of support with one another. Online networking and connections enable users to determine their comfort level in interactions, giving them control over their relationships with others. For the neurodivergent community, social media has proven to be a valuable tool for forming relationships, especially for those who find social situations challenging. By connecting neurodivergent users, media platforms provide &quot;safe spaces&quot; that are helpful in forming relationships. Some media developers have created platforms like Blossom that are designed specifically to connect neurodivergent users and families.

=== Social media as a driving force ===
Social media also allows users to spread awareness about the neurodiversity movement. Increasing awareness about mental conditions has been shown to increase the amount of factual information spread. The spread of information through social media exposure can assist the neurodiversity movement in educating the public about understanding disabilities such as autism and sifting out misinformation. By sharing neurodivergent experiences from a first-hand perspective, social media can educate the public and destigmatize certain conditions. Still, negative portrayals of neurodivergence can have an obstructive impact on members of the community.

Higher awareness and acceptance through social media can lead people to self-identify as neurodivergent. Generally, self-diagnosis is discouraged in psychiatry because it is thought to be wrong more often than a professional assessment and because it is said that it trivializes challenges by turning them into fashion labels. Robert Chapman, in contrast, questions the reliability of professional autism assessments as they often overlook the experiences of individuals who are not white cisgender male children and states that self-identification is not done for fashion purposes but because it helps understanding one&#x27;s strengths and challenges. Sue Fletcher-Watson argues that because autism should not be classified as a disorder and no treatment should follow a diagnosis, autistic individuals should have the autonomy to self-identify as autistic, liberating them from the power of medical professionals in defining autism and determining who belongs to the autistic community. A group of researchers created a preliminary self-report questionnaire for autistic people.

=== Challenges within media ===
Although representation of the neurodivergent community has grown with the help of social media platforms, those users are often criticized and misunderstood. Social media has not entirely removed the social barriers that restrict inclusion of neurodivergent people. Some have reported needing to conform to the mainstream view of their disability to be seen as &quot;authentic&quot; users. Doing so has indirectly made it more difficult for neurodivergent users to grow platforms. Non-disabled users assessing the authenticity of neurodivergent individuals based on stereotypes indicates that the neurodiversity movement has not achieved its goal of inclusion.

== Clinical setting ==
=== Medicine and healthcare ===
Medical and healthcare professionals have begun to acknowledge neurodivergence among employees. Specifically, more groups are being created that are centered around advocacy and peer support among medical and healthcare professionals who associate themselves with neurodiversity, such as the Autistic Doctors International created by Dr. Mary Doherty. Another approach is the implementation of a 5-minute video summary (5MVS) for medical learners and physicians who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It consists of a 5-minute recorded video summary in which an engaging speaker presents the relevant information from a scientific article about ADHD using a brief PowerPoint presentation shared using videoconferencing technology. The researchers state that providing this educational tool for helping medical learners and physicians with ADHD acquire relevant information from scientific articles could help in addressing their inattention, impulsivity or hyperactivity, and improve their development of critical appraisal skills when working in healthcare.

Similarly, healthcare systems may benefit from hiring neurodivergent individuals to gain a unique perspective when caring for patients. Some healthcare staff agree that inviting neurodivergent individuals to join patient advisory groups or hiring them as staff are essential steps to acceptance and integration in the workforce. Neurodivergent people&#x27;s unique strengths can be vital to health system innovation and improvement efforts. One example of the push toward this is the Stanford Neurodiversity Project, in which one of their goals is to discover the strengths of neurodivergent individuals and make use of their talents to increase innovation and productivity of their society, such as working in the field of healthcare and medicine.

Neurodiversity has also recently been investigated as a new way of working within neurodevelopmental clinics in the UK. A team of researchers in Portsmouth, England, have created an approach in aiding neurodivergent individuals known as PANDA, or the Portsmouth Alliance Neurodiversity Approach. This approach may help medical and healthcare professionals facilitate understanding, communication and early support for children who may identify as being neurodivergent.

=== Therapy ===
Neurodiversity and the role it plays in therapeutic settings has been a central focal point in recent years. Many therapists and mental health professionals have pushed for more inclusive psychotherapeutic frameworks appropriate for neurodivergent individuals. One example is neurodivergence-informed therapy, which reframes dysfunction as interconnectedness among society rather than strictly individual, advocating for acceptance and pride in the neurodiversity community, and the push for therapists to pursue humility regarding the knowledge and education associated with individuals who identify as neurodivergent. Similarly, neurodiversity affirming therapy supports neurodivergent differences, rather than viewing them as something that should be eliminated, and to offer ways to support the individual with difficult areas, while still appreciating their needs and strengths.

Therapeutic programs and interventions are also being investigated for the neurodivergent community. Self-determination programs to help neurodivergent individuals achieve goals in their life have been found to be successful, with neurodivergent participants finding it to be &quot;appropriate, acceptable, and feasible&quot;. Various approaches (e.g., eye-tracking, longitudinal data, computational modeling) in understanding perceptual decision-making in neurodivergent individuals are also being studied and the implications it may have in the therapeutic environment in working with the neurodivergent population.

Another form of therapeutic intervention in that has been investigated in neurodivergent individuals is the use of Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs). NDBIs have been shown to have positive effects on language and social-communication while, at the same time, respecting individuals&#x27; needs and autonomy. One of the key goals in this type of intervention is putting the focus of therapy on the neurodivergent individual themselves in the creation of intervention goals, procedures, and outcomes. In doing so, they are likely to be seen as more acceptable, useful, and effective to that individual.

In addition to support from neurodiversity advocates for affirming therapies, concerns have been raised about the role of certain approaches such as applied behavior analysis. Neurodivergent individuals and activists tend to emphasize that these interventions aim to enforce conformity with expectations of society rather than addressing the needs of the person receiving the intervention. While a large body of research on the role of ABA seems to support its efficacy in cognitive and behavioral outcomes, a meta-analysis by Sandbank et al. challenges the evidence. Additionally, there are concerns regarding long-term mental health impacts and with the measures used in determining social validity by those who have raised these concerns. In addition to advocates from within the neurodivergent community, some behavioral analysts have begun to reconsider the role of these therapies with the context of a neurodiversity framework.

<doc id="1073746" wikidata="Q4975963" url="?curid=1073746" title="Brown's representability theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Brown&#x27;s representability theorem in homotopy theory gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a contravariant functor &quot;F&quot; on the homotopy category &quot;Hotc&quot; of pointed connected CW complexes, to the category of sets Set, to be a representable functor.

More specifically, we are given

:&quot;F&quot;: &quot;Hotc&quot;op → Set,

and there are certain obviously necessary conditions for &quot;F&quot; to be of type &quot;Hom&quot;(—, &quot;C&quot;), with &quot;C&quot; a pointed connected CW-complex that can be deduced from category theory alone. The statement of the substantive part of the theorem is that these necessary conditions are then sufficient. For technical reasons, the theorem is often stated for functors to the category of pointed sets; in other words the sets are also given a base point.

==Brown representability theorem for CW complexes==

The representability theorem for CW complexes, due to Edgar H. Brown, is the following. Suppose that:
# The functor &quot;F&quot; maps coproducts (i.e. wedge sums) in &quot;Hotc&quot; to products in &quot;Set&quot;: formula_1
# The functor &quot;F&quot; maps homotopy pushouts in &quot;Hotc&quot; to weak pullbacks. This is often stated as a Mayer–Vietoris axiom: for any CW complex &quot;W&quot; covered by two subcomplexes &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, and any elements &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;U&quot;), &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) such that &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; restrict to the same element of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;V&quot;), there is an element &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;(&quot;W&quot;) restricting to &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, respectively.
Then &quot;F&quot; is representable by some CW complex &quot;C&quot;, that is to say there is an isomorphism 
:&quot;F&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;) ≅ &quot;Hom&quot;&quot;Hotc&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;C&quot;)
for any CW complex &quot;Z&quot;, which is natural in &quot;Z&quot; in that for any morphism from &quot;Z&quot; to another CW complex &quot;Y&quot; the induced maps &quot;F&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;) and &quot;Hom&quot;&quot;Hot&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) → &quot;Hom&quot;&quot;Hot&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) are compatible with these isomorphisms.

The converse statement also holds: any functor represented by a CW complex satisfies the above two properties. This direction is an immediate consequence of basic category theory, so the deeper and more interesting part of the equivalence is the other implication.

The representing object &quot;C&quot; above can be shown to depend functorially on &quot;F&quot;: any natural transformation from &quot;F&quot; to another functor satisfying the conditions of the theorem necessarily induces a map of the representing objects. This is a consequence of Yoneda&#x27;s lemma.

Taking &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) to be the singular cohomology group &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) with coefficients in a given abelian group &quot;A&quot;, for fixed &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0; then the representing space for &quot;F&quot; is the Eilenberg–MacLane space &quot;K&quot;(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;i&quot;). This gives a means of showing the existence of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces.

==Variants==

Since the homotopy category of CW-complexes is equivalent to the localization of the category of all topological spaces at the weak homotopy equivalences, the theorem can equivalently be stated for functors on a category defined in this way.

However, the theorem is false without the restriction to &quot;connected&quot; pointed spaces, and an analogous statement for unpointed spaces is also false.

A similar statement does, however, hold for spectra instead of CW complexes. Brown also proved a general categorical version of the representability theorem, which includes both the version for pointed connected CW complexes and the version for spectra.

A version of the representability theorem in the case of triangulated categories is due to Amnon Neeman. Together with the preceding remark, it gives a criterion for a (covariant) functor &quot;F&quot;: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; between triangulated categories satisfying certain technical conditions to have a right adjoint functor. Namely, if &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are triangulated categories with &quot;C&quot; compactly generated and &quot;F&quot; a triangulated functor commuting with arbitrary direct sums, then &quot;F&quot; is a left adjoint. Neeman has applied this to proving the Grothendieck duality theorem in algebraic geometry.

Jacob Lurie has proved a version of the Brown representability theorem for the homotopy category of a pointed quasicategory with a compact set of generators which are cogroup objects in the homotopy category. For instance, this applies to the homotopy category of pointed connected CW complexes, as well as to the unbounded derived category of a Grothendieck abelian category (in view of Lurie&#x27;s higher-categorical refinement of the derived category).

<text>Jon Hensley (born August 26, 1965, in Browns Mills, New Jersey) is an American actor, singer and songwriter, best recognized for his portrayal of Holden Snyder on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, a role he held from 1985 until the series finale on September 17, 2010. He later portrayed Dr. Meade on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; from 2012 to 2013.

== Career ==

Hensley&#x27;s first television role was in 1985 on the daytime drama &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Brody Price. That role was short-term, but led to Hensley being cast in the role for which he is best known, the role of rebellious farmhand Holden Snyder on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

Hensley started on the series in 1985, and became a popular player when the character of Holden and his &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot; love affair with rich Lily Walsh (Martha Byrne) set the stage for much story in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Hensley ended his first stint in 1988. During his first break from the show, Hensley studied at the National Shakespeare Conservatory 8-week summer session in Kerhonkson, New York, in 1989.

Hensley returned to the series in 1990 and continued on until 1995. He returned again in 1997, where his character eventually resumed his relationship with Lily. The couple is considered to have reached &quot;supercouple&quot; status and are recognized as one of the serial&#x27;s most recognized supercouples.

Outside of daytime, Hensley has starred in the USA Network television movie &quot;Wounded Heart&quot;, and made appearances on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and &quot;Almost Perfect&quot;.

Hensley returned to daytime in May 2012 in the recurring role of Dr. Meade on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Hensley met co-star Kelley Menighan, who portrayed the role of Emily Stewart on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, and the couple were married on May 25, 1996. They have three children, two daughters and a son. In 2015, Hensley and Menighan were divorced.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Hensley was a resident of Old Tappan, New Jersey.

<text>Mike Smartt OBE is a British journalist and broadcaster, and was the founder and editor-in-chief of BBC News Online, the BBC&#x27;s Internet news service. With Project Director Bob Eggington, he led the team that launched the service in 1997, and held the post of editor-in-chief of BBC News Interactive, which also encompassed interactive television news, until 2004. During this time, News Online won all four interactive news BAFTA awards (the category was scrapped after the fourth win) and most of the world&#x27;s online news prizes, including the US-based so-called Webby &quot;internet Oscars&quot; on a number of occasions.

Originally, many had doubts about the feasibility of the web service, including Smartt&#x27;s friend and BBC World Editor John Simpson, who described the project as sounding &quot;quite nerdy&quot;. Later Simpson conceded that News Online had become one of the main outlets for his work. At the 2003 European Online Journalism Awards, Smartt received an award for outstanding contribution to online journalism in Europe, and in 2004 he was appointed an OBE for services to broadcasting.

Before being placed in editorial charge of the launch of the online service, he was, for 20 years, a correspondent for BBC Television News covering major news stories at home and abroad. He was also, during the late-1980s, a main co-presenter on the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and the &quot;BBC Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and an occasional presenter of all the other BBC News output on TV.

Mike started his career at the Corporation at &quot;BBC Radio Humberside&quot; in the early 1970s as a News Producer and very occasional rock music DJ, following some years learning the craft of journalism on newspapers. During the late 1970s and early 1980s he was the BBC&#x27;s staff reporter and a presenter of BBC North&#x27;s (Leeds) regional TV news programme, &quot;Look North&quot;.

Smartt, who spent more than 30 years at the BBC, was succeeded by Pete Clifton at News Interactive. He now consults, lectures and writes about journalism and interactive news and is also editor-in-chief of World Press Photos Online magazine Enter.

<text>Fifehead Magdalen is a small village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It lies within the Blackmore Vale, about south-southwest of Gillingham and west of Shaftesbury. It is sited on Corallian limestone soil and surrounded by Oxford Clay, about from the west bank of the River Stour. Its name means &quot;the place of five hides dedicated to [St] Magdalene&quot;. In 2013 the estimated population of the parish was 80. The village was a venue for stave dances.

==Parish Church of St. Mary Magdalene==
The Parish Church, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene after whom the village is named, dates mostly from the 14th century. However its most striking feature is the small &quot;Newman chapel&quot; built onto the north side of the nave sometime around 1693. It is believed to cover a vault containing the mortal remains of several members of the Newman family who were Lords there for many centuries. At first the family leased the Fifehead Tudor manor house from the Abbey of St Augustine&#x27;s of Bristol, perhaps since 1408, but then bought the estate in the early 15th century. The chapel was almost certainly commissioned by Col. Richard Newman (1620–1695) whose father Richard (1584–1664) and grandfather Thomas (d.1649) are memorialised on plaques mounted on the chapel&#x27;s east wall, and whose son Richard (1650–1682) who predeceased him, is memorialised on the west wall.

On the north wall of the chapel is a later and much larger monument to Richard&#x27;s grandson Sir Richard Newman of Fifehead, Preston Hall and Evercreech (1676–1721), his wife Frances, his son Sir Samwell Newman (c.1696–1747) and three daughters, Frances, Barbara and Elizabeth. This magnificent monument was created by the famous Westminster sculptor Sir Henry Cheere and dates from between 1747 (when Sir Samwell Newman died) and 1763 (when his sister Barbara died).

In the churchyard, nearby the entrance gate, is the tombstone of Thomas Newman who died in April 1668, believed to be the great-uncle of Sir Richard Newman.

<text>Arnon Yasha Yves Grünberg (; born 22 February 1971) is a Dutch writer of novels, essays, and columns, as well as a journalist. He published some of his work under the heteronym Marek van der Jagt. He lives in New York. His work has been translated into 30 languages. In 2022 he received the PC Hooftprijs, a Dutch literary lifetime achievement award. His most acclaimed and successful novels are Blue Mondays and Tirza. The New York Times called the latter ‘grimly comic and unflinching (…) while not always enjoyable, it is never less than enthralling’. &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; described him as ‘the Dutch Philip Roth’.

==Early life==
Grunberg was born Arnon Yasha Yves Grünberg on 22 February 1971 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He grew up in a family of Jewish immigrants, originally from Germany. His mother was a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Grunberg attended the Vossius Gymnasium in Amsterdam, but was expelled from the school in 1988. Before publishing his first novel, he held various odd jobs, and tried his hand at acting in a short film by Dutch avant-garde film maker Cyrus Frisch. From 1990 to 1993, Grunberg ran his own publishing house, Kasimir, which was financially unsuccessful.

==Novels==
Grunberg made his literary debut in 1994 with the novel &quot;Blue Mondays (Blauwe maandagen&quot;), which won the Anton Wachter Prize for best debut novel. Critics hailed it as a &quot;grotesque comedy, a rarity in Dutch literature.&quot; In 2000, he was the first to win this debut prize again, but this time under his heteronym Marek van der Jagt, for the novel &quot;The Story of My Baldness (De geschiedenis van mijn kaalheid)&quot;.

The much-acclaimed novel &quot;Tirza&quot;, about a father&#x27;s obsessive love for his graduating daughter, was Grunberg&#x27;s first novel to be made into a movie, Tirza, in 2010, after winning the Dutch Libris Prize and the Belgian Golden Owl in 2007. This book has been translated into fourteen languages and has received critical acclaim in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times &quot;and &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, among others. A 2010 national poll of literary critics, academics and writers held by the magazine &quot;De Groene Amsterdammer&quot; elected &quot;Tirza&quot; as the &quot;most important novel of the 21st century,&quot; over Jonathan Littell&#x27;s &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot; and Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Saturday&quot;. In 2009, Grunberg won the Constantijn Huygens Prize for his entire body of work and in 2011 he received the Frans Kellendonk-prijs.

In September 2008, Grunberg published his seventh novel, &quot;Onze Oom&quot; (&quot;Our Uncle&quot;). The story is about a girl who is like a dead person among the living and a major who tries to overcome his shame by leading an insurgent army. Grunberg incorporated his experiences in the army in Afghanistan into this book. Since then, Grunberg has published various novels, including &quot;Skin and Hair&quot; in 2010 (&quot;Huid en Haar&quot;), &quot;The Man without Illness&quot; (&quot;De Man Zonder Ziekte&quot;) in 2012 and &quot;Birthmarks&quot; (&quot;Moedervlekken&quot;) in 2016, which were translated into French and German, among other languages. These books also received considerable acclaim. &quot;Le Monde&quot; called The Man without Illness &#x27;a wonderful gateway to the work of Arnon Grunberg, [who is] one of the most fascinating writers of his generation&#x27;. His work is also available in Portugal, Hungary, Israel, Turkey and Brazil.

== Journalism and essays ==
In addition to his many novels, he has written newspaper and magazine columns, essays, poetry, scenarios and plays. Through his essays, opinion articles and lectures, Arnon Grunberg has made a major contribution to the public debate in international media about issues such as migration policy, discrimination, racism and human trafficking. His essays have appeared in The New York Times, Le Monde, Liberération, The Times, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Courrier International, Revista Contexto and Süddeutsche Zeitung.

Grunberg is also known for his literary journalism and periods of complete immersion into diverse aspects of society. He has been embedded with Dutch troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, and visited Guantánamo Bay. He has spent time with and written about masseurs at a Romanian resort, patients in a Belgian psychiatric ward, dining-car waiters on a Swiss train, and an ordinary Dutch family on vacation. In 2009 his reports were published in a book called &quot;Chambermaids and Soldiers (Kamermeisjes en Soldaten)&quot;, followed by &quot;Slaughters and Psychiatrists (Slachters en Psychiaters)&quot; in 2021. The latter contains his reports from 2009 until 2020. Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant praised the book: “Grunberg can not only sketch an unknown world with a few sharp strokes of the pen, but also bring it to vivid life.&quot;

Grunberg states he writes because he wants to know ‘how people do something like living their life’: &quot;Everything is field research: friendship, sex, love, and work. It is only by writing about it that you can escape from it.&quot;

== Academic and scientific research ==
In 2008 Grunberg became a writer-in-residence and guest lecturer at the Leiden University and Wageningen University and Research Centre. In October 2014, he became an honorary fellow at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Amsterdam. His lectures focused on issues related to privacy and surveillance, and together with his students, he developed a video game. The lecture series coincided with an exhibit on the author&#x27;s life and work, the materials for which were sourced from his literary archives, which were on loan to the university library&#x27;s Special Collections department, making them a unique, &quot;living&quot; archive.
In an attempt to understand the creative process, Grunberg wrote his latest novel &quot;Het Bestand&quot; (which, in Dutch, can refer to both a computer file and a truce) while scientists were measuring his brain activity, emotions, and subjective feelings. Using screen capture and physiological measurements such as EEG, GSR and ECG, and subjective questionnaires for the author, scientists correlated the writing of emotionally charged passages with physiological activity. The second stage of the experiment took place in October and November 2015 in the GrunbergLab at the University of Amsterdam, where volunteers&#x27; brain activity was measured while they were reading the novel in a controlled environment.

<doc id="1073769" wikidata="Q938711" url="?curid=1073769" title="Diplomatic corps">
<text>The diplomatic corps () is the collective body of foreign diplomats accredited to a particular country or body.

The diplomatic corps may, in certain contexts, refer to the collection of accredited heads of mission (ambassadors, high commissioners, nuncios and others) who represent their countries in another state or country. As a body, they usually only assemble to attend state functions like a coronation, inauguration, national day or State Opening of Parliament, depending on local custom. They may also assemble in the royal or presidential palace to give their own head of state&#x27;s New Year greeting to the head of state of the country in which they are based.

The term is sometimes confused with the collective body of diplomats &quot;from&quot; a particular country—the proper term for which is &quot;diplomatic service&quot;. The diplomatic corps is not always given any formal recognition by its host country, but can be referenced by official orders of precedence.

In many countries, and especially in Africa, the heads and the foreign members of the country offices of major international organizations (United Nations agencies, the European Union, the International Committee of the Red Cross, agencies of the African Union, etc.) are considered members—and granted the rights and privileges—of the diplomatic corps.

Diplomatic vehicles in most countries have distinctive diplomatic license plates, often with the prefix or suffix &quot;CD&quot;, the abbreviation for the French &quot;corps diplomatique&quot;.

==Doyen of the Diplomatic Corps==

In most countries, the longest-serving ambassador to a country is given the title Doyen of the Diplomatic Corps (). The doyen is often accorded a high position in the order of precedence. In New Zealand, for example, the doyen takes precedence over figures such as the deputy prime minister and former governors-general.

In many countries that have Catholicism as the official or dominant religion, the &quot;apostolic nuncio&quot; (the diplomatic representative of the Holy See) serves as doyen by virtue of his office, regardless of seniority; in other cases, the nuncio is treated as an ordinary ambassador of the Holy See and has no special precedence. The Congress of Vienna and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provided that any country may choose to give nuncios a different precedence than other ambassadors.

The diplomatic corps may also cooperate amongst themselves on a number of matters, including certain dealings with the host government. In practical terms, the doyen of the diplomatic corps may have a role to play in negotiating with local authorities regarding the application of aspects of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and diplomatic immunity, such as the payment of certain fees or taxes, since the receiving country is required &quot;not to discriminate between states&quot;. In this sense, the doyen has the role of representing the entire diplomatic corps for matters that affect the corps as a whole, although this function is rarely formalized.

<doc id="1073770" wikidata="Q178146" url="?curid=1073770" title="Nolle prosequi">
<text>, abbreviated or , is legal Latin meaning &quot;to be unwilling to pursue&quot;. It is a type of prosecutorial discretion in common law, used for prosecutors&#x27; declarations that they are voluntarily ending a criminal case before trial or before a verdict is rendered; it is a kind of motion to dismiss and contrasts with an involuntary dismissal.

==Application in United States law==
&quot;Nolle prosequi&quot; as a declaration is most often used in criminal cases, but in jurisdictions making use of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; in civil lawsuits, it is used by a plaintiff that voluntarily drops its claims. In civil cases, a retraxit or a motion for voluntary dismissal may be made by a plaintiff instead of a declaration of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;, depending upon the custom and rules of a given jurisdiction.

=== Decision-maker ===
&quot;Nolle prosequi&quot; as a declaration can be made by a prosecutor in a criminal case either before or during trial, resulting in the prosecutor declining to further pursue the case against the defendant. Courts seldom challenge applications for &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;. In the United States, judges will usually sign a dismissal order prepared by the prosecution or make a docket entry indicating the disposition of the case to be &quot;nolle prosse&quot; after a declaration or motion by the prosecution.

In criminal cases in the United States, it has been held improper for a court to enter an order of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; on its own, without a motion by the prosecutor, but as to sentencing discrepancies involved in a sentence recommendation, a trial judge is authorized to reject an underlying guilty plea based upon concerns of fairness and justice or because it is presented after the plea cutoff date. The notes to Rule 48 of the US Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCRP) draw attention to the effect of the rule as contrasting with common law. Rule 48 now mandates that prosecutors seek leave of the court before they dismiss a case via filing a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;.

=== Reason ===
The declaration may be made because the charges cannot be proved because vital witnesses have become unavailable or uncooperative, the evidence is too weak to carry the burden of proof, the evidence is fatally flawed in light of the claims that are brought, the prosecutor becomes doubtful that the defendant is guilty, the defendant&#x27;s innocence is proven, the defendant has entered into an arrangement to advance the prosecuting entity&#x27;s political agenda, or the defendant has died. It has also been used when a federal criminal charge is brought up against a defendant when the prosecutor on a state charge for the same offense no longer wishes to pursue the case. Usually, that happens when the state prosecutor is content with the sentence on the federal charge and has no need to go any further with the original case.

=== Timing ===
In criminal cases, &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; declarations are made generally after an indictment as long as adjudication on the merits has not occurred or, in some jurisdictions, as long as a trial has not commenced. In civil cases, &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; declarations are made either before the trial begins or before a judgment on the merits is rendered, depending on the rules of the jurisdiction.

=== Legal effect ===
The entry of a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; is not an acquittal. Since the principle of double jeopardy therefore does not apply, the defendant may later be indicted on the same charge again.

=== Application in civil cases ===
In civil cases, a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; or voluntary dismissal may be entered as to one of several counts or claims, or as to one of several defendants, or both. In any jurisdiction, whether a motion for voluntary dismissal or a declaration of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; is used, federal and state rules of civil procedure generally govern when, how, and why claims may be voluntarily dismissed and apply different rules to different types of claims and to whether a court may give leave to dismiss a matter with or without prejudice.

=== Similarity to a declination of prosecution ===
&quot;Nolle prosequi&quot; is similar to a declination of prosecution, which is an agreement not to prosecute made before any charges are brought or suit has been filed. A declination of prosecution may be made by an attorney or may be made as an agreement between the aggrieved party and the claimant.

In contrast, &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; is usually made after a decision to prosecute has already been made. A declination of prosecution may be made for many reasons, such as weak evidence or a conflict of interest.

== Application and legal effect in English law ==
The power of entering a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; is now rarely used, mostly in cases where a defendant is permanently physically or mentally unfit to appear in court, or when an ordinary member of the public has brought private criminal proceedings which the Attorney General considers it is not in the public interest to continue. In practice, where a prosecution is not to be taken forward due to flaws identified in the evidence or the prosecution no longer being in the public interest, the prosecutor will generally offer no evidence and the court will acquit the defendant.

In the past, a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; was also used to protect a person who was given immunity from prosecution. A &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; acts as an indefinite adjournment to the case, not an acquittal. While terminating the proceedings, it does not bar the defendant from being indicted again, but there is no known case of this happening in the century before 1957, or since.

However, in the Al-Yamamah arms deal, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office was pressured by the Attorney General to terminate an investigation into a claim that BAE Systems had bribed
influential persons in Saudi Arabia to secure a profitable defence contract. Although initial pressure from BAE on the grounds of economic damage and the disruption of friendly relations with Saudi Arabia was resisted both by the Director and the Attorney General, further pressure from the Prime Minister, under pressure from the Saudi government which threatened to end co-operation against terrorism, resulted in the Director agreeing to halt the investigation. The Director&#x27;s decision was challenged by several public interest organisations, and their challenge succeeded in the Divisional Court but failed in the House of Lords on the basis that the Director would have known that the Attorney General could stop any prosecution agreed to by the Director by entering a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;, and so his decision not to prosecute was reasonable and lawful.

=== Decision-maker and timing ===
Only the attorney general can enter a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;, acting in the public interest. The attorney general is not answerable to the courts but to Parliament for how this power is exercised. It can be entered at any stage after an indictment has been signed and before a Crown Court judgment is made. A &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; will usually be requested from the attorney general by the defence but an application can also be made by the prosecution.

==&quot;Nolle prosequi&quot; in other jurisdictions==

===Canada===
The equivalent power in Canada is a Crown-directed stay of charges. This causes the prosecution to be suspended for a period of one year before an outright dismissal; in practice stayed prosecutions are almost never recommenced.

=== Ireland ===
The power of entering a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; in the Republic of Ireland rests with the Director of Public Prosecutions, and its use is normally in cases where there are problems with the evidence that would make it difficult for the case to proceed. The director may in theory pursue the prosecution later, but this rarely, if ever, happens. As the accused enjoys the presumption of innocence that all accused people enjoy until they are convicted, an entry of a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; is equated with innocence. This power is quite widely used: 376 cases of rape, about one-quarter of the total of indictments for this offence, were ended by an entry of a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; in 2013.

=== Australia===
Although there are differences in practice between the different states and territories, the attorney-general, solicitor-general or designated law officer in each may enter a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;, with the effects that the indictment is not proceeded with and the accused person is discharged. Although the general practice is not to revive the proceedings, this may be done if important new evidence comes to light or where it is in the interests of justice to do so. It is not uncommon for a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; to be entered because the evidence available to the prosecution is often not reviewed by senior prosecuting counsel, and found to be inadequate a few days before the trial date, or a witness refuses to testify.

Attempts by the prosecution to enter a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; in order to avoid a trial which has started from reaching its conclusion, for example, where a jury may have signalled their likely verdict, where the case has gone badly for the prosecution or where the prosecutor has proceeded without an unavailable witness, have been regarded by the Australian courts as an abuse of process, as the prosecution may hope to reinstate the charges before a different jury or with the missing witness. This rule applies even if entering the &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; was not challenged when it was done. A number of other cases have been brought before the Australian courts, claiming that the reinstatement of charges after entry of a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; is an abuse of process in other circumstances. None has succeeded, as the relevant circumstances did not constitute abuse, but the appellate court stated that there could be case where making a charge following the entering of a &quot;nolle&quot; could be oppressive and so an abuse of the court process.

===India===
In India this power is guided by Section 321 of Criminal Procedure Code which enables the public prosecutor or the assistant public prosecutor to withdraw from the prosecution of any person either generally or in respect of any one or more of the offences for which he is tried. For doing so, consent of the court is necessary.

===Nigeria===
An attorney-general is the chief law officer both of the Federation of Nigeria and of each Nigerian state, and is also a government minister there. Under the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, the federal attorney-general has powers to institute or to take over and continue any criminal proceedings, and to discontinue them at any stage before a final judgement is delivered. The last power gives statutory authority to the practice of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;, which has existed in Nigeria since the colonial era. It is not necessary for the attorney-general to ask for the consent of the court hearing the case, as was confirmed by the Federal Appeal Court in 1981. During the Second Nigerian Republic of 1979–1983, the state attorneys-general also had the power to issue a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;, and abused this power in a few notorious cases, but this power is now only available to the federal attorney-general.

===Ghana===
The Attorney-General of Ghana has statutory power to issue a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; under the Ghanaian Criminal Procedure Code of 1960, which acts to discontinue any criminal proceedings before a final judgement is made. A &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; was issued in several cases in 2001, when criminal libel cases brought against several journalists by one political party when in power were discontinued after a change of government. A number of cases have been brought on whether there are any restrictions on the attorney-general&#x27;s discretion when issuing a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;. These have concluded that &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; terminates a case in favour of the accused, without preventing new proceedings being issued later, and that the attorney general is answerable neither to the court in which the case was discontinued nor to any appellate court. However, these cases predate the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, which gives the Supreme Court oversight of any discretionary power vested in any person, although no case has been brought against any Attorney-General of Ghana for failure to use his discretion fairly, despite claims of political bias in the use of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is responsible for bringing criminal prosecutions on behalf of the state. In cases where the NPA decides not to proceed with a prosecution, a private individual with a direct interest may in terms of Section 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act bring a private criminal prosecution against an individual. The private prosecutor must first apply for a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; from the Director of Public Prosecutions (to confirm that the State does not intend to proceed with a trial), and bring the private prosecution within three months.

== Notable cases and other references ==

* The prosecution of Jefferson Davis for treason was dropped in 1868 after a declaration of general amnesty by President Andrew Johnson.
* The trial of the prime suspect for the 1902 Peasenhall murder in Suffolk in England was stopped by the Attorney General after two juries failed to reach a verdict.
* In 1924, Connecticut prosecutor Homer Stille Cummings dismissed charges against Harold Israel, a vagrant accused of murdering a popular priest in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Cummings destroyed the evidence his own office had compiled against Israel in a 90-minute courtroom presentation. The case became the basis of the 1947 film &quot;Boomerang!&quot;
* In 1925, prosecutors elected to dismiss murder charges against the remaining ten defendants in the case of &quot;People vs. Ossian Sweet&quot;. It involved a black family that had defended its home against a white mob. They were defended by attorney Clarence Darrow, who was retained by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The trial was presided over by Detroit Recorder&#x27;s Court Judge Frank Murphy, who went on to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. After an initial mistrial, Henry Sweet (Ossian&#x27;s brother, who admitted he fired the shot) was acquitted by a jury on grounds of self-defense; the dismissals of the charges against the ten remaining defendants followed.
* In 1957, John Bodkin Adams, who worked in Eastbourne, England, was tried for the murder of an elderly widow, Edith Alice Morrell and indicted, but not tried for the murder of another widow, Gertrude Hullett. When he was found not guilty of killing the former, Attorney-General Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller controversially entered a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; regarding the latter charge. The trial judge, Mr Justice Devlin, in his post-trial book commented: &quot;The use of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; to conceal the deficiencies of the prosecution was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all.&quot;
* The Bertie Wooster character in the Jeeves novels by P. G. Wodehouse frequently enters a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; when refusing to do something another character is asking him to do.
* In 1982, a prosecution concerning the play &quot;The Romans in Britain&quot; by Howard Brenton collapsed after it was demonstrated that what a witness had thought was an erect penis shown on stage during a male rape scene was in fact an actor&#x27;s thumb. The case had been brought at the urging of the morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who had not seen the play; it was ended with a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;.
* In 2004, rape charges against basketball player Kobe Bryant were dropped after the complainant refused to testify.
* In 2011, as a result of his death, charges against Osama bin Laden were dropped with the filing of a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; in a Manhattan federal court by the U.S. Department of Justice.
* In 2019, subsequent to the Boston straight pride parade, a justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that a notice of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; could not be denied by a judge. Notice of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; was found to be within the prosecutor&#x27;s right to exercise judgment and manage limited resources. &quot;[The trial court judge&#x27;s] effort to do so violated the Commonwealth&#x27;s constitutional rights.&quot;
* While on trial for corruption in September 2022, former South African president Jacob Zuma brought a private prosecution against the state prosecutor in his corruption trial, Billy Downer, and a journalist covering the case, Karyn Maughan. Zuma accused Downer of leaking private information to Maughan, a charge which both denied as they said the information was in the public domain. Zuma received a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; as the Director of Public Prosecutions did not believe an offence had been committed. Both Downer and Maughan applied to High Court for the case to be dismissed before trial. In December 2022, Zuma relied on the same &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; to bring a private prosecution against his successor Cyril Ramaphosa, accusing him of being an accessory after the fact to Downer and Maughan&#x27;s alleged actions. The status of this &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; was contested as there was a dispute whether a &quot;nolle prosqui&quot; obtained in one case could be applied to another. In January 2023, the Johannesburg High Court stayed the prosecution of Ramaphosa until a later date when a court could consider the validity of the &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; and other issues raised by Ramaphosa.

<text>Anton Johannes Gerrit Corbijn van Willenswaard (; born 20 May 1955) is a Dutch photographer, film director, and music video director. He is the creative director behind the visual output of Depeche Mode and U2, having handled the principal promotion and sleeve photography for both bands over three decades. His music videos include Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; (1990), U2&#x27;s &quot;One&quot; (version 1) (1991), Bryan Adams&#x27; &quot;Do I Have to Say the Words?&quot;, Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; (1993), Travis&#x27;s &quot;Re-Offender&quot; (2003) and Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Talk&quot; (2005). He directed the films &quot;Viva la Vida&quot; (2008); the Ian Curtis biographical film &quot;Control&quot; (2007), &quot;The American&quot; (2010); &quot;A Most Wanted Man&quot; (2014), based on John le Carré&#x27;s 2008 novel of the same name; and &quot;Life&quot; (2015), after the friendship between &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer Dennis Stock and James Dean.

==Early life and family==
Anton Johannes Gerrit Corbijn van Willenswaard was born on 20 May 1955 in Strijen in the Netherlands, where his father had been appointed as parson to the Dutch Reformed Church the previous year. His father, Anton Corbijn van Willenswaard (1917–2007), took up the same position in Hoogland (1966) and Groningen (1972), moving his wife and four children with him. His mother, Marietje Groeneboer (1925–2011), was a nurse and was raised in a parson&#x27;s family. Photographer and director Maarten Corbijn (born 1960) is a younger brother. Grandfather Anton Johannes (Corbijn) van Willenswaard (1886–1959) was an art teacher at Christian schools in Hilversum and an active member in the local Dutch Reformed Church in Hilversum.

==Photography==
Corbijn began his career as a music photographer when he saw the Dutch musician Herman Brood playing in a café in Groningen around 1975. He took a lot of photographs of the band Herman Brood &amp; His Wild Romance and these led to a rise in fame for Brood and in exposure for Corbijn.

From the late 1970s the London-based &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME), a weekly music paper, featured his work on a regular basis and would often have a photograph by him on the front page. One such occasion was a portrait of David Bowie wearing a loincloth backstage in New York when starring in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. In the early years of London-based &quot;The Face&quot;, a glossy monthly post-punk life style / music magazine, Corbijn was a regular contributor. He made his name photographing in black-and-white but in May 1989 he began taking pictures in colour using filters. His first venture in this medium was for Siouxsie Sioux. Between 1998 and 2000, in collaboration with the painter Marlene Dumas, he worked on a project called &quot;Stripping Girls&quot;, which took the strip clubs and peep shows of Amsterdam as their subject; while Corbijn later exhibited photographs, Dumas took Polaroids which she then used as sources for her paintings.

Corbijn has photographed Jimmy Page and Robert Plant (formerly of Led Zeppelin), Ai Weiwei, Bob Dylan, Joy Division, Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Prāta Vētra, Peter Hammill, Miles Davis, Kate Bush, Björk, Captain Beefheart, Kim Wilde, Marc Almond, Robert De Niro, Stephen Hawking, Elvis Costello, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Morrissey, Peter Murphy, Simple Minds, Clint Eastwood, The Cramps, Roxette, Herbert Grönemeyer, Annie Lennox, and Eurythmics, amongst others. Perhaps his most famous and longest standing associations are with Depeche Mode and U2. Corbijn&#x27;s work relationship with Depeche Mode began with the filming of a music video for their 1986 single &quot;A Question of Time&quot;. Corbijn says that he soon &quot;started to realise that [his] visuals and their music went really well together. Then [he] did some live photos, and it eventually turned into designing the whole live set. That&#x27;s what [he&#x27;s] been doing for them since 1993.&quot; Corbijn has directed over 20 of the band&#x27;s music videos, the most recent of his works being 2024&#x27;s &quot;Before We Drown&quot;. He has also designed most of the covers for Depeche Mode&#x27;s albums and singles from 1990&#x27;s &quot;Violator&quot; album and onwards. Corbijn&#x27;s work with U2 includes taking pictures of the band on their first US tour, taking pictures for their albums &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, and directing a number of accompanying videos.

Other album covers featuring work by Corbijn include those for Springsteen, Nick Cave, Siouxsie&#x27;s second band The Creatures, Bryan Adams, Metallica, Therapy?, The Rolling Stones, Bon Jovi, The Killers, Simple Minds, R.E.M., The Bee Gees, Saybia, Clannad and Moke.

==Film directing==

Corbijn began his music video directing career when Palais Schaumburg asked him to direct a video. After seeing the resulting video for &quot;Hockey&quot;, the band Propaganda had Corbijn direct &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot;. After that he directed videos for David Sylvian, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Golden Earring, Front 242, Depeche Mode, Roxette and U2. His first video in colour was made for U2 in 1984 for their single &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;. In 2005 Palm Pictures released a DVD collection of Corbijn&#x27;s music video output as part of the Director&#x27;s Label series.

In 1994 Corbijn directed a short film about Captain Beefheart/Don Van Vliet for the BBC called &quot;Some Yoyo Stuff&quot;. He made his feature film debut with &quot;Control&quot;, a film about the life of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis. It premiered to rave reviews at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2007. The film is based on Deborah Curtis&#x27; book &quot;Touching from a Distance&quot; about her husband and the biography &quot;Torn Apart&quot; by Lindsay Reade (Tony Wilson&#x27;s ex-wife) and Mick Middles. Although shown outside the Palme d&#x27;Or competition, &quot;Control&quot; was the big winner of the Director&#x27;s Fortnight winning the CICAE Art &amp; Essai prize for best film, the &quot;Regards Jeunes&quot; Prize award for best first or second directed feature film and the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film in the sidebar. It also received a special mention for the Caméra d&#x27;Or prize for best debut feature film. In addition, the film also won the Michael Powell award for best new British feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.

In 2010, Corbijn returned as a director with the character-based thriller &quot;The American&quot;, starring George Clooney.

On 26 October 2011, Corbijn directed a webcast by Coldplay from the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas in Madrid, Spain.

His film &quot;A Most Wanted Man&quot; was released in 2014. The John le Carré novel of the same name, which is loosely based on the true War on Terror story of Murat Kurnaz, was set in part in Hamburg, as parts of the film were.

In February 2014, he started filming his next project &quot;Life&quot; about James Dean and photographer Dennis Stock.

On 23 and 25 July 2018, Corbijn filmed the last two concerts of Depeche Mode&#x27;s Global Spirit Tour at the Waldbühne in Berlin. Some of this footage, intertwined with the stories of six life-long fans in the audience, became the film &quot;Spirits in the Forest&quot;, which was released in theaters worldwide on 21 November 2019. In Corbijn&#x27;s interview with &quot;NME&quot; he spoke about the origins behind the idea of this film and said that they (him and Depeche Mode) &quot;decided to look at the reason for why Depeche Mode was still growing... they&#x27;re the biggest cult band in the world. It&#x27;s unbelievable.&quot; He further adds that &quot;it&#x27;s in the DNA of [Depeche Mode] to have these connection to their fans... there&#x27;s something unusual about it and the fans go to great lengths&quot;, which inspired him to make the film in the style that he did.

==Appearances==
Author William Gibson refers to a fictitious portrait by Corbijn of the character Hollis Henry in his 2007 novel &quot;Spook Country&quot;. A Corbijn photograph has served as the author&#x27;s portrait on many of Gibson&#x27;s books, including &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.

Corbijn is the subject of Josh Whiteman&#x27;s 2009 documentary film &quot;Shadow Play: The Making of Anton Corbijn&quot;.

In May 2011, Corbijn presented &quot;Mandela Landscape&quot;, an artwork consisting of Corbijn&#x27;s portrait of Nelson Mandela stitched by Dutch textile artist Berend Strik. Both the original work and 80 signed art prints were sold to fund the international edition of &quot;ZAM Magazine&quot;, an independent platform of African talent.

On 19 December 2011, Corbijn was announced as being on the jury for the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, held in February 2012. At this occasion, the Berlinale Special screened the documentary &quot;Anton Corbijn Inside Out&quot; (directed by Klaartje Quirijns) at the Haus der Berliner Festspiele.

<doc id="1073811" wikidata="Q2551316" url="?curid=1073811" title="Fifehead Neville">
<text>Fifehead Neville is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, situated in the Blackmore Vale about southwest of the town of Sturminster Newton. In the 2011 census the population of the parish was 147.

==Toponymy==
The first part of the name Fifehead Neville derives from the Old English &quot;fīf&quot; and &quot;hīd&quot;, meaning &#x27;(estate of) five hides of land&#x27;. It was recorded as &quot;Fifhide&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The second part derives from the de Neville family who were here in the 13th century; in 1287 the name &quot;Fyfhud Neuyle&quot; was recorded. This differentiated this Fifehead from other Dorset manorial holdings called Fifehead (Fifehead St Quintin and Fifehead St Magdalen).

==History==
In a field bordering the River Divelish the remains of two wings of a Roman villa were found in 1880 and 1903. Floor mosaics and part of a hypocaust system were uncovered. The archaeological findings are on view in the Dorset Museum in Dorchester.

The Domesday Book records that in 1086 the estate of Fifehead Neville had eight households and was part of Pimperne Hundred. The tenant-in-chief of the estate was Waleran the Hunter whose tenant was Ingelrann. The overlordship descended to Walter Walerand (d. 1200–1) and to his daughter and co-heiress Isabel de Waleran who married William de Nevill. The overlordship was inherited by Isabel de Nevill&#x27;s daughter Joan de Nevill (d. 1263), wife of Jordan de St. Martin.

Crossing the Divelish is an old packhorse bridge that has two pointed arches and is probably medieval.

Before 1920 the parish was in two parts, each with its own settlement—Fifehead Neville in the north and Lower Fifehead or Fifehead St Quentin in the south. It is probable each settlement had previously had its own open field system. Fifehead St Quentin (or Fifehead St Quintin) was previously a detached part of Belchalwell, a former parish that is now part of the parish of Okeford Fitzpaine.

==Geography==
Fifehead Neville parish is in the North Dorset administrative district in the Blackmore Vale, sited next to the River Divelish which drains land north of the Dorset Downs around Bulbarrow Hill. The parish, which covers at an elevation of , is also drained by a small tributary of the River Lydden in the west. The underlying geology is mostly Corallian Limestone, with a small amount of Kimmeridge clay in the east and some Oxford clay at Deadmoor Common in the west. Measured directly, Fifehead Neville village is about SW of Sturminster Newton, NNW of Blandford Forum and NNE of the county town, Dorchester.

==Demography==

In the 2011 census Fifehead Neville civil parish had 61 dwellings, 56 households and a population of 147.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2001 is shown in the table below:

In 2013 the estimated population of the parish was 180.

<doc id="1073824" wikidata="Q2043512" url="?curid=1073824" title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">
<text>Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is a type of influenza vaccine in the form of a nasal spray that is recommended for the prevention of influenza.

It is an attenuated live vaccine, unlike other influenza vaccines, which are inactivated vaccines. Live attenuated influenza vaccine is administered intranasally, while inactivated vaccines are administered by intramuscular injection. Live attenuated influenza vaccine is sold under the brand names FluMist and FluMist Quadrivalent in the United States; and the brand name Fluenz Tetra in the European Union. FluMist was first introduced in 2003 by MedImmune.

In the United States, FluMist is approved for self- or caregiver-administration. It is the first influenza vaccine that does not need to be administered by a health care provider.

==Medical uses==
The live attenuated influenza vaccine is used to provide protection against the flu caused by infection with influenza viruses.

==Contraindications==
The use of the live attenuated influenza vaccine is contraindicated, and should therefore not be used, in the following populations:
* children &lt;24 months of age, due to increased risk of wheezing
* individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to previous influenza vaccination.
* individuals with a history of hypersensitivity, especially anaphylactic reactions, to eggs, egg proteins, gentamicin, gelatin, or arginine or to any other ingredient in the formulation 
* People with a medical condition that places them at high risk for complications from influenza, including those with chronic heart or lung disease, such as asthma or reactive airways disease
* People with medical conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure or people with illnesses that weaken the immune system, or who take medications that can weaken the immune system
* Children less than 5 years old with a history of recurrent wheezing
* Children or adolescents receiving aspirin
* People with a history of Guillain–Barré syndrome, a rare disorder of the nervous system
* Pregnant women
* People who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs or who are allergic to any of the nasal spray vaccine components

==Production==
The live attenuated vaccine is based on a flu strain that does not cause disease, that replicates well at relatively cold temperatures (about 25 °C, for incubation purposes), and replicates poorly at body temperature (which minimizes risk to humans). Genes that code for surface proteins (targeted antigens) are combined with this host using genetic reassortment from strains that are projected to be circulating widely in the coming months. The resulting viruses are then incubated in chicken eggs and chick kidney cells. To make the refrigerated version, the virus is purified in centrifuges through a sucrose gradient, then packaged with sucrose, phosphate, glutamate, arginine, and gelatin made from pigs that has been hydrolyzed with acid.

==Risks==
Even though the virus in the live attenuated influenza vaccine is attenuated (low in virulence), it is still a living virus, and may cause an infection with complications in people with weakened immune systems or other underlying medical conditions. The live attenuated influenza vaccine is recommended only for people 2–49 years of age, and people who have a weakened immune system, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic diseases may not be eligible to receive live attenuated influenza vaccine. In contrast, inactivated virus vaccines contain no living virus, and cannot cause a live infection. Persons receiving the live attenuated influenza vaccine may shed small amounts of the vaccine virus during the first week. People coming in contact with the vaccinated person are not considered to be at risk, unless their immune systems are severely weakened (for example, bone marrow transplant recipients) and possible recombination with other (wild or live vaccine) flu strains.

==History==
The live attenuated influenza vaccine was developed by the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor, Michigan and later by Aviron, in Mountain View, California, under the sponsorship of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the 1990s. MedImmune, Inc. purchased Aviron in 2002, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the live attenuated influenza vaccine in June 2003.

The FDA initially approved the live attenuated influenza vaccine only for healthy people aged 5 to 49 because of concerns over possible side effects. The live attenuated influenza vaccine is approved and recommended for healthy children 24 months of age and older. The FDA approved the unfrozen refrigerated version for the same age group (ages 5–49) in August 2006, following completion of phase III clinical trials.

The cold-adapted influenza vaccine version of the vaccine is called CAIV-T, and is stable for storage in a refrigerator, rather than requiring freezer storage as did the originally-approved formulation. Approved for the 2007-2008 flu season, the refrigerated formulation can be distributed more economically, so that the price differential with shots (which had hampered sales of the original frozen version of FluMist) is now largely eliminated. FluMist was initially priced higher than the injectable vaccines, but sold only 500,000 of the four million doses it produced its first year on the market, despite a comparative shortage of flu vaccine in fall 2004. The price was sharply lowered the next year, and the company reported distributing 1.6 million doses in 2005. Because of the price drop, despite selling almost three times as many doses in 2005, the company reported $21 million in FluMist sales, compared to $48 million the previous year.

==Society and culture==

MedImmune is one company that manufactures the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which it sells under the brand name FluMist in the United States, Canada, and Japan, and the brand name Fluenz Tetra in the UK and European Union. For the 2010–2011 flu season, FluMist was the only live attenuated influenza vaccine approved by the FDA for use in the US. All other FDA-approved lots were inactivated virus vaccines. In September 2009, a live attenuated influenza vaccine for the novel H1N1 influenza virus was approved and the seasonal intranasal vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the European Union in 2011. The quadrivalent version was approved for use in the European Union in 2013.

, the only other company holding live attenuated influenza vaccine rights is BioDiem of Australia. BioDiem licensed rights to private production of the vaccine in China to Changchun BCHT Biotechnology, which also holds public rights for production in China sublicensed from the World Health Organization.

It was the first and, , the only live attenuated vaccine for influenza available outside of Europe. In September 2009, a live attenuated influenza vaccine for the novel H1N1 influenza virus was approved. In 2011, the vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the European Union under the brand name Fluenz.

AstraZeneca acquired MedImmune and retired the MedImmune name. In October 2024, Time Magazine named AstraZeneca FluMist (an &quot;at-home nasal vaccine&quot;) as one of the best inventions of 2024.

=== Legal status ===
In May 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Fluenz, intended for the prevention of influenza disease in children and adolescents. The applicant for this medicinal product is AstraZeneca AB.

In September 2024, the US FDA approved FluMist (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal) for self- or caregiver-administration. The FDA granted the approval of FluMist to MedImmune LLC.

==Research==
The live attenuated influenza vaccine is designed to be quickly modifiable to present the surface antigens of seasonal flu. The modifiability could also allow it to be quickly customized as a vaccine against a pandemic influenza if one were to emerge. In light of the global spread of H5N1, ways of reducing human mortality in the event of an H5N1 pandemic have been investigated. Modifying FluMist to serve as a specific human H5N1 vaccine is among the measures studied.

In June 2006, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began enrolling participants in a Phase I H5N1 study of an intranasal influenza vaccine candidate based on MedImmune&#x27;s live, attenuated vaccine technology.

In September 2006, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) reported that inoculation with a live attenuated influenza vaccine modified to present the surface antigens of certain H5N1 variants provided broad protection against other H5N1 variants in the mouse and ferret models. Attenuated live viruses were found protective against H5N1 in mice and chickens in a 2009 study.

&quot;Several trials have reported that live attenuated influenza vaccines can boost virus-specific CTLs as well as mucosal and serum antibodies and provide broad cross-protection against heterologous human influenza A viruses.&quot; (58, 59) &quot;[V]accine formulas inducing heterosubtypic T cell–mediated immunity may confer broad protection against avian and human influenza A viruses.&quot;

<doc id="1073826" wikidata="Q3829610" url="?curid=1073826" title="Legend (TV series)">
<text>Legend is a science fiction Western television series that ran on UPN from April 18, 1995, until August 22, 1995, with one final re-airing of the pilot on July 3, 1996. It starred Richard Dean Anderson and John de Lancie.

== Plot ==
Ernest Pratt, a gambling, womanizing, cowardly, hard-drinking writer has created a dashing literary hero, Nicodemus Legend, the main character in a series of wildly imaginative dime novels set in the untamed West. Because Pratt writes the novels in the first person and has posed as Legend for their cover art, many readers believe that Pratt is Nicodemus Legend.

In the pilot episode, when Pratt learns that Nicodemus Legend has been impersonated and a warrant issued for his arrest, he travels to the scene of the incident to clear the name of his protagonist.

Pratt meets up with the impersonator, a great admirer of his tales, the eccentric European scientist Janos Bartoka Nikola Tesla analogue who had been Thomas Edison&#x27;s research partnerand his brilliant assistant Huitzilopochtli Ramos, who has taken every single course Harvard University had to offer. Bartok &quot;borrowed&quot; the Legend persona in order to help the townspeople of Sheridan, Colorado.

They enlist the reluctant Pratt to their cause, and show him how their scientific expertise and outlandish inventions (frequently based on ideas from Pratt&#x27;s books) can bolster the impression that Pratt really is Nicodemus Legend. Bartok says:
Your celebrity has the power to give our enemies pause. My science can increase that reputation. And together, we will create the real Legend.

Suffering from writer&#x27;s block, under pressure from his publishers, and inspired, in spite of himself, at the thought of doing real good, Pratt reluctantly agrees to assume the persona of his literary creation and to live as the image he created of an adventurous and heroic man. Together, they adventure throughout the West solving mysteries, capturing wrong-doers, and making scientific discoveries.

== Characters ==
=== Main ===
* Ernest Pratt, played by Richard Dean Anderson, was born into a good, conservative Boston family in 1836 and attended Harvard College for a short time, where he fell under the spell of the Romantic poets and Gothic literature. Defying his banker father, Pratt decided to pursue the life of a writer and headed west to San Francisco where he became an apprentice reporter for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. A chance meeting with Mark Twain changed Pratt&#x27;s life and inspired the young man to set to work on his first successful book, &quot;Solitary Knight of the High Plains&quot;, which introduced the dashing hero, Nicodemus Legend. Pratt&#x27;s technique of writing in the first person helps give his readers the impression that Legend&#x27;s exploits are real.
* Nicodemus Legend, also played by Anderson, is the fictional hero of numerous popular novels by Ernest Pratt. Legend is a champion of the underdog, a crusader for justice and truth. His perfect manners, good looks, courage and dedication, and beautiful hand-beaded buckskin outfits make him a dashing and romantic figure. Legend is tough and quick-witted with an impressive knowledge of science. He hates violence, preferring to use brains instead of a gun. In sharp contrast with Pratt, Legend does not drink, smoke, or indulge in sexual activity, although frequently approached by attractive women. Since Pratt&#x27;s novels are written in the first person from Legend&#x27;s point of view, many readers fail to realize that Legend is a fictitious character.
* Janos Bartok, played by John de Lancie, was born in Hungary in 1840. He speaks five languages and is a prodigy in mathematics and electrical engineering. Bartok is fascinated with all aspects of life, from the discovery of new scientific advancements to spiritualism and extra-sensory perception and especially with the idea that man will one day fly. After winning a scholarship to the University of Budapest, Bartok came to New York to work at Western Union where he met the young Thomas Edison. A bitter competition developed between these two brilliant scientists. Eventually, Edison destroyed Bartok&#x27;s reputation by claiming that Bartok had stolen his ideas. Tiring of the scandal and the resulting media attention, Bartok left New York and headed West, settling in Colorado to continue his experiments. His financial backing comes from a wealthy widow in Denver with scientific interests and perhaps other interests in Bartok. In his leisure time he reads the humorous novels of Mark Twain and a series of dime novels which chronicle the adventures of Nicodemus Legend. Janos Bartok was inspired by Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla.

=== Recurring ===
* Huitzilopochtli Ramos, played by Mark Adair Rios, is Mexican, a descendant of Aztec kings who has inherited the great Aztec genius for mathematics. His first name, Huitzilopochtli, means &quot;Hummingbird of the South&quot; and was the name of the chief tribal God in the Aztec religion. Ramos&#x27; brilliance was recognized early in his life, and he eventually went to work for a Harvard archaeologist on a dig in Mexico. The archaeologist was so impressed by Ramos&#x27; intellect that he helped the young man get a scholarship to Harvard. As a running joke, Ramos was described in several different episodes as having a degree in a wide variety of different specialties. The character was a sharp distinction from the cliche image of the mad scientist&#x27;s assistant, as Ramos is fiercely intelligent in his own right. Ramos is fiercely devoted to Bartok, whom he met when they were both working for Western Union. Bartok in turn is unstinting in his praise for Ramos.
* Skeeter, played by Jarrad Paul, is Legend’s version of the Artful Dodger who seems to come from nowhere and live nowhere, but who’s always around and into things.
* Harry Parver, played by Bob Balaban, is the representative of Pratt&#x27;s publisher. He is an Easterner who is fascinated by the West but quite out of place in it. Parver is a businessman surrounded by geniuses, dreamers and lunatics. It is his job to be concerned with deadlines, re-writes and promotional stunts to keep the Legend books at the top of the best-seller lists.

== Episodes ==
==Production==

=== Development ===
&quot;Legend&quot; was originally conceived as a TV movie before it was picked up as a series.

=== Filming ===
It was shot on location in Mescal and Tucson, Arizona, from January to June 1995.

=== Crew ===
* Created by: Michael Piller and Bill Dial
* Executive Producers: Bill Dial, Michael Piller
* Executive Producers: Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Greenburg
* Music by: Ken Harrison

== Broadcast history ==
The series was a Gekko Film Corp production in association with Bill &amp; Mike Productions for Paramount Network Television, broadcast on UPN.

Twelve episodes were aired, including the 2-hour pilot episode. Despite critical praise, this program aired during UPN&#x27;s first year of existence and after a change in network management, along with lower than expected ratings, the show was canceled along with almost every other program aired on the UPN lineup. TV Land aired reruns of all episodes around 1999.

== Other media ==

=== DVD ===
On January 5, 2016, Mill Creek Entertainment released &quot;Legend – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. However, over ten hours of runtime is spread on just two discs, which means a sub-standard bitrate.

=== Novels ===
While no actual &quot;Legend&quot; novels were produced, several titles were referenced in the series, in keeping with the plot device of using gimmicks from Pratt&#x27;s novels.

== Reception ==
Jeff Jarvis of &quot;TV Guide&quot; appreciated the show&#x27;s attempt to follow up &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, as another Western with wry humor, but he ultimately didn&#x27;t recommend it. Jarvis said that while the show is &quot;cute&quot; and that Anderson and de Lancie &quot;click together&quot;, he called the show &quot;dull&quot; when it should be &quot;exciting&quot;. David Bianculli of the Daily News received &quot;Legend&quot; more positively. He liked the two starring actors, and said the Western science-fiction format of the show &quot;provides far more fun, and sly intelligence, than viewers might initially suspect.&quot; Writing in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, John Podhoretz called &quot;Legend&quot; &quot;a gorgeous amalgam of science fiction and old-fashioned Western,&quot; noting it was &quot;eerily similar&quot; to &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; He said the pilot episode was &quot;an engaging piece of work&quot; which was &quot;photographed with stunning care and taste.&quot;

<doc id="1073833" wikidata="Q7954870" url="?curid=1073833" title="WRAS (FM)">
<text>WRAS (88.5 MHz) is a non-commercial FM radio station in Atlanta, Georgia, licensed to Georgia State University. Its schedule is split between college radio format (Album 88) airing from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and public radio programming from Georgia Public Broadcasting (88.5 GPB Atlanta) airing from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. Student programming is funded by GSU&#x27;s Student Activity Fee, while station maintenance is partially funded by GPB. The Album 88 and 88.5 GPB Atlanta formats are both programmed for 24 hours a day, with each available on separate internet streams, and Album 88 is also available full-time on WRAS&#x27;s HD2 subchannel.

The transmitter is located off Interstate 20 on Old Flat Shoals Road Southeast in eastern Atlanta. The Album 88 student studios and offices are located on the campus of Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta, while the GPB studios are located in its headquarters off 14th Street in Midtown Atlanta.

Students at Georgia State host and produce all of the programs on Album 88, with the exception of Georgia State Panthers sporting events. While GPB public radio is heard around the clock on several simulcast radio stations in Georgia, listeners in the Atlanta area only hear the daytime schedule on WRAS. GPB is one of two Atlanta-based National Public Radio affiliate stations; the other is the full-time WABE, with its own news department and programming. The two stations carry overlapping NPR programming, such as &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, and &quot;Morning Edition&quot;.

==Programming==
===Album 88===
In addition to a student management team, Album 88 has over 50 student volunteers who host many of the programs, all of which air on their HD-1 hours (7p-5a). As of 2024, their specialty programming changes as students enroll and graduate each semester and consists of 2-hour blocks. Long-running shows include: &quot;Melodically Challenged&quot; (poetry and alternative music, nationally syndicated), &quot;The Georgia Music Show&quot; (dedicated exclusively to artists from Georgia), &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (female vocalists), &quot;Rhythm &amp; Vibes&quot; (Atlanta&#x27;s longest-running hip hop show), &quot;The Drift&quot; (post rock, emo, and alternative rock), along with newer shows created by current students.

On hours not occupied by specialty programming, and all hours between 5am-7pm, Album 88 features a rotation of curated local and underground music, with emphasis on what&#x27;s been released in the most recent six months. The playlist on rotation includes multiple songs from each included album.

The staff of the radio station has also organized the annual music show called WRASFest, usually spotlighting local and underground talent. It&#x27;s been historically hosted by small or medium-sized venues in Atlanta, like the Masquerade.

===GPB===
On May 6, 2014, Georgia State University announced that WRAS would turn over its daytime hours to a new Atlanta-only service from the radio division of Georgia Public Broadcasting (branded &quot;GPB Atlanta&quot;), with news/talk programming between the hours of 5 a.m. to 7 p.m., leaving the remaining ten hours of the day for student airtime. Daytime programs would continue on Album 88, but accessible only via a new digital subchannel and streaming live on the station&#x27;s website.

GPB paid $150,000 to GSU for the rights to broadcast on WRAS, in addition to a commitment to have GSU communications-major students obtain internships with GPB. GSU was also promised a weekly &quot;Georgia music&quot; program on the GPB state network. The contract was drawn for a two-year period, but it automatically renews, and contains a clause that could theoretically allow for the sharing or transfer of the license to GPB in the future. The student government (SGA) had allocated over $300,000 for the transmitter before finding out that most of its usage would be for GPB instead of for GSU students.

==History==

On January 18, 1971, WRAS first began broadcasting, originally with an effective radiated power of 19,500 watts.

The callsign WRAS was not first on the list of preferred callsigns for the station. The callsign WGSU and a few others were already taken, so WRAS was accepted, standing for &quot;Radio At State.&quot; The first image lines for WRAS were &quot;The Stereo Alternative&quot; and the &quot;Stereo Odyssey,&quot; although most listeners simply referred to the station as &quot;rass.&quot; In 1982 the student general manager at the time changed the image line to &quot;Album 88&quot; and lessened the use of the callsign after seeing Arbitron radio ratings diaries in which listeners regularly confused FM stations WRAS, WRFG and WREK, which were all nearby each other on the radio dial. Album 88 refers to the album-based rotation the format employs: stressing several cuts from each album rather than a single.

Album 88&#x27;s first general manager was Richard Belcher, well known in later years to Atlanta television viewers for his investigative reporting, first on WAGA-TV and later WSB-TV. Alumni of the station span the range of media, from executive positions at the major recording labels and cable networks to air talent at radio and TV stations across the country.

Album 88 has won numerous awards, frequently beating out commercial radio stations, from the former Atlanta weekly &quot;Creative Loafing&quot;, the monthly &quot;Atlanta&quot; magazine, and the former &quot;College Music Journal&quot;. And for a student station with no budget for promotion, the station was also unusually successful, according to the Birch, Arbitron and, more recently, Nielsen ratings. While most student stations in the pre-internet era self-consciously eschewed popularity, WRAS sought to play a wide variety of music while gaining the largest audience possible. The station&#x27;s impact on record sales in Atlanta led to the inclusion of Album 88 as a reporting station to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine for a time in the 1980s. With the increasing number of stations on the FM dial in Atlanta since the 1990s, some commercial stations have increasingly targeted segments of the traditional WRAS audience. Keeping true to its roots, Album 88 today airs a wider variety of music to reflect the much wider range of music genres and sub-genres which have developed in the post-internet era.

Album 88 has played a crucial role in &quot;breaking&quot; a wide range of artists including R.E.M., Deerhunter and Outkast. Several platinum and gold records hang in Album 88&#x27;s studios and offices. According to Bob Geldof, he penned the Boomtown Rats hit song, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; in the Album 88 office after reading a telex report of the schoolyard shooting on which the song is based.

On March 14, 2008, an F-2 tornado struck Atlanta&#x27;s downtown core and led to the evacuation of students and employees from parts of the Georgia State campus. Album 88 was forced to suspend broadcasting for nearly two days. &quot;(See 2008 Atlanta tornado)&quot;

===GPB transfer===
Despite being in the works for years, the signal transfer arrangement with GPB was kept secret until the day after final exams ended, as students were leaving campus for the summer or preparing for graduation, and the station&#x27;s management was making its annual change. GSU and GPB officials claimed that the deal had only been finalized the day before. This made Album 88 staff and GSU students upset at the manner in which it was handled, with some claiming that the transaction may have been illegal. Student anger manifested itself at a protest during GSU&#x27;s spring commencement ceremony, and a social media campaign with the tag #savewras, A petition on change.org drew over 10,000 signatories.

Claims were made that the new daytime programming had the benefit of bringing more NPR news and talk programming to radio listeners in Atlanta. Until the fall of 2015, Atlanta&#x27;s main NPR affiliate, WABE, had long aired classical music during the day between the morning and afternoon &quot;drive time&quot; periods. A number of NPR programs popular elsewhere in the U.S. were not heard in the Atlanta market until WABE launched an all-news stream on its third HD subcarrier; still others were heard on Clark Atlanta University&#x27;s WCLK, an otherwise jazz-formatted station with a weaker signal than WABE. But with WABE&#x27;s move to replace daytime music with informational programs (made in response to the new WRAS programming as perceived competition), much of GPB&#x27;s shows on WRAS began, inadvertently or not, duplicating programming already airing on WABE.

This is the second time that GPB has made use of a student station from a state university. In 2004, WUWG in Carrollton was acquired from the University of West Georgia, its entire broadcast license transferred from UWG to GPB. During the 2000s, the Radio Communications Board of Georgia Tech declined similar overtures made by GPB to its long-running WREK.

Album 88 supporters also raised concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest by Douglass Covey, Vice President for Student Affairs at GSU. Until April 2014, he served on the board of Public Broadcasting Atlanta, the arm of the Atlanta Public Schools that operates WABE and WABE-TV, during the same time GSU was negotiating the deal to bring GPB into competition for listener donations and corporate underwritings that would otherwise go to support WABE.

===Reactions===
 As one of the most influential college radio stations in the nation, support for keeping the Album 88 format on WRAS full-time, with no outside programming, came in from across the country. Efforts to save full-time programming on Album 88 were organized. Some called for a boycott of Georgia Public Broadcasting and its underwriters. In late June, 55 stations in 25 states broadcast a live program in support of Album 88. These efforts, however, were unsuccessful in persuading either GSU or GPB to annul the arrangement.

Album 88 alumni proposed the use of a low-power FM translator for GPB programming in the Atlanta area. Another solution would have been the purchase of a different, presumably commercial, FM station in the Atlanta radio market. But those ideas were rejected. Ultimately, the plan was allowed to go forward, and student programming was relegated to off-time hours on the analog waves.

<text>Carleton County is the name of a former county in Ontario, Canada. In 1969, it was superseded by the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton. In 2001, the Regional Municipality and its eleven local municipalities (including Ottawa) were replaced by the current city of Ottawa.

==History==
Upon the creation of the Johnston District in 1800, Carleton County, named after Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, was created from portions of Dundas and Grenville counties, comprising the following territory:

In 1824, upon the creation of Bathurst District (with its judicial seat at Perth), Carleton was withdrawn from Johnstown District and divided into two counties, so that its constituent townships were distributed as follows:

In 1838, Carleton was withdrawn from Bathurst District to form Dalhousie District, its judicial seat at Bytown, with the following territorial adjustments:

#Pakenham township was transferred to the new Renfrew County
#North Gower and Marlborough townships were added from Johnstown District
#Gloucester and Osgoode townships were added from Ottawa District

Effective January 1, 1850, as a consequence of the passage of the Baldwin Act, Dalhousie District was abolished, and Carleton replaced it for municipal and judicial purposes. It consisted of the following townships:

<text>Eddie Carmel (born Oded Ha-Carmeili, ; March 16, 1936 – August 14, 1972) was an American entertainer, born in British Mandate Palestine (later the State of Israel) with gigantism and subsequent acromegaly resulting from a pituitary adenoma. He was popularly known as &quot;The Jewish Giant&quot;, &quot;The Happy Giant,&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Cowboy.&quot; 

Carmel was listed by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as tall, and billed at the heights of and tall, though he may have more realistically been around tall. He was variously a mutual funds salesman, carnival sideshow act, film actor, rock and roll band singer, and stand-up comedian. He was made famous by photographer Diane Arbus&#x27; picture &quot;Jewish Giant, taken at home with his parents in the Bronx, N.Y. in 1970&quot;, a print of which sold at auction for $421,000 in 2007 ($ in current dollar terms). At the time of his death at age 36, he had shrunk several inches, due to kyphoscoliosis.

== Early life ==
Carmel was born Oded Ha-Carmeili in Jaffa, Mandatory Palestine, to Orthodox Jewish immigrants, weighing 16 pounds, and was Jewish. An only child, he was raised in the Bronx, New York, after his parents Isaac (Itzhak; an insurance salesman born in Poland) and Miriam (née Pines) Ha-Carmeili (born in the United States, and later a secretary at the Jewish Theological Seminary) relocated back to the United States when he was two years old so his mother could care for an ailing relative. His parents were 5 feet 6 inches tall, but his maternal grandfather in Poland was known as the tallest rabbi in the world, at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm). He lived with his parents on Elgar Place in Co-op City in the Bronx.

At 10 years of age Carmel was 6 feet 1 inch tall. At 15 years of age he was 6 feet 6 inches tall, and was diagnosed with gigantism and acromegaly. When he graduated Taft High School in 1954 he was 7 feet tall. He studied at City College of New York for two years where he was elected vice president of his class, majoring in business and joining the Dramatic Club, and Baruch College.

Carmel was listed by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as 9 feet (274 cm) tall, and billed at the heights of 8 ft 9 in (268 cm) and 9 ft 0.625 inches (276 cm) tall, though he may have more realistically been around 7 ft 3 tall. He had a size 24 shoe. He was popularly known as &quot;The Jewish Giant,&quot; &quot;The Happy Giant,&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Cowboy.&quot; 
&quot;Eddie&quot; was his nickname from his youth, and Carmel was a stage surname.

== Career ==
In 1958, Carmel sold mutual funds at an office near Times Square in Manhattan, New York City.

Due to his condition, Carmel&#x27;s primary work was in carnival sideshows, including appearances at Hubert&#x27;s Dime Museum and Flea Circus on West 42nd Street in Times Square, Milt Levine&#x27;s World of Mirth show, and in the 1960s in Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus (which billed him as being 9 feet and 5/8 of an inch tall, and 500 pounds). He also acted in a few films, such as the science fiction horror film &quot;The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot; (1962) and &quot;50,000 B.C. (Before Clothing)&quot; (1963).

He formed and played with a rock and roll band, Frankenstein and the Brain Surgeons. Carmel also recorded two novelty 45 records, &quot;The Happy Giant&quot; and &quot;The Good Monster,&quot; and the single &quot;The Happy Monster&#x27;s Song&quot;.

For a time Carmel, with his best friend, Irwin Sherman, worked together as stand-up comedians in New York. He stopped working in 1969, as his physical condition and arthritis made movement difficult, and he required two canes when he walked, later a wheelchair, and ultimately he was unable to get out of bed.

Carmel was made famous by photographer Diane Arbus&#x27; picture &quot;Jewish Giant, taken at Home with His Parents in the Bronx, N.Y.&quot; in 1970, his back arched against the low ceiling of the apartment where he lived with his parents, when he was 34 years old, two years before his death. As the photo was taken, he joked: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it awful to have midget parents?&quot; Arbus remarked on her photo, &quot;You know how every mother has nightmares when she’s pregnant that her baby will be born a monster? … I think I got that in the mother’s face…&quot; The photo inspired his cousin to make an audio documentary about him in 1999. A print of the photo was sold at auction for $421,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in 2007. A print of the photo was sold at a Christie&#x27;s auction for $583,500 ($ in current dollar terms) in 2017.

==Death==

On August 14, 1972, Carmel died of glandular disease at age 36, in Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York. At the time of his funeral, he had shrunk several inches, due to kyphoscoliosis (curvature of the spine, a mixture of scoliosis and kyphosis).

<doc id="1073845" wikidata="Q40752" url="?curid=1073845" title="Gorgosaurus">
<text>Gorgosaurus ( ; ) is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in western North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (Campanian), between about 76.5 and 75 million years ago. Fossil remains have been found in the Canadian province of Alberta and the U.S. state of Montana. Paleontologists recognize only the type species, &quot;G. libratus&quot;, although other species have been erroneously referred to the genus.

Like most known tyrannosaurids, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; was a large bipedal predator, measuring in length and in body mass. Dozens of large, sharp teeth lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; was most closely related to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, and more distantly related to the larger &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; are extremely similar, distinguished mainly by subtle differences in the teeth and skull bones. Some experts consider &quot;G. libratus&quot; to be a species of &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;; this would make &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; a junior synonym of that genus.

&quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; lived in a lush floodplain environment along the edge of an inland sea. It was an apex predator, preying upon abundant ceratopsids and hadrosaurs. In some areas, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. Although these animals were roughly the same size, there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens. These plentiful remains have allowed scientists to investigate its ontogeny, life history and other aspects of its biology.

== Discovery and naming ==

&quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; was first described by Lawrence Lambe in 1914. Its name is derived from the Greek (&quot;gorgos&quot; – &quot;fierce&quot; or &quot;terrible&quot;) and (&quot;saurus&quot; – &quot;lizard&quot;). The type species is &quot;G. libratus&quot;; the specific epithet &quot;balanced&quot; is the past participle of the Latin verb &quot;librare&quot;, meaning &quot;to balance&quot;.

The holotype of &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; (NMC 2120) is a nearly complete skeleton associated with a skull, discovered in 1913 by Charles M. Sternberg. This specimen was the first tyrannosaurid found with a complete hand. It was found in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and is housed in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. Prospectors from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City were active along the Red Deer River in Alberta at the same time, collecting hundreds of spectacular dinosaur specimens, including four complete &quot;G. libratus&quot; skulls, three of which were associated with skeletons. Matthew and Brown described four of these specimens in 1923.
Matthew and Brown also described a fifth skeleton (AMNH 5664), which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 and sold to their museum. It was smaller than other &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; specimens, with a lower, lighter skull and more elongate limb proportions. Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well. Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, &quot;G. sternbergi&quot;. Today&#x27;s paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile &quot;G. libratus&quot;. Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed in museums across the United States and Canada. &quot;G. libratus&quot; is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from a virtually complete growth series.
In 1856, Joseph Leidy described two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although there was no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name &quot;Deinodon&quot;. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, but in the absence of skeletal remains of &quot;Deinodon&quot;, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a &quot;?Deinodon libratus&quot;. Although &quot;Deinodon&quot; teeth are very similar to those of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. &quot;Deinodon&quot; is usually regarded as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; today. Additional likely synonyms of &quot;G. libratus&quot; and/or &quot;D. horridus&quot; include &quot;Laelaps falculus&quot;, &quot;Laelaps hazenianus&quot;, &quot;Laelaps incrassatus&quot;, and &quot;Dryptosaurus kenabekides&quot;.

Several tyrannosaurid skeletons from the Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana probably belong to &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, although it remains uncertain whether they belong to &quot;G. libratus&quot; or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) at the tip of the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor.

=== Formerly assigned species ===

Several species were incorrectly assigned to &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; in the 20th century. A complete skull of a small tyrannosaurid (CMNH 7541), found in the younger, late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana, was named &quot;Gorgosaurus lancensis&quot; by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1946. This specimen was renamed &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; by Bob Bakker and colleagues in 1988. Currently, many paleontologists regard &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; as a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. Similarly, Evgeny Maleev created the names &quot;Gorgosaurus lancinator&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus novojilovi&quot; for two small tyrannosaurid specimens (PIN 553-1 and PIN 552–2) from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia in 1955. Kenneth Carpenter renamed the smaller specimen &quot;Maleevosaurus novojilovi&quot; in 1992, but both are now considered juveniles of &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot;.

== Description ==
&quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; was smaller than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; or &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, close in size to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;. Adults reached in length from snout to tail, and weighed in body mass. The largest known skull measures long, just slightly smaller than that of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. As in other tyrannosaurids, the skull was large compared to its body size, although chambers within the skull bones and large openings (fenestrae) between bones reduced its weight. &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; share proportionally longer and lower skulls than &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and other tyrannosaurids. The end of the snout was blunt, and the nasal and parietal bones were fused along the midline of the skull, as in all other members of the family. The eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. A tall crest rose from the lacrimal bone in front of each eye, similar to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. Differences in the shape of bones surrounding the brain set &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; apart from &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;.

&quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; teeth were typical of all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth at the front of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and &quot;D&quot;-shaped in cross section. In &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; had 26 to 30 maxillary teeth and 30 to 34 teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of teeth is similar to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; but is fewer than those of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; or &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.
&quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; shared its general body plan with all other tyrannosaurids. Its massive head was perched on the end of an &quot;S&quot;-shaped neck. In contrast to its large head, its forelimbs were very small. The forelimbs had only two digits, although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens, the vestigial remains of the third digit seen in other theropods. &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; had four digits on each hindlimb, including a small first toe (hallux) which did not contact the ground. Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods. The largest known &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; femur measured long. In several smaller specimens of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast-running animals. The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips.

In 2001, paleontologist Phil Currie reported skin impressions from the holotype specimen of &quot;G. libratus&quot;. He originally reported the skin as being essentially smooth and lacking the scales found in other dinosaurs, similar to the secondarily featherless skin found in large modern birds. Scales of some sort were present in this specimen, but they are reportedly widely dispersed from each other and very small. Other patches of isolated &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; skin shows denser, and larger though still relatively fine scales (smaller than hadrosaurid scales and approximately as fine as a Gila monster&#x27;s). Neither of these specimens was associated with any particular bone or specific body area. In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs&quot; Kenneth Carpenter pointed out that traces of skin impressions from the tail of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; showed similar small rounded or hexagonal scales.

== Classification and systematics ==
&quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; is classified in the theropod subfamily Albertosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. It is most closely related to the slightly younger &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;. These are the only two definite albertosaurine genera that have been described, although other undescribed species may exist. &quot;Appalachiosaurus&quot; was described as a basal tyrannosauroid just outside Tyrannosauridae, although American paleontologist Thomas Holtz published a phylogenetic analysis in 2004 which indicated it was an albertosaurine. More recent, unpublished work by Holtz agrees with the original assessment. All other tyrannosaurid genera, including &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, are classified in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. Compared to the tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller, lower skulls and longer bones of the lower leg (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).

The close similarities between &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus sarcophagus&quot; have led many experts to combine them into one genus over the years. &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; was named first, so by convention it is given priority over the name &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, which is sometimes considered its junior synonym. William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown doubted the distinction of the two genera as early as 1922. &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; was formally reassigned to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; (as &quot;Albertosaurus libratus&quot;) by Dale Russell in 1970, and many subsequent authors followed his lead. Combining the two greatly expands the geographical and chronological range of the genus &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;. Other experts maintain the two genera as separate. Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie claims there are as many anatomical differences between &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; as there are between &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which are almost always kept separate. He also notes that undescribed tyrannosaurids discovered in Alaska, New Mexico and elsewhere in North America may help clarify the situation. Gregory S. Paul has suggested that &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; is ancestral to &quot;Albertosaurus sarcophagus&quot;.
Below is the cladogram of Tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Loewen &quot;et al.&quot; in 2013.

== Paleobiology ==

===Diet and feeding===
Just like other tyrannosaurids, bite force of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; increases slowly among young individuals, and then it increases exponentially when they reach the late juvenile stage. In 2012, Jovannelly and Lane estimated that &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; could exert a bite force of at least 22,000, possibly up to 42,000 newtons. Other paleontologists have produced significantly lower bite force estimates. In 2021, given that the largest known &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; had a similar bite force to the similar-sized &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, Therrien and colleagues proposed that the maximum bite force that could be produced by adult albertosaurines is around 12,200 to 21,800 newtons. In 2022, Sakamoto estimated that &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; had an anterior bite force of 6,418 newtons and a posterior bite force of 13,817 newtons.

In 2023, a juvenile &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; (TMP 2009.12.14) with its &quot;in situ&quot; stomach contents containing two &quot;Citipes&quot; juveniles about a year old intact was reported from the Dinosaur Park Formation. This juvenile would have been 5-7 years old at the time of death, measuring about long and weighing around . It is much larger than the two &quot;Citipes&quot; juveniles that weigh about , contrary to the assumption that tyrannosaurids fed on prey of their size once they reached , indicating that juvenile tyrannosaurids still consumed much smaller prey after exceeding a certain size threshold. It’s a direct dietary evidence that reinforces the theory of &#x27;ontogenetic dietary shift&#x27; for tyrannosaurids, as previously inferred by ecological modeling and anatomical features among different age groups. Only the remains of the hindlimbs and caudal vertebrae of juvenile &quot;Citipes&quot; were present in the tyrannosaurid&#x27;s stomach cavity, suggesting that a juvenile &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; may have had preferential consumption of the muscular hindlimbs. Thomas R. Holtz Jr., a paleontologist who also previously theorized that tyrannosaurs underwent a big dietary shift with maturation, said that the fossil &quot;looks like it was Thanksgiving,&quot; as the juvenile &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; was mostly eating the legs of &quot;Citipes&quot;.

=== Life history ===

Gregory Erickson and colleagues have studied the growth and life history of tyrannosaurids using bone histology, which can determine the age of a specimen when it died. A growth curve can be developed when the ages of various individuals are plotted against their sizes on a graph. Tyrannosaurids grew throughout their lives, but underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years, after an extended juvenile phase. Sexual maturity may have ended this rapid growth phase, after which growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. Examining five &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; specimens of various sizes, Erickson calculated a maximum growth rate of about per year during the rapid growth phase, slower than in tyrannosaurines like &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, but comparable to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;.

&quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; spent as much as half its life in the juvenile phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but there is no evidence of gregarious behavior in &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;. 
The discovery of two exceptionally preserved juvenile skulls from &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; suggests that &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; underwent the morphological shift from gracile juveniles to robust adults at an earlier age than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, to which it was compared in a study published by Jared Voris &quot;et al.,&quot; suggests that the ontogenetic changes occurred at roughly 5-7 years of age in &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;; much earlier than its larger and later relative. However, both tyrannosaur genera underwent these ontogenetic transformations at a similar percent of skull length relative to the large known adult individuals. The study&#x27;s results likewise indicate that there is a dissociation between body size and cranial development in tyrannosaurs, while simultaneously allowing better identification of juvenile remains that may have been misidentified in museum fossil collections. It is estimated that an ontogenetic dietary shift of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; occurs when the mandibular length reaches , indicating that this is the stage when their bite force increases exponentially and when they begin to pursuit large prey.
=== Paleopathology ===
Several pathologies have been documented in the &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; holotype, NMC 2120. These include the third right dorsal rib, as well as healed fractures on the 13th and 14th gastralia and left fibula. Its fourth left metatarsal bore roughened exostoses both in the middle and at the far end. The third phalanx of the third right toe is deformed, as the claw on that digit has been described as &quot;quite small and amorphous&quot;. The three pathologies may have been received in a single encounter with another dinosaur.

Another specimen cataloged as TMP94.12.602 bears multiple pathologies. A longitudinal fracture is present in the middle of the right fibula&#x27;s shaft. Multiple ribs bear healed fractures and the specimen had a pseudoarthortic gastralium. Lesions from a bite received to the face were present and showed evidence that the wounds were healing before the animal died.

Another specimen has a poorly healed fracture of the right fibula, which left a large callus on the bone. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 54 foot bones referred to &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.

As with many tyrannosaurids, several &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; specimens show evidence of intraspecific face biting.

Specimen TMP 1994.143.1, a juvenile skull from the Dinosaur Park Formation with several tyrannosaur bite marks, was previously believed to be &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; sp. but was later assigned to &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot;.

TMP 2017.012.0002, is a &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; right maxilla with 5 raised scars; healed injuries from face biting by conspecifics. 

TMP91.36.500 is a very complete sub-adult &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; with preserved face bite injuries and also has a thoroughly healed fracture in the right fibula. Also present was a healed fracture in the dentary and what the authors describing the specimen referred to as &quot;a mushroom-like hyperostosis of a right pedal phalanx.&quot; Ralph Molnar has speculated that this may be the same kind of pathology afflicting an unidentified ornithomimid discovered with a similar mushroom shaped growth on a toe bone. TMP91.36.500 is also preserved in a characteristic death pose.

== Paleoenvironment ==

Most specimens of &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. This formation dates to the middle of the Campanian, between 76.5 and 74.8 million years ago, and &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; fossils are known specifically from the lower to middle section of the formation, between 76.6 and 75.1 million years ago. The Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana have also yielded possible &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; remains. At this time, the area was a coastal plain along the western edge of the Western Interior Seaway, which divided North America in half. The Laramide Orogeny had begun uplifting the Rocky Mountains to the west, from which flowed great rivers that deposited eroded sediment in vast floodplains along the coast. The climate was subtropical with marked seasonality, and periodic droughts sometimes resulted in massive mortality among the great herds of dinosaurs, as represented in the numerous bonebed deposits preserved in the Dinosaur Park Formation. Conifers formed the forest canopy, while the understory plants consisted of ferns, tree ferns and angiosperms. Around 73 million years ago, the seaway began to expand, transgressing into areas formerly above sea level and drowning the Dinosaur Park ecosystem. This transgression, called the Bearpaw Sea, is recorded by the marine sediments of the massive Bearpaw Shale.

The Dinosaur Park Formation preserves a great wealth of vertebrate fossils. A wide variety of fish swam the rivers and estuaries, including gars, sturgeons, sharks and rays, among others. Frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodilians and champsosaurs also dwelled in the aquatic habitats. Azhdarchid pterosaurs and ornithuran birds like &quot;Apatornis&quot; flew overhead, while the enantiornithine bird &quot;Avisaurus&quot; lived on the ground alongside multituberculate, metatherian and eutherian mammals. A number of species of terrestrial lizards were also present, including whiptails, skinks, monitors and alligator lizards. Dinosaur fossils in particular are found with unrivaled abundance and diversity. Huge herds of ceratopsids roamed the floodplains alongside equally large groups of saurolophine and lambeosaurine hadrosaurs. Other herbivorous groups like ornithomimids, therizinosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, small ornithopods, nodosaurids and ankylosaurids were also represented. Small predatory dinosaurs like oviraptorosaurs, troodonts and dromaeosaurs hunted smaller prey than the huge tyrannosaurids; &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, which were two orders of magnitude larger in mass. Intervening predatory niches may have been filled by young tyrannosaurids. A &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot; dentary has been discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation that bore tooth marks left by the bite of a young tyrannosaur, possibly &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;.

=== Coexistence with &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; ===
In the middle stages of the Dinosaur Park Formation, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; lived alongside a rarer species of tyrannosaurid, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. This is one of the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. Similar-sized predators in modern predator guilds are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Niche differentiation between the Dinosaur Park tyrannosaurids is not well understood. In 1970, Dale Russell hypothesized that the more common &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; actively hunted fleet-footed hadrosaurs, while the rarer and more troublesome ceratopsians and ankylosaurians (horned and heavily armoured dinosaurs) were left to the more heavy built &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. However, a specimen of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; (OTM 200) from the contemporaneous Two Medicine Formation of Montana preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region, and another bonebed contains the remains of three &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; along with the remains of at least five hadrosaurs.

Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, neither genus was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other. However, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; appears more common in northern formations like Dinosaur Park, with species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; being more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and saurolophine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana and in southwestern North America during the Campanian, while centrosaurines and lambeosaurines dominate in northern latitudes. Holtz has suggested this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and saurolophines. At the end of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, saurolophines like &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Kritosaurus&quot; and chasmosaurines like &quot;Triceratops&quot; and &quot;Torosaurus&quot; were widespread throughout western North America, while lambeosaurines were rare, consisting of a few species like &quot;Hypacrosaurus&quot;, and albertosaurines and centrosaurines had gone extinct. However, in the case of the centrosaurines, they had thrived in Asia with genera like &quot;Sinoceratops&quot;. While albertosaurine remains have been found in the Hell Creek Formation, it is most likely these are indeterminate remains belonging to a species of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.
