<text>Minsara Kanavu () is a 1997 Indian Tamil-language musical romantic comedy film that was co-written and directed by Rajiv Menon. The film stars Arvind Swamy, Prabhu Deva, and Kajol in her Tamil debut, and revolves around Priya (Kajol), a convent student who wants to become a nun. Having returned to India from his studies overseas, Thomas (Swamy)—Priya&#x27;s childhood friend—falls in love with her following their first meeting at her convent. With the help of hairstylist Deva (Prabhu Deva), who is known for his ability to change woman&#x27;s minds, Thomas tries to dissuade Priya from her ambition but Deva instead falls in love with her.

AVM Productions wanted to make a film to celebrate their golden jubilee in 1997. The project, which would be titled &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot;, was produced by M. Saravanan, M. Balasubramanian, and M. S. Guhan. Menon responded to an advertisement for a director and cinematographer, and made his directorial debut with the film. Venu and Ravi K. Chandran completed the principal photography, and Prabhu Deva choreographed the film. A. R. Rahman composed the soundtrack, which received positive reviews, and the songs &quot;Mana Madurai&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;, &quot;Thanga Thamarai&quot;, and &quot;Vennilave&quot; became popular.

&quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; premiered on 14 January 1997 during the Pongal festival and ran in theatres for over 175 days. The film was a commercial success in Tamil Nadu, though it initially opened to mediocre box-office earnings, but its dubbed versions performed poorly in North India and Telugu states. Critical reception to the film was mixed-to-positive; the plot, the cast&#x27;s performances—particularly that of the lead actors—the screenplay, the cinematography, and the soundtrack were praised. The film won several accolades, including two Cinema Express Awards, one Filmfare Awards South, four National Film Awards, one Screen Awards, and three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.

== Plot ==
Priya is a student at Lawrence School, Ooty known for her friendly, and precocious nature. Since childhood Priya is interested in singing, and attending church. Priya&#x27;s father Amalraj is a widower and a clothing industrialist who expects Priya to look after Amalraj Garments, but her desire is to become a nun. Amalraj tries to stop this by unsuccessfully arranging a marriage for Priya. Thomas Thangadurai, a non-resident Indian, returns to his home town Ooty after earning his Ph.D from Harvard to look after his father James Thangadurai&#x27;s business. James, a former associate of Amalraj, had set up his clothing business opposite Amalraj&#x27;s factory. Amalraj dislikes James due to his boorish and clumsy attitude, even though Thomas and Priya are childhood friends.

Priya, after several years as a Novice at the convent, unexpectedly meets Thomas, who is visiting his aunt, the Mother Superior of the Lawrence School. He takes Priya&#x27;s help in surprising his aunt with a gift on her birthday, and falls in love with Priya but is unable to tell her. Thomas is shocked when he learns of Priya&#x27;s ambition to become a nun; he approaches a hairstylist named Deva, who is known for his ability to change women&#x27;s minds, to dissuade her. Deva is hesitant but accepts. Deva and his friend, a blind, aspiring musician named Guru, befriend Priya and persuade her to join their music troupe. Priya&#x27;s singing talent helps the troupe gain recognition and they are approached to audition for a film. Deva, Guru, and the rest of the troupe play tricks to make Priya fall in love with Thomas. Deva soon realises that he is also falling in love with Priya.

Complications arise when Priya reciprocates Deva&#x27;s love and Thomas, with the help of Deva, declares his love to Priya. Priya finds out about Deva&#x27;s reason for his association with her and, feeling betrayed, decides to return to the convent to undergo Novitiate. She quits the music troupe in Chennai and leaves. Deva tries to persuade Priya to remain with the troupe but he gets into a serious accident and falls into a coma. Priya undergoes the training but cannot forget Deva. Deva recovers from his coma and is visited by Thomas, who is upset and angry but realises Deva and Priya are meant for each other. Thomas rushes to the convent on the day Priya is to become a nun and, with the help of the Mother Superior, changes her mind and persuades her to marry Deva.

Thomas, now a priest, baptizes the daughter of Deva and Priya, who are married. Deva is looking after his father-in-law&#x27;s business and Priya is working as a full-time singer. Guru has become a renowned music composer but is facing charges of plagiarism; James redistributes his wealth to everyone.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
AVM Productions wanted to make a film commemorating their 50th anniversary in 1997. They wanted the film &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot;, which was produced by M. Saravanan, M. Balasubramanian, and M. S. Guhan, to revolve around young people. Before choosing a director, the three producers approached Prabhu Deva to play the male lead and A. R. Rahman to compose the music. Rahman suggested his friend Rajiv Menon, then an advertisement director and film cinematographer, to direct the project. Menon thought about the offer for two months, saying he was not &quot;mentally prepared&quot; to direct a film. Initially reluctant, he was persuaded to direct the project by Rahman and filmmaker Mani Ratnam, and so this became his directorial debut. Menon wrote &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; story, which is based on Robert Wise&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;; he also co-wrote the screenplay with V. C. Guhanathan in English.

=== Casting ===
Arvind Swamy was cast as Thomas, a non-resident Indian who, after returning from his studies abroad, meets and falls in love with his childhood friend Priya; he had earlier been Menon&#x27;s replacement for the lead role in the 1992 film &quot;Roja&quot;. Menon&#x27;s wife Latha suggested the Bollywood actor Kajol to play Priya, making &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; one of her only two appearances in Tamil cinema—the other being in &quot;Velaiilla Pattadhari 2&quot; (2017). He originally wanted Aishwarya Rai for the role but felt she was &quot;too stylish&quot; and that he wanted a woman &quot;who looked Indian&quot;. He recommended her to Ratnam, who he thought was better than Rai; she would instead star in Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Iruvar&quot; (1997), her acting debut. Madhuri Dixit was approached but she rejected the offer due to her busy schedule. Kajol said working on &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; was an &quot;unforgettable experience&quot;, and that she was happy Menon gave her the part immediately after the other actresses rejected it. Kajol, a non-Tamil speaker, had her voice dubbed by Revathi.

Prabhu Deva, the first actor to be cast in the film, played the hairstylist Deva and also choreographed for the film. The producers chose Vikram to dub for him; Menon said they &quot;wanted a new voice for Prabhu Deva&quot;. Nassar, playing the aspiring musician Guru, found the part fun and working in the film to be a &quot;delightful experience&quot;. He described the character as high-spirited and added that &quot;it was like, going through my youth again. Dancing, for instance—I never thought I could dance, but in this film I did it and loved it too.&quot; Janaki Sabesh, who was later known for portraying mother roles, made her acting debut in &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; by playing a nun. S. P. Balasubrahmanyam was chosen to play Thomas&#x27; father James. In his obituary published by &quot;The Hindu&quot; in 2020, Menon said Balasubrahmanyam was &quot;so enthusiastic and joyous on [the] set&quot;, noting that it was interesting to see him acting opposite Girish Karnad, who played Priya&#x27;s father Amalraj.

=== Filming ===
Venu and Ravi K. Chandran did the principal photography on &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot;, and Chandran was credited with providing additional cinematography. Asked on his decision to not handle the cinematography, Menon said working as a director and cinematographer simultaneously could make him not &quot;pay attention to both the departments equally&quot;. Menon even approached his mentor Ashok Mehta to handle the cinematography, but Mehta could not accept due to other commitments. Saravanan&#x27;s brother Palu&#x27;s daughter Lakshmipriya, who had returned from her costume design studies in Singapore, designed the costumes. Thota Tharani finished the art direction, Vikram Dharma was the action director, and Prabhu Deva, Farah Khan, and Saroj Khan did the choreography. Filming took place at Lawrence School, Lovedale; in preparation, Menon interacted with several Christian priests. The song &quot;Thanga Thamarai&quot; was filmed at an artificial waterfall, while the filming for &quot;Poo Pookkum Osai&quot; took place as AVM&#x27;s studios in Madras (now Chennai) and Ooty, Kullu, and Manali. Filming took between 70 and 75 days, and the footage was edited by Suresh Urs.

== Soundtrack ==

&quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; soundtrack album includes six songs that were composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics by Vairamuthu. Recording of the tracks took place at Panchathan Record Inn. The film used different ragas (melodic modes) throughout the soundtrack, with the choral music being written in Sankarabharanam, and the song &quot;Anbendra Mazhayile in Anandabhairavi. In an interview with &quot;Frontline&quot; Balasubrahmanyam said of the recording session of &quot;Thanga Thamarai&quot;: &quot;[I]t required a tone that reflected the feelings of someone totally smitten and intoxicated by love. The character singing the song in the film is on a high after finding his girl.&quot; He said he tried to imitate the composer, who helped to record vocals for the singer. Rahman chose K. S. Chithra for the song &quot;Mana Madurai&quot;, also known as &quot;Ooh La La La&quot;. He advised Chithra not to sing as she usually does but to completely open her voice to sing the track. The re-edited version of the track was featured on the international musical &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot;.

The soundtrack album was released on 25 December 1996, with the cast and crew attending the event and M. K. Stalin, the then-Mayor of Chennai, as the chief guest. Lyrics for the dubbed-Telugu soundtrack were written by Vennelakanti. Javed Akhtar wrote lyrics for the Hindi version of the soundtrack and a new song titled &quot;Teri Meri Baat&quot; was added.

== Release ==
&quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; was released on 14 January 1997 during the Pongal festival released at the same time as Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Iruvar&quot;, with which it competed. On its opening, &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; drew mediocre box-office earnings but it was eventually a success after running for 216 days in Chennai. On 3 August 1997, an event was held to celebrate its silver jubilee. In order to celebrate the film&#x27;s silver jubilee, AVM collaborated with 3 Roses tea brand and conducted a contest where audience who answered questions from the film will be travelling in a special train with cast and crew specially organized for the film&#x27;s silver jubilee.

&quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; Telugu-dubbed version &quot;Merupu Kalalu&quot;, which was also released on 14 January, was a commercial disappointment. &quot;Screen&quot; suggested the possibility of the film, whose themes are intended for youths, being rejected by youths themselves. The magazine also thought that this was due to the producers, who took &quot;a gamble in acquiring the rights of the films without knowing anything of their story or content&quot;. &quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; was dubbed into Hindi as &quot;Sapnay&quot;, which premiered on 2 May 1997 and also failed commercially. The result of the Hindi version caused Menon to stop dubbing his films into that language.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Minsara Kanavu&quot; received mixed response from critics. S. R. of &quot;Kalki&quot; praised the film&#x27;s cinematography and music but criticised the plot and found the climax tiring. K. N. Vijiyan, who reviewed the film for the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, likened its plot with that of a Hollywood film, finding it to be &quot;vaguely similar. But even so, it has been adapted well to suit Indian culture.&quot; Calling the film &quot;good entertainment&quot;, he lauded its screenplay and Kajol&#x27;s performance, adding that she was at her best when she is &quot;her naughty self or belting out songs&quot; such as &quot;Maana Madurai&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, M. S. M. Desai was ambivalent about the Hindi dubbed version &quot;Sapnay&quot;, saying it is filled with many songs and dances that make &quot;the pace of the narrative dull and drab&quot;.

Initial responses to the soundtrack were unfavourable; Desai said Rahman &quot;fails miserably to come up with catchy numbers&quot;, but reception improved in the 21st century. The songs &quot;Mana Madurai&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;, &quot;Thanga Thamarai&quot;, and &quot;Vennilave&quot; became popular. A critic from &quot;Behindwoods&quot; stated Rahman&#x27;s work is &quot;an electrifying effort&quot;, noting it as one of the rarest albums in which all of the songs were chartbusters.

<doc id="1072379" wikidata="Q1601529" url="?curid=1072379" title="Variorum">
<text>A variorum, short for &quot;(editio) cum notis variorum&quot;, is a work that collates all known variants of a text. It is a work of textual criticism, whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The Bible and the works of William Shakespeare have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;variorum&quot; is Latin for &#x27;of various [persons]&#x27; and derives from the phrase &quot;cum notis variorum&quot; (&#x27;with notes by various people&#x27;) which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.

==Original meaning==
An older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: &#x27;an edition of a text (usually Latin or Greek) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators&#x27;. Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of Dutch publishers of the 17th century, including the house of Elzevir. In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period; the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators. The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information. Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, Nicolaas Heinsius&#x27;s edition of Claudian (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.

==Notable variorum editions==
A variorum of the Bible has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with variants in wording, from known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.

There have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of William Shakespeare, including the readings of all quartos and folios; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of Isaac Reed in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, whether to decode dubious lines and elucidate claims of authorial intent or using a more contextualist hermeneutics to uncover other explanations for the textual variations.

Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.

Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times. A variorum was published in 1959.

There is also a variorum of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. Walt Whitman produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime. The New York University Press produced a variorum in 1980 of these various editions.

The James Strachey translation of Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; in volumes four and five of &quot;The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud&quot; collates eight editions.

Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s works have been collated to produce a voluminous digital variorum. It can be viewed on the Bichitra website.

H. P. Lovecraft’s stories have been collected into a four volume variorum edition by Hippocampus Press.

<doc id="1072388" wikidata="Q249278" url="?curid=1072388" title="Victorio">
<text>Victorio (Bidu-ya, Beduiat; ca. 1825–October 14, 1880) was a warrior and chief of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh (or Chihenne, often called Mimbreño) division of the central Apaches in what is now the American states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua.

In Victorio&#x27;s War from September 1879 to October 1880, Victorio led a band of Apaches, never numbering more than 200 men, in a running battle with the U.S. and Mexican armies and the civilian population of New Mexico, Texas, and northern Mexico, fighting two dozen skirmishes and battles. He and most of his followers were killed or captured by the Mexican army in the Battle of Tres Castillos in October 1880.

==Early life==
Victorio was born around the year 1825 near the Hacienda Encinillas, Chihuahua City (&quot;Ją’éłąyá&quot;), Mexico and its believed he was baptized with the name of &quot;Pedro Cedillo&quot;, on his early childhood he was taken from the hacienda by the Chihenne band during a raid to the site and he was raised as a warrior, then he received the name &quot;Biduya&quot;.

Victorio grew up in the Chihenne band. There is speculation that he or his band had Navajo kinship ties and was known among the Navajo as &quot;He Who Checks His Horse&quot;. Victorio&#x27;s sister was the famous woman warrior Lozen, or the &quot;Dextrous Horse Thief&quot;.

==Tchihendeh chief==
In 1853 he was considered a chief or sub-chief by the United States Army and signed a document. In his twenties, he rode with Mangas Coloradas, leader of the Coppermine band of the Tchihendeh people and principal leader of the whole Tchihendeh Apache division (who took him as his son-in-law), and Cuchillo Negro, leader of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh people and second principal leader of the whole Tchihendeh Apache division, as well as did Nana, Delgadito, Cochise, Juh, Geronimo and other Apache leaders. Mangas Coloradas taught Victorio how to create an ambush and to wait for enemies to enter the killing zone. As was the custom, he became the leader of a large mixed band of Mimbreños and Mescaleros (led by his friend – and probably brother-in-law as the husband of another daughter of Mangas Coloradas, as well the same Cochise – Caballero) and fought against the United States Army.

From 1870 to 1880, Victorio, chief of the Coppermine Mimbreños and principal leader of all the Tchihende, along with Loco, chief of the Warm Spring Mimbreños and second-ranking among the Tchihende, were moved to and left at least three different reservations, some more than once, despite their bands&#x27; request to live on traditional lands. Victorio, Loco, and the Mimbreños were moved to San Carlos Reservation in Arizona Territory in 1877. 

==Victorio&#x27;s War==
Victorio and his followers (including Nana, Nana&#x27;s Mescalero wife, and San Juan) left the reservation twice, seeking and temporarily obtaining hospitality in Fort Stanton Reservation among their Sierra Blanca and Sacramento Mescalero allies, before they came back to Ojo Caliente only to leave permanently in late August 1879, which started Victorio&#x27;s War. Despite Nautzili&#x27;s efforts, many Northern Mescalero warriors, led by Caballero and Muchacho Negro, joined him with their families, and San Juan and other Mescaleros also left their reservation; many Guadalupe and Limpia Mescalero too (Carnoviste and Alsate were close allies to Victorio after 1874) joined Victorio&#x27;s people. Victorio was successful at raiding and evading capture by the military and won a significant engagement at Las Animas Canyon in what is now the Aldo Leopold Wilderness on September 18, 1879.

Within a few months, Victorio led an impressive series of other fights against troops of the 9th, 10th, and 6th U.S. Cavalry near the Percha River (Rio Puerco) (January 1, 1880), in the San Mateos Mountains (January 17, 1880) and the Cabello Mountains near the Animas Creek (January 30, 1880), and again near Aleman&#x27;s Wells, San Andres Mountains west of White Sands, (February 2, 1880), then again in the San Andres Mountains (perhaps near Victorio Peak) routing the cavalrymen and chasing them to the Rio Grande (February 9, 1880), then (April 4, 1880) at Hembrillo Canyon, San Andres Mountains. In April 1880, Victorio was credited with leading the Alma Massacre – a raid on United States settlers&#x27; homes around Alma, New Mexico. During this event, 41 settlers were killed. Victorio&#x27;s warriors were finally driven off by the arrival of American soldiers from Fort Bayard. However, Victorio continued his campaign with the attack on Fort Tularosa, where his warriors had to face a detachment (K troop) of the 9th Cavalry and were repulsed by the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; after a harsh fight. Victorio&#x27;s camp near the Rio Palomas, in the Black Range, was surprised and attacked on May 23–25, 1880, but the Mimbreños and Mescaleros succeeded in repulsing the soldiers. After the Rio Palomas battle, Victorio went on some raids to Mexico repeatedly fording the Rio Grande, after having been intercepted and beaten off, with a 60 warriors&#x27; party, at Quitman Canyon (July 30, 1880). Chased by more than 4,000 armed men (9th, 10th, 6th U.S. Cavalry, 15th U.S. Infantry, Texas Rangers), Victorio evaded all of them for more than a month. On August 9, 1880, Victorio and his band attacked a stagecoach and mortally wounded retired Major General James J. Byrne.

== Last stand and death ==
In October 1880, in north-eastern Chihuahua (a land well known to the Guadalupe and Limpia Southern Mescaleros), having sent Nana and Mangus to raid for food and ammunition, Victorio, with only a few warriors and even less ammunition, and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army under Colonel Joaquin Terrazas in the Battle of Tres Castillos.

An 1886 appendix for Papers Relating to the Foreign Nations of the United States states that, contemporaneously, the Tarahumara Scout credited with killing Victorio in 1880 was Mauricio Corredor. The Apache version states that Victorio actually committed suicide with a knife rather than face capture, and historians such as Kathleen Chamberlain note that the Mexicans at the battle could not identify which body was Victorio&#x27;s.

==Legacy==
A memorial statue of Victorio riding a horse is located in the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, as a recognition to the N’nee (Chiricahua) and Apache peoples. Victorio Peak was named for him following the Battle of Hembrillo Basin.

===Media===
Victorio has been depicted in several films, including;
* &quot;Hondo&quot; (U.S., 1953) by John Farrow, with Michael Pate as Victorio;
* &quot;Fort Bowie&quot; (U.S., 1958) by Howard W. Koch with Larry Chance as Victorio;
* &quot;Apache Rifles&quot; (U.S., 1964) by William Witney with Joseph Vitale as Victorio;
* &quot;Hondo&quot; (U.S., 1967) by Lee H. Katzin, with Michael Pate as Victorio;
*&quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; (U.S., 1997) by Charles Haid with Harrison Lowe as Victorio.

In the Philippe Morvan&#x27;s novel, &quot;Ours&quot;, published in 2018 by Calmann-Lévy, Victorio is an important character of the plot.

<text>The Nakajima G8N &quot;Renzan&quot; (連山, &quot;Mountain Range&quot;) was a four-engined, long-range bomber designed for use by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Navy designation was &quot;Type 18 land-based attack aircraft&quot; (十八試陸上攻撃機); the Allied code name was Rita.

==Design and development==
In February 1943, the Imperial Navy staff asked Nakajima Aircraft Company to design a four-engined bomber, capable of meeting an earlier specification set for a long-range, land-based attack plane. The final specification, issued on 14 September 1943, called for a plane with a maximum speed of able to carry a bomb-load or a reduced bomb-load .

Nakajima&#x27;s design featured a mid-mounted wing of small area and high aspect ratio, a tricycle landing gear, and a large single-fin rudder. Power came from four 2,000 hp Nakajima NK9K-L &quot;Homare&quot; 24 radial engines with Hitachi 92 turbosuperchargers driving four-bladed propellers. The engines were cooled by counter-rotating fans positioned just inside the engine cowlings. Defensive armament included power-operated nose, dorsal, ventral, and tail turrets, along with two free-swiveling machine guns at the beam positions.

==Operational history==
The initial prototype was completed in October 1944 and delivered to the Navy for testing in January 1945, a year after the Navy ordered development to start. Three further examples were completed by June 1945, with the third prototype being destroyed on the ground by US carrier aircraft.

Other than minor problems with the turbosuperchargers, the &quot;Renzan&quot; performed satisfactorily, and the Navy hoped to have a total of sixteen prototypes and 48 production-version G8N1s assembled by September 1945. However, the worsening War situation and a critical shortage of light aluminium alloys led to the project&#x27;s cancellation in June.

One proposed variant was the G8N2 Renzan-Kai Model 22, powered by four 2,200 hp Mitsubishi MK9A radial engines and modified to accept attachment of the air-launched Ohka Type 33 Special Attack Bomber.

Just before Japan&#x27;s surrender in August 1945, consideration was also briefly given to producing an all-steel version of the aircraft to be designated G8N3 Renzan-Kai Model 23, but the cessation of hostilities precluded any further development.

After the War, one prototype was taken to the United States and scrapped after testing. None are in existence today.

==Variants==
* G8N1 : Four-engine heavy bomber. Production version.
* G8N2 : Modified to carry Ohka Type 33 Special Attack Bomber. Four Mitsubishi MK9A radial engines.
* G8N3 : All-steel airframe - never produced.

==Operators==
* Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service
** Naval Air Technical Arsenal (and after february 1945, reorganised to 1st Naval Technical Arsenal)

<text> () is a highly influential commentary of the Qur&#x27;an, written during 1951-1965 by the Egyptian revolutionary Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966), a leader within the Muslim Brotherhood. He wrote (or re-wrote) most of the original 30 volumes (114 Surahs) while in prison following an attempted assassination of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1954. The book outlines Qutb&#x27;s vision of a Muslim state and society.

The work extends to 30 volumes that correspond to the 30 juz&#x27; parts of the Qur&#x27;an. It has been translated into several languages, including English, French, German, Urdu, Turkish, Indonesian, Persian, Malayalam and Bengali. The full set of volumes covers the entire Qur&#x27;an.

==Contents==
From a social and political standpoint, some of the more important conclusions Qutb drew in his interpretation include:

*On freedom of religion: Islam came to declare and establish the great universal principle that: &quot;There shall be no compulsion in religion. The right way is henceforth distinct from error.&quot; (Verse 256) This reflects the honour God has reserved for man and the high regard in which man&#x27;s will, thought and emotions are held, and the freedom he is granted to choose his beliefs, and the responsible position he is afforded to be judge of his own actions. Here lies the essence of human emancipation which 20th-century authoritarian and oppressive ideologies and regimes have denied mankind. Modern man has been deprived of the right to choose and live other than according to what is dictated by the state, using the full force of its colossal machinery, laws and powers. People are today given the choice only to adhere to the secular state system, which does not allow for a belief in God as the Creator and Master of the world, or to face annihilation. Freedom of belief is the most basic right that identifies man as a human being. To deny anyone this right is to deny him or her humanity. Freedom of belief also implies the freedom to express and one&#x27;s belief without fear of threat or persecution; The Quran asserts this. Islam gives everyone the right to exercise freedom of expression as long as they do not intrude upon the freedom and dignity of other people. There is no place for the propagation of evil and wickedness in Islam.
*On the issue of human relationships:

:Allah wishes human life to be elevated, happy, based on pure motives and characterised by mutual compassion, brotherhood and purity of hearts and behaviour.

*On the Victimization of Children of Israel by the Pharaoh:

:Tyrants are always ready to commit any crime, without hesitation, in order to retain power...That is tyranny: ignorant and stupid, but at the same time arrogant and conceited.

:The Children of Israel suffered persecution on a similar scale by Pharaoh and his clique, as stated in Sūrah 28, The Story, in which we read: &quot;Pharaoh made himself a tyrant in the land. He divided his people into casts, one group of which he persecuted, putting their sons to death and sparing only their daughters. Truly, he was an evildoer.&quot; (28: 4). This is characteristic of tyranny everywhere, in all periods of history. It still resorts today to the same methods it employed centuries ago.

*Opposition to Theocracy:

:Establishing the rule of God on earth does not mean that sovereignty is assigned to a particular group of people, as was the case when the Church wielded power in Christian Europe, or that certain men become spokesmen for the gods, as was the case under theocratic rule.

*On Equality:

:It is only under this system that God’s law applies equally and in the same way to all people, rulers and ruled, white and black, rich and poor.

*The importance of implementing true Islamic law and danger of people who &quot;oppose the implementation of God&#x27;s law.&quot; These are people &quot;who claim to be Muslims but corruption,&quot;
*Jews as a perpetual opponent of Islam. The threat Jews pose to Islam is emphasized in Qutb&#x27;s commentary on Surah 2:

:The war the Jews began to wage against Islam and Muslims in those early days has raged on to the present. The form and appearance may have changed, but the nature and means remains the same.

:Again, in the commentary on Surah 5:

:The Muslim world has often faced problems as a result of Jewish conspiracies ever since the early days of Islam. ... 
:History has recorded the wicked opposition of the Jews to Islam right from its first day in Medina. Their scheming against Islam has continued since then to the present moment, and they continue to be its leaders, nursing their wicked grudges and always resorting to treacherous schemes to undermine Islam.

Conservative author Paul Berman stated that &quot;In Qutb&#x27;s interpretation, the sins and crimes of the Medina Jews in the seventh century have a cosmic, eternal quality -- rather like the sins and crimes of the Jerusalem Jews in some of the traditional interpretations of the Gospels.&quot;

<text>Spiritwood is a town in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan, Canada with a population of approximately 1,000.
Its location is 125 km west of Prince Albert and about 110 km northeast of North Battleford at the junction of Highway 3, Highway 24 and Highway 376. As the largest community in the region, the community functions as the major supply, service, and administrative headquarters for the trading area population which includes several First Nation reserves including Witchekan Lake, Big River, and Pelican Lake.

==History==
The district began to be settled around 1911–12; however, growth in the area was slow until the coming of the railway in the late 1920s. The first settlers primarily engaged in ranching. The Spiritwood post office, which had been established in 1923, was named after Spiritwood Lake, North Dakota, the hometown of the first postmaster, Rupert J. Dumond. After the railway arrived, settlers of diverse origins poured into the district and many businesses were established.
On October 1, 1935, Spiritwood was incorporated as a village and, by September 1, 1965, the community had grown large enough to attain town status.

This was the scene of the two deaths of RCMP officers in 2006, where after a 12-day manhunt, the suspect surrendered without incident.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Spiritwood had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Economy==
Mixed farming predominates and consists primarily of grain production. A Spiritwood company with global connections that focuses on pig genetics, producing breeding stock and commercial swine, has roughly 50 employees. There is some forestry in the region north of Spiritwood.

==Attractions==
The town has a range of recreational facilities.

Once hometown of the annual Silverbuckle Rodeo, a mid-summer attraction for many years, the grandstands are no more. &quot;SpiritFest&quot; is held annually in August.
Spiritwood Museum is open seasonally throughout the summer months. The museum showcases the community&#x27;s history, including an exhibition of antique farm tractors all freshly restored and in running condition.
Campground facilities available with 12 sites.

Spiritwood is located in the centre of an area that features six golf courses (three grass greens and three sand greens), six regional parks and 35 lakes, all within a 60-minute drive. The lakes have fishing for perch, walleye, pike and trout. Its close proximity to lakes and parks with camping, boating, fishing, golfing, hunting, cross country skiing, snowmobiling, and hiking.

==Infrastructure==
There is sewer/water capacity for 1,500 residents to allow for 50% community growth. Free Wi-Fi, cellular service, and cable television are available.

===Transportation===
There is no bus service available to Spiritwood, so that with the railway gone and grain elevators closed, all bulk commodities including fertilizers, fuel, grain and livestock are transported by truck. Highways 3, 24, and 376 provide access.

Spiritwood Airport (TC LID: CKH7), now defunct, was an uncontrolled public grass strip operated by Town of Spiritwood.

Leoville Airport (TC LID CJT9), is available 32 km north of Spiritwood, located 2 NM (3.7 km // 2.3 mi) west of Leoville, Saskatchewan. This is a public airport operated by the Village of Leoville with two runways. (Runway Direction 12/30; Length 2,400 ft // 732 m; Surface GRAVEL. Runway Direction 16/34; Length 3,400 ft // 1,036 m; Surface TREATED GRAVEL).

===Health Care===
Northern Lakes Health Committee (NLHC), a volunteer group, was set up at Spiritwood in May 2010 with directors selected to represent each of the surrounding communities, organizing fundraising events to support a physician recruitment initiative through a subcommittee.

Since 2006, Spiritwood &amp; District Health Complex was closed &quot;temporarily&quot;, leaving the community at large without acute care facilities. Completed in the fall of 2001, this modern $3.6 million facility encompasses approximately of new construction and of renovated space which is linked to the former Spiritwood Hospital and Idylwild Lodge to serve as one integrated facility.

<doc id="1072399" wikidata="Q2656965" url="?curid=1072399" title="Crossgar">
<text>Crossgar () is a village and townland in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is about south of Belfast – between Saintfield and Downpatrick. Crossgar had a population 1,997 people in the 2021 UK Census.

== History ==
Crossgar has had an interesting and varied past, dating from the establishment of ancient Gaelic royal and ecclesiastical sites, the settlement of Anglo-Norman invaders, to Scots settlers, to the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day riots in the 1800s. According to a history of Down and Connor by a Fr. O&#x27;Laverty, the parish of Kilmore, in which Crossgar lies, was likely to have been established around 800 AD and was the ecclesiastical centre of this part of County Down. It was thought that the area had seven chapels and these can be reasonably evident by the remains of burial grounds. But the seventh cannot be traced to a burial ground and is referred to as the &quot;lost chapel of Cill Glaise&quot;. O&#x27;Laverty says that by tradition this chapel was built by Saint Patrick and left in the care of his disciples Glasicus and Liberius.

The name Crossgar comes from the Irish &quot;An Chrois Ghearr&quot; meaning &quot;the short cross&quot;. There is a holy well known as St. Mary&#x27;s Well (&quot;Tobar Mhuire&quot;) which suggests that in this case &quot;crois&quot; (cross) is likely to refer to an ecclesiastical cross, no trace of which now remains. The adjective &quot;gearr&quot; (short) may suggest that the cross was damaged or in some way defective. The parish of Kilmore comes from the Irish &quot;Cill Mhór&quot; meaning &quot;big church&quot; or another possible meaning is &quot;An Choill Mhór&quot; meaning &quot;the big forest&quot;, which suggests that the area was covered by a large forest. Another location of one of the seven chapels is the townland of Killinchy (&quot;Cill Duinsí&quot;) meaning &quot;Duinseach&#x27;s Church&quot;.

Another early name derived from the bridge in the village named after Éimhear Óg Uí Néill was &quot;Ever Oque&quot; or &quot;Everogue Bridge&quot;.

In June 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, Irish Republican Army volunteers attacked the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Crossgar. They opened fire on the building, wounding two officers, and attempted to breach the walls with explosives before withdrawing.

<text>José Juan García a.k.a. CheJuan (October 22, 1940 – December 17, 2002) was the founder of the international drug-rehabilitation institution called Hogar CREA.

==Early years==
García was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico where he was raised by his parents. He had a tough childhood and experienced his first imprisonment when he was 15 years old. At a very young age, he became a drug addict and stole in order to pay for his habit. He went to prison more than once because of his drug problems. However, he was fortunate enough to have met some people who would have a positive influence in his live and change it forever, among them was the educator Ana G. Mendez. He also attributed his acceptance of &quot;Christ&quot; as a reason for his change.

==Hogar CREA==
In 1968, García founded in Puerto Rico a drug-rehabilitiation organization named Hogar CREA (plural Hogares CREA). The acronym &quot;CREA&quot; stands for the &#x27;re-education of the addict&#x27;. Those who enter the program do not have to pay a fee, but must agree to the program&#x27;s strict rules and engage in community service.

Doctors, psychologists and others donate their time. Expenses are covered by the volunteer board of each home. Each home has enough beds for 15 people. 28 thousand people have successfully completed the program, out of 51 thousand addicts who have been treated in 36 years. In is estimated that 92% of those who have completed the program started by García, have completely stayed out of drugs.

García&#x27;s Hogares CREA have over 152 facilities worldwide, including in the United States, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.

==Awards and recognitions==
Among the awards and recognitions he received are:
* The Citizen of the Year in 1974, granted by the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association
* Citizen of the Year 1976, by the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce
* An award from President Ronald Reagan and others for the exemplary community service offered by Hogar CREA in the United States.
* The Government of Puerto Rico named a plaza in Rio Piedras &quot;Plaza José Juan &#x27;Cheguan&#x27; García&quot;.

==Later years==
José Juan García died on December 22, 2002, in San Juan, Puerto Rico from cancer. His son Javier García and his widow Flora Rosario Johnson were involved in a dispute over the control of the organization. The organizations current director is Benjamin Pintor Miranda.

<doc id="1072404" wikidata="Q8036557" url="?curid=1072404" title="World community">
<text>The term world community is used primarily in political and humanitarian contexts to describe an international aggregate of nation states of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.

==Politics==
World community often is a semi-personal rhetorical connotation that represents Humanity in a singular context as in &quot;…for the sake of the World Community&quot; or &quot;…with the approval of the World Community&quot;.

The term sometimes is used to reference the United Nations or its affiliated agencies as bodies of governance. Other times it is a generic term with no explicit ties to states or governments but retaining a political connotation.

==Humanitarianism==
In terms of human needs, humanitarian aid, human rights, and other discourse in the humanities, the world community is akin to the conceptual Global village aimed at the inclusion of non-aligned countries, aboriginal peoples, the Third World into the &quot;connected&quot; world via the communications infrastructure or at least representative ties to it.

==Economics==
In terms of the World economy, the &quot;world community&quot; is seen by some economists as an inter-dependent system of goods and services with semi-permeable boundaries and flexible sets of import/export rules. Proponents of Globalization may tend to establish or impose more rigidity to this framework. Controversy has arisen as to whether this paradigm will strengthen or weaken the world as a community. See World Trade Organization

==Ecology==
When considering Sustainable development and Ecology, the inter-dependence angle generally expands quickly to a Global context. In this paradigm, the planet as a whole represents a single Biome and the World&#x27;s population represents the Ecological succession in a singular eco-system. This also can be recognized as the World Community.

==Religion==
Many religions have taken on the challenge of establishing a world community through the propagation of their doctrine, faith and practice.

In the Baháʼí Faith, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, successor and son of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, produced a series of documents called the Tablets of the Divine Plan. Now in a book form, after their publication in 1917 and their &#x27;unveiling&#x27; in New York in 1919, these tablets contained an outline and a plan for the expansion of the Baháʼí community into Asia, Asia minor, Europe and the Americas, indeed, throughout the planet.

The formal implementation of this plan, known as &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Baha&#x27;s Divine Plan, began in 1937 in the first of a series of sub-plans, the Seven Year Plan of 1937 to 1944. Shoghi Effendi, the leader of the Baháʼí community until 1957 and then the Universal House of Justice from 1963, were instrumental in the organization and design of future sub-plans. This led to the creation and establishment of a world community, with members of the faith estimated to have reached 5 to 6 million in the early 21st century, while also being the second most geographically widespread religion in the world (missing only North Korea and the Vatican City State).

In Buddhism &quot;the conventional Sangha of monks has been entrusted by the Buddha with the task of leading all people in creating the ideal world community of noble disciples or truly civilized people.&quot;

A Benedictine monk, Friar John Main, inspired the World Community for Christian meditation through the practice of meditation centered around the Maranatha mantra, meaning &quot;Come Lord.&quot;

The Lutheran Church in America had issued a social statement - &quot;World Community: Ethical Imperatives in an Age of Interdependence&quot; Adopted by the Fifth Biennial Convention, Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 25-July 2, 1970. Since then The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has formed and retained the statement as a &#x27;historical document&#x27;.

==World peace==
The term world community is often used in the context of establishing and maintaining world peace through a peace process or through a resolvable end to local-regional wars and global-world wars. Many social movements and much political theory deals with issues revolving around the institutionalization of the process of propagating the ideal of a world community. A world community is one which has a global vision, is established throughout the world, that is it has a membership that exists in most of the countries on the planet and that involves the participation of its members in a variety of ways.

<doc id="1072409" wikidata="Q1917717" url="?curid=1072409" title="Yellow Grass">
<text>Yellow Grass is a town in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. It is located in the Rural Municipality of Scott No. 98, approximately northwest of Weyburn, at the junction of Highways 39 and 621. The town is located on the Canadian Pacific Railway Soo Line, at an elevation of above sea level.

The town was founded as an unincorporated village and named after the yellow prairie grass that surrounds the area. The town was built shortly after the railway line was completed in 1893. The town site itself was surveyed in 1882. The town applied to the North-West Territories government July 22, 1903 and became an incorporated village. On February 15, 1906 Yellow Grass was incorporated as a town.

The town itself has a primarily agricultural based economy. Like other Saskatchewan rural communities the town has seen a large portion of young residents leave to find work in other parts of Canada. Yellow Grass has grown little since the boom years in the early twentieth century; many resident families are descendants of the original pioneers.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Yellow Grass had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Economy ==
Yellow Grass has a primary agrarian economy, with many residents working as farmers, or providing services to farmers. Primary crops grown around Yellow Grass are wheat, durum wheat, barley, lentils, peas, canola, and flax. Some local producers also raise cattle, as well as bison and elk. A tertiary service industry provides general services for town residents and travellers along Highway 39. A substantial number of residents are employed in the nearby city of Weyburn, many in the manufacturing sector, retail sales, the health region, and in the oilfields.

Yellow Grass has gone through a couple of boom cycles in the early years of the town. The first boom started in 1899, when most of the original town infrastructure was founded. This boom attracted many new businesses to the town, as other towns were not yet as organized. This boom would level off at the start of World War I.

The second, and by far the biggest boom, started in the post war years and continued until the late 1920s as the trading area of the region. The building of Highway 39 and access to larger centres marked the beginning of decline of Yellow Grass as a commercial centre. The onset of the Great Depression and substantial crop failures would take its toll on the town.

The agricultural industry made a recovery in the post-World War II years with record setting crops, and the community recovered its municipal services. In the last few decades the economy has been relatively stagnant, with most of the town&#x27;s youth leaving to find employment in larger communities. Pressures on farming due to weather and high fuel and equipment costs have been keeping the growth of agriculture in check.

== Climate and geography ==

Yellow Grass is in a region of Canada known as the Great Plains, and situated well into the Canadian Prairies. The area is generally flat, but provides land suitable for large-scale farming. A few small, intermittent lakes populate the surrounding area. These lakes form as a result of the spring runoff when the snow melts, and vary in size depending on annual rainfall. In hot, dry years, some lakes can completely disappear, as no streams or rivers drain into the lakes.

The climate is usually dry; however, Yellow Grass receives enough precipitation in the warmer half of the year to be classified as a humid continental climate (Dfb). The winter usually results in very cold temperatures that reach into the −20s to −30s degrees Celsius, while the summer produces relatively hot, dry temperatures. On average the temperature exceeds 2.4 times per year. What was once the highest recorded temperature in Canadian history was set on July 5, 1937 when the temperature reached at both Yellow Grass and at Midale, Saskatchewan, which is located 64 kilometres southeast of Yellow Grass. This record stood until June 27, 2021 when it was surpassed by Lytton, British Columbia which hit . The mean temperature for July is and January is . Extreme high and low temperatures in Yellow Grass have ranged from in July 1937 to in January 1916.

In the summer there can be fast moving and violent prairie thunderstorms. The thunderstorms can bring large hail and damaging winds.

== Municipal services ==
;Telephone
Yellow Grass was a pioneer in bringing telephone services to southern Saskatchewan. On April 21, 1908 the town founded the Yellow Grass Rural Telephone Company Limited, that provided telephone service to the town and surrounding areas. The company provided service to parts of southern Saskatchewan until March 1957 when the Saskatchewan provincial government purchased the company.

;Power
In 1912 Yellow Grass town council passed a bylaw to appropriate $10,000 to build the first power plant in the town. The plant was an oil-burning 25 horsepower (19 kilowatt) direct current electrical generator. The town quickly outgrew the plant, and by 1920 a more economical coal-fired plant was built. In 1928 the plant was sold to the Montreal Engineering Company, and the town was hooked into the Soo Line power grid. The electric company went through a number of changes over the next couple decades before becoming part of the Saskatchewan Power Commission, which is today known as SaskPower and supplies electricity to the entire province.

;Cemetery
The Yellow Grass town cemetery was established on March 8, 1905. In 1971 The Royal Canadian Legion established a memorial plot and named it the Field of Vanquished, to honour the Yellow Grass citizens who perished in war. The original cemetery is still in operation today.

;Library
The Southeast Regional Library – Yellow Grass Branch, opened on January 31, 1967 after years of lobbying efforts, including letters and petitions. The Library was in the old Yellow Grass Herald publishing building. Before the library could open the town started renovating the building in 1966. Today it is located in the old Stone school.

;Water works
The town of Yellow Grass first started thinking about sanitation in the early 1900s when cesspools were designated for controlled removal of sewage. In 1916 Yellow Grass purchased galvanized sanitary pails to be used in a sewage collection service. Sewer lines were installed in 1958, that system has remained largely unchanged since then. A new water treatment plant was installed in 2011, providing the town with much better water quality as before.

;Education
The Yellow Grass School District no. 539 was established on March 24, 1900. The first school was built later that year known as the &quot;Old Old School&quot;. In late 1902 a larger school was constructed known as &quot;The Stone School&quot;. The town continued to grow, and in March 1913 a larger school was constructed known as &quot;The Brick School&quot;.

On June 1, 1952, the Yellow Grass School District no. 539 was annexed by Milestone School Unit No. 12 when the provincial government moved to centralize school administration. Yellow Grass High School was completed on March 6, 1964. The High School has since become the only school and was renamed Yellow Grass School. In the years following Yellow Grass seen the school district boundaries change many times. The school is currently part of the Southeast Cornerstone School Division #205.

;Emergency response
The town set up a volunteer fire department in June 1906 and ordered two fire engines at a cost of $972.18 each. In 1913 a by-law was passed to pay firemen $1.00 per hour during a fire, and $0.50 per hour during practice. With a bonus of $3.00 to the team that arrived first at the fire. In 1960 the first fire station was built, along with the purchase of a new pumper truck. Standby equipment was purchased in 1977.

Around 2015 Yellow Grass Fire Rescue moved into their current fire hall at 308 Railway Ave. E. In early 2015 Yellow Grass Fire Rescue purchased a used Freightliner FL80 pumper truck, designated Engine 1, to accommodate the increasing amount of necessary equipment. Due to the number of accidents on Highway 39, the need for hydraulic extrication tools arose, and in 2014 YGFR purchased Jaws of Life. In 2017 YGFR purchased a Ram 2500 utility/brush truck. Around the same time, Engine 2, a 1984 Ford fire engine, and the Rescue Unit, a modified ambulance, were retired.

Medical emergencies are handled by Sun Country Health Region EMS out of Weyburn, but the Yellow Grass Medical First Responders also respond to any medical call in town and the surrounding area, as they can render aid much sooner and handle scenes until Weyburn EMS arrives.

Police duties are handled by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from the Milestone detachment. Yellow Grass long had a small police presence since the towns formation. When the North-West Mounted Police closed down their detachment, a holding cell was constructed in the power plant. The town also had their own municipal police service for a long number of years, but it was abolished as the RCMP took over policing of the area.

== Transportation ==

The railroad was the lifeblood of the town in the early years. Canadian Pacific Railway used to provide passenger train service to the town until the early 1960s. Since then travel to and from town is done almost exclusively by automobile. Today Highway 39 travels through town making a quick and convenient drive to Weyburn, as well as Regina and Moose Jaw. Twice daily passenger bus service used to be provided by STC, the provincially owned bus line, until STC ceased operations in May 2017.

The railway, still owned by Canadian Pacific Railway, passes right by the town, but is not being used to collect grain anymore since late 2014 when Yellow Grass&#x27; last grain elevator was torn down, following the same trend occurring all over the prairies.

== Media ==

From 1910 to the early 1930s Yellow Grass had a newspaper called the Yellow Grass Herald. The newspaper changed owners over the years, and names as well.

== Politics ==

Yellow Grass has a town council that has been in operation since 1906. The community has been electing members since August 5, 1903 for the position of &quot;Overseer&quot;. The overseer position is similar to that of a mayor except that there is no town council, and the primary duty is to file the annual financial statements.

When the town was incorporated in 1906, the overseer position was abolished. The town held its first election to elect a mayor and six at large councillors. Elections were held every year up until the 1970s; now the town holds elections every two years. J.H. Allen became the first mayor in a hotly contested race. The first meeting of the council occurred on March 13, 1906.

Currently, Yellow Grass is in the provincial riding of Weyburn-Big Muddy and federally in the Souris—Moose Mountain. Federally, Yellow Grass has sent one hometown resident to the House of Commons of Canada. John Morrison, a Yellow Grass area farmer, ran for the Progressive Party of Canada was first elected in 1921 and defeated in 1925. A number of residents have run for provincial legislature as well, most recently including Barry Chase in Alberta. No one from Yellow Grass has successfully been elected to a provincial legislature.

== Sports ==
Two ice hockey players from Yellow Grass have played in the National Hockey League:
*Peter Schaefer played for the Vancouver Canucks, Ottawa Senators, and the Boston Bruins
*Nolan Schaefer, Peter&#x27;s brother, played goal for the San Jose Sharks

Yellow Grass had an organized ice hockey team, the Wheat Kings, that played in the Soo Line Hockey League, that went defunct in 2000. In 2016, the team joined the Big 6 Hockey League and began play in the 2016-2017 season after nearly 20 seasons of no Senior Hockey in the community. There is also a Junior C team by the same name that plays in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley Hockey League. The hockey rink in Yellow Grass is called the Communiplex. The government of Canada donated $11,440 to upgrade the facility as a centennial project.

Yellow Grass had a curling team that represented Western Canada in the very first Brier. They finished in a three-way tie for third place. The town named the local curling rink The Barkwell Rink in honour of the skip O.S. Barkwell. The rink was demolished in 1946, and a new rink named the Memorial Rink was completed in 1948.

In the summertime baseball is the preferred sport, with the &quot;Wheat Kings&quot; teams going back to the early 1900s. All styles of organized baseball have been played including fastpitch softball, slow pitch, and hard ball.

== The impact of war on Yellow Grass ==
During World War I and World War II the prairie provinces sent a significant portion of residents to fight for the Canadian Forces overseas. Yellow Grass was no exception, sending over 32% of the town population to fight in the Second World War.

Yellow Grass would send two men to fight in the Second Boer War; both returned from combat safely.
During the First World War 42 men went overseas to fight, unfortunately 14 would perish in combat, marking the most significant loss for the town during wartime.

Yellow Grass sent a significant number of men to fight in the Second World War. There was a noticeable drain on the town as 167 of the 512 residents went overseas. Ten men from the town died in combat. During both world wars, most of the organized clubs and sports teams halted operations, and the remaining residents focused on farming. Many of the men who fought were descendants of the first Yellow Grass soldiers in the First World War.

In 1971 the Royal Canadian Legion dedicated a special section of the Yellow Grass Cemetery known as the Field of Vanquished to the Yellow Grass war dead.

<doc id="1072419" wikidata="Q3798091" url="?curid=1072419" title="List MP">
<text>A list MP is a member of parliament (MP) elected from a party list rather than a geographic electoral district. The place in Parliament is due to the number of votes the party won, not to votes received by the MP personally. This occurs only in countries with an electoral system based wholly or partly on party-list proportional representation.

==Different systems==
In some countries, seats in a legislative chamber are filled solely in accordance with the share of votes won by each individual party. Thus, all Knesset (MKs) members in Israel are list members. Under this system, MKs are appointed from lists of candidates created by each party until the party has reached its allocated number. In other countries, a more complicated system is used. In the method used in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, some seats are filled using party lists, while others are filled by the &quot;traditional&quot; first-past-the-post (FPP) voting system. Under the mixed member proportional (MMP) system, the method used in Germany and New Zealand, a merger of party-list representation and geographic representation is employed — parties contest geographic seats (districts) but are then &quot;topped up&quot; with members from a party list.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand has at least 120 members of Parliament (MPs), out of which there are 72 electorate seats elected using FPP, and the other MPs are selected from the party lists. The number of list MPs each party receives is the difference between a party&#x27;s proportional allocation of parliamentary seats and its number of electorate MPs. Since the introduction of the list of MPs, New Zealand parliaments have been more proportionate.

==Controversies==
The existence of a list of MPs has caused controversy in some countries. It is sometimes complained that because list MPs do not have a geographic electorate, they are not properly accountable to anyone. In addition, the methods used to create party lists are sometimes criticised as undemocratic — in a closed list system, the public has no way of influencing the composition of a party list. In this situation, the public cannot support one candidate without supporting other candidates from the same party. Supporters of party-list proportional representation sometimes retort that the public often has little control over the selection of local candidates, either — if a voter&#x27;s preferred party selects a poor candidate, the voter is forced to either vote for a candidate they dislike or vote for a party they dislike. Under a party list system, voters can support their preferred party even if they are unwilling to vote for its local candidate.

An open list system, however, may go some way to addressing the concern that voters can only support all the candidates the party proposed. A notable example of this was in the 2006 Dutch general election. The VVD had chosen Mark Rutte as their list puller (lijsttrekker). In the Netherlands, the party leader usually gets a large majority of the votes for that party, but in 2006, the number 2 on the list, Rita Verdonk, got over 10% more votes than Mark Rutte. This eventually led to Rita Verdonk leaving the VVD and starting her own party.

There is also debate about the right of a list MP to switch parties. Because list MPs gain their seats by virtue of being on a party list rather than by winning votes personally, some contend that the party, not the MP, is the rightful &quot;owner&quot; of the seat. In New Zealand, there have been several controversies regarding list MPs who left their parties — Alamein Kopu, elected from the Alliance list, controversially became an independent, and Donna Awatere Huata, elected from the ACT list, similarly became an independent. In the latter case, Awatere Huata&#x27;s former party went to the Supreme Court to expel her from Parliament under so-called waka-jumping or &quot;party-hopping&quot; legislation. ACT alleged that it was ACT, not Awatere Huata, who was awarded the seat in the last election and that when Awatere Huata left ACT, she should not have been able to take the seat with her. ACT&#x27;s view was accepted, and Awatere Huata was expelled from Parliament.

<text>Davidson is a town in south central Saskatchewan, Canada. It is south-east of Saskatoon beside provincial highway 11 as well as Highway 44, in the Rural Municipality of Arm River No. 252. Approximately halfway between Saskatoon and Regina, it is a popular stopping point with many restaurants and gas stations located adjacent to the highway.

==History==
In 1902 Colonel Andrew Duncan Davidson, an enthusiastic entrepreneur from Glencoe, Ontario, came to Saskatchewan in hopes of creating a &#x27;midway&#x27; settlement between the cities of Regina and Saskatoon. With agriculture as one of his driving passions, Davidson, through the Saskatchewan Valley Land Company, purchased from the railway and the federal government in an area where the soil was particularly suitable for grain farming. Davidson organized a train route that travelled from Chicago to Saskatoon; making one stop in Davidson on the way. This train route brought American bankers, entrepreneurs and newspapermen in hopes of starting up new businesses in the area. With the expansion of the community underway, Davidson also managed to sell more than of land in the area.

Within a short period of time, Davidson, which was declared the name of the community, was nicknamed the &#x27;Midway Town&#x27; because of its central location. On 15 November 1906, Davidson was officially declared a town.

During World War II the Royal Canadian Air Force built and operated RCAF Station Davidson as a component of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The station was constructed on a site east of the town. This site should not be confused with Davidson Municipal Airport which is adjacent to the town, on the south end.

==Education==
Davidson Elementary School and Davidson High School were formerly part of the Davidson School Division, which also included schools in the communities of Kenaston, Craik and Eyebrow. As of January 1, 2006, DES and DHS are part of the Sun West School Division. In a small community, the school is at its core. This allows many opportunities for the community to get actively involved in the school and vice versa. Some of the partnerships between the school and the community include working for &quot;Communities in Bloom,&quot; contributing to the recycling program at SARCAN, and planting trees around the newly established walking trail. Davidson School&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;Developing, Encouraging, Succeeding; Creating the Future&quot;.

==Media==
The community newspaper is &quot;The Davidson Leader&quot;, publishing since 1904.

<text>Richard Louis Evans (March 23, 1906 – November 1, 1971) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) (1953–71); the president of Rotary International (1966–67); and the writer, producer, and announcer of &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot; (1929–71).

==Biography==
Evans was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. In the late 1920s, he served as a missionary for the LDS Church in the United Kingdom. While on his mission, Evans served as associate editor of the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;, a periodical published by the mission. He received bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from the University of Utah. There, he joined Pi Kappa Alpha.

His master&#x27;s degree was in economics. Over the years he served on the boards of directors of several companies.

In the late 1920s, he took a job with KSL radio as an announcer and script writer. He was also employed as the managing editor of the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; starting in 1936. He worked with the era for 30 years and eventually became its senior editor. He was also closely involved with the changes that led to the replacement of the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; with the &quot;Ensign&quot;, &quot;New Era&quot; and &quot;Friend&quot; in 1971.

In 1937, Evans&#x27; book &quot;A Century of &quot;Mormonism&quot; in Great Britain&quot; was published with a copyright by Heber J. Grant, as trustee-in-trust for LDS Church. Evans also served for a time as the president of the Temple Square Mission.

Evans may have been best known as the announcer for the weekly Mormon Tabernacle Choir radio broadcast, &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot;: every week, he wrote, produced, and announced the radio broadcasts, including a short inspirational message. His involvement in these weekly broadcasts spanned from its inception in 1929 until his death in 1971.

Evans&#x27; voice was familiar to Latter-day Saints as the narrator of various church productions, most notably &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Happiness&quot;. He also introduced the Salt Lake City choir&#x27;s contribution to Bing Crosby&#x27;s annual &quot;Christmas Sing with Bing&quot; radio broadcasts during the 1950s, and is heard on the 1956 Decca LP of the same name, which featured the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Sing&quot; edition.

Evans served as president of the University of Utah alumni association for three terms and as a member of its board for 12 years. He also served for a time as a member of the Utah State Board of Higher Education.

Evans first became a church general authority in 1938 when he was called as a member of the First Council of the Seventy. Evans was ordained an apostle on October 8, 1953, following the death of Albert E. Bowen.

Evans was the last LDS Church apostle to have facial hair while in office, wearing a neatly trimmed mustache until the mid-1960s.

Evans died at age 65 on November 1, 1971. The vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from his death was filled by Marvin J. Ashton. Evans was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Known for his ability to reach across religious differences, the Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding at Brigham Young University was created in his honor on November 1, 1972

<text>Irving Novick (; April 11, 1916 – October 15, 2004) was an American comics artist who worked almost continuously from 1939 until the 1990s.

==Career==
A graduate of the National Academy of Design, Irv Novick got his start in the workshop of Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler. From about 1939 to 1946, Novick was working for MLJ Comics, the company that would later be known as Archie Comics. He became the primary artist for their superhero comics, including the characters the Shield (the first patriotic superhero), Bob Phantom, the Hangman, and Steel Sterling, until MLJ cut back on these titles to focus more on their Archie comics.

He joined the United States Army on April 17, 1943.

From 1946 to 1951, Novick worked in advertising and for the largely unsuccessful comic strips &quot;Cynthia&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Avenger&quot;. His long association with DC Comics began when he was hired by editor Robert Kanigher, who had previously written Novick-illustrated comics for MLJ. Novick and Kanigher would be friends and colleagues for many years. Initially, Novick was primarily an artist on war comics such as &quot;Our Army at War&quot; and occasionally romance comics. Kanigher and Novick introduced the Silent Knight character in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #1 (Aug. 1955).

Novick left DC for the Johnstone and Cushing advertising agency in the 1960s, but was unhappy in advertising and was lured back to DC by Kanigher with a freelance contract, a guarantee of steady work and certain perks which was at the time unprecedented. After editorial and management changes in 1968, Novick began drawing superhero titles such as &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;, and &quot;The Flash&quot;. Novick and writer Frank Robbins crafted the story which revealed the last name of Batman&#x27;s butler Alfred Pennyworth in &quot;Batman&quot; #216 (Nov. 1969). The Robbins and Novick team was instrumental in returning Batman to the character&#x27;s gothic roots, such as in the story &quot;One Bullet Too Many&quot;. Robbins and Novick created the Ten-Eyed Man in &quot;Batman&quot; #226 (Nov. 1970) and the Spook in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #434 (April 1973). He and Dennis O&#x27;Neil launched &quot;The Joker&quot; series in May 1975. Novick drew the introductions of Duela Dent in &quot;Batman Family&quot; #6 (July–Aug. 1976) and the Electrocutioner in &quot;Batman&quot; #331 (Jan. 1981). Novick continued to work, still under contract, until failing eyesight prompted his retirement in the 1990s.

==Influence==
A panel Novick drew in &quot;All-American Men of War&quot; #89 (Jan.–Feb. 1962) of a U.S. Air Force plane shooting down an enemy plane with the onomatopoeia &quot;WHAAM!&quot; was later appropriated for Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s painting of that name.

==Awards==
Irv Novick received an Inkpot Award in 1995.

<text>Malaysian Sign Language (, or BIM) is the principal language of the deaf community of Malaysia. It is also the official sign language used by the Malaysian government to communicate with the deaf community and was officially recognised by the Malaysian government in 2008 as a means to officially communicate with and among the deaf, particularly on official broadcasts and announcements. BIM has many dialects, differing from state to state.

Malaysian Sign Language was created with the establishment of the Malaysian Federation of the Deaf in 1998, and its use has expanded among deaf leaders and participants. It is based on American Sign Language (ASL), but the two are considered different languages.

Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia or Manually Coded Malay (KTBM) is another teaching method created by hearing educators and linguists in between 1980 and 1986 and remains the only form of sign recognized by the Malaysian Ministry of Education as a method to teach Malay to deaf students in formal education settings rather than act as an official language. However, it is not a language in itself, but a means of manually coding the Malay language. The use of KTBM supposedly makes it easier for teachers to teach the Malay language to deaf students.

Sign languages which predate BIM in Malaysia are Penang Sign (PSL) and Selangor Sign (Kuala Lumpur Sign, SSL or KLSL). Additionally, every parent of deaf children uses unique created signs, called home signs, for gestural communication. The use of such home signs among &quot;peranakan&quot; or ethnic Chinese users of BIM may be responsible for the controversy over the supposed influence of Chinese Sign Languages, which is not well documented and may merely be based on ethnic stereotyping.

To further educate and promote the use of BIM, MFD implemented the BIM Sign Bank as the official source of reference for the sign language to the community, including students, teachers, parents, and the general users. In collaboration with Guidewire Gives Back, the BIM Sign Bank application, &quot;BIM Sign Bank by MFD&quot;, was developed and launched in July 2021.

<text>Albert Ernest Bowen (October 31, 1875 – July 15, 1953) was an American lawyer and Mormon religious leader who served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

== Early life and education ==
Born in Henderson Creek, Idaho Territory, to David Bowen and Annie Shackleton, Bowen served as an LDS Church missionary in Switzerland and Germany from 1902 to 1904.

Bowen received a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School. He was a lawyer in Logan, Utah, and the county attorney for Cache County, Utah. He later worked in Salt Lake City.

== Career ==
Bowen joined the &quot;Clark and Richards&quot; law firm on 24 January 1922, changing the name to &quot;Clark, Richards, and Bowen.&quot; Bowen maintained an intimate friendship with J. Reuben Clark and was said to have summarised his three main virtues as having &quot;vigorous and discriminating intellect,&quot; &quot;prodigious power of work,&quot; and &quot;uncompromising, undeviating honesty.&quot;

Later on, Bowen served on the General Board of the Deseret Sunday School Union and as president of the Sunday School Union for the Cache Stake, based in Logan, Utah. In &quot;The Church Welfare Plan&quot;, published by the Deseret Sunday School Union in 1946, Bowen wrote about the need for the Church to care for the poor and infirm and assure them a respectable place in the community. Bowen also argued that as the Saints become more economic prosperous in the early 20th century, wealthier wards were neglecting to collect charity such as monthly fast offerings, and so the burden of welfare relief was increasingly falling upon those in poorer wards.

In 1935, Bowen became the Superintendent of the LDS Church&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA), succeeding George Albert Smith. In 1937, Bowen was chosen by church president Heber J. Grant to fill a spot in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that was left vacant by the death of Alonzo A. Hinckley. At the same time, Bowen was succeeded at the YMMIA by George Q. Morris.

During World War II, Bowen said: &quot;We must... sustain our country to the full measure of the requirement of loyalty and patriotic devotion.&quot; He also believed that &quot;We dare not lose that war,&quot; as defeat would lead to the end of &quot;liberty as we have come to esteem it.&quot;

In 1945, Bowen was on the Board of Trustees for Brigham Young University. Bowen was involved with the search for a new BYU president after World War II, and was one of the strongest supporters, along with John A. Widtsoe, of eventual appointee Ernest L. Wilkinson.
It has been argued Bowen was probably the chief author behind an unsigned review of the prominent book &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; by Fawn M. Brodie, which was one of the first biographies of Joseph Smith to take a secular and critical approach. This review, entitled &quot;Appraisal of the So-Called Brodie Book,&quot; was published on May 11, 1946 in the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. In it, he criticizes the book by dismissing it as being &quot;wholely atheistic&quot; and nothing more than a &quot;composite of all anti-Mormon books that have gone before pieced into a pattern conformable to the author&#x27;s own particular rationale and bedded in some very bad psychology.&quot; It has been further argued that this likely mirrored the Church&#x27;s official position as the review was republished and circulated as a missionary tract of the same title. Later on, in the April general conference of 1946, Bowen himself openly criticized the book, along with some others present, by making a &quot;stirring defense&quot; of Joseph Smith against the &quot;poisonous slander of those who would make him out an imposter.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1902, Bowen married Aletha Reeder; they had two children. She died in 1906, and in 1916 Bowen married singer Emma Lucy Gates. He was married to Gates until her death in 1951.

Bowen died of arteriosclerosis in Salt Lake City at the age of 77. He was replaced in the Quorum of the Twelve by Richard L. Evans. Bowen was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<doc id="1072511" wikidata="Q7398656" url="?curid=1072511" title="Safety life cycle">
<text>The safety life cycle is the series of phases from initiation and specifications of safety requirements, covering design and development of safety features in a safety-critical system, and ending in decommissioning of that system. This article uses software as the context but the safety life cycle applies to other areas such as construction of buildings, for example. In software development, a process is used (software life cycle) and this process consists of a few phases, typically covering initiation, analysis, design, programming, testing and implementation. The focus is to build the software. Some software have safety concerns while others do not. For example, a Leave Application System does not have safety requirements. But we are concerned about safety if a software that is used to control the components in a plane fails. So for the latter, the question is how safety, being so important, should be managed within the software life cycle.

== What is the Safety Life Cycle? ==

The basic concept in building software safety, i.e. safety features in software, is that safety characteristics and behaviour of the software and system must be specified and designed into the system.

The problem for any systems designer lies in reducing the risk to an acceptable level and of course, the risk tolerated will vary between applications. When a software application is to be used in a safety-related system, then this must be borne in mind at all stages in the software life cycle. The process of safety specification and assurance throughout the development and operational phases is sometimes called the ‘safety life cycle’.

== Phases in the Safety Life Cycle ==

The first stages of the life cycle involve assessing the potential system hazards and estimating the risk they pose. One such method is fault tree analysis.

This is followed by a safety requirements specification which is concerned with identifying safety-critical functions (functional requirements specification) and the safety integrity level for each of these functions. The specification may either describe how the software should behave to minimize the risk or might require that the hazard should never arise.

A ‘normal’ process model is then followed with particular attention paid to the validation (inspection, testing etc.) of the system. Part of that validation should be an explicit safety validation activity.

<text>Kod Tangan Bahasa Malaysia (KTBM), or Manually Coded Malay, is a signed form of the Malay language recognized by the government in Malaysia and the Malaysian Ministry of Education. It aids teachers in teaching the Malay language to deaf students in formal education settings. It is not a language but a manually coded form of Malay. It was adapted from American Sign Language (or Manually Coded English), with the addition of some local signs, plus grammatical signs to represent Malay affixation of nouns and verbs. It is used in Deaf schools to teach the Malay language.

The official Malaysian Sign Language, known as &quot;Bahasa Isyarat Malaysia&quot;, is the official sign language the Malaysian government recognizes to communicate with the deaf community, including on official broadcasts. It is a language in its own right and not a manual coding of the Malay language like KTBM. It has been found that Malaysian Sign Language is more effective in teaching students than Manually Coded Malay.

<doc id="1072514" wikidata="Q7680549" url="?curid=1072514" title="Tamagotchi Connection">
<text>The Tamagotchi Connection, known as Tamagotchi Plus in Japan and Tamagotchi Connexion in the UK, is a virtual pet in the Tamagotchi line of digital toys from Bandai. The Tamagotchi Connection is unique from prior models in that it uses infrared technology to connect and interact with other devices and was first released in 2004, 8 years after the first Tamagotchi toy. Using the device&#x27;s infrared port, the virtual pet (referred to as a Tamagotchi) can make friends with other Tamagotchis, in addition to playing games, giving and receiving presents and having a baby. In May 2024, Bandai announced a relaunch of the Tamagotchi Connection to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary. They were officially released in July 2024.

Versions 1 to 4 of Tamagotchi Connection have 6 levels of friendship that can be viewed in the Friends List:
* Acquaintance (one smiley-face)
* Buddy (two smiley-faces)
* Friend (three smiley-faces)
* Good friend (four smiley-faces)
* Best friend (two love-hearts, two smiley-faces, during connection they may kiss)
* Partner (four love-hearts, during connection they will kiss and may have babies)
Versions 5 and 6 have different levels.

If the Tamagotchi cannot find a partner from another device to have babies with, a matchmaker will come, allowing the Tamagotchi to have a baby with a computer-controlled Tamagotchi character. This applies to versions 1 to 4 and 6 only. Version 5 introduces a Dating Show game in which the user must play to gain a CPU partner.

==Versions==
All Tamagotchi Connection devices are capable of connecting with each other; however, a character from a newer Version will show on an older version as the mystery character known as Nazotchi.

===Tamagotchi Connection v2 (2004)===
The Tamagotchi Connection v2 introduces &quot;Gotchi Points&quot;, an in-game currency used to buy shop items. Also, more games are unlocked as the Tamagotchi ages. It has 6 stages of life:
*Egg - This only occurs once the device has been reset, either by pressing the reset button on the rear of the device or by installing a new battery. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Jump.
*Child - The child unlocks the game Bump.
*Teenager - The teenager unlocks the games Flag and Heading.
*Adult - The adult unlocks the game Slot.
*Senior. The senior can only be unlocked if the Tamagotchi stays unmarried for a certain number of days. This applies to all versions.

===Tamagotchi Connection v3 (2006)===
Aside from different games, The Tamagotchi Connection v3 makes few changes in comparison to the v2. Like the v2, the older the Tamagotchi gets, the more games it has access to, and there are still six stages of life.
*Egg - Like the v2, the egg is the first stage and occurs when the device has been reset. When the clock has been set, the egg will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Get Music.
*Child. The child unlocks the game Bump.
*Teenager. The teenager unlocks the games Flag and Heading.
*Adult. The adult unlocks the games Memory and Sprint.
*Senior. Like on the v2, the Senior can only be unlocked if the Tamagotchi stays unmarried for a certain number of days.

Other differences from the v2
*There is no &#x27;Treat&#x27; option in the food.
*There are new &#x27;Password&#x27; and &#x27;Souvenir&#x27; options.
*When you are connecting with another v3, visiting is a new option.
*There are new &#x27;Point&#x27; and &#x27;Family&#x27; options in the friendbook.

=== Tamagotchi Connection v4 Jinsei (2007)===
As in previous versions, Tamagotchis play games for a certain number of &quot;Gotchi Points&quot; and unlock more games as it ages.
*Egg - This only occurs when the device has been reset. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Jumping Rope.
*Child - The child unlocks the game Mimic.
*Teenager - The teenager unlocks the games Shape, Dance and Flag.
*Adult - As an adult, the Tamagotchi can get a job which unlocks various mini-games, depending on what job the player chooses for the Tamagotchi.
*Senior - Much like previous versions, the Senior life stage can only be achieved if the Tamagotchi stays unmarried for a certain number of days.
The Tamagotchi Connection makes additional changes to gameplay instead of simply changing the games and other minor details. For example, the child and teenager can go to school and play mini-games, where an adult can get a job. Also, the &quot;Lamp&quot; menu item (allows the user to turn the &quot;light&quot; on or off) is no longer present. Instead, it is replaced with a &quot;Mail&quot; menu item where the player can check for any mail they will occasionally receive.

New to the Tamagotchi Connection with the v4 is the ability for a child or teenager Tamagotchi to go to school and an adult to go to work. The player can choose which teacher they want once the Tamagotchi reaches the Teenage stage, and will train either &quot;Intelligence Points&quot;, &quot;Style Points&quot; and &quot;Kindness Points&quot; through mini-games. The player also chooses what job an adult Tamagotchi gets and will unlock mini-games based on this choice. It also introduces characters being separated by groups (Mame, Meme, Kuchi and Universal) and genders.

==== Tamagotchi Connection v4.5 ====
The Connection v4.5 makes minimal changes to gameplay from the v4, short of adding new games; however, the way to obtain the Universal family is different.
*Egg - This only occurs when the device has been reset. Once the clock has been set, it will hatch in one minute.
*Baby - The baby unlocks the game Climb.
*Child - The child unlocks the game Tug of War.
*Teenager - The teenager unlocks the games Apples, Shapes, and Man-hole.
*Adult - As an adult, the Tamagotchi can get a job which unlocks various mini-games, depending on what job the player chooses for the Tamagotchi.
*Senior - Much like previous versions, the Senior life stage can only be achieved if the Tamagotchi stays unmarried for a certain number of days.

====PC====
This option is needed to visit the V4 online world of Tamagotchi Town. The Tamagotchi goes off the screen and a Log-In Password is provided. At Tamagotchi Town, the password is entered and Tamagotchi Town appears on-screen. In Tamagotchi Town, many things can be done, such as:

* Shopping for items and food (up to 10)
* Earning &quot;Gotchi&quot; points (up to 9900)
* Earning souvenirs
* Travelling to different countries
* Going to preschool
* Going to school
* Going to work
* Playing games
* Visit previous Tamagotchis

===Tamagotchi Connection v5 Familitchi (2008)===
The Tamagotchi Connection v5 is the English version of the FamiTama and is the first Tamagotchi to be exactly the same (besides language) worldwide since the Tamagotchi Plus. It was released in Asia on January 6, 2008, in Australia on January 10, 2008, and was released worldwide later in February 2008. The v5 introduces the ability to raise families, with 3-5 parents and kids. It also has a new website that it shares with the Famitama, the &quot;Tama and Earth Expo&quot;. According to the package, &quot;The Tamagotchis set up this expo to learn more about Earth.&quot; It contains a central pavilion and 4 other pavilions representing each of the main areas of the Earth. It also included a TV option where the player can use Gotchi Points to shop on the Shopping Channel, find a mate with the Dating Show, or go travelling on the Travelling Show which replaces the pause function of previous generations. There is a design flaw with the v5 which prevents it from properly connecting to the other Tamagotchis in the series.
Differences from previous versions:
*Individual Tamagotchis cannot be named. Instead, a family name is selected and individuals are identified by their character type. 
*There is a family bond percentage
*The Discipline is replaced with a Play option.
*The Medicine chest is expanded to contain general items as well.

====Life stages and games====
*Egg
*Baby
*Child
*Teenager
*Adult
*Parent (replacing the Senior life stage of previous generations)
When raising a family without parents, only the TV Surfing and Tea Time games are available. Having parents unlocks the Golf Putt and Shoe Pairs games. The Tamagotchi Connection v5 also has a v5.5 variant, which brings minimal changes to the generation.

===Tamagotchi Connection v6 Music Star===
The Tamagotchi Connection v6 is the final release in the Connection series and allows the Tamagotchi to become a pop star. As the Tamagotchi ages, it will learn a musical instrument and a band manager will come once the Tamagotchi reaches 5 in-game years of age. Every Tamagotchi Connection v6 includes a guitar pick with a code for Tamatown on it.

====Life Stages and Games====
*Egg
*Baby
*Child
*Teenager
*Adult
*Senior
The Tamagotchi can play all three music games, Sing A Song, Music Notes and Sound Block from birth. The Tamagotchi has a band from the teenager stage, whose members cannot be named, but the band itself can.

====Friendship====
The Adoptive Connection Glitter Pad has 6 levels of friendship which is depends on the level, they will fall in love or not. Below is the list of Friendship Levels.
*Assistant (one smiley face, during connection, they are unlikely to kiss together.)
*Buddy (two smiley faces, during connection, they may kiss.)
*Patron (three smiley faces, during connection, they are equally likely to kiss together.)
*Friend (four smiley faces, during connection, they are equally likely to kiss together and unlikely to have a baby.)
*Good Friend (two love hearts, during connection they may kiss and equally likely to have a baby.)
*Best Friend (four love hearts, during connection they will kiss and likely to have babies.)

<text>Alonzo Arza Hinckley (April 23, 1870 – December 22, 1936) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1934 until his death.

Hinckley was born in Cove Fort, Utah Territory, to Ira Hinckley and Angeline Wilcox Noble. He married his wife Rose May Robison in 1892 in the Manti Temple. Hinckley served as an LDS Church missionary in the Netherlands.

On August 11, 1912, during a conference in Millard County, Utah, Hinckley was selected to be president of the newly formed Deseret Stake, which was located in the western half of Millard County, Utah.

Hinckley was ordained an apostle on October 11, 1934, to fill a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles created by elevation of David O. McKay to the First Presidency following the death of Anthony W. Ivins.

Hinckley died of stomach cancer on December 22, 1936, in Salt Lake City. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. He was succeeded in the Quorum of the Twelve by Albert E. Bowen.

Hinckley was the uncle of LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley.

<doc id="1072520" wikidata="Q1318445" url="?curid=1072520" title="Velocity factor">
<text>The velocity factor (VF), also called wave propagation (relative) speed or (relative) velocity of propagation (VoP or of a transmission medium is the ratio of the speed at which a wavefront (of an electromagnetic signal, a radio signal, a light pulse in an optical fibre or a change of the electrical voltage on a copper wire) passes through the medium, to the speed of light in vacuum. For optical signals, the velocity factor is the reciprocal of the refractive index.

The speed of radio signals in vacuum, for example, is the speed of light, and so the velocity factor of a radio wave in vacuum is 1.0 (unity). In air, the velocity factor is ~0.9997. In electrical cables, the velocity factor mainly depends on the insulating material (see table below).

The use of the terms &quot;velocity of propagation&quot; and &quot;wave propagation speed&quot; to mean a ratio of speeds is confined to the computer networking and cable industries. In a general science and engineering context, these terms would be understood to mean a true speed or velocity in units of distance per time, while &quot;velocity factor&quot; is used for the ratio.

== Typical velocity factors ==
Velocity factor is an important characteristic of communication media such as category 5 cables and radio transmission lines. Plenum data cable typically has a VF between 0.42 and 0.72 (42% to 72% of the speed of light in vacuum) and riser cable around 0.70 (approximately 210,000,000 m/s or 4.76 ns per metre).

Some typical velocity factors for radio communications cables provided in handbooks and texts are given in |the following table:

== Calculating velocity factor ==
===Electric wave===
VF equals the reciprocal of the square root of the dielectric constant (relative permittivity), formula_1 or formula_2, of the material through which the signal passes:

:formula_3

in the usual case where the relative permeability, formula_4, is 1. In the most general case:

:formula_5

which includes unusual magnetic conducting materials, such as ferrite.

The velocity factor for a lossless transmission line is given by:

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the distributed inductance (in henries per unit length), formula_8 is the capacitance between the two conductors (in farads per unit length), and formula_9 is the speed of light in vacuum.

===Optical wave===
VF equals the reciprocal of the refractive index formula_10 of the medium, usually optical fiber.

:formula_11

<doc id="1072521" wikidata="Q5504806" url="?curid=1072521" title="Frito Bandito">
<text>The Frito Bandito was the cartoon mascot for Fritos corn chips from 1967 to 1971. The Bandito was created by the Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Agency and animated by Tex Avery. The character was voiced by Mel Blanc, who used an exaggerated Mexican accent resembling that of Speedy Gonzales, another of his characters. The Frito Bandito spoke broken English and robbed people of their Fritos corn chips, a reference to the &quot;Mexican bandit&quot; stereotype in Western movies.

Pressure from the National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee and others prompted an update to the character; his gold tooth and stubble were eliminated and his hair combed. The character was retired in 1971. He was replaced by the Muncha Bunch, a group of cowboys, and W.C. Fritos, a character modeled after comedian W.C. Fields.

==History==

The Frito Bandito character was developed by the advertising firm Foote, Cone &amp; Belding and launched by Frito-Lay in 1967. Actor Mel Blanc provided the character&#x27;s voice, while the animation was directed by Tex Avery at Cascade Studios in California. The character was a stereotypical Mexican Revolutionary with a sombrero, handlebar moustache and thick accent consistent with images of Pancho Villa. He carried two pistols and robbed people of their Fritos corn chips at gunpoint. The Frito Bandito was originally featured in commercials that aired during children&#x27;s television shows, but due to the character&#x27;s popularity, Frito-Lay soon began using the Bandito in all print and television advertising.

Frito-Lay was one of several American companies that featured Mexican revolutionaries in its advertising during the late 1960s—others included the Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company, the Elgin Watch Company, and American Motors. In 1968, two Mexican-American advocacy groups were founded in opposition to the use of ethnic stereotypes in advertising: the National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee (NMAADC) in Washington, D.C., and the Involvement of Mexican-Americans in Gainful Endeavors (IMAGE) in San Antonio, Texas. The Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee &quot;threatened to file a $610 million defamation lawsuit against the Frito-Lay Corporation, its advertising agency, and the television networks CBS and ABC on behalf of all Mexican Americans&quot; and claimed that the FCC fairness doctrine allowed them a right to &quot;counter-speech&quot; in response to marketing featuring the character. In response from pressure from the groups, Frito-Lay modified the character to appear more friendly. The gold tooth and beard were also removed. Following the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, the Bandito no longer brandished pistols.

Despite the controversy, Frito-Lay stood by the character. The company cited a survey of four cities in California and Texas conducted by Foote, Cone &amp; Belding which found that 85% of Mexican Americans liked the Frito Bandito. In response, IMAGE and NMAADC shifted their protests to local television stations that aired Bandito commercials. In 1969, KPIX and KRON in San Francisco, California and KNBC in Los Angeles became the first stations to ban the character. Groups also lobbied the Federal Communications Commission for free air time to respond to the Frito Bandito under the fairness doctrine.

Frito-Lay introduced a new cartoon mascot in 1969: W.C. Fritos (based on comedian W.C. Fields). By July 1970, the company had stopped airing Bandito commercials in the states of California, Oregon and Washington, replacing them with ads featuring a group of cartoon Euro-American cowboy outlaws known as Muncha Buncha. Frito-Lay ended the Frito Bandito campaign in 1971.

The Frito Bandito campaign included a song sung to the tune of the traditional Mexican song &quot;Cielito Lindo&quot; in sing-along-style:

<doc id="1072522" wikidata="Q15516913" url="?curid=1072522" title="Muriel Newman">
<text>Muriel Newman (born 6 April 1950) is a former New Zealand politician for the ACT New Zealand party. She was a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1996 until 2005, when she was not re-elected.

==Early years==
Newman was born in northern England. She arrived in New Zealand at the age of eight and was raised in Whangārei. She gained a BSc in mathematics from the University of Auckland, and then a Ph.D. in mathematics education from Rutgers University in the United States. After working in the education sector for twenty years, she entered the business world with Michael Hill International, eventually becoming the deputy general manager of the New Zealand operation before being elected to Parliament. She has been a president of the Northland Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Northland Health Board, and member of the Northland Conservation Board.

She is married to Frank Newman, an accountant and former member of the Whangarei District Council.

==Member of Parliament==

Newman was a founding member of the ACT New Zealand party. She was one of its candidates in the 1996 general election, the first election the party contested, and was elected to Parliament as one of ACT&#x27;s eight list MPs. She was re-elected in 1999 and 2002 and was party whip.

In 2004, when Richard Prebble stepped down as ACT&#x27;s leader, Newman stood as a candidate to succeed him; she lost to Rodney Hide, but emerged with the role of deputy leader. She was placed third on ACT&#x27;s party list in the 2005 election, but lost her seat in Parliament, as ACT&#x27;s representation was reduced from nine MPs to only two.

==After Parliament==
After leaving Parliament in 2005, Newman established the New Zealand Centre for Political Debate (since renamed the New Zealand Centre for Political Research), an independent public policy think tank.

<doc id="1072523" wikidata="Q4773652" url="?curid=1072523" title="Anthony W. Ivins">
<text>Anthony Woodward Ivins (September 16, 1852 – September 23, 1934) was an apostle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and was a member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency from 1921 until his death.

==Early life and family ==

Ivins was born in Toms River, New Jersey. When Ivins was still an infant, his parents migrated to Utah Territory. In 1861 they moved in St. George, Utah, as part of the original settling party for that city.

Ivins was a cousin of Heber J. Grant: Ivins&#x27;s mother and Grant&#x27;s mother were sisters, surnamed Ivins, and were distant cousins of Ivins&#x27;s father. In 1878, Ivins married Elizabeth A. Snow, a daughter of Erastus Snow, an apostle; they had nine children. His son Antoine R. Ivins also served as a general authority of the LDS Church.

==Politics and public service==
On his return to St. George from an 1877 mission, Ivins was appointed a constable. He later served on the St. George city council and as a prosecuting attorney for Washington County, Utah. He served as mayor of St. George in the early 1890s and later in the House of Representatives of the territorial legislature. Under his administration the city built a canal to St. George.

After a mission to Mexico City, Ivins served as Mohave County Assessor, as special Indian Agent for the Shivwits band of Southern Paiutes, and as a delegate to the 1895 Utah State Constitutional Convention.

Ivins was an avid member of the Democratic Party.

==Church service==

In 1875, Ivins was part of an exploratory mission that found many sites in New Mexico and Arizona which were later colonized by the Mormons. In 1877, he served a mission to New Mexico, where he focused much of his attention on the Native Americans, but also preached to people of Mexican descent. 

In the years immediately after his marriage, he served as a member of the stake high council in St. George. In 1882, Ivins was called on a mission to Mexico City, where he served for about the next two years. He served as the first stake president in Colonia Juárez, Chihuahua; the Juárez Stake was the first stake in Mexico. Ivins served in this position until his call to the Quorum of the Twelve in 1907.

Ivins was ordained an apostle and joined the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 6, 1907, after the death of George Teasdale. From 1918 to 1921, Ivins was the superintendent of the Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association. In 1921, Ivins was called as second counselor to Heber J. Grant in the First Presidency, and was replaced in the Quorum of the Twelve by Alonzo A. Hinckley. In 1925, Ivins became the first counselor to Grant in the First Presidency, and he served in this position until his death.

==Death==
Ivins died in Salt Lake City of a coronary occlusion. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.
==Honors==
The small city of Ivins, Utah, is named after him. Ivins Mountain, located in Zion National Park, was named after him in 1935. In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum for his contributions to the cattle industry.

<doc id="1072531" wikidata="Q5545112" url="?curid=1072531" title="George Teasdale">
<text>George Teasdale (8 December 1831 – 9 June 1907) was a Mormon missionary and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Teasdale was born in London, England. Teasdale was baptized into the LDS Church on 8 August 1852, after learning about the church from a Mormon co-worker.

In 1853, Teasdale married Emily Emma Brown, a member of the LDS Church. In 1857, Teasdale became a full-time church missionary in England and Scotland. In 1859, he became the supervisor of the missionaries in Scotland. In 1861, Teasdale was released as a missionary and he and his wife emigrated to Utah Territory.

In Utah, Teasdale taught school and was a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In 1868–69, he returned to England as a missionary to help British Latter-day Saints migrate to Utah. His wife died in 1874, after he had fathered seven children by her, five of whom died in infancy. The couple had been monogamous, but after Emily&#x27;s death, he had four more recorded marriages, and possibly as many as 10 more, all without issue. In 1875, he served a mission to Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. He became president of the church&#x27;s Juab Stake.

Teasdale was ordained an apostle on 16 October 1882, by church president John Taylor. Future church president, Heber J. Grant, was ordained an apostle on the same date. Teasdale immediately served a six-month mission to the Indian Territory.

As an apostle, Teasdale served another mission for the church from 1887 to 1890 and he preached in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Ireland.

In 1891, Teasdale became president of the church&#x27;s Mexican Mission.

Teasdale died in Salt Lake City at age 75 of an intestinal obstruction. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery in an unmarked grave in his family plot and was succeeded in the Quorum of the Twelve by Anthony W. Ivins.

<text>The RS-68 (Rocket System-68) was a liquid-fuel rocket engine that used liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as propellants in a gas-generator cycle. It was the largest hydrogen-fueled rocket engine ever flown.

Designed and manufactured in the United States by Rocketdyne (later Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne and Aerojet Rocketdyne). Development started in the 1990s with the goal of producing a simpler, less costly, heavy-lift engine for the Delta IV launch system. Two versions of the engine have been produced: the original RS-68 and the improved RS-68A. A third version, the RS-68B, was planned for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s (NASA) Ares V rocket before the cancellation of the rocket and the Constellation Program in 2010.

== Design and development ==
One of the main goals of the RS-68 program was to produce a simple engine that would be cost-effective when used for a single launch. To achieve this, the RS-68 has 80% fewer parts than the multi-launch RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). The adverse consequences of this simplicity were a significantly lower thrust-to-weight ratio and a 10% lower specific impulse compared to the SSME. The benefit of this simplicity is the RS-68&#x27;s reduced construction cost.

The RS-68 was developed at Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power, located in Canoga Park, Los Angeles, California, where the SSME was manufactured. It was designed to power the Delta IV Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). The initial development engines were assembled at the nearby Santa Susana Field Laboratory where the Saturn V&#x27;s Rocketdyne F-1 engines were developed and tested for the Apollo missions to the Moon. The initial testing of the RS-68 occurred at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Edwards Air Force Base, California, and later at NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center. The RS-68 was certified in December 2001 for use on Delta IV rockets.

An RS-68 was part of each Delta IV Common Booster Core. The largest of the launch vehicles, the Delta IV Heavy, used three CBCs mounted together.

The engine produced in a vacuum and at sea level. The engine&#x27;s mass was . With this thrust, the engine had a thrust-to-weight ratio of 51.2 and a specific impulse of in a vacuum and at sea level. The RS-68 was gimbaled hydraulically and was capable of throttling between 58% and 102% thrust.

The RS-68A is an updated version of the RS-68, with increased specific impulse and thrust (to over at sea level). The first launch on 29 June 2012, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station used three RS-68A engines mounted in a Delta IV Heavy rocket.

The RS-68 was retired as of the last Delta IV Heavy flight in April 2024.

=== Proposed uses ===
In 2006, NASA announced an intention to use five RS-68 engines instead of SSMEs on the planned Ares V. NASA chose the RS-68 because of its lower cost, about $20 million per engine including the cost of NASA&#x27;s upgrades. The upgrades included a different ablative nozzle to accommodate a longer burn, a shorter start sequence, hardware changes to limit free hydrogen at ignition, and a reduction in the amount of helium used during countdown and flight. Thrust and specific impulse increases would occur under a separate upgrade program for the Delta IV rocket. Later, the Ares V was changed to use six RS-68 engines, designated the RS-68B. Ares V was dropped as part of the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010. NASA&#x27;s current successor heavy-lift vehicle, the Space Launch System, uses four RS-25 engines instead.

=== Human-rating ===
In 2008, it was reported that the RS-68 needed over 200 changes to receive a human-rating certification. NASA has stated that those changes include health monitoring, removal of the fuel-rich environment at liftoff, and improving the robustness of its subsystems.

== Variants ==
* RS-68 is the original version. It produces thrust at sea level.
* RS-68A is an improved version. It produces thrust at sea level and thrust in a vacuum. Its specific impulse in a vacuum is . Certification was completed in April 2011.
* RS-68B was a proposed upgrade to be used in the Ares V launch vehicle for NASA&#x27;s Constellation program. The Ares V was to use six RS-68B engines on a diameter core stage, along with two 5.5-segment solid rocket boosters. It was later determined that the ablative nozzle of the RS-68 was poorly suited to this multi-engine environment, causing reduced engine efficiency and extreme heating at the base of the vehicle.

<text>The black-throated accentor (Prunella atrogularis) is a small passerine bird found in the Ural, Tian Shan and Altai Mountains. It is migratory, wintering in Afghanistan and neighboring countries. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The genus name &quot;Prunella&quot; is from German &quot;Braunelle&quot; - &quot;brown&quot; in diminutive form. The specific &quot;atrogularis&quot; is from Latin, meaning &quot;black-throated&quot;; &quot;ater&quot; - &quot;black&quot; and &quot;gular&quot; - &quot;throat&quot;.

There are two recognized subspecies:

* &quot;P. a. atrogularis&quot; - Breeds in the northern and central Ural Mountains of northwestern Russia. Winters in eastern Iran, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, south to Afghanistan and the southwestern Indian subcontinent .
* &quot;P. a. Huttoni&quot; - Breeds in Central Asia, from the Altai Mountains south to the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. In winter it migrate south, to southwest Asia. The name &quot;Huttoni&quot; commemorates the British captain and mamologist Thomas Hutton who served in India and Afghanistan.

== Description ==
This is a dunnock-sized bird, in length. It has a streaked dark brown back, somewhat resembling a house sparrow, but adults have a black crown, face patch and throat, and a white supercilium. The breast is orange, and the belly white with orange stripes. Like other accentors, this species has an insectivore&#x27;s fine pointed bill.

Sexes are similar, but winter birds and juveniles are less contrasted. In particular, the dark throat may be almost absent in young birds.

The call is a fine &quot;ti-ti-ti&quot;, and the song is similar to the dunnock&#x27;s pleasant twittering.

== Ecology ==
The black-throated accentor builds a neat nest low in spruce thickets, laying 3-5 unspotted blue eggs. It winters in scrub or cultivation.

== Status ==
This species is evaluated as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the IUCN Red List, due to its extensive range, stable population trend, and a population size not believed to approach threatened levels.

<text>Val Anthony is an American singer and musician. He was a pianist and cabaret singer at Jilly&#x27;s, a popular New York City night club in the 1960s owned by Jilly Rizzo. Frequent guests included Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. Others, like Liza Minnelli and Marilyn Monroe, also frequented the club.

Sinatra described Anthony as &quot;the finest working saloon singer in New York.&quot; He released several records on the Columbia label in the 1950s, including the double A-side &quot;The Heart of a Fool/The Portuguese Fishermen.&quot; Anthony was a favourite of Sinatra&#x27;s, who once said &quot; This guy sounds more like me than me.&quot;

According to a 2006 article, Val Anthony still plays in the New York clubs. He is good friends with Gary Scott (former frontman for the short-lived rock band Steam, who hit big in 1970 with &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;) and the two jam together occasionally.

<text>A  (; ), also known by the names Napoleon in North America, vanilla slice in the United Kingdom, and custard slice, is a French dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.

Traditionally, a is made up of three layers of puff pastry (), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.

==History==

According to the &quot;Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets&quot;, recipes from 17th century French and 18th century English cookbooks are a precursor to layer cakes.

The earliest mention of the name itself appears in 1733 in an English-language cookbook written by French chef Vincent La Chapelle. The 18th century was served stuffed with jam and marmalade instead of cream.

In French, the first mention of the appears a little later, in 1749, in a cookbook by Menon:

To make a cake, you take puff pastry, make out of it five cakes of equal size, &amp; of the thickness of two coins, in the last one you shall make a hole in the middle in the shape of a Knight&#x27;s cross, regarding the size you will base yourself on the dish that you will use for service, bake them in the oven. When they are baked &amp; cooled, stack them one on the other, the one with the hole on top, &amp; jams between every cake, [sentence unclear, maybe referring to covering all sides with jam] &amp; ice them everywhere with white icing so that they appear to be a single piece; you can embellish it with some red currant jelly, candied lemon skins &amp; pistachio, you serve them on a plate.
The word is not used again in the recipe books of the 18th century. However, under the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, several of the fanciest Parisian pastry shops appear to have sold the cake. During the 19th century, all recipes describe the cake as filled with jam, with the exception of the 1876 recipe by Urbain Dubois, where it is served with Bavarian cream.

According to Alan Davidson in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, the invention of the form (but not of the pastry itself) is usually attributed to Szeged, Hungary, where a caramel-coated is called .

==Composition==
Traditionally, a is made up of three layers of puff pastry and two layers of . The top layer is coated with a sprinkling of powdered sugar. In later variations, the top is glazed with icing, in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) strips, and then combed.

It is often layered with fruits, most commonly strawberry and raspberry.

==Variations==
According to La Varenne, it was earlier called (), referring to the many layers of pastry. Using traditional puff pastry, made with six folds of three layers, it has 729 layers; with some modern recipes it may have as many as 2,048.

In France, the pastry called Napoleon is made with two joined layers of filled with frangipane.

===Argentina and Uruguay===
&quot;Rogel&quot;, a popular cake, the Argentine variant of the French pastry , consists of various layers of puff pastry alternating with layers of dulce de leche and a top glazed with meringue. Rogel is considered a classic, and a wedding cake favourite.

===Australia and New Zealand===
In Australia, a variant of the is usually known as the vanilla slice. It is made using a gelatin-set , and in many cases, passionfruit icing. &quot;French Vanilla slice&quot; refers to a similar product without fondant icing. In New Zealand, it is variously known as a custard slice, a custard square, a vanilla slice, or, with passion-fruit icing, a passion-fruit slice.

===Balkan countries===

A similar local variety is called in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, or in Slovenia and Croatia, and in Slovakia.

===Belgium and the Netherlands===

In Belgium and the Netherlands, the or is the equivalent pastry. Several variations exist in Belgium, but in the Netherlands it has achieved an almost iconic status, with very little variation seen in form, size, ingredients and colour (always two layers of pastry, nearly always pink glazing, but orange around national festivities). The cartoon character &quot;Tom Puss&quot; by Marten Toonder is named after the .

===Canada===
In Canada, is often named among French speakers, and &quot;Napoleon slice&quot; in English-speaking Canada. It is sold with either custard, whipped cream, or both between three layers of puff pastry; almond paste is the most common filling. A French Canadian method of making a uses graham crackers instead of puff pastry, with pudding replacing the custard layer.

===German varieties===
In the German-speaking part of Switzerland and also in Austria, it is called . In Israel it is known by a variation of that name, ().

===Greece===
In Greece, the pastry is called , a transcription of the word using the Greek alphabet. The filling between the layers is cream whereas whipped cream (a vanilla-infused French Chantilly) is used at the top of the pastry.

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong, the (, &quot;Napoleon&quot;) is layered with buttercream, meringue and walnuts. In Mainland China, a similar product also marketed as a Napoleon (, or more commonly, ) varies between regions and individual bakeries, but usually features a top and bottom layer of rough puff pastry, typically made with vegetable shortening rather than butter, and a sponge cake and artificial buttercream filling.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, it is called . One version, the (French Napoleon), is topped with whipped cream and caramel fondant.

===Italy===

In Italy, the is known as the and contains similar fillings. Another important distinction of the Italian variety is that it often consists of a layer of puff pastry with layers of sponge cake as well (e.g. from bottom to top, puff pastry, sponge cake strawberries and cream and then puff pastry).

===Iran===
In Iran, the pastry is called (, literally &quot;Napoleonic sweet pastry&quot;). It consists of thin puff pastry and often topped with powdered sugar.

===Lithuania===
In Lithuanian tradition, Napoleon or . In Lithuanian recipe pastry has layers of fruit filling such as wild cranberries jam and crème pâtissière. Sometimes is associated with weddings or celebrations.

===Morocco===
In Morocco, are consumed regularly and are known by their French name.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, they are called ( , ; in the singular), and are made of two to three layers, with pastry cream or white custard as filling, topped with sugar glaze. It is a popular specialty on Negros Island, especially in Silay City, and can be bought as by many who visit the island.

===Poland===

In Poland, the local variant of the pastry is officially called , and less commonly . It consists of two layers of pastry separated by a thick cream layer. The whole pastry is then covered with powdered sugar.

===Portugal===
Similar to other European countries, in Portugal the French variation is known as (a direct translation of the French) in the Lisbon region, and as (a transliteration of Napoleon&#x27;s name) in the centre and north of Portugal. Conversely, in the north, the Russian variant is known as &quot;mil-folhas&quot;, which in the Lisbon region is usually called (with the meaning of &#x27;Russian&#x27;) or possibly &quot;russo folhado&quot; (&#x27;Russian pastry&#x27;). Both types are common across coffee shops, tea houses, and patisseries in Portugal; the French &quot;mille-feuille&quot; is even found on some supermarket chains, produced industrially and either individually packaged or as a set.

While the recipe for the Portuguese variant is very consistent with the original French one, both in look, flavour, and size, there are two additional alternatives. The first is just a bigger version of the &quot;mille-feuille&quot;, with additional layers and probably more cream, being commonly 5-7 cm in height. The second alternative (more common in the regular format) is to tint the white icing sugar with egg gems, thus making it yellow in appearance, but also with the traditional chocolate marble effect. Finally, some places can also offer under the same name a few minor changes, such as a glazed caramel top, slices of almonds, or replacing the puff cream with jam, chantilly cream, or even (quince cheese), although these are uncommon.

===Russia===
In Russian literature, a cake named Napoleon () is first mentioned as early as in the first half of the 19th century. Alexander Bestuzhev explained the emergence of such names by the romantic and historicist spirit of that time. The cake has enjoyed an especially great popularity since the centenary celebration of the Russian victory over Napoleon in the Patriotic War of 1812. During the celebrations in 1912, triangular-shape pastries were sold resembling the bicorne. The many layers of the cake symbolized La Grande Armée. In fact, the Russian &quot;Napoleon&quot; is an old recipe that was revisited in 1925 by the pastry chef Adrien Artigarrède. He added almonds from Crimea and icing sugar on the top (symbolizing the snows of Russia, once so helpful to Russians in their defeat of Napoleon).

<doc id="1072545" wikidata="Q5694093" url="?curid=1072545" title="Heather Roy">
<text>Heather Roy (born 5 March 1964) is a former New Zealand politician. She was a Member of Parliament for ACT New Zealand from 2002 until 2011.

Roy was the deputy leader of ACT New Zealand from 17 September 2005 to 17 August 2010. She was also Minister of Consumer Affairs in the John Key-led National Government from 19 November 2008 until 17 August 2010.

==Early life, career and family==
Roy grew up in Palmerston, Otago as the eldest of six children. She was the deputy head girl and, later, head girl at her secondary school. She studied for a diploma in physiotherapy at Otago Polytechnic. She was introduced to politics in 1984 at the age of 20 when she met her husband Duncan Roy, who at that time was the New Zealand Party candidate for Awarua. The Roys have five children.

Before entering politics, Roy worked as a physiotherapist, medical research co-ordinator, manager of a private kindergarten and as publicity officer for the New Zealand Portrait Gallery. In 2006, she completed basic and corps training as a reserve forces field engineer (Royal New Zealand Engineers) within the New Zealand Army.

==Member of Parliament==


Roy first contested Parliament as a list-only candidate at the 1999 general election, where she was ranked 10th on the ACT New Zealand list. ACT only won enough support for nine MPs so Roy was unsuccessful.

=== In Opposition ===
At the 2002 general election, she contested the electorate of Ohariu-Belmont, where she finished fifth behind incumbent Peter Dunne. With an improved list position of 9 and ACT holding its support from the previous election, Roy was elected for the first time. In her maiden speech, Roy talked of her &quot;fervent&quot; belief in the liberal ideals of &quot;freedom of market, of mind, and of body&quot;. In her first term, Roy was ACT spokesperson for ACC; arts, culture and heritage; family; health; internal affairs, occupational safety and health; senior citizens; women; and youth. She was also a member of Parliament&#x27;s health select committee.

For the 2005 general election, Roy was placed second on the ACT party list, ahead of its deputy leader Muriel Newman. Roy contested but lost Ohariu-Belmont, and was re-elected on the party list. ACT only secured two positions in Parliament, so Roy became the party&#x27;s deputy leader, whip, and national security spokesperson. For her second term, she served on the social services committee.

In the 2008 election, she contested the electorate of , a seat formerly held by former ACT leader and co-founder Richard Prebble from 1996 to 1999. The seat had been held by Labour since 1999, although the incumbent, Marian Hobbs, was retiring. Roy finished fourth but was re-elected to Parliament on the ACT party list for the third time.

=== Supporting the National-led government ===
In November 2008, National Party leader John Key formed a new government with support from ACT New Zealand and other small parties. As part of the National–ACT agreement, Roy was appointed as Minister of Consumer Affairs, Associate Minister of Defence and Associate Minister of Education. In the latter two roles, Roy commissioned reviews of the New Zealand Defence Force (including a study on voluntary national service) and of special education. She advocated for, without success, the reversal of New Zealand&#x27;s nuclear free policy. She also announced reforms to independent schools, including increased government subsidies to independent schools in 2009. As Minister of Consumer Affairs, Roy launched a &quot;consumer reform&quot; discussion document in June 2010, approved the creation of New Zealand&#x27;s first financial sector consumer dispute resolution schemes, and established new regulations requiring water efficiency labels to be fastened to electrical appliances including washing machines, dishwashers, taps, toilets and showers.

The 2008–2011 term saw dysfunction and disruption in the ACT New Zealand leadership. ACT founder Sir Roger Douglas, with Roy&#x27;s support, was reported as leading unsuccessful moves to remove Epsom MP Rodney Hide as ACT leader in November 2009. At the ACT party conference in March 2010, Roy used her deputy leader&#x27;s speech to criticise the party&#x27;s reliance on Hide and the Epsom electorate. In August 2010, Roy was removed as deputy leader and replaced by John Boscawen. She was also removed as a government minister. In exit press, Roy denied being part of an attempt to replace Hide as leader. Less than twelve months later, in April 2011, Hide was succeeded as leader by Don Brash.

In June 2011, Roy announced she would leave Parliament at the 2011 general election. In her final year in office, she took charge of the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, a private member&#x27;s bill which had been in her name from 2005 to 2008 but was transferred to Sir Roger Douglas when Roy became a minister. The bill proposed to make membership of student associations and unions voluntary and faced strong opposition from student unions. The bill eventually passed its third reading in September 2011.

==Career after politics==
Following the 2011 election, Roy was appointed non-executive board chair of the pharmaceutical lobby group, Medicines NZ. She left the role in early 2018. For a period after leaving Parliament, Roy also resumed her role as a reserve forces field engineer.

Roy has appeared as a political commentator advocating for lowering the 5% threshold for parties to be represented in Parliament and for public opinion polls to be banned during the election voting period.

<doc id="1072553" wikidata="Q6144677" url="?curid=1072553" title="USS Blackfish">
<text>USS &quot;Blackfish&quot; (SS-221), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine in commission from 1942 to 1946, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the blackfish. During World War II, she completed five war patrols in the Atlantic Ocean between October 1942 and July 1943 in waters extending from Dakar, Senegal, to the north of Iceland. She supported the Allied invasion of French North Africa in Operation Torch in November 1942, and is credited with sinking the German &quot;vorpostenboot&quot; V 408 &quot;Haltenbank&quot; off the north coast of Spain in February 1943.

Later in 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; proceeded to the Southwest Pacific. Between 19 October 1943 and 14 August 1945, she completed seven war patrols in an area including the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Yellow Sea. She sank one Japanese cargo ship of 2,087 gross register tons during her Pacific patrols. She completed her twelfth and final war patrol on 14 August 1945.

Decommissioned in 1946, &quot;Blackfish&quot; later served as a non-commissioned training ship for United States Naval Reserve personnel from 1949 to 1955. She was sold for scrapping in 1959.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Blackfish&quot; was laid down on 1 July 1941 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company. She was launched on 18 April 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Ida H. Mel, wife of Captain Henry F. Mel, head of the Navy Purchasing Office in New York City. She was commissioned on 22 July 1942 with Commander Raymond W. Johnson in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
====July–October 1942====
Following her commissioning &quot;Blackfish&quot; spent three months outfitting and training. She completed it in October 1942.

====Atlantic operations====
=====First war patrol=====
Assigned to Submarine Squadron 50 for operations under Commander, Naval Forces, Europe, &quot;Blackfish&quot; — now under the command of Lieutenant Commander J. F. Davidson — departed New England on 19 October 1942 to begin her first war patrol, shaping a course for French West Africa, where she was to conduct reconnaissance patrols off Dakar, Senegal, in support of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. During her voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, she mostly ran submerged during daylight hours. On 5 November 1942, after 17 days in transit, she arrived at her assigned patrol station off Dakar.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; conducted her first full day of reconnaissance on 6 November 1942. During the morning hours, a heavy mist prevented her crew from making any good observations, but by the early afternoon, as visibility improved, the crew managed to take some photographs of the area. On 7 November 1942, &quot;Blackfish&quot; reconnoitered Dakar Point and Gorée Island, noting that at Point Manuel several buildings believed to be part of a naval base were under construction on reclaimed land in the area.

On 8 November 1942, Operation Torch began in earnest with Allied amphibious landings in French Morocco and Algeria. &quot;Blackfish&quot; continued her patrol of the Senegalese coast, on the lookout for Vichy French forces heading for French Morocco. Surface traffic in the area was light and &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s log reported some &quot;doubt&quot; as to whether it was “the best patrol area,” given that “A position south to southwest of Point Manuel offers the best opportunities for observing the harbor but very little chance of successful attack in case ships hug the coast.” The day concluded without &quot;Blackfish&quot; making contact with enemy forces.

&quot;Blackfish&quot;′s patrol proved significantly more eventful on 9 November 1942. While patrolling submerged north of Pointe des Almadies, &quot;Blackfish&quot; sighted a Vichy French convoy of three cargo ships escorted by a destroyer. Once in range, she fired two torpedoes at each cargo ship and then prepared for a potential counterattack by the destroyer. Her torpedoes missed the first cargo ship, which &quot;Blackfish&quot; attributed to her torpedoes suffering a &quot;loss of depth control.&quot; However, her second torpedo struck the second cargo ship, a 7,110-gross register ton vessel, abaft her stack and &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s sound operator reported that the ship&#x27;s screw stopped. Meanwhile, the destroyer sped up and dropped a series of eight depth charges. &quot;Blackfish&quot; dove to and cleared the area to the northwest, running silently.

Following the action on 9 November 1942, &quot;Blackfish&quot; encountered few other particularly exciting events. On 12 November, her crew sighted a small trawler deemed too small for a torpedo attack. On the night of 12 November, she observed a peculiar flashing searchlight on Cape Verde Point that appeared to be making some type of signal. Nothing developed that evening, but on 13 November 1942, &quot;Blackfish&quot; patrolled the area again in case the light was signalling incoming convoys. Unfortunately for &quot;Blackfish&quot;, bad weather developed and visibility became severely limited, and in consequence she nearly collided with a previously undetected ship, which ultimately she did not identify. She dove prior to making contact and narrowly avoided a collision.

On 14 November 1942, &quot;Blackfish&quot; received word that her duty with Task Force 34 had concluded, and she headed for her primary patrol sector in the vicinity of Dakar. She continued her patrol with nothing of import occurring for the remainder of her time there. She eventually headed north, and on 26 November 1942 she rendezvoused with the Royal Navy &quot;Hunt&quot;-class destroyer off The Lizard on the southwest coast of England and then steered toward Scotland. She moored to the dock at Rosneath, Scotland, on 27 November 1942 and began a refit. During her first war patrol, she traveled and expended of fuel oil.

=====Second war patrol=====

Following her refit, &quot;Blackfish&quot; put back to sea, arriving in her patrol area in the Atlantic Ocean north of Spain off Punta de Estaca de Bares for her second war patrol on 27 December 1942. Over the course of about three weeks, she scoured the area in search of enemy activity. She encountered British forces, numerous fishing trawlers, and an occasional Spanish merchant ship, but no enemy forces in the course of her patrol. She returned to Rosneath, mooring there on 18 January 1943, thus ending her second war patrol with little to show for it other an account of a minor episode of laryngitis among her crew, a few photographs, and some intelligence on merchant ships and fishing vessels.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; remained at Rosneath in upkeep status for the rest of January 1943. She underwent minor repairs and established two shore leave periods, which afforded her crew at least five days of leave.

=====Third war patrol=====

On 1 February 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; got underway for her third war patrol, bound for a patrol area in the Bay of Biscay near Bilbao, Spain. She departed Rosneath in company with the Royal Navy destroyer and the U.S. submarine . &quot;Shikari&quot; and &quot;Barb&quot; parted company with &quot;Blackfish&quot; on the morning of the 2 February. Over the course of the next several weeks while patrolling in her assigned area, she encountered a daily flurry of Spanish fishing and cargo vessels. On several occasions, she received notification of the passage of the Vichy French ships &quot;Winnetou&quot;, &quot;Livadia&quot;, and &quot;Nordfels&quot; steaming from Bilbao to Bordeaux, France. She was unable to engage any of them owing to an apparent effort by those ships to travel on days of low visibility and exceptionally bad weather conditions.

At 10:50 on 18 February 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; happened upon approximately 30 small fishing boats headed for Bermeo, Spain, and her log noted that the boats appeared to have sighted her. It may have very well been that sighting which prompted the events of the next day. At 17:40 on 19 February 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; observed two small vessels that appeared to be large fishing trawlers traveling in a column which did not display any Spanish colors. &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s commanding officer called the crew to general quarters and initiated an attack approach. The first ship’s small bow made her difficult to make out, and several suspenseful minutes passed. At last, at 17:49, &quot;Blackfish&quot; clearly observed German colors and identified both ships as converted trawler-type submarine tender vessels with guns mounted fore and aft. 

&quot;Blackfish&quot; fired two torpedoes from her bow torpedo tubes at the lead ship, and another two at the second. The second of the vessels, the disguised &quot;Vorpostenboot&quot; (patrol boat) &quot;V 408 Haltenbank&quot;, suffered a fatal hit by one of &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s torpedoes. &quot;Blackfish&quot; immediately was subjected to a depth-charge attack, as well as, according to her log, “something, which sounded like a bomb, but that did not produce much shock.” As she dove, five bombs and four depth charges exploded, the third of which reportedly detonated very close aboard and “jarred the ship considerably.” The blast had in fact cracked the conning tower door frame, which caused some minor flooding. &quot;Blackfish&quot; bottomed out in of water, then maintained total silence for a full hour. At 19:18, she cleared the area. &quot;Blackfish&quot; surfaced at 22:20, and her crew made some minor repairs while inspecting her for additional damage. Having taken an account of herself, &quot;Blackfish&quot; sent word of her damage and then continued her patrol.

Early on the morning of 20 February 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; received orders to return from patrol. She sped back to port and arrived safely in Falmouth, England, on 22 February 1943. In addition to the action that took place on 19 February, the patrol resulted in &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s keen observation that, according to her patrol report, “the traffic of Spanish ships east of Bilbao appears excessive considering that Pasajes is the only Spanish port. Although the ships are covered with Spanish flags and cruise very close inshore, it is almost certain that some are enemy ships, and that all of them are not going to Pasajes but are bound for some French port.”

Shortly after her return to England, &quot;Blackfish&quot; proceeded to the Royal Naval Dockyard at Devonport, England. She underwent repairs and testing there from 5 March to 4 April 1943.

=====Fourth war patrol=====

At 09:00 on 5 April 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; got underway for her fourth war patrol and headed for the waters of Inchmarnock at the northern end of the Sound of Bute in the Firth of Clyde on the coast of Scotland to perform practice approaches with the British patrol yacht . Gale-force winds, rain, and poor visibility hindered all training efforts, and by 15:00 &quot;Blackfish&quot; had shaped a new course, proceeding in company with the former French Navy minesweeper to Muckle Flugga in the Shetland Islands. On 7 April 1943 she parted company with &quot;La Capricieuse&quot; and made for the waters of Norway and Iceland. 

Overall, the patrol was uneventful with the exception of some environmental challenges. With air temperatures remaining between , a buildup of ice on &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s hull presented one of the more significant challenges of the voyage. In one instance the ice slowed her diving time by approximately two minutes while she tried to avoid an unidentified airplane.

On 14 April 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; believed she sighted a periscope roughly off her port bow, but a subsequent search revealed nothing. It was the first of several sightings that likely were false as, according to &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s log, &quot;a certain amount of wreckage has been sighted from time to time and a piece of this may have been mistaken for a periscope.&quot; The crew also spotted some mines and observed a few airplanes, most of which were friendly, but ultimately, encountered no enemy ships.

Due to &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s position so far to the north and given the season, the consequent continual daylight made it possible &quot;Blackfish&quot; to conduct much of the patrol on the surface, and her crew believed that access to fresh air while surfaced made for better living conditions. In his reflections on the patrol Lieutenant Commander Davidson observed that &quot;the excessive smoking and steaming of the main engines in cold weather is a very serious military hazard and an immediate remedy is considered vital.&quot; On 11 May 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; anchored at Lerwick, Scotland, and at 10:00 on 12 May again got underway. In short order she joined &quot;Barb&quot; and &quot;La Capricieuse&quot;, and the three vessels headed for Rosneath in company. &quot;Blackfish&quot; anchored at Rosneath on 14 May 1943, concluding her fourth war patrol.

=====May–June 1943=====
From 14 May to 8 June 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; remained at Rosneath undergoing upkeep. During that time her crew received nine days of shore leave. On 2 June, she carried out local training, during which she conducted gunnery exercises and approaches with a British S-class submarine. On 3 June 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; returned to Rosneath.

=====Fifth war patrol=====

&quot;Blackfish&quot;′s fifth war patrol began on 8 June 1943 with her departure from Rosneath in company with &quot;Barb&quot; and the British patrol vessel HMS &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;. During the patrol, &quot;Blackfish&quot; spent long hours submerged with no exercise and limited food selection for her crew, which contributed to some illness among the crewmen. She sighted some merchant ships on 4 July 1943. On 5 July she received orders to return to the United States. She moored to Pier 15 at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, on 26 July 1943, concluding her fifth war patrol.

====July–October 1943====
Upon her arrival at Groton, &quot;Blackfish&quot; underwent repairs, during which she replenished her supplies and her crew conducted training for their upcoming deployment to the Pacific for the war with Japan. With her repaits concluded, she set out for Brisbane, Australia. Upon reaching the Panama Canal Zone, she transited the Panama Canal and briefly conducted training in Panama Bay before continuing her journey. She arrived at Brisbane in September 1943 and spent three weeks undergoing a refit there.

====Pacific operations====
=====Sixth war patrol=====
On 19 October 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; set out on her first war patrol in the Pacific and sixth overall, headed for the waters around New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Bismarck Islands. En route to her patrol area, she conducted multiple night radar training exercises on 20 October with her escort, the submarine rescue vessel . The two parted company on 24 October. At 05:13 on 26 October &quot;Blackfish&quot; arrived at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands and moored to an oil barge for fueling. On 27 October 1943, she rejoined her escort and got underway again at 06:00.

While assigned to a scouting line on 3 November 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; was on the surface when she encountered a Japanese convoy of two merchant ships, which her crew estimated at approximately 4,000 to 6,500 gross register tons, escorted by one patrol boat. Because &quot;Blackfish&quot; was patrolling along a scouting line, there was some question as to whether or not she should attack and give away the scouting line′s position to the Japanese. Davidson noted that &quot;after reading and re-reading my orders, I decided I had no choice but to let them go by in order not to disclose the position of the scouting line.&quot; &quot;Blackfish&quot; dove and the convoy passed unharmed. In Davidson′s words, the incident was &quot;pretty hard to take, after five patrols without a legitimate target.&quot;

On 4 November 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; suddenly sighted a large Japanese convoy escorted by several planes. Upon sighting the aircraft, she dove and a depth charge exploded nearby, but she escaped unscathed. On 6 November, she moved to a new patrol line north of Mussau Island in the St Matthias Islands. On 7 November at 11:05, an Imperial Japanese Navy floatplane attacked her and forced her to dive, &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s log noting that the floatplane apparently was &quot;trying to get in a rain squall to work on us at his leisure.&quot; She remained submerged for several hours, over the course of which she heard 14 aircraft bombs and depth charges explode overhead. Davidson later received information that a large Japanese convoy had been moving through the area at the time.

On 11 November 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; stalked a Japanese destroyer, but the submarine attacked first. Each missed opportunity to strike the enemy hit hard at the heart of the crew. After another frustrated attack opportunity on 14 November 1943, Davidson lamented that &quot;a submariner’s dream almost came true. I guess I don’t live right.&quot;

&quot;Blackfish&quot;′s luck turned when she sighted a Japanese convoy on 22 November 1943. She trailed the column of ships and patiently waited to assume a proper attack position. At 11:21, she dove in preparation for an attack. Twenty minutes passed before she suddenly heard several explosions, which her crew believed to be depth charges, and the Japanese convoy changed course and disappeared. The convoy’s escorts had been attacking &quot;Drum&quot;, which was nearby.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; regained contact with the convoy and continued following it into the evening of 22 November 1943. While on the surface at 00:06 on 23 November 1943, she fired a spread of six torpedoes at the 4,500-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;No. 2 Yamato Maru&quot; at . Davidson felt certain that at least three of the torpedoes hit their mark. The attack instantly alerted the escorting submarine chasers, which converged on &quot;Blackfish&quot;. She quickly dove. The convoy’s escorts pursued &quot;Blackfish&quot; for nearly 40 minutes, but in the end she outran them.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; resumed her pursuit of the convoy and sighted its smoke at approximately 11:11 on 23 November 1943. Davidson observed that there was one less ship present in the convoy, which led him to believe that &quot;Blackfish&quot; had in fact sunk one of the cargo ships in the previous attack. &quot;Blackfish&quot; began an attack approach but the escorts detected her some off and forced her to withdraw.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; continued to track the convoy well into 24 November 1943. She reached an attack position at 23:08 on 24 November and launched a spread of six torpedoes at the stern of an unidentified cargo ship in the Japanese column located at . &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew heard five explosions between three and four minutes after firing, but could make no observation of the resulting damage because the convoy’s escorts quickly closed in. They pursued &quot;Blackfish&quot; for a full 30 minutes, but at length she escaped unharmed.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; sighted a Japanese convoy on 26 November 1943 and then shortly thereafter lost track of it in a rain squall. She reacquired the convoy a few hours later, but as she assumed an attack position on the surface, one of the convoy’s submarine chasers attempted to engage her, forcing her to dive. Over the course of several hours &quot;Blackfish&quot; endured a sonar-guided attack by more than 20 depth charges. Davidson observed that &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s rudder was exceedingly loud, and he believed that the Japanese ability to locate &quot;Blackfish&quot; was directly related to her inability to keep quiet. Following a prolonged siege, the Japanese broke off their attack and &quot;Blackfish&quot; resumed her patrol.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; left her patrol area on 28 November 1943. She stopped off at Tulagi for fuel on 1 December 1943, and on 4 December she made contact with her escort aircraft. She then proceeded to Milne Bay on the eastern tip of New Guinea, where she completed her sixth war patrol after 46 days at sea, 32 of them in Japanese-controlled waters. With her crew in high spirits, she underwent a standard two-week refit at Milne Bay.

&quot;Blackfish&quot;′s patrol was deemed &quot;successful&quot; and her crew was authorized to wear the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia. As &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s first war patrol in the Pacific Theater, it served as a learning experience for both her commanding officer and her crew. Although &quot;Blackfish&quot; had attempted both of her primary attacks on Japanese convoys at excessive range, her commanding officer and crew &quot;benefited greatly from the experience and will undoubtedly inflict greater damage to the enemy on the next patrol,&quot; according to a post-patrol assessment of her performance.

During her refit, &quot;Blackfish&quot; had a gun installed forward and her noisy rudder was fixed. Meanwhile, her crew spent two weeks at a military recreation camp on the beach for rest and relaxation, which included, among other things, horseshoes, volleyball, and swimming. During &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s third week at Milne Bay, her crew′s retreat ended, and she began an intensive training program under the supervision of Submarine Division 82.

=====Seventh war patrol=====

Esorted by &quot;Coucal&quot; and in company with the submarine , &quot;Blackfish&quot; set out from Milne Bay on her seventh war patrol on the morning of 25 December 1943. Shortly after conducting some drills on 25 December, it became apparent that her radar needed repairs, which forced &quot;Blackfish&quot; to return to Milne Bay on 26 December. With repairs completed by 19:15 on 26 December, &quot;Blackfish&quot; put back to sea and hurried to rejoin &quot;Redfin&quot; and &quot;Coucal&quot; at Point Mast. On 27 December, &quot;Blackfish&quot; participated in training and drills with &quot;Coucal&quot; and &quot;Redfin&quot;, then at 13:59 the three vessels charted a course for Tulagi. They arrived at Tulagi on 28 December and awaited further orders. For the next several days &quot;Blackfish&quot; patrolled in the local area, occasionally docking at Tulagi. On two separate occasions several U.S. Navy officers came aboard to witness a series of what were called &quot;special radio tests.&quot; On 31 December 1943, &quot;Blackfish&quot; escorted the submarine chaser to Point White, a task she completed without incident.

While conducting regular patrols in her area of the Solomon Islands from 3 to 5 January 1944, &quot;Blackfish&quot; experienced a bout of extremely foul weather which made a noticeable impact on her operations, prompting Davidson to remark that the &quot;swells were the biggest I have seen in this area.&quot; On 5 January, &quot;Blackfish&quot; sighted two Japanese cargo ships, but due to the weather she shortly thereafter lost contact with them. At 12:00 on 6 January, with the weather slightly improving, she detected a Japanese convoy and began tracking it. Approximately an hour later she received a radio call to help the submarine , but &quot;Balao&quot; was roughly away, so Davidson opted to maintain contact with the convoy. &quot;Blackfish&quot; continued to track the convoy through the night, hoping to get a clear shot by daylight.

With the convoy′s smoke in sight, Blackfish dove at 08:40 on 7 January 1944 and prepared to attack. Unfortunately for &quot;Blackfish&quot;, the convoy′s low speed and zigzagging thwarted her attempts at getting a clear shot. As the opportunity faded, Davidson remarked &quot;our last hope was one of the patrolling destroyers, which we managed to close to but without a very good set[-]up because of the constant changes of course and speed.” Given the circumstances, &quot;Blackfish&quot; pulled back. During the early morning hours of 8 January, one of the destroyers in the convoy came within sight again and &quot;Blackfish&quot; turned toward her on the surface and put all four of her diesel engines &quot;on the line&quot; to get into an attack position. A rain squall intervened and obscured the destroyer, however, and no attack developed. As the rain passed, the convoy — consisting of a small tanker of approximately 4,500 gross register tons, two cargo ships of about 4,500 gross register tons, and two destroyers — came into clearer view. Persistent rain caused further sight and sound issues which delayed any chances of an attack. Believing she had the leader of the column in sight and having finally gained a good position as the convoy emerged from the rain, &quot;Blackfish&quot; fired six torpedoes. Anticipating a quick reprisal, she dove to . The Japanese began a depth-charge attack. &quot;Blackfish&quot; survived, but ultimately could not determine if she had made any successful hits against the convoy. After evading the escorts, &quot;Blackfish&quot; resumed her patroll.

Between 9 and 14 January 1944, &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s patrols proved relatively uneventful, but on the evening of 15 January she began tracking a Japanese convoy. Unfortunately for &quot;Blackfish&quot;, her radar went out and the ships disappeared. Nonetheless, Davidson moved to head them off the next day. At midday on 16 January, &quot;Blackfish&quot; sighted smoke and closed in. The convoy appeared to consist of a cargo ship of about 6,000 gross register tons, one small tanker of about 4,500 gross register tons, and an escorting destroyer. &quot;Blackfish&quot; launched an attack, but the convoy’s low speed and zigzag forced Davidson to “fire down the throat&quot; of the cargo ship and then fire &quot;an angle shot from the stern.&quot; &quot;Blackfish&quot; fired all six of her bow tubes, and her second torpedo hit its target; her cfrew heard several explosions. Meanwhile, the Japanese destroyer approached &quot;Blackfish&quot; at high speed. &quot;Blackfish&quot; dove rapidly to escape from the area, but before she departed her crew observed the 2,087-gross register ton &quot;Kaika Maru&quot; rolling over on her starboard side; 27 of the 102 passengers aboard &quot;Kaika Maru&quot; perished in the sea. Davidson believed he sank the other merchant ship as well, but it was in fact only damaged. &quot;Blackfish&quot; weathered a barrage of depth charges that lasted from 16:56 until 20:13. In contemplating the lengthy Japanese counterattack, Davidson observed &quot;I don′t know whether it was a coincidence or not, but every time we made any noise at all the destroyer would drop one or two more on us.” &quot;Blackfish&quot; and her crew endured 43 depth charges in total, but eventually she shook off the pursuing destroyer by heading into a heavy rain squall.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; patrolled from 17 to 23 January 1944 with little to report other than some bad weather. Late on the evening of 24 January she received orders to shape a course for Tulagi, where she arrived at around 05:45 on 28 January, moored, and fueled. That same day, Davidson proceeded to nearby Guadalcanal for a special duty assignment with Commander, Task Force 31. After he returned, a party of six officers and two enlisted men and their equipment embarked and &quot;Blackfish&quot; got underway to Point White. On 30 January, the radar went out again, and the persistent problems with the radar notably shook Davidson’s confidence in the equipment.

While in her patrol zone in the early morning of 3 February 1944, &quot;Blackfish&quot; sighted smoke and subsequently discovered a Japanese convoy consisting of two medium-sized merchant ships, two &quot;Fubuki&quot;-class destroyers, and one other unidentified escort of approximately 1,000 displacement tons. Having assumed a good position around 09:49, &quot;Blackfish&quot; fired a spread of six torpedoes at a distance of and immediately &quot;went deep.&quot; Two of the Japanese escorts began using sonar and dropped some 14 depth charges. Following the attack, &quot;Blackfish&quot; remained submerged throughout the night of 3–4 February 1944, due primarily to the proximity of nearby Japanese air bases.

Patrolling continued without any excitement through 7 February 1944. On 8 February, &quot;Blackfish&quot; arrived at Tulagi. She set out again on 9 February on the last leg of her patrol. On 13 February she sighted Cape Moreton Light, and shortly thereafter on the same day arrived at New Farm Wharf in Brisbane, Australia, ending her 49-day patrol, 31 days of which were spent in a combat area. Despite poor weather, a &quot;groaning&quot; rudder, and numerous leaks, &quot;Blackfish&quot; had managed to attack three Japanese convoys, as well as perform a special mission. The patrol was deemed &quot;successful&quot; and worthy of the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia. At Brisbane, &quot;Blackfish&quot; underwent a two-week refit, during which she had a new SJ radar installed.

=====Eighth war patrol=====

On 22 February, Lieutenant Commander Robert F. Sellars assumed command of &quot;Blackfish&quot;, and on 1 March 1944 she put to sea, commencing her eighth war patrol. She stopped first at Milne Bay from 6 to 9 March, where she conducted training and took on fuel and provisions. Then on 10 March she headed for her patrol area in company with the submarine . She arrived in her patrol area on 17 March 1944.

On 30 March 1944, &quot;Blackfish&quot; encountered a Japanese convoy and her crew manned their battle stations in preparation for an attack. At , she fired a salvo of torpedoes from her port track, intending to sink the 6,700-gross register ton merchant ship &quot;Ryuyo Maru&quot;. Unfortunately for &quot;Blackfish&quot;, the torpedoes passed under &quot;Ryuyo Maru&quot;′s keel. &quot;Blackfish&quot; dove, expecting a depth-charge attack, but the convoy′s escorts did not give chase. Due to a lack of fuel, Sellars decided to break off the attack.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; received orders on 6 April 1944 to proceed to Seeadler Harbor on Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. She arrived there on the 8 April, moored to the port side of the tanker and fueled. The turnaround proved quick, and she put back out to sea at 21:25 the same day. Once back in her patrol area she spotted numerous planes but few ships. &quot;Blackfish&quot; had a close call with her eponym on 12 April, when, according to her log, some “suspicious-looking objects were spotted 7,000 yards [6,400 meters] from the ship,” and a subsequent, investigation revealed that the objects in question were in fact “several large blackfish.”

As April 1944 continued, so did the patrol, with little excitement. On 15 April 1944, &quot;Blackfish&quot; conducted a reconnaissance of Merir in the Palau Islands. A brief investigation observed a Japanese transport plane making signals to the inhabitants of the island but nothing else came of it. Continued patrolling over the course of the next week revealed consistent plane activity but almost no ships in the area. In one briefly exciting moment on 21 April, a plane caught &quot;Blackfish&quot; somewhat off guard and dropped a small bomb on her, but she emerged unscathed. On 26 April 1944, &quot;Blackfish&quot; received orders to perform lifeguard duty for Allied airstrikes, then report to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for lifeguard duty. Accordingly, she departed her patrol area.

While en route to her lifeguard station on 27 April 1944, &quot;Blackfish&quot; encountered a Japanese convoy. The ensuing pursuit resulted in several hours of constant maneuvering. Sellars marveled that although the Japanese ships &quot;can see fairly plainly through the mist,&quot; they did not take notice of &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s presence during the chase. He concluded that they did not have radar, and having gained an advantageous position he gave the order to fire four torpedoes at one of the ships ay an approximate distance of . Following the launch, a large cloud of black smoke appeared over the target. The convoy’s escort and the ship &quot;Blackfish&quot; had targeted then faded out of view. &quot;Blackfish&quot; scoured the waters for nearly an hour but did not locate any of the ships.

Numerous plane sightings over the next several days forced &quot;Blackfish&quot; to remain submerged for long periods of time. On 2 May 1944, she slightly shifted her patrol zone and began searching the waters between Yap and Palau for possible shipping. On 4 May she shifted over to her lifeguard duties, and her log noted with some surprise that &quot;no planes have been sighted since the first day in this area.&quot; On 6 May, &quot;Blackfish&quot; departed the area to proceed to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 19 May 1944, concluding her eighth war patrol. 

&quot;Blackfish&quot;′s eighth patrol was one of the longest made by any submarine during World War II, having lasted a total of 80 days. Despite the prolonged time at sea, the patrol had also produced little damage to Japanese shipping, although &quot;Blackfish&quot; had conducted her lifeguard and reconnaissance missions, and the patrol was deemed &quot;successful&quot; and worthy of the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia. In his patrol report, Sellars observed that &quot;a submarine should not be left on patrol for too long a period. This was brought home to us by the fact that the efficiency of all hands decreases rapidly after the fifty-day period. The lookouts, particularly, involuntarily slacked up, as shown by the bombings from planes, which came from directly overhead,&quot; and furthermore that &quot;the boys were very tired.&quot;

=====May–September 1944=====

After taking on provisions at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Blackfish&quot; departed on 21 May 1944 and arrived at Bethlehem Steel Corporation’s Submarine Repair Base at San Francisco, California, on 27 May. Her crew went ashore for leave while she underwent a three-month overhaul. After its completion, and with 24 new crew members embarked, she set out from San Francisco on 31 August 1944, shaping a course for Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 7 September 1944 and spent several days conducting independent exercises.

=====Ninth war patrol=====

For her ninth war patrol, &quot;Blackfish&quot; operated as part of a submarine wolfpack designated Task Group 17.11. The wolfpack also included the submarines and , with &quot;Shark&quot;′s commanding officer in overall command. &quot;Blackfish&quot; began the patrol on 23 September 1944, departing Pearl Harbor and heading for Saipan in the Mariana Islands in company with &quot;Seadragon&quot; and &quot;Shark&quot;. The three submarines entered the harbor at Saipan on 3 October 1944, and &quot;Blackfish&quot; moored alongside the submarine tender there. Early on the morning of 4 October, the wolfpack set out for its patrol area but quickly encountered several problems. First, a typhoon crossed the wolfpack′s track, then &quot;Shark&quot; began to experience electrical problems. On 5 October, the task group entered the eastern end of the Saipan safety lane, and where &quot;Shark&quot; resolved her electrical issues. The three submarines remained in the area during the night of 5–6 October 1944 to wait out the storm.

The three submarines departed the Saipan safety lane on 6 October 1944 amid force 8 winds and seas. Several times, green water broke over her bridge, causing seawater to flood through her conning tower hatch. Her crew at first bailed out the conning tower with buckets, then rigged a canvas water scoop which directed the water from the lower conning tower hatch into the large drain in the control room deck. &quot;Blackfish&quot; also experienced several 50-degree rolls and a great deal of sea sickness among her crew. The typhoon continued on 7 October, Sellars commenting that the waves “are still mountainous, 50 to 60 feet [15 to 18 meters] with gale winds of 60 to 70 knots [111 to 130 km/h; 69 to 81 mph].&quot; &quot;Blackfish&quot; pressed on and reached her patrol area on the morning of 8 October 1944, at last finding calm seas there.

&quot;Blackfish&quot;′s patrol was quiet until 12 October 1944, when she made contact with a Japanese &quot;Minekaze&quot;-class destroyer. At 22:39, when dead ahead of the destroyer, &quot;Blackfish&quot; fired four torpedoes from her stern tubes. To Sellars’ astonishment, all four missed. Oddly, the attack also did not result in any retaliation from the destroyer. &quot;Blackfish&quot; continued to stalk the destroyer, and just after midnight on 13 October fired at it again. This attack also failed, and moments later &quot;Blackfish&quot; secured from battle stations. Both disgusted and mystified by the misses, Sellars decided it prudent to refrain from &quot;wasting&quot; more torpedoes on the destroyer and &quot;Blackfish&quot; returned to her patrol area empty handed.

On 14 October 1944, about half of &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew became seriously ill when she surfaced, and this problem began to repeat itself every day. Otherwise, five uneventful days followed the failed attack on the destroyer, and on 19 October 1944 &quot;Blackfish&quot; shifted her patrol area, reaching her new area on 20 October. The daily sickening of the crew upon surfacing persisted, and no cause for the condition could be determined; some crewmen speculated that it was from the air, a test of which indicated the presence of only one percent carbon dioxide, well within safety limits. On 21 October 1944, &quot;Shark&quot; and &quot;Seadragon&quot; reported a significant engagement with Japanese ships. &quot;Blackfish&quot; was trailing the action, but upon surfacing more of the crew became sick and Sellars remarked that the &quot;situation is assuming major proportions.&quot; On 22 October, it was determined that 90% of the crew had been sickened, with a number of the cases being quite serious. In addition to the sickened crew, an inordinate amount of radio traffic coming across the frequency — a result of Task Groups 17.11, 17.14, and 17.15 operating in the same area — impaired &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s communications.

By 25 October 1944, a majority of &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew had regained their health, with only a few lingering cases, and &quot;Shark&quot; and &quot;Seadragon&quot; reported that they were out of torpedoes due to the numerous attacks they had executed in the preceding weeks. In &quot;Shark&quot;′s absence, &quot;Blackfish&quot; took temporary command of the task group. Early in the morning of 27 October 1944, she sighted three Japanese destroyers, but unspecified extenuating circumstances prevented her from attacking them. At 18:23 that day, she spotted several other Japanese ships, but poor positioning prevented the contact from developing into an attack, much to the disappointment of Sellars and his crew.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; shifted her patrol area again, heading to an area in the Philippine Sea east of the Batan Islands and northeast of Luzon in the Philippine Islands, where she arrived on 29 October 1944. She spotted a small ship on 30 October, but had no other contacts. On 1 November 1944, she again changed her patrol area, to an area in the South China Sea west of Cape Bojeador, the northwestern tip of Luzon. She sighted Cape Bojeador Lighthouse on 2 November and moved to the east, scouring the coast, but located nothing of interest. On 3 November, the sea was flat and calm and there was a cloudless sky, but still &quot;Blackfish&quot; sighted no ships. Desperate not to &quot;go home empty handed, Sellars requested a five-day extension to the patrol.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; passed between Calayan Island and Dalupiri Island in the Babuyan Islands on 6 November 1944, and while she sighted no ships, she did spot some &quot;campfires and lights in the island hills.&quot; She patrolled without further developments for several more days and a typhoon ravaged the area on 10 November, effectively ended the crew’s hopes of making any attacks before the end of the patrol. With the seas calming on 11 November, &quot;Blackfish&quot; departed her patrol area. She arrived at Saipan on 17 November, took on fuel and supplies there, and then headed for Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where she arrived on 24 November 1944 after suffering from flooding en route.

Upon &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s arrival at Midway Atoll, two empty cans of carbon tetrachloride with loose lids were found on board, which indicated that the sickness that afflicted her crew during her patrol likely resulted from lead poisoning caused by exposure to carbon tetrachloride fumes. Sellars noted in his final report on the patrol that &quot;this again emphasizes the fact that carbon-tetrachloride should not be carried on board submarines.&quot;

As a whole, &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s ninth war patrol was judged ineligible for the award of the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia. Due to the flooding which occurred during her return from patrol, she required a refit at Midway Atoll. After it was completed on 23 December 1944, she conducted training until 29 December 1944.

=====Tenth war patrol=====

&quot;Blackfish&quot; departed Midway Atoll on 1 January 1945 to begin her tenth war patrol, bound for a patrol area in the Luzon-Formosa area in the South China Sea. She undertook the patrol as a unit of Task Group 17.16, a wolfpack nicknamed &quot;Joe’s Jugheads&quot; which also included the submarines and , with &quot;Archerfish&quot;′s commanding officer designated as the wolfpack commander. On 7 January, &quot;Blackfish&quot; made contact with &quot;Batfish&quot;, and the two of them shaped a course for Guam in the Mariana Islands. On 9 January they arrived at Guam, and &quot;Blackfish&quot; moored there to the port side of the submarine tender . On 10 January 1945, with &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s voyage repairs complete and &quot;Archerfish&quot; having joined the group, the three submarines departed Guam for their patrol area. &quot;Blackfish&quot; made landfall at Batan Island in the Philippine Islands north of Luzon on 16 January 1945 amid rough seas and low viability.

On 17 January 1945, a large wave struck &quot;Blackfish&quot;, causing a significant amount of water to pour through her conning tower hatch into her conning tower, but she carried on despite the flooding. On 18 January, she conducted lifeguard duties in the area in support of U.S. airstrikes. In the late afternoon that day, she spotted a Japanese sampan. Sellars considered firing two torpedoes at the sampan, but ultimately decided against it because of the improbability of getting an accurate shot and because he did not want to give away &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s position in the area. While searching for downed aviators on 19 January 1945, &quot;Blackfish&quot; sighted several other small Japanese sailing ships, but Sellars again decided not to attack them because of similar considerations, and because bad weather made a successful attack unlikely.

While &quot;Blackfish&quot; moved through calm seas on 23 January 1945, she sighted a small Japanese vessel. She attempted to open fire on it with her guns at a range of , but the guns misfired. &quot;Blackfish&quot; brought her 20-millimeter guns and .50-caliber machine guns to bear and scored several damaging hits before leaving the area at high speed. During her high-speed withdrawal, her main electric motor burned out, and rough seas over the next several days prevented its repair until 25 January 1945.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; cruised near Hong Kong on 28 January 1945 and spotted numerous junks and small fishing trawlers. Sellars noted that he believed &quot;many of these trawlers and junks may be Chinese in this particular area,&quot; but &quot;the actions of these vessels do not indicate peaceful fishing. They patrol in pairs...fishing seems to be their secondary occupation. Undisputedly they are fishing for the Jap[anese], if fishing at all. We will shoot them all if we can.” During the early morning hours of 30 January 1945, &quot;Blackfish&quot; made an approach on two large sampan-type vessels. At 02:18, she launched two torpedoes, both of which appeared to hit, but no explosions resulted. &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew manned her guns, and at 04:35 trained all of them on the nearest sampan. Although the guns again failed to fire, the 20-millimeter gun and .50-caliber machine guns riddled the sampan, causing its sails to collapse and its masts to fall. &quot;Blackfish&quot; left the sampan in a sinking condition with its decks awash, then shifted her attention to the second sampan, which opened all her sails in the hope of escaping. &quot;Blackfish&quot; closed to and opened fire while circling the sampan, which in desperation attempted to ram &quot;Blackfish&quot;. After 10 minutes of firing the 50-caliber machine guns overheated and the 20-millimeter gun jammed, so &quot;Blackfish&quot; retired from the battle to work on her guns.

On 1 February 1945 &quot;Blackfish&quot; again engaged a group of similar ships. The skirmish began just after moonrise when she approached several sampans and trawlers traveling in pairs. In the ensuing firefight, she sank at least three ships and damaged eight others with , and 50-caliber fire. The sampans retaliated with small arms fire, which had little to no effect on &quot;Blackfish&quot;. During the firefight, &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s radar picked up three large surface vessels approaching, so she quickly vacated the area.

On 2 February 1945, &quot;Blackfish&quot; reported the previous day’s action, then received orders to join another wolfpack also consisting of the submarines and . As of 3 February she was headed for the Luzon Strait. On 4 February, she received word that the sampan she attacked might have been Chinese, to which Sellars responded that he &quot;considered that possibility each time before shooting but with return fire, attempts to ram, regular patrol in pairs, and non-junk-like hulls, the enemy indications overruled.&quot;

&quot;Blackfish&quot; spent the remainder of her time on station patrolling and conducting lifeguard duties. She departed her patrol area in company with &quot;Batfish&quot; on 17 February 1945 and shaped a course for Apra Harbor on Guam. She arrived there on 21 February 1945 and moored to the port side of the submarine tender , ending her patrol. She received credit for sinking the sampans she engaged by gunfire, but the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia was not granted for the patrol. The ship′s final report also congratulated Sellars on his personal completion of 12 war patrols.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; underwent a refit that lasted until 10 March 1945, during which her crew recuperated at Camp Dealey. The crew commenced training on 17 March, and &quot;Blackfish&quot; again was ready for sea by 20 March 1945 with a new air exhaust blower that dramatically improved the air quality aboard her.

=====Eleventh war patrol=====

On 21 March 1945, &quot;Blackfish&quot; stood out of Apra Harbor and shaped a course for the Luzon Strait-Formosa area and the general area of the South China Sea to conduct her eleventh war patrol. She again operated as part of a wolfpack, which also included the submarines , , and . &quot;Tigrone&quot;′s commanding officer served as overall wolfpack commander.

The wolfpack arrived in its patrol area on 26 March 1945. Believing that there was little chance &quot;Blackfish&quot; would encounter targets, Sellars wrote that day that he assumed that the wolfpack would patrol off Batan Island for a few days &quot;looking for a good bombardment spot&quot; and Japanese submarines, since there is nothing else for us to do.&quot; On 27 March, &quot;Blackfish&quot; reconnoitered Batan Island and took photographs. While she was doing so, her galley went up in flames as a result of a deep fryer fire, but her crew contained the fire.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; identified a suitable bombardment target — a Japanese radio tower — on Batan Island on 29 March 1945. She surfaced at 18:04, and just as the sun was setting she closed the shoreline at full speed and opened gunfire from . Her crew observed several direct hits, which threw up earth and debris around the radio tower. Following the attack, &quot;Blackfish&quot; heard and saw nothing of the Japanese on shore, but her sound operator picked up screw noises at a distance and she disengaged.

After another day of uneventful patrolling, &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew on 31 March 1945 observed two Japanese towers with gun emplacements on Pratas Island and decided to bombard them. Her , 20-millimeter, and 50-caliber machine-gun fire devastated the Japanese emplacements. As with the previous attack, the Japanese did not respond. &quot;Blackfish&quot; made a speedy withdrawal after detecting nearby aircraft.

On 2 April 1945, &quot;Blackfish&quot; was patrolling and conducting lifeguard duty near Pratas Reef. Just before 12:00 she sighted several junks. Her crew manned their battle stations, but the small ships were determined to be &quot;friendly.&quot; &quot;Blackfish&quot; moved alongside one of the junks and a hospitable interaction took place with its Chinese crew. The fishermen did not speak English, but &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew exchanged grins with them, and traded bread and canned food to them for a string of squid.

While patrolling in her lifeguard area, &quot;Blackfish&quot; came across several naval mines and attempted to detonate them with .45-caliber (11.43 mm) Thompson submachine gun fire, which proved ineffective. Eventually, she used her 20-millimeter gun to destroy the mines. She also encountered an oil slick accompanied by a smell of diesel fuel, leading Sellars to contemplate the possibility that another submarine was in the area. On 3 April 1945, &quot;Blackfish&quot; encountered more mines in need of disposal, although she later identified one of the supposed mines as an old oil drum.

April 1945 continued with &quot;Blackfish&quot; engaged in routine patrolling and lifeguard duty and little more than sightings of occasional mines, numerous junks, and a few aircraft. She requested permission to venture to different sectors of her patrol area to try to find targets, but these requests were denied. On 22 April, she received orders to end her patrol the next day. Early on the morning of the 24 April, she surfaced near Pratas Reef and shelled a Japanese radio tower on Pratas Island to use up the remainder of her ammunition, scoring at least twenty hits, and leaving the tower in a brown pall of smoke. She then shaped a course for Saipan.

Blackfish arrived in Tanapag Harbor on Saipan on 27 April 1945 and took on of fuel. She got back underway by 10:00 the same day. On 1 May, she set course for Pearl Harbor, which she reached on 10 May, bringing her patrol to an end. The patrol was not deemed worthy of the Submarine Combat Insignia, prompting Sellars to suggest that &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s repeated assignments to an operating area known to U.S. submariners as &quot;Convoy College&quot; was denying her an opportunity to find targets, and that her next patrol should be in what U.S. submariners called the &quot;Empire Area&quot;, closer to the Japanese Home Islands, where targets were more plentiful and &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew would have a chance to earn the insignia.

=====Twelfth war patrol=====
On 14 June 1945, &quot;Blackfish&quot; put to sea from Pearl Harbor to begin her twelfth war patrol, headed for the Nanpō Islands, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea. Once again, her primary mission was lifeguard duty in support of airstrikes. She arrived at Guam on 30 June 1945, and after completing voyage repairs, got back underway for her patrol area on 3 July 1945. She arrived in her patrol zone on 7 July 1945.

&quot;Blackfish&quot; executed her lifeguard duties, exploded naval mines, and conducted occasional reconnaissance, but for the most part July 1945 faded away with little to report. On 3 August 1945, a major storm front moved in and broke with full fury, prompting &quot;Blackfish&quot; to dive to , Sellars noting that he doubted &quot;if we could ride this one out on the surface.&quot; Later that night, the storm′s winds and waves dissipated just as quickly as they had arrived.

A few days after the storm, what Sellars described as &quot;swarms of American planes&quot; headed toward Kogoshima Kaiwan, and &quot;Blackfish&quot; was called upon to rescue several downed aviators. &quot;Blackfish&quot; headed toward the aviators&#x27; position at flank speed. At 16:04 on 5 August 1945, she located and recovered six United States Army Air Forces aviators from the sea, all whom were in good spirits and good health. Word reached &quot;Blackfish&quot; on 6 August 1945 of another downed aviator in a life raft near southeastern Yaku Shima. She searched the area on 7 August, but located only an empty boat. On 8 August, she received a report of a downed plane south of Tsurikaki Light, but she initially received the wrong coordinates, which resulted in a fruitless search, and Sellars remarked that &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s crew very well could have &quot;saved the pilot if they had been given a correct position.&quot;

On 8 August, &quot;Blackfish&quot; bombarded Japanese shore installations on Kasagaki-Shima. On 9 August, she rendezvoused with the submarine and commenced a personnel transfer, taking aboard 17 U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Air Forces personnel who remained aboard &quot;Blackfish&quot; for the duration of her patrol. Shortly after &quot;Blackfish&quot; took aboard the additional personnel, her evaporators failed, resulting in a prohibition of bathing. Several more cramped days at sea passed, but at last &quot;Blackfish&quot; arrived at Guam on 14 August 1945 and moored to the starboard side of the submarine tender , ending the patrol. On 15 August 1945, hostilities with Japan ceased, bringing World War II to an end.

In total &quot;Blackfish&quot;′s twelfth and final war patrol had lasted 60 days, with 33 of them spent on station, 15 devoted to lifeguard duties, and 18 spent conducting offensive patrols. Although she made no attacks on Japanese shipping, she had rescued six U.S. Army Air Forces personnel, and her crew was authorized to wear the Submarine Combat Patrol Insignia.

===Post-World War II===

With a new commanding officer, &quot;Blackfish&quot; departed Guam on 27 August 1945, bound for the United States East Coast. After transiting the Panama Canal and making brief stops at New York City and Camden, New Jersey, she arrived at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, in September 1945. She underwent a pre-inactivation overhaul and was placed in an inactive status at Groton. On 11 May 1946, while still moored there, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve.

In January 1949, &quot;Blackfish&quot; was towed from Groton to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for renovation. On 5 May 1949, she reported for duty at the Naval Reserve Training Center at St. Petersburg, Florida, and began non-commissioned service as a training submarine for United States Naval Reserve personnel. On 2 February 1954, she returned to Naval Submarine Base New London and underwent another inactivation overhaul there. On 19 May 1955, she was placed out of service and berthed with the reserve fleet at New London.

==Disposal==
In July 1955 &quot;Blackfish&quot; was deactivated, and on 1 September 1958 she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. On 4 May 1959 she was sold to Luria Brothers &amp; Company Inc. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for US$53,670.21. She subsequently was scrapped.

<text>Myriophyllum (water milfoil) is a genus of about 69 species of freshwater aquatic plants, with a cosmopolitan distribution. The centre of diversity for &quot;Myriophyllum&quot; is Australia with 43 recognized species (37 endemic).

These submersed aquatic plants are perhaps most commonly recognized for having elongate stems with air canals and whorled leaves that are finely, pinnately divided, but there are many exceptions. For example, the North American species &quot;M&quot;. &quot;tenellum&quot; has alternately arranged scale-like leaves, while many Australian species have small alternate or opposite leaves that lack dissection. The plants are usually heterophyllous; leaves above the water are often stiffer and smaller than the submerged leaves on the same plant and can lack dissection. Species can be monoecious or dioecious. In monoecious species, plants are hermaphrodite, while in dioecious species, plants are either male or female, the flowers are small, 4(2)-parted and usually borne in emergent leaf axils. The &#x27;female&#x27; flowers usually lack petals. The fruit is a schizocarp that splits into four (two) nutlets at maturity.

The fruits and leaves can be an important food source for waterfowl, which are thought to be important for seed and clonal dispersal.

==Invasion and control==

Three species (&quot;M. aquaticum&quot;, &quot;M. heterophyllum&quot; and &quot;M. spicatum&quot;) have aggressively invaded lakes, natural waterways and irrigation canals in North America. The U.S. states most affected have implemented control plans.

The Tennessee Valley Authority detected milfoil in its waters in the 1960s. It discounted milfoil&#x27;s value as a food or feedstock and fought it with chemicals and lowering of water levels. It suggested that water lilies (&quot;Nelumbo lutea&quot;) might deny it sunlight.
The widespread invasive Eurasian water milfoil (&quot;M. spicatum&quot;) is often controlled with herbicide containing diquat dibromide. Control can also be done through careful mechanical management, such as with lake mowers, but this is a fragmenting plant, and the fragments may grow back.

Mechanical management can include the use of a long-reach lake rake or aquatic weed razor blade tool. Using these tools is similar to lawn work. These tools are most effective before seeds set. Infestations can be prevented through the use of a Weed Roller or a LakeMaid. These are automated and unattended machines. Permits may be required by various states.

In 2007, Professor Sallie Sheldon of Middlebury College reported that an aquatic weevil (&quot;Euhrychiopsis lecontei&quot;), which eats nothing but milfoil, was an effective weapon against it.

Since roughly 2000, invasive milfoils have been managed by hand-harvesting. Several organizations in the New England states have undertaken successful lake-wide hand-harvesting management programs. Periodic maintenance is necessary; the species cannot be completely eradicated once established, but it can be reduced to manageable levels. Well-trained divers with proper techniques have effectively controlled milfoil and maintained lakes, such as in the Adirondack Park in Northern New York where chemicals, mechanical harvesters, and other management techniques are banned as disruptive.

== Taxonomy ==

A detailed molecular phylogenetic study enabled the construction of an infrageneric taxonomy but also revealed that another Haloragaceae genus, the monotypic &quot;Meziella&quot; , once thought to be extinct, was embedded within it, leading to its submersion within the former as &quot;Myriophyllum&quot; subgenus &quot;Meziella&quot;. This created three subgenera, further divided into sections and subsections:
;Subgenera (type)
* &quot;Myriophyllum&quot; (&quot;M. spicatum&quot; )
* &quot;Meziella&quot; (&quot;M. trifidum&quot; )
* &quot;Brachytheca&quot; (&quot;M. variifolium&quot; )

<text>JNCO, short for &quot;Judge None Choose One&quot;, is a Los Angeles, California-based clothing company specializing in boys&#x27; and men&#x27;s jeans. 
&quot;JNCO was founded in 1985. The brand gained recognition in the 1990s with its boys&#x27; ultra-wide straight legged denim jeans.

==History==
This street look was popularized throughout the 90s starting in Los Angeles and working its way through the United States. JNCO also manufactures T-shirts, khaki pants and other clothing articles for men and women. Unlike similar California based apparel manufacturers, JNCO manufactured most of its products in the United States, mainly at S.M.J. American Manufacturing Co., a operation also owned by Milo and Jacques Revah.

After JNCOs grew in popularity, store chains such as Kohl&#x27;s, J. C. Penney, Tops and Bottoms, Gadzooks, and Pacific Sunwear began to carry them. In 1998, some schools tried to ban wide leg jeans such as JNCO because they were a tripping hazard and kids were supposedly hiding contraband in the pockets

After peak sales of $186.9 million, sales halved in 1999. In the 2000s, the brothers closed the main factory.

In 2019, original founder Milo Revah announced he had re-acquired the brand and intended to relaunch it alongside his daughter Camilla. This relaunch took place in June of that year, along with a new website.

==Styles==
JNCO jeans were produced in a variety of styles and lines, ranging from ultra-wide jeans with leg openings greater than to more conservatively-cut styles. Some were so large that younger children often had to sit down while putting them on. After reaching the height of its popularity within the subcultures and becoming more mainstream, JNCOs were known for featuring superfluously large back pockets with graffiti-like inspired artwork embroidery that became more cartoonish as the 1990s ended including flaming skulls and the &quot;JNCO Crown&quot; (previously the majority of styles only had a relatively small stylized &quot;J&quot;). Some names of JNCO styles included Mammoths, Crime Scenes, FlameHead (geared for kids and teens), Mad Scientists, Buddha, Tribals and Rhinos, Twin Cannons, and Kangaroos, These styles ranged from 23 inch leg openings up to 50 inch leg openings, leg openings vary from model and embroidery does to, such as Kangaroos, which include a kangaroo with boxing gloves, which is one of the most popular styles

<text>Freddie Scott (April 24, 1933 – June 4, 2007) was an American soul singer and songwriter. His biggest hits were &quot;Hey, Girl&quot;, a top ten US pop hit in 1963, and &quot;Are You Lonely for Me&quot;, a No. 1 hit on the R&amp;B chart in early 1967.

==Life and career==
He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, and sang in his grandmother&#x27;s gospel group, Sally Jones &amp; the Gospel Keyes, touring England with at the age of 12. He studied medicine at the University of Rhode Island and then at Paine College in Augusta, Georgia, but began singing again with the Swanee Quintet Juniors and gave up his medical career.

In 1956, he recorded as a secular singer with the J&amp;S label in New York City, releasing his first solo single &quot;Running Home&quot;. He also wrote the top 10 R&amp;B hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Spinning&quot; for the label&#x27;s duo Johnnie &amp; Joe, and his song &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; was recorded by Ricky Nelson for his 1957 debut album &quot;Ricky&quot;. He was conscripted for the U.S Military, but continued to record for small labels with little success. After leaving the military, he turned to songwriting, joining the Aldon Music publishing company set up by Al Nevins and Don Kirshner in the Brill Building, where he recorded many of his own demos and worked as a record producer with Erma Franklin. He also continued to release his own records, including &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Long Time Dead&quot; for Joy Records (New York) in 1961.

In 1962, he worked with fellow songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King on their song &quot;Hey, Girl&quot;, recording a demo for singer Chuck Jackson. When Jackson failed to come to a recording session, Scott recorded the song, and, when eventually released by the Colpix label some months later, it rose to no. 10 on both the pop and R&amp;B charts. He followed it with a slow version of Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;, which again made the charts. When Colpix collapsed, he moved to Columbia, which tried to market him, with little success. He left Columbia Records in 1965, and moved to the Shout label, a subsidiary of Bert Berns&#x27; Bang Records. There, he recorded Berns&#x27; song &quot;Are You Lonely for Me&quot;, reputedly requiring over 100 takes before it was finished. The record stayed at the top of the R&amp;B charts for four weeks and reached no. 39 on the pop chart.

He followed up with a version of &quot;Cry to Me&quot;, another Berns song that had previously been a hit for Solomon Burke and Betty Harris. Although he continued to have success with R&amp;B chart hits, including &quot;(You) Got What I Need&quot;, written and produced by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, and a version of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Give You None&quot;, his career was affected by Berns&#x27; sudden death at the end of 1967. Scott continued to perform, but spent much of the next two years without a record deal. He eventually signed with the small Elephant V label, before moving on to Probe Records, where he had his last R&amp;B hit in 1970 with a version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released.&quot; He continued to work with his songwriting partner Helen Miller, wrote advertising jingles, and took minor roles as an actor in films, including &quot;Stiletto&quot;. He also recorded in the early 1970s for the Vanguard, Pickwick International and Mainstream labels, and continued to perform concerts.

Scott later worked on the oldies circuit, and released a new album, &quot;Brand New Man&quot;, in 2001. He also performed &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; on the Van Morrison tribute album &quot;Vanthology&quot;, released in 2003. He died in New York City in 2007 at the age of 74.

His 1968 song &quot;(You) Got What I Need&quot; was sampled for the 1989 Biz Markie hit &quot;Just a Friend&quot;. It also was sampled for Ghostface Killah&#x27;s &quot;Save Me Dear&quot; in 2004.

<text>Travel medicine or emporiatrics is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention and management of health problems of international travelers.

==Globalization and travel==
Globalization facilitates the spread of disease and increases the number of travelers who will be exposed to a different health environment. Major content areas of travel medicine include the global epidemiology of health risks to the traveler, vaccinology, malaria prevention, and pre-travel counseling designed to maintain the health of the approximately 600 million international travelers. It has been estimated that about 80 million travelers go annually from developed to developing countries.

==Mortality and morbidity==
Mortality studies indicate that cardiovascular disease accounts for most deaths during travel (50–70%), while injury and accident follow (~25%). Infectious disease accounts for about 2.8–4% of deaths during/from travel. Morbidity studies suggest that about half of people from a developed country who stay one month in a developing country will get sick. Traveler&#x27;s diarrhea is the most common problem encountered.

==Disciplines==
The field of travel medicine encompasses a wide variety of disciplines including epidemiology, infectious disease, public health, tropical medicine, high altitude physiology, travel related obstetrics, psychiatry, occupational medicine, military and migration medicine, and environmental health.

Special itineraries and activities include cruise ship travel, diving, mass gatherings (e.g. the Hajj), and wilderness/remote regions travel.

Travel medicine can primarily be divided into four main topics: prevention (vaccination and travel advice), assistance (dealing with repatriation and medical treatment of travelers), wilderness medicine (e.g. high-altitude medicine, cruise ship medicine, expedition medicine, etc.) and access to health care, provided by travel insurance.

==Focus==
Travel medicine includes pre-travel consultation and evaluation, contingency planning during travel, and post-travel follow-up and care. Information is provided by the WHO that addresses health issues for travelers for each country as well as the specific health risks of air travel itself. Also, the CDC publishes valuable and up-to-date information. Key areas to consider are vaccination and the seven I&#x27;s:

# Insects: repellents, mosquito nets, antimalarial medication
# Ingestions: safety of drinking water, food
# Indiscretion: HIV, sexually transmitted disease
# Injuries: accident avoidance, personal safety, safety around animals
# Immersion: schistosomiasis
# Immunization (pre-travel vaccination)
# Insurance: coverage and services during travel, access to health care

==Specific disease problems==
Yellow fever is endemic to certain areas in Africa and South America. The CDC site delineates the risk areas and provides information about vaccination and preventive steps.

Meningococcal meningitis is endemic in the tropical meningococcal belt of Africa. Vaccination is required for pilgrims going to Mecca. Detailed information is available on the CDC site.

Malaria prevention consists of preventing or reducing exposure to mosquitos by using screened rooms, air-conditioning, and nets, and use of repellents (usually DEET). In addition, chemoprophylaxis is started before travel, during the time of potential exposure, and for four weeks (chloroquine, doxycycline, or mefloquine) or seven days (atovaquone/proguanil or primaquine) after leaving the risk area.

==Medication kit==
The traveler should have a medication kit to provide for necessary and useful medication. Based on circumstances, it should also include malaria prophylaxis, condoms, and medication to combat traveler&#x27;s diarrhea. In addition, a basic first aid kit can be of use.

Studies have shown there are four main medical problems that travellers develop—diarrhoea or gut problems, respiratory problems, wounds and pain. The medical kit should at least address these common things.

Research has also shown that the best treatment for travellers diarrhoea is to take an antibiotic (e.g. ciprofloxacin) plus a stopper (e.g. loperamide). Due to bacterial resistance, different parts of the world require different antibiotics. It is best to consult a travel doctor to sort out the best medical kit for the exact destination and medical history of the person travelling.

<doc id="1072573" wikidata="Q5018902" url="?curid=1072573" title="Hand formula">
<text>In the United States, the Hand formula, also known as the Hand rule, calculus of negligence, or BPL formula, is a conceptual formula created by Judge Learned Hand which describes a process for determining whether a legal duty of care has been breached (see negligence). The original description of the calculus was in &quot;United States v. Carroll Towing Co.&quot;, in which an improperly secured barge had drifted away from a pier and caused damage to several other boats.

== Articulation of the rule ==
Hand stated:

This relationship has been formalized by the law and economics school as such: an act is in breach of the duty of care if:

:formula_1

where &quot;B&quot; is the cost (burden) of taking precautions, and &quot;P&quot; is the probability of loss (&quot;L&quot;). &quot;L&quot; is the gravity of loss. The product of P x L must be a greater amount than B to create a duty of due care for the defendant.

== Rationale ==
The calculus of negligence is based on the Coase theorem. The tort system acts as if, before the injury or damage, a contract had been made between the parties under the assumption that a rational, cost-minimizing individual will not spend money on taking precautions if those precautions are more expensive than the costs of the harm that they prevent. In other words, rather than spending money on safety, the individual will simply allow harm to occur and pay for the costs of that harm, because that will be more cost-efficient than taking precautions. This represents cases where B is greater than PL.

If the harm could be avoided for &quot;less&quot; than the cost of the harm (B is less than PL), then the individual &quot;should&quot; take the precautions, rather than allowing the harm to occur. If precautions were not taken, we find that a legal duty of care has been breached, and we impose liability on the individual to pay for the harm.

This approach, in theory, leads to an optimal allocation of resources; where harm can be cheaply avoided, the legal system requires precautions. Where precautions are prohibitively expensive, it does not. In marginal-cost terms, we require individuals to invest one unit of precautions up until the point that those precautions prevent exactly one unit of harm, and no less.

=== Mathematical rationale ===
The Hand formula attempts to formalize the intuitive notion that when the expected loss formula_2 exceeds the cost of taking precautions, the duty of care has been breached:formula_3To assess the expected loss, statistical methods, such as regression analysis, may be used. A common metric for quantifying losses in the case of work accidents is the present value of lost future earnings and medical costs associated with the accident. In the case when the probability of loss is assumed to be a single number formula_4, and formula_5 is the loss from the event occurring, the familiar form of the Hand formula is recovered. More generally, for continuous outcomes the Hand formula takes form:formula_6where formula_7 is the domain for losses and formula_8 is the probability density function of losses. Assuming that losses are positive, common choices for loss distributions include the gamma, lognormal, and Weibull distributions.

== Criticism ==
Critics point out that term &quot;gravity of loss (L)&quot; is vague, and could entail a wide variety of damages, from a scratched fender to several dead victims. Even then, on top of that, how exactly a juror should determine a value for such a loss is abstract in itself. The speculative nature of the rule also seizes upon how a juror should determine the probability of loss (P).

Additionally, the rule fails to account for possible alternatives, whether it be the use of alternate methods to reach the same outcome, or abandoning the risky activity altogether.

Human teams estimating risk need to guard against judgment errors, cf. absolute probability judgement.

== Use in practice ==
In the U.S., juries, with guidance from the court, decide what particular acts or omissions constitute negligence, so a reference to the standard of ordinary care removes the need to discuss this conceptual formula. Juries are not told this formula but essentially use their common sense to decide what an ordinarily careful person would have done under the circumstances. The Hand formula has less practical value for the lay researcher seeking to understand how the courts actually determine negligence cases in the United States than for the jury instructions used by the courts in the individual states.

Outside legal proceedings, this formula is the core premise of insurance, risk management, quality assurance, information security and privacy practices. It factors into due care and due diligence decisions in business risk. Restrictions exist in the cases where the loss applies to human life or the probability of adverse finding in court cases. One famous case of abuse by industry in recent years related to the Ford Pinto.

Quality assurance techniques extend the use of probability and loss to include uncertainty bounds in each quantity and possible interactions between uncertainty in probability and impact for two purposes. First, to more accurately model customer acceptance and process reliability to produce wanted outcomes. Second, to seek cost effective factors either up or down stream of the event that produce better results at sustainably reduced costs. Example, simply providing a protective rail near a cliff also includes quality manufacture features of the rail as part of the solution. Reasonable signs warning of the risk before persons reach the cliff may actually be more effective in reducing fatalities than the rail itself.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the calculus of negligence is a normative judgement with no formula or rule.

In New South Wales, the test is how a reasonable person (or other standard of care) would respond to the risk in the circumstances considering the &#x27;probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken&#x27; and, &#x27;the likely seriousness of the harm&#x27;, &#x27;the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm&#x27;, and the &#x27;social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm&#x27;. State and Territory legislatures require that the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm be taken into account in determining whether or not a reasonable person would have taken precautions against that risk of harm. For example, in &quot;Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited&quot; the court considered the social utility of holding football matches when determining whether a football club took sufficient precautions to protect spectators from the risk of being struck by fireworks set off as part of the entertainment during a game.

<doc id="1072581" wikidata="Q7726888" url="?curid=1072581" title="The Columbus Citizen-Journal">
<text>The Columbus Citizen-Journal was a daily morning newspaper in Columbus, Ohio published by the Scripps Howard company. It was formed in 1959 by the merger of &quot;The Columbus Citizen&quot; and &quot;The Ohio State Journal&quot;. It shared printing facilities, as well as business, advertising, and circulation staff in a joint operating agreement with &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;. The last paper printed was on December 31, 1985.

==History==

The origins of &quot;The Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot; date back to 1809 when the first printing press in central Ohio was introduced in the town of Worthington by two men from New England. This led to the establishment of the &quot;Worthington Intelligencer&quot; newspaper two years later. The paper&#x27;s operations were moved to nearby Columbus in 1814 after that city became the state&#x27;s new capital. The newspaper was renamed &quot;The Ohio State Journal&quot;, and it became the official mouthpiece of the then-new Republican Party in the late 1850s, guided by its editor and proprietor, James M. Comly. Following Comly&#x27;s military service during the American Civil War, he returned to Columbus and rapidly established the &quot;Journal&quot; as one of the leading newspapers in Ohio. Through his editorials, Comly is considered by many to have been instrumental in helping Rutherford B. Hayes be elected Governor of Ohio and later President of the United States. Comly left the paper in 1872 when he was named to a diplomatic post in Hawaii, but his guidance had firmly established its importance in Ohio politics and news reporting. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, the paper was purchased by the Wolfe family. In 1950, they merged &quot;The Ohio State Journal&quot; with the Dispatch Printing Company.

The rival &quot;Columbus Citizen&quot; had been founded in 1899 as an independent newspaper not affiliated with a political party. In 1959, it was merged by its owner, the E. W. Scripps Company, with &quot;The Ohio State Journal&quot; to form &quot;The Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot;. The &quot;Citizen-Journal&quot;, which was published by Scripps in the morning Monday through Saturday, operated under a &quot;joint operating agreement&quot; with its rival, the afternoon &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;. The &quot;C-J&quot; was editorially separate, but shared the physical printing plant and the distribution and advertising staffs of the &quot;Dispatch&quot;.

After the &quot;Dispatch&quot; decided not to renew the joint operating agreement when it expired, Scripps sold the &quot;Citizen-Journal&quot; to a Bath Township (eastern Ohio) businessman, who stated he intended to publish it past January 1, 1986. However, on December 30, 1985, he gave the &quot;Journal&quot; back to Scripps, which closed the newspaper on December 31, 1985, when the joint operating agreement with Dispatch Printing Company expired. The Dispatch Printing Company moved the &quot;Dispatch&quot; from afternoon publication to morning publication on January 1, 1986.

== Controversy regarding end of circulation ==

The Dispatch Printing Co. and Scripps-Howard, as the Scripps company was known in the mid-1980s, blamed each other for the demise of the &quot;Citizen-Journal&quot;.

Under the 26-year joint operating agreement that the two companies had signed in 1959, both papers were printed on the Dispatch Printing Co. printing presses. The Dispatch Printing Co. collected advertising and circulation revenue, and paid most operating expenses for both papers, while Scripps owned &quot;The Citizen-Journal&quot;&#x27;s circulation lists and independently operated that paper&#x27;s editorial department. More than three years prior to the December 31, 1985 termination of the joint operating agreement, &quot;Dispatch&quot; executives informed Scripps that they did not wish to renew the contract.

Scripps-Howard, a publicly traded company, was at the time one of the largest media conglomerates in the country, and owned 14 newspapers, seven TV stations, nine cable-TV companies, seven radio stations and other media. Circulation at the &quot;Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot; had been on the rise in recent years, and Scripps reported that it was a profitable property for Scripps for most of the 26-year arrangement. Scripps, however, demonstrated a pattern of closing or selling off newspapers that were in difficult competitive positions, rather than invest in them; in the previous three years, Scripps had closed such daily newspapers in Memphis and Cleveland, and subsequently the company has done the same at several other newspapers, including the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; in 1992 following the expiration of its own JOA with the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; (Scripps subsequently sold the rights to the &quot;Press&quot; to &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; parent Block Communications) and the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; of Denver in 2009. In Columbus, after &quot;Dispatch&quot; executives cut off talks in 1982, Scripps-Howard chose to not purchase or build its own presses or to develop its own business operations, and instead sought more talks in an attempt to renew or replace the expiring contract. The Dispatch Printing Co. declined, and even publicly announced, in June 1983, its intentions to sever all ties with Scripps. A late-1985 Scripps strategy to sell the newspaper to independent businessman Nyles V. Reinfeld changed nothing, and &quot;The Columbus Citizen-Journal&quot; was published for the last time on December 31, 1985.

In an ironic twist, after &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; newspaper and other print properties were purchased from the Dispatch Printing Co. by GateHouse Media in mid-2015, it announced that the newspaper&#x27;s newsroom would relocate from the paper&#x27;s former headquarters at 34 S. Third Street in Columbus to a building also purchased by GateHouse at 62 E. Broad Street – a building originally constructed in 1929 as the new home of &quot;The Ohio State Journal&quot;. The move was completed in February 2016.

<doc id="1072598" wikidata="Q2412852" url="?curid=1072598" title="Minarets (California)">
<text>The Minarets are a series of jagged peaks located in the Ritter Range, a sub-range of the Sierra Nevada in the state of California. They are easily viewed from Minaret Summit, which is accessible by auto. Collectively, they form an arête, and are a prominent feature in the Ansel Adams Wilderness which was known as the Minaret Wilderness until it was renamed in honor of Ansel Adams in 1984.

The peaks were named in 1868 by the California Geographical Survey, which reported: &quot;To the south of Mount Ritter are some grand pinnacles of granite, very lofty and apparently inaccessible, to which we gave the name of &#x27;the Minarets.&#x27;&quot;
Seventeen of the Minarets have been given unofficial names, including Michael Minaret, Adams Minaret, Leonard Minaret, and Clyde Minaret. Clyde Minaret, named after Norman Clyde, is the tallest of the spires. The Southeast Face Route of Clyde Minaret is a technical rock climb featured in &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;.

The area is notable for two fatalities:
* Walter A. Starr, Jr., author of &quot;Starr’s Guide to the John Muir Trail and the High Sierra Region&quot;, fell to his death while solo-climbing the northwest face of Michael Minaret in 1933.
* Steve Fossett, an American aviator and adventurer, died in a plane crash near the Minarets in 2007.

<doc id="1072601" wikidata="Q6388479" url="?curid=1072601" title="Ken Shirley">
<text>Kenneth Lex Shirley (born 12 August 1950) is a former New Zealand politician. He was a member of the ACT New Zealand party, although was previously a member and Cabinet minister of the Labour Party.

==Early life==
Shirley was born on 12 August 1950, the son of World War II veteran Wallace Keown Shirley. He was educated at Heretaunga College in Upper Hutt, and went on to study at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1975. He became a resources manager at the Nelson Catchment Board. He and his wife Jenny had two children.

==Member of Parliament==


He joined the Labour Party in 1977 after moving to Richmond. In 1978 he became the secretary of the Tasman electorate committee. A year later he became the secretary of the Tasman campaign committee. When Tasman MP, and former Labour leader, Bill Rowling announced his retirement Shirley contested the nomination to replace him. From a field of seven (including John Blincoe, Annette King and Stephen Rainbow) he was selected as Labour&#x27;s candidate.

Shirley first entered Parliament in the 1984 election, when he stood as the Labour Party candidate in the Tasman electorate. At the time, there was considerable tension in the Labour Party over the policies of the Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas – the policies were based around economic deregulation and free trade, and traditionalists saw them as a betrayal of the party&#x27;s left-wing roots. Shirley aligned himself with the faction that supported Douglas. Shirley was not a member of the faction&#x27;s so-called &quot;Troika&quot; (consisting of Douglas, Richard Prebble, and David Caygill), but was nevertheless a notable supporter of the reforms Douglas promoted.

===Cabinet minister===
Eventually, the Prime Minister, David Lange, fired Douglas as finance minister and then himself resigned. In the re-arrangement that followed, Shirley briefly held Cabinet rank as Minister of Fisheries, Associate Minister of Agriculture, Associate Minister of Forestry, and Associate Minister of Health. He lost these positions when the Labour Party was defeated in the 1990 election. Shirley himself lost his Tasman seat to National&#x27;s Nick Smith, leaving him outside Parliament.

===ACT New Zealand===
When Douglas and his allies created the ACT New Zealand party, Shirley was involved. In ACT&#x27;s first electoral campaign, the 1996 election, Shirley was ranked in third place on the ACT party list, and re-entered Parliament as a list MP.

He has previously served as ACT&#x27;s deputy leader, and in 2004, he was one of four candidates to seek the party&#x27;s leadership after the retirement of Richard Prebble.

On the retirement of Jonathan Hunt, he sought election as Speaker of the House of Representatives, but placed third behind Margaret Wilson and Clem Simich.

He remained a list MP until the 2005 election, in which only two ACT MPs were returned.

==Post-parliamentary career==

In May 2006, Shirley was appointed Executive Director of Organics Aotearoa New Zealand (OANZ), the peak industry body representing the organic sector, which is charged with implementing a strategy to boost New Zealand&#x27;s organic production to $1 billion by 2013.

In July 2007 the Researched Medicines Industry Association, a pharmaceuticals industry group, announced that Shirley was to be their new Chief Executive Officer, an appointment he took up in September 2007.

From July 2010 to 2018, he was the chief executive of the Road Transport Forum (RTF), representing road transport interests.

<doc id="1072605" wikidata="Q5536005" url="?curid=1072605" title="George A. Smith">
<text>George Albert Smith (June 26, 1817 – September 1, 1875) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement. He served in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and as a member of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Smith was a prominent leader in the settlement of many communities in southern Utah, and played a role in the chain of events preceding the Mountain Meadows Massacre on September 11, 1857. The city of St. George, Utah, may have been named after him.

==Childhood==
George A. Smith was born in Potsdam, New York, the son of John Smith and Clarissa Lyman, and was brought up in the Congregational Church. His first cousin was Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. In September 1832, at age 15, George A. Smith was baptized into the Church of Christ, eight months after his parents had been baptized. The following year, John Smith and his family moved to Kirtland, Ohio, the church&#x27;s new headquarters. There George met his cousin, Joseph, for the first time. In 1838, he moved with his parents and a large body of church members to the state of Missouri.

==Church service==
In the spring of 1834, the 16-year-old Smith accompanied a group of Latter Day Saints on a 2000-mile march to Missouri and back to Ohio. This trip, known as Zion&#x27;s Camp, was intended to bring aid to suffering members of the church in Missouri. Smith served as a missionary to the eastern United States, traveling and preaching during the summers of 1835, 1836, and 1837, while attending school each winter.

Smith was ordained a seventy in the priesthood on March 1, 1835, by Joseph Smith. On April 26, 1839, the 21-year-old George A. Smith was ordained an apostle and became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Future church president Wilford Woodruff was ordained an apostle on the same day. The two men replaced former apostles Thomas B. Marsh, who had left the church, and Orson Hyde, who had been disfellowshipped and removed from his position.

After Joseph Smith&#x27;s death and the assumption of church leadership by Brigham Young, George A. Smith traveled to the Salt Lake Valley as a Mormon pioneer with the first company of settlers in 1847. In the winter of 1850, Smith led a company of volunteers to establish a colony in what is now Iron County. The company consisted of 118 individuals and about 30 families; they settled near the Little Salt Lake (today also called Parowan Lake). They arrived at Center Creek, 265 miles from Salt Lake City, on January 13, 1851. Under direction from the General Assembly of the State of Deseret, the group organized the political entity of Iron County and elected Smith as chief justice. During the winter of 1850–51, the settlers constructed a fort enclosing homes, a meeting house, a school, and a watch tower. They named their community Parowan. Smith taught school during the first winter, and later served as a member of Utah&#x27;s territorial legislature.

In 1868, Smith was called to replace Heber C. Kimball as First Counselor in the First Presidency to church president Young. Smith served in this position until his death in 1875. Smith&#x27;s first wife, Bathsheba W. Smith, served as general president of the church&#x27;s Relief Society from 1901 to 1910. A son, John Henry Smith, also served as an apostle and member of the First Presidency. George A. Smith&#x27;s grandson and namesake, George Albert Smith, also became an apostle and later was the church&#x27;s eighth president.

Smith was the eighth official Church Historian and General Church Recorder of the LDS Church from 1854 to 1871. In 1873 he was appointed and sustained as Trustee-in-Trust for the church, an office he held until his death.

==Utah War==
During the hurried series of actions Young and LDS Church leaders initiated on learning of the imminent arrival of U.S. troops into Utah Territory in 1857-8, Smith left Salt Lake City to visit southern Utah communities. Scholars have asserted that Smith&#x27;s tour, speeches, and personal actions contributed to the fear and tension in these communities, and influenced the decision to attack and destroy the Baker–Fancher emigrant train near Mountain Meadows, Utah.

Leaving on August 3, 1857, Smith arrived at Parowan, Utah on August 8, 1857, and on August 15, he set off on a tour of the local military district manned by the Utah militia known as the Nauvoo Legion, led by stake president-Colonel William H. Dame. Although Smith&#x27;s rank in the Legion was simply a private, one Parowan resident understood that part of the purpose of his trip was to represent the church leadership and to organize the regiment, inspect the troops, and provide instructions. During the tour, Smith gave military speeches and counseled Mormons that they should prepare to &quot;touch fire to their homes, and hide themselves in the mountains, and to defend their country to the very last extremity.&quot; Smith instructed church members to stockpile grain, and not to sell it to emigrants or use it for animal feed.

In addition to Parowan, Smith&#x27;s tour included visits to Cedar City and Santa Clara. The group stopped at Mountain Meadows to eat dinner on August 20 with a group of resident missionaries. Smith addressed a group of Indians in Santa Clara, counseling them that &quot;the Americans&quot; were approaching with a large army, and were a threat to the Indians as well as the Mormons. Riding in a wagon afterwards, John D. Lee said he warned Smith that the Indians would likely attack emigrant trains, and that Mormons were anxious to avenge the blood of the prophets, and according to Lee, Smith seemed pleased, and said &quot;he had had a long talk with Major Haight on the same subject.&quot;

Isaac C. Haight, Cedar City stake president, and second in military command under Dame, met with Smith again on August 21. Haight told Smith he had heard reports that 600 troops were already approaching Cedar City from the East, and that if the rumors were true, Haight would have to act without waiting for instructions from Salt Lake City. Smith agreed, and &quot;admired his grit&quot;. Smith later said he was uncomfortable, perhaps &quot;on account of my extreme timidity&quot;, because some of the militia members were eager that &quot;their enemies might come and give them a chance to fight and take vengeance for the cruelties that had been inflicted upon us in the States&quot;, such as the Haun&#x27;s Mill massacre, where 18 Mormons were killed in 1838 in a skirmish with the Missouri militia during the Mormon War.

On the way back to Salt Lake City, Smith was accompanied by a party including Jacob Hamblin of Santa Clara, a newly appointed Mormon missionary to the Natives in the region who also ran a federally funded &quot;Indian farm&quot; next to Mountain Meadows. Also traveling north with the Smith party were several Native chiefs of the southern Utah Territory.

On August 25, 1857, Smith&#x27;s group camped next to the Fancher–Baker party, headed the opposite direction, at Corn Creek, now Kanosh. Smith later said he had no knowledge of the Baker–Fancher party prior to meeting them on the trail. When the Baker–Fancher party inquired about places to stop for water and grazing, Hamblin directed them to Mountain Meadows, near the &quot;Indian farm&quot; there, a regular stopover on the Old Spanish Trail.

==Plural marriage==

Like many other 19th-century Mormon leaders, Smith practiced plural marriage. Known for his somewhat bombastic speaking style, Smith once said, &quot;We breathe the free air, we have the best looking men and handsomest women, and if [non-Mormons] envy us our position, well they may, for they are a poor, narrow-minded, pinch-backed race of men, who chain themselves down to the law of monogamy, and live all their days under the dominion of one wife. They ought to be ashamed of such conduct, and the still fouler channel which flows from their practices; and it is not to be wondered at that they should envy those who so much better understand the social relations.&quot;

In addition to his first wife Bathsheba, Smith married Lucy Smith, Nancy Clement, Sarah Ann Libby, Hannah Maria Libby, Zilpha Stark, and Susan E. West. His wives bore him 20 children, 11 of whom were still living when Smith died.

==Physical characteristics==
Smith was a portly man at and at least . He was humorously known for sometimes removing his wig to wipe his brow while preaching. After seeing Smith remove his hair, glasses, and false teeth, Paiutes gave him the name Non-choko-wicher, or &quot;takes himself apart&quot;.

==Death==
Smith died in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, and was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<doc id="1072606" wikidata="Q7906154" url="?curid=1072606" title="V. O. Key Jr.">
<text>Valdimer Orlando Key Jr. (March 13, 1908 – October 4, 1963) was an American political scientist known for his empirical study of American elections and voting behavior. He taught at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard.

==Early life and education==
V. O. Key was born in Austin, Texas.

When he was 15, his father, a lawyer and land owner, sent him to McMurry College for his last two years of high school and first year of college. He transferred to the University of Texas at Austin (BA, 1929; MA, 1930), and earned his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1934. He completed his dissertation, &quot;The Techniques of Political Graft in the United States&quot; (1934) under Charles E. Merriam&#x27;s direction.

From 1936 to 1938, he served with the Social Science Research Council and the National Resources Planning Board.

==Career==
He taught at UCLA, Johns Hopkins University (1938–49), and Yale University (1949–51) before starting his last professorship at Harvard University in 1951.

During World War II, he worked with his mentor Harold Foote Gosnell at the Bureau of the Budget.

In 1942, Key published the first edition of his very widely used textbook, &quot;Politics, Parties, and Pressure Groups&quot;, in which he emphasized that politics was a contest and the main players were organized interest groups. The book decisively shaped the teaching of political science by introducing realism in analysis of politics, introducing the &quot;interest group&quot; model, and introducing behavioral methods based on statistical analysis of election returns. It went through five editions, the last published posthumously in 1964, but was not further revised by other authors after his death.

His &quot;Southern Politics in State and Nation&quot; (1949) was a microscopic examination, state by state, of Southern politics using interviews and statistics. The book is one of the most influential books on the subject. In &quot;Public Opinion and American Democracy&quot; (1961) he analyzed the link between the changing patterns of public opinion and the governmental system. He opposed the Michigan model that argued voters&#x27; preferences were determined by psychological factors, thereby, in his view, taking most of the politics out of political science.

According to Chandler Davidson, &quot;When &quot;Southern Politics in State and Nation&quot; was published in 1949, Key&#x27;s reputation...was established beyond question. The book was magisterial, a brilliant sweeping survey of eleven southern states that destroyed once and for all the myth of the &#x27;solid South&#x27;&quot;.

Key was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1955 and the American Philosophical Society in 1956.

In his posthumous work, &quot;The Responsible Electorate: Rationality in Presidential Voting 1936–60&quot; (1966), he analyzed public opinion data and electoral returns to show what he believed to be the rationality of voters&#x27; choices as political decisions rather than responses to psychological stimuli. His opening statement to this book famously argued: &quot;The perverse and unorthodox argument of this little book is that voters are not fools&quot;.

Key also refuted the hypothesis that &quot;Southern backwardness&quot; could be attributed to poor whites. Rather, he asserted that a rich oligarchy of &quot;Southern Bourbons&quot; manipulated working class whites, and unified Southern voters to preserve the economic and social order of the time.

Other works by Key include &quot;The Techniques of Political Graft in the United States&quot; (1936), &quot;A Primer of Statistics for Political Scientists&quot; (1954), and &quot;American State Politics: An Introduction&quot; (1956). He pioneered the study of critical elections and served as president of the American Political Science Association in 1958–59.

In October 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the President&#x27;s Commission on Campaign Costs, which reported in 1962.

==Personal life==
Key married Cora Luella Gettys Key on October 27, 1934. Born in Nebraska on October 17, 1898, she attended the University of Nebraska and earned a master&#x27;s degree from its Department of Political and Social Sciences in 1921. After continuing her education at Bryn Mawr College, she received a Doctorate in Political Science from the University of Illinois, where she was a Carnegie Fellow in International Law, in 1925; her dissertation examined &quot;The Effect of Changes of Sovereignty on Nationality&quot;. She then worked at the University of Chicago in the Political Science Department, where she met her future husband, then a graduate student. After their marriage and continuing into the 1950s, Luella Key (she did not use her first name) worked at the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. Her publications include &quot;The Reorganization of State Government in Nebraska&quot; (NE Legislative Reference Bureau, 1922), &quot;The Effect of Changes of Sovereignty on Nationality&quot; (Urbana, IL, 1926) (based on her dissertation), &quot;The Law of Citizenship in the United States&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1934), and &quot;The Administration of Canadian Conditional Grants&quot; (Public Administration Service, 1938). Luella Key died in June 1975. Some of her papers are preserved in the Archives &amp; Special Collections at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Library, and in the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University.

Key died at Beth Israel Hospital in Brookline, Massachusetts.

<doc id="1072636" wikidata="Q11086776" url="?curid=1072636" title="Japanese mahjong scoring rules">
<text>Japanese Mahjong scoring rules are used for Japanese Mahjong, a game for four players common in Japan. The rules were organized in the &quot;Taishō&quot; to Shōwa period as the game became popular. 

The scoring system uses structural criteria as well as bonuses. Player start scores may be set to any value. Usually, it is set to 20,000 to 30,000 points. Scores are counted using sticks of 10,000 points, 5,000 points, 1,000 points and 100 points. A game often ends when all the points of a player are lost, which is a situation called &quot;hakoten&quot;, &quot;dobon&quot;, &quot;buttobi&quot;, etc. However, some settings allow the game to continue, even if a player&#x27;s score dropped below zero.

There are two criteria for determining the winning points: &quot;han&quot; and &quot;fu&quot;, which correspond to a points table. &quot;Han&quot; is the unit for the value of &quot;yaku&quot;, which are particular patterns or conditions of a hand. &quot;Fu&quot; is the value of melds, waits and &quot;going out&quot;. Hands with enough &quot;fu&quot; and/or &quot;han&quot; may be considered limit hands; limit hands use predefined values to determine the winning points.

==Steps of calculation==
The payment to the winner of a hand is calculated as follows:
:1. Counting &quot;han&quot; (飜)
:2. If it is five &quot;han&quot; or more, it is &quot;mangan&quot; (満貫) or more and the calculation of basic points is omitted
:3. Counting &quot;fu&quot; (符)
:4. If it is clear that the &quot;han&quot; and &quot;fu&quot; yield more than &quot;mangan&quot;, the calculation of basic points is omitted
:5. Calculating the basic points based on the &quot;fu&quot; and &quot;han&quot;
:6. Multiplying the basic points depending on whether the winner is the dealer or non-dealer, and whether the hand is won by &quot;tsumo&quot; or &quot;ron&quot;
:7. Adding bonuses based on the number of counters&quot;
:(8. Adjusting the payment by the &quot;wareme&quot; rule)

In the case of a draw, points are transferred according to the &quot;nō-ten bappu&quot; rule. In the event of a penalty, such as claiming a win with an illegal hand, then points are transferred via the &quot;chombo&quot; rule.

===Counting han===
The total number of &quot;han&quot; (飜) of all the kinds of &quot;yaku&quot; (役; winning hand) in the hand is summed up. Each &quot;dora&quot; (ドラ) increases the &quot;han&quot; value of a hand. &quot;Dora&quot; are not regarded as &quot;yaku&quot;, and no hand can be won without a &quot;yaku&quot; even if there are some &quot;dora&quot; tiles.

If there is more than one way to arrange the winning hand, the arrangement with the highest &quot;han&quot; is used. For example, a hand could be either &quot;ryanpeikou&quot; (二盃口) or &quot;chītoitsu&quot; (七対子), but since &quot;ryanpeikou&quot; is three &quot;han&quot; where &quot;chītoitsu&quot; is two &quot;han&quot;, &quot;ryanpeikou&quot; should prevail. Some &quot;yaku&quot; have their &quot;han&quot; value reduced by one if the hand is not closed.

If a hand has five &quot;han&quot; or more, it is always counted by &quot;mangan&quot; (満貫) as a unit and it is not necessary to calculate &quot;fu&quot; (符) or basic points.

===Counting fu===
&quot;Fu&quot; (符) is counted in the order below and then rounded up to the tens. There may be variations of rules for counting it.

[Three &quot;han&quot; with 70 &quot;fu&quot; or more] and [four &quot;han&quot; with 40 &quot;fu&quot; or more] yield more than &quot;mangan&quot; and there is no need to calculate basic points.

# A winning hand is automatically awarded 20 &quot;fu&quot;. This is called &quot;fūtei&quot; (副底).
# Ten &quot;fu&quot; are added if one wins by claiming a discarded tile with a closed hand. This is called &quot;menzen-kafu&quot; (門前加符).
# Add &quot;fu&quot; of the melds and the pair. (See the list below.)
# Add &quot;fu&quot; according to how the waiting was. (See the list below.)
# Add two &quot;fu&quot; if one wins by self-draw. This way of winning is called &quot;tsumo&quot; (自摸, or ツモ). However, if the winning hand includes a &quot;yaku&quot; of no-points hand (&quot;pinfu&quot;, 平和), in most rules the two &quot;fu&quot; are not awarded and the hand is counted as a total of 20 &quot;fu&quot;.
# Winning with &quot;yaku&quot; which include seven pairs (&quot;chītoitsu&quot;, 七対子) is counted as 25 &quot;fu&quot; altogether. The value is not rounded up to the tens. Some rules say seven pairs has 50 &quot;fu&quot; and one &quot;han&quot;, especially in the Kansai region.
# As an exception, if one wins by claiming a discard with an open hand with melds and waits to which no &quot;fu&quot; is awarded, the hand is not 20 &quot;fu&quot; but counted as a total of 30 &quot;fu&quot;. This is the &quot;fu&quot; for an open &quot;pinfu&quot;.

====Fu of melds====
The list for the third step:
====Fu of waits====
The list for the fourth step:
===Calculating basic points===
The basic points of a hand is calculated as follows:

:[ basic points = &quot;fu&quot; × 2(2+&quot;han&quot;) ]

*When a non-dealer (&quot;ko&quot;, 子: child) goes out by self-draw, the dealer (&quot;oya&quot;, 親: parent) pays the winner 2 × basic points, and the other two non-dealers pay the winner 1 × basic points.
*When a non-dealer goes out by discard, the discarding player pays the winner 4 × basic points.
*When the dealer goes out by self-drawn, all the three non-dealers pay the winner 2 × basic points.
*When the dealer goes out by discard, the discarding non-dealer pays the winner 6 × basic points.

The actual points given are rounded up to the nearest 100. Even if the values of &quot;han&quot; and &quot;fu&quot; are the same, the points received for self-draw wins often slightly deviate from those received for discard wins because of rounding.

==Example calculations==
Example 1: The player on the right of the dealer goes out by self-draw. (The dealer&#x27;s wind is always East in Japanese rules.) The winner&#x27;s hand is closed and has a closed triplet (&quot;ankō&quot;) of Souths. The player also has two Whites as the pair (&quot;toitsu&quot;) and the winning tile is a White. The &quot;yaku&quot; are &quot;self-pick&quot; (&quot;menzenchin-tsumo-hō&quot;) and &quot;honor tiles&quot; (&quot;yakuhai&quot;), and they yield a total of two &quot;han&quot;. The sum of &quot;fu&quot; is 20 (&quot;fūtei&quot;) + 8 (a closed triplet of Souths) + 2 (a pair of Whites) + 2 (pair wait) + 2 (self-draw) = 34 &quot;fu&quot;, rounded up to 40 &quot;fu&quot;.

The basic points are thus 40 × 2(2+2) = 640. The dealer pays the winner 640 × 2 = 1,280, rounded up to 1,300 points. The other two non-dealers pay the winner 640, rounded up to 700 points.

Example 2: The same player goes out by the same hand, except this time the winning tile was discarded by the player on the right. The resulting hand has one &quot;han&quot; of &quot;honor tiles&quot;. The number of &quot;fu&quot; is 20 (&quot;fūtei&quot;) + 10 (&quot;ron&quot; with a closed hand) + 8 (a closed triplet of Souths) + 2 (the pair of Whites) + 2 (pair wait) = 42 &quot;fu&quot;, rounded up to 50 &quot;fu&quot;.

The basic point is thus 50 × 2(2+1) = 400. The discarder pays the winner 400 × 4 = 1,600 points. The other two players pay the winner nothing.

===One han 110 fu===
It is possible for a hand to have one &quot;han&quot; with 102 &quot;fu&quot; (rounded up to 110 &quot;fu&quot;) if the rules allow a pair to have four &quot;fu&quot; when it is made of wind tiles that are both the seat wind and the prevailing wind. Some rules consider that such a pair is still worth two &quot;fu&quot;, making the hand have exactly 100 &quot;fu&quot;.

An example of a hand that has one &quot;han&quot; with 110 &quot;fu&quot;.
, closed , closed , winning by a discard .

The hand has &quot;yakuhai&quot; of one &quot;han&quot; with 20 &quot;fu&quot; of &quot;fūtei&quot;, 10 &quot;fu&quot; of &quot;menzen-kafu&quot;, 32 &quot;fu&quot; of &quot;ankan&quot;, 32 &quot;fu&quot; of &quot;ankan&quot;, four &quot;fu&quot; of &quot;minkō&quot;, and four &quot;fu&quot; of &quot;toitsu&quot;. East is both the player&#x27;s seat wind and the round&#x27;s prevailing wind in this case. This is the largest amount of &quot;fu&quot; that a hand with one &quot;han&quot; can have.

==Scoring table==
The method of calculating a winning hand&#x27;s score in mahjong is quite tedious. Instead, hand values are fixed into a scoring table. Expert and professional players have this table memorized and can thus tell the value of a hand at a glance. Each of the table&#x27;s point values is derived from the scoring equation and procedure with each corresponding &quot;han&quot; and &quot;fu&quot; values.

To use the table, simply look up the values that correspond to the &quot;han&quot; and &quot;fu&quot; counts of the hand. The top numbers in each cell indicate the payout from a player who discards a winning tile. The numbers in brackets indicate the payout for each player in the event the winning tile is self-drawn. If the winner is the dealer, each player pays the same amount. If the winner is a non-dealer, then the other two non-dealers pay the smaller number, while the dealer pays the larger number.

The reason why there are no scores in the 1 &quot;han&quot; 20 &quot;fu&quot; cell is that such a hand is impossible. The only 20 fu hands are the no-points hand (&quot;pinfu&quot;, 平和) where the winning tile is self-drawn. However, since a no-points hand must be closed, it makes winning via a self-drawn tile automatically add 1 &quot;han&quot; &quot;yaku&quot; of self pick to the hand. Therefore, a 1 &quot;han&quot; 20 fu hand cannot exist. A seven pairs hand is fixed at 25 fu. Since the hand is always closed, it adds 1 &quot;han&quot; of self pick when won by self-draw.

==Mangan==
When it is clear that a hand reaches basic points of more than 2,000, it is limited to full basic points of 2,000 and called &quot;mangan&quot; (満貫). A hand of five &quot;han&quot; or more is always counted as a multiple of &quot;mangan&quot;. In those cases, there is no need to calculate basic points.

One &quot;han&quot; cannot reach &quot;mangan&quot; because 110 &quot;fu&quot; × 2(2+1) = 880 &lt; 2,000. (With one han, 110 &quot;fu&quot; is the maximum.)

Two &quot;han&quot; cannot reach &quot;mangan&quot; because 110 &quot;fu&quot; × 2(2+2) = 1,760 &lt; 2,000. (With two han, 110 &quot;fu&quot; is also the maximum.)

When a hand has 120 &quot;fu&quot; or more, it always has some &quot;yaku&quot; of three &quot;han&quot; or more.

==Exhaustive draws==
On plenty of occasions, a hand ends with all tiles drawn and the 14 tiles in the dead wall remain. Yet, no player wins the hand. This is the exhaustive draw. In this case, points may be exchanged barring any &quot;tenpai&quot; hands vs &quot;nōten&quot; hands. After each exhaustive draw, the counter increases by one.

===Tenpai===
&quot;Tenpai&quot; (聴牌) means one tile short of a winning hand. To be &quot;tenpai&quot;, a hand does not need any particular &quot;yaku&quot; partly because winning by the last discard is &quot;yaku&quot; itself. When a hand is not &quot;tenpai&quot;, the situation is called &quot;nōten&quot; (ノー聴: &quot;nō&quot; is English &quot;no&quot; and &quot;ten&quot; for &quot;tenpai&quot;).

Players must show their hand to verify that it is &quot;tenpai&quot; when a hand is a draw and if they declared &quot;rīchi&quot; or if they declare &quot;tenpai&quot;. If a hand with &quot;rīchi&quot; declaration is &quot;nōten&quot;, a &quot;chombo&quot; penalty is imposed. In some cases, a player who didn&#x27;t declare &quot;rīchi&quot; can declare &quot;nōten&quot; even when the hand is &quot;tenpai&quot; to keep their hand concealed.

===Point exchange===
Players receive or pay points called &quot;nō-ten bappu&quot; (ノー聴罰符; &quot;fu&quot; of penalty for &quot;nōten&quot;) in the following way when a hand ends in an exhaustive draw: 
* (1) one player is in a state of &quot;tenpai&quot;, the player gets 1,000 points from each of the other three players and receives total of 3,000.
* (2) two players are &quot;tenpai&quot;, they get 1,500 each and the other two players pay 1,500 each.
* (3) three players are &quot;tenpai&quot;, they get 1,000 each and the other player pays 3,000.
* (4) the players are all &quot;tenpai&quot; or all &quot;nōten&quot;, no payment is made.

In most rules when a dealer&#x27;s hand is &quot;nōten&quot;, the dealer changes and the game wind may change. But if it&#x27;s the last hand of the last round, in some rules, a game does not end if the dealer declares &quot;nōten&quot;.

==Counters==
When there are counter sticks (&quot;honba&quot;) on the table, winners get bonus points calculated by multiplying 300 by the number of those counters. &quot;Honba&quot; (本場) is a unit of continuous dealer wins and draws, and to be exact, &quot;hon&quot; (本) is a unit of numbers of some bars and so on, and &quot;ba&quot; (場) means a scene or a situation.

The dealer keeps count of the number of continuous dealer wins and draws by placing point sticks on the table. While point sticks are usually used for scoring, here they are used merely as counters, a visual aid. The initial count is zero. The number of counters increases by one when:
* (1) the dealer wins a hand
* (2) a hand is a draw (&quot;ryūkyoku&quot;, 流局)
* (3) an abortive draw happens.

In the case of (1) or (3), the dealer remains the same. In the case of (2), when the dealer cannot declare &quot;tenpai&quot;, the dealer changes, but the number of counters increases regardless of whether the dealer declares tenpai. In all other cases, namely when only a non-dealer wins, the count is reset to zero.

&quot;Renchan&quot; (連荘) is a situation in which a player successively plays the dealer, and is often only caused by dealer&#x27;s win or &quot;tenpai&quot;; therefore, draws are not always &quot;renchan&quot;. On the other hand, the number of &quot;honba&quot; always increases when a draw or a dealer&#x27;s win occurs. If the dealer changes, it is called &quot;rinchan&quot; (輪荘) instead of &quot;renchan&quot;, and happens for example by their &quot;nōten&quot; in the case of a draw. 

In a state of &quot;n&quot; counters (suppose &quot;n&quot; is a number), when a player wins a hand by self-draw (&quot;tsumo&quot;), the player gets a bonus of &quot;n&quot; × 100 points from each of other three players for a total of &quot;n&quot; × 300, and when a player wins by claiming a discard (&quot;ron&quot;, 栄), the player gets a bonus of &quot;n&quot; × 300 from the discarder.

Example: 
* East round, 4th rotation with 0 counters (東4局0本場). The dealer (East) wins the hand. The seat winds don&#x27;t rotate. Dealer puts 1 counter on the table.
* East round, 4th rotation with 1 counter (東4局1本場). Hand is a draw with the dealer not declaring &quot;tenpai&quot;. The seat winds rotate. The former dealer retrieves the 1 counter and the new dealer places 2 counters.
* South round, 1st rotation with 2 counters (南1局2本場). North wins by &quot;ron&quot; (claiming a discard), getting a bonus of 600 points from the discarder. The seat winds rotate and the former dealer retrieves the 2 counters.
* South round, 2nd rotation with 0 counters (南2局0本場).

Optionally, a rule may restriction of &quot;ryanhan-shibari&quot; (二飜縛り; literally &quot;two-&quot;han&quot; binding&quot;). Here, players must produce hands of two &quot;han&quot; or more from yaku when the honba count surpasses a certain number. Usually, this count is five or more.

==Chombo==
Under the rule of &quot;chombo&quot; (チョンボ, 錯和 or 冲和), a player is given an infraction. Point penalties vary by organizations and/or events. Typically, a player pays a penalty of the same amount as &quot;mangan&quot; to other players in most rules. A non-dealer pays 4,000 to East and 2,000 to the other two players, while a dealer pays 4,000 to each. In other times, &quot;chombo&quot; does not affect the current score of the game; and instead, the penalty is applied at the end of the game. Chombo occurs for any of the following:

* Invalidly claiming a winning hand
* Winning on a discard under the situation of sacred discard (&quot;furiten&quot;)
* Revealing a false &quot;rīchi&quot;, that is, &quot;rīchi&quot; with a hand that is not in the state of &quot;tenpai&quot;
* Closed &quot;kan&quot; after &quot;rīchi&quot; if the &quot;kan&quot; changes the hand structure (in other words a &quot;kan&quot; of a tile after &quot;rīchi&quot; is not allowed if the hand can be interpreted such that the tile is a part of a sequence)
* Having more tiles than allowed (depending on the rules)
* Knocking the wall over so that it cannot be recovered to the way it was before 

In game infractions, such as the false &quot;rīchi&quot; and invalid &quot;kan&quot; after &quot;rīchi&quot;, they are caught only after draws or winning declarations by players who declared the &quot;rīchi&quot;. If other players happen to win the hand, then the infractions are not revealed and therefore made null and void. Any &quot;rīchi&quot; bets are returned to the players after the end of a &quot;chombo&quot; hand.

Other settings for chombo apply point penalties after the game&#x27;s conclusion. This is especially the case under tournament settings. Under this method, players do not benefit with any point gains. Instead, the infracted player solely takes a point deduction. The deduction may be set to any specified number.

==Final points and place==
At the end of the game, the final scores may be calculated. Under casual game settings, this calculation is not necessary. However, under more formal settings, it may be required. This calculation takes the game&#x27;s scores and adjusts them according the setting of &quot;oka&quot; and &quot;uma&quot;, which were predetermined before the game. The calculation for each player is as follows:

 End score = ((End points + Oka - Target)/1000) + Uma

* End score - the final score for the player
* End points - the player&#x27;s points at the end of the final hand
* Oka - the point difference between the target score and the initial score of all players given to the winner
* Target - the target score, or the minimum score needed for a player to be declared first or the winner
* Uma - a set of four numbers applied to each player&#x27;s placement

Point settings may vary but are always determined prior to the beginning of a game. In particular, different mahjong platforms utilize their own settings to uma.

==Optional scoring rules==

===Wareme===
In the optional rule &quot;wareme&quot; (割れ目, ワレメ; fissure, split), the player in front of whom the wall was split to indicate the end of the dead wall, acquires and pays double the normal points. They are doubled after the points for counters are added. It is often especially called &quot;oya-ware&quot; (親割れ; parent&#x27;s &quot;wareme&quot;) when the player is the dealer.

<text>Abraham Owen Woodruff (November 23, 1872 – June 20, 1904) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was also the son of LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff.

Owen Woodruff was born near Salt Lake City, Utah Territory and grew up working on his family&#x27;s farm. Then, as a young man, he attended the Latter Day Saints&#x27; College and obtained a job at the Zion&#x27;s Saving Bank and Trust Company. After serving a mission in Germany, he was ordained an apostle at the relatively young age of 24. In this capacity, he traveled throughout the Intermountain West, Canada, and Mexico, attending stake conferences of the church and identifying areas for potential Mormon colonies. Woodruff played a major role in the establishment of a Latter-day Saint settlement at Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. During one of his trips to Wyoming in 1901, he met and married his second wife, thus practicing plural marriage eleven years after his father issued the 1890 Manifesto that ended polygamy as an official practice of the church. Woodruff contracted smallpox while visiting his second wife in the Mormon colonies in Mexico and died in 1904 at the age of 31.

== Early life ==

On November 23, 1872, Woodruff was born just south of Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, to Wilford Woodruff and Emma Smith Woodruff. He was the sixth of eight children. His mother was the second plural wife of Wilford Woodruff and the niece of Abraham O. Smoot, after whom Woodruff was named. On May 3, 1881, he was baptized a member of the LDS Church. He attended Brigham Young&#x27;s funeral as a child. Woodruff&#x27;s childhood home was a log house on the Woodruff homestead that his father had established after traveling across the Great Plains as a Mormon pioneer. During his young life, Woodruff helped out on the family farm; &quot;he learned to hoe corn, plant and do general farm work.&quot; By the time he was ten, his job was to herd cows. He also sold watercress from Liberty Park in Salt Lake City for pocket money. He spent his free time fishing and hunting. He attended the local public schools and did well in his math classes. When the U.S. Congress passed the Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882, Woodruff&#x27;s father (Wilford Woodruff) went into hiding, seeking to avoid arrest for practicing plural marriage. Then, when Woodruff was fifteen years old, his father became president of the church.

After graduating from the 40th District school, Woodruff attended Latter-day Saints&#x27; College. Here, he studied under James E. Talmage and Karl G. Maeser for five years. Upon completion of his studies in 1891, Woodruff was hired to work at the Zion&#x27;s Saving Bank and Trust Company. He was 18 years old. He worked as a collector before being promoted to assistant bookkeeper.

== Missionary years ==
In 1893, at age 21, Woodruff was called to the Swiss–German Mission. Around this time, his father&#x27;s health had begun to deteriorate, which made Woodruff&#x27;s departure a difficult matter; but his father encouraged him to go, so he left for Europe. He was assigned to preach first in the city of Frankfurt, Germany. At the outset of his mission, he studied the German language with the help of his host family, often for two hours a day. After a few months, he found a few people who wished to be baptized. Woodruff was then moved from Frankfurt to the city of Dresden, where he served as branch president. After preaching in Dresden, his last assignment was in Berlin. Here, Woodruff endured persecution against Latter-day Saint missionaries; the German government had chosen to promulgate &quot;the banishment of the &#x27;Mormon&#x27; Elders&quot; from the country. In order to blend in, Woodruff dressed and acted like a common worker in the country and preached in secret in homes at night, receiving support from local church members. Then, in 1896, he was released from his mission after three years of service.

== Apostle of the LDS Church ==

After his mission, Woodruff returned to work at the Zion&#x27;s Saving Bank and Trust Co., of which he was eventually made director. On June 30, 1896, he married Helen May Winters. Woodruff&#x27;s father performed the sealing ceremony. The following October, during a general conference of the church, he was called by his father as an apostle. He was 24 years old. He and Matthias F. Cowley were ordained to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles after Abraham H. Cannon died and Moses Thatcher was released. Woodruff was the youngest member of the quorum at the time. He was ordained by his father on October 7, 1897 and was tasked with &quot;traveling to various LDS congregations to dedicate buildings, call church leaders, and generally oversee the operations of the church.&quot; Woodruff traveled throughout Utah, Wyoming, Canada, and Mexico in his capacity as apostle.

He attended multiple stake conferences throughout the Intermountain West. He spoke at a stake conference held in Price, Utah, and, according to the &quot;Deseret Evening News,&quot; told the audience that &quot;the Saints in general [were] on the improve.&quot; He then motioned for all the bishops and high councilors to stand up; and when it became obvious that only half of them were in attendance, Woodruff told the crowd that he &quot;wished they [the absent bishops and high councilors] would hand in their resignations.&quot; At another stake conference in Brigham City, Utah, held in the Box Elder Stake Tabernacle, Woodruff spoke on the importance of the Second Coming, preaching the gospel, and marriage. At a stake conference in St. George, Utah, he told attendees of the importance of &quot;improving [their] horses, cattle, sheep and fowls in general.&quot; At a conference of the Granite Stake in 1903, Woodruff quoted Theodore Roosevelt on the value of labor. Woodruff also took part in various additional functions as an apostle: he was present for the celebration of the thirteenth anniversary of the establishment of LDS College and, in 1901, he took part in planning the Brigham Young anniversary celebration.
He was also a member of the general board of the Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association. His wife Helen Woodruff was on the general board of the Young Ladies&#x27; Mutual Improvement Association, so she and her husband often traveled together on church assignments. Of him, Woodruff&#x27;s fellow LDS apostle Matthias F. Cowley wrote: &quot;When appointed to any labor, he works with all his might, mind, and strength, coupled with implicit faith in our eternal Father. He is young, healthy, active and faithful in his high calling and will doubtless accomplish a mighty work in the earth, and live to see the redemption of Zion.&quot; During this time, Woodruff developed a close relationship with his father, Wilford Woodruff, whose health had waned over time. After Wilford Woodruff died in 1898, Owen Woodruff inherited from him two shares in the Zion&#x27;s Savings Bank and Trust Co. Woodruff&#x27;s father also appointed him, along with Asahel Hart, David Patten, Newton Woodruff, and Wilford Woodruff Jr., to compile and publish his biography. He focused much of his efforts as apostle on establishing new LDS settlements outside of Utah Territory.

=== Establishing a Mormon colony at Bighorn Basin, Wyoming ===

Early in the year 1900, Woodruff traveled to the Bighorn River in Wyoming to scout the availability of resources and determine the feasibility of establishing a colony of Latter-day Saints there. In February, he traveled back to Salt Lake City to make his report to church leadership, traveling on the Northern Pacific Railway through Butte, Montana. He stayed with Colonel William F. Cody (also known as Buffalo Bill) in Cody, Wyoming during a bout of cold weather. Once he arrived in Utah, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; reported that &quot;Mr. Woodruff stated that he was delighted with eastern Montana and northern Wyoming, which is peculiarly adapted for Mormon husbandry. He said that he and his colleagues would make a favorable report to the higher officials of the Mormon church&quot;. Additionally, Woodruff told the &quot;Salt Lake Herald-Republican,&quot; &quot;Our people are naturally agriculturalists, industrious and thrifty, and if the Big Horn country is what I am told it is, the colony should prove very successful.&quot; He became president of the Big Horn Basin Colonization Company and encouraged church members to migrate to Bighorn Basin, Wyoming.

Alongside a committee of public and church officials, Woodruff facilitated the purchase of 18,000 acres under the Carey Act on which to establish a new Mormon colony. The Wyoming state government cooperated with Woodruff, who said that the Wyoming representatives gave the committee &quot;every encouragement in this matter&quot;. Land in the basin cost 25 cents per acre for settlers. Preparations for the settlement were finalized in March 1900. Under Woodruff&#x27;s direction, 500 Latter-day Saints settled in Big Horn County, Wyoming in May 1900. He was there to greet them upon arrival. Then, in July 1901, group of Latter-day Saints from Sanpete County, Utah; Ogden, Utah; and Coalville, Utah left for Big Horn as well. One of the settlers&#x27; first projects was the construction of an irrigation system. In 1901 Woodruff was president of the &quot;Wood River Live-stock company,&quot; which focused on fostering the livestock industry in Idaho and Wyoming.

== Post-Manifesto polygamy ==

During one of his trips to Bighorn Basin, Woodruff met Eliza Avery Clark in Star Valley, Wyoming. He married her in 1901 while still married to his first wife, Helen, thus entering into plural marriage 11 years after his father issued the 1890 Manifesto, which ended polygamy as an official practice of the church. Woodruff was not alone in entering into post-Manifesto polygamy; there is evidence that other church leaders did the same, recognizing the Manifesto as the end of practicing plural marriage publicly but not privately. His marriage to Clark was largely kept a secret, and it is unknown if Joseph F. Smith, the church president at the time, gave permission for the union to take place. Of his decision to practice plural marriage, authors Lu Ann Faylor Snyder and Phillip A. Snyder wrote: &quot;Eventually, apparently after much soul-searching, Owen determined to embrace post-Manifesto polygamy because he must have believed that the laws of God would eventually supersede those of the government despite the Manifesto’s promise of the church’s legal compliance.&quot;

Woodruff had four children with Helen Winters Woodruff: a son named Wilford Owen and three daughters named Helen Mar, June, and Rhoda. He had one child with Eliza Clark: a daughter named Ruth, born on April 11, 1904. Clark lived in Colonia Juárez, Chihuahua, a Latter-day Saint colony in Mexico, in order to keep her status as a plural wife a secret. Accompanied by Helen and their children, Woodruff visited Clark in Mexico shortly after the birth of their daughter, Ruth; apparently, &quot;President [Joseph F.] Smith had sent Owen and Helen to Mexico to avoid the threat of arrest and the possibility of testifying in the [Reed] Smoot polygamy trials.&quot; He was included on a 1910 list of known post-Manifesto polygamists, apparently called &quot;Sporadies&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==

While in Mexico, his wife Helen Woodruff contracted smallpox and died on June 7, 1904 after suffering with the disease for three weeks. The couple had been encouraged to be vaccinated against the disease, but Woodruff had opted not to receive the vaccine. After attending Helen&#x27;s funeral in Mexico City, he began to travel back to the US, but stopped in El Paso, Texas when he grew ill. His doctor initially diagnosed the illness as typhoid fever, but it was soon revealed that he had smallpox. Woodruff&#x27;s condition appeared to be improving; he began making preparations to return home to Salt Lake City when his illness worsened. He was kept in an &quot;isolation hospital&quot; in El Paso. Woodruff died on June 20, 1904, at the age of 31 in line with a prophecy given to Owen and Helen Woodruff by President Wilford Woodruff that they &quot;would not be separated in death by more than two weeks.&quot; The &quot;Coalville Times&quot; reported that his &quot;direct cause of death&quot; was &quot;heart failure.&quot;

Memorial services for Abraham Owen and Helen Woodruff were held on June 26, 1904 in the Granite Stake Tabernacle. The &quot;Deseret Evening News&quot; reported that around 1,500 people were in attendance. Francis M. Lyman, Seymour B. Young, Junius F. Wells, Martha H. Tingey, Maria Young Dougall, and J. Golden Kimball participated in the program. W. W. Maughan &quot;read a biographical sketch of Apostle Woodruff.&quot; Woodruff was succeeded by Charles W. Penrose in his office as apostle. Heber J. Grant and his wife took care of Owen and Helen Woodruff&#x27;s four children after their deaths. Their daughter Helen Woodruff Anderson went on to attend the University of Utah and later became a member of the Relief Society General Board. On July 17, 1993, Woodruff&#x27;s body was transported from El Paso to Salt Lake City and was reinterred in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. His wife Helen&#x27;s body was moved from Mexico City to rest beside Woodruff&#x27;s.

Editor and politician S. A. Kenner described Woodruff as possessing &quot;scrupulous honesty, simplicity, implicit faith in God, industry and a total absence of ostentation&quot;. The &quot;Iron County Record&quot; memorialized him as &quot;one of those unostentatious unassuming sort of men who win the hearts of those with whom they come in contact by making them feel perfectly at home in their society, and that although they are called to hold a prominent place in the administration of public affairs, are not the least bit top heavy in consequence.&quot;

<text>Charles William Penrose (February 4, 1832 – May 16, 1925) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1904 to 1911. Penrose was also a member of the First Presidency, serving as a counselor to church presidents Joseph F. Smith and Heber J. Grant from 1911 until his death.

==Life==
Penrose was born in Camberwell London, England. It is said that he learned to read the Bible by the age of four. Penrose was introduced to the LDS Church and baptized at the age of eighteen on May 14, 1850, in London. He also met and married his wife, Lucetta Stratford, in London. The couple had 15 children.

==Mission==
After joining the LDS Church, Penrose was called on a mission, preaching throughout England. It was while on this mission he wrote the hymn &quot;O, Ye Mountains High&quot;. For the next seven years he primarily served as a missionary in agricultural areas. During this first mission he wrote &quot;Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion&quot; as a result of the Utah War. In 1868, Penrose became the president of the church&#x27;s London Conference (equivalent of a modern LDS district). He was then made president of the Cheltenham Pastorate, consisting of multiple conferences. He was then placed in charge of the Birmingham Pastorate, presiding over four conferences in the West Midlands of England.

Penrose wrote a set of mission tracts entitled &quot;Rays of Living Light&quot; which were widely used until about the middle of the 20th-century.

==Utah Territory==
In 1861, Penrose emigrated to Utah Territory. After arriving in Utah he settled in Farmington. The cabin the Penrose family lived at in Farmington is now a museum of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers. Besides working as a farmer and hauling logs, was also a school teacher.

In 1864, Ezra T. Benson convinced Penrose to move to Logan, Utah, where he continued to work as a farmer and school teacher. Penrose was asked to return to England as a missionary in 1865. While on this mission he published several songs and hymns, including &quot;Beautiful Zion for Me&quot;, which was written on the occasion of Brigham Young, Jr. leaving for Utah. For about the first year of his mission he preached to coal workers in Lancashire. For the next two years he was in the office of the Millennial Star and was an assistant to the mission president Franklin D. Richards.

==Farming and retailing==
Upon Penrose&#x27;s return to Utah in 1868, he returned to Logan, where he was involved in farming and retailing. He formed a partnership, and then the Logan Cooperative Mercantile Institution, of which he was secretary-treasurer and bookkeeper. That failed and he ended up leaving Logan. While in Logan, Penrose also served as a member of the LDS stake high council.

==Publishing==
He next settled in Ogden, Utah, on the advice of Franklin D. Richards. Here he became involved in newspaper publishing, publishing the &quot;Ogden Junction&quot;. He also was a prominent public speaker in the community. Penrose also served as a member of the city council in Ogden. When the Weber Stake was organized Penrose was called as a member of the high council.

In 1877, Penrose became the assistant editor of the LDS Church-owned &quot;Deseret News&quot; in Salt Lake City, working under George Q. Cannon. Penrose was known for his writing, including missionary tracts and lyrics of Latter-day Saint hymns, including &quot;God of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;O Ye Mountains High&quot;, and &quot;Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion&quot;. In 1880, Penrose became the editor-in-chief of the Deseret News.

==Delegate==
In 1872 Penrose was a delegate for Weber County, Utah in the state constitutional convention of that year. While the convention wrote a state constitution, this one was rejected by the U.S. congress and Utah did not at that time become a state.

Penrose served in the Utah Territorial Legislature, first being elected from Ogden in 1874. After moving to Salt Lake City, he was again elected to the state legislature in 1879, elected to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Albert P. Rockwood. In 1880, Penrose introduced a bill in the state legislature, largely at the urging of Emmeline B. Wells, that would have allowed women to serve in all public offices in the territory. This bill passed the legislature but was vetoed by the governor of Utah Territory. Penrose served as a member of the Utah State Constitutional Convention of 1882 as well.

In 1884 Penrose was called a counselor to Angus M. Cannon in the presidency of the Salt Lake Stake.

Penrose, along with George Reynolds and John R. Winder, edited the 1890 Manifesto and prepared it for publication after being given the initial text by Wilford Woodruff.

==Professor==
Penrose was a professor of theology at Brigham Young Academy from 1897 to 1899 and again in 1901 and 1902.

Penrose was made a member of the LDS Council of 50 in 1882. An arrest warrant was issued for him on polygamy charges in December 1884. In January 1885 he traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met with Grover Cleveland, among others. Some of these meetings were done jointly with Brigham Young Jr. Penrose then served a mission in England for about six months. He presided over the London Conference, and also worked closely with the mission president, Daniel H. Wells. Penrose preached in all the lands of the United Kingdom, as well as in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark while on this mission. In late 1889 Penrose was pardoned by Cleveland for polygamy, and shortly after went to prison for contempt of court for refusing to testify against other polygamists.

==Salt Lake==
In 1892, Penrose left the Deseret News and joined the staff of the &quot;Salt Lake Herald&quot;. He also became an assistant historian of the LDS Church. That same year he was a delegate to the Democratic Party national convention in Chicago. In 1894, Penrose was one of the initial directors of the Genealogical Society of Utah. He became vice president of the society in 1909 and president in 1921, serving in that position until his death. In 1898 Penrose returned to the Deseret News as editor.

==Apostle==
Penrose was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and ordained an apostle on July 7, 1904. He was called to fill a vacancy in the quorum caused by the death of Abraham O. Woodruff. From 1906 until 1910 Penrose served as president of the LDS Church&#x27;s European Mission. On December 7, 1911, Penrose became Second Counselor to Joseph F. Smith in the church&#x27;s First Presidency; he replaced John Henry Smith, who died. James E. Talmage filled the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve caused by Penrose&#x27;s being called into the First Presidency. After Joseph F. Smith&#x27;s death in 1918, Penrose was retained as Second Counselor by new church president Heber J. Grant. On March 10, 1921, Penrose became First Counselor in the First Presidency, following the death of Anthon H. Lund, who had died eight days earlier.

==Family==
Penrose first married during his first mission to Lucetta Stratford in 1855. They had originally requested permission to marry in 1854 but it was not granted at that time by mission leaders. LDS missionaries marrying was allowed in the 19th-century and in the cases of single missionaries about to leave the mission for a long trek to Utah at times even encouraged. Charles and Lucetta had 15 children, although only 7 survived infancy.

In 1863, Penrose married Louise Elizabeth Lusty. They eventually had 11 children, eight of whom lived to adulthood.

Penrose was married to Romania B. Pratt Penrose in 1886.

==Death==
Penrose served in the First Presidency until his death in Salt Lake City from chronic prostatitis. In the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; on the occasion of his death George H. Brimhall published a poem praising Penrose for his works of hymns. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.
==Hymns==
Some of Penrose&#x27;s poems were put to music and became LDS Church hymns. Penrose&#x27;s &quot;Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion&quot;—originally a militant hymn containing references to trials of Latter-day Saints in the central United States and the threatening United States government (ironically set to the melody for &quot;Columbia, Gem of the Ocean&quot;)—became an anthem for Latter-day Saints during the difficulties preceding and during the Utah War of 1857–58.

Some of Penrose&#x27;s lyrics appear in the LDS Church&#x27;s 1985 hymnal, including:
*&quot;God of Our Fathers, We Come Unto Thee&quot;
*&quot;O Ye Mountains High&quot; (with modified lyrics, 1948)
*&quot;School Thy Feelings&quot;
*&quot;Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion&quot; (with modified lyrics, 1985)

<text>Ian Ewen-Street (born 1949) is a New Zealand politician. He was a member of the Green Party and a Member of the New Zealand Parliament for the Greens from 1999 to 2005. He has been prominent in advocacy for organic farming, organic gardening and biosecurity in New Zealand.

==Political career==


In the , when the Green Party was part of the Alliance, Ewen-Street was the Alliance candidate for the Kaikoura electorate, where he came fourth in the candidate vote. His list ranking of 52 was far too low to enter Parliament as a list MP.

He first entered Parliament as a list MP in the 1999 election, having been ranked third on the newly independent Green Party&#x27;s party list. He was re-elected in the 2002 election. In June 2004, however, he announced that he would be retiring from politics at the next election, saying that the birth of his daughter meant that he wanted to spend more time at home.

In August 2006, Ewen-Street joined the National Party, saying his passion for the environment hasn&#x27;t changed, but he believes more progress can be made through a major party such as National.

==Personal life==
Ewen-Street was in a relationship with Sue Grey, a Nelson lawyer. Ewen-Street resigned the probe into scampi when he fell in love with Grey while she was appearing before his select committee on the scampi inquiry. Ewen-Street laid a police complaint when Grey was fired from the Department of Conservation, alleging judicial misconduct.

In 2003 Ewen-Street divorced Margaret O&#x27;Brien, his wife of 16 years, and had a daughter with Grey named Ysabella; Grey had two children from a previous relationship.

<text>George Franklin Richards (February 23, 1861 – August 8, 1950) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from April 9, 1906, until his death. He also served as Acting Presiding Patriarch of the LDS Church from 1937 to 1942 and President of the Quorum of the Twelve from May 25, 1945, until his death.

==Family==

Richards was born in Farmington, Utah Territory, the son of Franklin D. Richards and Nanny Longstroth. Richards&#x27; father was an apostle of the LDS Church and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Franklin D. Richards also served as President of the Quorum of the Twelve from 1898 to 1899.

After George Richards&#x27;s death, one of his sons, LeGrand, became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church, thus making the Richards family only the third Latter-day Saint family in history with three consecutive generations with members in the Quorum (the others being the succession of George A. Smith, John Henry Smith, and George Albert Smith and of Amasa M. Lyman, Francis M. Lyman, and Richard R. Lyman).

Richards was baptized by Oliver L. Robinson, who would later become his father-in-law. In 1882, Richards married Alice A. Robinson. George and Alice had 15 children. One of the halls in Heritage Halls at Brigham Young University is named for Alice.

==Education==
Richards received a degree in English from the University of Deseret, later the University of Utah. He also studied mathematics there.

==Employment and politics==
Richards worked for the Utah Central Railway as a clerk from 1881 to 1882. From 1885 to 1888, Richards lived on a farm in Fielding, Box Elder County, Utah. In 1888, he moved to Tooele, Utah, where he served on the school board and on the irrigation board as well as directing the Tooele City Water Company. Richards engaged in farming and the lumber business in Tooele. Initially in Tooele, Richards and his family lived and worked on the ranch of his uncle. In 1896, he bought his own house and farmland in Tooele. From 1899 to 1900, Richards served as a member of the Utah House of Representatives from Tooele County.

==LDS Church service==

===Early church callings===
Richards was ordained an elder in the LDS Church at age fifteen. He received the endowment shortly after this. Among various early callings he held were those of home missionary (similar to what would later be called a stake missionary, and eventually a ward missionary) and president of the ward Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA). In 1890, Richards became second counselor in the presidency of the Tooele Utah Stake.

In 1893, Richards was ordained a patriarch by Francis M. Lyman. At age 32, Richards was one of the youngest men to have ever held this office in the church.

===Calling as an apostle===

In 1905, two members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles resigned after an argument over LDS Church doctrine and policy. John W. Taylor disagreed with the 1890 Manifesto forbidding plural marriage; Matthias F. Cowley felt that it should apply only to the territory of the United States. In February of the next year, apostle Marriner W. Merrill died; this left three vacancies in the Quorum.

On April 8, 1906, at the LDS Church&#x27;s general conference, Richards was called to be an apostle by church president Joseph F. Smith. He was ordained and set apart the following day, ahead of Orson F. Whitney and David O. McKay.

===Early assignments in the Twelve===
Richards was appointed to the General Boards of the YMMIA and the Religion Classes shortly after his call to the Twelve. He also served as an advisor to the Primary General Board beginning in 1909, initially as one of the first two priesthood advisors to the board (along with Hyrum M. Smith).

During his early days in the Twelve, Richards went on several tours of missions in the United States as well as visiting many stake conferences.

===Mission president===
In 1916, Richards was made the president of the church&#x27;s European Mission. In this position he was directly over missionary work in Great Britain as well as having a supervisory role over the mission presidents on the European continent. Among the mission presidents in mainland Europe was Richards&#x27;s son LeGrand, who was president of the Netherlands Mission. George F. Richards, Jr. and his wife Edith accompanied George F. Richards while he served as mission president.

Richards succeeded Hyrum M. Smith as president of the European Mission.

===Temple president===
From 1921 to 1938, Richards was the president of the Salt Lake Temple. In this capacity, he assisted in the changing of the temple ordinances to conform with the church&#x27;s &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; policy. During his time as temple president the modern methods and uses of the temple were largely instituted. Baptisms for health and ordinations of the sick were discontinued in the temple, and endowment sessions starting at night were begun.

===Acting Presiding Patriarch===
In 1937, Richards was asked by church president Heber J. Grant to assume the duties that would normally be carried out by the church&#x27;s Presiding Patriarch. Richards accepted, and served in this capacity until 1942, when Grant called Joseph Fielding Smith to be the church&#x27;s Presiding Patriarch. Richards was called, sustained, and set apart as the Acting Presiding Patriarch to the LDS Church because he was not a direct descendant of the first Latter Day Saint patriarch, Joseph Smith, Sr. During his tenure as Acting Presiding Patriarch, Richards remained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and retained his seniority within that body.

===President of the Twelve===
With the death of LDS Church president Heber J. Grant, Richards became the second-most senior apostle in the church and thus the President of the Quorum of the Twelve on May 21, 1945, a position which he held until his death. He is the only person in the church&#x27;s history to have been both the Presiding Patriarch and the President of the Quorum of the Twelve.

==Death==

Richards died in Salt Lake City of coronary thrombosis. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. After Richards&#x27;s death, Delbert L. Stapley was called in the October general conference of that year to fill the vacancy, and David O. McKay became President of the Quorum.

<doc id="1072657" wikidata="Q7104160" url="?curid=1072657" title="Orson F. Whitney">
<text>Orson Ferguson Whitney (1 July 1855 – 16 May 1931), born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1906 until his death.

==Early life==
Whitney was the son of Horace K. Whitney and Helen Mar Kimball. Whitney&#x27;s father, Horace, had set type for the original publication of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and worked as a printer with the newspaper for 21 years.

==Background==
Whitney was a politician, journalist, poet, historian and academic. In 1878, as a young man, Whitney began a career in writing with the business office of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, later becoming a reporter and the city editor. Whitney served as a missionary for the LDS Church for a time in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

During a mission in Europe for the LDS Church from 1881 to 1883, he acted as editor of the church publication &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. In 1896 and 1897, Whitney taught English and theology at Brigham Young College in Logan, Utah.

In 1899, Whitney accepted the position of Assistant Church Historian and served in that position until he was called as an apostle.

Whitney was also involved in the politics of Salt Lake City and Utah. He served on the Salt Lake City Council in 1880, acted as City Treasurer from 1884 to 1890, and served as a State Senator in 1898, and again in 1901.

==Personal life==
Like many early Mormons, Whitney practiced polygamy. Whitney had two wives (simultaneously), having married the second in 1888. After the 1890 Manifesto on polygamy, Whitney became a strong supporter of the policy ending polygamy.

==Writing==
Whitney produced the lyrics to several LDS Church hymns, including &quot;The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close&quot; (music composed by Edward P. Kimball) and &quot;Savior Redeemer of My Soul&quot; (music by Harry A. Dean); these hymns appear as numbers 37 and 112, respectively, in the current edition of the LDS Church hymnal.

Whitney&#x27;s historical works, although detailed, well researched and presented, are written from a Latter-day Saint perspective; one 21st-century historian has commented that they are &quot;locked in the ironclad orthodoxy&quot; of Mormonism.

In June 1888 (and published the following month in &quot;The Contributor&quot;), Whitney delivered a speech entitled &quot;Home Literature&quot;; the speech is widely credited with proving both permission and impetus for Mormon literature and is the source of the sentence, &quot;We will yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own.&quot;

Whitney prepared a biography of Lorenzo Snow, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, for publication in 1890. However it was not published at that time. It was entitled, &quot;Latter Leaves in the Life of Lorenzo Snow&quot;. In 2012, Dennis B. Horne published an edited and expanded version of this work under the same title with Cedar Fort, Inc., of Springville, Utah. This work covered the Snow&#x27;s life from 1885 to 1889 and was written as a continuation of Snow&#x27;s sister, Eliza R. Snow&#x27;s, work &quot;Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow&quot;. In publishing this work, Horne included Whitney&#x27;s work as the first nine chapters of his book and then covered the following 11 years of Snow&#x27;s life. Horne&#x27;s published record only included about a third of Whitney&#x27;s manuscript of his history of Lorenzo Snow.

Publications include:
*&quot;The Life of Heber C. Kimball&quot; (1888)
*&quot;Poetical Writings&quot; (1889–90)
*&quot;History of Utah&quot; (4 Volumes)
*&quot;&quot; (1904)
*&quot;Love and the Light: An Idyll of the Westland&quot; (1918)

==LDS Church service==
In 1905, two members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles resigned over a dispute regarding the 1890 Manifesto, which prohibited any further plural marriages within the church. John W. Taylor disagreed with the Manifesto entirely; Matthias F. Cowley felt that it should apply only to the United States. In February of the next year, Marriner W. Merrill died, which left three vacancies in the quorum.

At a general conference of the church on April 8, 1906, Whitney was called as an apostle, along with George F. Richards and David O. McKay.

==Death and legacy==
Whitney died in Salt Lake City after being hospitalized for influenza. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Whitney is the namesake of the community of Whitney, Idaho.

<text>Morris the Cat is the advertising mascot for 9Lives brand cat food, appearing on its packaging and in many of its television commercials since the 1970s.

==Description==
A large orange tabby tomcat, the character of Morris the Cat is &quot;the world&#x27;s most finicky cat&quot;, eating only 9Lives cat food and making this preference clear with humorously sardonic voice-over comments when offered other brands. Every can of 9Lives features Morris&#x27; &quot;signature&quot;. Three different cats have played Morris the Cat.

The original Morris was adopted in 1968 from the Hinsdale Humane Society, a Chicago-area animal shelter, by professional animal handler Bob Martwick. An invention of the Leo Burnett advertising company where Martwick worked, Morris was featured in 58 television commercials which aired from 1969 to 1978. John Erwin provided the voice-over for the cat. Morris won two PATSY Awards (an award for animal performers in film and television) in 1972 and 1973. The original Morris died on July 7, 1978, in his native Chicago of old age.

All cats to play Morris have been rescue animals, either from an animal shelter or a cat rescue. After receiving multiple contacts from individuals who claimed that they were the original owner of Morris, Bob Martwick chose not to reveal which shelter he obtained the second Morris from. After a yearlong search, Martwick selected the second Morris, who began appearing in commercials in 1979. The first two cats to play Morris lived with Martwick as pets. Morris&#x27;s popularity continued into the 1980s, with the Leo Burnett Company orchestrating a mock presidential campaign for Morris in 1988.

The current Morris lives in Los Angeles with his handler, Rose Ordile. The Leo Burnett Company parted ways with 9Lives&#x27; corporate parent Heinz in 1994.

==Other appearances==
Morris has appeared in other media over the years. He debuted in the Robert Altman film &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; with Elliott Gould, and appeared in the movie &quot;Shamus&quot; with Burt Reynolds and Dyan Cannon in 1973.
Morris also appears as a &quot;spokescat&quot; promoting responsible pet ownership, pet health and pet adoptions through animal shelters. To this end, he has &quot;authored&quot; three books: &quot;The Morris Approach,&quot; &quot;The Morris Method&quot; and &quot;The Morris Prescription&quot;. He was quoted at the 1993 &quot;end of year&quot; edition of &quot;People&quot; magazine which noted deaths of 1993 to which he quoted a simple &quot;Meow&quot; in honor of the death of his friend, fellow advertising mascot, the dog Spuds MacKenzie.

In 2006, Morris was depicted as adopting a kitten, Li&#x27;l Mo, from a Los Angeles animal shelter, representing the first adoptee in a campaign known as Morris&#x27; Million Cat Rescue.

==British advertising==
When he first appeared in British television advertisements in the late 1970s, he was coincidentally voiced by Johnny Morris (then famous in the UK for his anthropomorphic character portrayals in the series &quot;Animal Magic&quot;), which led many British viewers, unaware of the character&#x27;s origins, to wrongly suppose that the cat had been named after Morris himself. British ads for 9Lives later featured the voice of Richard Briers.

<doc id="1072662" wikidata="Q4888830" url="?curid=1072662" title="Benjamin Hooks">
<text>Benjamin Lawson Hooks (January 31, 1925 – April 15, 2010) was an American civil rights leader and government official. A Baptist minister and practicing attorney, he served as executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1977 to 1992.

Throughout his career, Hooks was a vocal campaigner for civil rights in the United States, and served from July 5, 1972 – July 25, 1977 as the first African American member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

==Early life==
Benjamin Hooks was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Growing up on South Lauderdale and Vance, he was the fifth son of Robert B and Bessie White Hooks. He had six siblings. His father was a photographer and owned a photography studio with his brother Henry, known at the time as Hooks Brothers, and the family was fairly comfortable by the standards of black people for the day. He recalled that he had to wear hand-me-down clothes and that his mother had to be careful to make the dollars stretch to feed and care for the family.

Young Benjamin&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Julia Britton Hooks (1852–1942), graduated from Berea College in Kentucky in 1874 and was only the second American black woman to graduate from college. She was a musical prodigy. She began playing piano publicly at age five and at age 18, joined Berea&#x27;s faculty, teaching instrumental music 1870–72. Her sister, Dr. Mary E. Britton, also attended Berea, and became a physician in Lexington, Kentucky.

With such a family legacy, young Benjamin was inspired to work hard on his academic career, with hopes of being able to make it to college. In his youth, he felt a calling to the Christian ministry. His father, however, did not approve and discouraged Benjamin from such a calling.

Benjamin was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

In 1952 he married Frances Darby, a 24-year-old science teacher.

==Education==

Hooks enrolled in LeMoyne-Owen College, in Memphis, Tennessee. There he undertook a pre-law course of study 1941–43. In his college years he became more acutely aware that he was one of a large number of Americans who were required to use segregated lunch counters, water fountains, and restrooms. &quot;I wish I could tell you every time I was on the highway and couldn’t use a restroom,&quot; he would later recall. &quot;My bladder is messed up because of that. Stomach is messed up from eating cold sandwiches.&quot;

After graduating in 1944 from Howard University, he joined the Army and had the job of guarding Italian prisoners of war. He found it humiliating that the prisoners were allowed to eat in restaurants from which he was barred. He was discharged from the Army after the end of the war with the rank of staff sergeant.

After the war he enrolled at the DePaul University College of Law in Chicago to study law. No law school in his native Tennessee would admit him. He graduated from DePaul in 1948 with his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.

==Legal career==
Upon graduation Hooks immediately returned to his native Memphis. By this time he was thoroughly committed to breaking down the practices of racial segregation that existed in the United States. Fighting prejudice at every turn, he passed the Tennessee bar exam and set up his own law practice. &quot;At that time you were insulted by law clerks, excluded from white bar associations and when I was in court, I was lucky to be called Ben,&quot; he recalled in an interview with &quot;Jet&quot; magazine. &quot;Usually it was just ‘boy.’ [But] the judges were always fair. The discrimination of those days has changed and, today, the South is ahead of the North in many respects in civil rights progress.&quot; In 1949 Hooks was one of only a few black lawyers in Memphis.

Hooks was a friend and associate of Dr. T.R.M. Howard, the head of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL), a leading civil rights organization in Mississippi. Hooks attended the RCNL&#x27;s annual conferences in the all-black town of Mound Bayou, Mississippi which often drew crowds of ten thousand or more. In 1954, only days before the U.S. Supreme Court handed down Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, he appeared on an RCNL-sponsored roundtable, along with Thurgood Marshall, and other black Southern attorneys to formulate possible litigation strategies.

==Other endeavors==
Hooks always felt drawn to the Christian church, and in 1956 he was ordained as a Baptist minister and began to preach regularly at the Greater Middle Baptist Church in Memphis, while continuing his busy law practice. He joined Martin Luther King Jr., and other leaders, at the initial January 1957 Southern Negro Leaders Conference on Transportation and Nonviolent Integration, which organized itself, by August, as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), with whom he became an active participant in the NAACP-sponsored restaurant sit-ins and other boycotts of consumer items and services.

In addition to his other roles, he decided to enter Tennessee state politics and ran unsuccessfully for the state legislature in 1954 and for juvenile court judge in 1959 and 1963.Though he did not win, he attracted the support of many black voters and liberal whites as well. In 1965 Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement appointed him to fill a vacancy in the Shelby County criminal court. With this he became the first black criminal court judge in Tennessee history. His temporary appointment to the bench expired in 1966 but he campaigned for, and won election to a full term in the same judicial office.

By the late 1960s Hooks was a judge, a businessman, a lawyer, and a minister, but he continued to do more. Twice a month he flew to Detroit to preach at the Greater New Mount Moriah Baptist Church. He also continued to work with the NAACP in civil rights protests and marches. Fortunately for Hooks, his wife Frances matched him in energy and stamina. She became her husband&#x27;s assistant, secretary, advisor, and traveling companion, even though it meant sacrificing her own career. &quot;He said he needed me to help him&quot;, she told &quot;Ebony&quot;. &quot;Few husbands tell their wives that they need them after 30 years of marriage, so I gave it up and here I am, right by his side.&quot;

Hooks had been a producer and host of several local television shows in Memphis in addition to his other duties and was a strong supporter of Republican political candidates. In 1972, President Richard Nixon appointed Hooks to be one of the five commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Senate confirmed the nomination, and Benjamin and Frances Hooks moved to Washington, D.C. in 1973. As a member of the FCC, Hooks addressed the lack of minority ownership of television and radio stations, the minority employment statistics for the broadcasting industry, and the image of blacks in the mass media. Hooks completed his five-year term on the board of commissioners in 1978, but he continued to work for black involvement in the entertainment industry.

== Fraternal Organizations ==
Hooks was involved with several Black fraternal organization often serving in leadership roles. He served as the Supreme Chancellor of the Knights of Pythias, Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee, Prince Hall, honorary Past Imperial Potentate of the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, a 33rd degree Scottish Rite mason, and was a member and received the Elks&#x27; Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award in 1989 from the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World.

==The NAACP==

On November 6, 1976, the 64-member board of directors of the NAACP elected Hooks executive director of the organization. In the late 1970s the membership had declined from a high of about 500,000 to only about 200,000. Hooks was determined to add to the enrollment and to raise money for the organization&#x27;s severely depleted treasury, without changing the NAACP&#x27;s goals or mandates. &quot;Black Americans are not defeated,&quot; he told &quot;Ebony&quot; soon after his formal induction in 1977. &quot;The civil rights movement is not dead. If anyone thinks that we are going to stop agitating, they had better think again. If anyone thinks that we are going to stop litigating, they had better close the courts. If anyone thinks that we are not going to demonstrate and protest, they had better roll up the sidewalks.&quot;

In his early years at the NAACP, Hooks had some bitter arguments with Margaret Bush Wilson, chairwoman of the NAACP&#x27;s board of directors. At one point in 1983, Wilson summarily suspended Hooks after a quarrel over the organization&#x27;s policy. Wilson accused Hooks of mismanagement but the charges were never proven. A majority of the board backed Hooks and he never officially left his post 
In 1980, Hooks explained why the NAACP was against using violence to obtain civil rights:
:&quot;There are a lot of ways an oppressed people can rise. One way to rise is to study, to be smarter than your oppressor. The concept of rising against oppression through physical contact is stupid and self-defeating. It exalts brawn over brain. And the most enduring contributions made to civilization have not been made by brawn, they have been made by brain.&quot;

==Views on equality==

Early in 1990 Hooks and his family were among the targets in a wave of bombings against civil rights leaders. Hooks visited President George H. W. Bush in the White House to discuss the escalating tensions between races. He emerged from that meeting with the government&#x27;s full support against racially motivated bomb attacks, but he was very critical of the administration&#x27;s apparent lack of action concerning inner city poverty and lack of support for public education.

On the other hand, Hooks would not lay all the blame for America&#x27;s ills at the feet of its elected officials. He had been a staunch advocate of self-help among the black community, urging wealthy and middle-class blacks to give time and resources to those less fortunate. &quot;It’s time today... to bring it out of the closet: No longer can we proffer polite, explicable, reasons why Black America cannot do more for itself,&quot; he told the 1990 NAACP convention delegates. &quot;I’m calling for a moratorium on excuses. I challenge black America today—all of us—to set aside our alibis.&quot;

By 1991 some younger members of the NAACP thought that Hooks had lost touch with black America and ought to resign. One newspaper wrote: &quot;Critics say the organization is a dinosaur whose national leadership is still living in the glory days of the civil rights movement.&quot; Dr. Frederick Zak, a young local NAACP president, was quoted as saying, &quot;There is a tendency by some of the older people to romanticize the struggle—especially the marching and the picketing and the boycotting and the going to jail.&quot;

Hooks felt that the perilous times of the civil rights movement should never be taken for granted, especially by those who were born in the aftermath of the movement&#x27;s gains. &quot;A young black man can’t understand what it means to have something he’s never been denied,’ Hooks told &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. &quot;I can’t make them understand the mental relief I feel at the rights we have. It almost infuriates me that people don’t understand what integration has done for this country.&quot;

==Retirement==

Hooks and his wife handled the NAACP&#x27;s business and helped to plan for its future for more than 15 years. He told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that a &quot;sense of duty and responsibility&quot; to the NAACP compelled him to stay in office through the 1990s, but eventually the demands of the executive director position proved too great for a man of his age. In February 1992, at the age of 67, he announced his resignation from the post, calling it &quot;a killing job,&quot; according to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. Hooks stated that he would serve out the 1992 year and predicted that a change in leadership would not jeopardize the NAACP&#x27;s stability: &quot;We’ve been through some little stormy periods before. I think we’ll overcome it.&quot;

Hooks served as a distinguished adjunct professor for the Political Science department of the University of Memphis. Hooks also resumed preaching at the Greater Middle Baptist Church in Memphis where he had begun preaching in 1956. On March 24, 2001, Benjamin Hooks and Frances Hooks renewed their wedding vows for the third time, after nearly 50 years of marriage. The ceremony was held in the Greater Middle Baptist Church in Memphis . Hooks died on April 15, 2010, at 85 years old. His funeral was held at Temple of Deliverance Church of God in Christ on April 21, 2010.

<text>James Edward Talmage (21 September 1862 – 27 July 1933) was an English chemist, geologist, and religious leader who served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1911 until his death.

A professor at Brigham Young Academy (BYA) and University of Utah (U of U), Talmage also served as president of the U of U and Latter-day Saints&#x27; University. In addition to his academic career, Talmage authored several books on religion, the most prominent of which are &quot;Jesus the Christ&quot; and &quot;Articles of Faith&quot; which remain classics in Mormon literature more than a century after publication. An academic and religious scholar, Talmage did not believe that science conflicted with his religious views. Regarding the conflicting Mormon views on evolution, Talmage attempted to mediate between church leaders B.H. Roberts and Joseph Fielding Smith who disagreed about evolution and the origin of man. In addition to his academic and religious involvement, Talmage was involved in local political leadership in Provo as a city council member, alderman, and justice of the peace.

==Early life and education==
James E. Talmage, the first son of Susannah Preater and James Joyce Talmage, was born on 21 September 1862 and raised in Hungerford, Berkshire, England. He was born in the Bell Inn, a hotel in Hungerford, where his father was the manager. Talmage&#x27;s parents converted to the LDS Church, probably in the 1850s before his birth. Neighbors and local clergy did not like the Talmage family&#x27;s membership in the LDS Church or their innkeeping business, which included serving alcoholic beverages during the temperance movement. Shortly after Talmage&#x27;s birth, his family moved into a cottage in Edington, where most of his ten younger siblings were born. Talmage moved to Rambury to stay with his grandfather at the age of two. There he attended infant schools and received some schooling from his grandfather. He returned to Hungerford to live with his parents at age five. As Talmage was spending his time helping take care of his siblings and helping at the inn, he attended school sporadically for the next three years.

At the age of twelve, he graduated from elementary school, passing the Oxford Diocesan Association exam for a second-class certificate. Talmage received a distinguished primary education and was named an Oxford Diocesan Prize Scholar after six years of schooling. He was baptized a member of LDS Church at age 10 on 15 June 1873, but due to local hostilities toward Latter-day Saints, he was baptized in secret at night. The same year he accidentally pierced his younger brother&#x27;s (Albert) eye with a digging fork, blinding him. He moved with his family to Provo, Utah Territory, in 1876. In Provo, he studied the Normal Course at BYA, with Karl G. Maeser as one of his teachers; he graduated in 1879 at the age of seventeen. He became an instructor at BYA while continuing to study. In 1881, Talmage became the first graduate from the Scientific Department at BYA and the first student from BYA to receive a college degree.

== Further education and career ==
Talmage&#x27;s early predilection was for the sciences, and in 1882 and 1883 he took selected courses in chemistry and geology at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. After graduating, he started advanced work at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1883. In the spring of 1884, while at Johns Hopkins, Talmage journaled about many laboratory experiments, including one on the ingestion of hashish. After researching at Johns Hopkins, he returned to BYA and became a professor of geology and chemistry. Shortly after returning to BYA, Talmage became the counselor (chief assistant) to its principal, Maeser, and worked as acting principal during Maeser&#x27;s absence. He also became a member of BYA&#x27;s board of trustees, an alternate member of the Utah Stake high council and was a common speaker at youth meetings across Utah county.

That same year, Talmage was elected as a People&#x27;s Party candidate to the Provo City Council. His main goal in joining the city council was to implement anti-saloon legislation, but he did not succeed. Shortly before taking office as a member of the city council, Talmage had a lab accident that nearly cost him his sight. A few months later, he was elected an alderman which added judicial as well as legislative duties to his assignments.

=== LDS College ===
In the summer of 1888, Talmage was recruited by the church&#x27;s First Presidency to lead the new Salt Lake Stake Academy in Salt Lake City, a high school for the stake, where he worked closely with Angus M. Cannon. In 1889, the Salt Lake Stake Academy was renamed LDS College and Talmage continued as its head until 1892. While in this position he was recruited widely to give lectures to civic groups, various assemblies connected with the LDS Church and other groups. One of Talmage&#x27;s first tasks as principal of LDS College was to write a science textbook for the youth in the school. He produced &quot;First Book of Nature&quot; which went to press in November 1888. In 1891, Talmage published a work entitled &quot;Domestic Science&quot; at the urging of Wilford Woodruff and the other members of the First Presidency. This was a more general work on science aimed at an older audience. In April 1889, Talmage was appointed a member of the examining board for all schools of LDS Church, along with Maeser and Joseph M. Tanner. This board approved teachers to teach with any school run by the church.

In January 1891, Talmage was replaced at LDS College by his assistant, Willard Done. Talmage was appointed, along with Willard Young, to form a new university to be run by the LDS Church in Salt Lake City, called Young University. He continued lecturing on scientific subjects at LDS College through the end of that academic year.

=== U of U president ===
In the summer of 1894, an agreement was made between the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency and representatives of the U of U. The agreement allowed for Talmage to become the institution&#x27;s president, in return for which the church donated the resources it had gathered for Young University to the U of U and funded the creation of the chair of geology, to which Talmage was appointed.

Shortly after Talmage became the university&#x27;s president, a department of philosophy was created. Also during his tenure, the department of history and civics was created, and the school of mines was organized. In 1896, the U of U organized a department of economics and sociology, with George Coray as head. Coray was also made head of the library. In 1897, Talmage was able to persuade the state legislature to appropriate money for the expansion of the university library.

Talmage also organized and directed a program of evening lectures run by the university, where he served on the lecture steering committee. The lectures were mainly aimed at the general public. Also under Talmage&#x27;s direction the university began publication of the U of U Quarterly.

=== Academic citizenship ===
In 1891, Talmage became curator of the Deseret Museum. In 1909, while Talmage was serving as the director of the Deseret Museum, he went to Detroit, Michigan, in November of that year to participate in diggings connected with the Scotford-Soper-Savage relics craze. Talmage would go on to denounce these findings as a forgery in the September 1911 edition of the &quot;Deseret Museum Bulletin&quot; in an article entitled, &quot;The Michigan Relics: A Story of Forgery and Deception&quot;. In 1911, after becoming a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, his son, Sterling Talmage, replaced him as curator of Deseret Museum.

Talmage spent much of the summer of 1890 in Britain. His main goal was attending the meeting of the Royal Microscopical Society where he gave a lecture on the Great Salt Lake and its brine shrimp. He also presented some horned toads that were then donated to a branch of the British Museum. During this trip, he regularly participated with missionaries of the LDS Church in street and other meetings. He also spent some time in and around Hungerford gathering records of his ancestors to do their temple work. He then traveled continental Europe, including Italy, with Reed Smoot and two other missionaries about to return home.

For many years, Talmage was a Fellow of the following learned societies: the Royal Microscopical Society (London), the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (Edinburgh), the Geological Society (London), the Geological Society of America, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also an Associate of the Philosophical Society of Great Britain, or Victoria Institute. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Lehigh University in 1891 and a PhD from Illinois Wesleyan University for nonresident work in 1896. In 1912, Talmage received an honorary PhD from Lehigh University. He was the president of Latter-day Saints&#x27; University from 1889 to 1894 and then was president of the University of Deseret from 1894 to 1897. Talmage became president of the U of U in 1893 and continued there until 1897. From 1897 until 1907 he held the chair of geology at the U of U.

=== Mining consultant ===
From the late 1890s to 1911, Talmage worked as an independent mining consultant and served as a scientific consultant in legal disputes surrounding Utah&#x27;s mining industry. Talmage was an expert in mining and applied chemistry and had cultivated a positive reputation in his various religious and civic leadership positions. Due to his financial success in consulting, he officially ended his academic career in 1907. 

Perhaps the most controversial mine Talmage analyzed during his career was John A. Koyle&#x27;s Relief Mine, also known as the Dream Mine. Koyle&#x27;s mine began in Spanish Fork, Utah in the 1890s and was formally incorporated as a business in 1909. Koyle had allegedly prophesied that the mine would offer the LDS Church resources during times of crisis. Many local residents invested in the mine&#x27;s stock, believing Koyle&#x27;s prophecies that the mine contained valuable materials. Talmage assessed the mine&#x27;s production in 1913 and determined it was worthless.

==LDS Church writings and service ==

=== Religious literary works ===
Talmage was the author of several religious books, including &quot;The Articles of Faith&quot;, &quot;The Great Apostasy&quot;, &quot;The House of the Lord&quot;, and &quot;Jesus the Christ&quot;. These volumes remain in print and are still widely read in the LDS Church. In 1905, the church&#x27;s First Presidency requested Talmage write the book that would come to be known as &quot;Jesus the Christ&quot;. They requested he compile his lectures about the life of Jesus Christ into a book that would be widely available to church members and other readers. At that time, Talmage had many responsibilities with his church callings, his family, and his profession that kept him from starting the book but nearly ten years later, following another request from the First Presidency, he started writing &quot;Jesus the Christ&quot;. The significance that was placed on the writing of this book about the life of Christ is seen in the First Presidency&#x27;s setting aside space in the Salt Lake Temple for Talmage to work on the book uninterrupted and without distractions. &quot;Jesus the Christ&quot; was published in September 1915, just under one year after Talmage started writing it.

In 1911, the First Presidency learned that a man named Max Florence, a former theater owner in Salt Lake City, had gained unauthorized access to the Salt Lake Temple. He had taken numerous photographs of the interior and was holding those photographs for ransom, but the church president at that time, Joseph F. Smith, would not negotiate with Florence on the subject. Florence said that he would sell the pictures to anyone who named a high enough price. A few days after this news was publicized, Talmage suggested to the First Presidency that they commission their own photographs of the Salt Lake Temple and publicize them as a book of photos. Smith authorized Talmage to get the pictures and also write on the subject of the temple to accompany the publication of the photographs. &quot;The House of the Lord&quot; was completed and published shortly thereafter in 1912.

=== Church service ===
Before he became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Talmage was an alternate high councilor in the Utah Stake of Zion. He became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on 7 December 1911, after Charles W. Penrose was appointed as second counselor in the First Presidency. Additionally, from 1924 to 1928, Talmage served as president of the church&#x27;s European Mission.

== Views on science and religion ==
Talmage was an attentive student and teacher of science, but he did not believe there was conflict between science and religion and did not worry about differences or discrepancies between the two fields of thought. He believed that with time and continued learning, these discrepancies would eventually be resolved. He had confidence in the scientific method and was able to accept scientific discoveries and findings supported by it while still holding fast to his religious beliefs. His views on science and religion are demonstrated by this statement: &quot;Within the Gospel of Jesus Christ there is room for every truth thus far learned by man, or yet to be made known.&quot;

Talmage&#x27;s views on science and religion can also be seen through an event that took place in 1929. In that year, B.H. Roberts, a scientific scholar and LDS Church leader, presented a 700-page manuscript to the First Presidency which attempted to completely align theology and science. Other church leaders were concerned with what was written in this manuscript and disagreed with the claims about evolution represented. Joseph Fielding Smith, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, made a statement against what was written about evolution in the manuscript prepared by Roberts. Talmage tried to mediate between Smith and Roberts, suggesting to the First Presidency that they come out with a statement of neutrality on the issue, which they did. They soon came out with a statement stating that neither side of the argument was accepted as church doctrine.

== Political involvement ==
Almost immediately after his return to Provo, Utah after his schooling in the East, Talmage was asked to run for the office of Territorial Superintendent of Schools by the People&#x27;s Party. He could not accept due to his recent appointment as the first counselor in the presidency of BYA. Additionally, he was ineligible to run for office since he was not a United States citizen. Soon, he applied for citizenship and received his naturalization papers and although he was uninterested in political involvement aside from necessity, Talmage went on to serve on the Provo City Council as an alderman, and as a justice of the peace.

==Death==
Talmage died on 27 July 1933 in Salt Lake City at age 70. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. The vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve created by his death was filled by Charles Albert Callis.
== Personal life ==
In 1888, Talmage married Merry May Booth (1868–1944), on 14 June 1888. Booth was a native of Alpine, Utah, and the daughter of immigrants from Lancashire. She started studies at the normal school connected with BYA in 1885, when she was 16. It was there she met Talmage, who was one of her instructors. While at BYA, Booth was secretary of the Polysophical Society. After completing her course of normal study, May took a job as a teacher in Kaysville, Utah. A few months later, Talmage undertook a project to study the waters of the Great Salt Lake; Talmage&#x27;s main reason for this journey, though, was to pursue a relationship with Booth, and five months later they were married in Manti, Utah.

The Talmages had eight children. Among their children was John Russell Talmage (1911 - 2001), who wrote a biography of his father entitled &quot;The Talmage Story: Life of James E. Talmage - Educator, Scientist, Apostle&quot; (1972). Another of their children, Sterling B. Talmage (1889–1956) became a geologist.

==Legacy==
The Mathematics and Computer Sciences Building at Brigham Young University is named after James Talmage. The University of Utah College of Science is housed in the James E. Talmage Building.

<doc id="1072672" wikidata="Q5020787" url="?curid=1072672" title="2004 California Proposition 1A">
<text>Proposition 1A was a California ballot proposition on the November 2, 2004 ballot. The proposition passed with 9,411,198 (83.7%) votes in favor and 1,840,002 (16.3%) against.

The proposition is intended to protect revenues collected by local governments (cities, counties, and special districts) from being transferred to the California state government for statewide use. The provisions may be suspended if the governor declares a fiscal necessity and two-thirds of the California State Legislature approve the suspension. It did not take effect until 2006.

Proposition 1A was added to the ballot by the California Legislature as a state-sponsored compromise to take the place of the initiative-drawn Proposition 65 on the same ballot. It was passed by the California Assembly by a vote of 64-13. It was approved by the California State Senate by a vote of 34-5. Proponents of Prop 65 negotiated with state officials to draw up the provisions of Proposition 1A. The former proponents then dropped their support for 65 in favor of 1A.

==Official summary==
* Protects local funding for public safety, health, libraries, parks, and other locally delivered services.
* Prohibits the State from reducing local governments&#x27; property tax proceeds.
* Allows the provisions to be suspended only if the Governor declares a fiscal necessity and two-thirds of the Legislature approve the suspension. Suspended funds must be repaid within three years.
* Also requires local sales tax revenues to remain with local government and be spent for local purposes.
* Requires the State to fund legislative mandates on local governments or suspend their operation.

==Results==
==Impact==
The passing of California Proposition 1A resulted in significant changes to state authority over local finances:
*Higher local government revenues than otherwise would have been the case, possibly in the billions of dollars annually over time.
*Any such local revenue impacts would result in decreased resources to the state of similar amounts.

<doc id="1072673" wikidata="Q7328566" url="?curid=1072673" title="Richard R. Lyman">
<text>Richard Roswell Lyman (November 23, 1870 – December 31, 1963) was an American engineer and religious leader who was an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1918 to 1943.

Lyman is often noted as the most recent LDS Church apostle to have been excommunicated. In 1943, the church&#x27;s First Presidency became aware that Lyman had for a number of years been in an intimate relationship with a woman other than his legal wife. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles convened a disciplinary council and Lyman was immediately excommunicated. Lyman was rebaptized in 1954 at age 83, nine years prior to his death.

Lyman was the husband of Amy B. Lyman, the church&#x27;s Relief Society general president during the period of his excommunication.

==Early life and family==
Lyman was born in Fillmore, Utah Territory, and was closely related to many early leaders of the LDS Church. His father, Francis M. Lyman, was the son of Amasa M. Lyman, both of whom were LDS Church apostles. His mother was Clara Caroline Callister, whose grandfather was John Smith, an uncle of church founder Joseph Smith and a church Presiding Patriarch. Clara&#x27;s mother was Caroline Smith Callister, the only sister of apostle George A. Smith, who served with Brigham Young as a counselor in the First Presidency. Lyman was ordained an elder in the LDS Church on August 29, 1891, by Joseph F. Smith.

==Education and marriage==
Lyman graduated from high school at Brigham Young Academy (BYA) in Provo, Utah, in 1891 with a Normal Certificate, then taught at Brigham Young College in Logan, Utah, and later studied at the University of Michigan, graduating with a BS degree in 1895. He later pursued graduate studies in civil engineering, earning an MA from the University of Chicago in 1903 and a PhD from Cornell University in 1905.

In 1888, while attending BYA, Lyman began courting Amy Brown, but then left for the University of Michigan. After his graduation, from 1895 to 1896, Lyman taught at BYA. After eight years of courtship, Lyman married Brown on September 9, 1896; the marriage was performed by Joseph F. Smith in the Salt Lake Temple.

Amy Brown Lyman was a member of the church&#x27;s Relief Society general board, which had appointed her to lead the church&#x27;s newly formed Social Service Department to oversee aid to the needy. She had studied and engaged in social work during Lyman&#x27;s University of Chicago years. She later served as general secretary of the Relief Society, and then the eighth Relief Society general president from 1940 to 1945.

Richard Lyman was a prolific writer and engineer, contributing both non-technical and scientific articles to various publications. He authored key works on road construction and water flow measurement, earning the prestigious J. James R. Croes Gold Medal in 1915 for his contributions to engineering science. As vice-chairman of the Utah State Road Commission from 1909 to 1918, he played a crucial role in expanding its budget and infrastructure projects. Lyman also served as city engineer of Provo, worked on railroad surveys, and designed waterworks systems across Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. He held leadership roles in multiple irrigation, power, and insurance companies.

==Apostleship==
Lyman was ordained an apostle on April 7, 1918. As an apostle, he also served as Assistant Commissioner of the Church Educational System from 1919 to 1924, and as a member of the superintendency of the Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association until 1935. He was also president of the church’s European Mission from 1936 to 1938.

===Excommunication===
In 1922, Lyman was assigned to counsel Anna Jacobsen Hegsted, a woman previously excommunicated for polygamy, and prepare her for readmittance to the church. By 1925 the two had formed an attachment, but were unable to marry due to his existing marriage and the church&#x27;s ban on polygamy. Lyman and Jacobsen exchanged a promise to marry under plural marriage in the next life and continued to see each other.

Before returning from his service as mission president in Europe in 1938, Lyman maintained their relationship was not sexual. But upon his return, he reported, &quot;the long separation and the fiery nearness of her being my prospective plural wife ... led to a temptation I did not resist.&quot; By 1943, both individuals were in their seventies. 

In 1943, J. Reuben Clark, first counselor in the church&#x27;s First Presidency and its &quot;de facto&quot; leader due to church president Heber J. Grant&#x27;s poor health, became aware of suspicious behavior by Lyman. After the Salt Lake City Police Department, who were at the time enforcing anti-polygamy laws, joined the investigation by church leaders, Lyman and Jacobsen&#x27;s relationship was proven.

The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles convened a disciplinary council on November 12, 1943 to hear the case, and Lyman was immediately excommunicated. The church-owned Deseret News published the excommunication the next day, declaring that &quot;Richard R. Lyman has been excommunicated from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for violation of the Christian law of chastity.&quot;

Lyman&#x27;s wife, Amy B. Lyman, was the general president of the Relief Society at the time of his excommunication. She continued to serve for an additional 16 months before her release.

A minority opinion holds that Lyman and Jacobsen&#x27;s promise to marry functioned as a &quot;plural marriage by mutual covenant,&quot; but there is little indication that at any point they considered themselves being actually married. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball recorded regarding the disciplinary council that &quot;He tried to link his sin with polygamy but the evidence gave no corroboration to the story.&quot; After the excommunication, J. Reuben Clark worried that Lyman might join the Mormon fundamentalist movement, though this did not occur.

Age 72 at the time of his excommunication, Lyman later returned to the LDS Church through rebaptism on October 27, 1954, at age 83, but he was not reinstated as an apostle. He died in Salt Lake City, Utah on December 31, 1963. His full priesthood blessings were restored posthumously in 1970.

<doc id="1072679" wikidata="Q7316395" url="?curid=1072679" title="Results of the 2004 Australian federal election (House of Representatives)">
<text>The 2004 Australian federal election was held on Saturday 9 October 2004 and it was the Howard government&#x27;s opportunity to secure its fourth term of government. The Government consisting of the conservative coalition Liberal Party and National Party headed by John Howard and John Anderson respectively were opposed by Mark Latham and the Labor Party.

The Howard government would be returned for its fourth term, seeing major gains nationwide. It was able to increase its majority by 10 seats, from 14 to 24, and a secured an increased margin in seats it already held. The Coalition finished the election with 87 seats, to Labor&#x27;s 60. The remaining seats were held by independents.

The election post-mortem would reveal that there had been a large miscalculation by the Australian Labor Party, pollsters, and media alike. What was predicted to be a close election, possibly even a Labor win by many, resulted in a win for the Coalition and a decline in the primary vote for the Labor Party.

The following table shows results for the Australian House of Representatives at the 2004 federal election, Coalition 87, Australian Labor Party 60, with three independents.

== Lead up to the election ==
In 2001, John Howard&#x27;s Coalition government narrowly beat the Labor Party in what was deemed by many as an &quot;unwinnable&quot; election for the government. Issues of national security such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Tampa refugee crisis, allowed the government to turn its political fortunes around and secure a gain of two seats in the House of Representatives. The years following 2001 saw Australia controversially engage in the Iraq War as a member of the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ along with the United States and United Kingdom. This war was seen by many globally as a failure and it was predicted that the Howard government could be defeated due to the war&#x27;s unpopularity. Another western democracy, Spain, had seen its pro-Iraq war government defeated in an election earlier that year and it was speculated that the Australian government might suffer the same fate.
On the 29th of August 2004, the prime minister announced that a federal election would be held on October 9, 2004. This was an unusual time to announce an election, many thought the ongoing Athens Olympic Games gathering most of the public&#x27;s attention. It was also an unusually long election campaign at 6 weeks. Many pundits predicted a tight race with Michelle Grattan stating on the day of the announcement that the campaign would be &quot;an unpredictable and exciting election in which neither leader starts with a decisive break, either could take the prize, and absolutely anything could happen in between&quot;. However, the Government was campaigning from a strong position politically.

Despite the poignancy of the Iraq War as an issue, issues surrounding the economy such as interest rates, the size of the deficit, taxation and unemployment dominated the political agenda during the election campaign. The sale of Telstra was also an influential topic. The Howard government had delivered several budget surpluses and Australian&#x27;s were enjoying a period of strong economic growth and low unemployment. The government afforded many tax breaks and concessions to middle-income earners, which despite not being revolutionary policy, bought them favour with large sections of the electorate. Add to this that the Labor Party had found itself in the political wilderness since 2001, spending much of its time between 2001 and 2004 under Simon Crean who suffered consistently poor polling, and the Howard government looked as though it had a strong grip on power. Labor eventually switched leaders in early 2004 to allow itself a better chance at the election. Crean resigned to allow Mark Latham to assume the position of leader in 2003 in a contested ballot against Kim Beazley.

== Redistributions in the Lower House ==

; Victoria 
In 2002-03 there was a significant redistribution of two Victorian seats. The electorate of McMillan, a marginal Labor electorate was redistributed to become a nominally Liberal seat. The electorate of Gippsland, a seat seen as a fairly safe for the National Party was redistributed to become more marginal.

; South Australia
In 2003, the Australian Electoral Commission determined that South Australia would lose a seat and Queensland would gain a seat. It was decided that the electorate of Bonython would be absorbed into the electorate of Wakefield, drastically changing the demographics of this electorate in the process. It was unknown what the change would yield in terms of election results.

; Queensland 
Queensland&#x27;s rising population saw it become entitled to an additional seat. This new seat would come in the form of an Eastern Brisbane electorate, Bonner. Bonner was a nominally Liberal electorate that took territory from the electorate of Bowman, a Labor seat. This redistribution would see the seat become nominally Liberal.

=== New South Wales===

&lt;section begin=&quot;NSW infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;NSW infobox&quot; /&gt;

Four seats changed hands in NSW during this election, with the Liberal Party experiencing a primary vote of 36.2%, one of its strongest tally&#x27;s since the 1975 poll and at the expense of the Labor Party. The opposition lost ground in the outer suburbs of Sydney, areas which it once considered to be very strong for its vote. The Nationals&#x27; vote remained steady but the Greens&#x27; vote increased by 3.3%, the party&#x27;s second best result in the state.&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

===Victoria===
&lt;section begin=&quot;Vic infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;Vic infobox&quot; /&gt;

In Victoria, the poor result seen in other states for Labor wasn&#x27;t reflected. Labor was able to achieve above 40% of the primary vote in this state, its poorest since 1990. The Liberal Party performed strongly in Victoria recording their best results in the state since the election of 1954 with 43.2% of the primary vote. The National&#x27;s and Green vote held steady in the state, while the Australian Democrat vote fell sharply to 1.1%.&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

=== Queensland ===

&lt;section begin=&quot;Qld infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;Qld infobox&quot; /&gt;

The Labor Party returned poor polling in the state, especially considering it was enjoying strong results at a state level through to 2004. Indeed, Labor recorded some of its lowest primary vote numbers in this state since the party&#x27;s foundation in this election, while the Liberal party recorded some of its strongest. Queensland was the poorest state electorally for the Greens, while One Nation also suffered a 5.1% reduction in their primary vote.&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

===Western Australia===

&lt;section begin=&quot;WA infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;WA infobox&quot; /&gt;

Western Australia saw two seats change hands. The Liberal vote has always been considered strong in this state. It was made stronger in this election due to Kim Beazley&#x27;s absence as Labor leader. Beazley, a native Western Australian was seen to bolster Labor&#x27;s poll numbers when he stood in 1998 and 2001. This and the unpopular Labor state Geoff Gallop government of the time saw Labor&#x27;s polling numbers slide to its lowest since 1977.&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

===South Australia===

&lt;section begin=&quot;SA infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;SA infobox&quot; /&gt;

The redistribution saw South Australia lose one seat. This election saw four seats change hands; however, there was no net change in party representation. The Liberal vote rose slightly, as did Labor&#x27;s (3.1% since 2001). While the Greens recorded a result of 5.4%.

===Tasmania===

&lt;section begin=&quot;Tas infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;Tas infobox&quot; /&gt;

Labor to Liberal: Bass Braddon

Tasmania bucked the national trend against Labor. The party still lost two seats but maintained a primary vote of 44.6%. The Liberal party saw its primary vote jump 5.9% to 42.0%, and the Greens saw their strongest nationwide results capturing 9.9% of the vote.&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

== Interpretation of results ==

The popularity of John Howard as prime minister and the ineffectiveness of Mark Latham as an opposition leader was what ultimately drove the Coalition&#x27;s electoral success. The lack of viable alternatives as prime minister in the Coalition government helped consolidate this.

In the Howard government&#x27;s third term, there had been the widely held view that the economy had been performing well, and economic security had increased. These economic circumstances were unusual for Australia following a tumultuous decade previously, one which saw a recession occur. This bolstered Howard&#x27;s popularity, an opposition only stood a chance of making significant inroads against a leader much less popular than Howard.

Latham ran at times a scrappy campaign, announcing policy at unusual times and often without the consultation of his party room. Howard exploited this and succeeded in portraying him as inexperienced and risky. He also disregarded connecting to business or financial leaders, something which was viewed by many as a miscalculation.

The two main policy areas that dominated campaigning were that of international security (Iraq War, terrorism) and economic security. They did sway votes and drove people to defect from either party, but to a lesser extent. In polls conducted it was found that 82% of people opposed the war, yet only 4% listed it as their primary issue. Support for the war followed an unusual trajectory. Initially, the country&#x27;s engagement in a war alongside Britain and the United States was met with outrage in the community. However, once Australia had committed troops to the war, public opinion began shifting. Public support for the war became largely positive in late 2003. There were many people who objected to it on a moral basis but relatively few cared enough to change their vote at the ballot box.

Labor frequently attacked the coalition on their record of providing adequate social services such as Medicare, education funding and social welfare. Policies were announced aimed at addressing these and this resonated with voters. Under the view of many in the electorate, these services had seen decline under the three terms of the coalition. School funding received particular attention with Latham announcing a bold remodelling of how federal funding would be split amongst independent and public schools. Latham suggested that elite private schools, some of the most expensive in the country, would have their funding slashed and redistributed to lower socioeconomic independent schools and government schools. This was seen by many as a departure from modern day political campaigning and a return to old fashioned class-warfare type politics. The media portrayed the policy dishonestly, describing it as removing all private school funding. This wasn&#x27;t true, the policy ensured that the pool of independent funding remained but was distributed more to low-income schools. Nevertheless, Latham would be scalded in the media for adopting the policy with Victoria&#x27;s Herald Sun running an editorial against him stating &quot;Mr Latham&#x27;s commitments are based on the fallacious, ideologically driven premise that all parents who send their children to so called wealthy schools are themselves rich&quot;.

The Coalition successfully countered these by running a campaign around interest rates stating that the spending envisaged by a Labor government would inevitably see interest rates increase. The &quot;Keep interest rates low&quot; campaign ran by the Coalition reminded the electorate frequently about the double digit interest rates that existed under the Hawke/Keating Labor governments in the 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s. Labor decided to counter this by quoting a Reuters survey of 14 financial market economists that stated the party in government would make no difference to the level of interest rates over the next term of government. Many in Australia had borrowed heavily at the time to finance their home ownership and were swayed by this line of campaigning by Howard. They were justifiably nervous about their future financial prospects and voted accordingly. People saw the risk of foreclosure as a greater threat than the risk of sub-standard healthcare services or an inequitable public education sector.

<text>John Andreas Widtsoe (; January 31, 1872 – November 29, 1952) was a Norwegian-American scientist, author, and religious leader who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1921 until his death in 1952.

==Early life==
Widtsoe was born on the island of Frøya in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. At birth his hand was attached to the side of his head, but he had an operation to correct this problem. When Widtsoe was two, his family moved to the Norwegian mainland city of Namsos. His father, also named John, died in February 1878. This left his mother, Anna, as a widow with two young sons to take care of: six-year-old John, and his younger brother Osborne Widtsoe. The family moved to Trondheim, where they were introduced to the LDS Church by a shoemaker.

In 1883, Widtsoe immigrated to the United States with his mother and brother. They arrived in Utah Territory in mid-November. Widtsoe was baptized a member of the LDS Church the following April.

==Education==
Widtsoe graduated from Brigham Young College in Logan, Utah. He attended Harvard University, graduating with honors in 1894.

In 1898, Widtsoe was ordained to the office of seventy and set apart to do missionary work in connection with his studies in Europe. He entered the University of Göttingen, Germany, and graduated with the degrees of AM and PhD in 1899. For part of his time in Europe, Widtsoe lived in Switzerland. The police wanted proof that he and his wife were married, and since they had neglected to bring their American wedding certificate with them, they were married a second time.

==Academic career==

In August 1900, Widtsoe became the director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Utah State Agricultural College. While in this position, he founded &quot;The Deseret Farmer&quot; with Lewis A. Merrill and J. Edward Taylor. Their goal was to have it be a popular magazine that would be read and used by farmers.

In 1905, Widtsoe was dismissed from the agricultural college as a result of political debates about its future and feelings of William Jasper Kerr, the university&#x27;s president, that Widtsoe was insufficiently supporting him.

For a short time, Widtsoe was a professor of agriculture at Brigham Young University (BYU), and is arguably the founding father of BYU&#x27;s college of biology and agriculture. (Previously on the BYU campus, the John A. Widtsoe Building was the home of the College of Biology and Agriculture. A new building, the Life Sciences Building, took its place in 2014). Soon, however, he returned to Logan and succeeded Kerr as president of Utah State Agricultural College; he served in this position from 1907 to 1916. He also served as the president of the University of Utah from 1916 until his call as a member of the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve in 1921. Widtsoe was the fifth Commissioner of Church Education from 1921 to 1924 and was the seventh commissioner from 1934 to 1936.

During his time as an apostle, Widtsoe taught a religion class at the University of Southern California.

==Federal government work==
For two years in the 1920s, Widtsoe lived in Washington, D.C., where he supervised the reorganization of the Federal Bureau of Reclamation.

==Service in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles==
Widtsoe was closely associated with the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; even before he became an apostle. He was associate editor of the magazine from 1935 until 1952. As editor of the &quot;Improvement Era&quot;, Widtsoe &quot;directed its growth from a magazine primarily for the youth to the voice of the whole Church&quot;. One of Widtsoe&#x27;s employees while at the magazine was Hugh Nibley, who Widtsoe convinced to become a professor at BYU.

Widtsoe was also a member of the church&#x27;s Genealogy Committee, where he pushed for creation and adoption of the Temple Index Bureau.

===Missions to Europe===
In 1923, Widtsoe accompanied fellow apostle, Reed Smoot, on a journey to Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, during which they secured recognition and opened the way for missionaries of the church to return to these lands.

From 1926 until 1932, Widtsoe served as president of the European Mission. While in this office, he convinced the First Presidency to call a separate president of the British Mission, so that the president of the European Mission could focus on supervising the missions in continental Europe. While president of the European Mission, Widtsoe dedicated Czechoslovakia for the preaching of the gospel, and worked closely with Arthur Gaeth in starting the mission there.

==Marriage and writings==
Widtsoe married Leah Dunford, a daughter of Susa Young Gates, who was a daughter of LDS Church president Brigham Young. Their first child, Ann Gaarden Widtsoe, was born in Germany. The couple had eight children, but only three lived to adulthood. Widtsoe worked closely with his wife and mother-in-law on a biography of Young. Widtsoe also edited a book containing Young&#x27;s significant teachings. Widtsoe was also the lead compiler of &quot;Gospel Doctrine&quot;, a collection of sermons and teachings of LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith.

Widtsoe and his wife authored &quot;The Word of Wisdom: A Modern Interpretation&quot;, a book which advocates the incorporation of healthy eating habits into the Word of Wisdom.

Widtsoe wrote &quot;A Rational Theology as Taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, which has been cited by later LDS authors such as J. Reuben Clark. He also wrote &quot;Evidences and Reconciliations&quot;, which was a compilation of his &quot;Improvement Era&quot; writings, answering common questions on matters of faith. In this work, Widtsoe acknowledges that there are multiple interpretations that Latter-day Saints can hold on certain issues. One example is his explanation of the time involved in the creation of the earth: he indicated that faithful Latter-day Saints could hold the &quot;six-day&quot;, &quot;six-thousand-years&quot;, or the &quot;undefined-period&quot; interpretations of the creation. Although Widtsoe focused on explaining the rationale for the &quot;undefined-period&quot; interpretation, he did not belittle the other two or state that they were unorthodox.

In 1939, Widtsoe published &quot;Priesthood and Church Welfare&quot; and &quot;Priesthood and Church Government&quot;. His work, &quot;The Message of the Doctrine and Covenants&quot;, was edited by son-in-law G. Homer Durham, and published after Widtsoe&#x27;s death. Widtsoe wrote &quot;Seven Claims of the Book of Mormon: A Collection of Evidences&quot; with Franklin S. Harris, Jr.

Widtsoe wrote a biography of Joseph Smith entitled &quot;Joseph Smith: Seeker After Truth Prophet of God&quot;. It was published in 1951, and reprinted by Bookcraft in 1957. Widtsoe also wrote &quot;Joseph Smith as Scientist: A Contribution to Mormon Philosophy&quot;, published by the Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association in 1908. In 1944, his essay, &quot;The Divine Mission of Joseph Smith&quot;, was included in &quot;Handbook of the Restoration&quot; published by Zion&#x27;s Printing and Publishing Company in Independence, Missouri.

Non-religious books by Widtsoe include &quot;Dry-Farming: A System of Agriculture for Countries Under a Low Rainfall&quot; (New York: MacMillan, 1920) and &quot;Dodge&#x27;s Geography of Utah&quot;.

Widtsoe wrote two autobiographies. The first, &quot;In the Gospel Net&quot;, largely focused on his mother&#x27;s conversion to the LDS Church. The second, &quot;In a Sunlit Land&quot;, told the story of his later life, and included explanations of his educational philosophy.

==Hymns==
Widtsoe wrote the texts to the hymns &quot;Lead Me into Life Eternal&quot; and &quot;How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True,&quot; which appear as numbers 45 and 126 respectively in the 1985 LDS hymnal.

==Death==

Widtsoe died in Salt Lake City, of uremia; he also had prostate cancer for several years before his death. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Adam S. Bennion filled the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve following Widtsoe&#x27;s death.

<text>Joseph Francis Merrill (August 24, 1868 – February 3, 1952) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1931 until his death.

Merrill was a key figure in the development of the Church Educational System in the early twentieth century. He served as the sixth Commissioner of Church Education from 1928 to 1933. Prior to his service as commissioner, he played a significant role in the creation of the LDS Church&#x27;s &quot;released time&quot; seminary system. His tenure as commissioner also saw creation of the Institutes of Religion and the transfer of nearly all the remaining church schools to control of the states they resided in. He also faced a crisis in 1930 and 1931 which threatened to end the released time seminary, but the LDS Church education system survived the Great Depression under his leadership. In 1931, while still serving as commissioner, Merrill was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

==Early life==

Merrill was born in Richmond, Utah Territory. He was a great-grandson of noted Mormon pioneer Stillman Pond, grandson of church Patriarch Joseph C. Kingsbury, and the son of LDS Church apostle Marriner W. Merrill. Joseph was among the first Latter-day Saints from Utah to travel to the eastern United States to seek higher education. He studied at the University of Deseret, the University of Michigan, and Johns Hopkins University; he was the first native Utahn to receive a Ph.D. While at the University of Michigan, Merrill was the president of the Ann Arbor Branch of the LDS Church. In 1911, Merrill was called to serve in the presidency of the Granite Utah Stake of the LDS Church.

Upon his return to Utah, in 1893, Merrill began teaching physics and assisting in chemistry at the University of Utah. In 1895, he became the first principal of the newly established School of Mines, now the University of Utah College of Engineering. (The Merrill Engineering building on the University of Utah campus is named in his honor.)

Although the University of Utah established the mining school in the 1890s, it was little more than a basic assay and geology course until after increased funding in 1901. From then to 1928, when Merrill left, the school slowly emerged as one of the best of the mining engineering schools in the American West. Professor Merrill&#x27;s career as head of the University of Utah School of Mines coincided with a rapid growth in the Utah mining industry. Major scientific discoveries and technological innovations brought the industry out of the era of the lone-prospector and small company mine and mill operation to a world dominated by multi-national corporations working on massive scales, which required a large body of degreed mining engineers, metallurgists, industrial chemists, and other college-educated workers. Early graduates of the program quickly found work in the industry, nearby then globally.

In 1913, Merrill successfully attracted funding for a metallurgical research center cooperatively staffed by the university and by the new U. S. Bureau of Mines. The Utah experiment station funded original research by students, who received fellowships, as well as university faculty and staff members of the U. S. Bureau of Mines. Breakthroughs in understanding of the flotation process, cyanide extraction process, of radium (by Samuel C. Lind), and a host of other topics including smelter smoke abatement studies were major contributions in the field. During Merrill&#x27;s tenure the School of Mines also expanded to offer additional degrees in engineering, including civil engineering, electrical engineering, and chemical engineering. During the mid-1910s, the School of Mines of the University of Utah added &quot;and engineering school&quot; to its name. In 1928, the university determined the funds for mining and metallurgy research were better spent elsewhere, and the cuts caused staff to leave, such as Antoine Marc Gaudin, a leading metallurgical scientist who left for MIT. Prof. Merrill retired that year as well.

In 1898, Merrill married Annie Laura Hyde, the daughter of Alonzo Hyde and Annie Taylor Hyde. Merrill and his wife would become the parents of seven children. Their home was part of the social life of students in the early mining engineering classes.

==Church education role==
Upon hearing his wife relate stories from the Book of Mormon she had learned in a class taught by James E. Talmage, Merrill began to seek means for students attending public high schools to have some form of weekday religious education. Influenced by Christian seminaries he had seen at the University of Chicago, Merrill worked with the Granite School Board and the Church General Board of Education to secure the necessary funding and legal rights to open an LDS seminary next to Granite High School. In his search for a proper teacher to instruct the youth, Merrill wrote:

Merrill found the right man in Thomas J. Yates, a young engineer in the Granite Stake. After the building completed and the curriculum developed, the first released-time LDS seminary opened its doors in 1912.

In 1928, Merrill left his position at the University of Utah to serve as the head of the LDS Church school system. Upon Merrill&#x27;s acceptance, the name of the position was officially changed from &quot;Superintendent of Church Schools&quot; to &quot;Church Commissioner of Education&quot;. As commissioner, Merrill faced several unique challenges.

Merrill took over the development of the first institute program at Moscow, Idaho. Working with J. Wyley Sessions, Merrill helped develop the basic goals of the institute program, which he felt should be designed to help students reconcile the secular learning of university with the spiritual truths of the church. He wrote:

In this collegiate seminary work we are, of course, starting on a new thing in the Church. But if we keep the objective clearly in mind it may be helpful. And may I say that this objective, as I see it, is to enable our young people attending the colleges to make the necessary adjustments between the things they have been taught in the Church and the things they are learning in the university, to enable them to become firmly settled in their faith as members of the Church. The big question, then, is what means and methods can be employed to help them to make these reconciliations and adjustments. The primary purpose, therefore, is not to teach them theology. It is not to prepare them for seminary teachers or preachers of the Gospel. We should, therefore, continually hold before our minds that we want to hold them in the Church, make them active, intelligent, sincere, Latter-day Saints. We want to keep them from growing cold in the faith and indifferent to their obligations as Church members. We want to help them to see that it is perfectly reasonable and logical to be really sincere Latter-day Saints.

With the successful launch of institute, Merrill&#x27;s next task was to facilitate the withdrawal of the LDS Church from the field of secular education in the United States. Most of the church schools had already been closed in the early 1920s, but Brigham Young University (BYU) and several junior colleges remained under church control. In a meeting of the Church General Board of Education in February 1929, Merrill was asked to begin the process of closing all of the remaining schools. Despite the onset of the Great Depression, Merrill was able to successfully negotiate with the Utah State Legislature to ensure the successful transfer of Weber, Snow and Dixie Colleges from the LDS Church to Utah. In Arizona, Gila College was also transferred to the state and was later renamed Eastern Arizona College. When the Idaho legislature rejected an offer to take control of Ricks College, Merrill worked to ensure its survival as a private school, despite seriously diminished funding. Merrill also worked with other church leaders to keep BYU under church control. He felt that maintaining one university was vital for the future training of seminary teachers. He saw the value in maintaining a corps of trained scholars who were well versed in the teachings of the church. In addition, he felt that a church university would be a light to the world, functioning as a showcase for the academic achievements of church members.

In 1930, state high school inspector I. L. Williamson issued a highly critical report on the relationships between LDS seminaries and public high schools in Utah. Influenced by this report, the Utah State Board of Education moved to suspend released time privileges statewide. Merrill worked to ensure the continuation of released time, speaking before the State Board to in an attempt to convince them of the benefits and legality of seminary. When the Board voted on the issue in 1931, both released time and credit for Bible study were retained. With most of the LDS Church-run schools eliminated by this point, Merrill&#x27;s action ensured the survival of what would become the dominant form of religious education for the church in Utah.

Merrill also dealt with the effects of the Great Depression, cutting costs in education. Rather than laying off employees, Merrill asked all members of church education to take pay cuts. During his service, church spending on education was cut nearly in half.

Despite the hard times he saw during his tenure as commissioner, Merrill took great joy in his work. Upon his call as commissioner he said:

Again may I say that I believe there is no kind of education in the world that is so fine and so elevating and so good and so important as religious education. And I believe that nowhere in the world is there a system of religious education that is equal in its quality, in its thoroughness and in its comprehensiveness to the system of education that is being undertaken in this Church. The time will come, I verily believe, and before very many years, when week-day religious education will be offered to every high school boy and girl, to every college and university boy and girl in this Church.

==Mission president==
When Merrill left Utah in 1933 to serve as president of the European Mission of the church, he passed his fiscal philosophies on to the missionaries serving under him. One of them, future apostle and church president Gordon B. Hinckley, cited Merrill&#x27;s influence as a major factor in his own financial thinking. J. Wyley Sessions called Merrill the &quot;most economical, conservative General Authority of this dispensation.&quot;

==Later life==
Merrill served as an apostle until his death in 1952 in Salt Lake City from coronary thrombosis. Upon his death, fellow apostle Joseph Fielding Smith offered the following tribute: &quot;I marveled at his energy. Apparently he never got tired; he loved the truth. He loved the truth of science, but he loved more the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ ... He had a strong will, was pronounced in his opinions, but he was always submissive to the majority decisions of his brethren.&quot; Merrill was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<doc id="1072682" wikidata="Q5074813" url="?curid=1072682" title="Charles A. Callis">
<text>Charles Albert Callis (4 May 1865 – 21 January 1947) was a leader and missionary in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was ordained an apostle by church president Heber J. Grant on October 12, 1933, and remained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until his death.

== Early life ==
Callis was born on 4 May 1865, in Dublin, Ireland, to John and Susannah Charlotte Callis. While living in England, Callis met LDS Church missionaries in Liverpool and joined the church along with his three siblings and their widowed mother. The Callis family immigrated to the Utah Territory in 1875 and settled in Davis County, Utah, first in Bountiful and later in Centerville. At age 16, Callis moved to Coalville in Summit County, where he worked in the coal mines for 11 years.

His mother later married Thomas Wallace Williams on July 25, 1878, and they had several children.

In 1891, Callis was elected constable of Coalville. In 1892, he served as a missionary in Wyoming under the direction of the Summit Stake. From December 1892 until June 1895, he served as a missionary in the British Isles, including time in the Liverpool Conference. He later served as a missionary in Iowa.

In 1896, at the age of 31, Callis was elected to the Utah House of Representatives; he served in the 1st Utah State Legislature. In 1898, Callis became the attorney for Summit County.

In 1902, Callis married Grace Elizabeth Pack, a granddaughter of John Pack, and they were the parents of eight children.

== Missions ==
Callis, his wife, and their two daughters moved to Florida in 1905 to perform missionary work. Callis was soon admitted to the Florida bar, and he worked to defend church missionaries in legal cases, such as the 1907 case against George Perry in Darlington, South Carolina. In 1907, the Callis family returned home to Utah, but were almost immediately sent back to the southern United States, this time with Callis appointed to head the South Carolina Conference.

In 1908, Callis was called as president of the church&#x27;s Southern States Mission, succeeding Ben E. Rich. He held this position until his call as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve in 1933. When he began his tenure as mission president, he presided over 250 missionaries spread across 10 states.

==Apostle==
Callis became an LDS Church apostle on 12 October 1933, filling the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve created by the death of James E. Talmage. Callis served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve until his death, with Henry D. Moyle filling the vacancy created by his death.

Richard E. Bennett wrote of Callis: &quot;Today Elder Charles A. Callis is an almost forgotten figure among younger members of the Church. Yet to those who knew him, he was utterly memorable.&quot; Nephi Jensen, a fellow missionary who worked with him in Jacksonville, Florida, wrote:

C. A. Callis in many respects [is] a very remarkable man. He is one of those heroic souls who have come up from the depths. A few years ago he was working in a coal mine in Utah, now he is a practicing attorney and has been admitted to the bar in two states. Without opportunities or aid from friends he has risen by the sovereignty of his determination to an enviable station in life. He not only acquired a knowledge of law by self effort but read widely on general subjects and trained himself in the art of public speaking. He is an able, pleasing and convincing orator.

The guiding light and inspiration for Callis was always Jesus Christ. He once said, “From my earliest recollections to the present time I have always had an abiding and intense love for my Savior. I cannot read the story of His sufferings and crucifixion without shedding tears.

As an apostle, Callis authored one book, &quot;Fundamentals of Religion&quot; (Deseret Book, 1945), a collection of seventeen lectures about the tenets of the LDS Church he gave over national radio in 1943.

==Death==
Callis died of a massive heart attack on 21 January 1947. His wife&#x27;s death, which had occurred in October 1946, deeply affected Callis, and he never fully recovered from that loss. Callis died in Jacksonville, Florida, at the age of 81, the day after meetings were held to organize the church&#x27;s first stake in the Southern United States. He referred to this event as the &quot;crowning achievement&quot; of his life. The day before he died, Callis told many at the church meeting that he saw his wife many times everywhere he went. That night, he wrote to his daughter: &quot;The Lord gave me strength to go through with the organization. With his aid I am battling through. I feel that your mother is not far from us.&quot; Funeral services for Callis were held both in Jacksonville and in Salt Lake City. He was buried in Salt Lake City Cemetery.

==Quotes==
&quot;The awakening of the conscience is the grandeur of the soul.&quot;

&quot;In far too many cases riches and their owners change places—the riches own the owners. Money will become the master if it is not made to be the servant.&quot;

“The greatest thrilling experience that you and I can ever have in our hearts will be on those occasions when deep down we receive the witness that our acts and our labors are approved by our Heavenly Father.”

&quot;This is the world in which to cultivate righteous tendencies and just causes that will produce, in the world to come, results and harvests of perfection and heavenly fruit.&quot;

==Memorials==
There is a plaque in St. Audoen&#x27;s Park, Dublin, to commemorate the Birthplace of Callis.

<text>Hogar CREA is an international drug rehabilitation institution founded in Puerto Rico. It is often referred to in the plural, Hogares CREA.

==History==
In 1968, José Juan García founded Hogar CREA. The acronym is for a Spanish phrase, meaning &#x27;community for the re-education of addicts&#x27;; is also a word meaning &#x27;creates&#x27;, and translates to &#x27;Home Creates&#x27;.

Participants were required to attend church services on Sundays until a court ruling changed that. Participants are known for selling desserts such as caramel custards. They also wash cars and do community service. The program is funded by both the United States federal government and the Puerto Rican government.

Hogares CREA has over 152 facilities worldwide. Besides Puerto Rico, facilities are also established in Florida, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Panama, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

<text>Sylvester Quayle Cannon (June 10, 1877 – May 29, 1943) was an American businessman, engineer, and religious leader who served as the sixth presiding bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1925 to 1938 and a member of church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1939 until his death. He was the son of George Q. Cannon, an apostle and member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency.

==Biography==
Cannon was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He studied at the University of Utah and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a B.S. degree in mining engineering.

In 1899, Cannon began an LDS Church mission in Belgium. Cannon then served from 1900 to 1902 as president of the church&#x27;s Netherlands–Belgium Mission. Cannon also served as Francis M. Lyman&#x27;s secretary on a three-month trip to many nations along the Mediterranean and in the Middle East.

From 1916 to 1925, Cannon served as president of the Pioneer Stake in Salt Lake City.

In 1925, Cannon became the Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church, succeeding Charles W. Nibley. Cannon&#x27;s counselors were David A. Smith and John Wells.

In 1938, Cannon was released as Presiding Bishop and was succeeded by LeGrand Richards. At the same time, Cannon was ordained an apostle and made an &quot;associate&quot; of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a unique position that had never been filled before. When Quorum member Melvin J. Ballard died the next year, Cannon became a full member of the Quorum; he served in this position until his death.

Cannon died in Salt Lake City from encephalomalacia, or softening of the brain. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<text>The Alsea Bay Bridge is a concrete arch bridge that spans the Alsea Bay on U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Waldport, Oregon.

==History==

There have been two bridges on this site.

The first bridge was designed by Conde McCullough and opened in 1936. It was a reinforced-concrete combination deck and through arch bridge.

The hostile environment caused significant corrosion to the steel reinforcements. In 1972 the Oregon Department of Transportation began projects aimed at extending the life of the bridge. By the mid-1980s it was decided to replace the bridge rather than continue costly rehabilitation efforts. The first bridge was demolished in 1991.
Construction of the second bridge, designed by HNTB, began in 1988, and it was opened in the fall of 1991 at a cost of $42.4 million. The bridge is in total length, with a main span that provides of vertical clearance. The bridge has a latex concrete deck and the piers are significantly thicker than normal in an attempt to thwart corrosion. Its life expectancy is 75 to 100 years.

<text>Carmine Appice ( ; born December 15, 1946) is an American rock drummer. He is best known for his associations with Vanilla Fudge; Cactus; the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice; Rod Stewart; King Kobra; and Blue Murder. He is also Vinny Appice&#x27;s older brother. Appice was inducted into the &quot;Classic Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2014 and the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2014. He is also a bass player. 

His best-selling drum instruction book &quot;The Realistic Rock Drum Method&quot;. was first published in 1972 and has since been revised and republished as &quot;The Ultimate Realistic Rock Drum Method&quot;. It covers the basic subjects of rock rhythms and polyrhythms, linear rudiments and groupings, shuffle rhythms, hi-hat and double bass drum exercises. Appice has claimed that he influenced John Bonham&#x27;s use of bass drum triplets.

==Career==
Appice received classical music training, and was influenced early on by the work of jazz drummers Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. Appice first came to prominence as the drummer with the late 1960s psychedelic band Vanilla Fudge. He contributed distinctive background harmonies with bassist Tim Bogert. After five albums, the pair left Vanilla Fudge to form the blues rock quartet Cactus, with vocalist Rusty Day and guitarist Jim McCarty. Appice and Bogert then left Cactus to join Jeff Beck in the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice. Appice joined Rod Stewart&#x27;s backing band in 1976 co-writing songs such as &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; and &quot;Young Turks&quot;. He also played drums on a track on Paul Stanley&#x27;s eponymous solo album (1978).

He was a member of KGB, which featured Ray Kennedy, Ric Grech, Mike Bloomfield and Barry Goldberg. Appice has recorded with artists such as Stanley Clarke, Ted Nugent and Pink Floyd. He has also played with King Kobra and (alongside John Sykes) in Blue Murder. On May 23, 1981, Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los Angeles, proclaimed that day as Carmine Appice Day in the city, in recognition of the drummer&#x27;s charitable and educational work. In late 1983 Appice toured with Ozzy Osbourne in support of his Gold-selling &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; album, but shortly afterward was fired from the backing group. Though Osbourne had a good relationship with him, the singer&#x27;s wife and manager Sharon detested Appice, and the decision to fire him was strictly hers.

Appice recorded &quot;Caso Cerrado&quot; (1995) with the Argentine guitarist Pappo. They were also joined by bassist Tim Bogert on four songs, including &quot;P. B. A. Boogie&quot;. He spent 1999 touring Japan with Bogert and Char in a unit called CB&amp;A, with a live album released the following year. In 2000, Appice formed the power trio DBA with Bogert and Rick Derringer, and was reunited once again with Bogert when they reformed Vanilla Fudge.

In 2005, he became an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization which provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in less privileged public schools throughout the USA. He has personally delivered instruments to children in the program and has also performed at benefit concerts for the organization and sits on its Honorary board of directors.

In 2006, he formed the drum ensemble SLAMM in which Appice participated on drums playing alongside four young drummers; the resulting show has been described as &quot;Stomp on steroids&quot;. The band filmed a promotional video for the Cable Network station ESPN, using a NASCAR garage as a set and mechanics&#x27; hardware as instruments. SLAMM was voted as the runner-up in the &quot;Drum&quot; magazine poll for Percussion Ensemble (2008) after a special appearance at the magazine&#x27;s drum festival. The group also appears on the Modern Drummer festival DVD (2008).

He recorded &quot;Carmine Appice&#x27;s Guitar Zeus: Conquering Heroes&quot; (2009). This was the third album in his &quot;Guitar Zeus&quot; series. These albums have featured guitarists such as Jennifer Batten, Brian May, Ted Nugent, Richie Sambora and Yngwie Malmsteen.

Carmine Appice lives in New York with his longtime girlfriend, radio personality Leslie Gold, The Radiochick.

He lent his talents to the Sly Stone CD &quot;I&#x27;m Back! Family &amp; Friends&quot;, on which he plays on the Sly classic &quot;Stand!&quot; It was released on August 16, 2011.

2011–2012 saw Carmine performing Drum Wars shows with his brother Vinny Appice and guitarist Michael Hund, as well a reformation of King Kobra with Johnny Rod, Mick Sweda, and David Henzerling, with Paul Shortino replacing Marcie Free on lead vocals. This lineup released an eponymous album, &quot;King Kobra&quot;, in April 2011 on the Frontiers label, which received critical acclaim. A new King Kobra album was released in 2013, titled &quot;King Kobra II&quot;, featuring the song &quot;Have a Good Time&quot;, for which a music video was filmed in the fall of 2012 at Count&#x27;s Vamp&#x27;d in Las Vegas Valley.

Appice published his memoir, &quot;Stick It!: My Life of Sex, Drums &amp; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, in 2016.

Appice was set to play with Vinnie Vincent in a mini-reunion show slated originally for December 2018 but moved to February 2019 before ultimately being completely canceled.

In 2021, Appice released &quot;Energy Overload&quot;. The album is credited to Appice Perdomo Project which is a collaboration with Multi Instrumentalist Fernando Perdomo.

<text>Proposition 59 (or Senate Constitutional Amendment 1) was an amendment of the Constitution of California that introduced freedom of information or &quot;sunshine&quot; provisions. It was proposed by the California Legislature and overwhelmingly approved by the voters in an initiative held as part of the November 2004 elections.

==Approval by the people==
Proposition 59 was approved by the State Legislature as Senate Constitutional Amendment 1 of the 2003–2004 Regular Session (Resolution Chapter 1, Statutes of 2004). It was adopted by the California State Senate by a vote of 34-0 and the State Assembly by 78-0. It was then put to voters as a ballot proposition on 2 November 2004. It passed with 9,334,852 (83.4%) votes in favor and 1,870,146 (16.6%) against.

==Text==
The amendment adds to the state constitution Article I, Section 3 (b). Section 3 (a) is the provision of the Declaration of Rights that guarantees the right to freedom of assembly, the right to petition the government and the right to instruct one&#x27;s elected representatives. The amendment added to these rights the following provisions:

==Official summary==
The official summary of Proposition 59 states that the purpose of the amendment is to
The Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate predicted only &quot;potential minor annual state and local government costs to make additional information available to the public&quot;.

==Explanation of provisions==
According to The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press the effects of the amendment may be summarized roughly as follows:
*First, it mandates access to government records and meetings of government bodies, and elevates this right of access to constitutional stature. Thus, all newly enacted state laws and administrative regulations must conform to the Amendment&#x27;s provisions. The effect is to leave no doubt as to the importance of access to the people of California, and consequently to render ineffective the assertion, often made by government agencies to defeat access, that access in a particular case serves no public purpose. Similarly, it strengthens the case for access in cases where, under existing statutory exemptions, records can be withheld when the public&#x27;s interest in non-disclosure clearly outweighs the public&#x27;s interest in disclosure. This is so because most interests in non-disclosure are not constitutionally based and thus will be of significantly less importance when weighed against a now-constitutional right of access.
*Second, unlike statutory rights of access under California&#x27;s Public Records Act and The Ralph M. Brown Act, the Sunshine Amendment applies not just to the executive branch of government but to the judicial and legislative branches as well. While the Amendment expressly reserves existing protections for proceedings and records of the Legislature and rules adopted in furtherance of those protections, and maintains all other preexisting constitutional and statutory exemptions to the right of access to public records and meetings, these branches of government are now within the mantle of the public&#x27;s constitutional right of access. In practice, what new rights of access this may bring remains to be determined, but arguably the right would include access to records and meetings of both the Legislature and the Judiciary not currently exempt from disclosure under existing authority.
*Third, the Sunshine Amendment requires that court rules, statutes, or other authority be construed broadly when they further the public&#x27;s right of access, and narrowly when they limit that right.
*Fourth, when public bodies adopt new laws, court rules, or other authority that limit the right of access, they must now make express findings demonstrating the interest purportedly protected and the need for protecting that interest. Thus, the adoption of agency rules and regulations, for example, intended to impede public access will no longer be allowed on the whim of the agency&#x27;s governing body but will require actual on-the-record findings demonstrating the need for secrecy and demonstrating how the exemption will achieve that need—findings similar to that required by a court before sealing a court record or closing a court proceeding.
*Lastly, the Sunshine Amendment leaves intact the right of privacy guaranteed by the constitution by clarifying that it does not supersede or modify the existing constitutional right of privacy. And, disconcerting for proponents of access, the Amendment expressly does not affect existing statutory protections afforded peace officers over information concerning their official performance or professional qualifications.

<text>Galarrwuy Yunupingu (30 June 1948 – 3 April 2023), also known as James Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Dr Yunupingu, was an Indigenous Australian activist who was a leader in the Aboriginal Australian community. He was involved in Indigenous land rights throughout his career. He was a Yolngu man of the Gumatj clan, from Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. He was the 1978 Australian of the Year.

== Early life and education ==
Galarrwuy Yunupingu was born at Melville Bay, near Yirrkala, on 30 June 1948, and was a member of the Gumatj clan of the Yolngu people. His father, Mungurrawuy Yunupingu, was a well-known artist and leader of his clan; siblings included lead singer of Yothu Yindi, his brother Mandawuy Yunupingu; and several artist sisters, including Nyapanyapa Yunupingu and Nancy Gaymala Yunupingu.

He attended the Mission School at Yirrkala in his formative years, and moved to Brisbane to study at the Methodist Bible College for two years, returning to Gove in 1967.

== Career ==
=== Land rights ===

In the early 1960s, with his father, Gumatj clan leader Mungurrawuy, Yunupingu entered the struggle for land rights and helped draw up the Yirrkala bark petitions, which his father helped to paint. He came to national attention in the late 1960s for his role in the landmark, but unsuccessful Gove Land Rights Case. This legal action was the first by Indigenous Australians to challenge mining companies&#x27; rights to exploit traditional lands. He became a prominent leader and strong voice on behalf of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and Australia, gaining the respect and admiration from many.
In 1975, Yunupingu joined the Northern Land Council (NLC), the authority appointed under the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot; to represent traditional Aboriginal landowners and Aboriginal people. He was chairman of the NLC from 1977 to 1980, an executive member until 1983 when he was re-elected as chairman. He has led a number of negotiations with mining and government bodies.

In 1988, Yunupingu and Wenten Rubuntja presented prime minister Bob Hawke, who was on a visit to the Northern Territory as part of Bicentennial celebrations, with a statement of Aboriginal political objectives, painted on a sheet of composite wood. This became known as the &quot;Barunga Statement&quot;. Hawke responded by saying that he wished to conclude a treaty between Aboriginal and other Australians by 1990. In June 1991 the Aboriginal band, Yothu Yindi, whose lead singer was Yunupingu&#x27;s younger brother Mandawuy Yunupingu, wrote and released the hit song &quot;Treaty&quot; to commemorate the Barunga statement. The brothers and the band wanted to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the federal government. 

As chair of the NLC, Yunupingu led the Gagudju people in negotiations with mining and government bodies. Not opposed to mining in principle, Yunupingu saw it as a way for Aboriginal people to escape the welfare trap if it is conducted on the traditional owners&#x27; terms. These include a fair distribution of the economic benefits and respect for the land and specific sacred sites. He said: &quot;We will continue to fight for the right to make our own decisions about our own land&quot;.

=== Later career ===
In October 2004, Yunupingu resigned from his position as chair of the NLC after 23 years in the role and around 28 as a member of the council. In June 2005 &quot;The Weekend Australian&quot;, based on information provided by his son and other relatives, reported that there was some discontent among the Yunupingu family and other community members about the distribution of mining royalties paid to the Gumatj Association.

In 2007 Yunupingu spoke about the need for action in reducing Indigenous poverty. In reference to the Howard government&#x27;s Northern Territory National Emergency Response, known as &quot;The Intervention&quot;, he said &quot;The intervention was an incomplete process about which he would reserve his judgement until he knew what was working and what wasn&#x27;t&quot;. In 2009 he spoke out against the inability of the government to provide adequate housing.

As of early 2009, he continued to live near Yirrkala, fulfilling his role as a senior ceremonial leader and community elder. He still held numerous positions on committees and organisations where he was able to share his wide experience with other Australians and promote the aspirations of his people.

Yunupingu was a member of the Referendum Council set up in 2015, which led to the &quot;Uluru Statement from the Heart&quot; in 2017. In November 2019, it was announced that Yunupingu would be one of 20 members of the Senior Advisory Group to help co-design the Indigenous voice to government set up by Ken Wyatt, the Minister for Indigenous Australians. The Group is co-chaired by Wyatt, Marcia Langton and Tom Calma.

==Music==
Yunupingu loved music and helped to guide his brother&#x27;s band, Yothu Yindi, sometimes singing traditional elements of the band&#x27;s songs. He also painted their album covers.

In the early 1970s, Yunupingu sang a song written by Ted Egan, called &quot;Gurindji Blues&quot;, about the struggles of the land rights movement in the NT at the time. Released on RCA Victor in 1971, the single features Vincent Lingiari of Gurindji strike fame, who introduces the recording in Gurindji, followed by a translation into English. Yunupingu also sings on the B side of the record.

== Health and death ==
In January 2010 he spent time in hospital after collapsing in a bank in Nhulunbuy. In late 2016, he had a kidney transplant.

Yunupingu died in the Northern Territory on 3 April 2023, at age 74, after a long illness. The Yothu Yindi Foundation described him as &quot;a giant of the nation&quot;.

He was survived by two of his four wives, 12 children, including daughter Binmila, and many grand- and great-grandchildren. A statement signed by Binmila announcing his death, along with a recording of Yunupingu leading traditional song, was posted on the Yothu Yindi Foundation website, saying that ceremonies would be conducted in North Eastern Arnhem Land in coming weeks. It requested that only the name Yunupingu be used to refer to him, and only the images provided should be used. The statement included the words:

==Recognition==

In 1978 Yunupingu was named Australian of the Year for his negotiations on the Ranger uranium mine agreement. He said the award &#x27;would help him to shake off the image of ratbag and radical&#x27; and would give him &quot;greater strength as an individual and as a leader&quot;. He also said it was a recognition for Aboriginal people as &quot;the indigenous people of this country who must share in its future&quot;.

In the Australia Day Honours in 1985, James Galarrwuy Yunupingu was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his services to the Aboriginal community. He was posthumously promoted to Companion (AC) in the 2025 Australia Day Honours. 

In 1998 Yunupingu was added to the list of 100 &quot;Australian Living National Treasures&quot; selected by the National Trust of Australia as leaders in society &quot;considered to have a great influence over our environment because of the standards and examples they set&quot;.

In 2015, at the Garma Festival, he was honoured by the University of Melbourne with an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). In a statement, Professor Margaret Sheil, Provost at the University of Melbourne, said the Honorary Doctor of Laws award to Yunupingu was to recognise and celebrate the significance of his work for Indigenous rights.

Yunupingu was one of three Indigenous Australians, along with Tom Calma and Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue, honoured by Australia Post in the 2017 Legends Commemorative Stamp &quot;Indigenous leaders&quot; series to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum.

<text>Matthew Cowley (August 2, 1897 – December 13, 1953) was an American missionary in New Zealand and then served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1945 until his death.

==Early life==
Cowley was the son of Matthias F. Cowley and Abbie Hyde. He was also the half-brother of FBI agent Samuel P. Cowley. He was born August 2, 1897, in Preston, Idaho. That same year, Cowley&#x27;s father was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. Matthew spent his childhood going to school and working on farms in the summer. He had a good sense of humor and enjoyed joking around. When Matthew was eight years old, his father resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

Cowley attended Latter-day Saints University in Salt Lake City. He was called as a missionary during his sophomore year in 1914.

==Missionary service and career==
In 1914, the 17-year-old Cowley became an LDS Church missionary. His original assignment was to serve in Hawaii, like his older brothers. However, his assignment was changed, and he went to New Zealand instead. There, he developed an unusual talent with the Māori language and a love of the Māori people. He revised the Māori translation of the Book of Mormon, which was then published in 1917. He also translated the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price into Māori, with the assistance of Wiremu Duncan and Stuart Meha. The translated version of these scriptural texts was published in 1919. His mission was extended to five years to complete these tasks. He returned from his mission to Salt Lake City in 1919; however, he continued to write letters to the Māori people throughout his life, and would later return to New Zealand.

After returning from his mission, Cowley attended the University of Utah for 2 years. After graduating he went to George Washington University Law School in Washington D.C. Cowley stayed in Washington, D.C., for 4 years, where he worked as an assistant to United States Senator Reed Smoot. He married Elva Eleanor Taylor in the Salt Lake Temple on July 13, 1922. After their wedding, they returned together to Washington, D.C. They had one daughter, Jewell.

While in Washington, D.C., Cowley was appointed Sunday School Superintendent in the local congregation, but was forced to resign due to his rigorous studies. Upon graduation, he returned to Salt Lake City, where he gained admission to the Utah State Bar Association in 1925. Afterwards, Cowley started his own law practice in Salt Lake City. He gave up his practice for a brief time from 1926 to 1928, when he served as Assistant County Attorney.

In 1938, Cowley was called to serve as president of the church&#x27;s New Zealand Mission. He directed the affairs of the missionaries in New Zealand and oversaw church proceedings in the area. The mission included around 60 missionaries and 9,000 church members at the time, and Cowley was able to visit with many of the people he had met on his first mission. As World War II began, the church called the missionaries serving overseas back home to the United States, but Cowley and his family remained in New Zealand throughout the war. He was affectionately called &quot;tumuaki,&quot; meaning president, by the Māori members of the church. During his service, he adopted a Māori baby boy, Duncan Nopera Meha Cowley (Toni). Cowley was known by both members and non-members alike for his dedication to the Māori people. He returned home in 1945.

==Apostle==
Cowley was released as mission president in September 1945. In the church&#x27;s general conference the following month, he was called to serve as an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, filling the vacancy caused by the death of church president Heber J. Grant. Cowley was ordained an apostle on October 11, 1945, by new church president George Albert Smith.

As an apostle, Cowley visited various church missions throughout the world, spoke in many conferences, and helped direct other church affairs. A few months later, in March 1946, he suffered a heart attack. Although he recovered enough to resume his church assignments, he was never as &quot;robust in health&quot; as before. In December 1946, Cowley was assigned as president of the church&#x27;s Pacific Missions, a newly created position in which he oversaw several missions, including the Hawaiian, Central Pacific, Samoan, Tongan, Tahitian, Australian and New Zealand missions.

Cowley was known for being compassionate. He encouraged members of the church to openly welcome sinners rather than ostracize them. Cowley was also known for being an eloquent speaker and writer. A number of his sermons were compiled into &quot;Matthew Cowley Speaks&quot;, which was published after his death.

==Death==

Cowley died unexpectedly in Los Angeles, California on December 13, 1953, while visiting to attend services for the newly built Los Angeles Temple. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. George Q. Morris was called to fill the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

<text>Henry Dinwoodey Moyle (April 22, 1889 – September 18, 1963) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

==Early life==
Moyle was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, to politician James Moyle and his wife Alice Dinwoodey. He studied at the University of Utah and served as an LDS Church missionary in Switzerland and in Germany. During World War I, Moyle served in the US military.

Moyle continued his studies at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School. He was also a student at the School of Mines in Freiberg, Saxony.

==Employment==
Moyle was for many years a lawyer and a part-time member of the University of Utah faculty. He was also a businessman involved in various railroad, trucking, oil, insurance and finance businesses. During World War II, he was the director of the Petroleum Board.

==LDS Church Service==
From 1927 to 1937, Moyle was the president of the LDS Church&#x27;s Cottonwood Stake, located in the south-east suburbs of Salt Lake City. He also served as chairman of the church&#x27;s Welfare Committee.

===Apostle and member of the First Presidency===
Moyle was ordained an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 10, 1947. Moyle served as Second Counselor in the First Presidency to church president David O. McKay from June 12, 1959, to October 12, 1961, when he was called as First Counselor. He was First Counselor in the First Presidency until his death.

Moyle was a successful cattleman and originated the idea of the church establishing a cattle ranch in Florida. He was convinced that Florida&#x27;s climate would prove ideal for raising cattle, as the key to success in that industry is growing grass. The church bought the original tract in 1950, and over 50 years, the ranch grew to more than . Deseret Cattle and Citrus Ranch, which is southeast of Orlando, is today the world&#x27;s largest beef ranch, and the land is worth an estimated $858 million.

Moyle spearheaded much of the church&#x27;s building program in the early 1960s. He believed that the Church Office Building, the headquarters of the LDS Church, should have been twice its size. He was also convinced that by building larger meetinghouses, the church would attract more converts. Moyle convinced McKay not to publish an account of church spending as was customary in order to hide the extent of the budget deficit caused by spending on buildings. By 1962, the deficit had reach $32 million. His optimistic building programs placed a considerable financial strain upon the church and McKay eventually relieved Moyle from many of his administrative responsibilities.

The controversial &quot;baseball baptism&quot; program was Moyle&#x27;s idea to increase baptisms in order to fill the church meetinghouses. Missionaries would encourage young men to join sports leagues and used baptism as a prerequisite. Under this approach, large numbers of young men were baptized but very few were ever active in the church. The rush to baptize was accompanied with the establishment of baptism quotas for missionaries and memorized missionary discussions which were to be delivered verbatim to potential converts. The rest of the apostles were largely opposed to these changes, which led to Moyle being relieved of his responsibilities in the missionary department.

Moyle died of heart disease in Deer Park, Florida, aged 74, and was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.
==Family==
In 1920, Moyle married Clara Alberta Wright in the Salt Lake Temple; they were the parents of six children. One of his sons, Henry D. Moyle, Jr., was the first president of the French East Mission (based in Geneva, Switzerland) starting in 1961.

<doc id="1072718" wikidata="Q5253536" url="?curid=1072718" title="Delbert L. Stapley">
<text>Delbert Leon Stapley (December 11, 1896 – August 19, 1978) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1950 to 1978.

==Early life==
Stapley was born in Mesa, Arizona Territory. He graduated from Mesa Union High School in 1914. As a youth, he rejected a chance at playing Major League Baseball so he could serve an LDS Church mission in the southern United States and because he didn&#x27;t want to play on Sunday, the day Latter-day Saints observe as the Sabbath. Stapley remained physically active throughout his life, his favorite sport being golf.

Stapley was a missionary in the LDS Church&#x27;s Southern States Mission from 1915 to 1917. After his mission, he was a U.S. marine in the First World War.

==LDS Church service==
Stapley had been stake president for three years before receiving a call to the apostleship on October 5, 1950. Stapley was also sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve on October 5, 1950, at the church&#x27;s October general conference, filling the vacancy caused by the death of George F. Richards. Stapley was notified of his new calling by church president George Albert Smith in the elevator bank of the Hotel Utah. Stapley organized the original Miami Stake in 1961. In 1969 he received the Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America.

===Views on civil rights===

A letter sent by Stapley illustrates his views on black people before they were more widely assimilated into the LDS Church. Dated January 23, 1964 and specifically stating he was not speaking for the church or in his position as an apostle, the letter urged Michigan Governor George W. Romney to back away from certain positions for civil rights, and he called the bill that became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 &quot;vicious legislation.&quot; Romney is reported to have accelerated his engagement for civil rights shortly after he received the letter.

==Death==
Stapley delivered his last conference address in October 1977. The following April conference he was too ill to attend. Stapley died on August 19, 1978, in Salt Lake City, Utah. He suffered cardiac arrest at about noon while walking near his home. He was buried in the Mesa, Arizona cemetery.

At the time of his death, Stapley was the third apostle in line to the presidency of the church. His vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve was filled by James E. Faust.

<doc id="1072721" wikidata="Q6506360" url="?curid=1072721" title="LeGrand Richards">
<text>LeGrand Richards (February 6, 1886 – January 11, 1983) was a prominent missionary and leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He served as the seventh presiding bishop of the LDS Church from 1938 to 1952, and was then called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles by church president David O. McKay. Richards served in the Quorum of the Twelve until his death in Salt Lake City, Utah, at the age of 96.

==Early life==
Richards was born in Farmington, Utah Territory, to George F. Richards and Alice Almira Robinson. His father also served in the Quorum of the Twelve. As a young boy, Richards had several accidents that could have taken his life, including as a small child, when he was struck in the head by an axe as he approached from behind while his father was chopping wood. A few years later, Richards was thrown from a wagon by an agitated horse and both the wagon wheels rolled over his head. As a child, Richards attended the 1893 dedication of the Salt Lake Temple. His church service began when he served a proselytizing mission to the Netherlands from 1905 to 1908.

After returning from his mission, Richards held various jobs in Salt Lake City, including doing audits in the office of the Presiding Bishopric. In 1909, he married Ina Jane Ashton (who normally went by Jane) in the Salt Lake Temple. They were the parents of eight children.

==Church service==
Richards returned to the Netherlands as the presiding elder over the mission, accompanied by his wife, Ina Jane Ashton, from 1914 to 1916. Richards was ordained a high priest and bishop on June 29, 1919, by Charles W. Penrose, and presided over a Salt Lake City ward from 1920 to 1925. In 1926, he filled a short-term mission, primarily serving in Rhode Island. In the early 1930s, church president Heber J. Grant sent Richards to southern California with the plan to call him as stake president. However, the existing stake president called Richards as a bishop and convinced Grant to hold off on calling Richards as the stake president so local members would not feel that an outsider was being imposed on them as a leader. From 1931 to 1933, Richards presided over the church&#x27;s Hollywood Stake.

In 1933 and 1934, Richards again lived in Salt Lake City, where he served on the stake high council of the Liberty Stake under stake president Bryant S. Hinckley. Richards served as president of the Southern States Mission from 1934 to 1937; he was called to this position to replace Charles A. Callis, who had been called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

Richards served as the church&#x27;s presiding bishop during and after the Second World War and began to adopt building programs to deal with the increased post-war growth in membership of the church.

==Writings==

Outside of his apostleship, Richards is probably best known for his widely distributed book, &quot;A Marvelous Work and a Wonder&quot;, which was first published in 1950. The commonly referenced work contains a comprehensive teaching outline designed to assist missionaries in their study and presentation of Mormonism. Based on a document titled, &quot;The Message of Mormonism&quot;, which Richards developed in 1937 for missionaries during his tenure as president of the Southern States Mission, the book contains explanations and interpretations of many doctrinal positions of the LDS Church.

In 1955, Richards published &quot;Israel! Do You Know?&quot;, an effort to demonstrate the links between Jewish traditions and beliefs and Mormonism; this document was produced in conjunction with an LDS Church program aimed at proselyting Jews living in Southern California.

==Israel==

Richards also played a role in Mormon connections with Israel. He was head of the Orson Hyde Foundation, which coordinated the donations that were used to purchase the land in Jerusalem that became the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden.

==Tributes==

In a memorial address read by his personal secretary after Richards died, church president Spencer W. Kimball paid tribute to Richards as one of the greatest missionaries of our time. He reminded me of a modern-day Apostle Paul. I can think of no one who has borne his testimony to the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ with deeper conviction or with greater fervor. With it all, LeGrand Richards was a perennial optimist and his words were a rare combination of wit and humor, comfort, encouragement, and wisdom. He rarely, if ever, delivered a message from a written text. He just spoke from his heart, drawing upon a lifetime of experience, study, and inspiration.

==Place in history==
Richards was the longest-lived LDS apostle until David B. Haight; both his father, George F. Richards, and grandfather, Franklin D. Richards, served as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Franklin D. Richards was also the nephew of Willard Richards, an earlier church apostle. LeGrand Richards is the grandfather of Tad R. Callister, a 21st-century leader in the LDS Church.

<text>Adam Samuel Bennion (December 2, 1886 – February 11, 1958) was a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Born in Taylorsville, Utah Territory, Bennion received degrees from the University of Utah, Columbia University, and the University of California. He also studied at the University of Chicago. He became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 9, 1953, filling a vacancy created by the death of John A. Widtsoe.

Bennion served less than five years in the Quorum of the Twelve before his death. He was replaced in the Quorum by Hugh B. Brown.

==Biography==
Adam S. Bennion was the son of Joseph B. Bennion and his wife, Mary Ann Sharp. Joseph died when Bennion was about two years old. After completing his early education in Taylorsville, Bennion went to study at the University of Utah. After his studies he became a teacher at LDS High School in Salt Lake City.

In 1911, Bennion married Minerva Richards Young, a daughter of Richard W. Young. The couple would eventually have three sons and two daughters. After their marriage, Bennion and his wife headed to New York City, where he completed a master&#x27;s degree at Columbia University.

Bennion returned to Salt Lake City and became an English teacher at Granite High School. In 1913, he became the principal of the school. In the summer of 1914, Bennion took a course in Sunday school administration at the University of Chicago. The following year, he was appointed a member of the General Board of the Deseret Sunday School Union. About the same time, he joined the faculty of the University of Utah in the department of English. In 1915, Bennion was appointed a member of the Church Board of Education of the LDS Church.

In 1919, Bennion became the Superintendent of LDS Church Schools. From 1921 to 1923, he studied at the University of California–Berkeley and completed a doctorate. He then returned to the LDS Church schools, where he worked until 1927 when he began work for the Utah Power and Light Company (UP&amp;L). During the 1920s, Bennion oversaw the expansion of the LDS Church&#x27;s seminary program and trained seminary teachers at Brigham Young University&#x27;s Alpine Summer School.

In 1944, Bennion resigned his employment with UP&amp;L and ran as a Republican Party candidate for the United States Senate. He lost the election to Democrat Elbert D. Thomas. Bennion returned to UP&amp;L; in 1947, he became the director of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad.

In 1953, LDS Church president David O. McKay called Bennion as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Bennion served in this capacity until his death.

Bennion died in Salt Lake City and was buried in Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<text>George Quayle Morris (February 20, 1874 – April 23, 1962) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1954 until his death.

Morris was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, to Elias Morris and Mary Lois Walker.

George Teasdale, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, ordained George Q. Morris a Seventy on September 13, 1899. Morris was called on a mission to Great Britain in 1899, and served there until 1902. He was set apart as a president in the Second Quorum of Seventy August 19, 1904. He served as president of the Eastern States Mission from 1948 to 1951.

Morris married Emma Ramsey (1878–1964) on June 29, 1905; they had three daughters: Marian, Margery, and Helen.

Morris was a businessman. He was president of Elias Morris and Sons, a company involved in tile and gravestone production. He was president of Purdential Savings and Loan Association. He was heavily involved with the Boy Scouts as well. 

From 1935 to 1937, Morris was the First Assistant to Albert E. Bowen, the Superintendent of the Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA). In 1937, when Bowen became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Morris succeeded him as YMMIA Superintendent. Morris held this position until 1948, when he was succeeded by Elbert R. Curtis.

Morris became a general authority of the LDS Church on October 6, 1951, when he was appointed an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

Morris was ordained an apostle and became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 8, 1954, aged 80. He was selected and ordained by church president David O. McKay. Morris replaced Matthew Cowley in the Quorum, who had died the previous December. Morris was the oldest person in church history to become an apostle and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve.

Morris died on April 23, 1962, aged 88, in Salt Lake City. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. His vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve was filled by N. Eldon Tanner.

<doc id="1072726" wikidata="Q5929925" url="?curid=1072726" title="Hugh B. Brown">
<text>Hugh Brown Brown (October 24, 1883 – December 2, 1975) was an American attorney, educator, author and leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was a member of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and First Presidency. Born in Utah, Brown held both American and Canadian citizenship.

Brown was a talented speaker, and was well known for conveying religious principles and exhortations through accounts of events in his life. His grandson, Edwin B. Firmage, noted: &quot;Possessed at once with a sense of humor that refused him permission to take himself too seriously, and a profound spirituality based on true humility before God, he moved thousands with a style of classic oratory that will be sorely missed.&quot;

==Early life==

Brown was born in Granger, Utah Territory, to Homer Manley Brown and Lydia Jane Brown. He later recorded the event of his birth: &quot;It is alleged that I was born in Granger, Utah, in 1883, on the 24th of October. I was there but do not remember the event. However, my mother was an honest woman and I must take her word.&quot; His father had a small farm and orchard. When Brown was fourteen, Homer Brown left Utah with his oldest son to establish a farm in Spring Coulee, in western Canada. Brown was the oldest son left in Salt Lake City, and he and his sister Lillie, 18 months his senior, took care of the farm and orchard until their father sent for the family.

Brown was 15 when his family moved to what is now southern Alberta, which was then part of the Northwest Territories. Shortly after his 18th birthday, he traveled to Logan, Utah, to attend Brigham Young College. Brown also attended Utah State Agricultural College. Dr. John A. Widtsoe suggested a career in agriculture for Brown. After a brief period at the college, Brown was called to England as a missionary for the LDS Church and served under Heber J. Grant from 1904 to 1906. Upon his return, Brown married Zina Young Card, a childhood friend, in 1908. They settled in Alberta, and the first six of the couple&#x27;s eight children were born there.

===Military service===
In 1912, Canadian leaders of the Church asked Brown to go to Calgary and take military training preliminary to organizing a Latter-day Saint contingent for the Canadian reserves. The reserve cavalry unit was established in 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, and became part of the Thirteenth Overseas Mounted Rifles in 1915. By 1917, Brown had achieved the rank of major(I believe he was a Colonel)in the Canadian military. He believed that he would have attained a higher rank without what Brown perceived as prejudice in the British Empire against the Church members. In one instance, he was told that he was denied further promotion; although the reason was not specified, Brown looked at the papers on the desk of the senior officer that stated, &quot;This man is a Mormon.&quot;

Brown suffered what he believed were other injustices from the military establishment, including being forced by a superior officer to sell a beloved horse. The imperial military significantly influenced Brown, as shown in accounts of his service in his later writing, but he ultimately turned away from a military career.

===Legal training===
After returning to Canada, Brown was employed as a cowboy, a farmer, and a businessman. He renewed an interest in the study of law, which he began at the Law Society of Alberta prior to his military service, by working with Z. W. Jacobs, a Cardston barrister. Brown completed the five-year apprenticeship while he was working a farm he had purchased near Cardston. After passing the bar examination at the University of Alberta, he was admitted to the bar in 1921.

===Health challenges===
Brown suffered from a rare nerve disorder called trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also called Tic Douloureux, which has been called one of the most painful ailments known to mankind. He had the condition attacks intermittently for about 20 years of his life, from 1926. At Christmastime in 1944, while he was overseas during World War II, he sent a three-page, typewritten, single-spaced essay to his family, &quot;An Unprofessional Analysis of &#x27;Tic Douloureux&#x27; by a Surviving Victim.&quot; The letter stated that he would &quot;be glad to say goodbye to it forever.&quot; Brown had surgery to sever his trigeminal nerve in 1945, but the attacks returned while he was teaching at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1946. He later underwent surgery again at the Mayo Clinic, where a section of his nerve was completely removed, which made the left side of his head completely numb for the rest of his life.

==LDS Church==
Brown was called as president of the newly-formed Lethbridge, Alberta, Stake in 1921, which included all of Alberta north of the Lethbridge Airport and the Northwest Territories (including present-day Nunavut).

Brown and his family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1927. He quickly became a successful lawyer and a partner in a law firm with J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Albert E. Bowen, and Preston D. Richards. He formed a lifelong allegiance with the US Democratic Party, which led to an unsuccessful run for political office and a term of service as first chairman of Utah&#x27;s Liquor Control Commission from 1935 to 1937. Brown was called as president of the Salt Lake Granite Stake.

Brown served as president of the British Mission from 1937 to 1940 and from 1944 to 1946. It was the first of many full-time church positions that brought him admiration and influence. As LDS Servicemen&#x27;s Coordinator from 1941 to 1945, Brown traveled extensively in North America and western Europe as de facto chief chaplain for the thousands of Latter-day Saints in American, British, and Commonwealth uniforms; anecdotes born of that experience punctuated his sermons and writings thereafter.

Brown worked as a professor of religion at BYU from 1946 to 1950 and also served as the school&#x27;s co-ordinator of veterans affairs. He then worked as a senior employee with an Alberta oil prospecting firm from 1949 to 1953. Of his time in Alberta, he later wrote:

In October 1953, I was up in the Canadian Rockies, supervising the drilling of an oil well. Although my family were in good health and good spirits and I was making good money, I was deeply depressed and worried. Early one morning I went up into the mountains and talked with the Lord in prayer. I told Him that although it looked like I was going to become wealthy as a result of my oil ventures, if in His wisdom it would not be good for me or my family I hoped He would put an end to it.

That prayer preceded his call as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1953. Brown remained in that full-time ecclesiastical position for five years until his call as a church apostle.

Brown was ordained an apostle and became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 10, 1958, replacing Adam S. Bennion, who had died the previous February. He was called to the First Presidency as a third counselor to church president David O. McKay on June 22, 1961. He was called as Second Counselor in the First Presidency on October 12, 1961, upon the death of First Counselor J. Reuben Clark. He was later called as First Counselor in 1963 to replace Henry D. Moyle, who had died.

As an apostle and a member of the First Presidency, Brown favored rescinding the LDS Church&#x27;s restriction on people of black African descent holding the priesthood. He expected that change to take place in 1969, but the move was reportedly blocked by apostle Harold B. Lee. The change ultimately occurred in 1978, three years after Brown&#x27;s death.

After McKay died on January 18, 1970, Brown was not retained as a counselor in the First Presidency by the new church president, Joseph Fielding Smith. Only once before in the 20th century had a new president of the church not called a surviving member of the previous First Presidency as a counselor (Rudger Clawson). Brown returned as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, where he remained until his death.

==Death==
Brown died in Salt Lake City and was buried in Salt Lake City Cemetery. After Brown&#x27;s death, David B. Haight was called to fill the vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve.

==Family==
Among Hugh B. Brown and Zina Card Brown&#x27;s children was Hugh Card Brown. This son was killed while serving in the military during World War II. Their daughter Zola was Rulon Jeffs&#x27; first wife; after he wanted to start practicing plural marriage, Zola divorced him.

==Quotations==
*&quot;A sense of relationship and copartnership with God involves the concept of universal brotherhood and that will help to develop intelligent tolerance, open-mindedness, and good-natured optimism. Life is really a battle between fear and faith, pessimism and optimism. Fear and pessimism paralyze men with skepticism and futility. One must have a sense of humor to be an optimist in times like these. And you young women will need a sense of humor if you marry these young men and try to live with them. Golden Kimball once said in a conference, &#x27;The Lord Himself must like a joke or he wouldn&#x27;t have made some of you people.&#x27; But your good humor must be real, not simulated. Let your smiles come from the heart and they will become contagious. You may see men on the street any day whose laugh is only a frozen grin with nothing in it but teeth. Men without humor tend to forget their source, lose sight of their goal, and with no lubrication in their mental crankshafts, they must drop out of the race. Lincoln said, &#x27;Good humor is the oxygen of the soul.&#x27; And someone paraphrased, &#x27;The surly bird catches the germ.&#x27;&quot;
*&quot;&quot;We are grateful in the Church and in this great university that the freedom, dignity and integrity of the individual is basic in Church doctrine as well as in democracy. Here we are free to think and express our opinions. Fear will not stifle thought, as is the case in some areas which have not yet emerged from the Dark Ages. God himself refuses to trammel man&#x27;s free agency even though its exercise sometimes teaches painful lessons. Both creative science and revealed religion find their fullest and truest expression in the climate of freedom.&lt;br&gt;&quot;I hope that you will develop the questing spirit. Be unafraid of new ideas for they are the stepping stones of progress. You will of course respect the opinions of others but be unafraid to dissent—if you are informed.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Now I have mentioned freedom to express your thoughts, but I caution you that your thoughts and expressions must meet competition in the market place of thought, and in that competition truth will emerge triumphant. Only error needs to fear freedom of expression. Seek truth in all fields, and in that search you will need at least three virtues; courage, zest, and modesty. The ancients put that thought in the form of a prayer. They said, &#x27;From the cowardice that shrinks from new truth, from the laziness that is content with half truth, from the arrogance that thinks it has all truth—O God of truth deliver us&#x27;.&quot;&quot; 

==Published works==
Brown was the author of at least six books, and two compilations were published of his writings.

<text>John Voorhis &quot;Tim&quot; Bogert III (August 27, 1944 – January 14, 2021) was an American musician. As a bass guitarist and vocalist he was best known for his powerful vocal ability and his fast runs, fluid agility and ground-breaking sound on his Fender Precision Bass. He was one of the pioneers of using distortion with his bass to help it cut through the mix with the low-powered amps of his time which also imparted a very sharp-edged sound to it. He was a frequent collaborator with drummer Carmine Appice; the duo performed in such bands as Vanilla Fudge, Cactus and the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice.

== Early life ==
He graduated in 1963 from Ridgefield Memorial High School in his hometown of Ridgefield, New Jersey.

== Career ==

Vanilla Fudge was formed by Tim Bogert along with Mark Stein, Vince Martell, and Carmine Appice. They recorded five albums during the years 1967–69, before disbanding in 1970. The band has reunited in various configurations over the years.

In 1970, Bogert formed the hard rock band Cactus with drummer Carmine Appice, guitarist Jim McCarty and lead vocalist Rusty Day. He then played with guitarist Jeff Beck, after the second Jeff Beck Group had disbanded in 1972 and eventually became a member of the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice, late in 1972. As a member of the post-second Jeff Beck Group, also known as &quot;Jeff Beck Group&quot;, he toured Europe, Japan and the U.S. from January 1972 until January 1974. In late 1975, he played bass guitar on Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;The 20th Anniversary of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; all-star album.

Bogert then joined up with Bobby and the Midnites, a musical side project assembled by guitarist and vocalist Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead. Despite touring with the group, Bogert left before their eponymous album was released and was replaced by Alphonso Johnson. He then joined UK group Boxer and played on their final album &quot;Absolutely&quot; in 1977 – he had co-writing credits on three tracks on this album. The album and subsequent tour met with an indifferent response and the band had folded by 1978. During 1981 Bogert toured with guitarist Rick Derringer and released an album &quot;Progressions&quot;. He recorded his second album &quot;Master&#x27;s Brew&quot; in 1983 and recorded &quot;Mystery&quot; with Vanilla Fudge in 1984. In 1981 Bogert became a faculty member at the Musicians Institute in Hollywood. In 1993 he worked with Japanese guitarist Pata, recording the latter&#x27;s self-titled album.

In early 1999, The Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame recognised Tim Bogert&#x27;s contribution to rock history. That year, he teamed up with Appice and Char to tour Japan in a unit called CB&amp;A, with a live album released the following year. Later in 1999 Bogert worked with &quot;Triality&quot;, and &quot;Shelter Me&quot;. In 2000 Bogert and Carmine Appice formed the power trio &quot;DBA&quot; with Rick Derringer and toured with Vanilla Fudge.

During 2009, Bogert joined blues rock trio &quot;Blues Mobile Band&quot; and recorded &quot;Blues Without Borders&quot; (2009) in Los Angeles.

In 2010, Bogert, with Mike Onesko on guitar and vocals and Emery Ceo on drums (both from the Blindside Blues Band) recorded &quot;Big Electric Cream Jam&quot;, a 10-track live tribute to Cream Live at The Beachland Ballroom Euclid Ohio.

Tim Bogert was also a part of the then Los Angeles–based The McGrath Project, featuring Gary McGrath (Grammy Award–winning producer) Chet McCracken (Doobie Brothers and America) Dean Minnerly (Three Dog Night and Aretha Franklin touring member) and Ann-Marita. They did three records, self-titled, “Love is a Four-Letter Word” and “Phoenix” released under 4818 Records.

In early 2014, Bogert joined hard rock band Hollywood Monsters, where he played on the album &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (on three tracks) which was released in 2014 on Mausoleum Records. The album features Steph Honde on vocals and guitars, Vinny Appice (Carmine&#x27;s brother) on drums, Don Airey on keyboards (on one track) and Paul Di&#x27;Anno on lead vocals on the bonus track.

== Personal life and Death ==
In 2010, Bogert &quot;reluctantly&quot; retired from touring due to a motorcycle accident. He died on January 13, 2021, from cancer. He is survived by his wife, Veda Vaughn Bogert, and his son John Voorhis Bogert IV.

<text>Vince Martell (born Vincent James Martellucci, November 11, 1945) is an American guitarist best known as the lead guitarist for Vanilla Fudge. Martell was born in the Bronx to parents who played the guitar and encouraged him to play as well. While in his teens, Martell joined the Navy, where he discovered his skills as a guitarist.

== Career ==
In 1963, Martell moved with his family to Florida and soon joined a band called Ricky T &amp; The Satans Three that played in Miami blues clubs and shrimp bars in Key West. In 1966, he formed the band The Pigeons with organist Mark Stein, bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Joe Brennan. After Brennan was replaced by Carmine Appice and a record deal forced the band to change its name, the band became Vanilla Fudge.

After the breakup of Vanilla Fudge in 1970, Martell continued to perform until Vanilla Fudge reunited for another album in 1984 called &quot;Mystery&quot;. In 2000, he released his first solo CD, &quot;Endless High&quot;, followed in 2001 by a self-titled CD, &quot;Vince Martell&quot;. In 2002, he recorded a third solo CD as a tribute to Jimi Hendrix, whom Martell had befriended when Vanilla Fudge and Hendrix toured together.

In 2005, Vanilla Fudge reformed with all the original members including Martell, Mark Stein, Tim Bogert and Carmine Appice, for a tour with The Doors and Steppenwolf. In July 2006, Vanilla Fudge recorded a tribute to Led Zeppelin, Out Through the in Door. As of 2023, Martell continues to tour with Vanilla Fudge, and his own band, the Vince Martell Band with Peg Pearl (keyboards/vocals), Pete Bremy (Bass/vocals), Russ T. Blades (drums) and TigerBill Meligari (drums).

Vince along with fellow original members Bogert, Stein and Appice opened for Deep Purple (at the band&#x27;s request) on August 7, 2007 at Radio City Music Hall, continuing to tour in this lineup in early 2008.

Vince and Mark Stein appeared on The &quot;My Music&quot; series on PBS in March/April 2008. They are seen performing &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; with backing musicians from Mark Stein&#x27;s solo band. Vince and Mark Stein soon thereafter began performing around the country together as &quot;Vanilla Fudge&#x27;s Mark Stein and Vince Martell&quot; with a new rhythm section featuring JimmyJack Tamburo from Mark Stein&#x27;s band on drums, and Pete Bremy from Vince&#x27;s band on bass. This lineup toured throughout the summer of 2009.

In April 2008 Vince Martell signed with Collectables Records as a solo artist. His &quot;Endless High&quot; album, which originally appeared in 2000 was re-released on Spectra Records.

Stewart was initially a &quot;long-time&quot; member of the National Party and acted as secretary for the Feilding branch 1987–90. She joined New Zealand First in 1996. Prior to and during her political career, she lived in Cambridge.

==Member of Parliament==
===First period, 2002–2008===



Stewart contested the North Shore electorate for New Zealand First in the 2002 election and was ranked sixth on the party list—the highest rank of any candidate who was not already an MP and also the highest ranked woman. Although she lost North Shore, she was elected to Parliament as a list MP. She began her first term as New Zealand First&#x27;s representative on the Social Services committee but eventually moved to the Health committee. She was also the party spokesperson for consumer affairs, family affairs (encompassing the women&#x27;s affairs, senior citizens, and disability issues portfolios), health, social services, and tourism. 

In her September 2002 maiden statement to the house, she set out her intention to be an advocate for children. She described an &quot;absence of parenting skills&quot; in society and set out her concerns relating to child health, including childhood obesity and poor dental health. She also spoke out against violence on television and in video games.

Stewart was re-elected on the New Zealand First party list in the 2005 general election, having lost in Piako. After the election, New Zealand First supported the continuation of the Labour government.

In 2006, Stewart&#x27;s private member&#x27;s bill, the Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill, was introduced to Parliament. The bill followed the 1999 New Zealand MP reduction referendum, in which 81.46% of participating electors voted to reduce the number of MPs to 99. The referendum was non-binding and the referendum outcome had not been implemented by the government. At the time, New Zealand&#x27;s mixed-member proportional voting system provided for 69 electorate MPs and at least 51 list MPs for a total of at least 120 MPs (subject to any overhang). Stewart&#x27;s bill proposed no changes to the number of electorate MPs and proposed to cut the number of list MPs by 20 for a total of 100 MPs. At its first reading on 16 March 2006, the Bill passed 61 votes to 60 despite the governing Labour Party&#x27;s opposition, but it was defeated at its second reading on 8 November 2006 when the National Party withdrew its support.

In the 2008 general election, Stewart unsuccessfully contested the new Waikato electorate. She was promoted to fifth on the New Zealand First list, but the party lost all its parliamentary seats, winning no electorates and polling below the 5% threshold.

=== Second period, 2011–2017 ===
At the 2011 election Stewart was re-elected to Parliament following a resurgence in the New Zealand First vote, where she had been ranked fifth on the party list. Stewart had stood again in the Waikato seat but was unsuccessful in defeating Lindsay Tisch, the incumbent National Party of New Zealand MP. Stewart was elected whip by the new NZ First caucus following the 2011 election and remained in this role following her re-election in 2014.

In her second period in Parliament, Stewart was New Zealand First&#x27;s spokesperson on ACC, disability issues, family issues, health, labour and industrial relations, and tourism, and associate spokesperson for senior citizens. She also rejoined the Health select committee. She criticised the National government&#x27;s record on suicide prevention and immigration, saying that Asian immigrants to New Zealand &quot;struggl[e] with the concept of a house.&quot;

In 2013, Stewart voted against the Marriage Amendment Bill, which aims to permit same sex marriage in New Zealand, with all of her fellow New Zealand First MPs. 

Stewart was successful in having two health-related private member&#x27;s bills selected for introduction during her second period in Parliament, though neither passed. The SuperGold Health Check Bill, was selected for introduction in November 2013. The bill proposed that over 65s who receive New Zealand superannuation would be eligible for three free doctors&#x27; visits per year. The Bill was transferred into the name of New Zealand First leader Winston Peters before its first reading, where it was defeated 60 votes to 61. 

The Affordable Healthcare Bill was drawn in August 2015 and was also transferred to Peters. It failed its first reading 46 votes to 75 that December. The bill proposed amendments to the Immigration Act 2009, the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Social Security Act 1964 that would require immigrant parents to have and maintain health insurance, remove fringe benefits tax from health insurance and give a rebate on health insurance to pensioners. The policies related to mandatory health insurance for immigrants were controversial. A similar policy proposal had been criticised by Stewart&#x27;s New Zealand First colleagues Denis O&#x27;Rourke and Mahesh Bindra, who questioned its consistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Later, Attorney-General, Chris Finlayson, issued a legal opinion stating that the bill&#x27;s provisions related to mandatory health insurance for immigrants would unjustifiably limit the right to freedom from discrimination in the Bill of Rights.

Stewart announced that, following the death of her husband on 31 January 2017, she would not stand for re-election in the 2017 general election. In her valedictory statement on 8 August 2017, she stated that she considered her greatest achievement to be working with Labour&#x27;s health minister Pete Hodgson on providing free doctors&#x27; visits for children under six. Hodgson announced that policy in August 2007, thanking New Zealand First MPs for their support. 

== Later life and death ==
Stewart indicated that she would contribute to the voluntary sector during her retirement. She was appointed a Trust Waikato trustee. Stewart died on 2 June 2024, at the age of 72.

<text>Salter Path is an unincorporated community in Carteret County, North Carolina, United States. A Crystal Coast community, it lies on Bogue Banks as an enclave within Indian Beach.

==History==

The decline in the whaling industry in the mid-to-late 19th century and good fishing on Bogue Banks caused many settlers, mostly near Cape Lookout (Diamond City), to move toward the middle and western reaches of Bogue Banks. Many of the families who moved to Salter Path in the late 19th century and early 20th century established their residences without deeds before Bostonian John A. Royall purchased Salter Path. The area of Salter Path subsequently became known as a squatter&#x27;s community.

Salter Path was passed from John A. Royall to Alice Green Hoffman, a distant relative of Theodore Roosevelt and daughter of Albert W. Green of Green-Joyce Company. Alice Hoffman developed an estate in present-day Pine Knoll Shores and sued the residents of Salter Path in 1923 because their cows were wandering onto her estate.

A subsequent court decision permitted the residents of Salter Path to remain, but the cows were not allowed to graze on the Hoffman Estate. The village was restricted to that the squatters occupied, and direct ownership of the beachfront was granted to the village to use collectively. This ruling further stated that only current residents and descendants could occupy the property, but it did not give any individuals title to the land. This ruling remained intact until 1979 when a legal settlement permitted Salter Path residents to hold a title to their property and for Carteret County to levy taxes on the former squatter&#x27;s village.

Recent studies, provided by the Duke Institute of Marine Sciences (located in Beaufort, NC) have shown that Salter Path was a frequent refuge for the notorious pirate, Blackbeard.

==Toponymy==
The community of Salter Path is believed to be named after Owen Salter or possibly Riley Salter, although Riley Salter&#x27;s true whereabouts during the 1880s have been questioned by historians and native Bogue Bankers. Schools of mullet fish that ran close to the ocean shorelines were the prime catch for many of the natives. These fishermen would quickly mobilize from the sound to the ocean, wearing a path in front of a Salter household, hence the name Salter Path.

Alternatively, in the 1800s the word &quot;salter&quot;, in common usage, meant a &quot;one-way&quot; deer gate, used for centuries to control deer populations. Inserted in a fence completely spanning a narrow point in the island, it would tend to sequester deer to one end, away from farms and crops. The narrowest point on the island is, in fact, the village of Salter Path. There is the possibility it is named for the path that would inevitably lead to the salter, the only passage through the fence. Historian and toponymist Mary C. Higham provides evidence that such places as Salter Street, London, Saltley, Salterford, and even Salt Hill, UK derive their names from these salters, rather than salt or the surname Salter.

<text>Doug Woolerton (born 17 May 1944) is a New Zealand politician who has been a member of the New Zealand First party since it was founded, and the National Party for a few years before that.

==Early years==
He was educated at Hamilton Boys&#x27; High School, and has a background in agriculture, having been a farmer for twenty-one years and director of a milk company for nine.

==Political career==
Woolerton was originally a member of the National Party. He stood for selection as the National candidate for the seat of Hamilton West in 1990, but lost to Grant Thomas, who was later elected to the seat. Woolerton left the National Party in 1992 to form the New Zealand First party with Winston Peters.

===Member of parliament===


Woolerton first entered Parliament in the 1996 election, becoming a list MP after being ranked fifth on the New Zealand First party list. He remained an MP until his party lost all parliamentary seats in the 2008 general election.

He was the president of New Zealand First from the party&#x27;s inception until 2005 when he resigned in protest against Winston Peters taking a visible role in the Labour-led government as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Later there were frictions between then New Zealand First president Dail Jones on the one hand, and Woolerton and Brian Donnelly on the other, over the latter&#x27;s support for Sue Bradford&#x27;s private members bill to outlaw parental corporal punishment of children (or smacking).

<doc id="1072746" wikidata="Q1282152" url="?curid=1072746" title="Ecosphere (aquarium)">
<text>The EcoSphere and &quot;Original Ecosphere&quot; are trademark names for sealed blown-glass miniature aquaria formerly produced by Ecosphere Associates, Inc., of Tucson, Arizona, United States. Spherical or ovoid, the aquaria range from roughly pool-ball-size to basket-ball-size. They are sold worldwide as scientific novelties and decorative objects.

The EcoSphere&#x27;s main visual appeal is provided by tiny red-pink shrimp, &quot;Halocaridina rubra&quot;, between 1/4 and 3/8 inch (or approximately a centimeter) in length. The shrimp swim energetically around the aquarium, eat the brown bacterial and algal scum on the glass, consume the filamentous green algae which sometimes forms a globular pillow in the water, and perch on a fragment of soft coral.

The main conceptual interest of these objects lies in the fact that they are materially closed ecological systems which are self-sustaining over a period of years. At room temperature, and with only low inputs of light, the algae produce oxygen which supports the shrimp and bacteria. Bacteria break down the shrimps&#x27; wastes. The breakdown products provide nutrients to the algae and bacteria upon which the shrimp feed. The manufacturer states that shrimp live in the EcoSphere for an average of 2 to 3 years, and are known to live over 12 years.

A magnetic scrubber is enclosed in each EcoSphere. By passing another magnet over the outside of the glass, the owner can manipulate the scrubber to clean the inside of the EcoSphere.

==History==
Research on closed ecosystems was initiated by Vladimir Vernadsky&#x27;s 1926 book &quot;The Biosphere&quot; and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in the 1950s and 1960s in Russia, culminating in the manned closed BIOS-3 facility, a 315 cubic meter habitat located at the Institute of Biophysics, Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. Frieda Taub reviewed work from 1953 to 1974. Another pioneer was Clair Folsom of the University of Washington in the 1960s. On July 15, 1982, Joe Hanson of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, held a workshop on &quot;Closed Ecosystems&quot;. In 1983 Loren Acker, President of Engineering and Research Associates, Inc. obtained a NASA Spin-Off Technology license for the EcoSphere and with Daniel Harmony, in 1984 put the EcoSphere into full production.

Ecosphere Associates went out of business in early 2022.

==Biota==

The manufacturer does not reveal the species of any of the components of the Ecosphere. However, Hawaiian aquarists readily recognize the shrimp as &quot;Halocaridina rubra&quot; or a very similar species. &quot;H. rubra&quot; is native to Hawaii, where it and other tiny shrimp occupy anchialine pools. These are puddles or ponds located near shores and surrounded with lava rock. The pores and chambers of the lava allow seawater to seep into the pools, where it mixes with freshwater from springs or rain. Anchialine shrimp are noted for their great adaptability: they survive in pools of undiluted seawater and in brackish ponds; they tolerate water temperatures over 85 degrees Fahrenheit (near 30 degrees C) when the tropical sun heats up the shallowest anchialine pools, and they also thrive in cool water.

Prior to 2003, the EcoSpheres contained at least one snail at the time of purchase. However, the system is self-sustaining without the snails. (The main function of the snails was aesthetic, as they cleaned scum from the glass.) The &quot;Gorgonia&quot; coral in EcoSpheres is dead and plays no active biological role in the system, however it does increase the surface area for beneficial bacteria and algae, and the calcium carbonate in the coral acts as a pH buffering agent.

==Concerns==
A major concern is that the shrimp’s sole habitat is shrinking, with over 90% of Hawaii’s anchialine pools having disappeared due to development, and this species of shrimp is disappearing along with them.

==Comparable objects and systems==

Commercially packaged aquarium kits, including algae, anchialine be left open or closed, are available in Hawaii. The customer can combine these to create an aquarium comparable to the EcoSphere.

Theartofscience.eu do still produce the ecospheres, with various types like black sand, seashells, gorgonia, mediterranean and so on.

It is possible to purchase &quot;Halocaridina&quot; shrimp from Hawaiian aquarium dealers and create home-made sealed aquaria with no other special supplies. Sand, gravel, crushed shell, and very well cycled filtered water from a successful saltwater aquarium, with the lowest attainable ammonia content, should be used. A small inoculation of live &quot;Spirulina&quot; algae may be introduced. Certain ubiquitous algae and bacteria are likely to be carried by the shrimp themselves and will soon colonize the walls of the container. There is a risk that pathogens also may be introduced.

The Ecosphere can degrade with time. It is &quot;self-sustaining&quot; in comparison to systems which degrade much more quickly.

The advantage of an aquarium closed with a lid (rather than a permanently sealed plug, which is found in the base of an EcoSphere) is that if the system goes out of equilibrium, the owner can remedy conditions and prevent a complete die-off. Intervention to maintain good water quality allows a larger number of shrimp to live in the open system than can survive in the relatively poor quality closed environment.

Freshwater closed systems are often attempted by nature hobbyists and as experimental projects or demonstrations for biology classes. These require nothing more than a large glass jar with an airtight lid, a few cups of lake or river water, and mud or other substrate from the same body of water. Kept indoors at room temperatures, with exposure to sunlight from a window, such systems have been found to contain living organisms even after several decades. The original level of diversity always falls drastically, sometimes exhibiting interesting patterns of population flux and extinction. Multicellular organisms fare poorly. Eventually an equilibrium of micro-organisms is established.

&quot;Make&quot; magazine Volume 10 contained instructions for creating a self-contained fresh-water &quot;biosphere&quot;, which contained a freshwater amano shrimp, snails, amphipods, ostracods, copepods, rigid hornwort, duckweed, pond scum (for microorganisms), and small rocks or shells (as a pH buffer).

In their paper &quot;The Emergence of Materially-closed-system Ecology&quot;, Joe Hanson and Clair Folsome discussed the creation of Ecosphere-like closed ecosystems. They talked about how they were going to make vibrating eggs but they took a different route.In the paper Hanson stated that the composition of the closed ecosystems he created was 50% distilled water brought to a salinity of 11 parts per thousand by the addition of &quot;Instant Ocean&quot;, 50% air, algae collected from the ponds of &quot;Halocaridina rubra&quot; shrimp (and their associated microbial populations), and 3 to 16 &quot;Halocaridina rubra&quot; shrimp (and their associated microbial populations). No container size was given. However, in similar, 2,000 ml setups the authors noted that while the survival rate of shrimp varies it averages 4 shrimp per 2,000 ml of container when not carbon, sulfur, or phosphorus limited or 1 to 8 shrimp per 1,000 ml when limited. They also noted that the shrimp population in all ecosystems declined from the starting number to a steady state within 60 days. 

==In the media==
The ecosphere was reviewed by Carl Sagan in a 1986 &quot;Parade&quot; magazine article entitled &quot;The World That Came in the Mail&quot;. The article is reprinted as a chapter in Sagan&#x27;s last book, &quot;Billions and Billions.&quot;

<text>Phillip Everly (January 19, 1939 – January 3, 2014) was an American musician, who was one half of the duo The Everly Brothers alongside his older brother Don.

==Early life==
Phil was born in Chicago in 1939 to Isaac Milford &quot;Ike&quot; Everly, Jr. (1908–1975), a guitar player, and Margaret Embry Everly (1919–2021). He was of German, English and Cherokee descent.

The Everly family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1953, where the brothers attended West High School. In 1955, the family moved to Madison, Tennessee, while the brothers moved to Nashville. Don had graduated from high school in 1955, and Phil attended Peabody Demonstration School, from which he graduated in 1957.

==Career==
===The Everly Brothers===

The Everly Brothers Career started in 1951. They signed to Cadence Records In 1957. Their first hit was &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;, which had been rejected by 30 other acts. 

&quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; went to no. 2 on the pop chart, behind Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear&quot;, and No. 1 on the country and No. 5 on the R&amp;B charts. The song, by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, became the Everly Brothers&#x27; first million-seller.
 The Everly Brothers are remembered for other major charting hits such as &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; and &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;.

After the duo split following conflicts between the two brothers, Phil and Don pursued solo careers from 1973 to 1983. The brothers reunited at the Royal Albert Hall in London on September 23, 1983, which ended their ten-year-long hiatus. The event was initiated by Phil and Don alongside Terry Slater, with Pete Wingfield as musical director. This concert was recorded for a live LP and video broadcast on cable television in mid-January 1984. The brothers returned to the studio as a duo for the first time in over a decade, recording the album &quot;EB &#x27;84&quot;, produced by Dave Edmunds.

The Everly Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. They were the first duo and non-solo act to have been inducted. That same year, they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Their final charting single was 1986&#x27;s &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. A 1981 live BBC recording of &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;, which featured Cliff Richard and Phil sharing vocals, was a UK Top 20 hit in 1994.

Paul McCartney has stated that the Everly Brothers were a major influence on the Beatles:

===Solo work===
Phil sang backup for Roy Wood&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Mustard&quot; and two songs for Warren Zevon&#x27;s 1976 self-titled album.

While Zevon was part of Phil Everly&#x27;s back-up band, Phil also suggested the title and subject matter for Zevon&#x27;s breakthrough hit single &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;.

Phil recorded more frequently, but with no chart success until the 1980s. He wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Say You Don&#x27;t Love Me No More&quot;, for the 1978 Clint Eastwood comedy film, &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;, in which he performed it as a duet with the film&#x27;s co-star Sondra Locke. Phil also wrote &quot;One Too Many Women In Your Life&quot; for the 1980 sequel, &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;, and played in the band which backed Locke.

In 1983, Phil had UK success as a solo artist with the album &quot;Phil Everly&quot;, recorded mainly in London. Musicians on the LP included Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler, Rockpile and Dire Straits drummer Terry Williams, and keyboard player Pete Wingfield. The track &quot;She Means Nothing to Me&quot;, written and composed by John David Williams and featuring Cliff Richard as co-lead vocalist, was a UK Top 10 hit, and &quot;Louise&quot;, written and composed by Ian Gomm, reached the Top 50 in 1983.

In 1990, Phil recorded a duet with the Dutch singer René Shuman. &quot;On Top of the World&quot; was written and composed by Phil, who appeared in the music video they recorded in Los Angeles. The selection appeared on Shuman&#x27;s album, &quot;Set the Clock on Rock&quot;.

Everly stopped performing in 2007.

==Personal life==
Everly was married three times: first to Jacqueline Alice Ertel from 1963 to 1970, then Patricia Mickey from 1972 to 1978, and finally Patrice Arnold from 1999 until his death. He had two children, sons Jason and Chris.

==Death==
Phil Everly died in Burbank, California on January 3, 2014, aged 74, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His brother Don died in August 2021, and the Everly family matriarch, Margaret Embry Everly, died four months later in December aged 102.

Phil&#x27;s widow Patti blamed her husband&#x27;s death on his smoking habit, which caused him to develop COPD, and recounted Phil&#x27;s spending his final years having to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went and taking 20 different types of medications per day.

Paul McCartney posted about Everly&#x27;s death on social media, stating:

Magne Furuholmen, keyboardist of a-ha talked about a-ha&#x27;s connection to the Everly Brothers and why they released a cover of Crying in the Rain in 1990, in a 2010 interview:

Upon Phil Everly&#x27;s passing, a-ha stated on their official website that:

<text>Isaac Donald Everly (February 1, 1937 – August 21, 2021) was an American musician. Everly was one-half of the singing duo The Everly Brothers alongside his younger brother Phil.

==Early life==
Don was born in Brownie, Kentucky on February 1, 1937 to Isaac Milford &quot;Ike&quot; Everly, Jr. (1908–1975), a guitar player, and Margaret Embry Everly (1919–2021). He was of German, English and Cherokee descent.

The Everly family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1953, where the brothers attended West High School. In 1955, the family moved to Madison, Tennessee, while the brothers moved to Nashville. Don graduated from high school in 1955.

Paul McCartney has stated that the Everly Brothers were a major influence on the Beatles:

===Solo work===

Don found some success on the US country charts in the mid- to late-1970s, in Nashville with his band, Dead Cowboys, and playing with Albert Lee.

Don also performed solo at an annual country music festival in London in mid-1976. His appearance was well received, and he was given &quot;thunderous applause&quot;, even though critics noted that the performance was uneven. Don recorded &quot;Everytime You Leave&quot; with Emmylou Harris on her 1979 album Blue Kentucky Girl.

Everly attended the Annual Music Masters as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid homage to the Everly Brothers on October 25, 2014. Don took the State Theater stage and performed the Everlys&#x27; classic hit &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;.

Don stopped performing in 2018. His final performance was a guest appearance with Paul Simon on Simon&#x27;s 2018 farewell tour in Nashville. Don and Simon performed “Bye Bye Love”, with Simon on Phil Everly&#x27;s original tenor harmony.

==Personal life==
Like his brother Phil, Don was married three times: first to Mary Sue Ingraham from 1957 to 1961, then Venetia Stevenson from 1962 to 1970, and finally Adela Garza from 1997, until his death. Don had five children, including son Edan, who is also a musician and Erin, a model and ex-wife of Axl Rose.

Don publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential election in January of that year. This marked the first time he had ever publicly supported a political candidate. Don stated that after his brother Phil&#x27;s death, he felt free to express his views more openly, noting that the brothers&#x27; opposing views had made it impossible for them to lend active support to political candidates.

==Death==
Don Everly died in Nashville on August 21, 2021, aged 84, from undisclosed causes. His brother Phil had died in 2014. The Everly family matriarch, Margaret Embry Everly, died four months later in December, aged 102.

<text>In astronomy and astrobiology, the habitable zone (HZ), or more precisely the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ), is the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface can support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure. The bounds of the HZ are based on Earth&#x27;s position in the Solar System and the amount of radiant energy it receives from the Sun. Due to the importance of liquid water to Earth&#x27;s biosphere, the nature of the HZ and the objects within it may be instrumental in determining the scope and distribution of planets capable of supporting Earth-like extraterrestrial life and intelligence.

The habitable zone is also called the Goldilocks zone, a metaphor, allusion and antonomasia of the children&#x27;s fairy tale of &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, in which a little girl chooses from sets of three items, rejecting the ones that are too extreme (large or small, hot or cold, etc.), and settling on the one in the middle, which is &quot;just right&quot;.

Since the concept was first presented in 1953, many stars have been confirmed to possess an HZ planet, including some systems that consist of multiple HZ planets. Most such planets, being either super-Earths or gas giants, are more massive than Earth, because massive planets are easier to detect. On November 4, 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space telescope data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs in the Milky Way. About 11 billion of these may be orbiting Sun-like stars. Proxima Centauri b, located about 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Centaurus, is the nearest known exoplanet, and is orbiting in the habitable zone of its star. The HZ is also of particular interest to the emerging field of habitability of natural satellites because planetary mass moons in the HZ might outnumber planets.

In subsequent decades, the HZ concept began to be challenged as a primary criterion for life, so the concept is still evolving. Since the discovery of evidence for extraterrestrial liquid water, substantial quantities of it are now thought to occur outside the circumstellar habitable zone. The concept of deep biospheres, like Earth&#x27;s, that exist independently of stellar energy, are now generally accepted in astrobiology given the large amount of liquid water known to exist in lithospheres and asthenospheres of the Solar System. Sustained by other energy sources, such as tidal heating or radioactive decay or pressurized by non-atmospheric means, liquid water may be found even on rogue planets, or their moons. Liquid water can also exist at a wider range of temperatures and pressures as a solution, for example with sodium chlorides in seawater on Earth, chlorides and sulphates on equatorial Mars, or ammoniates, due to its different colligative properties. In addition, other circumstellar zones, where non-water solvents favorable to hypothetical life based on alternative biochemistries could exist in liquid form at the surface, have been proposed.

==History==
An estimate of the range of distances from the Sun allowing the existence of liquid water appears in Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; (Book III, Section 1, corol. 4). The philosopher Louis Claude de Saint-Martin speculated in his 1802 work &quot;Man: His True Nature and Ministry&quot;, &quot;... we may presume, that, being susceptible of vegetation, it [the Earth] has been placed, in the series of planets, in the rank which was necessary, and at exactly the right distance from the sun, to accomplish its secondary object of vegetation; and from this we might infer that the other planets are either too near or too remote from the sun, to vegetate.&quot;

The concept of a circumstellar habitable zone was first introduced
in 1913, by Edward Maunder in his book &quot;Are The Planets Inhabited?&quot;. The concept was later discussed in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold, who in his treatise &quot;The Green and the Red Planet: A Physiological Study of the Possibility of Life on Mars&quot;, coined the term &quot;ecosphere&quot; and referred to various &quot;zones&quot; in which life could emerge. In the same year, Harlow Shapley wrote &quot;Liquid Water Belt&quot;, which described the same concept in further scientific detail. Both works stressed the importance of liquid water to life. Su-Shu Huang, an American astrophysicist, first introduced the term &quot;habitable zone&quot; in 1959 to refer to the area around a star where liquid water could exist on a sufficiently large body, and was the first to introduce it in the context of planetary habitability and extraterrestrial life. A major early contributor to the habitable zone concept, Huang argued in 1960 that circumstellar habitable zones, and by extension extraterrestrial life, would be uncommon in multiple star systems, given the gravitational instabilities of those systems.

The concept of habitable zones was further developed in 1964 by Stephen H. Dole in his book &quot;Habitable Planets for Man&quot;, in which he discussed the concept of the circumstellar habitable zone as well as various other determinants of planetary habitability, eventually estimating the number of habitable planets in the Milky Way to be about 600  million. At the same time, science-fiction author Isaac Asimov introduced the concept of a circumstellar habitable zone to the general public through his various explorations of space colonization. The term &quot;Goldilocks zone&quot; emerged in the 1970s, referencing specifically a region around a star whose temperature is &quot;just right&quot; for water to be present in the liquid phase. In 1993, astronomer James Kasting introduced the term &quot;circumstellar habitable zone&quot; to refer more precisely to the region then (and still) known as the habitable zone. Kasting was the first to present a detailed model for the habitable zone for exoplanets.

An update to habitable zone concept came in 2000 when astronomers Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee introduced the idea of the &quot;galactic habitable zone&quot;, which they later developed with Guillermo Gonzalez. The galactic habitable zone, defined as the region where life is most likely to emerge in a galaxy, encompasses those regions close enough to a galactic center that stars there are enriched with heavier elements, but not so close that star systems, planetary orbits, and the emergence of life would be frequently disrupted by the intense radiation and enormous gravitational forces commonly found at galactic centers.

Subsequently, some astrobiologists propose that the concept be extended to other solvents, including dihydrogen, sulfuric acid, dinitrogen, formamide, and methane, among others, which would support hypothetical life forms that use an alternative biochemistry. In 2013, further developments in habitable zone concepts were made with the proposal of a circum- &quot;planetary&quot; habitable zone, also known as the &quot;habitable edge&quot;, to encompass the region around a planet where the orbits of natural satellites would not be disrupted, and at the same time tidal heating from the planet would not cause liquid water to boil away.

It has been noted that the current term of &#x27;circumstellar habitable zone&#x27; poses confusion as the name suggests that planets within this region will possess a habitable environment. However, surface conditions are dependent on a host of different individual properties of that planet. This misunderstanding is reflected in excited reports of &#x27;habitable planets&#x27;. Since it is completely unknown whether conditions on these distant HZ worlds could host life, different terminology is needed.

==Determination==
Whether a body is in the circumstellar habitable zone of its host star is dependent on the radius of the planet&#x27;s orbit (for natural satellites, the host planet&#x27;s orbit), the mass of the body itself, and the radiative flux of the host star. Given the large spread in the masses of planets within a circumstellar habitable zone, coupled with the discovery of super-Earth planets that can sustain thicker atmospheres and stronger magnetic fields than Earth, circumstellar habitable zones are now split into two separate regions—a &quot;conservative habitable zone&quot; in which lower-mass planets like Earth can remain habitable, complemented by a larger &quot;extended habitable zone&quot; in which a planet like Venus, with stronger greenhouse effects, can have the right temperature for liquid water to exist at the surface.

===Solar System estimates===

Estimates for the habitable zone within the Solar System range from 0.38 to 10.0 astronomical units, though arriving at these estimates has been challenging for a variety of reasons. Numerous planetary mass objects orbit within, or close to, this range and as such receive sufficient sunlight to raise temperatures above the freezing point of water. However, their atmospheric conditions vary substantially.

The aphelion of Venus, for example, touches the inner edge of the zone in most estimates and, while atmospheric pressure at the surface is sufficient for liquid water, a strong greenhouse effect raises surface temperatures to at which water can only exist as vapor. The entire orbits of the Moon, Mars, and numerous asteroids also lie within various estimates of the habitable zone. Only at Mars&#x27; lowest elevations (less than 30% of the planet&#x27;s surface) is atmospheric pressure and temperature sufficient for water to, if present, exist in liquid form for short periods. At Hellas Basin, for example, atmospheric pressures can reach 1,115 Pa and temperatures above zero Celsius (about the triple point for water) for 70 days in the Martian year. Despite indirect evidence in the form of seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes, no confirmation has been made of the presence of liquid water there. While other objects orbit partly within this zone, including comets, Ceres is the only one of planetary mass. 

Despite this, studies indicate the strong possibility of past liquid water on the surface of Venus, the Moon, Mars, Vesta and Ceres, suggesting a more common phenomenon than previously thought. Since sustainable liquid water is thought to be essential to support complex life, most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus as their surface gravity allows sufficient atmosphere to be retained for several billion years.

According to the extended habitable zone concept, planetary-mass objects with atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther out from the Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth (super-Earth class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough is known about the nature of atmospheres of these kinds of extrasolar objects, and their position in the habitable zone cannot determine the net temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced albedo, anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources.

For reference, the average distance from the Sun of some major bodies within the various estimates of the habitable zone is: Mercury, 0.39 AU; Venus, 0.72 AU; Earth, 1.00 AU; Mars, 1.52 AU; Vesta, 2.36 AU; Ceres and Pallas, 2.77 AU; Jupiter, 5.20 AU; Saturn, 9.58 AU. In the most conservative estimates, only Earth lies within the zone; in the most permissive estimates, even Saturn at perihelion, or Mercury at aphelion, might be included.

===Extrasolar extrapolation===
Astronomers use stellar flux and the inverse-square law to extrapolate circumstellar habitable zone models created for the Solar System to other stars. For example, according to Kopparapu&#x27;s habitable zone estimate, although the Solar System has a circumstellar habitable zone centered at 1.34 AU from the Sun, a star with 0.25 times the luminosity of the Sun would have a habitable zone centered at formula_1, or 0.5, the distance from the star, corresponding to a distance of 0.67 AU. Various complicating factors, though, including the individual characteristics of stars themselves, mean that extrasolar extrapolation of the HZ concept is more complex.

====Spectral types and star-system characteristics====
Some scientists argue that the concept of a circumstellar habitable zone is actually limited to stars in certain types of systems or of certain spectral types. Binary systems, for example, have circumstellar habitable zones that differ from those of single-star planetary systems, in addition to the orbital stability concerns inherent with a three-body configuration. If the Solar System were such a binary system, the outer limits of the resulting circumstellar habitable zone could extend as far as 2.4 AU.

With regard to spectral types, Zoltán Balog proposes that O-type stars cannot form planets due to the photoevaporation caused by their strong ultraviolet emissions. Studying ultraviolet emissions, Andrea Buccino found that only 40% of stars studied (including the Sun) had overlapping liquid water and ultraviolet habitable zones. Stars smaller than the Sun, on the other hand, have distinct impediments to habitability. For example, Michael Hart proposed that only main-sequence stars of spectral class K0 or brighter could offer habitable zones, an idea which has evolved in modern times into the concept of a tidal locking radius for red dwarfs. Within this radius, which is coincidental with the red-dwarf habitable zone, it has been suggested that the volcanism caused by tidal heating could cause a &quot;tidal Venus&quot; planet with high temperatures and no hospitable environment for life.

Others maintain that circumstellar habitable zones are more common and that it is indeed possible for water to exist on planets orbiting cooler stars. Climate modeling from 2013 supports the idea that red dwarf stars can support planets with relatively constant temperatures over their surfaces despite tidal locking. Astronomy professor Eric Agol argues that even white dwarfs may support a relatively brief habitable zone through planetary migration. At the same time, others have written in similar support of semi-stable, temporary habitable zones around brown dwarfs. Also, a habitable zone in the outer parts of stellar systems may exist during the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution, especially around M-dwarfs, potentially lasting for billion-year timescales.

====Stellar evolution====

Circumstellar habitable zones change over time with stellar evolution. For example, hot O-type stars, which may remain on the main sequence for fewer than 10 million years, would have rapidly changing habitable zones not conducive to the development of life. Red dwarf stars, on the other hand, which can live for hundreds of billions of years on the main sequence, would have planets with ample time for life to develop and evolve. Even while stars are on the main sequence, though, their energy output steadily increases, pushing their habitable zones farther out; our Sun, for example, was 75% as bright in the Archaean as it is now, and in the future, continued increases in energy output will put Earth outside the Sun&#x27;s habitable zone, even before it reaches the red giant phase. In order to deal with this increase in luminosity, the concept of a &quot;continuously habitable zone&quot; has been introduced. As the name suggests, the continuously habitable zone is a region around a star in which planetary-mass bodies can sustain liquid water for a given period. Like the general circumstellar habitable zone, the continuously habitable zone of a star is divided into a conservative and extended region.

In red dwarf systems, gigantic stellar flares which could double a star&#x27;s brightness in minutes and huge starspots which can cover 20% of the star&#x27;s surface area, have the potential to strip an otherwise habitable planet of its atmosphere and water. As with more massive stars, though, stellar evolution changes their nature and energy flux, so by about 1.2  billion years of age, red dwarfs generally become sufficiently constant to allow for the development of life.

Once a star has evolved sufficiently to become a red giant, its circumstellar habitable zone will change dramatically from its main-sequence size. For example, the Sun is expected to engulf the previously habitable Earth as a red giant. However, once a red giant star reaches the horizontal branch, it achieves a new equilibrium and can sustain a new circumstellar habitable zone, which in the case of the Sun would range from 7 to 22 AU. At such stage, Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan would likely be habitable in Earth&#x27;s temperature sense. Given that this new equilibrium lasts for about 1 Gyr, and because life on Earth emerged by 0.7 Gyr from the formation of the Solar System at latest, life could conceivably develop on planetary mass objects in the habitable zone of red giants. However, around such a helium-burning star, important life processes like photosynthesis could only happen around planets where the atmosphere has carbon dioxide, as by the time a solar-mass star becomes a red giant, planetary-mass bodies would have already absorbed much of their free carbon dioxide. Moreover, as Ramirez and Kaltenegger (2016) showed, intense stellar winds would completely remove the atmospheres of such smaller planetary bodies, rendering them uninhabitable anyway. Thus, Titan would not be habitable even after the Sun becomes a red giant. Nevertheless, life need not originate during this stage of stellar evolution for it to be detected. Once the star becomes a red giant, and the habitable zone extends outward, the icy surface would melt, forming a temporary atmosphere that can be searched for signs of life that may have been thriving before the start of the red giant stage.

====Desert planets====
A planet&#x27;s atmospheric conditions influence its ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: desert planets (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.

====Other considerations====
A planet cannot have a hydrosphere—a key ingredient for the formation of carbon-based life—unless there is a source for water within its stellar system. The origin of water on Earth is still not completely understood; possible sources include the result of impacts with icy bodies, outgassing, mineralization, leakage from hydrous minerals from the lithosphere, and photolysis. For an extrasolar system, an icy body from beyond the frost line could migrate into the habitable zone of its star, creating an ocean planet with seas hundreds of kilometers deep such as GJ 1214 b or Kepler-22b may be.

Maintenance of liquid surface water also requires a sufficiently thick atmosphere. Possible origins of terrestrial atmospheres are currently theorized to outgassing, impact degassing, and ingassing. Atmospheres are thought to be maintained through similar processes along with biogeochemical cycles and the mitigation of atmospheric escape. In a 2013 study led by Italian astronomer Giovanni Vladilo, it was shown that the size of the circumstellar habitable zone increased with greater atmospheric pressure. Below an atmospheric pressure of about 15 millibars, it was found that habitability could not be maintained because even a small shift in pressure or temperature could render water unable to form as a liquid.

Although traditional definitions of the habitable zone assume that carbon dioxide and water vapor are the most important greenhouse gases (as they are on the Earth), a study led by Ramses Ramirez and co-author Lisa Kaltenegger has shown that the size of the habitable zone is greatly increased if prodigious volcanic outgassing of hydrogen is also included along with the carbon dioxide and water vapor. The outer edge in the Solar System would extend out as far as 2.4 AU in that case. Similar increases in the size of the habitable zone were computed for other stellar systems. An earlier study by Ray Pierrehumbert and Eric Gaidos had eliminated the CO2-H2O concept entirely, arguing that young planets could accrete many tens to hundreds of bars of hydrogen from the protoplanetary disc, providing enough of a greenhouse effect to extend the solar system outer edge to 10 AU. In this case, though, the hydrogen is not continuously replenished by volcanism and is lost within millions to tens of millions of years.

In the case of planets orbiting in the HZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, an important factor in habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013 showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.

Planetary mass natural satellites have the potential to be habitable as well. However, these bodies need to fulfill additional parameters, in particular being located within the circumplanetary habitable zones of their host planets. More specifically, moons need to be far enough from their host giant planets that they are not transformed by tidal heating into volcanic worlds like Io, but must remain within the Hill radius of the planet so that they are not pulled out of the orbit of their host planet. Red dwarfs that have masses less than 20% of that of the Sun cannot have habitable moons around giant planets, as the small size of the circumstellar habitable zone would put a habitable moon so close to the star that it would be stripped from its host planet. In such a system, a moon close enough to its host planet to maintain its orbit would have tidal heating so intense as to eliminate any prospects of habitability.

A planetary object that orbits a star with high orbital eccentricity may spend only some of its year in the HZ and experience a large variation in temperature and atmospheric pressure. This would result in dramatic seasonal phase shifts where liquid water may exist only intermittently. It is possible that subsurface habitats could be insulated from such changes and that extremophiles on or near the surface might survive through adaptions such as hibernation (cryptobiosis) and/or hyperthermostability. Tardigrades, for example, can survive in a dehydrated state temperature between and . Life on a planetary object orbiting outside HZ might hibernate on the cold side as the planet approaches the apastron where the planet is coolest and become active on approach to the periastron when the planet is sufficiently warm.

==Extrasolar discoveries==

A 2015 review concluded that the exoplanets Kepler-62f, Kepler-186f and Kepler-442b were likely the best candidates for being potentially habitable. These are at a distance of 990, 490 and 1,120 light-years away, respectively. Of these, Kepler-186f is closest in size to Earth with 1.2 times Earth&#x27;s radius, and it is located towards the outer edge of the habitable zone around its red dwarf star. Among nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidates, Tau Ceti e is 11.9 light-years away. It is in the inner edge of its planetary system&#x27;s habitable zone, giving it an estimated average surface temperature of .

Studies that have attempted to estimate the number of terrestrial planets within the circumstellar habitable zone tend to reflect the availability of scientific data. A 2013 study by Ravi Kumar Kopparapu put &quot;ηe&quot;, the fraction of stars with planets in the HZ, at 0.48, meaning that there may be roughly 95–180 billion habitable planets in the Milky Way. However, this is merely a statistical prediction; only a small fraction of these possible planets have yet been discovered.

Previous studies have been more conservative. In 2011, Seth Borenstein concluded that there are roughly 500 million habitable planets in the Milky Way. NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory 2011 study, based on observations from the Kepler mission, raised the number somewhat, estimating that about &quot;1.4 to 2.7 percent&quot; of all stars of spectral class F, G, and K are expected to have planets in their HZs.

===Early findings===

The first discoveries of extrasolar planets in the HZ occurred just a few years after the first extrasolar planets were discovered. However, these early detections were all gas giant-sized, and many were in eccentric orbits. Despite this, studies indicate the possibility of large, Earth-like moons around these planets supporting liquid water.
One of the first discoveries was 70 Virginis b, a gas giant initially nicknamed &quot;Goldilocks&quot; due to it being neither &quot;too hot&quot; nor &quot;too cold&quot;. Later study revealed temperatures analogous to Venus, ruling out any potential for liquid water. 16 Cygni Bb, also discovered in 1996, has an extremely eccentric orbit that spends only part of its time in the HZ, such an orbit would causes extreme seasonal effects. In spite of this, simulations have suggested that a sufficiently large companion could support surface water year-round.

Gliese 876 b, discovered in 1998, and Gliese 876 c, discovered in 2001, are both gas giants discovered in the habitable zone around Gliese 876 that may also have large moons. Another gas giant, Upsilon Andromedae d was discovered in 1999 orbiting Upsilon Andromidae&#x27;s habitable zone.

Announced on April 4, 2001, HD 28185 b is a gas giant found to orbit entirely within its star&#x27;s circumstellar habitable zone and has a low orbital eccentricity, comparable to that of Mars in the Solar System. Tidal interactions suggest it could harbor habitable Earth-mass satellites in orbit around it for many billions of years, though it is unclear whether such satellites could form in the first place.

HD 69830 d, a gas giant with 17 times the mass of Earth, was found in 2006 orbiting within the circumstellar habitable zone of HD 69830, 41 light years away from Earth. The following year, 55 Cancri f was discovered within the HZ of its host star 55 Cancri A. Hypothetical satellites with sufficient mass and composition are thought to be able to support liquid water at their surfaces.

Though, in theory, such giant planets could possess moons, the technology did not exist to detect moons around them, and no extrasolar moons had been discovered. Planets within the zone with the potential for solid surfaces were therefore of much higher interest.

===Habitable super-Earths===

The 2007 discovery of Gliese 581c, the first super-Earth in the circumstellar habitable zone, created significant interest in the system by the scientific community, although the planet was later found to have extreme surface conditions that may resemble Venus. Gliese 581 d, another planet in the same system and thought to be a better candidate for habitability, was also announced in 2007. Its existence was later disconfirmed in 2014, but only for a short time. As of 2015, the planet has no newer disconfirmations. Gliese 581 g, yet another planet thought to have been discovered in the circumstellar habitable zone of the system, was considered to be more habitable than both Gliese 581 c and d. However, its existence was also disconfirmed in 2014, and astronomers are divided about its existence.

Discovered in August 2011, HD 85512 b was initially speculated to be habitable, but the new circumstellar habitable zone criteria devised by Kopparapu et al. in 2013 place the planet outside the circumstellar habitable zone.

Kepler-22 b, discovered in December 2011 by the Kepler space probe, is the first transiting exoplanet discovered around a Sun-like star. With a radius 2.4 times that of Earth, Kepler-22b has been predicted by some to be an ocean planet. Gliese 667 Cc, discovered in 2011 but announced in 2012, is a super-Earth orbiting in the circumstellar habitable zone of Gliese 667 C. It is one of the most Earth-like planets known.

Gliese 163 c, discovered in September 2012 in orbit around the red dwarf Gliese 163 is located 49 light years from Earth. The planet has 6.9 Earth masses and 1.8–2.4 Earth radii, and with its close orbit receives 40 percent more stellar radiation than Earth, leading to surface temperatures of about ° C. HD 40307 g, a candidate planet tentatively discovered in November 2012, is in the circumstellar habitable zone of HD 40307. In December 2012, Tau Ceti e and Tau Ceti f were found in the circumstellar habitable zone of Tau Ceti, a Sun-like star 12 light years away. Although more massive than Earth, they are among the least massive planets found to date orbiting in the habitable zone; however, Tau Ceti f, like HD 85512 b, did not fit the new circumstellar habitable zone criteria established by the 2013 Kopparapu study. It is now considered as uninhabitable.

===Near Earth-sized planets and Solar analogs===

Recent discoveries have uncovered planets that are thought to be similar in size or mass to Earth. &quot;Earth-sized&quot; ranges are typically defined by mass. The lower range used in many definitions of the super-Earth class is 1.9 Earth masses; likewise, sub-Earths range up to the size of Venus (~0.815 Earth masses). An upper limit of 1.5 Earth radii is also considered, given that above the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating these planets have a significant fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core. A genuinely Earth-like planet – an Earth analog or &quot;Earth twin&quot; – would need to meet many conditions beyond size and mass; such properties are not observable using current technology.

A solar analog (or &quot;solar twin&quot;) is a star that resembles the Sun. No solar twin with an exact match as that of the Sun has been found. However, some stars are nearly identical to the Sun and are considered solar twins. An exact solar twin would be a G2V star with a 5,778 K temperature, be 4.6  billion years old, with the correct metallicity and a 0.1% solar luminosity variation. Stars with an age of 4.6 billion years are at the most stable state. Proper metallicity and size are also critical to low luminosity variation.

Using data collected by NASA&#x27;s Kepler space telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory, scientists have estimated that 22% of solar-type stars in the Milky Way galaxy have Earth-sized planets in their habitable zone.

On 7 January 2013, astronomers from the Kepler team announced the discovery of Kepler-69c (formerly &quot;KOI-172.02&quot;), an Earth-size exoplanet candidate (1.7 times the radius of Earth) orbiting Kepler-69, a star similar to the Sun, in the HZ and expected to offer habitable conditions. The discovery of two planets orbiting in the habitable zone of Kepler-62, by the Kepler team was announced on April 19, 2013. The planets, named Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f, are likely solid planets with sizes 1.6 and 1.4 times the radius of Earth, respectively.

With a radius estimated at 1.1 Earth, Kepler-186f, discovery announced in April 2014, is the closest yet size to Earth of an exoplanet confirmed by the transit method though its mass remains unknown and its parent star is not a Solar analog.

Kapteyn b, discovered in June 2014 is a possible rocky world of about 4.8 Earth masses and about 1.5 Earth radii were found orbiting the habitable zone of the red subdwarf Kapteyn&#x27;s Star, 12.8 light-years away.

On 6 January 2015, NASA announced the 1000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope. Three of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars: two of the three, Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, are near-Earth-size and likely rocky; the third, Kepler-440b, is a super-Earth. However, Kepler-438b is found to be a subject of powerful flares, so it is now considered uninhabitable. 16 January, K2-3d a planet of 1.5 Earth radii was found orbiting within the habitable zone of K2-3, receiving 1.4 times the intensity of visible light as Earth.

Kepler-452b, announced on 23 July 2015 is 50% bigger than Earth, likely rocky and takes approximately 385 Earth days to orbit the habitable zone of its G-class (solar analog) star Kepler-452.

The discovery of a system of three tidally locked planets orbiting the habitable zone of an ultracool dwarf star, TRAPPIST-1, was announced in May 2016. The discovery is considered significant because it dramatically increases the possibility of smaller, cooler, more numerous and closer stars possessing habitable planets.

Two potentially habitable planets, discovered by the K2 mission in July 2016 orbiting around the M dwarf K2-72 around 227 light years from the Sun: K2-72c and K2-72e are both of similar size to Earth and receive similar amounts of stellar radiation.

Announced on the 20 April 2017, LHS 1140b is a super-dense super-Earth 39 light years away, 6.6 times Earth&#x27;s mass and 1.4 times radius, its star 15% the mass of the Sun but with much less observable stellar flare activity than most M dwarfs. The planet is one of few observable by both transit and radial velocity that&#x27;s mass is confirmed with an atmosphere may be studied.

Discovered by radial velocity in June 2017, with approximately three times the mass of Earth, Luyten b orbits within the habitable zone of Luyten&#x27;s Star just 12.2 light-years away.

At 11 light-years away, the second closest planet, Ross 128 b, was announced in November 2017 following a decade&#x27;s radial velocity study of relatively &quot;quiet&quot; red dwarf star Ross 128. At 1.35 times Earth&#x27;s mass, is it roughly Earth-sized and likely rocky in composition.

Discovered in March 2018, K2-155d is about 1.64 times the radius of Earth, is likely rocky and orbits in the habitable zone of its red dwarf star 203 light years away.

One of the earliest discoveries by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) announced on July 31, 2019, is a Super-Earth planet GJ 357 d orbiting the outer edge of a red dwarf 31 light years away.

K2-18b is an exoplanet 124 light-years away, orbiting in the habitable zone of the K2-18, a red dwarf. This planet is significant for water vapor found in its atmosphere; this was announced on September 17, 2019.

In September 2020, astronomers identified 24 superhabitable planet (planets better than Earth) contenders, from among more than 4000 confirmed exoplanets at present, based on astrophysical parameters, as well as the natural history of known life forms on the Earth.

==Habitability outside the HZ==

Liquid-water environments have been found to exist in the absence of atmospheric pressure and at temperatures outside the HZ temperature range. For example, Saturn&#x27;s moons Titan and Enceladus and Jupiter&#x27;s moons Europa and Ganymede, all of which are outside the habitable zone, may hold large volumes of liquid water in subsurface oceans.

Outside the HZ, tidal heating and radioactive decay are two possible heat sources that could contribute to the existence of liquid water. Abbot and Switzer (2011) put forward the possibility that subsurface water could exist on rogue planets as a result of radioactive decay-based heating and insulation by a thick surface layer of ice.

With some theorising that life on Earth may have actually originated in stable, subsurface habitats, it has been suggested that it may be common for wet subsurface extraterrestrial habitats such as these to &#x27;teem with life&#x27;. On Earth itself, living organisms may be found more than below the surface.

Another possibility is that outside the HZ organisms may use alternative biochemistries that do not require water at all. Astrobiologist Christopher McKay, has suggested that methane () may be a solvent conducive to the development of &quot;cryolife&quot;, with the Sun&#x27;s &quot;methane habitable zone&quot; being centered on from the star. This distance is coincident with the location of Titan, whose lakes and rain of methane make it an ideal location to find McKay&#x27;s proposed cryolife. In addition, testing of a number of organisms has found some are capable of surviving in extra-HZ conditions.

==Significance for complex and intelligent life==
The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that complex and intelligent life is uncommon and that the HZ is one of many critical factors. According to Ward &amp; Brownlee (2004) and others, not only is a HZ orbit and surface water a primary requirement to sustain life but a requirement to support the secondary conditions required for multicellular life to emerge and evolve. The secondary habitability factors are both geological (the role of surface water in sustaining necessary plate tectonics) and biochemical (the role of radiant energy in supporting photosynthesis for necessary atmospheric oxygenation). But others, such as Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen in their 2002 book &quot;Evolving the Alien&quot; argue that complex intelligent life may arise outside the HZ. Intelligent life outside the HZ may have evolved in subsurface environments, from alternative biochemistries or even from nuclear reactions.

On Earth, several complex multicellular life forms (or eukaryotes) have been identified with the potential to survive conditions that might exist outside the conservative habitable zone. Geothermal energy sustains ancient circumvent ecosystems, supporting large complex life forms such as &quot;Riftia pachyptila&quot;. Similar environments may be found in oceans pressurised beneath solid crusts, such as those of Europa and Enceladus, outside of the habitable zone. Numerous microorganisms have been tested in simulated conditions and in low Earth orbit, including eukaryotes. An animal example is the &quot;Milnesium tardigradum&quot;, which can withstand extreme temperatures well above the boiling point of water and the cold vacuum of outer space. A desert moss, &quot;Syntrichia caninervis&quot; is one of few plants believed capable of surviving on Mars. In addition, the lichens &quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot; and &quot;Xanthoria elegans&quot; have been found to survive in an environment where the atmospheric pressure is far too low for surface liquid water and where the radiant energy is also much lower than that which most plants require to photosynthesize. The fungi &quot;Cryomyces antarcticus&quot; and &quot;Cryomyces minteri&quot; are also able to survive and reproduce in Mars-like conditions.

Species, including humans, known to possess animal cognition require large amounts of energy, and have adapted to specific conditions, including an abundance of atmospheric oxygen and the availability of large quantities of chemical energy synthesized from radiant energy. If humans are to colonize other planets, true Earth analogs in the HZ are most likely to provide the closest natural habitat; this concept was the basis of Stephen H. Dole&#x27;s 1964 study. With suitable temperature, gravity, atmospheric pressure and the presence of water, the necessity of spacesuits or space habitat analogs on the surface may be eliminated, and complex Earth life can thrive.

Planets in the HZ remain of paramount interest to researchers looking for intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. The Drake equation, sometimes used to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, contains the factor or parameter , which is the average number of planetary-mass objects orbiting within the HZ of each star. A low value lends support to the Rare Earth hypothesis, which posits that intelligent life is a rarity in the Universe, whereas a high value provides evidence for the Copernican mediocrity principle, the view that habitability—and therefore life—is common throughout the Universe. A 1971 NASA report by Drake and Bernard Oliver proposed the &quot;water hole&quot;, based on the spectral absorption lines of the hydrogen and hydroxyl components of water, as a good, obvious band for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence that has since been widely adopted by astronomers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. According to Jill Tarter, Margaret Turnbull and many others, HZ candidates are the priority targets to narrow waterhole searches and the Allen Telescope Array now extends Project Phoenix to such candidates.

Because the HZ is considered the most likely habitat for intelligent life, METI efforts have also been focused on systems likely to have planets there. The 2001 Teen Age Message and 2003 Cosmic Call 2, for example, were sent to the 47 Ursae Majoris system, known to contain three Jupiter-mass planets and possibly with a terrestrial planet in the HZ. The Teen Age Message was also directed to the 55 Cancri system, which has a gas giant in its HZ. A Message from Earth in 2008, and Hello From Earth in 2009, were directed to the Gliese 581 system, containing three planets in the HZ—Gliese 581 c, d, and the unconfirmed g.

<doc id="1072756" wikidata="Q6144794" url="?curid=1072756" title="USS Bluefish (SS-222)">
<text>USS &quot;Bluefish&quot; (SS-222), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bluefish. Between 9 September 1943 and 29 July 1945 she completed nine war patrols. Her operating area extended from the Netherlands East Indies to the waters south of Honshū. According to the notoriously unreliable JANAC accounting, &quot;Bluefish&quot; sank 12 Japanese ships totaling 50,839 tons.

==Construction and training==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; was laid down 5 June 1942 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, CT. She was launched 21 February 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. Robert Y. Menzie), and commissioned 24 May 1943. &quot;Bluefish&quot; departed New London 21 July and reported to Task Force 72 (TF 72) at Brisbane, Australia on 21 August 1943.

*On 8 September 1943, a Royal Australian Air Force Catalina flying boat mistakenly strafed &quot;Bluefish&quot; in the Timor Sea north of Melville Island.

==First war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Brisbane on 9 September 1943 to patrol the South China Sea for 25 days. On 25 September &quot;Bluefish&quot; torpedoed the Japanese merchantman &quot;Akashi Maru&quot; (3228 GRT) south-east of Celebes, Netherlands East Indies, in the Flores Sea. While following the damaged &quot;Akashi Maru&quot;, &quot;Bluefish&quot; torpedoed and sank the Japanese torpedo boat &quot;Kasasagi&quot; (595 tons) on 27 September about south of Celebes. On 29 September &quot;Bluefish&quot; found and sank the damaged &quot;Akashi Maru&quot; north of Wetar.

==Second war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Fremantle in October 1943 for a 32-day patrol of the South China Sea. On 8 November &quot;Bluefish&quot; torpedoed and sank the Japanese tanker &quot;Kyokuei Maru&quot; (10570 GRT) in the South China Sea. On 18 November &quot;Bluefish&quot; torpedoed and sank the old escorting destroyer IJN &quot;Sanae&quot; and damaged the Japanese fleet oiler &quot;Ondo&quot; (14050 GRT) in the Celebes Sea about south of Basilan Island.

==Third war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Fremantle in December 1943 for a 27-day patrol of the South China Sea. On 30 December, she sank the Japanese oiler &quot;Ichiyu Maru&quot; (5061 GRT) in the Java Sea. After laying mines off the eastern Malayan coast on 3 January 1944, &quot;Bluefish&quot; attacked a Japanese convoy off Indo-China together with &quot;Rasher&quot;. &quot;Bluefish&quot; torpedoed and sank the Japanese tanker &quot;Hakko Maru&quot; (6046 GRT) on 4 January.

==Fourth war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Fremantle in February 1944 under the command of Charles M. Henderson for a 58-day patrol of the South China Sea. on 4 March &quot;Bluefish&quot; torpedoed and sank the Japanese oiler &quot;Ominesan Maru&quot; (10536 GRT) in the South China Sea about west of Miri, Sarawak.

==Fifth war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Fremantle in May 1944 for a 53-day patrol of the Celebes Sea. On 16 June, she sank the Japanese merchant &quot;Nanshin Maru&quot; (1422 GRT) in the Celebes Sea south-west of Tarakan, Borneo. On 21 June, she sank the Japanese transport &quot;Kanan Maru&quot; (3280 GRT) off the southern approaches to Makassar Strait.

==Sixth war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Fremantle in July 1944 for a 54-day patrol to Pearl Harbor. On 14 August, she sank the tanker &quot;Shinpo Maru&quot; (5,135 GRT), damaged by on 12 August, off Golo Island. On 19 August, &quot;Bluefish&quot; attacked convoy Hi-71, sinking the Japanese fleet tanker/seaplane carrier Hayasui (18,300 GRT) some northwest of Cape Bolinao and damaging the Japanese transport &quot;Awa Maru&quot; (11,249 GRT) at .

==Seventh war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor in February 1945 for an unproductive 42-day patrol of Japanese coastal waters.

==Eighth war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor in April 1945 under the command of George W. Forbes for an unproductive 38-day patrol to Fremantle.

==Ninth war patrol==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; departed Fremantle in June 1945 for a 33-day patrol of the South China Sea. On 15 July, she sank the Japanese submarine (2650 tons) in the South China Sea about east-north-east of Natuna Besar off Borneo. Four days later, she sank a &quot;No.1-class&quot; submarine chaser by gunfire east of Sumatra, Netherlands East Indies, at .

==Post-war operations==
With the cessation of hostilities, &quot;Bluefish&quot; returned to the United States, arriving at Philadelphia Navy Yard 9 October 1945. She was placed in the 16th Fleet and on 31 October moved to the Submarine Base, New London. She was later towed to Electric Boat Co., Groton, where she underwent repairs. On 12 June 1946 she returned to New London where she went out of commission in reserve 12 February 1947.

&quot;Bluefish&quot; was recommissioned 7 January 1952 at the Submarine Base, New London, and reported to Submarine Division 82, Atlantic Fleet. On 7 April she proceeded to Key West, Florida, and reported to Submarine Division 41 on 11 April. She operated along the Florida coast and in the Caribbean, engaging in local operations and training exercises until May 1953.

On 7 June 1953 &quot;Bluefish&quot; arrived at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. Following pre-inactivation overhaul at the shipyard, she was placed out of commission in reserve at New London 20 November 1953.

<text>David Wyman Patten (November 14, 1799 – October 25, 1838) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He was killed at the Battle of Crooked River and is regarded as a martyr by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church of Jesus Christ). He is referred to twice in the Church of Jesus Christ&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants—once in section 114 and posthumously in section 124.

==Early life==
Patten was born to Benoni and Edith Cole Patten in Vermont, and moved to Theresa, New York, as a young child. He was the 11th of 13 children. He was around 6&#x27;1&quot; and of a dark complexion. As a youth, Patten moved to the town of Dundee in eastern Michigan. While there, at the age of 28 he married Phoebe Ann Babcock in 1828. The two had one stillborn child; they had no children live to adulthood. Patten allied himself with the local Methodist congregation during this time, all the while professing a belief that there was &quot;no true religion on the earth.&quot;

==Conversion==
In 1830, Patten heard about the publication of the Book of Mormon. He became &quot;greatly agitated in mind and desired to see it.&quot; That summer, he had the opportunity to read the preface and the Testimony of the Three Witnesses that was attached to the book. Two years later, Patten learned that his brother John had recently joined the Church of Christ (the original name of the church founded by Joseph Smith). Excited, David rode three hundred miles to his brother&#x27;s house in Fairplay, Indiana, to investigate the church. On June 15, 1832, Patten was baptized by his brother.

== Missions and church service ==
Patten served several short missions for the church, and was one of the first missionaries to visit the southern United States. Two days after his baptism, Patten was ordained an elder by Elisha H. Groves, and soon after sent on a mission to Michigan Territory. On this trip, he was accompanied by another recent convert, Joseph Wood. Together, the two traveled for 23 days without much food or money, instead relying on nearby families for sustenance and a place to sleep. This assignment lasted &quot;a short season,&quot; during which time Patten baptized his wife. Healing was a distinctive feature of Patten&#x27;s missionary labors. Abraham O. Smoot said that &quot;he never knew an instance in which David&#x27;s petition for the sick was not answered.&quot; Patten described some accounts of his healing: &quot;Jesus called upon me to lay hands on [Brother] Coltrain who accidentally burned his hand and he received no harm. Brother William Smith had a pain in his eye and I laid my hand on him in the name of Jesus Christ and the pain left him.&quot;

Patten was ordained a high priest by Hyrum Smith on September 2, 1832.

At the end of 1832, several missionaries, including Patten, were sent to states on the east coast in response to a revelation received by Joseph Smith in September of the same year. Over the next few months, Patten traveled with other missionaries, including John Murdock, William Smith, Zebedee Coltrin, John F. Boynton, Hyrum Smith, and Reynolds Cahoon. Patten began preaching in Ohio and made his way to Pennsylvania, and then to New York and back to Kirtland, Ohio, the headquarters of the church. He returned home on February 15, 1833, and within a month was called on his third mission, this time to preach near Theresa, New York, where his mother and some of his siblings lived. Patten left on March 25, 1833, accompanied by Reynolds Cahoon. During their journey, the two visited congregations of church members along the way and advised them to move to Kirtland. During one of these visits, a heckler interrupted a meeting in Avon, New York, ridiculing the missionaries and refusing to be quiet. Patten told him to be quiet or he would &quot;put him out&quot;, to which the heckler responded, &quot;You can&#x27;t do it.&quot; Patten answered &quot;In the name of the Lord, I will&quot; and picked the man up with both hands, took him to the back door, and reportedly threw him ten feet into a wood pile. This story became a popular tale for early members of the church.

Patten was known to sing using the gift of Tongues. On February 27, 1833 Sidney Rigdon interpreted a song of Patten&#x27;s and transcribed it into Revelation Book 2. They hymn was about Enoch&#x27;s vision as found in Joseph Smith&#x27;s revision of Genesis. The interpreted hymn was mailed to Independence, MO where W.W. Phelps published it, unattributed, in the May 1833 edition of the Evening and Morning Star. Sometime before publication the text was adapted into a song with meter and rhyming. The original hymn was never published.

By May 1833, Patten and his companion had arrived at Theresa. They stayed their first night there at the house of Patten&#x27;s brother Archibald. After remaining in Theresa and preaching for a few weeks, on May 20, 1833, Patten&#x27;s mother was baptized by Brigham Young, as were two of Patten&#x27;s brothers, Ira and Archibald, and two sisters, Polly and Betsy. After a while, Patten traveled south to Henderson, New York, where he preached and converted eighty people. After that, Patten returned to Kirtland. In the time following his mission, he worked on constructing the Kirtland Temple and moved his family from Michigan to Ohio.

Altogether, Patten served twelve short missions for the church in the eastern United States in 1832 and 1833 and in Tennessee with Warren Parrish in 1834. During this time, he was persecuted by mobs while establishing numerous branches of the church.

Nancy Alexander Tracy, an early member of the church who converted at age sixteen, wrote of Patten: &quot;I could at a glance see the noble spirit he possessed beaming in his countenance, and when he began to speak it was with such force and power. Before he was half through I could have borne my testimony of the truth of the gospel and doctrine he was preaching.&quot;
==Apostleship==
Patten became one of the original apostles of the Church of the Latter Day Saints on February 15, 1835, receiving his ordination from Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, jointly known as the Three Witnesses. He served as an apostle from 1835 until his death in 1838.

In late 1836, Patten settled in Far West, Missouri. On February 10, 1838, Thomas B. Marsh and Patten were called to serve as Presidents &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the church in Missouri until the president of the church, Joseph Smith, and his counselor Sidney Rigdon returned. Later that year, on April 6, 1838, when Marsh was called to be President &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the church by himself, Patten was appointed to be Marsh&#x27;s assistant; fellow apostle Brigham Young also served as an assistant to Marsh. Latter Day Saints in Missouri began to refer to Patten by the nickname &quot;Captain Fear-Not.&quot;

Doctrine and Covenants section 114, delivered April 17, 1838, is directed to Patten, in which he is called to serve another mission.

==Story of meeting Cain==
Patten is reportedly the source of a story which has become a part of Mormon folklore. As related by Abraham O. Smoot after Patten&#x27;s death, Patten says he encountered a very tall, hairy, dark-skinned man in Paris, Tennessee, who said that he was Cain. The account states that Cain, the son of Adam from the Bible, had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men. 

The recollection of Patten&#x27;s story is quoted in Spencer W. Kimball&#x27;s &quot;The Miracle of Forgiveness&quot;. In the 1980s, Patten&#x27;s story was used by some Latter-day Saints to explain Bigfoot sightings in South Weber, Utah.

==Battle of Crooked River==
Patten died due to wounds received in the Battle of Crooked River. This conflict was primarily caused by deteriorating conditions between Mormon settlers and other religious groups in Missouri. As tensions between Mormon and non-Mormon groups increased, a group of men from the state militia abducted three Mormon men on October 24, 1838. In response, Patten led a group of Mormon men to rescue the men. Before daybreak on the 25th, as the Mormon militia approached the ford where the state militia was camped, a non-Mormon guard, John Lockhart, called out, &quot;Who goes there?&quot; and immediately fired at the Mormons. The shot hit Patrick O&#x27;Bannion, one of Patten&#x27;s guides, and mortally wounded him. Crying, &quot;God and liberty,&quot; Patten ordered a charge and led the Mormon militia in the attack. Patten, who was serving as commander of the Mormon militia group, was shot in the bowels. The three men who had been held by the state militia were rescued. 

The wounded Patten was carried from the battlefield to the home of Stephen Winchester, four miles distant. En route he was visited by Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, and his wife. Patten reiterated his testimony of the church to his visitors. Upon seeing her husband dying, Ann Patten exclaimed, &quot;Oh God! Oh my husband! How pale you look.&quot; His final words to his wife were, &quot;Whatever you do else, O do not deny the faith,&quot; after which he addressed the others in the room. Moments after this, about 10 p.m., he died. Regarding Patten&#x27;s death, Joseph Smith said, &quot;There lies a man who has done just as he said he would—he has laid down his life for his friends.&quot; Patten was buried in an unmarked grave on October 27, 1838, in Far West, Missouri.
==Legacy==
After Patten&#x27;s death, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles did not have twelve apostles again until 1841, when Lyman Wight was ordained. Between Patten’s death and Wight&#x27;s ordination, John E. Page, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, George A. Smith, and Willard Richards had been ordained and added to the Quorum to replace Patten and apostles who had been excommunicated.

Shortly after the Battle of Crooked River, Missouri Executive Order 44 was issued by Missouri Governor Lilburn W. Boggs. Only days later, the Latter Day Saints living in the community of Haun&#x27;s Mill were attacked by a mob and experienced many casualties. These events ultimately led to the expulsion of the Latter Day Saints from Missouri.

After Patten&#x27;s death, Wilford Woodruff lionized Patten as a martyr and ascribed unspecified miraculous healings to his administration. In Doctrine and Covenants section 124, a revelation states, &quot;David Patten I have taken unto myself; behold, his priesthood no man taketh from him.&quot;

<doc id="1072763" wikidata="Q1432521" url="?curid=1072763" title="Making Mr. Right">
<text>Making Mr. Right is a 1987 American science fiction romantic comedy film directed by Susan Seidelman; starring John Malkovich as Jeff Peters/Ulysses and Ann Magnuson as Frankie Stone. It is a loose remake of the 1967 Soviet science fiction film &quot;His Name Was Robert&quot;.

This film is primarily about the misadventures between an android and a woman.

==Plot==
Dr. Jeff Peters (John Malkovich) is an emotionally repressed scientist who cannot stand others because of their intellectual inferiority. He dreams of deep space exploration, which would be difficult because of the lack of human contact for long periods of time. He develops the Ulysses android (which looks exactly like him) for the purpose of space exploration, since an android would not be affected by the isolation.

Frankie Stone (Ann Magnuson) is hired to do public relations for the project. She meets project manager Dr. Ramdas (Harsh Nayyar) and Jeff, who both give Frankie an overview of the Ulysses project. As a part of her job, she must get to know the android better, in order to &quot;humanize&quot; him for the benefit of the project&#x27;s sponsors in Congress. However, in his interaction with her, the android develops emotions and develops better social skills than Jeff himself. At one point, the android impersonates Jeff in order to leave the laboratory, and stows away in Frankie&#x27;s Chevrolet Corvair. After escaping, he encounters human society at a shopping mall, buys a tuxedo, goes on a date with a woman named Sandy McCleary (Laurie Metcalf) who thinks he is Jeff, reducing her to an emotional wreck, and then loses his head (literally) over Frankie&#x27;s best friend Trish (Glenne Headly) who has taken refuge in Frankie&#x27;s apartment after walking out on her husband who is a star on the popular daytime soap opera &quot;New Jersey&quot;.

Frankie also develops feelings for the android and befriends Jeff on a lesser level. Frankie&#x27;s mother Estelle Stone, (Polly Bergen) learns from Frankie&#x27;s ex-boyfriend&#x27;s mother that Frankie has a doctor boyfriend (Jeff) and expects Frankie to bring him to the wedding of Frankie&#x27;s sister Ivy Stone. Frankie persuades Jeff to come, but Ulysses again absconds from the lab and gate-crashes the wedding. Trish&#x27;s jealous TV-star husband crashes the wedding as well and gets into a fight with Ulysses. Ulysses short-circuits and crashes into the swimming pool, turning the occasion into a public relations disaster. Frankie is fired from her job and forbidden contact with Ulysses or anyone on the project. She then uses her connections with a former client and boyfriend Steve Marcus, a candidate for Congress to attend Ulysses’ launch day in an attempt to say goodbye to Ulysses, but is rebuffed by Jeff and then forced to leave by Dr. Ramdas. Ulysses then gives his farewell speech, in which he bemoans humanity&#x27;s difficulty in forming relationships, both platonic and romantic.

However, Ulysses appears at Frankie&#x27;s front door during the launch; Jeff actually presented that final speech himself, having realized his creation has become more empathic than him. As the lack of human contact of a seven-year space mission will not be a hardship for him due to asociality, Jeff decided to go into space while the android takes his place on Earth so Ulysses and Frankie (who by now are deeply in love) can be together.

<doc id="1072764" wikidata="Q9002343" url="?curid=1072764" title="Heber C. Kimball">
<text>Heber Chase Kimball (June 14, 1801 – June 22, 1868) was a leader in the early Latter Day Saint movement. He served as one of the original twelve apostles in the early Church of the Latter Day Saints, and as first counselor to Brigham Young in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) for more than two decades, from 1847 until his death.

Agreeing to take on plural marriage, then practiced by the church, Kimball eventually married 43 women, but some relationships were for caretaking. He had a total of 66 children by 17 of his wives.

==Early life==
Heber Chase Kimball was born in Sheldon, Franklin County, Vermont, on June 14, 1801. He was a descendant of the Kimball immigrants to Massachusetts from England in 1634. He was named after judge Heber Chase, who had helped the family in their efforts to settle in the area. His father, Solomon F. Kimball, worked as a blacksmith and maintained a farm. Due to the embargo on trade with Britain preceding the War of 1812, his father lost his investments and the family moved to western New York. They settled in West Bloomfield, New York, Ontario County, around 1811.

===Education and training===

Kimball left school at age 14, trained as a blacksmith and potter, and moved with his brother in about 1820 to Mendon, Monroe County, New York. There, he married his first wife, Vilate Murray, in November 1822.

After purchasing his brother&#x27;s pottery business, for the next 10 years he carried out his trades. He acquired five and a half acres (22,000 m²) of land, built a house and a barn, and planted an orchard.

===Masonry===

In 1823, Kimball received the three craft degrees of Freemasonry in the lodge at Victor Flats, Ontario County, New York. In 1824, he sent a petition to the chapter at Canandaigua, New York, to receive the York Rite degrees of Royal Arch Masonry. His petition was accepted, although, as he reported, Anti-Masons had burned down the chapter building in Canandaigua. Many years later, Kimball reminisced of his New York masonic experiences and stated: &quot;I wish that all men were masons and would live up to their profession, then the world would be in a much better state than it is now.&quot;

When the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints established itself in Nauvoo, Illinois, Kimball was one of the original petitioners to establish a Freemasonry lodge there. He served as Nauvoo Lodge U.D.&#x27;s first Junior Deacon. He remained active in Freemasonry throughout his stay in Nauvoo, but was not active once he moved to Utah Territory. There was no lodge in Utah in his lifetime that would admit Mormons.

===Early family life===
Several of Kimball&#x27;s close family members died of tuberculosis within a few years: his mother in February 1824, his father in the spring of 1826, followed by his brother Charles C. and his brother&#x27;s wife shortly thereafter.

His son William Henry was born in Mendon, April 10, 1826; he was Kimball&#x27;s first child to survive infancy. His daughter Helen Mar was born August 22, 1828. She was the only daughter to survive.

===Signs in the heavens===
Kimball claims to have witnessed a miraculous event on September 22, 1827. According to his autobiography, he subsequently learned that it &quot;took place the same evening that Joseph Smith received the records of the Book of Mormon from the Angel Moroni.&quot; He had seen &quot;a white smoke&quot; arising on the horizon, growing &quot;clear and transparent of a bluish cast&quot; to reveal an army on the move &quot;in platoons&quot;:

We could see distinctly the muskets, bayonets, and knapsacks of the men, who wore caps and feathers like those used by the American soldiers in the last war with Britain; also their officers with their swords and equipage, and heard the clashing and jingling of their instruments of war and could discover the form and features of the men. The most profound order existed throughout the entire army, when the foremost man stepped, every man stepped at the same time: I could hear the step. When the front rank reached the Western horizon a battle ensued, as we could distinctly hear the report of the arms and the rush. No man could judge of my feelings when I beheld that army of men, as plainly as I ever saw armies of men in the flesh it seemed as though every hair of my head was alive. This scenery was gazed upon for hours, until it began to disappear.

==Joining the Latter Day Saint movement==
While in New York, Kimball joined the local Baptist Church and was eventually baptized. Three weeks later, three elders from the Church of Christ, the original name of the Latter Day Saint church founded by Joseph Smith, visited the house of his friend, Phineas Young. Kimball visited the house at this time and was impressed with church teachings. He also witnessed the speaking of tongues and the interpretation of tongues during this visit. He claims to have been visited by the power of God.

During this time, Kimball said that he and several of the Young family saw a vision opened of the &quot;gathering of the Saints to Zion.&quot; He was inspired to travel to Pennsylvania where he could visit at length with the elders, and was accompanied by some of the Youngs. They stayed six days with the elders and witnessed more miracles, such as speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues.

On April 16, 1832, Kimball was baptized by Alpheus Gifford. in Mendon. Vilate Kimball followed him two weeks later. After the confirmation, the elder offered to ordain Kimball to the priesthood, but Kimball refused it as he felt he was unready. 30 more people were baptized in Mendon and formed a branch of the church there.

==Church service==
Shortly after his baptism, Kimball was ordained an elder by Joseph Young. He began proselyting in the neighboring areas with Joseph and Brigham Young. This part of New York became known as the &quot;burnt over district&quot; because of the numerous religious sects that sprang up during the 19th century. The Youngs baptized many people and built up branches of the church. Kimball said that one day Ezra Landon baptized some 20 people but wanted him to confirm them. He did so, and immediately they began speaking in tongues and interpreting them.

In the fall of 1833, Kimball relocated his family to church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. He marched with Zion&#x27;s Camp in 1834; however, after contracting cholera, he returned to Kirtland before the rest of the crew. He then attended the School of the Prophets and witnessed the completion of the Kirtland Temple. From 1832 until 1840, Kimball served eight missions for the church, requiring him to be apart from his family for months at a time.

==Quorum of the Twelve==

On February 14, 1835, Kimball was ordained a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles of the Church of the Latter Day Saints (renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838). He was one of the original twelve members of the Quorum, being 4th in seniority.

Joseph Smith called Kimball to lead a group of missionaries to England in 1837. The mission began work in Preston, Lancashire, England. This was the church&#x27;s first proselyting effort in England. After the initial baptisms in Preston, the missionaries expanded their efforts to the Ribble Valley. By the time Kimball departed for the United States in 1838, about 1,500 people had been baptized.

Kimball returned with a small party to make travel arrangements for the groups and discovered the Latter Day Saints were undergoing considerable strife and pressure in the state of Missouri.

While Smith was imprisoned in the Liberty Jail, Brigham Young (now ranking leader of the Quorum) and Kimball organized the removal of approximately 12,000 Latter Day Saint refugees across the border into Illinois. There the church founded the city of Nauvoo and built a temple. Kimball served on the Nauvoo City Council.

In September 1839, Kimball left Nauvoo for another mission to England. He did not reach Indiana until October. He made stops at Kirtland to encourage the remaining Saints there to move to Nauvoo and other places and had a long layover in New York City. He sailed from New York on December 19, reaching Liverpool on April 6. Kimball spent 1840 and some of 1841 in England, initially in the area in and around Preston, and later working as a missionary in London. The missionaries began organizing groups of British converts to travel to the United States, beginning in 1840, and to join the main body of the church.

After Smith was killed in 1844, succession to the leadership of the church was a divisive issue. Young led the majority of church members across the state line into Iowa and eventually to the Salt Lake Valley. In July 1847, Kimball was one of the first Mormon pioneers to reach the valley. Kimball stood next in leadership in the Quorum to Young.

==First Presidency==
Kimball became a member of the new First Presidency in 1847. Kimball led one of three large companies to the Salt Lake Valley in the summer of 1848. He established his families in Utah Territory (he had three wives) and supported them by farming, ranching, milling at the Heber C. Kimball Gristmill, and freighting, in addition to church responsibilities. While in the First Presidency, Kimball received special assignments to supervise the ongoing British Mission and to conduct temple ordinances. He also worked to encourage economic independence for Utah. At speaking in a meeting in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, Kimball promised his audience that &quot;in less than six months, clothing and other goods would be sold in the streets of Salt Lake City cheaper than they could be purchased in New York City.&quot; The ensuing California Gold Rush then made this promise possible.

He used one slave, Green Flake, who was given to the church for tithing, as his personal driver.

==Government service==
When the provisional government of the State of Deseret was organized in spring 1849, Kimball was appointed the chief justice and lieutenant governor of the proposed state.

Kimball served in the Utah Territorial Legislature in the upper house (the Territorial Council) from 1851 until 1858. He was president of the Council during the session beginning in March 1851, but later served as a regular member of the Council.

==Death==

A personal friend of Kimball wrote, one night at family prayers, Kimball said that &quot;the angel Moroni had visited him the night before and informed him that his work on this earth was finished, and he would soon be taken!&quot; Kimball died the following day on June 22, 1868, at age 67, in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, from the effects of a fall. He was buried in the Kimball-Whitney Cemetery (40.772949, -111.889755), located on the south slope of what&#x27;s now known as Capitol Hill, an area then called &quot;Heber&#x27;s Bench&quot; after him.

==Family==
Kimball received private instruction from Joseph Smith on plural marriage (polygamy). Initially reluctant, Kimball accepted the responsibility and married a second wife, Sarah Noon. His first wife, Vilate Murray Kimball, accepted plural marriage after reportedly claiming independent revelation directly to her that it matched what &quot;the Lord has shown me” and welcomed the additional wives as sisters. Heber and Vilate agreed to give their 14-year-old daughter Helen Mar as a plural wife of Joseph Smith. Kimball considered the marrying of multiple wives an expression of his faith in and obedience to God: &quot;I have noticed that a man who has but one wife, and is inclined to that doctrine, soon begins to wither and dry up, while a man who goes into plurality [of wives] looks fresh, young, and sprightly. Why is this? Because God loves that man, and because he honors His work and word.&quot;

===Wives and children===
Kimball eventually married a total of forty-three women, although it is stated that many of these marriages were merely caretaking arrangements lacking physical intimacy. Kimball had sixty-six children by seventeen of his wives.
