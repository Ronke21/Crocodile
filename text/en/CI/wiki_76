<text>New feminism is a form of feminism that emphasizes the integral complementarity of women and men, rather than the superiority of men over women or women over men, and advocates for respecting persons from conception to natural death.

New feminism, as a form of difference feminism, supports the idea that men and women have different strengths, perspectives, and roles, while advocating for the equal worth and dignity of both sexes. Among its basic concepts are that biological differences are significant and do not compromise sexual equality. New feminism holds that women should be valued in their role as child bearers, that women and men are individuals equal in worth, and that in social, economic, and legal senses they should be equal, while accepting the differences between the sexes.

== History ==
The term was originally used in Britain in the 1920s to distinguish &quot;new feminists&quot; from traditional mainstream suffragist feminism. These women, also referred to as &quot;welfare feminists&quot;, were particularly concerned with motherhood, like their opposite numbers in Germany at the time, Helene Stöcker and her Bund für Mutterschutz. New feminists campaigned strongly in favour of such measures as family allowances paid directly to mothers. They were also largely supportive of protective legislation in industry. A major proponent of this was Eleanor Rathbone of the suffragist-successor society, the &quot;National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship&quot;.

&quot;New feminists&quot; were opposed mainly by young women, especially those in the Six Point Group, particularly Winifred Holtby, Vera Brittain, and Dorothy Evans, who saw this as a retrograde step towards the separate spheres ideology of the 19th century. They were particularly opposed to protective legislation, which they saw as being in practice restrictive legislation, which kept women out of better-paid jobs on the pretext of health and welfare considerations.

=== Recent use ===
In recent years, the term has been revived by feminists responding to Pope John Paul II&#x27;s call for a &quot;&#x27;new feminism&#x27; which rejects the temptation of imitating models of &#x27;male domination&#x27; in order to acknowledge and affirm the true genius of women in every aspect of the life of society and overcome all discrimination, violence and exploitation . . . &#x27;Reconcile people with life&#x27;&quot;. John Paul II links the new feminism of pro-life, pro-person advocacy to the feminine genius identified in his 1988 apostolic letter &quot;Mulieris Dignitatem&quot;, or, &quot;On the Dignity and Vocation of Women&quot;. In section 30 of this letter, John Paul II identified women as having a &quot;genius that belongs&quot; to them and called on them to use it to restore &quot;sensitivity for human beings in every circumstance. Women are mothers and caregivers as well as participants in every realm of human endeavor. He describes the &#x27;feminine genius&#x27; as including empathy, interpersonal relations, emotive capacity, subjectivity, communication, intuition and personalization. In the controversial section 24 of this letter, John Paul II defends the equality of women and argues that husbands and wives are to be mutually submissive to each other.

John Paul II had begun his theologically-based affirmation of integral gender complementarity in his Wednesday audiences between 1979 and 1984, in what is now compiled as the Theology of the Body. In this work, he describes his belief that men and women are formed as complementary human beings for the sake of loving and being loved.

John Paul II continued his call for women to become advocates of humanity in his &quot;Apostolic Letter to Women&quot; prior to the 1995 Beijing Women&#x27;s conference.

Since then, women interested in advocating for the person--along with their male collaborators--have been developing personalist feminism. &quot;Personalist feminism&quot; was a term first coined by Prudence Allen to describe the feminism called for by John Paul II. Women have also been developing new feminism as a philosophical theory about sexual complementarity. They agree that being the equal to men in their professional and social capacities does not require denying their physical differences as women nor the importance of being a mother whether physically or spiritually.

== Theory ==

=== Integral sex complementarity ===

While the Greeks acknowledged the possibility of sex complementarity, systematic developments into this philosophy of the person did not begin until Augustine of Hippo, who recognized the implications of the Christian doctrine of the resurrection. The first western philosopher to articulate a complete theory of sex complementarity was Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th-century Benedictine nun. Her advances were soon buried by the 13th century Aristotelian Revolution, and the lack of higher education for women in the following centuries.

Philosophical developments in the concept of integral gender complementarity were popularized in the early 20th century by two students of Edmund Husserl: Dietrich von Hildebrand and Edith Stein. Von Hildebrand argued against the &quot;terrible anti-personalism&quot; of his age, stating that it is the &quot;general dissimilarity in the nature of both which enables... a real complementary relationship&quot;. Stein revived the metaphysics of Thomas Aquinas to argue that a difference in bodies constitutes a difference in spirit, that the soul is not unisex. Stein&#x27;s argument has been criticized for not realizing that the immateriality of the human soul transcends the limitations of the body as Aquinas argues. New feminist theories were also influenced by the Personalist and Phenomenology movements of the early 20th century.

Integral complementarity differs from fractional complementarity, in that it argues that men and women are each whole persons in and of themselves, and, together, equal more than the sum of their parts. The concept of fractional complementarity argues that a man and woman each make up a part of a person. By this theory, when they are joined together, they then comprise one, composite being.

=== Meaning of the body ===
New feminists promote an understanding of the human person as one who is made in the image and likeness of God (&quot;imago Dei&quot;) for the purpose of union and communion. They see distinct differences in the ways in which men and women make a sincere gift of themselves through the &#x27;nuptial meaning of the body&#x27;, and see these gifts as shedding light on the mysteries of God and their own vocation, mission and dignity.

Other ideas promoted by new feminists include:
* that the different bodily structures of men and women lead both to different lived experiences.
* that the different ways in which men and women give life physically are linked to emotional, spiritual, and intellectual dispositions.
* that fulfillment as a woman means exercising maternal care, whether physically or spiritually. New feminists believe that whether or not they do it well, women are physically structured to be mothers, to develop life with their wombs. They purport the idea that the physical capacity for motherhood connects with the psychological, spiritual and emotional characteristics that women would need to be mothers.
* that regardless of whether or not a woman ever gives birth, she has the capacity for maternal love in spiritual motherhood.

==== The feminine genius ====
The phrase &quot;the feminine genius&quot; is used to describe the genius that John Paul II identified as belonging to women, “which can ensure sensitivity for human beings in every circumstance.” He argues that this sensitivity is linked to maternity. Work on unpacking the nature of this link can be found in various anthologies, such as &quot;Women in Christ: Toward a New Feminism&quot; (2004) and &quot;Woman as Prophet in the Home and the World&quot; (2016). The characteristics of these feminine genius-maternity links raise many open questions. For example:

; Emphasis on the person: Because they can receive and develop life within their wombs, women can have a special openness to the new person - their child. This includes the capacity to unify all of humankind because people were all once united with their mothers in their wombs. The open questions here include the degree to which it takes a decision to consider every human person as some one&#x27;s child and the ways in which such a decision has implications for social policy, the arts, and human culture.
; Empathy: Because of the need to care for their developing children, within their wombs and as infants, caring mothers tend to become more empathetic. The open questions on this characteristic include whether the development of empathy is physiological or the result of the choice to be caring. They also include evaluating Edith Stein&#x27;s argument that women have &quot;a profound need to share [their lives] with another and, consequently, a capacity for unselfish love, for commitment, a capacity to transcend the self...&quot;.
; Receptivity: Only women are created with a physical empty space inside of themselves capable of receiving another person and conceiving new life. Through pregnancy, women give a gift of self - their own bodies - so that others, their children, can receive the gift of life. The open questions here include the correlation between sexual receptivity and other kinds of receptivity, e.g. emotional, psychological, spiritual, intellectual and so forth.
; Protection of life: Because of the new human life within their wombs, women have a special vocation to care for their own children and a special sensitivity to the needs of all those who cannot care for themselves - the weak, the poor, the outcast - all those whose life is not valued. New feminists believe it to be a particular injustice when women support abortion, infanticide, embryonic stem cell research, or in-vitro fertilization. The open questions here concern the best ways to meet the needs of women and offer the support necessary to end these injustices and build a more humane society. Personalist feminists argue that the collaboration of men is so necessary for these tasks that they too need to be feminists.
; Sanctity and modesty: Women have a sense of modesty to guard against the exploitation or objectification of that holy mystery. Only total love - unconditional commitment and mutual self-giving in marriage - &quot;has the capacity to absorb the shame of human nature.&quot; The key to this absorption is valuing sexuality as the embodiment of a person who is dearly loved. New feminists are typically against what Russell D. Moore termed &quot;the Concubine Culture&quot; of couples living together and having sex outside of marriage.
; Supportive of men: By enabling men to become fathers, women give men a great gift. While he shares in parenthood, man always remains outside the process of pregnancy and birth. In many ways, women facilitate a man&#x27;s fatherhood and parenting skills. For New feminists, the fulfillment of masculinity means being a father, whether physically or spiritually. In order to become a physical father, a man must give away his semen, in order to create new life. All spiritual fathers, according to New Feminists, have a responsibility to protect the mutual self-giving of man and woman. This sense of protection of their wives and families is also built into a man&#x27;s physical capacities in the greater physical strength of men, generally speaking, as well as their psychological need to feel competent and capable. There are many unresolved questions here include the ways in which women facilitate fatherhood, substantiating the claim that fatherhood is key to male fulfillment, and the ways in which fatherhood is imaged in the Trinity and by Christ. 
:There is controversy as not all new feminists accept John Paul II&#x27;s argument in sections 23-24 of Mulieris Dignitatem that due to Genesis 1:27 and Ephesians 5:21, husband and wives are to be mutually submissive. For example, in Eastern Orthodoxy, spiritual fatherhood means spiritual priesthood – the offering of a man&#x27;s body and blood for the sanctification of the world. It was because Jesus gave his body and blood away both as a sacrifice for his Church and as a gift to the Church in the form of the Eucharist that new spiritual life could be conceived. &quot;A man is &#x27;head&#x27; of his wife not to stroke his own ego, but in order to give up his body for her&quot; and thus create new life. As keepers of the Eucharist, men are entrusted with the body and blood of Christ. All men, whether single or married, are entrusted with woman – the body of the Church. &quot;She is their Eucharist.&quot;

==== New feminist positions ====
; Distinction, not discrimination: &quot;Discrimination is an evil, but distinction is God&#x27;s design.&quot; New feminists claim that men and women are different and that this difference affects the way they live their lives, what they care about, and their strengths and weaknesses. Women can fulfill their vocational calling by acting as spiritual mothers in whatever their occupation: as wife, mother, consecrated woman, working professional, or single woman. Differences between the sexes should never be used to unilaterally discriminate except in cases when a task is contingent upon a person being of a certain sex, e.g., women give birth and only men can be priests in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.
; Marriage as communion: New feminists consider marriage to be a reciprocal self-giving of persons in free, total, faithful and fruitful communion. This means that marriage is more than a &quot;partnership&quot;; it is a communion of persons.
; Celebration of the family and the home: New feminists argue that a true feminism is not just about women, it is about the Family – both individually and collectively in the Church and Humanity. The family is the foundational unit of society, yet many women do not have the choice to stay at home with their children because of social, economic or political pressures. Women&#x27;s work as mothers and in the home must be valued as good in and of itself.
; Love and service, not power, domination or bitterness: Dismayed by what they see as the bitterness, hatred, or retribution of many feminists against men or other women for current or past injustices, new feminists argue that men and women should cooperate with one another in interpersonal communion. This means giving of themselves in mutual service and love. 
; True freedom remembers purpose, including oughts as well as rights: In order for men and women to be truly free, new feminists assert that they must honor the Creator and love accordingly. Philosophy and Religion, then, are essential components in the search for how men and women &quot;should&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; to act for &quot;a higher truth or good&quot;, not just how they want or can act. New feminists assert that people must gratefully remember God loves them as shown by creation; they must recognize that life, in some way, is a gift and not a mere thing which a person can claim as his or her exclusive property.
; Fruitfulness, not just productivity: To be fruitful is to enable others to love and be loved. While productivity is valuable, helpful and necessary, it must be geared towards respect and love for the person – even though it takes longer, requires patience and the cooperation of others, and is appreciated not measured. Every act of service is a witness to the worth of the human person and thus promotes the progress of the whole human race.
; Fertility, not sterility: Many new feminists assert that fertility is a natural, healthy biological process, not a disease that women need to take the Pill to be cured from. If women respect their fertility – their potential for physical and spiritual motherhood, they demand respect from others and deny that their sexuality is reducible to self-gratification. This devaluing of sexuality occurs with the use of contraceptives. Thus, the vast majority of new feminists discuss the spiritual, emotional, and physical benefits for men and women by following natural family planning instead of utilizing contraception.

=== Proponents ===
Contemporary proponents include Pia de Solenni, Janet E. Smith, Katrina Zeno, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, R. Mary Lemmons, Colleen Carroll Campbell, Mary Beth Bonacci, Sister Prudence Allen, Alice von Hildebrand, Kimberly Hahn, Helen Alvare, Dorinda C. Bordlee, Erika Bachiochi, and Mary Ellen Bork. The work of earlier Catholic thinkers on masculinity and femininity, such as Hildegard of Bingen, Edith Stein and G. E. M. Anscombe, has also become recently influential in the development of new feminism. Though primarily originally in the thought of John Paul II, the movement also includes prominent non-Catholics, like Jewish author Wendy Shalit and Protestant activist Enola Aird.

== Critiques ==
Critics of the movement argue that it was created by a patriarchal structure for its own maintenance. As commented by Sister of Mercy Mary Aquin O&#x27;Neill, director of the Mount Agnes Theological Center for Women in Baltimore, &quot;[i]t will always mean that men are defining women and telling women what it is like to be a woman.&quot; According to this view, until women are members of this higher authority, they can never make authoritative decisions about their perspectives because they are excluded from the vote. Those critics maintain that no movement that opposes abortion and birth control in the form of artificial contraception can be positive for women, and that new feminism is a form of gender or biological determinism, which may be seen as old prejudices in a new guise.

This modern use of new feminism by the Catholic Church attempts to stray away from the traditional sentiments of the 1912 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; that women and men do not belong together in the political, economic, and social spheres. It was never clarified as to why these changes were made, and the Holy See still followed many premises that shared the same anthropological arguments of the 1912 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. Another critique of new feminism is that Pope John Paul II&#x27;s positions can too easily be tied to more traditional Catholic teachings. This could cause the continuation of a worldview that negates the ability for men and women to successfully work together in a professional and/or social setting.

<text>Rodrigo Prieto Stambaugh, [[American Society of Cinematographers|ASC]], AMC (born November 23, 1965), is a Mexican cinematographer and film director.

He has collaborated with Martin Scorsese and Alejandro González Iñárritu, among other prominent directors. He is a member of both the Mexican Society of Cinematographers and the American Society of Cinematographers. Throughout his career, Prieto has received many awards and nominations, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005) and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Silence&quot; (2016), &quot;The Irishman&quot; (2019), and &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; (2023).

==Early life and education ==
Rodrigo Prieto was born in Mexico City, Mexico. His grandfather, Jorge Prieto Laurens, was the mayor of Mexico City and leader of the Chamber of Deputies of Mexico, but was later persecuted by the country&#x27;s ruler because of political differences. Prieto&#x27;s grandfather escaped with his family to Texas and then to Los Angeles, where Prieto&#x27;s father would spend most of his childhood. Prieto&#x27;s father studied aeronautical engineering at New York University, where he met and married Prieto&#x27;s mother, an artist. Rodrigo Prieto graduated from Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica in Mexico City. 

== Career ==

Prieto is noted for his unconventional use of the camera often combined with strong moody lighting. In &quot;25th Hour&quot;, Prieto utilized overexposure and other techniques to create original dream-like images to signify that the events shown on screen are memories or visions. Similarly innovative photography could be spotted in &quot;Frida&quot;, featuring strong colors and sharp imagery blended with atmospheric yellows and browns, as well as his experimental use of infrared during a battle scene in &quot;Alexander&quot;. Prieto also is interested in evoking naturalism, most evident in &quot;The Homesman&quot; and &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. Prieto not only shot &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, but appeared in a cameo role within the film as a Mexican gigolo whom Jake Gyllenhaal&#x27;s character, Jack Twist, meets.

Prieto has formed an artistic collaboration with Martin Scorsese on his films &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Silence&quot;, &quot;The Irishman&quot;, and &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;. He garnered Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography for the latter three. He served as cinematographer for the music videos for the three Taylor Swift 2020 singles, &quot;The Man&quot;, which references one of his previous films &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Cardigan&quot; and &quot;Willow&quot;.

Prieto is the recipient of the 2021 Vilcek Prize in Filmmaking, awarded by the Vilcek Foundation.

In October 2023, Prieto served as a juror at the Morelia International Film Festival in Michoacán, Mexico.

==Personal life==
Prieto resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife Monica and they have two daughters.

<text>John Lee Mahin (August 23, 1902, Evanston, Illinois – April 18, 1984, Los Angeles) was an American screenwriter and producer of films who was active in Hollywood from the 1930s to the 1960s. He was known as the favorite writer of Clark Gable and Victor Fleming. In the words of one profile, he had &quot;a flair for rousing adventure material, and at the same time he wrote some of the raciest and most sophisticated sexual comedies of that period.&quot;

==Biography==
Mahin was born in Winnetka, Illinois in 1902, the son of John Lee Mahin, Sr. (1869–1930), a Chicago newspaper and advertising man, and Julia Graham Snitzler.

Mahin attended Harvard University; while there he reviewed movies and plays for the Boston &quot;American&quot; at $30 a week. Mahin worked as a journalist for two years in New York, at the &quot;Sun&quot;, the &quot;Post&quot; and the &quot;City News&quot;. He then tried to make a living as an actor, starting as a chorus boy in a production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Patience&quot; at the Province Playhouse. He eventually moved into advertising in New York but wrote fiction on the side.

Mahin became friendly with Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, who he would meet on the ferry while commuting to work in New York. Hecht read Mahin&#x27;s stories and encouraged him to move to Hollywood.

===Early screenwriting===
Hecht and MacArthur were working on &quot;The Unholy Garden&quot; (1931) for Sam Goldwyn and brought in Mahin to help at $200 a week. They liked his work and when Hecht went on to the gangster movie &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932), he took Mahin with him. Mahin wrote the script in collaboration with Hecht, Seton I. Miller and the director Howard Hawks (W. R. Burnett had done an earlier draft).

===World War II===
Mahin served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Forces with Clark Gable.

===MGM===
It took a while for &quot;Scarface&quot; to be released but advance word was strong and MGM offered Mahin a long-term contract at $200 a week. They assigned him to a gangster film, &quot;Beast of the City&quot; (1932) which starred Jean Harlow. While working on Howard Hawks asked him to do some uncredited work on &quot;Tiger Shark&quot; (1932) at Warner Bros; Mahin did it in the evenings.

Mahin wrote &quot;The Wet Parade&quot; (1932) his first movie with director Victor Fleming. The two men had a huge hit with &quot;Red Dust&quot; (1932), which helped make a star out of Clark Gable.

Mahin did some work on &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot; (1933), then &quot;Hell Below&quot; (1933) (in which he also appeared as an actor), &quot;Bombshell&quot; (1933) for Fleming, &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot; (1933) and &quot;Eskimo&quot; (1933); Mahin claims to have done some directing on the latter.

Other credits included &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; (1934), &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934) for Fleming, and &quot;Chained&quot; (1934). He adapted the operetta &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1935) and did uncredited work on &quot;China Seas&quot; (1935).

Mahin then wrote &quot;Riffraff&quot; (1936), &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot; (1936), &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1936), &quot;The Devil Is a Sissy&quot; (1936), and &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1936).

He was Oscar nominated for his work on &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937) for Fleming. Mahin wrote &quot;The Last Gangster&quot; (1937), then did two Gable films, &quot;Test Pilot&quot; (1938), and &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; (1938). In 1937 MGM paid him $56,000.

With Fleming, Mahin did uncredited work on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) and worked for about a week on &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939).

Mahin did another for Gable, &quot;Boom Town&quot; (1940) and was reunited with Fleming on &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1941). In July 1940 it was reported MGM had paid him $80,833 for the previous year.

He did a gangster film for Mervyn LeRoy, &quot;Johnny Eager&quot; (1941) and some uncredited work on the ending of &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942).

Mahin adapted &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (1943) and worked on the British film &quot;The Adventures of Tartu&quot; (1943).

While serving during World War II, Mahin wrote &quot;Combat America&quot; (1943), narrated by Gable.

After the war, Mahin did uncredited work on &quot;Adventure&quot; (1945) for Gable and Fleming, &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot; (1947). He wrote &quot;The Risen Soldier&quot;, a biopic of Cardinal Spellman to star Van Johnson that was not used.

===20th Century Fox===
Over at 20th Century Fox he did &quot;That Wonderful Urge&quot; (1948), &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot; (1949), &quot;Love That Brute&quot; (1950) and &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; (1950).

===Louis B Mayer===
When Louis B. Mayer left MGM, Mahin went with him. Mayer put Mahin under personal contract, and would loan him out to studios, including MGM.

Mahin wrote the screenplay for &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951), the Technicolor remake of the noted 1927 stage musical, which had previously been filmed in 1936. According to musical theatre historian Miles Kreuger in his book, &quot;Show Boat: The History of a Classic American Musical&quot;, Mahin retained most of the basic structure of the storyline, but little of Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s stage dialogue, preferring to create his own. According to Kreuger, Mahin and producer Arthur Freed introduced the plot device of keeping the lovers Magnolia Hawks and Gaylord Ravenal young to the end, rather than having a passage that showed them forty years older, as in the original stage musical.

He wrote &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951) for MGM and &quot;My Son John&quot; (1952) for Leo McCarey. He redid his &quot;Red Dust&quot; script as &quot;Mogambo&quot; (1953) for Gable and John Ford, and worked on another melodrama in the tropics, &quot;Elephant Walk&quot; (1954).

In 1955 a play he wrote with Patsy Ruth Miller, &quot;Don Ella&quot;, played at UCLA.

Mahin wrote &quot;Lucy Gallant&quot; (1955), &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; (1956) for LeRoy, &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; (1957) for John Huston, and &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (1958) for LeRoy. &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr Allison&quot; earned him another Oscar nomination.

Mahin adapted &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; for Mayer but plans to film it were dropped when Mayer died. (It would be filmed in 1969 with a fresh script.) Mahin did do some uncredited work on the Cinerama film, &quot;South Seas Adventure&quot; (1958).

===Producer===
Mahin got to know Martin Rackin when they worked on a script of Pearl Buck&#x27;s &quot;Letter from Peking&quot;, that was never filmed. They decided to form a production company. Together they wrote and produced &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; (1959), &quot;Revak the Rebel&quot; (1959) and &quot;North to Alaska&quot; (1960). The association ended when Rackin was appointed head of Paramount.

===Later career===
Mahin&#x27;s later credits included &quot;The Spiral Road&quot; (1962) and &quot;Moment to Moment&quot; (1966) for LeRoy. He also wrote episodes of &quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot; (1971–72).

==Politics==
Mahin was a founder of the Screen Writers Guild in 1933. In the late 1930s, he became president of a rival organization, the Screen Playwrights Guild. He rejoined the Guild in 1948 and became its president.

==Accolades==
He won the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement in 1958.

==Personal life==
His second marriage was to silent film actress Patsy Ruth Miller from 1937 until their divorce in 1946. They had one child, Timothy Miller Mahin.

<text>Ruth Suzanne Dyson (born 11 August 1957) is a former New Zealand politician. She was a Labour Party Member of Parliament from 1993 to 2020. She represented the electorate from the election to 2020. She also held a number of senior offices in the Labour Party, including president.

==Early life and career==
Dyson was born in Lower Hutt in 1957. Her father served in the New Zealand Army, and so Dyson&#x27;s family frequently moved around the country. Dyson joined the Labour Party in Westport in 1979, and worked as a campaign organiser for West Coast Labour MP Kerry Burke in the 1981 and 1984 election campaigns. In 1985, she moved to Wellington, where she worked with Labour MP Fran Wilde on the Homosexual Law Reform Bill before taking up a position as an advisor to Burke in the office of the Minister of Employment in 1986. She worked as an organiser for Wilde&#x27;s re-election campaign in Wellington Central for the 1987 election. Dyson was then employed as an executive officer at Wellington Regional Employment and ACCESS Control.

She held several senior positions in the Labour Party hierarchy. In 1984 she was elected the women&#x27;s representative on Labour&#x27;s New Zealand Council before becoming a member of the party executive in 1986. She was the elected vice president of the party at the 1987 Labour conference. At the 1988 conference in Dunedin Dyson won a highly contested campaign to win the party president from former president and maverick MP Jim Anderton by 99 votes (575 to 473). After the defeat of the controversial Fourth Labour Government Dyson was self-employed as a training and employment consultant from 1990 to 1993.

In the lead up to the Dyson stood for the Labour nomination in the Christchurch seat of Lyttelton. She beat 5 other local aspirants for the nomination and pledged to move from Wellington into the electorate before the election.

==Member of Parliament==



Dyson first entered Parliament in the , winning the electorate against National&#x27;s David Carter. In the , the Lyttelton electorate was abolished, and Dyson stood in , losing to Carter, who had in the meantime become an MP through winning the 1994 Selwyn by-election. She became a list MP owing to her position on the Labour Party&#x27;s list. After the 1996 election Dyson was appointed Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for ACC and Disability Services by leader Helen Clark. In the she in turn defeated Carter to win Banks Peninsula. She has remained the MP for the area (later renamed Port Hills) since that time, holding the seat until her retirement in 2020.

Dyson was a senior member of the Labour Party during the Helen Clark-led Fifth Labour Government, serving in a range of health and employment-related portfolios including Minister for Disability Issues (1999–2000; 2001–2008), Minister for ACC (2002–2007), Minister of Labour (2005–2007) and Minister for Social Development and Employment (2007–2008).

=== Fifth Labour Government, 1999–2008 ===
When the Labour Party won power in the 1999 general election, Dyson was appointed to a number of minor ministerial roles, including Disability Issues and Associate Health and Associate Social Development. However, she resigned them on 31 October 2000 after being caught drink driving. She regained most of her ministerial responsibilities on 4 June 2001. She acknowledged after her resignation that she had been convicted and fined for possession of cannabis when she was a teenager stating &quot;I find it sickening that some 25 years later someone has anonymously passed this information to journalists.&quot;

As Minister for Disability Issues, she led the development of what would become the New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006, which gave New Zealand Sign Language the status of an official language of New Zealand. In her valedictory statement in 2020, Dyson reflected on the Act: &quot;I regret that it wasn&#x27;t more prescriptive in its implementation, because its roll-out has been slower than it could have been. That should be fixed.&quot;

In a reshuffle on 31 October 2007, Dyson was promoted to Minister for Social Development, which she held until the Clark government lost power at the 2008 general election. Despite the swing against Labour at that election, Dyson won the new Port Hills electorate with an increased margin.

=== Opposition, 2008–2017 ===
The National Party won the 2008 election, putting Labour in Opposition where it would remain for the next nine years. During this time Dyson held a range of portfolios, including health (2008–2011), internal affairs (2011–2013), conservation and disability issues (2013–2015), Canterbury Earthquake Recovery (2013–2014) and senior citizens (2013–2017). She was also deputy chair of the Health select committee (2008–2011) and chair of the Government Administration select committee (2011–2017).

In December 2009 Dyson&#x27;s Resource Management (Requiring Authorities) Amendment Bill, which would amend the Resource Management Act 1991 to reintroduce a public interest test for projects seeking requiring authority, was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill was defeated at its first reading.

Dyson was criticised in December 2015 for describing National&#x27;s Speaker David Carter as &quot;incompetent, biased... lazy [and] sexist&quot; on Twitter.

=== Sixth Labour Government 2017–2020 and retirement ===
Dyson had been positioned to be Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives (to Trevor Mallard) if Labour won the 2017 general election. While Labour was able to form a Government (in coalition with New Zealand First), the National Party&#x27;s Anne Tolley was appointed as Deputy Speaker instead. Dyson was put in the role of Labour&#x27;s Senior Whip. However, when the Assistant Speaker Poto Williams was appointed as a Minister outside Cabinet in July 2019, Dyson was named as her replacement.

Dyson was also chair of the Abortion Legislation Committee (a special select committee that examined the Abortion Legislation Bill) and a member of the Epidemic Response Committee (which considered the government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic).

In March 2019, Dyson indicated that she would not seek re-election at the 2020 general election. While the Port Hills electorate was disestablished for that election, Labour&#x27;s candidate for the replacement electorate of Banks Peninsula was Tracey McLellan.

In the 2021 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Dyson was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order, for services as a member of Parliament and to people with disabilities.

In March 2023, Dyson was accused of not being politically impartial in her roles as deputy chair of the Earthquake Commission and Fire and Emergency New Zealand as is the expectation of public servants and government-appointed board members. She admitted to not having read the code of conduct governing her position as a Crown entity board member. She said &quot;I&#x27;m prepared to review all my social media engagement and reflect on whether it meets the standard. I haven&#x27;t done that yet,&quot; She had written on Twitter &quot;Oh no. It sounds like some cruel junior staffer gave Mr Luxon the wrong speech! #Waitangi2023,&quot; Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said &quot;I would certainly expect her to be reading it [Code of Conduct] ... my understanding is she has subsequently been in touch with the relevant minister&#x27;s office to indicate she will read the code of conduct and she will follow it&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Ramsay&quot; (DD-124) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, reclassified as DM-16 during World War II and again reclassified as AG-98. She was the first ship named for Rear Admiral Francis Ramsay.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Ramsay&quot; was laid down on 21 December 1917 by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia. The ship was launched on 8 June 1918, sponsored by Miss Mary Virginia Ramsay, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Ramsay. The destroyer was commissioned on 15 February 1919.

==Service history==
Assigned to Division 12, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Ramsay&quot; completed shakedown training off Cuba in March, participated in fleet maneuvers in early April, and then sailed for New York City. She got underway in May for the Azores to act as a guide and weather observer for the NC transatlantic flights. Steaming between the Azores and Portugal from 16 May to 25 May, she returned to the United States on 6 June. For the next month she conducted tactical exercises along the East Coast and, on 6 July, put into Norfolk to prepare for transfer to the Pacific.

&quot;Ramsay&quot; arrived at San Diego on 7 August and, after at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, commenced two years of operations with Destroyer Force, Pacific. On 17 July 1920 she was designated DD-124. In early 1922, she prepared for inactivation and, on 30 June 1922, she was decommissioned and berthed at San Diego as a unit of the Reserve Fleet. Recommissioned eight years later, on 2 June 1930, she was reclassified as a light minelayer, redesignated DM-16 on 13 June, and homeported at Pearl Harbor. Converted at the Navy Yard there, she operated with Minecraft, Battle Force, primarily in the Hawaiian area until 1937 when she returned to San Diego for her second inactivation and was decommissioned on 14 December 1937. Recommissioned on 25 September 1939, she joined MinDiv 5, Minecraft, Battle Force, and for the next year conducted patrols engaged in gunnery drills and landing exercises, and trained naval reservists along the Pacific coast.

===World War II===
On 10 December 1940, &quot;Ramsay&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor and, throughout the next year, operated with Mine Divisions 5 and 2. Moored at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941, she fired her guns in combat for the first time at carrier-based planes delivering Japan&#x27;s declaration of war on the United States.

Underway from the harbor before 0900, for offshore patrol, &quot;Ramsay&quot; made sound contact with a submarine at 1120. She released ten depth charges, and then watched an oil slick spread over the attack area. She had damaged, and possibly had sunk one of the midget submarines used by the Japanese in the attack. Eight days later, while escorting a merchant ship off Kauai, she made her second contact. During two runs over the enemy, she dropped her depth charges and again was rewarded by the appearance of an oil slick on the surface indicating damage to her quarry.

Into February 1942, &quot;Ramsay&quot; continued patrol escort services in the Hawaiian area. On 22 February, she got underway with TF 19 for Samoa. Arriving Pago Pago on 4 March, she planted defensive minefields off Tutuila and Apia, then shifted to Suva for mining activities among the Fiji Islands. On 3 May she steamed out of Suva for the New Hebrides and by 11 June had completed, with , the Efate defensive minefields. The next day, she cleared Vila harbor, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 July.

For the next two months, she again performed escort and patrol assignments in the Hawaiian Islands. Then, on 14 September, she sailed for the Aleutians. Still with &quot;Montgomery&quot;, she arrived at Adak on 22 September and three days later resumed mineplanting activities. In November she returned to California; underwent overhaul at Hunters Point; and on 13 January 1943 arrived back in the Aleutians for nine months of escort and patrol duty from Unalaska in the east to Attu in the west.

On 17 September, &quot;Ramsay&quot; sailed south. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she put into San Francisco on 4 October for another overhaul. Out of the shipyard by 20 December, she sailed west on 24 December. She joined ServRon 6 at Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1944, and on 21 January headed for the Gilberts. After a brief stop at Tarawa, she rendezvoused with TG 50.15 on 30 January and screened the cruiser during the bombardment of Wotje that afternoon. The next day, she guarded the cruiser during shelling, and, on 2 February, she arrived at Majuro, where she conducted antisubmarine patrols until 14 March. An escort run to the Gilberts followed, and on 19 February she got underway to return to Pearl Harbor. Arriving on 27 February, she was assigned convoy escort duty. Between then and mid-September, she shepherded ships to Majuro, San Francisco and Eniwetok. In October, she served with the Submarine Training Force and, in November, returned to the Marshalls for escort and training duty off Majuro.

With the new year, 1945, &quot;Ramsay&quot; headed east and during February again worked with the Submarine Training Force. At the end of the month, she sailed for San Pedro, where, after overhaul, she was designated a miscellaneous auxiliary and was reclassified AG-98, effective 5 June. On 15 June, she once more got underway for Pearl Harbor, and for the next three months, she served as plane guard for aircraft carriers training in Hawaiian waters. On 24 September, she arrived back at San Pedro to await her third, and final, inactivation. She was decommissioned on 19 October 1945, struck from the Navy list on 13 November 1945; and sold for scrapping on 21 November 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Ramsay&quot; earned three battle stars during World War II.

<doc id="1070206" wikidata="Q1193243" url="?curid=1070206" title="John Houghton (physicist)">
<text>Sir John Theodore Houghton (30 December 1931 – 15 April 2020) was a Welsh atmospheric physicist who was the co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#x27;s (IPCC) scientific assessment working group which shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 with Al Gore. He was lead editor of the first three IPCC reports. He was professor in atmospheric physics at the University of Oxford, former Director General at the Met Office and founder of the Hadley Centre.

He was the president of the John Ray Initiative, an organisation &quot;connecting Environment, Science and Christianity&quot;, where he has compared the stewardship of the Earth, to the stewardship of the Garden of Eden by Adam and Eve. He was a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion. He became the president of the Victoria Institute in 2005.

==Biography==
Born in Dyserth, John Theodore Houghton was the second of the three sons of Sidney and Miriam (née Yarwood) Houghton. His older brother, David (died 2015), became a meteorologist. The third and youngest brother, Paul Houghton, became a lecturer in engineering and was treasurer and company chairman of the John Ray Initiative, connecting the environment, science and Christianity.

The family moved to Rhyl when John was two, and he attended Rhyl Grammar School where he discovered his interest in science. He continued his education at Jesus College, Oxford, gaining a BA in 1951, MA (Oxon) and DPhil in 1955. 

He was brought up as an evangelical Christian by devout Christian parents and believed in science and Christianity as strengthening each other, as well as Christianity and environmentalism. Houghton&#x27;s evangelical Christianity combined with his scientific background made him a significant voice in evangelical Christian circles. He was a supporter of and advisor to the international Christian relief and development agency Tearfund. He was also an elder at Aberdovey Presbyterian Church. 

In 1962, Houghton married Dr Margaret Broughton, daughter of a mill owner in Colwyn, Lancashire, and they had two children and seven grandchildren. Following her death from cancer in 1986, he set up the Margaret Houghton Memorial Fund, a research unit on medical nursing in her memory. He married his second wife, Sheila Thompson, in 1988.

Posts include:
* a Member of the UK Government Panel on Sustainable Development (1994–2000)
* Chairman, Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (1992–98)
* Chairman or Co-Chairman, Scientific Assessment Working Group, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (1988–2002)
* Director General (later Chief Executive), UK Meteorological Office (1983–91)
* Director Appleton, Science and Engineering Research Council (also Deputy Director, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory)(1979–83)
* Professor of Atmospheric Physics, Oxford University (1973–83).

He was knighted in 1991. Houghton was an Honorary Scientist of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research at the Met Office (since 2002); Honorary Scientist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (since 1991); a Trustee of the Shell Foundation (since 2000); Chairman of the John Ray Initiative (since 1997) and in 2013 was announced as an Advisory Board member for Sure Chill Technology. He moved back to Wales and lived in Aberdyfi. In 2007 he criticised the controversial documentary &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot; for its inaccuracies.

He died of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and COVID-19 in hospital at Dolgellau on 15 April 2020, aged 88.

==Misquotation==
In a November 2006 article in Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, journalist Piers Akerman quoted Houghton as saying &quot;Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen&quot;, attributing the quotation to his 1994 book &quot;Global Warming, The Complete Briefing&quot;. This has since been quoted by many deniers, including Benny Peiser and Christopher Monckton, and is listed at the top of the front page of Christopher Booker&#x27;s &quot;The Real Global Warming Disaster&quot;. However, the quotation does not appear in any edition of Houghton&#x27;s book. Houghton never said any such thing and believed the opposite.
The publishers of &quot;The Real Global Warming Disaster&quot;, The Continuum International Publishing Group, apologised for the reference to that quotation, confirmed (in addition to Booker&#x27;s confirmation) that it will not be repeated, and agreed to place a corrigendum in any further copies of the book.

In an article which appeared in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; on 20 February 2010, Christopher Booker purported to correct the misquotation contained in &quot;The Real Global Warming Disaster&quot; but this article contained yet further inaccuracies. As a result, Houghton referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC Reference 101959). Following the PCC&#x27;s involvement, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; published on 15 August 2010 a letter of correction by Houghton stating his true position. An article supportive of Houghton also appeared in the edition of 21 May 2010 of &quot;New Scientist&quot;.

The correct quotation was, &quot;If we want a good environmental policy in the future we&#x27;ll have to have a disaster. It&#x27;s like safety on public transport. The only way humans will act is if there&#x27;s been an accident.&quot;

<doc id="1070207" wikidata="Q1454317" url="?curid=1070207" title="Project team">
<text>In a project, a project team or team is defined as &quot;an interdependent collection of individuals who work together towards a common goal and who share responsibility for specific outcomes of their organizations&quot;. An additional requirement to the original definition is that &quot;the team is identified as such by those within and outside of the team&quot;. As project teams work on specific projects, the first requirement is usually met. In the early stages of a project, the project team may not be recognized as a team, leading to some confusion within the organization. The central characteristic of project teams in modern organizations is the autonomy and flexibility availed in the process or method undertaken to meet their goals.

Most project teams require involvement from more than one department, therefore most project teams can be classified as cross-functional teams. The project team usually consists of a variety of members often working under the direction of a project manager or of a senior member of the organization. Projects that may not receive strong support initially often have the backing of a project champion. Individual team-members can either be involved on a part-time or full-time basis. Their time commitment can change throughout the project depending on the project development stage.

Project teams need to have the right combination of skills, abilities and personality types to achieve collaborative tension. Teams can be formulated in a variety of ways. The most common method is at the discretion of a senior member of the organization.

There are many components to becoming a top-performing team, but the key is working on highly cooperative relationship. The job of management is to foster a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere where members can be themselves and are engaged and invested in the project work. All team members are encouraged for relationship building. Each member is responsible to give constructive feedback, recognize, value and utilize unique strengths of each other. The whole team is tuned trust and cooperation.

<doc id="1070208" wikidata="Q5248210" url="?curid=1070208" title="Deborah Coddington">
<text>Deborah Leslie Coddington is a New Zealand journalist and former ACT New Zealand politician.

==Pre-political career==
Coddington, born in Waipukurau, worked from 1973 to 1984 as a magazine journalist, but in 1985 moved to Russell, a town in the Bay of Islands, where she owned and operated a café and restaurant. In 1989, she returned to journalism, writing for the &quot;Metro&quot; and &quot;North &amp; South&quot; magazines. In 1993, she became a broadcaster, working for the BBC World Service&#x27;s New Zealand operation. She then returned to magazines, becoming senior feature writer for &quot;North &amp; South&quot;. In 2002, she won the Qantas Senior Feature Writer of the Year Award for her work.

From 1978 to 2004, her partner was the controversial publisher Alister Taylor, with whom she had three children.

==Entry into politics==
Coddington first became involved in politics in the context of the Libertarianz party, and in the 1996 election and the 1999 election, the Libertarianz ranked her second and third, respectively, on their party list.

At the 1998 local elections she stood for a seat on the Auckland Regional Council in the Auckland Isthmus Ward ward as an Auckland Now ticket candidate, but was not elected.

==Member of Parliament==

Later, however, Coddington transferred her support to the ACT New Zealand party, which ranked her sixth on its party list in the 2002 election, high enough for her to enter Parliament as a list MP.

In Parliament, Coddington was ACT&#x27;s education spokeswoman, in which capacity she promoted &#x27;school choice&#x27; through a program of school vouchers, praising its adoption in &quot;darkest Africa&quot;.

Many New Zealanders know her as the compiler of a register of sex-offenders which aims to publicly identify those convicted of sex-crimes. This register, first published in 1996, generated considerable criticism from those who alleged it breached the rights of criminals named in it. She has also published a registry of convicted child molesters in Australia. Coddington has also had a high amount of media interest in her personal life – early in 2004 journalists widely canvassed the financial problems of Alister Taylor, her partner (and her subsequent split from him), and later the same year, the media reported Coddington&#x27;s distress about attention received from Roger Kerr, the executive director of the New Zealand Business Roundtable. Kerr allegedly chased her drunk, across the grounds of parliament. Coddington described the media&#x27;s portrayal of events as &quot;wildly overblown&quot;.

On 15 April 2005, Coddington announced that she would not seek re-election in 2005. In the announcement, she said that she did not regret entering politics, but said that she was no longer as eager to fight political battles. Coddington attributed her change in perspective primarily to her recent marriage to Wellington lawyer, Colin Carruthers QC.

==Return to journalism==
Coddington returned to journalism, writing for the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; and &quot;North &amp; South&quot;. In 2019, Coddington was a judge for the Voyager Media Awards.

===Controversy===
In November 2006, Coddington published an article, &quot;Asian Angst&quot;, in &quot;North &amp; South&quot; magazine, questioning immigration and referencing the high profile of &quot;Asian&quot; crime, talking of a &quot;gathering crime tide&quot; and an &quot;Asian menace&quot;. Coddington&#x27;s article attempted to justify this language by pointing to a 53% increase in police arrest figures for &quot;Asians&quot; over the last 10 years. However she neglected to mention that the corresponding overall &quot;Asian&quot; population had increased by more than 100% in that time and that the arrest rate among that &quot;Asian&quot; population (which was already very low compared to the general population) had halved. A member of the general population was now four times more likely to be arrested than an &quot;Asian&quot;.

Outraged reaction swiftly followed, and formal complaints to New Zealand Press Council came from the Asia New Zealand Foundation, the head of Journalism at Massey University and a consortium of mostly academics, journalists and ethnic Asian community leaders led by Tze Ming Mok.

The following month, the New Zealand Press Council condemned Coddington&#x27;s article and ordered &quot;North &amp; South&quot; to print an apology.

The Press Council found the language of the article &quot;misleading&quot; and &quot;emotionally loaded&quot;. The Council stated that even though journalists are &quot;entitled to take a strong position on issues they address ... that does not legitimise gratuitous emphasis on dehumanising racial stereotypes and fear-mongering and, of course, the need for accuracy always remains&quot;.

Coddington called the New Zealand Press Council&#x27;s decision &quot;pathetic&quot;.

<doc id="1070215" wikidata="Q547608" url="?curid=1070215" title="Virtual team">
<text>A virtual team (also known as a geographically dispersed team, distributed team, or remote team) usually refers to a group of individuals who work together from different geographic locations and rely on communication technology such as email, instant messaging, and video or voice conferencing services in order to collaborate. The term can also refer to groups or teams that work together asynchronously or across organizational levels. Powell, Piccoli and Ives (2004) define virtual teams as &quot;groups of geographically, organizationally and/or time dispersed workers brought together by information and telecommunication technologies to accomplish one or more organizational tasks.&quot; As documented by Gibson (2020), virtual teams grew in importance and number during 2000-2020, particularly in light of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic which forced many workers to collaborate remotely with each other as they worked from home.

As the proliferation of fiber optic technology has significantly increased the scope of off-site communication,  there has been a tremendous increase in both the use of virtual teams and scholarly attention devoted to understanding how to make virtual teams more effective (see Stanko &amp; Gibson, 2009; Hertel, Geister &amp; Konradt, 2005; and Martins, Gilson &amp; Maaynard, 2004 for reviews). When utilized successfully, virtual teams allow companies to procure the best expertise without geographical restrictions, to integrate information, knowledge, and resources from a broad variety of contexts within the same team, and to acquire and apply knowledge to critical tasks in global firms. According to Hambley, O&#x27;Neil, &amp; Kline (2007), &quot;virtual teams require new ways of working across boundaries through systems, processes, technology, and people, which requires effective leadership.&quot; Such work often involves learning processes such as integrating and sharing different location-specific knowledge and practices, which must work in concert for the multi-unit firm to be aligned. Yet, teams with a high degree of &quot;virtuality&quot; are not without their challenges, and when managed poorly, they often underperform face-to-face (FTF) teams.

In light of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, many industries experienced a rapid and overnight transition to virtual work as a result of &quot;social distancing.&quot; However, some scholars have argued the phrase &quot;social distancing&quot; in reference to the practice of physical distancing between colleagues may have dangerous connotations, potentially increasing prejudice based on age or ethnicity, isolation due to limited options for interpersonal contact, and hopelessness, given the focus on prohibitions rather than solutions. Today, most work teams have become virtual to some degree, though the literature has yet to incorporate the dynamic urgency of the pandemic and the impacts of rapid-fire learning of new technology and communication skills.

== Origins ==
The acceleration of digital technologies has allowed common, even synchronous activities to be distributed across employees at remote locations. These decentralized work arrangements were first named telework in the 1970s, defined as &quot;work carried out in a location remote from the central offices or production facilities, where the worker has no personal contact with coworkers but is able to communicate with them electronically&quot;. Typically, the remote location is the home, though telework centers and remote offices are alternative locations. Since the introduction of home computers in the 1980s and laptops and mobile phones in the 1990s, increasing numbers of office workers have become able to work from different locations. Moreover, the shift from manufacturing to an information economy has expanded the number of jobs amenable to remote work. Telecommuting is referred to as telework, remote work, distributed work, virtual work, flexible work, flexplace, and distance work, among other labels.

Investigations of such flexible work locations began in earnest over 30 years ago (see Ramsower, 1983). Distributed work and telecommuting have become widespread practices, growing steadily in the United States and abroad. A 2002 study by the Gartner Group indicated that more than 60% of professional American employees worked in teams characterized by virtuality, and by 2012, nearly 3.3 million American workers telecommuted for at least half of the time. Globally, an international survey of 254 senior-level executives revealed that staff in two thirds of their global firms were involved in distributed work.

Early research heralded virtual teams as a promising design for integrating firms and taking maximum advantage of innovation-creating capabilities. They were likewise touted as means to permit flexibility in the &quot;where&quot; of tasks, to allow workers to meet household needs, and to enable organizations to adapt work arrangements to changing environments and labor needs. According to Gibson and Gibbs (2006: 453), the term &quot;virtual&quot; represents a wide variety of teams that are at least to some extent geographically dispersed (consisting of members spread across more than one location), mediated by technology (communicating using electronic tools such as e-mail or instant messaging), structurally dynamic (in which change occurs frequently among members, their roles, and relationships to each other), or nationally diverse (consisting of members with more than one national background). Much of the literature has focused on the challenges of virtual teams, while few have identified their assets and benefits, identifying strategies by which to increase team effectiveness and satisfaction. As technological ability and industry contexts are rapidly and continuously changing, virtual work represents a promising avenue of research as an ever-evolving, fundamental shift in how organizations have historically done business.

== Defining Features ==
The four defining features of a virtual team – geographic dispersion, electronic dependence, national diversity, and dynamic structure – have unique effects and should be considered independently. For example, although electronic dependence sometimes coincides with geographic dispersion, this is not always the case; teams in the same office may use e-mail to avoid the trip up to another floor, and teams in different countries may prefer to meet face-to-face infrequently rather than use video calls. As such, there is conceptual agreement that virtuality is a multidimensional higher-order construct. Rather than being dichotomous &quot;on-off&quot; conditions, these four features of virtuality each represent a continuum, and the degree of difference influences the strength of its effects. These four factors will be explored in further detail below. 
Geographic dispersion refers to the degree of physical distance between team colleagues. A team that spans multiple continents is more dispersed than one whose participants are located in the same city, and this degree of dispersion in turn modulates the severity of outcomes.
Electronic dependence refers to the degree of reliance on electronic tools such as e-mail or instant messaging for communications.

National diversity refers to the number of different nationalities represented on the team. Virtual teams may consist of members of a single nationality (e.g. a software team split between the American East and West Coasts, but who all share American nationality or a global team of Germans who work in different countries, but all share German nationality). Colleagues from different nations may bring different cultural values, mindsets, allegiances, and communication styles to the team.

Dynamic structure/membership refers to how often members leave and join the team, and to how stable or changeable members’ roles are. Rather than having stable membership, many virtual teams are short-term and project-based, or involve frequent member turnover.

== Framework for Processes ==

=== Overview ===
According to Gibson and Cohen (2003), the effectiveness of virtual teams is a function of enabling conditions, which are created and supported by managers and leaders, and do not work independently but rather in concert with one another through multiple performance strategies. Multiple design and implementation factors help to create the conditions that support virtual team effectiveness. These factors include organizational context, team design, technology use, team member characteristics, and work and team processes. Virtuality amplifies the challenges faced by teams. As teams become more virtual, they confront greater uncertainty and complexity, increasing the difficulty of the information processing and sensemaking tasks they face. Likewise, the greater the number and depth of differences that need to be managed in virtual teams, the greater the barriers to effectiveness. These teams must be designed, supported, and led effectively to be successful. When they are well supported, virtual teams enable the best talent irrespective of location, capitalize on each organization’s unique competencies, and bring together people from different perspectives and knowledge bases, leading to higher levels of innovation. This orienting framework is explained in more detail below.

=== Enabling Conditions ===
For virtual teams to perform well, three enabling conditions must be established: (1) shared understanding about the team’s goals, tasks, work processes, and member characteristics; (2) integration or coordination across key organizational systems and structures; and (3) mutual trust in the team.

Shared understanding is the degree of cognitive overlap and commonality in beliefs, expectations, and perceptions about a given target. Virtual teams need to develop a shared understanding about their goals, their tasks, how to achieve them, and what each team member brings to the team.

Integration is the process of establishing ways in which the parts can work together to create value, develop products, or deliver services. The parts of the organization represented by virtual team members are likely to be highly differentiated in response to global competitive pressures and uncertain business environments, potentially hindering effective collaboration. Notably, the lower the level of integration, the greater the difficulty of developing shared understanding.

Mutual or collective trust is a shared psychological state that is characterized by an acceptance of vulnerability based on expectations of intentions or behaviors of others within the team. As members are geographically dispersed and often from different backgrounds, experiences, and cultures, trust is difficult to establish in virtual teams. Thus, it is how the team is designed and managed that creates enabling conditions.

=== Design Factors ===
There are a number of structures and systems which critically enable virtual team success. Design of a virtual team involves structuring the interactions; what kind of communication tools are used; how much face-to-face time will be possible, etc. These design factors fall into five categories: context, group structure, technology, people, and process.

First, those structures that comprise the organizational context include education and training, rewards, reviews such as performance evaluation systems, and selection. Second, the virtual team’s structure works to promote task accomplishment through goals, leadership, task design, and social structures. Third, information technology provides the infrastructure for virtual collaboration by allowing teams to communicate and coordinate their work. The challenge here is determining which technologies are appropriate for what tasks and when. Fourth, the people who work in virtual teams should possess certain capabilities to work effectively with others, such as sufficient task related knowledge and skills. Further, team members need to have a tolerance for ambiguity to deal with the unstructured communication that characterizes virtual teamwork. Finally, one’s team and work processes can help or hinder the creation of enabling conditions. This includes the creation of effectives means of communication, decision making, and conflict resolution by leaders and managers.

=== Virtuality and Degree of Differences ===
As explored above, Gibson &amp; Cohen (2003) indicated that the relationship between design factors and enabling conditions is moderated by the degree of virtuality and degree of differences. It follows that the greater the degree of virtuality and degree of differences, the more difficult it will be to establish supportive enabling conditions. The degree of virtuality includes the degree of electronic dependency and geographical dispersion, while the degree of differences includes the degree of variation in culture, language, organization, and function.

=== Outputs ===
The outputs of virtual work include all the things that result from the team’s work processes. These can be organized into two categories: business outcomes and human outcomes. Possible business outcomes are goal achievement, productivity, timeliness, customer satisfaction, organization learning, innovation, and cycle time. Possible human outcomes include team member attitudes such as commitment, satisfaction, and longevity, i.e., the capacity to work together in the future.

Often, these judgments of performance are subjective and depend on the team’s manager or other stakeholders in its social system. Studies have found that effectiveness can increase the greater the virtuality of a team, but only when many of the features in the framework are in place. For example, teams which fostered a shared identity by communicating consistently, developing relationships, and openly acknowledging cultural differences were better able to harness the energy and commitment of members. Such strong team identity may help to allow for constructive controversy which enables the open sharing of views, knowledge and perspective coinciding with members’ identities. As Gibson and co-authors (2020) found, teams with high resilience, tolerance for ambiguity, and strong team identification experienced less intrapersonal identity conflict and therefore thrived more at work. Likewise, formalization processes that help to establish the global team as a source of identity, such as implementing rules and procedures early on and clarifying team boundaries, increase knowledge sharing and thus improve team effectiveness.

Gibson and her colleagues (2021) further found that virtual teams were more effective when they were able to recognize cues indicating when existing technologies had become constraints and strategically change their technology affordances to accommodate shifts in knowledge management activities. Teams which used a &quot;dynamic connection repertoire&quot; to co-evolve their purpose and technology were highly successful, as opposed to teams which failed to shift to different technologies as task needs changed.

Other studies have compared students working in purely virtual teams to purely face-to-face teams and found mixed results. Tan et al. found that teams which used their dialogue technique were more satisfied with decisions made in the team. One study found that a traditional team started out more satisfied than a virtual team. Then, in less than a year, the satisfaction of the virtual team rose and exceeded the satisfaction of the traditional team. Women were more satisfied than men with virtual teams and were also more satisfied compared to women in face-to-face teams. Team members that were more satisfied were more likely to have had training and used more communication methods compared to unsatisfied team members.

== Types ==
The most common types of virtual teams include:

1.     Networked teams

2.     Parallel teams

3.     Project development teams

4.     Work, production or functional teams

5.     Service teams

6.     Offshore ISD teams

7.     Global Virtual Teams

=== Networked teams ===
Generally, networked teams are geographically distributed and not necessarily from the same organization. These teams are frequently created and just as frequently dissolved; they are usually formed to discuss specific topics where members from the area of expertise, possibly from different organizations, pitch their ideas in the same discussion. Depending on the complexity of the issue, additional members to the team may be added at any time. The duration these teams last may vary significantly depending on how fast or slow the issue is resolved.

=== Parallel teams ===
Parallel teams are highly task oriented teams that usually consist of specialized professionals. While they are generally only required for short spans of time, unlike networked teams, they are not dissolved after completion of the tasks. The team may be either internal or external to the organization.

=== Project development teams ===
Similar to parallel teams, these teams are geographically distributed and may operate from different time zones. Project development teams are mainly focused on creating new products, information systems or organizational processes for users and/or customers. These teams exist longer than parallel teams and have the added ability to make decisions rather than just make recommendations. Similar to networked teams, project development teams may also add or remove members of their team at any given time, as needed for their area of expertise.

=== Work, production or functional teams ===
These teams are totally function specific where they only work on a particular area within an organization (i.e. finance, training, research, etc.). Operating virtually from different geographical locations, these teams exist to perform regular or ongoing tasks.

=== Service teams ===
Service teams are geographically located in different time-zones and are assigned to a particular service such as customer support, network upgrades, data maintenance, etc. Each team works on providing the particular service in their daylight hours and at the end of day, work is delegated to the next team which operates in a different time zone so that there is someone handling the service 24 hours a day.

=== Offshore ISD teams ===
Offshore ISD outsourcing teams are independent service provider teams that a company can subcontract portions of work to. These teams usually work in conjunction with an onshore team. Offshore ISD is commonly used for software development as well as international R&amp;D projects.

=== Global virtual teams ===
Global Virtual Teams (GVT) are defined as &quot;a group of workers, formally recognized by the organization as a team, with members from different countries who are collectively accountable for outputs across locations, and who utilize technology to some degree to accomplish their work&quot;. These teams usually span multiple countries and excel at their ability to transfer best practices across sites, resulting in substantial improvements in operations. However, they may struggle with establishing effective communication which engenders trust and engages team members.

== Management ==
According to Maznevksi and Chudoba (2000), the life circle of virtual team management includes five stages:

1.     Preparations

2.     Launch

3.     Performance management

4.     Team development

5.     Disbanding

=== Preparations ===
The initial task during the implementation of a team is the definition of the general purpose of the team together with the determination of the level of virtuality that might be appropriate to achieve these goals. Purpose is generally translated into certain action steps for people to on with a defined structure consisting of common goals, individual tasks and results. A number of factors may affect the performance of members of a virtual team. For example, team members with a higher degree of focused attention and aggregate lower levels of temporal dissociation (or flow ) may have higher performance. Further, members with higher degrees of attention focus may prefer asynchronous communication channels, while those with low levels of flow may prefer synchronous communication channels. These decisions are usually determined by strategic factors such as mergers, increase of the market span, cost reductions, flexibility and reactivity to the market, etc. Management-related activities taking place during the preparation phase include drafting a mission statement, personnel selection, task design, rewards system design, organizational integration, and choosing appropriate technologies for the tasks at hand.

=== Launch ===
In many cases, at the beginning of virtual teamwork, members make a point to meet each other face-to-face. Crucial elements of such a &quot;kick-off&quot; workshop are getting acquainted with the other team members, clarifying the team goals, clarifying the roles and functions of the team members, information and training how communication technologies can be used efficiently, and developing general rules for the teamwork. As a consequence, &quot;kick-off&quot; workshops are expected to promote clarification of team processes, trust building, building of a shared interpretative context, and high identification with the team.

Getting acquainted, goal clarification and development of intra-team rules are also usually accomplished during this phase. Initial field data that compares virtual teams with and without such &quot;kick-off&quot; meetings confirm a general positive impact on team effectiveness, although more differentiated research is necessary. Experimental studies demonstrate that getting acquainted before the start of computer-mediated work facilitates cooperation and trust.

=== Technology Agility ===
As soon as possible after launch, virtual teams must agree upon norms for technology use. Technology is essential to members’ interaction and communication. The electronic dependence integral to virtual work can however create logistical and technological constraints that limit informal spontaneous interacting and informal feedback, hindering knowledge interpretation and making corrective behavior more difficult. Therefore, team members must choose technology carefully, in order to offer the affordances needed at a given point in time, as each technology brings with it a number of affordances as well as constraints for interaction. An affordance is a purpose for use, and technology affordances refer to the mutually supportive relationship between human-endowed purposes to an activity and the technology use. Importantly, the need for certain affordances change over time as teams’ tasks evolve.
Gibson and her colleagues (2021) found that teams which were the most successful in progressing across different knowledge management activities used a &quot;dynamic connection repertoire&quot;, which is symbiotic with the nature of the task as it evolves over time. Rather than keeping a static technology repertoire, teams which co-evolved their purpose and technology affordances were better able to sustain effectiveness. A series of psychosocial cues were identified by Gibson and her colleagues, which signal the need to shift to different technologies, because the current technology use is failing to meet the teams’ needs.  These cues pertained to how well information was being shared and understood by all team members, and the extent to which members were engaged in the team. Technologies which allow for higher media richness, such as video and screen-sharing, can help reduce inconsistencies in context and make communication more personal and effective.

=== Performance Management ===
As time progresses in a virtual team, work effectiveness and a constructive team climate also have to be maintained using performance management strategies, such as those associated with leadership, conflict within virtual teams, and team members&#x27; motivation.

Leadership is a central challenge in virtual teams, as direct control is difficult when team managers are not at the same location as the team members. As a consequence, delegative management principles are considered that shift parts of classic managerial functions to the team members. However, team members only accept and fulfill such managerial functions when they are motivated and identify with the team and its goals, which is typically more difficult to achieve in virtual teams.Empirical research summarizes three leadership approaches that differ in the degree of team member autonomy: (1) electronic monitoring as an attempt to realize directive leadership over distance, (2) management by objectives (MBO) as an example for delegative leadership principles, and (3) self-managing teams as an example for rather autonomous teamwork.

With regard to conflict, predominant research issues have been conflict escalation and disinhibited communication (&quot;flaming&quot;), the fit between communication media and communication contents, and the role of non-job-related communication. One of the important needs for successful conflict resolution is the ability to have every member of the group together repeatedly over time. Effective dispersed groups show spikes in presence during communication over time, while ineffective groups do not have as dramatic spikes.

For the management of motivational and emotional processes, three groups of such processes have been addressed in empirical investigations so far: motivation and trust, team identification and cohesion, and satisfaction of the team members. Since most of the variables are originated within the person, they can vary considerably among the members of a team, requiring appropriate aggregation procedures for multilevel analyses (e.g. motivation may be mediated by interpersonal trust).

=== Team Development ===
The success and satisfaction of virtual teams can be supported by personnel and team development interventions. The development of such training concepts should be based on an empirical assessment of the needs and/or deficits of the team and its members, and the effectiveness of the trainings should be evaluated empirically. The steps of team developments include assessment of needs/deficits, individual and team training, and evaluation of training effects. Assessing behaviors of the team members to identify behavioral cues may improve virtual team dynamics and increase team productivity. Behaviors may be assessed through DiSC assessments.

Virtual teams have become more pertinent due to Covid-19. For managers, some of the ways to foster virtual team growth and success include monitoring trust levels, focusing on communication improvements, fostering inclusion via emotional safety within a group, and actively discussing teamwork with the group frequently.

=== Disbanding and Re-integration ===
Finally, while some teams remain ongoing and continue with new tasks or members, some virtual teams with shorter time frames go through a phase of disbanding and reintegration, during which members return to in-person offices or join other virtual projects. This disbanding and reintegration of team members is an important issue that has been neglected in both empirical and conceptual work on virtual teams. When virtual project teams have a short life cycle and reform again quickly, careful and constructive disbanding is crucial in order to maintain high motivation and satisfaction among employees. Members of transient project teams anticipate the end of the teamwork in the foreseeable future, which in turn can overshadow interaction with other team members and shared outcomes. The final stage of group development should be a gradual emotional disengagement that includes both sadness about separation and (in successful groups) joy and pride in the achievements of the team.

== Strengths of Virtual Teams ==

=== Team Composition ===
Virtual teams may help to create a more equal workplace, discouraging age, race, and disability discrimination by forcing individuals to interact with others whose differences challenge their assumptions. Physically disadvantaged employees are also able to participate more in teams where communication is virtual, where they may not have previously been able to due to physical limitations of an office or other workspace. Virtual teams also create a more accessible workplace for those who care for children or other family members, or workers who prefer flexible work arrangements for a wide range of reasons. By enabling more flexible and equal working conditions, virtual teams significantly expand the pool of available expertise, thereby allowing firms to acquire the best possible candidates.

Moreover, virtual teams’ use of communication technologies also helps to mitigate some problems of cultural diversity. For instance, email as a medium of communication does not transfer accents and carries fewer noticeable verbal language differences than voice communication. Cultural barriers are not removed from the team, but are instead shielded from view in situations where they are irrelevant. In fact, simply understanding team diversity and accommodating it can strengthen the relationship between team members of different cultures.

=== Innovation ===
When managed effectively, virtual teams can be highly effective in promoting innovation, creativity, and participation. For example, in Gibson and Gibbs’ (2006) study of design team innovation, teams were more innovative as virtuality increased when they had a psychologically safe communication climate. Because a company is able to recruit from a larger pool of employees when using virtual teams, a growing amount of talent and distributed expertise is obtainable without the employee traveling often. The use of virtual teams also allows employees to participate in multiple projects within the company that are located on different sites. This in turn helps the company by allowing them to reuse existing resources so that they are not required to hire a new employee to do the same job.

Chidambaram and Bostrom (1993) found that virtual teams generate more ideas compared to traditional teams. Part of this effect can be attributed to cultural diversity, which has been shown to positively impact group decision-making. Combined with collaborative conflict management, groups of individuals from different cultural perspectives are more likely to actively participate in group decision making. The differing backgrounds and experiences of these group members also encourage creativity and create conflicting viewpoints, which make it more likely that multiple options are explored and considered.

=== Geographic Reach ===
Multinational organizations often deploy global teams which span various national locations to serve as mechanisms for coordinating core operations across geographical and cultural boundaries. These virtual teams help to enhance knowledge sharing and integration across company locations, thereby expanding the geographic reach of firm operations at relatively low cost. Virtual teams further boost firms’ ability to identify and transfer best practices across locations, resulting in a substantial improvement to the operational efficiency of each site while preventing any one site from &quot;re-inventing the wheel&quot;.

=== National Diversity ===
Though national diversity may sometimes lead to conflicts and poor internal communication among team members due to differing ideas of a team and its operation, when managed correctly, virtual teams enable firms to take advantage of diverse and creative viewpoints. Notably, virtual teams are susceptible to intrapersonal identity conflict and struggle to develop a shared team vision due to strong identification with subgroups. Yet, these coordination problems and obstacles to effective communication may be solved by actively understanding and accepting differences in cultures. A multi-country study, based on the GLOBE culture model conducted by Gibson and Gibbs (2006), found that virtual communication environments were experienced differently by people from different cultures. The culture dimension individualism-collectivism was most strongly and very significantly related to how positively or negatively team members experienced videoconferences and telephone conferences, compared to face-to-face meetings. People from collectivistic societies showed a stronger preference for face-to-face meetings and evaluated virtual meetings more negatively compared to people from more individualistic societies.

However, Haas (2006) discovered that a mix of locals and cosmopolitans was optimal for global virtual team performance. Research examining product development efforts in over 20 firms has shown that when diverse members of project teams combined their perspectives in a highly iterative way to improve integrated information flow, they were more innovative. This is echoed by Gibbs and Gibson’s 2006 study which established that a psychologically safe communication climate where members feel comfortable asking questions can help bridge national differences, reduce ingroup/outgroup bias, and resolve conflicts, as teams who communicate openly are more likely to develop a common frame of reference and shared mental model. Ultimately, the exchange of diverse perspectives and information among global team members has been found to improve team and organizational performance through the generation of better knowledge sharing and higher quality solutions.

=== Reduction in Relocation and Travel ===
Virtual teams can save travel time and cost, significant expenses for businesses with multiple locations or having virtual clients located in multiple places. They also reduce disruption in the normal workday by not requiring an individual to physically leave their workspace. This improved efficiency can directly translate to saved costs for a company.

== Strategies to Mitigate Challenges of Virtual Work ==
Despite the improvement in telecommunication to overcome distance as an obstacle for collaboration, working in separate locations still increases the odds that people are not on common ground, and are not aware of it. Common ground, shared mutual knowledge, is an important element to successful communication and coordinated activity. Working separately and communicating through technology makes it more difficult to detect and resolve misunderstandings from a lack of common ground. As such, virtual teams often require a longer time to reach decisions.

However, virtual work has implications for relational impoverishment at work due to lower frequency of face-to-face interactions and lowered richness of communication. One major hurdle in drawing definitive conclusions is that studies of this innovation appear in dispersed literatures including information systems, logistics, industrial relations, psychology, operations, real estate, management, attracting the interest of scholars in multiple disciplines. Findings regarding challenges are presented below, but it is important to note that many mainstream models, largely developed with face-to-face workers in mind, often fail to account for the way telecommuters and virtual workers have challenged traditional labor structures.

=== Technology and Common Ground ===
When team members are highly dispersed, members are embedded in different external contexts and thus have less shared contextual knowledge, leading participants to take for granted common knowledge. Sole and Edmondson (2002) call this &quot;situated knowledge,&quot; finding evidence that the majority of conceptual misunderstandings resulted from lack of awareness of or failure to appropriate such knowledge. Such lack of mutual knowledge of each other’s situations increases coordination problems in acquiring knowledge and resources. Transactive memory is difficult to establish in virtual teams as it is often not transferred to new members, contextual knowledge is not kept or well-documented, and communication is indirect or infrequent. Development of this type of common ground is particularly difficult in virtual teams which are structurally dynamic or experience high turnover, as teams with a short history together tend to lack effective patterns of information sharing and working together, limiting the amount and variety of information that can be communicated across team members.

One way to develop common ground in virtual teams is to develop a psychologically safe communication climate which acts as a moderating variable that can overcome mistrust and turn the team’s fluid membership into a source of new ideas and expertise. A supportive communication climate includes variables such as participation in decision-making, encouraging members to speak up, raising differences for discussion, engaging in spontaneous and informal communication, providing unsolicited information, remaining open to new ideas and perspectives, and bridging differences by suspending judgment. This helps to create trust and reduce perceptions of risk and uncertainty about members’ motives, in turn creating incentives to build a shared history.

Another way to develop common knowledge rests on managers’ ability to act as politicians to manage the power dynamic inside and outside the team. This may reduce members’ hesitancy to share information, leading to enhanced innovation. A study by Gibbs and her colleagues (2021) indicates that managers can also bridge imbalances in situated knowledge during meetings by discussing trivial topics and surfacing taken-for-granted assumptions as a way to elicit differing opinions and hidden knowledge. In one instance, a manager increased dialogue among team members by deliberately refraining from giving people answers in order to encourage them to cooperate and co-create knowledge. Though more difficult than in collocated teams, careful management and co-presence strategies can successfully establish common ground among members of a virtual team.

=== Uneven Distribution of Information ===
Errors in the distribution of messages are more common in technology than face-to-face interaction, leading to a lack of common ground. When digital technology replaces face-to-face communication, it is often difficult to keep track of the messages that have been both sent and received by a receiver and vice versa. For instance, if collaborators have two email addresses, a primary and a secondary one, some messages may be sent by the server to the primary addresses and some to the secondary addresses, leading to information loss and confusion among team members. Intimacy is further threatened as perceived electronic mediation increases because such mediation leads to uneven information transfer and coordination challenges and reduces the amount of informal interaction, as the number of casual encounters and unplanned conversations is much higher among collocated colleagues.

Simultaneously, differences in native language and status- the &quot;prestige, esteem, worth, or relative social position of an individual or group&quot;- inhibit open dialogue and can lead to uneven participation, one-way flows of knowledge, and exclusion. These status differences are subjective and socially constructed through interpersonal processes of stratification that play out in both verbal and nonverbal communication. Consequently, teams which foster an open dialogic environment through conversational turn-taking, active listening, and energy-enhancing practices achieve better participation and overcome status differences, in turn boosting collective intelligence and limiting miscommunications.

Strategies to mitigate uneven distribution of information include structure-enabling practices which promote equal participation, such as regular calls, clear agendas established in advance of meetings, rotating presentations to give voice to lower-status members, and post-call follow ups to ensure a sense of role clarity and predictability. Furthermore, fostering knowledge repositories which seek to not only create new knowledge but record and catalogue existing knowledge helps to mitigate uneven information distribution and facilitate ongoing knowledge transfer. Managers can make a big difference in team participation by establishing dialogic practices which build rapport and trust, strengthen team communication and participation, and invite input from everyone. These practices help to bridge status differences and ensure team members are on the same page.

=== Differences in What Information is Salient ===
Computer-mediated communication (CMC) reduces nonverbal cues about interpersonal affections such as tone, warmth, and attentiveness, which contribute to message clarity and communication richness, and collaborators who use CMC often use more direct styles of communication with fewer social cues than those in face-to-face conditions. Zhao (2003) found that communicators use physical and linguistic &quot;co-presence&quot;- the subjective perception of closeness versus distance to make inferences about one another’s knowledge. Virtual workers are likely to have reduced contact and exposure to strong organizational structures and processes (including organizational dress, symbols, rituals, and ceremonies) that typically foster organizational identification. Difficulty in interpreting knowledge reduces experimentation, which may impact the improvisation processes vital to engendering innovation.

In face-to-face interaction, the speaker makes the importance of a message known through tone of voice, facial expression, and bodily gestures. The receiver may acknowledge understanding through exact feedback called &quot;back-channel&quot; communication, such as head nods, brief verbalizations like &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;okay,&quot; or smiles. These methods of emphasis and feedback ensure parties are on common ground. However, these methods are often lost in digital means of communication. For example, in an e-mail exchange, the point of the message as intended by the sender may be overlooked, misinterpreted, or given different priority. Furthermore, messages met with silence are highly ambiguous and can act as a barrier to establishing common ground. For instance, silence can be due to technical problems within the technology that mediates the parties involved in communication, or it can be due to the fact that one of the partners is out of town and cannot reply to the message. Silence can also be taken in many ways, as agreement, disagreement, passive aggression, and indifference, or in the case of dispersed groups, that the message was undelivered. Silence may lead to conflict because it blurs the notion of what is known and unknown in the group, signaling the absence of common ground. Fully implementing &quot;back-channel&quot; communication can be time-consuming. The lack of convenient cues in digital communication make dispersed collaboration less conducive for the establishment of mutual knowledge.

The challenges presented by electronic dependence may be mitigated through the use of technologies allowing for higher media richness, which help to provide context and nuance in virtual communications. Remote collaborations may be enhanced by co-presence design or the development of tools to enhance perceived co-presence such as online avatars or added conference call features like visual representation, turn taking, or private chat. Further, Maznevski and Chudoba (2000) found that developing predictable temporal rhythms of technology and routines of media usage improved close working relationships.  Subsequent research has also highlighted the importance of co-presence for  psychological well-being and productivity.

Moreover, practices such as informal conversations among colleagues, virtual &quot;water cooler chat,&quot; personal introductions, and discussions on trivial topics help to build connectedness and trust among virtual teams. For instance, many companies during the Covid-19 pandemic introduced 1:1 buddies, virtual coffee breaks, and digital town halls in order to increase co-presence and team identification. Team members who trust one another are more likely to ask follow-up questions for clarification, avoid snap judgments born out of miscommunication, and accept others’ advice and information. This in turn reduces the challenges associated with lost social cues during digital communication.

=== Differences in Speed, Timing, and Responsiveness ===
Speed and timing of communication is inevitably not as uniformed in digital communication as it is in face-to-face interaction. This is due to the fact that some parties have more restricted access to communication than others. The differences in relative speed and timing of feedback and conference calls are aggravated by differences in time zones, which can sharpen status differences and bolster resentment from sidelined locations.  One part of the team on one side of the world may be asleep during another part’s normal workday, and the group has to work around this. These issues may be ameliorated by alternating night and morning calls for each location, having two separate meetings for different zones, or asking certain locations to participate in calls at unusual hours.

In some cases, the problems arising from differences in relative speed may be attributed instead to a lack of conscientiousness on the part of the slower partners. In fact, a fluctuating feedback cycle is more destructive than a uniformed feedback cycle of a slower pace. Further, McLarnon et al. (2019) uncovered that regular feedback exchanges demonstrated a more substantial indirect effect on team performance than scenarios where feedback was only provided post-project or obtained weekly without distribution to peers. Consequently, establishing a structured system for regular peer feedback can significantly enhance intra-team processes and overall functionality within virtual teams. Asynchronous communication tends to be more difficult to manage and requires much greater coordination than synchronous communication. As Gibson et al. (2011) found, developing consistent, time-patterned routines of communication may help to build close working relationships. Technology affordances such as a public forum where team members can post and reply to questions may also encourage timely responses and enhance ongoing knowledge transfer.

In other instances, low responsiveness stems from cultural norms which dictate how quickly workers are expected to respond and when they can be reached. For example, one study found that Western Australians may express a &quot;can do&quot; attitude and a direct communication style while Jamaicans tend to be more conflict-avoidant in organizational settings and have a more fluid orientation to time. These cultural differences play an important role in how power and status differences are fostered and how they impact participation in teams. Rather than &quot;sweeping them under the rug,&quot; it is important to acknowledge differences in culture or opinion so they can be addressed through adaptation and agreeable solutions.  Shared norms which bridge the differences can help resolve potential conflicts in preferences.

Virtual teams have also historically highlighted a generational gap, as many older executives and senior managers do not have as much experience with computer technology as their younger counterparts. These senior members must then exert extra energy to catch up to the younger generation and navigate new means of communicating. This difficulty is less pertinent today, as most workers have some level of fluency with digital media and firms often provide training to equalize workers’ knowledge of communication tools.

== Emerging Issues ==

=== Covid-19 Pandemic ===
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the virtual dimension of teamwork has gained greater prominence everywhere from social media to academic scholarship. Research on remote work has largely focused on outcomes differentiating between individuals who do and do not engage in remote work. However, as Zhang, Yu and Marin (2021) point out, during the Covid-19 pandemic, many employees were forced to work remotely. The beginning of the pandemic was marked by a rapid transition to virtual work, closures of traditional workspaces, physical distancing requirements, difficulties distributing technology and adapting to at-home work conditions, and feelings of isolation and hopelessness among newly virtual employees.

Within this, the employee satisfaction and health outcomes associated with virtual work, largely neglected by pre-pandemic literature, have quickly come to the forefront of management research. Pre-pandemic studies found that the high levels of perceived electronic dependence and lack of copresence which often accompany virtual work can negatively affect critical psychological states of experienced meaningfulness, experienced responsibility, and knowledge of results. Likewise, while a supportive communication climate predicts satisfaction and commitment and includes variables such as participation in decision-making and communication openness, these factors are more difficult to establish in virtual settings. Thus, satisfaction among the team members of a virtual team has been shown to be less positive than satisfaction among face-to-face teams. This drop in satisfaction is due in part to difficulties building trust without face-to-face communications, a necessary part of high-performing virtual teams. However, effective management and adherence to proper goal setting principles specific to the nature of work virtual teams require can lead to improved team effectiveness. If a team and its corresponding management is not prepared for the challenges of a virtual team, this will be difficult to achieve.

Recent research by Zhang, Yu, and Marin (2021: 802) discovered that workers had a generally positive attitude towards working at home, citing the availability of collaboration and communication tools, increased productivity, and remote learning and flexible work hours. Conversely, workers frequently complained that long hours of teleconferencing could be draining, individuals’ capacity to work remotely was impeded by suboptimal home office setups, information-sensitive work was susceptible to cyber-security attacks, and that decentralized set-ups harmed work team engagement. While some workers experienced improved work-life balance due to spending more time with family, others reported their work-life balance was harmed due to difficulties maintaining the boundary between family and work.

=== Care in Connecting ===
Rather than &quot;social distancing,&quot; Gibson (2020) proposes the approach Care in Connecting, which acknowledges the need for caution in terms of physical proximity, but also promotes the urgent need for compassion that individuals and organizations provide and receive. Care in Connecting centers around three principles which counter the prejudice, isolation, and hopelessness associated with social distancing: inclusion, copresence, and vitality.

Care in Connecting creates inclusion when diverse voices are heard and incorporated online. A number of scholars addressing inclusion and intercultural collaboration have revealed the importance of recognizing the uniqueness of individual constituents while also cultivating a sense of belonging to a collectivity. Research shows that members who identify with their team are more likely to display desirable individual workplace outcomes such as helping behavior, organizational citizenship behavior, lowered social undermining and social loafing, lessened workplace bullying, and fewer turnover intentions. Organizations prioritizing inclusion during the pandemic have adopted approaches including overtime pay, unlimited sick days, paid leaves of absence, free trials of higher education to help connect job seekers to opportunities, and donated medical supplies. These inclusionary practices involve understanding employees’ unique experiences and avoiding assumptions, stereotypes, and grand generalizations.

Care in Connecting also creates co-presence, the experience of psychological proximity achievable online, to counteract feelings of isolation felt as a result of social distancing (Gibson, 2020: 166). Key to virtual team effectiveness is the team’s ability to understand which tool is most effective given the task and to selectively tailor combinations of technology to achieve copresence. Many organizations have sought to implement new practices during the pandemic to build a sense of copresence by ensuring access to technology and establishing the human element. Examples include purchasing laptops and audio equipment for workers, loaning tablets to students, implementing virtual coffee breaks or lunches, inviting workers’ children to join meetings, and promoting opportunities to connect as human beings.

Finally, Care in Connecting can enable vitality, a sense of psychological and physical energy, to address the sense of hopelessness engendered by social distancing. A significant body of research indicates that people both mimic and feel the emotions displayed by others and can receive and experience energy from interpersonal interactions. Organizations which provided examples of positivity and resilience in online interactions were able to spark positive emotional contagion and increased vitality. Many organizations communicated simple messages of care and composure, offered morning meditation sessions, allowed pets on screen for relaxation, conducted online yoga and fitness sessions, and sent out care packages to employees.

=== Emerging Research ===
There is still much unknown about the impact of Covid-19 on virtual teamwork, particularly in how employees will respond in the long-term to the blurring of public and private space and how the reorganization of reopened sites will unfold. Emerging research suggests that returning to work in the &quot;new normal&quot; after being out of work or teleworking to some capacity creates issues with employee focus, engagement, and mental reattachment to upcoming work. Furthermore, Shao et al. (2021) argue that workers’ newfound flexibility in working from home or at the office is impacted by stressors they encountered on the previous day. This research has implications for understanding the driving factors of daily work location choices, and how telework will unfold in a post-Covid world.

Another research concern centers on the nonnegligible chance of community transmission in the workplace which poses a threat to returning workers. While many workplaces shut down following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, others in essential industries had to remain operational, thus exposing employees to virus dangers. However, firms varied significantly in the degree to which they took action to protect their employees. Steinbach, Kautz and Korsgaard (2021) found that these firm compensation actions were associated with a growth in positive stakeholder sentiment. The reintegration of workers into face-to-face work settings has also launched academic debate on privacy and ethical concerns surrounding mandatory vaccination requirements and/or weekly testing. While our knowledge of online collaboration has yet to incorporate the dynamic urgency created by the pandemic, it is very likely that closures of traditional workplaces, physical distancing requirements, and the difficulties firms face reopening sites will fundamentally shift research on virtual work.

<text>Dupax del Norte, officially the Municipality of Dupax del Norte (; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 33,295 people.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Dupax stems from the Isinay term &quot;dopaj,&quot; denoting &quot;to recline in utter relaxation and repose&quot;, expressing the desire of the locals to unwind fully after refurbishing their camp, enjoying their harvest, and concluding their forest hunts before returning home.

Prior to the establishment of Dupax, the site of what would be its town proper served as a camp for hunters from surrounding tribal settlements.

The area, either a plain or a valley, was located near their hunting grounds, and became their settlement as the town of &quot;Dopaj&quot;. The name later changed into &quot;Dupax&quot; when the Spaniards, upon their arrival, substituted letter &quot;j&quot; for &quot;x&quot; for convenience.

==History==
The town of Dupax was first discovered by Luis Pérez Dasmariñas in 1591. Eighteen years later, the mission was established by the Dominicans, but was later abandoned due to territorial disputes with the Franciscans.

Colonization seemed difficult for decades. In 1717, Fr. Alejandro Cacho came on mission to Dupax and established Christian communities. On April 22, 1731, Dupax was founded as an urban settlement by the Augustinian missionaries Fr. Nicolas Norbantes and Fr. Agustin San Juan.

In the early 18th century, Dupax was inhabited by three tribes. The Malaats from Ituy, said to be the ancestors of the Isinays, the town&#x27;s first inhabitants, occupied an area known as Parai. The other two were the Caraos and the Bugcalots.

As early as 1928, during the term of Municipal President Inocencio Suzon, there were attempts to transfer the town hall to Barrio Malasin (poblacion of the present Dupax del Norte) from the poblacion (the present poblacion of Dupax del Sur). On November 28, 1931, during the incumbency of Municipal President Tranquilino Orden, the Municipal Council has approved Resolution No. 94 sponsored by Councilor Victoriano Barroga proposing the transfer of the seat of the municipal government from the old poblacion to Malasin. Congressman Leonardo B. Perez sponsored a bill on that matter. By virtue of &quot;Republic Act (RA) No. 1181&quot; approved on June 20, 1954, the seat of government was transferred from old &quot;poblacion&quot; to Barrio Malasin, whose location is not only strategic but is beside the town&#x27;s commercial center.

Dupax then was the largest municipality in Nueva Vizcaya in terms of land area prior to division into three separate ones. &quot;RA No. 6372&quot;, sponsored by Representative Benjamin Perez and Senator Leonardo Perez, was approved on August 16, 1971, dividing Dupax into two new municipalities: Dupax del Norte, which would consist the &quot;poblacion&quot; of Malasin, designated as the seat of government, eight &quot;barrios&quot; and sixteen &quot;sitios&quot;; and Dupax del Sur. As the creation of the latter was later ratified in a plebiscite, the division was only implemented through &quot;Presidential Decree No. 586&quot; promulgated by President Ferdinand Marcos on November 20, 1974.

In 1979, through &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 27&quot; approved by Marcos, four &quot;barangays&quot; and a &quot;sitio&quot; in the municipality, along with parts of Dupax del Sur, were separated to constitute into a municipality, Alfonso Castañeda.

==Geography==
Dupax del Norte is situated on the south-eastern part of Nueva Vizcaya. It is bounded by the town of Kasibu in the north, Alfonso Castañeda in the east, Dupax del Sur in the south, and Bambang in the west. It has wide tracts of virgin forests, rich, fertile plains and valleys with mineral deposits and has a climate suitable for agriculture.

Dupax del Norte is from Manila and from Bayombong.

===Barangays===

Dupax del Norte is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* Belance
* Binuangan
* Bitnong
* Bulala
* Inaban
* Ineangan
* Lamo
* Mabasa
* Macabenga
* Malasin (Poblacion)
* Munguia
* New Gumiad
* Oyao
* Parai
* Yabbi
====Mabasa====
&quot;Mabasa&quot; (Iloko for &quot;wet&quot;) is a barangay of Dupax del Norte. It was one of the oldest barrio of Dupax (when the town was not yet divided into two). Mabasa was originally called San Roque, named by the parish priest of Dupax after the saint of hunters because the place then was a thick forest where game was abundant such as deer and wild pigs.

The first settlers of San Roque were Ilokano migrants from the town of Paoay in Ilocos Norte and from Alcala and San Nicolas towns in Pangasinan. They travelled by foot and by horses and carabaos through San Nicolas, passing through Imugan, Santa Fe, Nueva Vizcaya. The migrants settled at Sitio Poonan (later called Puongan). The family of Apolonio Vadil was the first settler in Poungan. Old records from the Roman Catholic Church in Dupax del Sur showed that the daughter of Apolonio Vadil, Tomasa, was baptized on October 10, 1887.

More migrants came and settled along the Apean (Apayan) River from Puongan upstream and occupied the western part of the barrio now called Riverside East and Riverside West. The settlers found the place always flowing with abundant water coming from a spring in the eastern part of the barrio, and so they called the place &quot;Nabasa&quot; which means &quot;wet&quot; in Iloko language. It was later officially called &quot;Mabasa&quot; changing from the old name of &quot;San Roque.&quot;

====Inaban====
The name came from the Iloko word &quot;Inabaan&quot; which means a place where there are plenty of &quot;gabi&quot; (taro) plants, locally known as “ABA”. In the early days, giant &quot;gabi&quot; plants with leaves as big as umbrellas thrived in the vicinity of this barangay.

A story goes that many years ago when the place was still thickly covered with flora and fauna, and was a favorite hunting ground, a hunter once hit a big male deer with his spear. However, the deer was not mortally wounded and it decided to attack the hunter. The man and the deer fought for about an hour but in the end, the man triumphed over the animal but the hunter was seriously wounded. Alone, he tried to find his way home. But then it began to rain, he sought shelter under the big leaves of the &quot;gabi&quot; plants. Unfortunately, the hunter died because of his wounds and days after, his remains were found under the &quot;gabi&quot; plants.

During World War II, American soldiers pronounced the word &quot;Inabaan&quot; into &quot;Inaban&quot;.

Inaban was formally created in 1963 as a barangay of Dupax (now Dupax del Norte) by virtue of Republic Act No. 3590.

<text>Pomona is a small village on the Choele Choel Island in the Avellaneda Department in the Río Negro Province, in Argentina. It was already a crossing point for the Negro River to the island in 1890, when it was known as &quot;Paso Peñalva&quot;, on the way to Choele Choel. It was formally founded in 1933 and named after the goddess Pomona, because of its gardens.

Provincial Primary School #7 is located there, containing an agrotechnic school and a municipal library. In the Pomona area, there are farms that cultivate mainly pears and apples, but also peaches and trees for wood. Its closest city is Lamarque, to which is connected by the National Route 250.

<text>The human eye is a sensory organ in the visual system that reacts to visible light allowing eyesight. Other functions include maintaining the circadian rhythm, and keeping balance.

The eye can be considered as a living optical device. It is approximately spherical in shape, with its outer layers, such as the outermost, white part of the eye (the sclera) and one of its inner layers (the pigmented choroid) keeping the eye essentially light tight except on the eye&#x27;s optic axis. In order, along the optic axis, the optical components consist of a first lens (the cornea—the clear part of the eye) that accounts for most of the optical power of the eye and accomplishes most of the focusing of light from the outside world; then an aperture (the pupil) in a diaphragm (the iris—the coloured part of the eye) that controls the amount of light entering the interior of the eye; then another lens (the crystalline lens) that accomplishes the remaining focusing of light into images; and finally a light-sensitive part of the eye (the retina), where the images fall and are processed. The retina makes a connection to the brain via the optic nerve. The remaining components of the eye keep it in its required shape, nourish and maintain it, and protect it.

Three types of cells in the retina convert light energy into electrical energy used by the nervous system: rods respond to low intensity light and contribute to perception of low-resolution, black-and-white images; cones respond to high intensity light and contribute to perception of high-resolution, coloured images; and the recently discovered photosensitive ganglion cells respond to a full range of light intensities and contribute to adjusting the amount of light reaching the retina, to regulating and suppressing the hormone melatonin, and to entraining circadian rhythm.

== Structure ==
Humans have two eyes, situated on the left and the right of the face. The eyes sit in bony cavities called the orbits, in the skull. There are six extraocular muscles that control eye movements. The front visible part of the eye is made up of the whitish sclera, a coloured iris, and the pupil. A thin layer called the conjunctiva sits on top of this. The front part is also called the anterior segment of the eye.

The eye is not shaped like a perfect sphere; rather it is a fused two-piece unit, composed of an anterior (front) segment and the posterior (back) segment. The anterior segment is made up of the cornea, iris and lens. The cornea is transparent and more curved and is linked to the larger posterior segment, composed of the vitreous, retina, choroid and the outer white shell called the sclera. The cornea is typically about in diameter, and 0.5 mm (500 μm) in thickness near its centre. The posterior chamber constitutes the remaining five-sixths; its diameter is typically about . An area termed the limbus connects the cornea and sclera. The iris is the pigmented circular structure concentrically surrounding the centre of the eye, the pupil, which appears to be black. The size of the pupil, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, is adjusted by the iris&#x27; dilator and sphincter muscles.

Light energy enters the eye through the cornea, through the pupil and then through the lens. The lens shape is changed for near focus (accommodation) and is controlled by the ciliary muscle. Between the two lenses (the cornea and the crystalline lens), there are four optical surfaces which each refract light as it travels along the optical path. One basic model describing the geometry of the optical system is the Arizona Eye Model. This model describes the accommodation of the eye geometrically. Photons of light falling on the light-sensitive cells of the retina (photoreceptor cones and rods) are converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve and interpreted as sight and vision.

=== Development ===
The human eye primarily develops from the ectoderm. The lens and the epithelium of the cornea arise from the surface ectoderm directly; other structures come from either the neural ectoderm or the neural crest, which itself arises from the ectoderm. The mesoderm has limited contributions: it is the origin of the vitreous body, the blood vessels of the eye, and the extraocular muscles.

=== Size ===
The size of the eye differs among adults by only 1-2 mm. The eyeball is generally less tall than it is wide. The sagittal vertical (height) of a human adult eye is approximately , the transverse horizontal diameter (width) is and the axial anteroposterior size (depth) averages with no significant difference between sexes and age groups. Strong correlation has been found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit (r = 0.88). The typical adult eye has an anterior to posterior diameter of , and a volume of .

The eyeball grows rapidly, increasing from about diameter at birth to by three years of age. By age 12, the eye attains its full size.

=== Components ===

The eye is made up of three coats, or layers, enclosing various anatomical structures. The outermost layer, known as the fibrous tunic, is composed of the cornea and sclera, which provide shape to the eye and support the deeper structures. The middle layer, known as the vascular tunic or uvea, consists of the choroid, ciliary body, pigmented epithelium and iris. The innermost is the retina, which gets its oxygenation from the blood vessels of the choroid (posteriorly) as well as the retinal vessels (anteriorly).

The spaces of the eye are filled with the aqueous humour anteriorly, between the cornea and lens, and the vitreous body, a jelly-like substance, behind the lens, filling the entire posterior cavity. The aqueous humour is a clear watery fluid that is contained in two areas: the anterior chamber between the cornea and the iris, and the posterior chamber between the iris and the lens. The lens is suspended to the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament (zonule of Zinn), made up of hundreds of fine transparent fibers which transmit muscular forces to change the shape of the lens for accommodation (focusing). The vitreous body is a clear substance composed of water and proteins, which give it a jelly-like and sticky composition.

=== Extraocular muscles ===

Each eye has seven extraocular muscles located in its orbit. Six of these muscles control the eye movements, the seventh controls the movement of the upper eyelid. The six muscles are four recti muscles – the lateral rectus, the medial rectus, the inferior rectus, and the superior rectus, and two oblique muscles the inferior oblique, and the superior oblique. The seventh muscle is the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. When the muscles exert different tensions, a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn, in almost pure rotation, with only about one millimeter of translation. Thus, the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations about a single point in the centre of the eye.

== Vision ==
=== Field of view ===

The approximate field of view of an individual human eye (measured from the fixation point, i.e., the point at which one&#x27;s gaze is directed) varies by facial anatomy, but is typically 30° superior (up, limited by the brow), 45° nasal (limited by the nose), 70° inferior (down), and 100° temporal (towards the temple). For both eyes, combined (binocular vision) visual field is approximately 100° vertical and a maximum 190° horizontal, approximately 120° of which makes up the binocular field of view (seen by both eyes) flanked by two uniocular fields (seen by only one eye) of approximately 40 degrees. It is an area of 4.17 steradians or 13700 square degrees for binocular vision. When viewed at large angles from the side, the iris and pupil may still be visible by the viewer, indicating the person has peripheral vision possible at that angle.

About 15° temporal and 1.5° below the horizontal is the blind spot created by the optic nerve nasally, which is roughly 7.5° high and 5.5° wide.

=== Dynamic range ===
The retina has a static contrast ratio of around 100:1 (about 6.5 f-stops). As soon as the eye moves rapidly to acquire a target (saccades), it re-adjusts its exposure by adjusting the iris, which adjusts the size of the pupil. Initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound, uninterrupted darkness; full adaptation through adjustments in retinal rod photoreceptors is 80% complete in thirty minutes. The process is nonlinear and multifaceted, so an interruption by light exposure requires restarting the dark adaptation process over again.The human eye can detect a luminance from 10−6 cd/m2, or one millionth (0.000001) of a candela per square meter to 108 cd/m2 or one hundred million (100,000,000) candelas per square meter. (that is it has a range of 1014, or one hundred trillion 100,000,000,000,000, about 46.5 f-stops). This range does not include looking at the midday sun (109 cd/m2) or lightning discharge.

At the low end of the range is the absolute threshold of vision for a steady light across a wide field of view, about 10−6 cd/m2 (0.000001 candela per square meter). The upper end of the range is given in terms of normal visual performance as 108 cd/m2 (100,000,000 or one hundred million candelas per square meter).

The eye includes a lens similar to lenses found in optical instruments such as cameras and the same physics principles can be applied. The pupil of the human eye is its aperture; the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop. Refraction in the cornea causes the effective aperture (the entrance pupil) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4 mm in diameter, although it can range from 2 mm () in a brightly lit place to 8 mm () in the dark. The latter value decreases slowly with age; older people&#x27;s eyes sometimes dilate to not more than 5–6mm in the dark, and may be as small as 1mm in the light.

== Movement ==

The visual system in the human brain is too slow to process information if images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second. Thus, to be able to see while moving, the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes. Frontal-eyed animals have a small area of the retina with very high visual acuity, the fovea centralis. It covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Any failure to make eye movements correctly can lead to serious visual degradation.

Having two eyes allows the brain to determine the depth and distance of an object, called stereovision, and gives the sense of three-dimensionality to the vision. Both eyes must point accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas to stimulate stereovision; otherwise, double vision might occur. Some persons with congenitally crossed eyes tend to ignore one eye&#x27;s vision, thus do not suffer double vision, and do not have stereovision. The movements of the eye are controlled by six muscles attached to each eye, and allow the eye to elevate, depress, converge, diverge and roll. These muscles are both controlled voluntarily and involuntarily to track objects and correct for simultaneous head movements.

=== Rapid ===

Rapid eye movement, REM, typically refers to the sleep stage during which the most vivid dreams occur. During this stage, the eyes move rapidly.

=== Saccadian ===

Saccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction controlled by the frontal lobe of the brain.

=== Fixational ===

Even when looking intently at a single spot, the eyes drift around. This ensures that individual photosensitive cells are continually stimulated in different degrees. Without changing input, these cells would otherwise stop generating output.

Eye movements include drift, ocular tremor, and microsaccades. Some irregular drifts, movements smaller than a saccade and larger than a microsaccade, subtend up to one tenth of a degree. Researchers vary in their definition of microsaccades by amplitude. Martin Rolfs states that &#x27;the majority of microsaccades observed in a variety of tasks have amplitudes smaller than 30 min-arc&#x27;. However, others state that the &quot;current consensus has largely consolidated around a definition of microsaccades that includes magnitudes up to 1°.&quot;

=== Vestibulo-ocular ===

The vestibulo-ocular reflex is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement in response to neural input from the vestibular system of the inner ear, thus maintaining the image in the centre of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left. This applies for head movements up and down, left and right, and tilt to the right and left, all of which give input to the ocular muscles to maintain visual stability.

=== Smooth pursuit ===

Eyes can also follow a moving object around. This tracking is less accurate than the vestibulo-ocular reflex, as it requires the brain to process incoming visual information and supply feedback. Following an object moving at constant speed is relatively easy, though the eyes will often make saccades to keep up. The smooth pursuit movement can move the eye at up to 100°/s in adult humans.

It is more difficult to visually estimate speed in low light conditions or while moving, unless there is another point of reference for determining speed.

=== Optokinetic ===
The optokinetic reflex (or optokinetic nystagmus) stabilizes the image on the retina through visual feedback. It is induced when the entire visual scene drifts across the retina, eliciting eye rotation in the same direction and at a velocity that minimizes the motion of the image on the retina. When the gaze direction deviates too far from the forward heading, a compensatory saccade is induced to reset the gaze to the centre of the visual field.

For example, when looking out of the window at a moving train, the eyes can focus on a moving train for a short moment (by stabilizing it on the retina), until the train moves out of the field of vision. At this point, the eye is moved back to the point where it first saw the train (through a saccade).

== Near response ==
The adjustment to close-range vision involves three processes to focus an image on the retina.

=== Vergence movement ===
When a creature with binocular vision looks at an object, the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis so that the projection of the image is in the centre of the retina in both eyes. To look at a nearby object, the eyes rotate &#x27;towards each other&#x27; (convergence), while for an object farther away they rotate &#x27;away from each other&#x27; (divergence).

=== Pupil constriction ===
Lenses cannot refract light rays at their edges as well as closer to the centre. The image produced by any lens is therefore somewhat blurry around the edges (spherical aberration). It can be minimized by screening out peripheral light rays and looking only at the better-focused centre. In the eye, the pupil serves this purpose by constricting while the eye is focused on nearby objects. Small apertures also give an increase in depth of field, allowing a broader range of &quot;in focus&quot; vision. In this way the pupil has a dual purpose for near vision: to reduce spherical aberration and increase depth of field.

=== Lens accommodation ===

Changing the curvature of the lens is carried out by the ciliary muscles surrounding the lens; this process is known as &quot;accommodation&quot;. Accommodation narrows the inner diameter of the ciliary body, which actually relaxes the fibers of the suspensory ligament attached to the periphery of the lens, and also allows the lens to relax into a more convex, or globular, shape. A more convex lens refracts light more strongly and focuses divergent light rays from near objects onto the retina, allowing closer objects to be brought into better focus.

== Medicine ==
The human eye contains enough complexity to warrant specialized attention and care beyond the duties of a general practitioner. These specialists, or eye care professionals, serve different functions in different countries. Eye care professionals can have overlap in their patient care privileges. For example, both an ophthalmologist (M.D.) and optometrist (O.D.) are professionals who diagnose eye disease and can prescribe lenses to correct vision. Typically, only ophthalmologists are licensed to perform surgical procedures. Ophthalmologists may also specialize within a surgical area, such as cornea, cataracts, laser, retina, or oculoplastics.

Eye care professionals include:
* Ocularists
* Ophthalmologists
* Optometrists
* Opticians
* Orthoptists and vision therapists

== Pigmentation ==

===Brown===

Almost all mammals have brown or darkly-pigmented irises. In humans, brown is by far the most common eye color, with approximately 79% of people in the world having it. Brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of melanin in the stroma of the iris, which causes light of both shorter and longer wavelengths to be absorbed.

In many parts of the world, it is nearly the only iris color present. Brown eyes are common in Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, West Asia, Oceania, Africa and the Americas. Light or medium-pigmented brown eyes can also be commonly found in Europe, among the Americas, and parts of Central Asia, West Asia and South Asia. Light brown eyes bordering amber and hazel coloration are common in Europe, but can also be observed in East Asia and Southeast Asia, though are uncommon in the region.

===Amber===
Amber eyes are a solid color with a strong yellowish/golden and russet/coppery tint, which may be due to the yellow pigment called lipochrome (also found in green eyes). Amber eyes should not be confused with hazel eyes. Although hazel eyes may contain specks of amber or gold, they usually tend to have many other colors, including green, brown and orange. Also, hazel eyes may appear to shift in color and consist of flecks and ripples, while amber eyes are of a solid gold hue. Even though amber is similar to gold, some people have russet or copper colored amber eyes that are mistaken for hazel, though hazel tends to be duller and contains green with red/gold flecks, as mentioned above. Amber eyes may also contain amounts of very light gold-ish gray. People with that eye color are common in northern Europe, and in fewer numbers in southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and South America.

===Hazel===
Hazel eyes are due to a combination of Rayleigh scattering and a moderate amount of melanin in the iris&#x27; anterior border layer. Hazel eyes often appear to shift in color from a brown to a green. Although hazel mostly consists of brown and green, the dominant color in the eye can either be brown/gold or green. This is why hazel eyes can be mistaken as amber and vice versa. The combination can sometimes produce a multicolored iris, i.e., an eye that is light brown/amber near the pupil and charcoal or dark green on the outer part of the iris (or vice versa) when observed in sunlight.

Definitions of the eye color &quot;hazel&quot; vary: it is sometimes considered to be synonymous with light brown or gold, as in the color of a hazelnut shell.

Around 18% of the US population and 5% of the world population have hazel eyes. Hazel eyes are found in Europe, most commonly in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and have also been observed to be very common among the Low Saxon speaking populations of northern Germany.

===Green===

Green eyes are most common in Northern, Western and Central Europe. Around 8–10% of men and 18–21% of women in Iceland and 6% of men and 17% of women in the Netherlands have green eyes. Among European Americans, green eyes are most common among those of recent Celtic and Germanic ancestry, with about 16%.

The green color is caused by the combination of: 1) an amber or light brown pigmentation in the stroma of the iris (which has a low or moderate concentration of melanin) with: 2) a blue shade created by the Rayleigh scattering of reflected light. Green eyes contain the yellowish pigment lipochrome.

===Blue===
The inheritance pattern followed by blue eyes was previously assumed to be a mendelian recessive trait, however, eye color inheritance is now recognized as a polygenic trait, meaning that it is controlled by the interactions of several genes.

Blue eyes are predominant in northern and eastern Europe, particularly around the Baltic Sea. Blue eyes are also found in southern Europe, Central Asia, South Asia, North Africa and West Asia.

Approximately 8% to 10% of the global population have blue eyes. A 2002 study found that the prevalence of blue eye color among the white population in the United States to be 33.8% for those born from 1936 through 1951.

===Gray===
Like blue eyes, gray eyes have a dark epithelium at the back of the iris and a relatively clear stroma at the front. One possible explanation for the difference in the appearance of gray and blue eyes is that gray eyes have larger deposits of collagen in the stroma, so that the light that is reflected from the epithelium undergoes Mie scattering (which is not strongly frequency-dependent) rather than Rayleigh scattering (in which shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more). This would be analogous to the change in the color of the sky, from the blue given by the Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by small gas molecules when the sky is clear, to the gray caused by Mie scattering of large water droplets when the sky is cloudy. Alternatively, it has been suggested that gray and blue eyes might differ in the concentration of melanin at the front of the stroma.

Gray eyes can also be found among the Algerian Shawia people of the Aurès Mountains in Northwest Africa, in the Middle East/West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. Under magnification, gray eyes exhibit small amounts of yellow and brown color in the iris.

== Irritation ==
Eye irritation has been defined as &quot;the magnitude of any stinging, scratching, burning, or other irritating sensation from the eye&quot;. It is a common problem experienced by people of all ages. Related eye symptoms and signs of irritation are discomfort, dryness, excess tearing, itchiness, grating, foreign body sensation, ocular fatigue, pain, soreness, redness, swollen eyelids, and tiredness, etc. These eye symptoms are reported with intensities from mild to severe. It has been suggested that these eye symptoms are related to different causal mechanisms, and symptoms are related to the particular ocular anatomy involved.

Several suspected causal factors in our environment have been studied so far. One hypothesis is that indoor air pollution may cause eye and airway irritation. Eye irritation depends somewhat on destabilization of the outer-eye tear film, i.e. the formation of dry spots on the cornea, resulting in ocular discomfort. Occupational factors are also likely to influence the perception of eye irritation. Some of these are lighting (glare and poor contrast), gaze position, reduced blink rate, limited number of breaks from visual tasking, and a constant combination of accommodation, musculoskeletal burden, and impairment of the visual nervous system. Another factor that may be related is work stress. In addition, psychological factors have been found in multivariate analyses to be associated with an increase in eye irritation among VDU users. Other risk factors, such as chemical toxins/irritants (e.g. amines, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, N-Decane, VOCs, ozone, pesticides and preservatives, allergens, etc.) might cause eye irritation as well.

Certain volatile organic compounds that are both chemically reactive and airway irritants may cause eye irritation. Personal factors (e.g. use of contact lenses, eye make-up, and certain medications) may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms. Nevertheless, if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause eye irritation, their content of surface-active compounds must be high. An integrated physiological risk model with blink frequency, destabilization, and break-up of the eye tear film as inseparable phenomena may explain eye irritation among office workers in terms of occupational, climate, and eye-related physiological risk factors.

There are two major measures of eye irritation. One is blink frequency, which can be observed by human behavior. The other measures are break up time, tear flow, hyperemia (redness, swelling), tear fluid cytology, and epithelial damage (vital stains) etc., which are human beings&#x27; physiological reactions. Blink frequency is defined as the number of blinks per minute and it is associated with eye irritation. Blink frequencies are individual with mean frequencies of &lt; 2–3 to 20–30 blinks/minute, and they depend on environmental factors including the use of contact lenses. Dehydration, mental activities, work conditions, room temperature, relative humidity, and illumination all influence blink frequency. Break-up time (BUT) is another major measure of eye irritation and tear film stability. It is defined as the time interval (in seconds) between blinking and rupture. BUT is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well. In normal persons, the break-up time exceeds the interval between blinks, and, therefore, the tear film is maintained. Studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with break-up time. This phenomenon indicates that perceived eye irritation is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch. Other evaluating methods, such as hyperemia, cytology etc. have increasingly been used to assess eye irritation.

There are other factors that are related to eye irritation as well. Three major factors that influence the most are indoor air pollution, contact lenses and gender differences. Field studies have found that the prevalence of objective eye signs is often significantly altered among office workers in comparisons with random samples of the general population. These research results might indicate that indoor air pollution has played an important role in causing eye irritation. There are more and more people wearing contact lens now and dry eyes appear to be the most common complaint among contact lens wearers. Although both contact lens wearers and spectacle wearers experience similar eye irritation symptoms, dryness, redness, and grittiness have been reported far more frequently among contact lens wearers and with greater severity than among spectacle wearers. Studies have shown that incidence of dry eyes increases with age, especially among women. Tear film stability (e.g. tear break-up time) is significantly lower among women than among men. In addition, women have a higher blink frequency while reading. Several factors may contribute to gender differences. One is the use of eye make-up. Another reason could be that the women in the reported studies have done more VDU work than the men, including lower grade work. A third often-quoted explanation is related to the age-dependent decrease of tear secretion, particularly among women after 40 years of age.

In a study conducted by UCLA, the frequency of reported symptoms in industrial buildings was investigated. The study&#x27;s results were that eye irritation was the most frequent symptom in industrial building spaces, at 81%. Modern office work with use of office equipment has raised concerns about possible adverse health effects. Since the 1970s, reports have linked mucosal, skin, and general symptoms to work with self-copying paper. Emission of various particulate and volatile substances has been suggested as specific causes. These symptoms have been related to sick building syndrome (SBS), which involves symptoms such as irritation to the eyes, skin, and upper airways, headache and fatigue.

Many of the symptoms described in SBS and multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) resemble the symptoms known to be elicited by airborne irritant chemicals. A repeated measurement design was employed in the study of acute symptoms of eye and respiratory tract irritation resulting from occupational exposure to sodium borate dusts. The symptom assessment of the 79 exposed and 27 unexposed subjects comprised interviews before the shift began and then at regular hourly intervals for the next six hours of the shift, four days in a row. Exposures were monitored concurrently with a personal real time aerosol monitor. Two different exposure profiles, a daily average and short term (15 minute) average, were used in the analysis. Exposure-response relations were evaluated by linking incidence rates for each symptom with categories of exposure.

Acute incidence rates for nasal, eye, and throat irritation, and coughing and breathlessness were found to be associated with increased exposure levels of both exposure indices. Steeper exposure-response slopes were seen when short term exposure concentrations were used. Results from multivariate logistic regression analysis suggest that current smokers tended to be less sensitive to the exposure to airborne sodium borate dust.

Several actions can be taken to prevent eye irritation—
* trying to maintain normal blinking by avoiding room temperatures that are too high; avoiding relative humidities that are too high or too low, because they reduce blink frequency or may increase water evaporation.
* trying to maintain an intact film of tears by the following actions:
:# Blinking and short breaks may be beneficial for VDU users. Increasing these two actions might help maintain the tear film.
:# Downward gazing is recommended to reduce ocular surface area and water evaporation.
:# The distance between the VDU and keyboard should be kept as short as possible to minimize evaporation from the ocular surface area by a low direction of the gaze, and
:#Blink training can be beneficial.

In addition, other measures are proper lid hygiene, avoidance of eye rubbing, and proper use of personal products and medication. Eye make-up should be used with care.

== Disease ==

There are many diseases, disorders, and age-related changes that may affect the eyes and surrounding structures.

As the eye ages, certain changes occur that can be attributed solely to the aging process. Most of these anatomic and physiologic processes follow a gradual decline. With aging, the quality of vision worsens due to reasons independent of diseases of the aging eye. While there are many changes of significance in the non-diseased eye, the most functionally important changes seem to be a reduction in pupil size and the loss of accommodation or focusing capability (presbyopia). The area of the pupil governs the amount of light that can reach the retina. The extent to which the pupil dilates decreases with age, leading to a substantial decrease in light received at the retina. In comparison to younger people, it is as though older persons are constantly wearing medium-density sunglasses. Therefore, for any detailed visually guided tasks on which performance varies with illumination, older persons require extra lighting. Certain ocular diseases can come from sexually transmitted infections such as herpes and genital warts. If contact between the eye and area of infection occurs, the STI can be transmitted to the eye.

With aging, a prominent white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea called arcus senilis. Aging causes laxity, downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat. These changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as ectropion, entropion, dermatochalasis, and ptosis. The vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction (posterior vitreous detachment or PVD) and its opacities — visible as floaters — gradually increase in number.

Eye care professionals, including ophthalmologists and optometrists, are involved in the treatment and management of ocular and vision disorders. A Snellen chart is one type of eye chart used to measure visual acuity. At the conclusion of a complete eye examination, the eye doctor might provide the patient with an eyeglass prescription for corrective lenses. Some disorders of the eyes for which corrective lenses are prescribed include myopia (near-sightedness), hyperopia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (the loss of focusing range during aging).

=== Macular degeneration ===

Macular degeneration is especially prevalent in the U.S. and affects roughly 1.75 million Americans each year. Having lower levels of lutein and zeaxanthin within the macula may be associated with an increase in the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Lutein and zeaxanthin act as antioxidants that protect the retina and macula from oxidative damage from high-energy light waves. As the light waves enter the eye, they excite electrons that can cause harm to the cells in the eye, but they can cause oxidative damage that may lead to macular degeneration or cataracts. Lutein and zeaxanthin bind to the electron free radical and are reduced rendering the electron safe. There are many ways to ensure a diet rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, the best of which is to eat dark green vegetables including kale, spinach, broccoli and turnip greens. Nutrition is an important aspect of the ability to achieve and maintain proper eye health. Lutein and zeaxanthin are two major carotenoids, found in the macula of the eye, that are being researched to identify their role in the pathogenesis of eye disorders such as age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.

== Sexuality ==
Human eyes (particularly the iris and its color) and the area surrounding the eye (lids, lashes, brows) have long been a key component of physical attractiveness. Eye contact plays a significant role in human nonverbal communication. A prominent limbal ring (dark ring around the iris of the eye) is considered attractive. Additionally, long and full eyelashes are coveted as a sign of beauty and are considered an attractive facial feature. Pupil size has also been shown to play an influential role in attraction and nonverbal communication, with dilated (larger) pupils perceived to be more attractive. It should also be noted that dilated pupils are a response to sexual arousal and stimuli. In the Renaissance, women used the juice of the berries of the belladonna plant in eyedrops to dilate the pupils and make the eyes appear more seductive.

<doc id="1070225" wikidata="Q4714239" url="?curid=1070225" title="Alec Peterson">
<text>Alexander Duncan Campbell Peterson OBE (13 September 1908 – 17 October 1988) was a British teacher and headmaster, greatly responsible for the birth of the International Baccalaureate educational system. He was instrumental in the formation of the International Baccalaureate Organisation in 1968, and served as the organisation&#x27;s first director-general until 1977. He was also the first honorary member of the organisation&#x27;s Council of Foundation from 1983 until his death in 1988.

== Early life and career ==
Peterson was the son of John Peterson an Indian Civil Service official and Flora, and was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. His younger, Sir Arthur Peterson, was a civil servant. He attended Radley College and Balliol College, Oxford. After spending two years as a management trainee became a teacher at Shrewsbury School in 1932.

At the beginning of the Second World War he joined the Ministry of Information and joined the propaganda branch of the Special Operations Executive. He played an important role in South-East Asia, and was largely responsible for the Indian Forward Broadcasting Unit, which was very successful in the Burma campaign. He became deputy director of psychological warfare for South-East Asia Command and was awarded OBE in 1946.

After the war he was appointed headmaster at Adams&#x27; Grammar School. He spent two years as Director General, Information Services in Malaya from 1952 to 1954 during the Malayan emergency. He was later headmaster at Dover College, where he set up an international sixth form in 1957. In 1958, he was named head of the Department of Educational Studies at Oxford University, a post he held until 1973. He was the Liberal Party&#x27;s spokesman on education for some time and served as chairman of the Army Education Board for many years.

He married Corinna May Cochrane, daughter of Sir Arthur Cochrane of the College of Arms. Corrie was a member of the Society of Analytical Psychology and was a tutor at Beech Lawn College Oxford during the 1960s. They had two sons and a daughter.

== Work with the IBO ==
In 1962, Peterson&#x27;s connections with the military (he had served in Lord Mountbatten of Burma&#x27;s staff) and his acquaintance with Kurt Hahn earned him a job planning an academic curriculum for the future students of the newly founded Atlantic College in Wales. In 1966, he was named head of the International Schools Examination Syndicate, which was reorganized in 1968 as the International Baccalaureate Organisation.

During the first five years of his time as director-general of the IBO, Peterson continued to live and work in Oxford, despite the fact that the IBO offices were located in Geneva, Switzerland. He remained in his job at Oxford University, retaining the directorial job with the IBO as a part-time work. In 1973, he retired from his Oxford post and took up a part-time teaching job at the Hammersmith and West London College of Further Education, teaching Theory of Knowledge and managing his IBO directorate from London.

Peterson retired in 1977, and he was made an honorary member of the IBO&#x27;s Council of Foundation in 1983. In 1987, he published the book &quot;Schools Across Frontiers: The Story of the International Baccalaureate and the United World Colleges&quot;, a historical account on the development of the IB programmes and the United World Colleges closely linked to them.

Peterson died in 1988. The IBO Cardiff Headquarters building, Peterson House, is named after him.

== Views and contributions ==
Peterson campaigned strongly against what he called &#x27;over-specialisation&#x27; in British pre-university education. In his 1960 report &quot;Arts and Science Sides in the Sixth Form&quot;, he vocally described the need for a new kind of educational system, essentially very similar to what the IB Diploma Programme eventually was to become. The new system would provide broader education for students, while maintaining a certain degree of chances for specialisation. He also emphasised the advantages of examinations and of assessing analytical skills in examinations rather than the ability to remember specific facts.

Peterson is said to have shaped the entire educational philosophy of the IBO, basing it on his own humanist and liberal beliefs on the concept of education. He felt the very purpose of education to be, to stimulate the mind and encourage critical thought, rather than focussing on simple memorisation of detail. His views are reflected in the structure of the IB Diploma Programme, in the way that it incorporates elements such as the Extended Essay, the CAS programme, and Theory of Knowledge: the student is required to do independent research, to participate in meaningful tasks outside the immediate school community to benefit society, and to develop a concrete image on the nature of knowledge that he comes across in his studies.

Despite his assumption of the task of IBO director-general as only a part-time job, Peterson was very productive in advancing the cause of the International Baccalaureate. He continued to be active in developing the IB long after he retired from the director-general&#x27;s post at the IBO. Peterson was viewed as very energetic and devoted to his cause, particularly by his colleague Robert Blackburn, who said:

In 1989, the IBO&#x27;s Council of Foundation established the &#x27;Peterson lectures&#x27; in honour of Alec Peterson. These periodical lectures are held by distinguished scholars on subjects pertaining to international education, in an attempt to search for new solutions and ideas on the subject matter.

<text>Lake Témiscouata () is a lake in the Témiscouata region of southeastern Quebec, Canada. It is 40 km long, with a total area of 66 km2. The Madawaska River flows from this lake to the Saint John River.

The cities of Témiscouata-sur-le-Lac, Dégelis and Saint-Juste-du-Lac are located on this lake. Forestry is a major industry in this area.

The Petit Témis Interprovincial Bicycle Path, runs from Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec to Edmundston, New Brunswick, following an abandoned railway line along the lake.

The lake is theorized to be the inspiration for the nearby parish of Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!. One explanation suggests the archaic French word , here meaning an unexpected obstacle or abruptly ending path, as the lake is an extremely long and particularly formidable obstacle to travel.

<doc id="1070235" wikidata="Q1670259" url="?curid=1070235" title="MOBO Awards">
<text>The MOBO Awards (Music of Black Origin, also known as the MOBOs) are an annual British music award presentation honouring achievements in &quot;music of black origin&quot;, including hip hop, grime, UK Drill, R&amp;B, soul, reggae, jazz, gospel, and African music.

The MOBO Awards were founded by Kanya King and Andy Ruffell. The first ever award was presented to Baby D, in the Best Dance Act category. The inaugural awards were broadcast by Carlton Television from London&#x27;s Connaught Rooms.

In 2009, the ceremony was held for the first time in Glasgow. Prior to that, it had been held in London. In 2011, the ceremony returned for a second time to Scotland. The awards then moved to Leeds for the first time in 2015 and returned there in 2017 before going on hiatus the following year. In 2020 it was confirmed it would be returning later that year, however for the first time ever it would be live streamed on YouTube. For the first time, Sheffield hosted in 2024 with Newcastle announced as the 2025 host city.

Across its history, the MOBOs have been broadcast on Channel 4, BBC Television, ITV2, Channel 5 and BET before returning to the BBC in 2020.

==Ceremonies==
The ceremony was first broadcast regionally on Carlton Television from 1996 to 1997, before airing nationwide on Channel 4 from 1998 until 2003. From 2004 to 2013, they were aired by the BBC; beginning in 2006, the show aired live on BBC Three, and highlights aired on BBC One.

In 2014, the BBC dropped the MOBO Awards, and the ceremony moved to ITV under a three-year deal, airing on ITV2 with same-night highlights on ITV.

In 2017, the ceremony moved to Channel 5 and BET.

In 2018, the MOBO Organisation announced that the ceremony would take a one-year hiatus in order to plan a &quot;bigger, revamped show&quot; in 2019. However, the show did not materialise, with organisers now planning to hold the ceremony in 2020 instead; Kanya King stated that there would be &quot;positive changes&quot; to the show, and that they would be &quot;returning with even more determination and energy to support and boost our culture wherever we can.&quot;

==Criticism==
The MOBOs have faced criticism for having become increasingly oriented towards &quot;commercial&quot; urban music, and having given nominations and awards to musicians who are not black. In 2003, a boycott effort emerged after the American pop musicians Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera won the awards for Best R&amp;B Act and Best Video respectively. &quot;The Independent&quot; described the wins as being the result of the &quot;white appropriation of black music&quot;. A MOBO spokesperson defended their presence, stating that the awards were designed to honour achievements in music of black origin, regardless of the ethnicity of their performers, and cited the increasing worldwide growth of urban music at the time.

In 2006, DJ and music journalist Bigger wrote that the presentation had been &quot;veering away from its concept of rewarding music of black origin&quot; as early as its third edition, noting its increasing dominance by American acts at the expense of domestic acts. He argued that the show had become &quot;little more than a pat on the back and a jolly boys&#x27; outing for major labels and American acts.&quot;

In 2011, Lanre Bakare wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the show was being affected by the music industry&#x27;s dilution of the distinctive black music scene, promoting it to mainstream audiences as popular music (including &quot;manufactured&quot;, U.S.-style hip-hop and R&amp;B). In the column, it was noted that Labrinth had criticized the nominations of Conor Maynard and Ed Sheeran for awards, while Charlie Dark of Attica Blues argued that the MOBOs needed to promote innovation in black music, and &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be an annual event where everyone pats themselves on the back for very small advances that they&#x27;ve made, when they are powerful enough to bring real change. If they don&#x27;t adapt, artists who aren&#x27;t interested in commercial pop and being put in musical boxes will just do their own thing.&quot;

In 2020, English rock duo Nova Twins wrote an open letter on Twitter addressed to the MOBOs concerning the lack of a Rock/Alternative category, despite the fact that many POC have contributed to the evolution of rock music, and still are to this day, and hoping &quot;that a Rock/Alternative category will be added to the MOBO (Music of Black Origin) Awards in 2021, recognising the POC contributors to the genre&quot;. The MOBOS later replied on Twitter that &quot;the MOBO Awards Judging Panel have actually discussed this and ... will continue to review potential category expansions for future Award ceremonies.&quot;

<text>Tilburg University is a Catholic research university specializing in the social and behavioral sciences, economics, law, business sciences, theology and humanities, located in Tilburg in the southern part of the Netherlands.

Tilburg University has a student population of about 19,500 students. Tilburg University has 66 Bachelors &amp; Master&#x27;s programs, of which 43 are offered in English. Tilburg University awards approximately 120 PhDs per year. In 2023, the university had over 92,000 alumni. The university has over 2,900 FTE staff members, of which 56% are academic staff.

==History==
Tilburg University was founded in 1927, as the Roomsch Katholieke Handelshoogeschool (Roman Catholic University of Commerce), being located in the southern, Catholic part of The Netherlands, visible in its second change of name in 1938: Katholieke Economische Hogeschool (Catholic Economic University). In 1963 the university was once again renamed, as Katholieke Hogeschool Tilburg (Catholic University Tilburg), followed by a name change to Katholieke Universiteit Brabant (Catholic University Brabant). Although in its present name Tilburg University, the word Catholic was dropped, the university is still regarded as a Catholic university.

===1969 protests===

On 28 April 1969, students barricaded the campus buildings, demanding educational and organizational changes. Months before students had unofficially renamed the university &quot;Karl Marx University&quot;, painting this title across campus to accentuate the importance of Marxist ideas in the then primarily economics-oriented curriculum. These protests led to a widespread change in higher education across the Netherlands that was made official by the 1971 bill of Educational Reform, granting more joint decision making to students of Dutch universities.
==Rankings==

Tilburg University is a specialised university and has a focus on Social Sciences and Economics. In 2020 three major university rankings (QS World University Ranking, THE World University Rankings and US News Best Global Universities) listed Tilburg among the top 40 in the world and top 10 in Europe for Economics.

In 2020, Tilburg University was ranked 17th worldwide and 4th in Europe in Economics &amp; Business field, by the US News 2020 ranking. Times Higher Education in 2019 ranked it 28th in Economics &amp; Business and 28th in Law globally in the 2021 ranking. The Shanghai Ranking lists Tilburg as the 5th best university in Business Administration in the world, 12th in Finance and 27th in Management.

==Education and research==
Tilburg University has 73 Bachelors &amp; Masters programs, of which 43 in English.

<text>The Buguns (formerly Khowa) are one of the earliest recognized schedule tribes of India, majority of them, inhabiting the Singchung Sub-Division of West Kameng District of Arunachal Pradesh. Buguns live in several exogamous clans. Traditionally, the predominant occupation was agriculture, supported with other allied activities like fishing and hunting, cattle rearing etc. Buguns have their own folklores, songs, dances, music and rituals. A rare bird, the Bugun liocichla, was named after the tribe.

They live mainly in the subtropical Singchung Administrative Sub-Division of West Kameng district with its, almost whole, native population under 6-Thrizino-Buragaon ST Assembly Constituency of the state of Arunachal Pradesh.

==Language==
The Bugun language, one two of the Bugunish/Kamenic language under Kho-Bwa languages is considered endangered by UNESCO, with only around 10,000 speakers mainly concentrated in the Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh, India.

==Religion==
The Buguns are traditionally followers of the animistic religion However, the early 20th century witnessed the gradual penetration of some dominant religions like Buddhism (Mahayana), particularly from the neighbouring ethnic group Sherdukpen, and Hinduism. Some have come under Tibetan Buddhist influence. Profound Buddhist influence has led to the adoption of many Buddhist rituals and the invitation of Buddhist lamas to participate in their communal rituals. As a result, many Buguns declared themselves as Buddhist in censuses.

<text>Szolem Mandelbrojt (10 January 1899 – 23 September 1983) was a Polish-French mathematician who specialized in mathematical analysis. He was a professor at the Collège de France from 1938 to 1972, where he held the Chair of Analytical Mechanics and Celestial Mechanics.

== Biography ==

Szolem Mandelbrojt was born on 10 January 1899 in Warsaw, Poland into a Jewish family of Lithuanian descent. He was initially educated in Warsaw, then in 1919 he moved to Kharkov, Ukraine (then USSR) and spent a year as a student of the Russian mathematician Sergei Bernstein. A year later, he emigrated to France and settled in Paris. In subsequent years, he attended the seminars of Jacques Hadamard, Henri Lebesgue, Émile Picard, and others. In 1923, he received a doctorate from the University of Paris on the analytic continuation of the Taylor series. Hadamard was his Ph.D. advisor.

In 1924 Mandelbrojt was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship in the United States.
In May 1926 he married Gladys Manuelle Grunwald (born 28 June 1904 in Paris).
From 1926 to 1927, he spent a year as an assistant professor at the Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas.

In 1928 he returned to France - having received French citizenship in 1927 – and was appointed an assistant professor at the University of Lille. The following year he became a full professor at the University of Clermont-Ferrand. In December 1934 Mandelbrojt co-founded the Nicolas Bourbaki group of mathematicians, of which he was a member until World War II. He succeeded Hadamard at Collège de France in 1938 and took up the Chair of Analytical Mechanics and Celestial Mechanics.

Mandelbrojt helped several members of his family emigrate from Poland to France in 1936. One of them, his nephew Benoit Mandelbrot, was to discover the Mandelbrot set and coin the word fractal in the 1970s.

In 1939 he fought for France when the country was invaded by the Nazis, then in 1940, along with many scientists helped by Louis Rapkine and the Rockefeller Foundation, Mandelbrojt relocated to the United States, taking up a position at the Rice Institute. In 1944 he joined the scientific committee of the Free French Forces in London, England.

In 1945 Mandelbrojt moved back to France and resumed his professional activities at Collège de France, where he remained until his retirement in 1972. In his retirement year he was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences.

Szolem Mandelbrojt died at the age of 84 in Paris, France, on 23 September 1983.

== Research ==

Even though Mandelbrojt was an early member of the Bourbaki group, and he did take part in a number of Bourbaki gatherings until the breakout of the war, his main research interests were actually quite remote from abstract algebra. As evidenced by his publications (see next), he focused on complex analysis and harmonic analysis, with an emphasis on Dirichlet series, lacunary series, and entire functions.

Rather than a Bourbakist, he is perhaps more accurately described as a follower of G. H. Hardy. Together with Norbert Wiener and Torsten Carleman, he can be viewed as a moderate modernizer of classical Fourier analysis.

Shmuel Agmon, Jean-Pierre Kahane, Yitzhak Katznelson, Paul Malliavin and George Piranian are among his students.

<text>Corinthian-Casuals Football Club is a football club based in Tolworth in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, England. Affiliated to the London Football Association, they are currently members of the and play at King George&#x27;s Field.

==History==
The club was established in 1939 as a merger of amateur clubs Corinthian (founded in 1882) and Casuals (1883). The new club played a single match before football was suspended due to World War II. After the war the club took Casuals&#x27; place in the Isthmian League. In 1953–54 they won the Surrey Senior Cup, beating Epsom 2–0 in the final. Two seasons later they reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup; after a 1–1 draw against Bishop Auckland at Wembley Stadium, the club lost the replay at Ayresome Park 4–1. They reached the semi-finals of the competition the following season, losing 4–2 to Wycombe Wanderers. In 1965–66 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 5–1 at home to Third Division Watford.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw Corinthian-Casuals struggling in the league, finishing bottom in 1968–69 and then for four consecutive seasons between 1970–71 and 1973–74, after which the club were relegated to Division Two, which had been created in 1973. The division was renamed Division One in 1977, and the club were relegated again (to the renamed Division Two) at the end of the 1977–78 season. In 1983–84 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the second time, drawing 0–0 with Fourth Division Bristol City and losing the replay 4–0. At the end of the season the club were excluded from the Isthmian League after new groundsharing rules were introduced, resulting in a drop into the Premier Division of the Spartan League. Their first season in the league saw them relegated to the Senior Division, but they went on to win the division at the first attempt, the club&#x27;s first ever league title, to earn an immediate return to the Premier Division.

In 1988–89 Corinthian-Casuals toured Brazil, which included a match against Corinthians, in which Sócrates played for both teams. In 1994–95 they won the Spartan League Cup. In 1996 the club switched to the Combined Counties League. After finishing as runners-up in their first season in the new league, they returned to the Isthmian League as members of Division Three in 1997. After another tour to Brazil in 2001, league reorganisation in 2002 saw them placed in Division One South. Further reorganisation saw them become members of Division One in 2004 and then Division One South again in 2006. In 2010–11 they won the Surrey Senior Cup for a second time, beating Leatherhead 2–0 in the final. The club returned to Brazil in 2015 to play Corinthians again, with the Brazilian club winning 3–0. In 2016–17 they finished fourth in Division One South, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Greenwich Borough 4–3 in the semi-finals, they lost on penalties to Dorking Wanderers in the final after a 0–0 draw.

The 2017–18 season saw Corinthian-Casuals finish fifth in the division, again reaching the play-offs. They defeated Greenwich Borough 3–0 in the semi-finals, before losing the final 4–2 on penalties to Walton Casuals after the game ended 0–0. Despite the defeat, the club were promoted to the Premier Division after results in other divisions meant that they were the play-off finalists at step 4 with the highest points per game ratio from the season. They were relegated to the South Central Division at the end of the 2022–23 season after finishing second-from-bottom of the Premier Division. The following season saw them finish bottom of the South Central Division, resulting in a second successive relegation, this time to the Premier Division South of the Combined Counties League.

==Ground==
After their formation the club played their first match in the grounds of Lambeth Palace, but after World War II they played at Kingstonian&#x27;s Richmond Road ground, which had previously been used by Casuals. However, they left in 1946 and played at numerous other grounds; the Polytechnic Ground in Chiswick (1946–1950), the Oval (1950–1963; the club played at the Vauxhall End of the ground), Dulwich Hamlet&#x27;s Champion Hill (1963–1968), Tooting &amp; Mitcham United&#x27;s Sandy Lane (1968–1983), Molesey&#x27;s Walton Road (1983–1984 and again from 1986 to 1988) and Wimbledon Park Athletics Stadium (1984–1986).

In 1988 the club merged with Tolworth and took over their King George&#x27;s Field, marking the first time the club had owned their own ground. The ground originally had a running track around the pitch, which was later removed. Covered standing was installed behind both goals and a stand built along one side of the pitch which includes a small section of seating, with the seats coming from Plough Lane, Champion Hill and Havant &amp; Waterlooville&#x27;s Westleigh Park. The ground currently has a capacity of 2,000, of which 250 is seated.

<text>Major Valentine Fleming, (17 February 1882 – 20 May 1917) was a Scottish Conservative Member of Parliament who was killed in the First World War. He was the father of authors Peter Fleming and Ian Fleming, the latter of whom created the James Bond character.

==Early life and political career==
Born in Newport-on-Tay, Fife, Fleming was the son of Sarah (née Hindmarsh) and Robert Fleming, a wealthy Scottish banker and founder of the merchant bank Robert Fleming &amp; Co. Fleming was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. He married Evelyn Beatrice Sainte Croix Rose in London on 15 February 1906. Together they had four sons: adventurer and travel writer Peter (father of actress Lucy Fleming), novelist Ian (author of the James Bond novels), Richard (whose son is billionaire Adam Fleming), and Michael.

From 1906 to 1911, the family lived at Braziers Park in Ipsden, Oxfordshire. On his election to parliament, they moved to Pitt House on Hampstead Heath in 1910. He was a Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 to 1917. In 1916 they built a shooting lodge at Arnisdale, near Glenelg in Inverness-shire in the Scottish Highlands.

==Military service==
At the outbreak of the First World War Valentine was a captain in &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, Queen&#x27;s Own Oxfordshire Hussars, a yeomanry regiment, having received his commission on 30 June 1908. After a month of training the regiment was sent to France on 22 September 1914.

He wrote a &quot;brisk and breezy account&quot; to a fellow officer in England in 1914 about the start of the war. Initially the regiment had little more than &quot;a tour of the principal French watering places&quot; followed by a fortnight hanging about Dunkirk and Saint-Omer (&quot;Very dull&quot;), but then on 30 October were told by General de Lisle to:
 
He also wrote to a close friend, Winston Churchill, in 1914 (the following is an excerpt):

Fleming was promoted to major on 2 November 1914 and became the commanding officer of &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron. He was appointed the second-in-command of the regiment in January 1916.

Fleming was killed by German shellfire at Gillemont Farm, near Épehy, Somme, France on 20 May 1917. For his service, Valentine was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 4 June 1917, having been previously twice mentioned in dispatches. His will was proven on 6 November, with his estate amounting to £265,596 19s. 5d. (roughly equivalent to £ in ).

Fleming is buried at Templeux-le-Guérard British Cemetery, near the village of Templeux-le-Guérard. Fleming is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs that died during World War I to be named on that memorial. Fleming is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of Fleming.

Fleming&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; was written by Churchill.


==Legacy==
In 1914, shortly before leaving to fight in France, Valentine signed a will that left Pitt House and his effects to his wife Evelyn; most of his estate was left in trust to benefit their four sons and their future families. His wife Evelyn would have a generous income from the trust unless she remarried, in which case she would receive a reduced amount of £3000 per annum. Evelyn never remarried and felt it was a &quot;bad will&quot;.

<text>Richard William Brian Harradine (9 January 1935 – 14 April 2014) was an Australian politician who served as an independent member of the Australian Senate, from 1975 to 2005, representing the state of Tasmania. He was the longest-serving independent federal politician in Australian history, and a Father of the Senate.

==Early life==
Harradine was born in Quorn, South Australia, and moved to Tasmania in 1959.

==Political career==
He was an official for the Federated Clerks&#x27; Union. He then served from 1964 to 1976 as Secretary-General of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council and a member of the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

In 1968, the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) refused to let Harradine take his seat on the body. He was suspected of links with the Democratic Labor Party, and had declared that &quot;the friends of the Communists intend to try and silence me&quot;. The Executive&#x27;s actions prompted ALP leader Gough Whitlam, who had supported Harradine, to resign and seek a renewed mandate from the caucus. He was re-elected by a narrow margin, 38 votes to 32, in a ballot against Jim Cairns.

In 1975, the Federal Executive, by a majority of only one vote, expelled Harradine. It subsequently rejected, by the same margin, an attempt to convene a special conference to hear his appeal. The Executive&#x27;s action came after the Tasmanian State Executive declined to expel him. He had been accused of involvement with the National Civic Council.

He decided to contest the 1975 election as an independent for the Senate, and won comfortably. Thereafter, he remained a senator until deciding not to contest the 2004 election. His term expired on 30 June 2005.

From 1993 to 1999, Harradine and Mal Colston were joint Fathers of the Senate. Between 1999 and 2005, Harradine held the title alone.

He was a particularly important figure in the Senate between 1994 and 1999. (See Australian Senate for the Senate numbers.) From December 1994 to March 1996, the make-up of the Senate meant that Harradine&#x27;s vote combined with that of Labor and the Australian Democrats was just enough to pass Labor government legislation, making his support extremely valuable to either side of politics. Then, after the March 1996 election and the resignation from the Labor Party by the disgraced Colston, Harradine&#x27;s and Colston&#x27;s votes were sufficient to pass Coalition legislation, notably the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (also known as the &quot;Wik ten-point plan&quot;) and the partial privatisation of Telstra. He secured $350 million in communications and environmental funding for Tasmania in return for backing the Telstra legislation. However, he refused to support the Goods and Services Tax. After 1 July 1999, the Coalition needed four extra votes to pass Senate legislation so Harradine&#x27;s vote became less important.

He was socially conservative, reflecting his Catholic values. He opposed abortion, embryonic stem cell research, same-sex marriage, and pornography. He secured a ministerial veto on importation of the abortifacient RU486, and a prohibition on Australian overseas aid financing family planning that included abortion advice.

==Death==
He died in April 2014 at his home, in Tasmania, aged 79. He had suffered several strokes prior to his death. Prime Minister Tony Abbott offered Harradine&#x27;s family a state funeral, which was accepted. The funeral was held on 23 April 2014 at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Hobart.

<text>Paveh (Persian and Kurdish: پاوه) is a city in the Central District of Paveh County, Kermanshah province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district. It is in a region called Hawraman.

==History==
An old myth regarding the name of the city is that the Emperor Yazdgerd III sent his son named Pav to this area to renew his religious Zoroastrian faith. Both Persians and the local Gorans practiced Zoroastrianism during the Sasanian Empire from which this myth is derived.

==Demographics==
===Language===
The inhabitants of Paveh are Kurds and speak Hawrami (also: Gorani). They follow the Shafi‘i branch of Sunni Islam. The first language spoken by the population in the city is mostly Gorani language, but the language that is used in schools and offices is Persian, the official language of Iran in which almost everyone in the city is fluent.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 19,774 in 5,171 households. The following census in 2011 counted 23,704 people in 6,723 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 25,771 people in 7,932 households.

== Geography ==

=== Location and topography ===
Paveh is located in western Iran and is 112 km far from Kermanshah. It lies in a sub-region along the Iran-Iraq border commonly referred to as Hewraman, which is situated within the larger geographical region of Kurdistan. The city is considered by inhabitants of the region as the capital of Hewraman.

===Climate===
The town is encircled by fruit gardens. Paveh is situated along a mountainside like most cities and villages in the Hewraman region. Behind the city is the Shaho mountain and ahead of the city is a view of Atashgah, another mountain that was once the site of pilgrimages for ancient religions in the region. Among the most visited places is the Quri Qaleh caveman which is considered as the longest watery cave in the Middle East. The cave is located around 25 kilometers from Paveh&#x27;s city center.

==Landmarks==

===Rivers===

Sirwan River is one of the biggest rivers in Paveh. It rises near Sanandaj, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran. It then descends through the mountains, where for some 32 km it forms the border between the two countries. It finally feeds into the Tigris below Baghdad. Navigation of the upper reaches of the Diyala is not possible because of its narrow defiles, but the river&#x27;s valley provides an important trade route between Iran and Iraq.

=== Mountains ===

Paveh is established among mountains on Zagros Mountains. The mountain chain of Shaho is located in the west of Paveh. Shaho is the highest mountain in Kermanshah with an elevation of 3390.

<text>Javanrud () is a city in the Central District of Javanrud County, Kermanshah province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district. The city is 79 kilometers north of Kermanshah and is 1,300 meters above sea level.

== Etymology ==
The name of the city is derived from the Kurdish Javanrud tribe, which had formerly dominated the area, and which has now become almost fully urban.

== History ==
During its early history, Javanrud was part of the loosely defined Ardalan province, the previous name of the present-day Kurdistan province. In 1909, its &quot;vali&quot; (governor) Aman-Allah Khan Ardalan () ordered the construction of a fortress named Qal&#x27;a-ye Javanrud on a small hill near the middle of the Javanrud. In the mid-1970s, Javanrud was added to the Kermanshah province, later receiving its own sub-province in 1989.

==Demographics==
=== Language, ethnicity, and religion ===
The city is populated by Kurds, from various tribal backgrounds, who adhere to Sunni Islam. However, the Jaff tribe is the main tribe in the city. The two Sufi branches Naqshbandi and Qadiriyya have a strong presence in the city as well. The locals speak Gorani, Sorani and Persian.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 43,104 in 9,591 households. The following census in 2011 counted 51,483 people in 13,043 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 54,354 people in 15,010 households.

<text>In the United Kingdom, there are many &#x27;local authority maintained&#x27; (i.e. state funded) [[Catholic schools|Roman Catholic schools]]. These are theoretically open to pupils of all faiths or none, although if the school is over-subscribed priority will be given to Roman Catholic children.

==History==
During the Reformation, Catholic schools were created on the European continent for the training of children of Catholic families from Britain. During the 18th century, colleges for the training of priests were created in Scotland, such as in Scalan and Lismore Seminary. After the Re-establishment of the English hierarchy and the Scottish hierarchy new schools were created. After the Education Act 1918 in Scotland and the Education Act 1944 in England and Wales, state-funded Catholic schools were built. Nevertheless, today there has been some controversy over Roman Catholic schools. Some Labour backbenchers would like to see them closed along with all other faith-based schools, and this was the official policy of the Scottish Green Party at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. Some local authorities – such as in Lanarkshire – have chosen to build so-called &quot;shared campuses&quot; where a Roman Catholic and non-denominational school share grounds, a building, and facilities such as canteen, sport halls etc., but lessons are taught separately. This policy has had mixed success – although supporters say it reduces the risk of &quot;us and them&quot; sectarianism, some shared campuses have suffered disruptions on opening. At one stage the Scottish Catholic Church even considered legal action against North Lanarkshire Council to stop another &quot;shared campus&quot; being built.

In Northern Ireland, Roman Catholic schools are state-funded and organised and run by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS).

== England and Wales ==

The Catholic Education Service provides the central co-ordination under the Bishops&#x27; Conference for Catholic schools in England and Wales. In England and Wales, Catholic schools come under the jurisdiction of their local diocese who can inspect the religious education and acts of worship of the school under Section 48 of the Education Act 2005. Many schools were also founded by religious orders who continue to maintain a presence, property ownership or trusteeship of their schools.

In England and Wales are joint Anglican and Catholic schools. These include primary schools such as: All Saints, Cambridge; The Bishops’ School, Chelmsford; Emmaus School, Liverpool; The Faith School, Liverpool; St John’s Sunderland; Christ the King, Macclesfield. There is a joint middle school: St Edward’s Royal Free School, Windsor.  Joint secondary schools and academies include: St Cuthbert Mayne School, Torquay; St Augustine, Taunton; St Bede, Cambridge; St Bede, Redhill; St Michael, Barnsley; St Edward, Poole; St Francis Xavier High School, Richmond, North Yorkshire; Emmaus, Sheffield; Holy Family College, Heywood, Rochdale; Christ’s College, Cheltenham; St Francis of Assisi, Liverpool; St Chad’s, Runcorn. In 2006, the first joint Church in Wales and Catholic school was opened in Wales: St Joseph’s, Wrexham.

After the Education Act 1918, many state-funded Scottish Catholic schools were started. Nevertheless, there exist Catholic independent schools such as St Aloysius&#x27; College, Glasgow, Fernhill School, Rutherglen, and Kilgraston School.

<doc id="1070279" wikidata="Q3700567" url="?curid=1070279" title="Istislah">
<text>Istislah (Arabic: استصلاح, ) is a method employed by Islamic jurists to solve problems that find no clear answer in sacred religious texts. It is related to the term مصلحة &quot;Maslaha&quot;, or &quot;public interest&quot; (both words being derived from the same triconsonantal root, &quot;ṣ-l-ḥ&quot;). Extratextual pragmatic considerations are commonly accepted in Islamic jurisprudence concerning areas where the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and the practices of the earliest Muslim generations (&quot;Salaf&quot;) provide no specific guidance.

&quot;Istislah&quot; bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West, as exemplified by Thomas Aquinas. However, whereas natural law deems good that which is known self-evidently to be good, according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person, &quot;istislah&quot; calls good whatever is connected to one of five &quot;basic goods&quot;. Al-Ghazali abstracted these &quot;basic goods&quot; from the five legal precepts in the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and &quot;Sunnah&quot;—religion, life, reason, lineage (or offspring), and property. In this classical formulation, &quot;istislah&quot; differs from utilitarianism—&quot;the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people&quot;—because something that results in &quot;the greatest happiness&quot; may infringe any one of the five basic values. Rather than utilitarianism, Istislah bears closer resemblance to deontologicalism.

The legal concepts of &quot;Istislah&quot; and &quot;Maslaha&quot; attained significant attention in the works of the 20th century Sunni jurist Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā (d. 1354 A.H/ 1935 C.E), who considered the &quot;no harm no retribution&quot; &quot;hadith&quot; to be an important textual principle. Citing the Andalusian Malikite jurist Al-Shatibi (d. 790 A.H/ 1388 C.E), Rida elaborated &quot;Maslaha&quot; as a &quot;basic principle&quot; in legal derivation and distinguished affairs into issues of &quot;&#x27;Ibadat&quot; (rituals) and &quot;Mu&#x27;amalat&quot; (transactions). The former consists of absolute, unchanging rules; while rules regarding issues of &quot;Mu&#x27;amalat&quot; may vary with time since Revelation is not absolute in all of them. However, unlike the expansive scope of &quot;Mu&#x27;amalat&quot; by Al-Shatibi; Rida divided &quot;Mu&#x27;amalat&quot; issues into two types: i) those that are moral norms and ii) those which are morally irrelevant. The former are similar to the &quot;&#x27;Ibadat&quot; rules which were Revealed by God who defined moral norms and hence, fixed. Those who break these rules are sinful transgressors. The latter category of issues, can be solved through the process of &quot;Qiyas&quot;.

In the contemporary era, some human rights are considered &quot;Islamic&quot; using the methods of &quot;Istislah&quot; and &quot;Maslaha&quot;. In Egypt, this approach has been backed by the Supreme Constitutional Court, which has ratified equitable measures benefiting women even where these seemingly conflict with principles of classical &quot;Shari&#x27;ah&quot;.

<text>Cronulla railway station is the heritage-listed terminus railway station on the Cronulla line in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed and built by the NSW Department of Railways during 1939. It is also known as Cronulla Railway Station group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The station serves the Sydney suburb of Cronulla via Sydney Trains&#x27; T4 Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line services. The station is unusual in that the two platforms are situated end to end, rather than side by side, making it the second longest rail platform in New South Wales, after Albury.

==History==
Thomas Holt (1811–88) owned most of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla in the 1860s. Holt built Sutherland House on the foreshore of Gwawley Bay in 1818, on the eastern side of Sylvania. After the Illawarra railway line was built to Sutherland in 1885, the area became popular for picnics and swimming. Many regulars rented beach houses at Cronulla every year for holidays. The Cronulla area was subdivided in 1895 and land was offered for sale at A£10 per acre. In 1899, the government named the area Gunnamatta, which means &quot;sandy hills&quot;. The municipality of Sutherland Shire was proclaimed on 15 March 1906, and the Post Office reopened in 1907. On 26 February 1908 it was officially changed to Cronulla and Gunnamatta was used for the name of the bay, on the western side. The first public school opened in 1910. In 1908, the NSW Government had approved construction of a steam tram route from Sutherland to Cronulla, with construction completed and steam trams operating along the route from 12 June 1911. The area remained mostly semi rural in the inter-war period. After World War II there was a large population increase and the area was suburbanised from the 1950s, with many of the guest houses being replaced by high rise flats.

The Sutherland-Cronulla line was constructed from 1936 and completed in 1939, under the NSW premiership of the conservative Sir Bertram Stevens. In 1936 the NSW Parliament authorised expenditure of A£300,000 to construct the Sutherland to Cronulla railway line, with the men employed to receive award wages &quot;in pursuance of the Cabinet&#x27;s policy of replacing unemployment relief works by works that will provide a better return for the expenditure of public money, and at the same time create improved conditions of employment.&quot; A federal loan for &quot;state works&quot; including &quot;speeding up of the construction of the Sutherland-Cronulla line&quot; was granted to the NSW government in November 1938. The Cronulla line replaced the steam tramway. A single track railway line replaced the tram service, opening on 16 December 1939.

As part of the Cronulla line, five suburban railway stations with Inter-war Functionalist style platform buildings were constructed from Kirrawee to Woolooware (Kirrawee since demolished), and Sutherland Railway Station rebuilt with a pair of Inter-war Functionalist style platform buildings. Cronulla, as the terminus of the line, was regarded as the most important station on the line, and was officially opened on 16 December 1939 by the NSW Governor Lord Wakehurst. The Cronulla terminus was unlike any other railway terminus due to the very long single side loading platform designed to take two full length electric trains end to end. Cronulla was a major tourist resort, and the railway station was constructed close to the ocean beach. The design of the station allowed large crowds to move quickly in and out of the trains and off the platform. A goods siding closed in 1949.

The Cronulla line was constructed as an electrified railway line, and was the first major use of a miniaturised relay locking system using electrical relays for electric light signalling for sections of the line (known as the electro- pneumatic system). Under the Rail Clearways Program, the two remaining single track sections of the Cronulla line were duplicated in 2010. As a result, train stabling west of Cronulla was replaced by stabling sidings opposite platform 2. Cronulla has the second longest platform in New South Wales, after Albury.

== Description ==
The station complex comprises, from south to north, a freestanding brick wall with platform awning and brick ticket booth/entry building, erected in 1939; a brick ticket booth/entry building, erected in 1939; a type 13 main platform building, erected in 1939; and the platform, erected in 1939. The surrounding landscape includes planting beds, embankment plantings, and Monro Park opposite on east. Moveable items include the railway clock to platform; two plaques; and timber roll-over indicator boards.

;Context
Cronulla Railway Station fronts Cronulla Street on the eastern side and was originally entered via three separate entry points along Cronulla Street, each with a 1939 structure. The station has a very long perimeter platform. The main platform building is located towards the northern end of the railway station. The station has some planting beds along the Cronulla Street elevation, and also a railway embankment planting to the western side of the railway tracks. The station is also located opposite Monro Park in Cronulla Street. There is a low brick retaining wall along the Cronulla street side of the platform, above which modern powder coated aluminium fencing has been installed.

;Freestanding brick wall with platform awning and ticket booth/entry building, erected in 1939
A freestanding brick wall with two contrasting soldier courses, and a brick entry building towards its southern end, which features a cantilevered platform awning with steel posts and curved corners. The awning ceiling has the same stepped profile as the awning ceiling to the main platform building. The brick entry building also has curved corners and 2 contrasting soldier courses.

;Entry building/ticket booth, erected in 1939
This is a freestanding brick entry building/ticket booth with curved corners, a low soldier course in contrasting brickwork, and steel framed windows with 2 horizontal glazing bars. It is located opposite (west of) the intersection of Laycock Avenue and Cronulla Street.

;Main platform building, erected in 1939
This is an asymmetrically proportioned brick building, a dramatic and imposing composition of Inter-war Functionalist style design with great visual impact to both the Cronulla Street (east) and platform (west) elevations. The building has 8 stepped bays with shallow pitched gabled roofs hidden behind parapets, curved corners, two soldier courses in contrasting brickwork, curved awnings to both the street and platform elevations of the building, and a flat roofed clock tower facing Cronulla Street. All brickwork is tuck pointed.

A series of stepped, cantilevered steel awnings to the street elevation, including bus shelters at the southern end on the Cronulla Street elevation, add to the architectural interest of the building. The main platform building entrance area is particularly well defined by two sweeping curved walls of bull nosed bricks forming a covered passageway. This entry area has a decorative Art Deco style plaster ceiling with heavily moulded cornices featuring an ocean wave motif, and features a freestanding brick ticket booth with rollover timber indicator board. The station entry area also features a brass plaque commemorating the official opening of the station in 1939.

The building has original steel framed awning windows placed in groups of three vertically and flywire fanlights. There are many original timber perimeter beaded doors. There are cantilevered steel posts with concrete bases to the platform awning. The awning ceiling has fluorescent strip lighting. There is a luggage store door bricked up. On the Cronulla Street (east) side of the main platform building there are some modern aluminium framed windows, and modern glazed doors with roller shutters. The Countrylink Travel Centre located to the north of the entry area on the street (east) elevation has modern aluminium framed glazed doors. At the far northern end of the building, opening onto both the platform and the street, is a shop, which is contained within the curved northern end of the building. There are original flat concrete awnings over the shop entry and the window on the street side of the shop. There is a 1989 plaque on the Cronulla Street (east) side, near the station entry, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cronulla Station unveiled by the Hon. Bruce Baird on 16 December 1989.

The interior of the building comprises a complex arrangement of discrete spaces that are defined by the curving walls of each bay, resulting in asymmetrical and unusually proportioned rooms. These spaces comprise (from north to south): a men&#x27;s toilet, store room, ladies&#x27; toilet, ladies&#x27; waiting room (now a staff room), signal equipment room, general waiting room, booking hall (entrance), booking office, Station Master&#x27;s office, public waiting area, parcels office, traffic staff room and drivers room. The final bay (northern end) is let as a shop. Cronulla Station retains a significant proportion of original interior fit out. Although some fit out has been removed, the bulk of interior joinery, doors and window frames have been retained along with the original signalling/track switching gear, which is still in everyday use. The waiting room has original seating. Interior ceilings to the shop at the far northern end of the main platform building are original.

;Platform, erected in 1939
A single very long platform with an asphalt surface and concrete edges. The platform is the second longest in NSW.

;Modern canopies
There are two separate modern cantilevered canopies on steel posts on the Cronulla Street (east) side of the station, towards the southern end, off the station platform.

;Landscape/Natural features
There are planting beds on both east and west sides of the station, with linear exotic planting on the rail embankment including palm trees. The visual setting includes Monro Park opposite on the east. The original building was planned with extensive gardens to the street elevation, however 1943 aerial photos do not show extensive planting.

;Moveable items
* Double-faced clock mounted on a cast iron wall bracket on the platform (west) elevation of the main platform building;
* Plaque within entry area to main platform building to commemorate the 1939 official opening of the station;
* Plaque on east elevation of main platform building, near entry area, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cronulla Station, unveiled by the Hon. Bruce Baird on 16 December 1989;
* Timber roll-over indicator boards attached to the entry area ticket booth in the Main platform building.

=== Condition ===
The freestanding brick wall with platform awning and brick entry building is in good condition. The brick entry building/ticket booth is also in good condition. Also in good condition are the main platform building, the platform, the surrounding landscape, and the moveable items.

<text>St Ninian&#x27;s High School is a six-year co-educational Roman Catholic state high school in Giffnock, East Renfrewshire, Scotland. The school, which opened in 1984, serves Giffnock, Clarkston, Thornliebank, Newton Mearns, Eaglesham, Netherlee, Waterfoot, Netherplace, Millhall and Busby in East Renfrewshire. The school roll was 1,714 as of September 2005, but has now risen to more than 2000 due to the schools academic success. The head teacher is Gerry O’Neil. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Floreat Iuventus&quot; which translates as &quot;Let youth flourish&quot;.

==History==
Between 2000 and 2002, a multi-million pound extension was built for the school (which was originally designed to hold only 700 pupils). The extension had been scheduled for years earlier (and completion by 1999 at the latest) however problems with the PFI tender for another local school project caused years of delay. Another extension was completed in 2009.

In 2008, the school was given the best inspection report which at that time had been given to a Scottish secondary school, seven &quot;excellents&quot; and 10 &quot;very goods&quot;.

The school was the first public-sector organisation to win the &#x27;Quality Scotland&#x27; business excellence award;

It was the first state-funded school in Scotland to abandon the Standard Grade examination system in favour of the Higher Still system, using Access 3, Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 for pupils in third and fourth year, while maintaining &quot;Highers&quot; in fifth year and Advanced Highers in S6.

<doc id="1070293" wikidata="Q649585" url="?curid=1070293" title="Fair Warning (Van Halen album)">
<text>Fair Warning is the fourth studio album by American rock band Van Halen. Released on April 29, 1981, by Warner Bros. Records, the album peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while the single &quot;So This Is Love?&quot; failed to reach &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 110 on the Bubbling-Under list. The album sold more than two million copies in the United States, but was still the band&#x27;s slowest-selling album of the David Lee Roth era. Despite the album&#x27;s commercially disappointing sales, &quot;Fair Warning&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews from critics. It was listed by &quot;Esquire&quot; as one of the &quot;75 Albums Every Man Should Own&quot;.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover artwork features a detail from &quot;The Maze&quot;, a painting by Canadian artist William Kurelek, which depicts his tortured youth.

The album&#x27;s cover artwork is accompanied by an insert of a black-and-white portrait of the members of the band, in addition to another black-and-white photo of an exterior wall featuring cracked windows and a lyric from the album&#x27;s opening song &quot;Mean Street&quot; in handwritten graffiti. This second photo was taken by famed rock photographer Neil Zlozower.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Robert Christgau rated &quot;Fair Warning&quot; a B−, signifying &quot;a competent or mildly interesting record usually featuring at least three worthwhile cuts.&quot; It featured &quot;not just Eddie&#x27;s latest sound effects, but a few good jokes along with the mean ones and a rhythm section that can handle punk speed emotionally and technically.&quot; He also explained &quot;at times Eddie could even be said to play an expressive – lyrical? – role. Of course, what he&#x27;s expressing is hard to say. Technocracy putting a patina on cynicism&quot;.

A retrospective review by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine found the album fairly positive. In the review, he initially stated &quot;it&#x27;s a dark, strange beast, partially because it lacks any song as purely fun as the hits from the first three records&quot; and &quot;whatever the reason, &quot;Fair Warning&quot; winds up as a dark, dirty, nasty piece of work [...] Dull it is not and &quot;Fair Warning&quot; contains some of the fiercest, hardest music Van Halen ever made. There&#x27;s little question Eddie Van Halen won whatever internal skirmishes they had, [...] even with the lack of a single dedicated instrumental showcase.&quot;

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, however, gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that &quot;the most significant musical development is the synthesizer introduced at the end of &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, which would be exploited to greater effect on later albums.&quot;

<text>In Islam, the terms &#x27; (; , ) and &#x27; (; ) are primarily used to refer to pre-Islamic Arabians who were Abrahamic monotheists. These people are regarded favorably for shunning Arabian polytheism and instead solely worshipping the God of Abraham, thus setting themselves apart from what is called . However, they were not associated with Judaism or Christianity; instead exemplifying what they perceived as the unaltered beliefs and morals of Abraham. The word is found 12 times in the Quran: 10 times in the singular form and twice in the plural. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad himself was a (before he met the angel Gabriel) and a direct descendant of Abraham&#x27;s eldest son Ishmael. Likewise, all Islamic prophets and messengers before Muhammad—that is, those affiliated with Judaism and/or Christianity, such as Moses and Jesus—are considered to underscore their God-given infallibility.

==Etymology==
The term comes from the Arabic root meaning &quot;to incline, to decline&quot; or &quot;to turn or bend sideways&quot; from the Syriac root of the different meaning “to deceive, to turn pagan, to lead into paganism”. The Syriac word refers to pagans and deceivers. The Arabic is defined as &quot;true believer, orthodox; one who scorns the false creeds surrounding him/her and profess the true religion&quot; by The Arabic-English &quot;Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic&quot;.

According to Francis Edward Peters, in verse of the Quran it has been translated as &quot;upright person&quot; and outside the Quran as &quot;to incline towards a right state or tendency&quot;. According to W. Montgomery Watt, it appears to have been used earlier by Jews and Christians in reference to &quot;pagans&quot; and applied to followers of an old Hellenized Syrian and Arabian religion and used to taunt early Muslims.

Michael Cook states &quot;its exact sense is obscure&quot; but the Quran &quot;uses it in contexts suggestive of a pristine monotheism, which it tends to contrast with (latter-day) Judaism and Christianity&quot;. In the Quran is associated &quot;strongly with Abraham, but never with Moses or Jesus&quot;. The unique association of ḥanīf with Abraham underscores his foundational role in the development of monotheistic faith and his exemplary status in the Islamic tradition.

Oxford Islamic Studies online defines as &quot;one who is utterly upright in all of his or her affairs, as exemplified by the model of Abraham&quot;; and that prior to the arrival of Islam &quot;the term was used [...] to designate pious people who accepted monotheism but did not join the Jewish or Christian communities.&quot;

Others translate as the law of Ibrahim; the verb as &quot;to turn away from [idolatry]&quot;. Others maintain that the followed the &quot;religion of Ibrahim, the , the Muslim[.]&quot; It has been theorized by Watt that the verbal term &quot;Islam&quot;, arising from the participle form of &quot;Muslim&quot; (meaning &quot;surrendered to God&quot;), may have only arisen as an identifying descriptor for the religion in the late Medinan period.

==Historicity==
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;there is no evidence that a true cult existed in pre-Islamic Arabia.&quot;

A Greek source from the 5th century CE, &quot;The Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen&quot;, speaks of how &quot;Abraham had bequeathed a monotheist religion&quot; to the Arabs, who are described being descended &quot;from Ishmael and Hagar&quot; and adhering to certain practices of the Jews, such as shunning pork consumption.

Sozomen, a 5th-century Roman lawyer and historian of the Christian Church, is thought to have been a native of Gaza City and a native speaker of Arabic Therefore, according to Ibn Rawandi, he provides a &quot;reliable source&quot; that Arabs—at least in northwest Arabia—were familiar with the idea there were pre-Islamic &quot;Abrahamic monotheists () [...] whether this was true of Arabs throughout the [Arabian] peninsula it is impossible to say.&quot;

Yehuda Nevo, a revisionist Islamic historian which has called into question several aspects of the traditional islamic narrative, interprets the Hanif movement as part of a broader pre-Islamic monotheistic trend in Arabia that eventually morphed into what he names Mohammadian Islam following the Islamic conquests.

==List of Arabian monotheists==
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, &quot;some of Muḥammad&#x27;s relatives, contemporaries, and early supporters were called &quot; – examples including Waraqah ibn Nawfal, &quot;a cousin of the Prophet’s first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, and Umayyah ibn Abī aṣ-Ṣalt, &quot;an early 7th-century Arab poet&quot;.

According to the website &quot;In the Name of Allah&quot;, the term is used &quot;twelve times in the Quran&quot;, but Abraham/Ibrahim is &quot;the only person to have been explicitly identified with the term.&quot; He is mentioned &quot;in reference to&quot; eight times in the Quran.

Among those who are thought to have been are:

*All the prophets and messengers after Abraham according to Islamic tradition
*Muhammad
*Old Najranites
*Seven Sleepers
*Sa&#x27;id bin Zayd
*Khaled bin Sinan
*Hashim ibn Abd Manaf
*Umayya ibn Abi as-Salt

The four friends in Mecca from ibn Ishaq&#x27;s account:

*Zayd ibn Amr: rejected both Judaism and Christianity
*Waraqah ibn Nawfal: was a Nestorian priest and patrilineal third cousin to Muhammad. He died before Muhammad declared his Prophethood.
*Uthman ibn al-Huwayrith: travelled to the Byzantine Empire and converted to Christianity
*Ubayd-Allah ibn Jahsh: early Muslim convert who emigrated to the Kingdom of Aksum.

 opponents of Islam from Ibn Isḥāq&#x27;s account:

*Abū &#x27;Amar &#x27;Abd Amr ibn Sayfī: a leader of the tribe of Banu Aws at Medina and builder of the &quot;Mosque of the Schism&quot; mentioned in the Quranic verse and later allied with the Quraysh then moved to Ta&#x27;if and onto Syria after subsequent early Muslim conquests.
*Abu Qays ibn al-Aslaṭ

<text>Shaki (, ) is a city in northwestern Azerbaijan, surrounded by the district of the same name. It is located in the southern part of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, from Baku. As of 2020, it has a population of 68,400. The center of the city and the Palace of Shaki Khans were inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2019 because of their unique architecture and history as an important trading center along the Silk Road.

== Etymology ==
According to the Azerbaijani historians, the name of the town goes back to the ethnonym of the Sakas, who reached the territory of modern-day Azerbaijan in the 7th century B.C. and populated it for several centuries.
In the medieval sources, the name of the town is found in various forms such as Sheke, Sheki, Shaka, Shakki, Shakne, Shaken, Shakkan, Shekin.

The city was known as &quot;Nukha&quot; (; ) until 1968.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
There are traces of large-scale settlements in Shaki dating back to more than 2700 years ago. The Sakas were an Iranian people that wandered from the north side of the Black Sea through Derbend passage and to the South Caucasus and from there to Asia Minor in the 7th century B.C. They occupied a good deal of the fertile lands in South Caucasus in an area called Sakasena. The city of Shaki was one of the areas occupied by the Sakas. The original settlement dates back to the late Bronze Age.

Shaki was founded in the 8th century B.C. Shaki was one of the biggest cities of the Caucasian Albanian states in the 1st century. The kingdom of Shaki was divided into 11 administrative provinces. The main temple of the ancient Albanians was located there. The Albanians adopted Christianity early from the Armenians, and Armenian cultural and religious influence became strong in Shaki.

As a result of archaeological excavations conducted in 1902 in the village of Boyuk-Dakhna in the Shaki region, various ceramic products and a stone tombstone dating back to the 2nd century AD and containing inscriptions in Greek were discovered.

Shaki was one of the important political and economic cities before the Arab invasion. But as a result of the invasion in 654, Shaki was annexed to the third emirate of Arminiya. At the turn of the 9th century, when the Arab caliphate was weak, Shaki joined with Cambysene and was ruled by the Armenian Smbatean princes as part of the independent principality of Shaki or Hereti, a vassal of the Armenian Bagratid kingdom. The population was mostly of Armenian origin and Armenian-speaking. The first Armenian prince of Shaki was Sahl Smbatean, who ruled with relative autonomy from the Abbasid Caliphate. By the 10th century, the Arab geographer, Ibn Haukal mentions that Shaki was ruled by the Armenian prince Prince Ishkhanik. From 1038 to 1105, the Armenian Kiurikian dynasty ruled Shaki as part of the Kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti. In 1117, the region was captured by the army of the Georgian king David IV. 

The city was also ruled by the Atabegs of Azerbaijan and the Khwarazmian Empire, before the Mongol invasion.

===Feudal era===

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the territory of the present Shaki district was a part of the state of Shirvanshahs. Management of Shaki was entrusted to the son of Rashid al-Din Hamadani – Jalat In the 30s of the 14th century, the local Oirat tribe took power. After the collapse of the Hulagu Khan&#x27;s rule in the first half of the 14th century, Shaki gained independence under the rule of Sidi Ahmed Orlat. In 1392, Emir Timur captured Shaki, and the ruler of Shaki, Seyid Ali, was killed. Seyid Ali&#x27;s son, Seyid Ahmed, who came to power, along with Shirvanshah Ibrahim I Derbendi, accompanied Timur on his third campaign against Azerbaijan in 1399. In 1444, Shaki, then known as Nukhi, was ruled by a Muslim family of Armenian origin whose reign lasted till 1551. In the early 1500s, Safavid king Ismail I (r. 1501–1524) conquered the area, but the town continued to be governed by its hereditary rulers, under Safavid suzerainty.

Ismail&#x27;s son and successor Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524–1576) put an end to this, and in 1551, he appointed the first Qizilbash governor to rule the town. The territory was annexed to the Safavid dynasty as the independent Sheki beylerbey reigned by Toygun-bey Qajar. Safavid rule was twice briefly interrupted by the Ottomans between 1578 and 1603 and 1724–1735. In 1734-1735, there was a revolt of poor people against the policy of Nadir Shah in the village of Bilecik (Shaki)

In 1741, there was another uprising against the local ruler, Melik Najaf. Appointed by Nadir Shah, Haji Chelebi, who claimed descent from the hereditary Muslim-Armenian rulers of the province, announced the formation of an independent Sheki khanate in 1743. Upon learning of this, Nadir Shah Afshar sent his army to Shaki. Haji Chelebi took refuge in the fortress of Gelesen-Geresen. In 1746, Haji Celebi was forced to recognize the authority of Nadir Shah. However, new uprisings and the death of Nadir Shah allowed Haji Chelebi to re-declare himself Khan During the existence of Shaki khanate, the local population of the city was engaged in silkworm breeding, craft and trade. As a result of a flood in the river Kish, the city of Shaki was partially ruined and the population was resettled in the present day city.

In alliance with the Shamakhi Khan, in 1748 Haji Chelebi attempted to besiege the Bayat fortress. The defeat in the battle of Bayat, which lasted for a month, had been a serious setback for allies.

The Jaro-Balakan Jamaat, Qabala and Ares sultanates were dependent on the Shaki khanate

In 1751, Haji Chelebi defeated the army of the Kakheti king Heraclius II. At the initiative of Heraclius II, a political conspiracy of the Kakheti Kingdom, the Karabakh, Ganja, Irevan, Nakhichevan, and Karadag khanates against the Shaki khan was arranged. In 1752, in the area of Kyzylgaya, Georgian troops unexpectedly attacked the khans: they were captured. Haji Celebi himself defeated the Georgians in the battle near Ganja and came to the aid of the khans. The army of Shaki khan captured Gazakh and Borchali.

In 1767, the Western part of the Shamakhi khanate was annexed to the Shaki khanate.

In 1785, the Shaki khanate became dependent on the Guba khanate. However, this did not last long: after the death of Fatali khan of Guba, the Shaki khanate regained its independence.

During the reign of Selim khan, the territory of the khanate was conditionally divided into 8 magals, which were ruled by naibs directly appointed by the khan himself.

On May 21, 1805, the treaty of Kyurekchay was signed between Russia and the Shaki khanate, the main condition of which was the annexation of the Shaki khanate to Russia. In 1806, the Russian army moved to Shaki. Selim khan was removed from positions of power. A temporary Board of Pro-Russian beks was created.

===Modern era===
The area was fully annexed by Russia by the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813 and the khanate was abolished in 1819 and the Shaki province was established in its place. Shaki province was merged with provinces of Shemakha, Baku, Susha, Lankaran, Derbent and Kuban in 1840 and Caspian Oblast was created. At the same time Shaki was renamed as Nuha. The oblast was dissolved in 1846 and it was raion center of Shemakha Governorate. After the earthquake in Shemakha in 1859, the governorate was renamed as Baku Governorate. On 19 February 1868, raion of Nukha was passed to the newly created Elizavetpol Governorate as the Nukha uezd. After founding of USSR, it was the center of Nukha raion. Its one was abolished on 4 January 1963 and was bounded to one of Vartashen. Nukha one was founded again in 1965 and finally, city and raion regained traditional name in 1968.

During its history, the town saw devastation many times and because of that, the oldest historic and architectural monuments currently preserved are dated to only the 16th–19th centuries. For many centuries, Shaki had a large Armenian community and has been famous for being the center of silkworm-breeding and local silk production. Originally located on the left bank of the river Kish, the town sat lower down the hill, however Shaki was moved to its present location after a devastating flood in 1772 and became the capital of Shaki Khanate. As the new location was near the village of Nukha, the city also became known as Nukha, until 1968 when it reverted to the name Shaki.

In 1829, the Khanabad factory was opened in Shaki. The products of the Nukha silk-winding factory, which opened in 1861, were awarded a medal in London in 1862. The Shaki uprising of 1838 had an impact on the administrative, judicial, and agrarian reforms of the 1840s.

In 1917, Soviets of Workers&#x27; deputies were formed in a number of cities of Azerbaijan, including Shaki.

In May 1920, Soviet power was established in Shaki, as well as in other cities of Azerbaijan.

In 1930, an uprising against the policy of collectivization in the Azerbaijan SSR broke out in the village of Bash Goynyuk in the Shaki district. The Soviet regime was abolished. Soon, Red Army units moved into the city. The rebels were subject to execution.

<text>The Hemshin people (, ; ), also known as Hemshinli or Hamshenis or Homshetsi, are a bilingual ethnographic group of Armenians who mostly practice Sunni Islam after their conversion from Christianity in the beginning of the 18th century and are affiliated with the Hemşin and Çamlıhemşin districts in the province of Rize, Turkey.

They are Armenian in origin, and were originally Christians and members of the Armenian Apostolic Church, but evolved into a distinct community over the centuries and converted to Sunni Islam after the conquest of the region by the Ottomans during the second half of the 15th century. In Turkey, Hemshin people do not speak the Homshetsi dialect apart from the &quot;Eastern Hamsheni&quot; group living in provinces of Artvin and Sakarya and their mother tongue is now Turkish.

For centuries, the ongoing migration from the geographically isolated highlands to lowlands made the Hemshin people settle in the areas near Trabzon, Artvin and in the Western part of the Black Sea coast. Thus, a significant Hamsheni population formed in those areas.

==History==
===Genetic Origin===
The origins of the Hemshin people has remained a subject of debate among scholars. The main two purported homelands of the Hemshin have been Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia. A 2011 genetic survey based on the Y-chromosomal markers of the Hemshin indicated the central part of the historical Armenian highlands as a plausible place of origin for the Hamsheni population.

===History until the Ottoman conquest===
The region of Hemshin is located on the coast of the Black sea, in the highlands of Rize Province. According to historical accounts, Armenians first settled in that region in the end of 8th century. While escaping Arab persecutions, about 12,000 Armenians led by Prince Shapuh Amatuni and his son Hamam moved to Pontos, ruled by Byzantine Empire. Robert H. Hewsen shows the region where today&#x27;s Hemşin is located to be populated by a people with different designations throughout the ancient and early medieval history. He indicates thereby that some designations may have alternative forms and partially presents the names used with question marks. In summary from 13th century to 6th century BC Colchians, 550 to 330 BC Colchians and Macrones, 180 BC to 14 AD Lazoi (Chani/Tzan tribes), in the Arsacid Period (63–298 AD) Heniochi, Machelones, Heptakometians, Mossynoeci as well as Sanni, Drilae and Macrones are mentioned.

The Hemşin region is shown as part of Colchis (299–387), Tzanica (387–591) and Chaldia (654–750). The specific location of Hemşin is indicated as Tambur/Hamamašen as a fort and town for the first time in the map covering the period 654–750.

Those two names (Tambur and Hamamašen) are included in the &quot;History of Taron&quot; by John Mamikonean in a short passage about a war between the ruler of Tambur, Hamam, and his maternal uncle the Georgian Prince, which resulted in the destruction of the town to be rebuilt by Hamam and be named after him, namely Hamamshen.

This event is declared by Mamikonian to have taken place in early seventh century. Hamamashen became Hamshen over time. Simonian who conveys this story reports also that the date given by the author may be wrong.

Two other Armenian chronicles Ghewond and Stepanos Asoghik of Taron, report in short passages in their histories about a migration from Armenia/Oshakan led by prince Shapuh Amatuni and his son Hamam. Ghewond conveys this immigration to be to avoid heavy taxes imposed on Armenians by the Arab rulers. The Amatuni lords are offered fertile land to settle down by the Byzantine Emperor, after they crossed the Çoruh. This migration is dated to be after 789 by Ghewond and as 750 by Stephen Asoghik of Taron.

Benninghaus specifies &quot;Tambur&quot; as the destination of the migration led by Hamam and his father Shapuh Amaduni and says that they have seemingly met people there who were already Christians, possibly Greeks. Redgate informs about possible symbolism used in the Ghewond&#x27;s history and possible garbling in Mamikonian&#x27;s history, and cautions not to take everything at face value. Hachikian states &quot;There is no clue as to where Tambur, the legendary capital of Hamshen, was located. The only certain thing about it is that it clearly belonged to a much earlier time - if it existed at all&quot;. He also mentions in the footnote the name similarity between Tambur and a yayla known as Tahpur or Tagpur, in the heights of Kaptanpasa. Simonian states that Tambur is probably in the vicinity of Varoşkale (altitude 1800 m).
A description of &quot;Haynsen&quot; in the Kingdom of Georgia, its inhabitants and history is contained in &quot;La Fleur des histoires de la terre d&#x27;Orient&quot; by Hayton of Corycus, written around 1307, translated into English in 1520, and later reproduced in the travellers&#x27; tales of Samuel Purchas published in 1614. Purchas uses the term &quot;Hamsem&quot; to designate the region and concludes that this is the place of the original Cimmerian gloom of Homer&#x27;s Odyssey. The translation of He&#x27;tum&#x27;s related passage to modern English uses the term Hamshen. Hayton describes the region to be &quot;miraculous and strange place&quot; unbelievable unless seen by one&#x27;s own eyes, dark and without roads. Signs of human settlement are that &quot;People in those parts say that one frequently hears the sounds of men bellowing, of cocks crowing, of horses neighing in the forest,&quot; Those people are described by Hayton, leaning upon Georgian and Armenian Histories, to be the descendants of the men of the &quot;wicked&quot; Iranian Emperor Shaworeos who had chased and harassed Christian people. The referenced translation suggests this Emperor could be Shapur II (309–379 AD).

Simonian considers the so described difficulty in access not to imply total isolation. On the contrary, he reports, Hamshen served sometimes as a transit route between the coastal regions and the Armenian Highlands. 

In his analysis of the literary and non-literary sources from the 8th through the 19th centuries, combined with excursions into Hamšēn during the 1980s to identify the surviving Armenian architecture, Dr. Robert W. Edwards has defined the geographical perimeters of that region and assessed the historical impact of its extreme isolation.

Sources of the ruling powers in the region, (Byzantine, Trapezuntine, Georgian, Armenian and Turkish) are silent about Hemshin; until the conquest by the Ottomans. It is deduced that Hemşin has been governed by local lords under the umbrella of the greater regional powers changing by the time namely the Bagratid Armenian kingdom, the Byzantine Empire, its successor the Empire of Trebizond, the Kingdom of Georgia, the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkmen Confederations until it was annexed by the Ottoman Empire which collapsed as a result of the World War I and gave birth to the Republic of Turkey.

The Ottoman conquest of Hemshin occurred sometime in the 1480s: an Ottoman register dated around 1486 calls it &quot;Hemshin&quot; and mentions it as being an Ottoman possession.

===Turkish dominance and division===
Turkish influence was firmly established in the region after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, after which the Seljuk Turks and other Turkish tribes gained a strong foothold in Central Anatolia and Western Armenian Highlands, often referred to as Eastern Anatolia, bringing the local population in contact with the religion of Islam. In the 15th century, the region of Hamshen was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the Turkish rule, two most important developments are human migrations and conversions. Most sources agree that prior to Ottoman era majority of the residents of Hemshin were Christian and members of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The details and the accompanying circumstances for the migrations and the conversions during the Ottoman era are not clearly known or documented.

As a result of those developments, distinctive communities with the same generic name have also appeared in the vicinity of Hopa, Turkey as well as in the Caucasus. Those three communities are almost oblivious to one another&#x27;s existence.
*The Hemshinli of Hemshin proper (also designated occasionally as western Hemshinli in publications) are Turkish-speaking Sunni Muslims who mostly live in the counties (ilçe) of Çamlıhemşin, Çayeli, İkizdere, Pazar and Hemşin in Turkey&#x27;s Rize Province.
*The Hopa Hemshinli (also designated occasionally as eastern Hemshinli in publications) are Sunni Muslims and mostly live in the Hopa and Borçka counties of Turkey&#x27;s Artvin Province. In addition to Turkish, they also speak a dialect of western Armenian they call &quot;Homshetsma&quot; or &quot;Hemşince&quot; in Turkish.
*Homshentsik (also designated occasionally as Northern Homshentsik in publications) are Christians who live in Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia and in Russia&#x27;s Krasnodar Krai. They speak Homshetsma as well. There are also some Muslim Hamshentsi living in Georgia and Krasnodar and some Hamshentsi elements amongst the Meskhetian Turks.

==Demographics==
Two major developments in the Hemshin region during the Ottoman era: Islamization and population movements. Islam may have begun to spread prior to the Ottoman rule, but it did not become the general religion before the end of the 16th century. A number of population movements (both into and out of the region) also happened during the Ottoman era. Even though detailed information regarding the nature of these movements is missing, in summary:
* Some Hemshinli who were members of the Armenian Orthodox Church emigrated to other countries on the eastern Black Sea during the early centuries of Ottoman rule;
* Some Muslim Hemshinli migrated to western Anatolia and the Caucasus as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars and related hardships during the 19th century;
* Some immigration into the area occurred during Ottoman rule.

The present community of Hemshinli is exclusively Muslim and Turkish speaking. This goes for the people living in Hemshin or people maintaining links to the area and living elsewhere in Turkey.

A distinct community settled about 50 km east of Hemşin in villages around Hopa and Borçka also call themselves &quot;Hemşinli&quot;. They are often referred to as the &quot;Hopa Hemşinli&quot;. Professor of Linguistics Bert Vaux at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee refers to this group as the &quot;Eastern Hamshenis&quot;. Hemşinli and Hopa Hemşinli are separated not only by geography but also by language and some features of culture. The two groups are almost oblivious to one another&#x27;s existence. Simonian reports various theories regarding the appearance of the Hopa Hemshinli group. Those theories relate to whether the groups migrated from Hemshin or they were settled by the Ottoman authorities, whether the migration/settlement was in the early 16th or late 17th centuries, and whether the migration took place in one step or two waves. The Hopa Hemşinli are exclusively Muslim as well.
Simonian reports that there is a controversy regarding whether they arrived in the Hopa region as Muslims or converted to Islam after arrival.

The Hopa Hemşinli speak a language called &quot;Hemşince&quot; or (&quot;Homşetsi&quot; and/or Homshetsma in some sources) as well as Turkish. Recent studies by Hovann Simonian (Author: The Hemshin: A Handbook (Caucasus World)) suggest that this language is an archaic dialect of Armenian subject to influence from Turkish and Laz. Vaux also reports that &quot;Hemşince&quot; has been subject to influence from Turkish to a much greater extent than other Armenian dialects. Hemşince and Armenian are largely mutually unintelligible.

In addition to these two groups there are people speaking Hemşince / Homshetsma in the countries of the former USSR whose ancestors probably originated from Hemşin and/or Hopa Hemşin in course of the various population movements to the Caucasus. Many of the Muslim Hemşince speakers in the former USSR were deported from the Adjara area of Georgia during the Stalin era to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Since 1989, a considerable number of these deportees have moved to Krasnodar Krai since 1989, along with the Meskhetian Turks.

==Culture==

Hemshin peoples are well known for their baking, tea growing, and the clever jokes, riddles, and stories that they tell. Some of the anecdotes that the Muslim Hemshinli tell are actually based on older Armenian ones. They accompany dances with their own brand of music using the &quot;tulum&quot; (the Pontic bagpipe) (for the Western group), the &quot;şimşir kaval&quot; (flute made of buxus) (for the Eastern group) or the &quot;Hamshna-Zurna&quot; (Hamsheni zurna) (for the Northern group). The traditional occupations of the Turkish Hemshinli are cultivating tea and maize, breeding livestock, and beekeeping. The Northern Hamshenis of Russia and Georgia, meanwhile, are primarily known as citrus, corn, tobacco and tea growers as well as fishermen.

The people of Hemshin are known for their traditional dress. Women often choose to wrap their head with a &quot;pushi&quot; or long piece of cloth donned with beads, while men often choose to wear hats and vests made of wool or cotton.

The Hemshin people and their mansions were featured in issue 12 of &quot;Cornucopia&quot; magazine.

==Present situation==

===Hemşinli in Turkey===
The &quot;Turkey for the Turks&quot; ideology, writes Neal Ascherson, &quot;offered no security for minorities&quot; with &quot;the tiny Hemşinli group having especially compelling reasons to keep its head down&quot; because &quot;its members are the descendants of Armenians.&quot; Beginning in the 1930s, a number of Turkish historians attempted to ascribe an entirely Turkish origin to the Hemshinli, the most prominent of them being M. Fahrettin Kırzıoğlu, whose theories have since gained wide currency among the community. His theories on the Hemshinli, however, have come under close scrutiny and have been roundly criticized. The German scholars Wolfgang Feurstein and Tucha Berdsena describe Kırzıoğlu&#x27;s methodology as so:

At first Kırzıoğlu assaults the reader with a flow of historical peoples; he then searches for some kind of phonetic correspondence or similarity with an old Turkish tribe, flavors this alleged historical outpouring with a pinch of &quot;Islam,&quot; and presents himself as a competent researcher of Turkishness. Probably never before has a single person in Turkey falsified history so massively!

The filmmaker Özcan Alper, an eastern Hemshinli, made the first motion picture in Homshetsi, &quot;Momi&quot; (&quot;Grandma&quot;), released in 2000. As a result, Alper was accused in the Court for State Security of producing material intended to destroy the unity of the state, under article 8 of Turkey&#x27;s anti-terror law. This law was repealed in 2003 after EU pressure, and Alper&#x27;s trial did not go ahead. Hamsheni singer Gökhan Birben (from the Western group) and Laz singer Kâzım Koyuncu had also sung in Homshetsi. In 2005, the first music album exclusively of anonymous Hamshen folk songs and sung mostly in Homshetsi, &quot;Vova - Hamşetsu Ğhağ&quot; was released.

Older generations of Turkish Hemshinli see the reference &quot;Ermeni&quot; (often used by their Laz neighbours) as an insult.

Mesut Yılmaz, a former Prime Minister of Turkey, was born in Istanbul to a family with partial Hamsheni (Western group) origins. Ahmet Tevfik İleri (who was born in Yaltkaya (Gomno) village of Hemşin), a Deputy Prime Minister and before that, a Minister of Education in Turkey within successive Adnan Menderes governments between 1950 and 1960, as well as Damat Mehmet Ali Pasha, the Ottoman Grand Vizier on the eve of the Crimean War in 1853 were also of Hamsheni descent. The community issued other important names in Turkish history and society such as Murat Karayalçın, a former Deputy Prime Minister and mayor of Ankara who is from Şenyuva (Çinçiva) village of Çamlıhemşin.

There are two ongoing projects involving Turkish NGOs and EuropeAid, European Commission&#x27;s external aid instrument, that touch their issues. The more recently (2007) launched &quot;Ecodialogue Project&quot; has set itself as goal raising environment consciousness of the region&#x27;s enterprises and improving the poor levels and quality of the information relayed by local guides, many of whom are self-styled and unlicensed. The other project, started 2004 and involving also the World Conservation Union, aims to raise the profile and awareness of the grouse, particularly black grouse, who visit the region, also with focus on enterprises and guides.

===Hamshenis in Russia and the former Soviet Union===
Interest in Hamshen heritage is rising among Christian Hamshenis in the former Soviet Union. In 2006, the first music album in Homshetsma by the Ensemble Caravan was released in Krasnodar. Hamshen Scientific, Information and Cultural Centre began to work on exclusive projects in order to recover the cultural heritage of the Hamshenis living in the region. The Armenian newspaper published in Sukhumi carries the name &quot;Hamshen&quot;.

During the Mikhail Gorbachev period of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, the Hamshenis of Kazakhstan began petitioning for the government to move them to the Armenian SSR. However, this move was denied by Moscow because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian brothers.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, most Hamshenis lived relatively undisturbed. However, those in the Abkhazia region of Georgia had trouble coping with day-to-day life during the Georgian Civil War.

Since 2000, several hundred of the Muslim Hamshenis in Russia who have resettled from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to Krasnodar Krai (about 1000 total) have repeatedly attempted to formally receive registration from the local authorities. This is similar and related to the problem of the Meskhetians. These actions have been made difficult by the attitude of the Krasnodar officials. In defiance of the authorities an organisation of their co-ethnics in Armenia have appealed to the Russian ambassador in Yerevan to get Moscow to intervene in this case and overrule the regional officials who seem intent on preventing Hamshenis from gaining a status of permanent residency.

In the 2002 Russian Federation census, 1,542 people identified themselves as Hamshenis, two-thirds of whom were living in Krasnodar Krai.

Sochi has an ethnic Russian majority (~70%) but is home to a sizable Armenian minority (~20%), which is especially notable in the Adlersky City District where they compose more than half of the total population. Most of Sochi&#x27;s Armenian community are descendants of Hamshen Armenians from Turkey&#x27;s northeastern Black Sea coast, who began arriving in the late 19th century.

===Recognition by the Armenian mainstream===
From October 13 to 15, 2005, a Hamsheni international scientific convention was held in Sochi. The conference was organized under the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of Armenia, Russian-Armenian Commonwealth Organization of Moscow (commissioned by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation) with help from the Armenian Scientific Informational and Cultural Center, &quot;Hamshen&quot; (Krasnodar, Russia) and Russian Armenian newspaper &quot;Yerkramas&quot;. It involved scholars from Armenia, Russia, the United States, Germany, and Iran to discuss the past of the Hamshenis.

<text>Robert Melvin Fleming (17 March 1845 – 31 July 1933) was a Scottish financier and philanthropist. He was the founder of merchant bank Robert Fleming &amp; Co.

==Early life==
Robert Fleming was born in 1845 in Dundee. His father was an overseer in a jute mill.

==Career==
Fleming got his start at the age of 13 working for local textile firm, Messrs Edward Baxter and Son. By 21, he was Edward Baxter&#x27;s private clerk. In time, Fleming had learned enough about investment procedures from Baxter to oversee the firm&#x27;s American holdings.

Fleming launched the Scottish American Investment Company in 1873, the first of the Scottish investment trusts. He went on to become an international financier in London, establishing the investment bank that bore his name for more than a century and out of which the Fleming Collection of Scottish art and the Fleming Collection Gallery was born.

A contemporary of J. P. Morgan and a close business associate and friend of Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., Fleming was widely known and respected in financial circles on both sides of the Atlantic. He was one of the shrewdest investors of his generation and an acknowledged expert in the financing of American railroads. One of his less successful ventures was the 1908 takeover of the bankrupt works of Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, but he had the foresight to associate with the project James Hamet Dunn, who would come to control the works from 1935.

Fleming bought Joyce Grove in Nettlebed, Oxfordshire in 1903, along with its 2000 acre estate. He commissioned a new house from the architect C.E. Mallows in 1908.

Fleming became one of the wealthiest men in Europe, with Robert Fleming &amp; Co. remaining one of the few independent British investment houses in London by the turn of the century.

==Philanthropy==
Fleming made many generous bequests to the city and the new University College. The Fleming Gymnasium (opened in 1905 and now housing Forensic Medicine) still bears his name.

The Fleming Gardens Estate in Dundee was erected as a result of a gift of £155,000 that Fleming made to improve worker&#x27;s housing. His gift is commemorated in a plaque and balustraded viewpoint at the junction of Clepington Road and Hindmarsh Avenue.

==Personal life==
Fleming was the father of Valentine Fleming and Philip Fleming. He was the grandfather of novelist Ian Fleming, who wrote the James Bond novels, and writer Peter Fleming. Sir John Fleming, onetime Lord Provost of Aberdeen and later a local MP, was a younger brother.

==Death==
Fleming died in 1933 and is buried in St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in Nettlebed. His will was proven on 8 September, with his estate amounting to about £2,174,803 (calculated to be equivalent to £ in ).

<text>Fitna (or , pl. &quot;&quot;; : &quot;temptation, trial; sedition, civil strife, conflict&quot;) is an Arabic term that denotes concepts such as temptation, trial, sedition, civil strife, and conflict. The term encompasses a broad range of connotations, including trial, affliction, and distress. While it holds significant historical importance, the word is also widely used in modern Arabic, often without reference to its historical connotations.

A distinction can be observed between the meanings of &quot;&quot; as used in Classical Arabic and its meanings as used in Modern Standard Arabic and various colloquial dialects. Given the conceptual significance of &quot;fitna&quot; in the Qur’an, its Qur’anic usage warrants separate consideration from, though in addition to, its broader lexical meaning in Classical Arabic.

In Islamic historiography, &quot;fitna&quot; specifically refers to civil wars within a Muslim polity, notably the five civil wars of the Islamic Caliphate between the 7th and 9th centuries CE starting with the First Fitna.

==Root and forms==
Arabic, in common with other Semitic languages like Hebrew, employs a system of root letters combined with vowel patterns to constitute its whole range of vocabulary. As such, identification of the root letters of any word might bring a better understanding the word&#x27;s full semantic range.

&quot;Fitna&quot; has the triliteral root &quot;fā&#x27;-tā&#x27;-nūn&quot; (). In addition to the feminine noun &quot;fitna&quot;, &quot;fitan&quot;, this root forms, in particular, a Form I active verb &quot;fatana&quot;, &quot;yaftinu&quot; (), a Form I passive verb &quot;futina&quot;, &quot;yuftanu&quot; (), a Form I maṣdar &quot;futūn&quot; (), a Form I active participle &quot;fātin&quot; (), a Form I passive participle &quot;maftūn&quot; (), and so on.

==Lexical meanings==

===Classical Arabic===
Edward William Lane, in his &quot;Arabic-English Lexicon&quot; compiled from various traditional Arabic lexicographical sources available in Cairo in the mid-19th-century, reported that &quot;to burn&quot; is the &quot;primary signification&quot; of the verb. The verb then came to be applied to the smelting of gold and silver. It was extended to mean causing one to enter into fire and into a state of punishment or affliction. Thus, one says that something caused one to enter &quot;al-fitna&quot;, i.e. trial, affliction, etc., or more generally, an affliction whereby some good or evil quality is put to the test. Lane glosses the noun &quot;fitna&quot; as meaning a trial, a probation, affliction, distress or hardship, and says that &quot;the sum total of its meaning in the language of the Arabs&quot; is an affliction whereby one is tried, proved or tested.

The definitions offered by Lane match those suggested by Badawi and Haleem in their dictionary of Qur&#x27;anic usage. They gloss the triliteral root as having the following meanings: &quot;to purify gold and silver by smelting them; to burn; to put to the test, to afflict (in particular as a means of testing someone&#x27;s endurance); to disrupt the peace of a community; to tempt, to seduce, to allure, to infatuate.&quot;

===Modern Standard Arabic===
The meanings of &quot;fitna&quot; as found in Classical Arabic largely carry over into Modern Standard Arabic, as evidenced by the recitation of the same set of meanings in Hans Wehr&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic&quot;. In addition, Wehr glosses the noun &quot;fitna&quot; as also meaning &quot;charm, charmingness, attractiveness; enchantment, captivation, fascination, enticement, temptation; infatuation, intrigue; sedition, riot, discord, dissension, civil strife.&quot;

Buckwalter &amp; Parkinson, in their frequency dictionary of Arabic, list the noun &quot;fitna&quot; as the 1,560th most frequent word in their corpus of over 30 million words from Modern Standard Arabic and colloquial Arabic dialects. They gloss &quot;fitna&quot; as meaning &quot;charm, allure, enchantment; unrest; riot, rebellion.&quot;

==Nakhla Raid (first mention of &quot;fitna&quot; in Quran)==
The first Quran verse about &quot;fitna&quot; was supposedly revealed during the Nakhla Raid. After his return from the first Badr encounter (Battle of Safwan), Muhammad sent Abdullah ibn Jahsh in Rajab with 12 men on a fact-finding operation. Abdullah ibn Jahsh was a maternal cousin of Muhammad. He took along with him Abu Haudhayfa, Abdullah ibn Jahsh, Ukkash ibn Mihsan, Utba b. Ghazwan, Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, Amir ibn Rabia, Waqid ibn Abdullah and Khalid ibn al-Bukayr. Muhammad gave Abdullah ibn Jahsh a letter, but not to be read until he had traveled for two days and then to do what he was instructed to do in the letter without putting pressure on his companions. Abdullah proceeded for two days, then he opened the letter; it told him to proceed until he reached Nakhla, between Mecca and Taif, to lie in wait for the Quraysh, and to observe what they were doing.

While the Quraysh were busy preparing food, the Muslims attacked. In the short battle that took place, Waqid ibn Abdullah killed Amr ibn Hadrami, the leader of the Quraysh caravan, with an arrow. The Muslims captured two Quraysh tribe members. Nawfal ibn Abdullah managed to escape. The Muslims took Uthman ibn Abdullah and al-Hakam ibn Kaysan as captives. Abdullah ibn Jahsh returned to Medina with the booty and with the two captured Quraysh tribe members. The followers planned to give one-fifth of the booty to Muhammad.

===Mention in the Quran===
Muhammad initially disapproved of that act and suspended any action as regards the camels and the two captives on account of the prohibited months. The Arab pagans exploited this opportunity to accuse the Muslims of violating what is divinely inviolable (fighting in the months considered sacred to the Arab pagans). This idle talk brought about a painful headache for Muhammad&#x27;s companions, until at last they were relieved when Muhammad revealed a verse regarding fighting in the sacred months
According to Ibn Qayyim, &quot;most of the scholars have explained the word Fitnah here as meaning Shirk&quot;

The Muslim Mufassir Ibn Kathir&#x27;s commentary on this verse in his book Tafsir ibn Kathir is as follows:
means, trying to force the Muslims to revert from their religion and re-embrace Kufr after they had believed, is worse with Allah than killing.&#x27; Allah said:

==In the Qur&#x27;an==

===Statistics===
Badawi &amp; Haleem note that the triliteral root &quot;fā&#x27;-tā&#x27;-nūn&quot; () occurs in 6 different forms a total of 60 times in the Qur&#x27;an. In particular, it appears 34 times as a noun and 26 times in various verbal forms. Bakhtiar&#x27;s concordance of the Qur&#x27;an confirms Badawi &amp; Haleem&#x27;s numbers, although Bakhtiar further breaks down the appearance of each verbal form by distinguishing active and passive verbs by tense as well. The following table sets out the details; note that since the root only appears as a verb in Form I forms, that is assumed.

===Semantics===
The triliteral root &quot;fā&#x27;-tā&#x27;-nūn&quot; (), as noted above, bears a range of significations, even in the Qur&#x27;an itself. The Qur&#x27;anic appearances of the root are explored below (in no particular order).

====Persecution====
&quot;Fitna&quot; as persecution appears in several of the verses commanding Muslims to fight the unbelievers (specifically referring to the Meccan polytheists who had persecuted Muhammad and his early followers, thus leading to the &quot;hijra&quot;). For example, in Qur&#x27;an , the command to fight is justified on the grounds that &quot;persecution (&quot;al-fitnatu&quot;) is worse than slaying.&quot; Similarly, in Qur&#x27;an , Muslims are forbidden from fighting unbelievers around the Holy Mosque in Mecca unless the unbelievers attack first, in which case Muslims are to fight &quot;until there is no persecution (&quot;fitnatun&quot;) and the religion is God&#x27;s.&quot; The &quot;hijra&quot; is mentioned in Qur&#x27;an as having occurred because of the persecution believers had suffered in Mecca. Other examples are Qur&#x27;an , which promises the chastisement of Hell for those who have persecuted Muslims, and Qur&#x27;an , which provides that one&#x27;s daily required prayer may be shortened if, when on a journey, one fears that the unbelievers may attack if one remains in a place long enough to complete the full prayer.

====Dissension/sedition====
In Qur&#x27;an , the Qur&#x27;an itself is described as having &quot;clear revelations – they are the substance of the Book – and others (which are) allegorical,&quot; and then the Qur&#x27;an characterizes those who are unsteady and who do not have firm faith as desiring dissension in the community through their pursuit of interpretations of the &quot;allegorical&quot; verses of the Qur&#x27;an. A set of occurrences of the root related to dissension or sedition occurs in Quran , where those who say they are believers, but show themselves reluctant to follow certain of God&#x27;s commands, are described as seeking &quot;sedition&quot; among the community.

====Trial====
Many instances of the root as &quot;trial&quot; appear throughout the Qur&#x27;an. This sense of the root bears the further sense of a &quot;tribulation&quot; or &quot;difficulty&quot; in such verses as, for example: Qur&#x27;an , where Moses, after killing a man in Egypt, was &quot;tried with a heavy trial&quot; by being forced to flee and to live among the Midians for many years; and Qur&#x27;an , where some believers are characterized as worshipping God &quot;upon a narrow marge,&quot; since they are happy so long as their life is relatively secure and easy, but as soon as they experience a trial, they turn away from God.

However, the root in other verses carries a sense of &quot;trial&quot; as simply a kind of test of a person&#x27;s commitment to their faith (without necessarily implying that the testing results from something bad happening, as the sense of trial as &quot;tribulation&quot; might bear). For example, Qur&#x27;an says, in part, &quot;And even so do We try some of them by others.&quot; Things widely recognized as good things in life may serve as trials, as Qur&#x27;an and make clear by describing one&#x27;s own wealth and children as trials. Qur&#x27;an also carries this sense of trial by something good; there, God&#x27;s own &quot;boon&quot; (or &quot;blessing&quot;) is described as a trial for certain people. Again, in Qur&#x27;an , God will give those idolaters who decide to &quot;tread the right path&quot; an abundance of good &quot;that We may test them thereby,&quot; to see whether they will turn away from God once they have obtained his favor or whether they will be steadfast in faith.

Trials may also result from things revealed by God that some may find difficult to accept. For example, Qur&#x27;an describes the revelation of the &quot;Cursed Tree&quot; as &quot;an ordeal for mankind.&quot; Another example of this sense is Qur&#x27;an , where the number of the angels who guard the Fire has been &quot;made a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve ... and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say: What meaneth Allah by this similitude?&quot;

====Temptation====
The root also bears the sense of &quot;temptation,&quot; as in Qur&#x27;an , where those who were hypocritical in their faith will be turned away and told by the steadfast believers, from whom they are separated, &quot;ye tempted one another, and hesitated, and doubted, and vain desires beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass; and the deceiver deceived you concerning Allah.&quot; In Qur&#x27;an , Aaron is said to have warned the Israelites, when Moses had left them to meet with God for forty days, that the Golden Calf was only something they were being tempted by (or, in Pickthall&#x27;s translation, &quot;seduced with&quot;). Harut and Marut warn the people of Babylon, in Qur&#x27;an , &quot;We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not,&quot; although the warning proved to be ineffective for some.

==Historical usage==

Aside from its use in the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;fitna&quot; came to have a primary sense of &quot;&#x27;revolt&#x27;, &#x27;disturbances&#x27;, &#x27;civil war&#x27;, but a civil war that breeds schism and in which the believers&#x27; purity of faith is in grave danger.&quot; This was especially so as it came, in the term First Fitna, to refer to the first major civil war of the Islamic Caliphate, which lasted from 656 to 661. &quot;On account of the struggles that marked Mu&#x27;āwiya&#x27;s advent, the term &quot;fitna&quot; was later applied to any period of disturbances inspired by schools or sects that broke away from the majority of believers.&quot; The term thus appears the descriptions of other major conflicts such as the Second Fitna (680–92), the Third Fitna (744–47), the Fourth Fitna (809–27), and the Fitna of al-Andalus (1009–1031).

<doc id="1070309" wikidata="Q5156345" url="?curid=1070309" title="Competitive Enterprise Institute">
<text>The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a non-profit libertarian think tank founded by the political writer Fred L. Smith Jr. on March 9, 1984, in Washington, D.C., to advance principles of limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty. CEI focuses on a number of regulatory policy issues, including business and finance, labor, technology and telecommunications, transportation, food and drug regulation, and energy and environment in which they have promoted climate change denial. Kent Lassman is the current President and CEO.

According to the &quot;2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot; (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), CEI was number 59 (of 90) in the &quot;Top Think Tanks in the United States&quot;.

==Policy areas==

=== Energy and environment ===

Academic research has identified CEI as one of the think tanks funded to overturn the environmentalism of the 1960s, central to promoting climate change denial. It was involved in assisting the anti-environmental climate change policy of the George W. Bush administration. CEI promotes environmental policies based on limited government regulation and property rights, rejects what it calls &quot;global warming alarmism&quot;, and denies the science of climate change.

CEI is an opponent of government action by the Environmental Protection Agency that would require limits on greenhouse gas emissions. It favors free-market environmentalism and supports the idea that market institutions are more effective in protecting the environment than is government. In 2016, CEI President Kent Lassman wrote on the organization&#x27;s blog that, &quot;there is no debate about whether the Earth&#x27;s climate is warming&quot;, that &quot;human activities very likely contribute to that warming&quot;, and that &quot;this has long been the CEI&#x27;s position&quot;. In March 1992, CEI&#x27;s founder Fred Smith said of global warming: &quot;Most of the indications right now are it looks pretty good. Warmer winters, warmer nights, no effects during the day because of clouding, sounds to me like we&#x27;re moving to a more benign planet, more rain, richer, easier productivity to agriculture.&quot;

In May 2006, CEI&#x27;s global warming policy activities attracted attention as it embarked upon an ad campaign with two television commercials. These ads promote carbon dioxide as a positive factor in the environment and argue that global warming is not a concern. One ad focuses on the message that CO2 is misrepresented as a pollutant, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s essential to life. We breathe it out. Plants breathe it in... They call it pollution. We call it life.&quot; The other states that the world&#x27;s glaciers are &quot;growing, not melting... getting thicker, not thinner.&quot; It cites &quot;Science&quot; articles to support its claims. However, the editor of &quot;Science&quot; stated that the ad &quot;misrepresents the conclusions of the two cited &quot;Science&quot; papers... by selective referencing&quot;. The author of the articles, Curt Davis, director of the Center for Geospatial Intelligence at the University of Missouri, said CEI was misrepresenting his previous research to inflate their claims. &quot;These television ads are a deliberate effort to confuse and mislead the public about the global warming debate,&quot; Davis said.

In 2009, CEI&#x27;s director of energy and global warming policy told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The only thing that&#x27;s been demonstrated to reduce emissions is economic collapse&quot;. In 2014, CEI sued the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy over a video that linked the polar vortex to climate change.

===Regulatory reform===

CEI advocates for regulatory reform on a range of policy issues, including energy, environment, business and finance, labor, technology and telecommunications, transportation, and food and drug regulation.

Its annual survey of the federal regulatory state &quot;Ten Thousand Commandments: An Annual Snapshot of the Federal Regulatory State,&quot; documents the size, scope, and cost of federal regulations, and how the U.S. regulatory burden affects American consumers, businesses, and the economy. CEI&#x27;s Clyde Wayne Crews Jr. coined the phrase &quot;regulatory dark matter,&quot; referencing astrophysics to distinguish between ordinary government regulations or &quot;visible matter,&quot; and &quot;regulatory dark matter,&quot; which consists of &quot;thousands of executive branch and federal agency proclamations and issuances, including memos, guidance documents, bulletins, circulars and announcements with practical regulatory effect.&quot;

===Technology and telecommunications===
In 2015, CEI filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioners in U.S. Telecom v. FCC. The brief argued that &quot;Congress did not authorize the FCC to regulate the Internet when it enacted Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act [of 1996] and, in fact, placed it outside the scope of the FCC&#x27;s rulemaking authority.&quot;

CEI has argued against using antitrust regulation to break up big technology companies such as Facebook and Google.

===Capitalism===
CEI has a longstanding project to recapture what they term &quot;the moral legitimacy of capitalism&quot; through research, writing, events, and other outreach activities. In 2019, CEI&#x27;s vice president for Strategy Iain Murray argued, in an op-ed for The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, that advocates of capitalism and free markets had taken the support of social conservatives for granted.

===Project 2025===
CEI was a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election, from June 2022 through March 2024.

==Legal advocacy==
The Competitive Enterprise Institute &quot;is one of a small number of think tanks that have a litigation arm to their organization, according to an editorial in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.&quot;

=== Center for Class Action Fairness (former project) ===
From 2015 to 2019, the Center for Class Action Fairness (CCAF) was part of CEI. It has since spun off as part of the new Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, a free-market nonprofit public-interest law founded by former CEI attorneys Ted Frank and Melissa Holyoak. CCAF represents class members against what it calls, &quot;unfair class action procedures and settlements.&quot;

CEI and Frank argued &quot;Frank v. Gaos&quot; before the U.S. Supreme Court on October 31, 2018, opposing a proposed class action settlement involving Google, who paid out an $8.5 million settlement including $6 million in cy-près funds and more than $2 million for class-action lawyers. Class members were not awarded any part of the settlement.

In 2015, CEI and Frank successfully appealed a class action settlement in a case about the length of Subway&#x27;s &quot;footlong&quot; sandwiches. CEI argued that the proposed settlement benefited only nine people in the class but awarded more than half a million dollars to the class attorneys. Judge Diane Sykes&#x27;s ruling rejected the settlement in the Subway case that would have paid plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys $525,000 and left the class with nothing. The court&#x27;s decision included the statement that &quot;[a] class settlement that results in fees for class counsel but yields no meaningful relief for the class is no better than a racket.&quot;

===Challenges to the Affordable Care Act===
CEI funded and coordinated &quot;King v. Burwell&quot; and &quot;Halbig v. Burwell&quot;, two lawsuits that challenged the Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The strategy of bringing such lawsuits was pioneered by Michael S. Greve, former chairman of CEI&#x27;s board of directors, who stated: &quot;This bastard [the act] has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene. I do not care how this is done, whether it&#x27;s dismembered, whether we drive a stake through its heart, whether we tar and feather it, and drive it out of town, whether we strangle it.&quot; The &quot;King v. Burwell&quot; suit alleged that the IRS&#x27;s implementation violated the statute and sought to block &quot;a major portion of Obamacare: the subsidies that more than 6 million middle-income people, across more than 30 states, now receive to buy health insurance.&quot; CEI general counsel Sam Kazman argued in a &quot;USA Today&quot; op-ed that the disputed IRS rule &quot;raises a basic issue that goes far beyond Obamacare: Do agencies have to follow the laws enacted by Congress, or can they rewrite them?&quot; The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which is a 6–3 decision rejected the challenge and upheld the ACA subsidies.

===Challenges to the Dodd-Frank Act and financial regulation===
In 2012, the CEI, along with the conservative activist group 60 Plus Association, filed a lawsuit against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CEI&#x27;s suit alleges that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act&#x27;s creation of the CFPB violates the constitutional separation of powers. The CEI also contends that President Obama&#x27;s recess appointment of Richard Cordray as CFPB director was unconstitutional and that the powers of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, created by Dodd-Frank, are unconstitutional. In 2016, a federal judge rejected the challenge to Cordray&#x27;s appointment. The CEI&#x27;s challenge to the constitutionality of CFPB remains pending in the federal courts.

==CEI events==
Every year CEI hosts an annual dinner gala and presents the Julian L. Simon Memorial Award. The Simon award honors the work of the late economist, winner of the Simon–Ehrlich wager. Award winners have included:

==CEI projects==

===Warren T. Brookes Journalism Fellowship===
In 1991, CEI established the Warren T. Brookes Journalism Fellowship to identify and train journalists who wish to improve their knowledge of environmental issues and free-market economics. In this manner, the program seeks to perpetuate the legacy of Warren Brookes, who was a longtime journalist with the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; and the &quot;Detroit News&quot; and a nationally syndicated columnist. Former and current fellows include:
===Bureaucrash===

Bureaucrash was a special outreach and activist project of CEI described as an international network of pro-freedom activists working to promote a political ideology based on personal and economic freedom. It conducted political activism using new media, creative marketing, and education campaigns. The project maintained a website (bureaucrash.com), which as of November 2023 is now only a web redirect to CEI&#x27;s main website.

==Funding==
CEI is funded by donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. Donors to CEI include a number of companies in the energy, technology, automotive, and alcohol and tobacco industries.

CEI&#x27;s revenues for the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2015, were $7.5 million against expenses of $7.4 million. ExxonMobil Corporation was a donor to CEI, giving the group about $2 million over seven years. In 2006, the company announced that it had ended its funding for the group.

<doc id="1070314" wikidata="Q906537" url="?curid=1070314" title="Diver Down">
<text>Diver Down is the fifth studio album by American rock band Van Halen, released on April 19, 1982 by Warner Bros. Records. It spent 65 weeks on the album chart in the United States and had, by 1998, sold four million copies in the United States. Despite its commercial success, selling faster than its predecessor &quot;Fair Warning&quot; (1981), it was more lukewarmly received by contemporary music critics.

Released per the label&#x27;s request that the group record an album to keep them in the public eye, &quot;Diver Down&quot; was recorded with producer Ted Templeman over the course of twelve days. As a result of its quick production, the album is heavy on cover versions as well as genre experiments and guitar interludes. Alongside full-length original songs, the material includes excursions into jazz, country blues, doo-wop, a cappella and neo-classical music, in addition to covers of mid-1960s songs – the biggest of these, reworkings of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot; and Martha &amp; the Vandellas&#x27; &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, were hit singles.
==Background and recording==
Five of the twelve songs on the album are covers, the most popular being the cover of &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot;, a Roy Orbison song. Eddie Van Halen recalled how the album came about:
Three of the original songs were around long before the album was made. &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; can trace its roots back to 1976 as &quot;Last Night&quot;, which had the same music but different lyrics. &quot;The Full Bug&quot; borrows heavily from a demo track called &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; (not the track of the same name released on Roth&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Skyscraper&quot;) that leaked in 2023 and &quot;Cathedral&quot; was played in its final form throughout 1981 with earlier versions going back to 1980. Additionally, &quot;Happy Trails&quot; had been recorded for their 1977 demos.

&quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&quot; is a cover of a song by The Kinks. During the band&#x27;s bar-playing days, vocalist David Lee Roth bought a budget label Kinks double album, and Van Halen learned all of the songs on one side to use as staples of their set. Eddie Van Halen created the effects in the guitar solo by running the edge of his pick up and down the strings and using an Echoplex.

&quot;Cathedral&quot; was so named because the band members thought it sounded like a Catholic church organ. The track is a well-known example of the &#x27;cascade effect&#x27; on guitar, described by Jon Chappell of &quot;EQ Magazine&quot; as when the guitarist &quot;plays eighth notes and the delay spits back notes of equal-amplitude on the second and fourth sixteenth notes, creating a steady stream of sixteenth notes. This doubles the rate at which notes come from the guitar&quot;. The piece was a stylistic departure for Van Halen, with a quite prowess that has been compared to Focus.

The lyrics to &quot;Secrets&quot; were inspired by greeting cards which Roth bought in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the preceding tour. Eddie Van Halen used a Gibson doubleneck 12-string for the song, played with a flatpick. The solo was done in one take.

The track &quot;Intruder&quot;, which precedes &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot;, was written by Roth specifically to cover the length of the promotional video for the &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot; single. Roth recalled that the video &quot;was about three minutes too long. So, I said, we won&#x27;t cut any of it; we&#x27;ll write soundtrack music for the beginning. So we went into the studio and I played the synthesizer and I wrote it. It took about an hour to put that together.&quot; It is characterized by its shrieking, distorting guitars, displaying heavy dissonance, and is comparable to Neu!&#x27;s &quot;Negativland&quot; (1972). The &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot; music video was one of the first banned by MTV, although VH1 Classic (now MTV Classic) has continuously aired it. Roth explained the ban as the result of complaints that it made fun of &quot;an almost theological figure&quot;, the Samurai warrior (played by bassist Michael Anthony), and also because two little people appeared to molest a woman (actually a Los Angeles area transgender performer). The video, directed by Roth and Pete Angelus, was, he said: &quot;rather like a surrealistic art project ... where they paint the picture and come back three days later and try to figure out what they meant.&quot;

&quot;Little Guitars&quot; was inspired by the flamenco guitar playing of Carlos Montoya. Eddie Van Halen found he was unable to imitate Montoya&#x27;s finger picking, so he used a pick as an assist. Roth, who thought the music Eddie Van Halen came up with sounded Mexican (Montoya was actually Spanish), wrote lyrics intended to evoke that nation. The guitar used on the recording (and subsequent tour) was a miniature Les Paul, built by Nashville luthier David Petschulat and sold to Eddie on the earlier Fair Warning Tour.

Covering &quot;Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)&quot; was Roth&#x27;s idea, as was having Eddie and Alex Van Halen&#x27;s father Jan play clarinet on the track. Deemed a &quot;campy period piece,&quot; it has been compared to the Temperance Seven, and Freddie Mercury.

Of &quot;The Full Bug&quot;, Roth said &#x27;PRFCs&#x27; were &quot;great shoes for when the cockroach moves into the corner and you can&#x27;t get at it with your foot or the broom anymore. You just jam your toe into the corner and hit as hard as you can. And if you did it right you got the full bug. So this slang means — bammm! — you have to give it everything you&#x27;ve got. Make the maximum effort, do everything possible, get the full bug.&quot;

&quot;Happy Trails&quot; is a playful a cappella version of the Dale Evans song. Reviewers have compared it to Cream&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Lament&quot; at the end of &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

==Cover art==
The album cover artwork displays the &quot;diver down&quot; flag used in many US (and Canadian) jurisdictions to indicate a Scuba diver is currently submerged in the area. David Lee Roth said it was meant to imply that &quot;there was something going on that&#x27;s not apparent to your eyes. You put up the red flag with the white slash. Well, a lot of people approach Van Halen as sort of the abyss. It means, it&#x27;s not immediately apparent to your eyes what is going on underneath the surface.&quot; While impressed by Roth&#x27;s creative marketing spin, manager Noel Monk also explained the sexual double-entendre &quot;dive her down&quot; in his 2017 band memoir &quot;Running with the Devil&quot;. The back cover of the album features a photo by Richard Aaron of Van Halen on stage at the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida, that was taken on October 24, 1981, as they concluded a set opening for The Rolling Stones. The sleeve has been noted for its &#x27;modern&#x27;, minimalist aesthetic, reminiscent of the sleeves of &quot;Joy Division impersonators&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In a review for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Don Waller considered &quot;Diver Down&quot; to be &quot;the best heavy-metal record to come along in several years.&quot; He enjoyed how several &quot;mid-60s classics&quot; were customized into vehicles for the band&#x27;s &quot;high-octane assault&quot;, further highlighting the three instrumentals for adding &quot;spice&quot;, and how the original songs &quot;rework unorthodox metal dictums with a twist&quot;. &quot;Best of all&quot;, he added, is the band&#x27;s &quot;loony sense of humour&quot;, as shown by covering the vintage jazz-blues song &quot;Big Bad Bill&quot;. &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot; critic Bart Becker named Van Halen the best heavy metal band partly for their tongue-in-cheek style, adding that besides some original songs, the group &quot;forges heavy-metal&quot; out of &quot;unexpected elements&quot; such as country blues, doo-wop, a cappella, clarinets, and the Roy Orbison and Marvin Gaye covers. Cynthia Rose of &quot;New Musical Express&quot; praised Templeman&#x27;s production for holding the experiments – namely the acoustic intros, &quot;planes&quot; of synthesiser, clarinet parts, a cappella singing and &quot;some throwaway humour&quot; – in &quot;expert balance&quot;, and wrote that while a quarter of the album is filler, Roth&#x27;s voice suits the crass lyrics.

Steve Smith of &quot;The Times&quot; stated that &quot;Diver Down&quot; continues the band&#x27;s &quot;four-year tradition of recycling old songs ... without adding anything new, save some heavy-metal chording and David Roth&#x27;s snarling vocals.&quot; However, he noted several pleasant surprises that, along with the &quot;odd little instrumentals&quot;, evidence the band&#x27;s imagination, further lauding Templeman&#x27;s production and &quot;brief moments of instrumental lucidity&quot; from the Van Halen brothers. Parke Puterbaugh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes that if listeners disregard the five cover versions and three instrumentals, &quot;Diver Down&quot; &quot;suddenly seems like a cogent case for consumer fraud. Van Halen, it appears, is running out of ideas: there&#x27;s more excelsior here than in a shipment of glassware.&quot; He adds that aside from Eddie&#x27;s &quot;three guitar nocturnes&quot;, there are only four original compositions, only two of which are exciting.

Reviewing the album for &quot;The Rocket&quot;, John Keister believed the album &quot;sounds like it was a lot of fun to make&quot;, but commented that it contains filler songs which grow off listeners after several listens, noting: &quot;Many of the cuts on this album are intros that seem to serve little function except taking up space on the vinyl.&quot; He believed it should have been cut to a four-song EP. Robin Smith of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; wrote in his review: &quot;Reworking three old standards and messing around on the flip side doesn&#x27;t make a great album – and Van Halen should have produced an earthquake.&quot; Bill Carlton of &quot;Daily News&quot; commented that while the album is naturally heavy on energetic rock songs, Van Halen also proved capable of the &quot;lovely neo-classical&quot; piece &quot;Cathedral&quot;. However, he panned the 1960s covers and considered the barbershop quartet rendition of &quot;Happy Trails&quot; to be undercut by its apparent insincerity. In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Sandy Robertson criticised the new material, calling the songs &quot;a curious lucky bag&quot;, and felt that side two was &quot;so mixed up&quot;, overall believing the album should have been a more coherent statement.

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called &quot;Diver Down&quot; &quot;one of Van Halen&#x27;s best records, one that&#x27;s just pure joy to hear&quot;, saying it hearkens back to the exuberance and lightheartedness of their early albums while retaining the tightly knit and practiced playing honed over the length of their career. He also found it effectively showcased all four individual members, and said the cover songs were thoroughly revamped to make them distinctly Van Halen works. Dave Queen of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; noted that with its &quot;additional fragments, sketches, and impenetrable arcana,&quot; &quot;Diver Down&quot; is &quot;like an &#x27;unofficial&#x27; Fall release or &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;.&quot; Colin Larkin, writing in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (1997), names &quot;Diver Down&quot; the weakest Van Halen album, praising only the covers of 1960s standards as the standout tracks. The editors of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) describe the album as a return to form for Van Halen, &quot;entertaining with a smile and lots of squeals&quot;, adding that it contains &quot;a ridiculous five covers, but they&#x27;re some of the band&#x27;s best&quot;. In his reference book &quot;Copendium&quot; (2012), Julian Cope dismissed &quot;Diver Down&quot; as &quot;bar band filler of the most abject variety (how can I live without more covers of &#x27;Pretty Woman&#x27;, &#x27;Dancing in the Street&#x27; and &#x27;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&#x27;?)&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2022, &quot;Diver Down&quot; was ranked at number three in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s list of &quot;The 25 greatest rock guitar albums of 1982&quot;. Country musician Kenny Chesney, who later socialised with Eddie van Halen and Sammy Hagar, has commented that it was &quot;the first album he ever bought&quot;. In rankings of the band&#x27;s albums, &quot;Diver Down&quot; has been ranked seventh best by Matthew Wilkening of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; and the staff of &quot;Consequence&quot;, and ninth best by Eduardo RivadavIa of &quot;Loudwire&quot;,

Wilkening says that while &quot;Diver Down&quot; is &quot;easily the most criticized&quot; of the Van Halen albums fronted by Roth, it has a consistent summery feel, &quot;thanks partially to the series of amazing guitar interludes that turn up between tracks&quot;. &quot;Consequence&quot; write that Van Halen &quot;went pop&quot; for &quot;Diver Down&quot;, in contrast to the aggression of &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, and that as such it is sometimes dismissed by fans of the group&#x27;s harder material. However, the website comment that it charms those who &quot;embraced the (power) pop direction&quot;. They believe that some tracks are led by &quot;some of the most emotive and pleasant guitar work Eddie Van Halen ever recorded&quot;, but believe the album&#x27;s final songs &quot;veer too heavily into David Lee Roth’s showtunes vibe&quot;. Morgan Brown, in &quot;Van Halen: Every Album, Every Song&quot; (2023), considers it to be &quot;a hugely enjoyable lucky dip of a record&quot; that, despite feeling more like &quot;a superior &#x27;leftovers and rarities&#x27; collection than a coherent studio album&quot;, still contains only &quot;terrific&quot; material that together showcases the band&#x27;s exquisite range. Eddie van Halen has since criticized the album for being rushed to meet Warner. Bros&#x27; demands and as a result containing too many covers.

<text>OU812 (pronounced &quot;Oh You Ate One Too&quot;) is the eighth studio album by American rock band Van Halen. It was released in 1988 and is the band&#x27;s second album to feature vocalist Sammy Hagar. Van Halen began work on the album in September 1987 and completed it in April 1988, one month before its release.

Like its predecessor &quot;5150&quot;, &quot;OU812&quot; hit number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, the second of four consecutive #1 studio albums for the band. Spurred by four &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-40 singles (&quot;Black and Blue&quot;, #34; &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot;, #13; &quot;When It&#x27;s Love&quot;, #5; and &quot;Feels So Good&quot;, #35), the album eventually sold over 4 million copies.

The album was remastered by Donn Landee and released on October 6, 2023, as part of &quot;The Collection II&quot;; the four studio albums with Hagar, plus an extra disc of eight rarities from this era.

==Production==
Once the &quot;5150&quot; tour concluded, Eddie Van Halen had some riffs he had been working on and Hagar &quot;had a bunch of lyrics in notebooks that I had been thinking about and writing&quot;, so they decided to work on another album soon. While the album acknowledges Van Halen for writing and performing and Landee for recording, there was no production credit because according to Hagar, &quot;the band pretty much produced the album ourselves. And we weren&#x27;t producers, in the sense that we went in with an idea and told everybody what to do and took control. There just wasn&#x27;t a producer.&quot; The only cover song on the album, Little Feat&#x27;s &quot;A Apolitical Blues&quot;, was coincidentally also done by former Van Halen producer Ted Templeman and Landee, to the point the engineer used the same setup to record Van Halen&#x27;s version.

When Hagar was brought to the studio, Eddie showed a piano and drums demo he recorded with Alex Van Halen, which the band soon developed into the song &quot;When It&#x27;s Love&quot;. Given the musical parts were finished quicker than the lyrics, Hagar took some weeks off and travelled to his Mexican house at Cabo San Lucas to work on more songs. There he found the inspiration for the song &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot;, which borrowed the melody of &quot;Make It Last&quot;, a song Hagar composed for his previous band Montrose, and whose title later named Hagar&#x27;s nightclub in the city. The last song to be developed was &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot;, which Eddie and Hagar composed one night late into the production. However, the last track to which Hagar recorded his vocals was the eventual album opener &quot;Mine All Mine&quot;, as he felt unsure about the lyrics. The deeper metaphysical lyrics to &quot;Mine All Mine&quot; were rewritten seven times, with Hagar saying &quot;it was the first time in my life I ever beat myself up, hurt myself, punished myself, practically threw things through windows, trying to write the lyrics.&quot; Although it was considered a joke song, &quot;Source of Infection&quot; was written about Eddie&#x27;s hospitalization with dengue fever during his vacation in Australia in April 1988, celebrating his seventh wedding anniversary with Valerie Bertinelli.

The working title was &quot;Bone&quot;, which Alex hated. Hagar then decided on &quot;OU812&quot; after seeing this on the side of a delivery truck on the freeway and finding it funny (rumors persist, though, that the title was a disguised response to the title of David Lee Roth&#x27;s 1986 solo album, &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot;). OU812 is seen in &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Next Movie&quot; (1980) on the license plate of the car given to Cheech at the &quot;Comedy House&quot; when he was leaving. It was also scribbled on the cinderblock column on which is mounted the payphone that the cab drivers used in the TV sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978–1983). The album&#x27;s front cover is a homage to the classic cover of &quot;With the Beatles&quot;. The cover features a black and white photo of the band member&#x27;s faces partly hidden in shadows, and is also similar to that of Blue Cheer&#x27;s &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; (1968) and King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;Red&quot; (1974). Album artwork for the back cover is Hugo Rheinhold&#x27;s statuette &quot;Affe mit Schädel&quot;.

The track listing on the back cover is arranged in alphabetical order, instead of in sequence on most releases.

The album is dedicated to Eddie and Alex&#x27;s father, Jan, who died on December 9, 1986, at the age of 66. The inner linings of the album include the words, &quot;This one&#x27;s for you, Pa&quot;. Jan had previously appeared playing clarinet on one track, &quot;Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)&quot;, on Van Halen&#x27;s 1982 album, &quot;Diver Down&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Reviews for &quot;OU812&quot; were initially mixed. Robert Christgau rated the album a C in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which signifies &quot;a record of clear professionalism or barely discernible inspiration, but not both.&quot; He noted that &quot;trading Dave for Sammy sure wrecked their shot at Led Zep of the &#x27;80s--master guitarist, signature vocalist, underrated rhythm section.&quot; However, he stated: &quot;Eddie&#x27;s obsessed with technique, Roth&#x27;s contemptuous of technique, rhythm section&#x27;s got enough technique and no klutz genius. But Sammy . . . like wow. If I can&#x27;t claim the new boy owns them [...], you can&#x27;t deny he defines them.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Fricke rated the album three-and-a-half out of five stars. He said of &quot;Source of Infection&quot;: &quot;While Eddie Van Halen sprays you with a machine-gun succession of speed-metal-guitar arpeggios, Sammy Hagar sends out the party invitations with his usual savoir-faire — &quot;Hey! All right! Whoo!&quot; Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony, of course, take him at his word, shooting into hyper-beat space before you can say, &#x27;Jump&#x27;.&quot; He noted that &quot;Van Halen, contrary to purist grumbling, did not wimp out when Diamond Dave hit the bricks. Nor did the band go — ugh! — pop: the &quot;5150&quot; ladies&#x27; choice &quot;Why Can&#x27;t This Be Love&quot; wasn&#x27;t really a ballad; it was more like Big Rock Melancholia. In fact, all the &quot;5150&quot;-model Van Halen did was replace one mighty mouth with another and trot out some hip, new songwriting tricks.&quot; Still, he stated that &quot;the curve balls [...] don&#x27;t always hit the strike zone. &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; is an unexpected turn into wheat-field-rock country.&quot; Despite this, he concluded that &quot;maybe Eddie and company haven&#x27;t been pushing the envelope, so to speak, far enough in terms of songwriting. But &quot;Mine All Mine&quot; is a good teaser for the future, the slow stuff is classy radio fare, and at its best, &quot;OU812&quot; is a veritable feast of great white rock &amp; roll wow.&quot; Xavier Russell of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was more enthusiastic and called &quot;OU812&quot; &quot;loud, rude, dirty and very much a Van Halen album&quot;.

A retrospective review from AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine was fairly positive. Erlewine stated that &quot;when David Lee Roth fronted the band, almost everything that Van Halen did seemed easy – as big, boisterous, and raucous as an actual party – but Van Hagar makes good times seem like tough work here.&quot; Still, he stated that &quot;the riffs are complicated, not catchy, the rhythms plod, they don&#x27;t rock, and Sammy strains to inject some good times by singing too hard.&quot; However, he concluded that &quot;if it isn&#x27;t as good as &quot;Fair Warning&quot; (even if it&#x27;s nearly not as much fun), it&#x27;s nevertheless the best showcase of the instrumental abilities of Van Hagar.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff defined &quot;OU812&quot; music as &quot;cynical corporate rock&quot; and found the album &quot;over-produced and actually more commonplace&quot; than its predecessor &quot;5150&quot;, implying that &quot;the philosophical soul and warmth&quot; of Van Halen &quot;evaporated when David Lee Roth packed it in.&quot;

In a music magazine interview published a few years after the release of the album, Eddie Van Halen expressed his opinion that the record was not mixed as well as he would have liked: &quot;Sonically it was shit.&quot; Some criticism of the album noted the bass guitar parts are of a low level in the mix compared to the vocals and other instruments. There has been speculation that the thin presence of bass guitar in the mix may be related to the Van Halen brothers&#x27; rumored growing animosity towards bassist Michael Anthony. In later years, Anthony would be forced out of the band and his songwriting credits removed or altered.

<doc id="1070320" wikidata="Q8007229" url="?curid=1070320" title="William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)">
<text>William Craig (2 December 1924 – 24 April 2011) was a Northern Irish unionist politician and solicitor, best known for forming the Unionist Vanguard movement.

==Early life==
From Cookstown, County Tyrone, Craig was educated at Royal School Dungannon, Larne Grammar School and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

After serving in the Royal Air Force (as a Lancaster bomber rear gunner) during World War II, he became a solicitor.

==Politics==
He was active in the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and led the Ulster Young Unionist Council. He was elected to the Stormont Parliament in a by-election in 1960 for Larne, and became a Minister in 1963. He held several portfolios under Terence O&#x27;Neill, eventually as Minister for Home Affairs. His most notable action while in this office was to ban the march of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association on 5 October 1968. He also accused the civil rights movement of being a political front for the IRA.

On 11 December 1968, O&#x27;Neill dismissed Craig when he suspected Craig was a supporter of Ulster nationalism. Craig began to build a power base for himself within unionism, becoming head of the Ulster Loyalist Association. The UUP withdrew the whip from him in May 1970; Craig then began to make plans to form his own political party. The Ulster Vanguard movement was formed on 9 February 1972 under Craig&#x27;s leadership (the Deputy Leaders were the Reverend Martin Smyth and Captain Austin Ardill).

Ulster Vanguard advocated a semi-independent Northern Ireland. Vanguard held a large rally on 18 March 1972 in Belfast&#x27;s Ormeau Park at which Craig said &quot;We must build up the dossiers on the men and women who are a menace to this country, because one day, ladies and gentlemen, if the politicians fail, it may be our job to liquidate the enemy&quot;. Vanguard also staged a two-day strike in protest at the prorogation of the Stormont Parliament.

In April 1972, Vanguard issued a policy statement &quot;Ulster – A Nation&quot; which said that Northern Ireland might have to consider independence. In October, he spoke at a meeting of the Conservative Monday Club, a group of right-wing Conservative MPs at Westminster. He told them he could mobilise 80,000 men to oppose the UK Government, adding: &quot;We are prepared to come out and shoot and kill. I am prepared to come out and shoot and kill, let&#x27;s put the bluff aside&quot;. In March 1973, the Ulster Vanguard became the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party.

The Vanguard Unionists under Craig formed part of the United Ulster Unionist Council which opposed the power-sharing Sunningdale Agreement. Craig was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly created under the Sunningdale Agreement, and he won a seat in the UK Parliament at the February 1974 general election for East Belfast. However, in the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in the mid-1970s, Craig broke with the majority of his party to support voluntary power-sharing with the Social Democratic and Labour Party. The Vanguard Unionists fell apart, with one section forming the United Ulster Unionist Party. Craig led the remains of Vanguard in rejoining the Ulster Unionist Party in 1978, but lost his seat at the 1979 general election.

Craig subsequently broke with the Ulster Unionists once more. When elections were held for the new Northern Ireland Assembly in 1982, Craig revived the name Vanguard for his candidacy in East Belfast. However, he failed to be elected. That marked the effective end of Craig&#x27;s political career.

Many historians have agreed that Craig found it difficult to accept that Northern Ireland had to make social and economic reforms. Craig led opposition to those proposals throughout the premierships of Terence O&#x27;Neill, James Chichester-Clark and Brian Faulkner. Although he showed few intentions when he became the leader of the Unionist Vanguard movement, he showed public intention to form a Northern Ireland Executive in 1975 with the Social Democratic and Labour Party, along with the Alliance Party and Ulster Unionist Party. That is mainly overshadowed due to his early political beliefs and refusal to accept reform and change to Northern Irish society.

==Personal life and death==
In 1960, Craig married Doris Hilgendorff, and they had two children.

After a long period away from public life, Craig died at the Ulster Hospital on 24 April 2011, aged 86, from complications of a stroke he suffered the previous month.

<text>The Cooler Heads Coalition is a politically conservative &quot;informal and ad-hoc group&quot; in the United States, financed and operated by the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The group, which rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, made efforts to stop the government from addressing climate change.

== Operation ==
The Coalition operates a website, and published a blog and e-newsletter &quot;Cooler Heads Digest&quot; (last issued in 2012). It was founded by Consumer Alert.

The Cooler Heads Coalition describes itself as &quot;an informal and ad-hoc group focused on dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the group as &quot;in the vanguard of efforts to cast doubt on the gravity of climate change and thwart government efforts to address it.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has described the Cooler Heads Coalition as &quot;an umbrella organization operated by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonprofit that prides itself on its opposition to environmentalists.&quot;

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the group was for &quot;long dismissed as cranks by mainstream scientists and politicians in both parties&quot; until the group was embraced by Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign.
The Cooler Heads Coalition has been criticized for ties to energy industries that would be affected if the United States enacted any legislation targeted at reducing CO2 emissions.

== Membership ==
Notable members of the Coalition have included:

<doc id="1070326" wikidata="Q636889" url="?curid=1070326" title="Total derivative">
<text>In mathematics, the total derivative of a function at a point is the best linear approximation near this point of the function with respect to its arguments. Unlike partial derivatives, the total derivative approximates the function with respect to all of its arguments, not just a single one. In many situations, this is the same as considering all partial derivatives simultaneously. The term &quot;total derivative&quot; is primarily used when is a function of several variables, because when is a function of a single variable, the total derivative is the same as the ordinary derivative of the function.

==The total derivative as a linear map==
Let formula_1 be an open subset. Then a function formula_2 is said to be (totally) differentiable at a point formula_3 if there exists a linear transformation formula_4 such that

:formula_5

The linear map formula_6 is called the (total) derivative or (total) differential of formula_7 at formula_8. Other notations for the total derivative include formula_9 and formula_10. A function is (totally) differentiable if its total derivative exists at every point in its domain.

Conceptually, the definition of the total derivative expresses the idea that formula_6 is the best linear approximation to formula_7 at the point formula_8. This can be made precise by quantifying the error in the linear approximation determined by formula_6. To do so, write
:formula_15
where formula_16 equals the error in the approximation. To say that the derivative of formula_7 at formula_8 is formula_6 is equivalent to the statement
:formula_20
where formula_21 is little-o notation and indicates that formula_16 is much smaller than formula_23 as formula_24. The total derivative formula_6 is the &quot;unique&quot; linear transformation for which the error term is this small, and this is the sense in which it is the best linear approximation to formula_7.

The function formula_7 is differentiable if and only if each of its components formula_28 is differentiable, so when studying total derivatives, it is often possible to work one coordinate at a time in the codomain. However, the same is not true of the coordinates in the domain. It is true that if formula_7 is differentiable at formula_8, then each partial derivative formula_31 exists at formula_8. The converse does not hold: it can happen that all of the partial derivatives of formula_7 at formula_8 exist, but formula_7 is not differentiable at formula_8. This means that the function is very &quot;rough&quot; at formula_8, to such an extreme that its behavior cannot be adequately described by its behavior in the coordinate directions. When formula_7 is not so rough, this cannot happen. More precisely, if all the partial derivatives of formula_7 at formula_8 exist and are continuous in a neighborhood of formula_8, then formula_7 is differentiable at formula_8. When this happens, then in addition, the total derivative of formula_7 is the linear transformation corresponding to the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives at that point.

==The total derivative as a differential form==
When the function under consideration is real-valued, the total derivative can be recast using differential forms. For example, suppose that formula_45 is a differentiable function of variables formula_46. The total derivative of formula_7 at formula_8 may be written in terms of its Jacobian matrix, which in this instance is a row matrix:
:formula_49
The linear approximation property of the total derivative implies that if
:formula_50
is a small vector (where the formula_51 denotes transpose, so that this vector is a column vector), then
:formula_52
Heuristically, this suggests that if formula_53 are infinitesimal increments in the coordinate directions, then
:formula_54

In fact, the notion of the infinitesimal, which is merely symbolic here, can be equipped with extensive mathematical structure. Techniques, such as the theory of differential forms, effectively give analytical and algebraic descriptions of objects like infinitesimal increments, formula_55. For instance, formula_55 may be inscribed as a linear functional on the vector space formula_57. Evaluating formula_55 at a vector formula_59 in formula_57 measures how much formula_59 &quot;points&quot; in the formula_62th coordinate direction. The total derivative formula_6 is a linear combination of linear functionals and hence is itself a linear functional. The evaluation formula_64 measures how much formula_7 points in the direction determined by formula_59 at formula_8, and this direction is the gradient. This point of view makes the total derivative an instance of the exterior derivative.

Suppose now that formula_7 is a vector-valued function, that is, formula_69. In this case, the components formula_70 of formula_7 are real-valued functions, so they have associated differential forms formula_72. The total derivative formula_73 amalgamates these forms into a single object and is therefore an instance of a vector-valued differential form.

==The chain rule for total derivatives==
The chain rule has a particularly elegant statement in terms of total derivatives. It says that, for two functions formula_7 and formula_75, the total derivative of the composite function formula_76 at formula_8 satisfies
:formula_78
If the total derivatives of formula_7 and formula_75 are identified with their Jacobian matrices, then the composite on the right-hand side is simply matrix multiplication. This is enormously useful in applications, as it makes it possible to account for essentially arbitrary dependencies among the arguments of a composite function.

===Example: Differentiation with direct dependencies===
Suppose that &quot;f&quot; is a function of two variables, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. If these two variables are independent, so that the domain of &quot;f&quot; is formula_81, then the behavior of &quot;f&quot; may be understood in terms of its partial derivatives in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; directions. However, in some situations, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; may be dependent. For example, it might happen that &quot;f&quot; is constrained to a curve formula_82. In this case, we are actually interested in the behavior of the composite function formula_83. The partial derivative of &quot;f&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; does not give the true rate of change of &quot;f&quot; with respect to changing &quot;x&quot; because changing &quot;x&quot; necessarily changes &quot;y&quot;. However, the chain rule for the total derivative takes such dependencies into account. Write formula_84. Then, the chain rule says
:formula_85
By expressing the total derivative using Jacobian matrices, this becomes:
:formula_86
Suppressing the evaluation at formula_87 for legibility, we may also write this as
:formula_88
This gives a straightforward formula for the derivative of formula_83 in terms of the partial derivatives of formula_7 and the derivative of formula_91.

For example, suppose
:formula_92
The rate of change of &quot;f&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; is usually the partial derivative of &quot;f&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot;; in this case,
:formula_93
However, if &quot;y&quot; depends on &quot;x&quot;, the partial derivative does not give the true rate of change of &quot;f&quot; as &quot;x&quot; changes because the partial derivative assumes that &quot;y&quot; is fixed. Suppose we are constrained to the line
:formula_94
Then
:formula_95
and the total derivative of &quot;f&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; is
:formula_96
which we see is not equal to the partial derivative formula_97. Instead of immediately substituting for &quot;y&quot; in terms of &quot;x&quot;, however, we can also use the chain rule as above:
:formula_98

===Example: Differentiation with indirect dependencies===
While one can often perform substitutions to eliminate indirect dependencies, the chain rule provides for a more efficient and general technique. Suppose formula_99 is a function of time formula_100 and formula_101 variables formula_102 which themselves depend on time. Then, the time derivative of formula_103 is
:formula_104

The chain rule expresses this derivative in terms of the partial derivatives of formula_103 and the time derivatives of the functions formula_102:
:formula_107

This expression is often used in physics for a gauge transformation of the Lagrangian, as two Lagrangians that differ only by the total time derivative of a function of time and the formula_101 generalized coordinates lead to the same equations of motion. An interesting example concerns the resolution of causality concerning the Wheeler–Feynman time-symmetric theory. The operator in brackets (in the final expression above) is also called the total derivative operator (with respect to formula_100).

For example, the total derivative of formula_110 is

:formula_111

Here there is no formula_112 term since formula_7 itself does not depend on the independent variable formula_100 directly. 

==Total differential equation==

A &quot;total differential equation&quot; is a differential equation expressed in terms of total derivatives. Since the exterior derivative is coordinate-free, in a sense that can be given a technical meaning, such equations are intrinsic and &quot;geometric&quot;.

==Application to equation systems==

In economics, it is common for the total derivative to arise in the context of a system of equations. For example, a simple supply-demand system might specify the quantity &quot;q&quot; of a product demanded as a function &quot;D&quot; of its price &quot;p&quot; and consumers&#x27; income &quot;I&quot;, the latter being an exogenous variable, and might specify the quantity supplied by producers as a function &quot;S&quot; of its price and two exogenous resource cost variables &quot;r&quot; and &quot;w&quot;. The resulting system of equations
:formula_115
:formula_116
determines the market equilibrium values of the variables &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. The total derivative formula_117 of &quot;p&quot; with respect to &quot;r&quot;, for example, gives the sign and magnitude of the reaction of the market price to the exogenous variable &quot;r&quot;. In the indicated system, there are a total of six possible total derivatives, also known in this context as comparative static derivatives: , , , , , and . The total derivatives are found by totally differentiating the system of equations, dividing through by, say , treating and as the unknowns, setting , and solving the two totally differentiated equations simultaneously, typically by using Cramer&#x27;s rule.

<doc id="1070327" wikidata="Q1800014" url="?curid=1070327" title="Phoebus cartel">
<text>The Phoebus cartel was an international cartel that controlled the manufacture and sale of incandescent light bulbs in much of Europe and North America between 1925 and 1939. The cartel took over market territories and lowered the useful life of such bulbs, which is commonly cited as an example of planned obsolescence.

Corporations based in Europe and the United States, including Tungsram, Osram, General Electric, Associated Electrical Industries, and Philips, incorporated the cartel on January 15, 1925 in Geneva, as &quot;Phœbus S.A. Compagnie Industrielle pour le Développement de l&#x27;Éclairage&quot; (French for &quot;Phoebus plc Industrial Company for the Development of Lighting&quot;). Although the group had intended the cartel to last for thirty years (1925 to 1955), it ceased operations in 1939 with the outbreak of World War II. 

Following its dissolution, light bulbs continued to be sold at the 1,000-hour life standardized by the cartel.

== History ==
Osram, Philips, Tungsram, Associated Electrical Industries, , Compagnie des Lampes, International General Electric, and the GE Overseas Group created and joined the Phoebus cartel, holding shares in the Swiss corporation proportional to their lamp sales.

Osram founded a precursor organisation in 1921, the &quot;Internationale Glühlampen Preisvereinigung&quot;. When Philips and other manufacturers entered the American market, General Electric reacted by setting up the &quot;International General Electric Company&quot; in Paris. Both organisations co-ordinated the trading of patents and market penetration. Increasing international competition led to negotiations among all the major companies to control and restrict their respective activities in order not to interfere in each other&#x27;s spheres.

The Phoebus cartel&#x27;s compact was intended to expire in 1955, but it was instead nullified in 1940 after World War II made coordination among the members impossible.

== Purpose ==

The cartel lowered operational costs and worked to standardize the life expectancy of light bulbs at 1,000 hours (down from 2,500 hours), while raising prices without fear of competition. The reduction in lifespan has been cited as an example of planned obsolescence. Regulators in the UK and some independent engineers have noted that there are benefits to shorter bulb lifespans, as shorter-life bulbs can be brighter for the same wattage. Nevertheless, both internal comments from cartel executives and later findings by a US court suggest that the cartel&#x27;s direct motivation for the change was to increase profits by forcing customers to buy bulbs more frequently.

The cartel tested their bulbs and fined manufacturers for bulbs that lasted more than 1,000 hours. A 1929 table listed the amount of Swiss francs paid that depended on the exceeding hours of lifetime. Anton Philips, head of Philips, said to another cartel executive, &quot;After the very strenuous efforts we made to emerge from a period of long life lamps, it is of the greatest importance that we do not sink back into the same mire by paying no attention to voltages and supplying lamps that will have a very prolonged life.&quot;

In 1951, the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission in the United Kingdom issued a report to Parliament, which disputed the idea that the Phoebus cartel engaged in planned obsolescence, stating that &quot;there can be no absolutely right life [of light bulbs] for the many varying circumstances to be found among the consumers in any given country, so that any standard life must always represent a compromise between conflicting factors&quot;.

In 1949, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey found General Electric to have violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, in part because of their activities as part of the Phoebus Cartel. As part of the decision, while acknowledging that &quot;it should be borne in mind that the life of a lamp is inextricably related to the power of its light&quot;, it nonetheless found that because of General Electric&#x27;s dominant industry position and lack of competition it had the power to determine bulb lifespan across the entire industry, and that General Electric&#x27;s main consideration in setting the lifespans of bulbs was profit. The court used this as one of the factors for ultimately determining that General Electric had violated the Act.
==In popular culture==
In &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1973), Thomas Pynchon wrote about &quot;Byron the Bulb&quot;, an anthropomorphic eternal lightbulb who fights against the Phoebus cartel. Pynchon&#x27;s novel has been credited with bringing the Phoebus cartel to the public eye.

<doc id="1070328" wikidata="Q1754426" url="?curid=1070328" title="Van Halen III">
<text>Van Halen III is the eleventh studio album by American rock band Van Halen, released on March 17, 1998, by Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Mike Post and Eddie Van Halen, it was the band&#x27;s first studio album in three years after &quot;Balance&quot; (1995), the band&#x27;s only studio album to feature vocalist Gary Cherone, and the last to feature bassist Michael Anthony, who only appears on three of the album&#x27;s songs while the rest of the bass parts are played by Eddie Van Halen; his son Wolfgang replaced Anthony on subsequent recordings. Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s extensive involvement in the album&#x27;s production, instrumentation and writing have led some, including Anthony, to consider &quot;Van Halen III&quot; more of a solo project than a collective band effort. Clocking in at over 65 minutes, &quot;Van Halen III&quot; is their longest album.

The album reached No. 4 in the United States and achieved Gold status, but was a relative commercial disappointment for the band, whose previous four albums had all been chart-topping, multi-platinum sellers, though the lead single &quot;Without You&quot; performed well on radio. Critical and fan reaction was also largely negative, with criticism directed at its songwriting, production, band performances and length. The lukewarm reception prematurely halted work on a follow-up album with Cherone, who departed soon after. &quot;Van Halen III&quot; was the band&#x27;s last studio album for fourteen years until their 2012 comeback &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;.

==Production==
The album&#x27;s title refers to Van Halen&#x27;s third recorded line-up, and to the band&#x27;s first two album titles, &quot;Van Halen&quot; and &quot;Van Halen II&quot;. Vocalist Sammy Hagar left the group in 1996, and was briefly replaced by original frontman David Lee Roth. Eventually, Roth departed and was replaced by Cherone who had performed with the group Extreme before their amicable breakup.

None of its material is featured on &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, the band&#x27;s 2004 compilation.

As a producer, Eddie brought his friend Mike Post. The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;How Many Say I&quot;, was an unusual acoustic piano ballad featuring Eddie on lead vocals, and Cherone on backing vocals: Eddie declared he was forced into singing, and added harmonies so he would not perform alone.

&quot;Van Halen III&quot; makes minimal use of Michael Anthony on bass guitar. Anthony only played bass on &quot;Without You&quot;, &quot;One I Want&quot; &amp; &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;; Eddie Van Halen recorded bass for the rest of the album tracks that feature bass. After Michael Anthony&#x27;s departure from Van Halen, he confirmed that Eddie Van Halen dictated to him how to play bass on this record. Anthony also said by the time of making this album, Eddie was playing the bass more as well as drums. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if Eddie was basically making a solo record, which is what &quot;Van Halen III&quot; seemed like to me.&quot; In recent years, it has been revealed that Alex Van Halen was absent from sessions on the album due to personal problems at the time and did not play on any tracks.

A track entitled &quot;That&#x27;s Why I Love You&quot; was dropped at the last minute in favor of &quot;Josephina&quot;, with &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot; featuring on the &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; film soundtrack.

&quot;I would have preferred to tour with them and then put out a record,&quot; Cherone told KNAC. &quot;It would have been a better idea to establish myself first and then hit the studio with the band… There were some great ideas and some little gems but it was not a great record. I had fun but at times it was like being a stranger in a strange land.&quot;

The album cover is a still picture from stock footage of Frank &quot;Cannonball&quot; Richards, a vaudeville and sideshow performer known for his act of getting shot in the gut with a cannonball.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Van Halen III&quot; debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 4, with 191,000 copies sold. The album has sold over 800,000 copies as of 2022. The album&#x27;s only significant radio hit was &quot;Without You&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart on the March 7, 1998, issue of &quot;Billboard&quot;, and remained there for six weeks. Other songs receiving airplay on rock radio were &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot; and &quot;One I Want&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Reception for &quot;Van Halen III&quot; was mostly mixed to negative. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from &quot;AllMusic&quot; stated the album fails to break away from the formula that Van Halen had exhausted over 20 years and &quot;suffers from the same problems as Hagar-era Van Halen – limp riffs, weak melodies, and plodding, colorless rhythms.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B grade rating, saying, &quot;judging from the renewed intensity of Eddie’s guitar playing throughout much of &quot;III&quot;, having a merely competent, relatively ego-free singer seems to have reinvigorated his muse&quot; but goes on to say &quot;How Many Say I&quot;, a song Eddie sang lead vocals on, was &quot;cringeworthy&quot; and &quot;unintentionally hilarious&quot;. Greg Kot from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it 2 stars out of 5 noting, &quot;Cherone sounds disconcertingly like Hagar, full of spleen-busting bluster and incapable of understatement&quot;, and &quot;When the band plays it heavy, it mires itself in a Seventies tar pit, with only the chorus of &#x27;Without You&#x27; achieving any sort of pop resonance.&quot; Kot compliments Eddie&#x27;s vocals saying, &quot;&#x27;How Many Say I&#x27; finds the guitarist singing in a disarmingly appealing, nicotine-stained voice over a moody piano melody.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer Paul Verna summed up &quot;III&quot; as &quot;a wasted opportunity to breathe life into a now-tired formula&quot;.

<doc id="1070331" wikidata="Q182185" url="?curid=1070331" title="Lockheed JetStar">
<text>The Lockheed JetStar (company designations L-329 and L-1329; designated C-140 in US military service) is a business jet produced from the early 1960s to the 1970s. The JetStar was the first dedicated business jet to enter service, as well as the only such airplane built by Lockheed. It was also one of the largest aircraft in the class for many years, seating ten plus two crew. It is distinguishable from other small jets by its four engines, mounted on the rear of the fuselage, and the &quot;slipper&quot;-style fuel tanks fixed to the wings.

==Development==
The JetStar originated as a private project within Lockheed, with an eye to winning a United States Air Force (USAF) requirement that was later dropped due to budget cuts. Lockheed decided to continue the project on its own for the business market.

The first two prototypes were equipped with two Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engines, the first of these flying on 4 September 1957. The second of these was also equipped with the wing-mounted &quot;slipper tanks&quot;, which was originally to be an option. Lockheed attempted to arrange a contract to produce the Orpheus in the US, but when these negotiations failed it re-engined the second prototype with four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT12s in 1959. The outer engines were mounted beside the inner ones, an arrangement that was later used on the Vickers VC10 and Ilyushin Il-62 airliners. The slipper tanks were removed and placed on the first prototype. The JT12 fit proved successful and was selected for the production versions, the first of which flew in mid 1960. These versions entered commercial service in 1961.

Noise regulations in the United States and high fuel consumption led to the development of the 731 JetStar, a modification program which added new Garrett TFE731 turbofan engines with a number of detail changes. It has redesigned larger external fuel tanks that sit with their upper surfaces flush with the wing, rather than being centered on it. The cockpit area has a somewhat more &quot;modern&quot; looking nose and window arrangement. The 731 JetStar modification program was so successful that Lockheed produced 40 new JetStars, designated the JetStar II, from 1976 to 1979. The JetStar IIs were factory-new aircraft with the turbofan engines and revised external fuel tanks. Both 731 JetStars and JetStar IIs have greatly increased range, reduced noise, and better runway performance compared to the original JetStars.

JetStar production totaled 204 aircraft by final delivery in 1978. Most original JetStars have been retired, but many 731 JetStars and JetStar IIs are still flying in various roles, mainly as corporate and private jets.

==Design==


The JetStar has a fairly typical business jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance in front and behind the wing. The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along the front of the wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of ice accumulated in flight. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines&#x27; jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area at the base of the fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.

The JetStar is a relatively heavy aircraft for its class, at 44,500 lb (19,278 kg). Maximum cruising speed is Mach 0.8, or 567 mph (912 km/h) at 21,000 ft (6,401 m). Range is typically quoted as 2,500 mi (4,023 km) with a 3,500 lb (1,588 kg) payload. Typically, interiors feature seating for eight with a full-sized lavatory, or a slightly denser arrangement for ten. The JetStar is one of the few aircraft of its class which allow a person to walk upright in the cabin, although to do this the aisle is sunk slightly so that the seats are raised on either side. The windows are relatively large.

==Operational history==
The first prototype served as the personal transport of Lockheed&#x27;s Vice President of Advanced Development Projects Kelly Johnson for some time. Elvis Presley owned two JetStars at different times; the second was named &quot;Hound Dog II&quot; and is on display at Graceland. Frank Sinatra also owned one. Additionally, one JetStar belonged to U.S. President Richard Nixon, then to the Shah of Iran and finally, to Puerto Rican boy band Menudo.

Sixteen JetStars were produced for the USAF; five &quot;C-140As&quot; were flight inspection aircraft for the Air Force Communications Service and were used to perform airborne testing of airport navigational aids (navaids) from 1962 onwards. They began service during the Vietnam War and remained in service until the early 1990s. The &quot;Flight Check&quot; C-140As were combat-coded aircraft that could be distinguished from the VIP transport version by their distinctive paint scheme. The C-140As were deployed to southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, where, in addition to their more usual navaid testing, they would loiter off the coast and act as communications relays between the Pentagon and the battlefield. The last C-140A to be retired was placed on static display at Scott AFB, Illinois.

An additional eleven airframes were designated &quot;C-140B&quot;, although the first of these predated the C-140As when it was delivered in 1961. The C-140Bs were used to transport personnel by the Military Airlift Command. Six of the aircraft (tail numbers 61-2488, 61-2489, 61-2490, 61-2491, 61-2492 and 61-2493) were operated as VIP transports by the 89th Military Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base. These VIP aircraft were designated as &quot;VC-140Bs&quot;. During the presidency of Jimmy Carter, he used a dedicated VC-140B extensively for short trips and it was known within the Special Air Missions Wing as &quot;Peanut One.&quot; Upon retirement, one airframe (#89001) was placed on a static pedestal in front of the Joint Base Andrews air terminal. Members of the VIP transport fleet occasionally served as Air Force One during the 1970s and 1980s. Several other countries, such as Germany and Canada, have used military JetStars as transports for their heads of state, heads of government, and other VIPs.

The last operational JetStar (N313JS) was retired in December 2019, and is now preserved at the Aviation History &amp; Technology Center in Marietta, GA. However, in November 2020, a Jetstar II (N700RM) was flown from Texas to Oregon. That particular aircraft will be disassembled in Klamath Falls. In December 2020, another Jetstar II (N710RM) was also ferried from Conroe, Texas to Klamath Falls, Oregon.

<text>Châtillon-sur-Seine () is a commune of the Côte-d&#x27;Or department, eastern France.
The Musée du Pays Châtillonnais is housed in old abbey of Notre-Dame de Châtillon, within the town, known for its collection of pre-Roman and Roman relics (especially the famous Vix Grave).

==History==
Some ruins on an eminence above the town mark the site of a château of the dukes of Burgundy. Nearby stands the church of St Vorles of the 10th century, but with many additions of later date; it contains a sculptured Holy Sepulchre of the 16th century and a number of frescoes. In a fine park stands a modern château built by Marshal Marmont, duke of Ragusa, born at Châtillon in 1774. It was burnt in 1871, and subsequently rebuilt.

Châtillon anciently consisted of two parts, Chaumont, belonging to the duchy of Burgundy, and Bourg, ruled by the bishop of Langres; it did not coalesce into one town until the end of the 16th century. It was taken by the English in 1360 and by Louis XI in 1475, during his struggle with Charles the Bold. Châtillon was one of the first cities to adhere to the League, but suffered severely from the oppression of its garrisons and governors, and in 1595 made voluntary submission to Henry IV. It is associated with the abortive conference of 1814 between the representatives of Napoleon and the Allies.

During World War II the German garrison were forced to withdraw after a successful operation by the Special Air Service operating in the nearby forest in late August 1944.

<text>The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam, () is a separatist group within the Ahmadiyya movement that formed in 1914 as a result of ideological and administrative differences following the demise of Hakim Nur-ud-Din, the first Caliph after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Members of the Lahore Ahmadiyya movement are referred to by the majority group as ghayr mubāyi&#x27;īn (&quot;non-initiates&quot;; &quot;those outside of allegiance&quot; to the caliph) and are also known colloquially as Lahori Ahmadis.

Adherents of the Lahore Ahmadiyya movement believe Ghulam Ahmad to be a &quot;Mujaddid&quot; (reformer) and also affirm his status as the promised Messiah and Mahdi, but diverge from the main Ahmadiyya position in understanding his prophetic status to be of a Sufistic or mystical rather than theologically technical nature. Moreover, adherents of the Lahore Ahmadiyya movement do not profess allegiance to the Ahmadiyya Caliphate and are administered, instead, by a body of people called the &quot;Anjuman&quot; (Council), headed by an &quot;Amīr&quot; (President).

According to estimates from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada and author Simon Ross Valentine, there are between 5,000 and 10,000 Lahori Ahmadis in Pakistan and as many as 30,000 worldwide, thereby representing less than 0.2% of the total Ahmadiyya population. Similar to the &#x27;Qadiani&#x27; Ahmadis, the &#x27;Lahori&#x27; Ahmadis hold annual conferences or conventions called &quot;jalsas&quot; where community updates, aims, topics of interest, and challenges are discussed and emphasized to help direct policy-planning goals and initiatives for the respective groups or jamaats.

== History ==
Soon after the death in 1914 of Hakim Nur-ud-Din, Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s first successor, Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s son, was chosen in Qadian at the age of 25 to lead the movement as his second successor. However, a group, which included some of the movement&#x27;s senior figures, led by Maulana Muhammad Ali, opposed his succession and refrained from pledging their allegiance to him, eventually leaving Qadian and relocating to Lahore. Muhammad Ali and his supporters&#x27; differences with Mahmud Ahmad centred mainly upon the nature of Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s prophethood—and consequentially the status of Muslims who did not accept him— as well as the form the leadership should take within the movement, viz. the relative authority of the successor (or &quot;khalīfa&quot;) and the Central Ahmadiyya Council (&quot;Anjuman&quot;). Although a clash of personalities between the dissenters and Mahmud Ahmad has also been postulated owing to the latter&#x27;s relative youth, inexperience and poor academic background. The disputes surrounding these, and other related issues, eventually led to a veritable secession and the formation of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement.

Adopting a position more congruent with the mainstream of Sunni Islam regarding the issues of dispute, Muhammad Ali led the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement as &quot;Amīr&quot; (President) from 1914 until his death in 1951. Since then it has been led by four &quot;Amīrs&quot;, the current being Abdul Karim Saeed Pasha. Relative to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, some mainstream Muslim opinion towards the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement and its literature has been more accepting, with some Orthodox Sunni scholars considering the members of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement as Muslims. Notwithstanding, the group was subsumed within Pakistan&#x27;s anti-Ahmadi laws declaring Ahmadis to be non-Muslims and prohibiting them from any public expression of the Islamic faith.

==Difference in viewpoints==
===On prophethood===
Ahmadis universally concur in the belief that Ghulam Ahmad was both the promised Mahdi and Messiah foretold by Muhammad to appear in the end times, and that his prophetic qualities were neither independent nor separable from those of Muhammad. What this entailed theologically, however, became an issue of contention within the early Ahmadiyya movement. Muhammad Ali held that the type of prophecy described by Ghulam Ahmad in reference to himself did not make him a prophet in the technical sense of the word as used in Islamic terminology, amounted to nothing more than sainthood (&quot;walāya&quot;) and that Islamic mystics preceding Ghulam Ahmad had similarly described experiences of prophecy within Islam in the context of their relationship with Muhammad. Unlike the majority Muslim belief which expects the physical return of Jesus, the Lahore Ahmadiyya affirm the absolute cessation of prophethood, and believe that no prophet can appear after Muhammad, neither a past one like Jesus, nor a new one.

In contrast, Mahmud Ahmad posited that Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s messianic claim and role were qualitatively distinct to the claims of the saints preceding him in Islam and that his prophetic status, though completely subservient to Muhammad, being a mere reflection of his own prophethood and not legislating anything new, still made him technically a prophet irrespective of the type of prophethood or the adjectives added to qualify it. Accordingly, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community believes that prophecy gifted as a result of perfect obedience and self-effacement in devotion to Muhammad does not infringe upon the finality of his prophetic mission, though it affirms the advent of only one such promised end-times prophetic figure (Ghulam Ahmad) as having appeared in accordance with scriptural prophecies. Such a prophetic status, though not independent, is nonetheless technically classed as prophethood in as much as it involves an individual who is given knowledge of the hidden, predicts future events and is called a prophet by Allah.

===On other Muslims===
A closely linked point of contention surrounded the status of Muslims who did not accept Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s claim. Muhammad Ali and his supporters, rejecting indiscriminate pronouncements of disbelief (&quot;Kufr&quot;) concerning them, drew a distinction between those who were neutral in the controversy and those who actively rejected and opposed Ghulam Ahmad, or pronounced him an infidel. The former could not in any sense be termed disbelievers (&quot;kafirs&quot;) while the latter were guilty only of rejecting a particular commandment of the Islamic faith—namely that pertaining to belief in the promised Messiah—which would render them &quot;fasiqun&quot; (those who depart from the right path) in distinction to disbelief in a basic element of the faith which would have excluded them from the Muslim community (&quot;Ummah&quot;). Muhammad Ali repudiated the idea of declaring the entire Muslim community as disbelievers, a term which, according to him, could not apply to non-Ahmadi Muslims indiscriminately, something which he accused Mahmud Ahmad of doing.

Affirming a different typology of disbelief, i.e. that which subsists outside of Islam in contrast to that which does not entail exclusion from it, although Mahmud Ahmad held that Muslims who did not accept Ghulam Ahmad technically fell into the category of disbelief, and that rejection of him ultimately amounted to rejection of Muhammad, he utilised the broad connotations and usages of the Arabic word &quot;Kafir&quot; to stress that his use of the term in reference to such Muslims did not carry its demotic meaning, but rather meant to signify doctrinal deviancy and to express that only Ahmadis were &quot;true&quot; Muslims. For him, since such Muslims as had not accepted one appointed by God (&quot;ma&#x27;mur minallah&quot;) within Islam were neither deniers of God nor Muhammad, they were still part of the Muslim community and were Muslims only in the sense that they belonged to the &quot;Ummah&quot; of Muhammad and as such were entitled to be treated as members of Muslim society (&quot;mu&#x27;ashira&quot;), which, according to him, was different from saying that they are Muslims and not &quot;kafirs&quot;. He held, therefore, that non-Ahmadi Muslims were to be classified as disbelievers albeit within the remit of Islam and not in the sense that they had a religion other than Islam; and, further, that the movement passed no judgement as to their fate in the hereafter and never proactively expressed this opinion of them. Although he refused demands from outside the movement to accept that the term &quot;Kafir&quot; did not apply to non-Ahmadi Muslims, Mahmud Ahmad did maintain that such Muslims were not deemed to be outside the pale of Islam.

===On succession===
Towards the end of 1905, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad published a short treatise anticipating his own death entitled &quot;Al-Wasiyyat&quot; (or &quot;The Will&quot;) in which he established the &quot;Sadr Anjuman Ahmadiyya&quot; (Central Ahmadiyya Council), an executive body set up to administer the movement and to collect and distribute funds to support the propagation of Islam. Ghulam Ahmad presided over the Council himself until his death in 1908. After his death, Hakim Nur-ud-Din was unanimously chosen to succeed him and presided over the Council&#x27;s appointed president. Muhammad Ali and his supporters held that Ghulam Ahmad, in &quot;The Will&quot;, had designated the Council as a consultative institution to be his successor. Viewing as autocratic the idea of one individual wielding absolute authority within the Community and demanding total obedience from it, they repudiated the idea of a &quot;khilāfah&quot; (caliphate) within the movement, preferring what they saw as a more democratic system established by Ghulam Ahmad himself and, accordingly, vested the Community&#x27;s authority in the Council as an administrative body. No individual had the power to revoke the decisions reached by the majority of the Council that would remain paramount and binding, something which they believed was in keeping with Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s instructions for the movement&#x27;s administration after his death. Further, according to them, since leadership of the movement was no longer divinely appointed after Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s death, the obligation to pledge allegiance to his successor had also lapsed and had become a voluntary act.

As opposed to the foregoing approach, Mahmud Ahmad, who assumed the movement&#x27;s leadership as the second successor the day after Nur-ud-Din&#x27;s death, held that Ghulam Ahmad had envisioned a system of divinely ordained caliphate to succeed him, similar to that believed to have commenced following the death of Muhammad, under whose authority the Council was to operate. Accordingly, he favoured centralised, singular authority through the system of caliphate which, in his view, was religiously indispensable and to which the Community&#x27;s allegiance was necessary. Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s successors, according to him, continued to be divinely ordained and commanded obedience from the Community. This, he contended, was clearly indicated in &quot;The Will&quot; as well as Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s other works and was an arrangement which, according to him, had existed throughout the period of Nur-ud-Din&#x27;s leadership who not only spoke of himself as the &quot;khalīfat al-masīh &quot; (caliph; lit. successor of the Messiah) but declared that he had attained this office by divine appointment rather than community choice. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, accordingly, vests its religious and organisational authority in the caliph as Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s divinely chosen successor.

===On dresscode===
Dr. Zahid Aziz a prominent Lahori Ahmadi Scholar from the UK, on the Lahore Ahmadiyya Blog when asked about the Hijab and Beard in 2015, dismissed these as &quot;cultural practices&quot; and not a part of Islam which is in contrast to the mainstream Ahmadiyya Muslim Community&#x27;s view on the matter that it is absolutely compulsory, the term most commonly used by Ahmadi Muslims is &#x27;Purdah&#x27;.

===On the virgin birth of Jesus===
While the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community holds the view that Jesus born of the virgin Mary is a fundamental belief in Islam, many pioneer and prominent Lahori Ahmadi Muslims deny that the virgin birth indeed occurred and stated that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad had no issues with his followers holding different opinions on such matters

However, sources do suggest that in comparison to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, the Lahore Ahmadiyya population is relatively very small. In particular, it is estimated that there may be between 5,000 and 10,000 Lahori Ahmadis in Pakistan and possibly up to 30,000 worldwide, thereby representing less than 0.2% of the worldwide Ahmadiyya population.

<doc id="1070358" wikidata="Q470369" url="?curid=1070358" title="Kolín">
<text>Kolín (; ) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 33,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==

Kolín consists of ten municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Kolín I (1,484)
*Kolín II (12,755)
*Kolín III (3,552)
*Kolín IV (5,218)
*Kolín V (5,846)
*Kolín VI (406)
*Sendražice (1,641)
*Šťáralka (81)
*Štítary (787)
*Zibohlavy (180)
==Etymology==
The name Kolín probably comes from the Old Czech verb &quot;koliti&quot;, i.e. &quot;to hammer poles&quot;, and is related to the location of Starý Kolín in the often flooded area at the confluence of the Klejnárka and Elbe rivers. The soil in the vicinity of the confluence was strengthened with the help of wooden poles.

==Geography==
Kolín is located about east of Prague. It lies in a fertile landscape of the Central Elbe Table lowland. The Elbe River flows through the town. In the eastern part of the municipal territory is Sandberk, an artificial lake created by flooding a sandstone quarry.

==History==
Ptolemy&#x27;s world map of the 2nd century mentions &quot;Budorgis&quot; in the area of today&#x27;s Kolín.

Kolín was founded by King Ottokar II in the 13th century by relocation, when Starý Kolín (&quot;Old Kolín&quot;) was threatened by floods and the king decided to move the settlement. The first written mention of Kolín is from 1261, when it was mentioned that Přelouč obtained town privileges, just like Kolín and Kouřim have. It lay on a trade route Prague–Český Brod–Čáslav–Moravia.

Jewish people settled in Kolín in the 14th century. In 1437–1438, a castle was founded in Kolín. It was built on the ruins of a burned down monastery. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, it was damaged, and in the 17th century, it was rebuilt as a brewery. In 1911, the castle burned down and its Renaissance look disappeared.

The 1757 Battle of Kolín was fought during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and in 1944 a refinery in Kolín was bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. Zyklon B for the Nazi concentration camps was produced there.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
In Kolín is the smaller part of Kolín-Ovčáry Industrial Zone, known mostly for the factory of the automobile manufacturing company Toyota Motor Manufacturing. As of 2020, TMM employed 2,400 people. It is the most important employer in the region.

Kolín is home to the packaging and paper manufacturer, OTK company.

==Transport==
Kolín is connected with Prague by the I/12 road. The I/38 road (the section from Kutná Hora to Nymburk) also passes through the town.

Kolín is a railway junction. The Kolín railway station is located on the major lines Prague–Olomouc and Prague–Brno, which further continue to Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. It also lies on the intraregional lines Prague–Havlíčkův Brod and Ústí nad Labem–Kolín.

==Sights==

The historical centre of the town, formed by the Karlovo Square and surrounding streets, has many Gothic and Baroque buildings. The most important monument is the Church of Saint Bartholomew, protected as a national cultural monument. It has an early Gothic core from the second half of the 13th century. In the mid-14th century, it was rebuilt by the architect Peter Parler. A separate bell tower was built next to the church at the end of the 15th century. In 1878–1910, the Gothic appearance of the church was restored by Josef Mocker.

A notable landmark of the town square is the town hall. Originally a Gothic house from the 15th century, it was rebuilt in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1887.

In Kolín is the original Jewish ghetto with a synagogue from 1696. It is the second oldest and most valuable synagogue in Bohemia. The Jewish cemetery is one of the oldest and largest Jewish cemeteries in Bohemia. It was established in the first half of the 15th century.

<doc id="1070360" wikidata="Q7352513" url="?curid=1070360" title="Robin Hood Line">
<text>The Robin Hood Line is a railway line running from Nottingham to Worksop, Nottinghamshire, in England. The stations between Shirebrook and Whitwell (inclusive) are in the county of Derbyshire.

Passenger services are operated by East Midlands Railway. The line in its present form opened to passengers in stages between 1993 and 1998. Following the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, the line had been freight-only. The cuts had left Mansfield as one of the largest towns in Britain without a railway station.

==History==
The majority of the current Robin Hood Line re-uses the former Midland Railway (MR) route from Nottingham to Worksop. However, due to rationalisation leading to track removal in order to save the costs of maintaining the tunnel north of Annesley, the through route was severed in the 1970s.

Northwards from Nottingham, the freight-only line remained intact as far as Newstead, where it had served the now closed Newstead Colliery.

Southwards from Worksop, the line followed the old MR route as far as Sutton-in-Ashfield. Between Sutton-in-Ashfield and Kirkby-in-Ashfield, the line was diverted in 1972 to take the former Great Northern Railway (GNR) route through the area.
This allowed British Rail to sell land right in the centre of Kirkby-in-Ashfield whilst keeping a freight route through the town. After crossing the town on the GNR route, the line re-joined the old MR route to Pye Bridge, near Ironville but the connection between Kirkby-in-Ashfield and Newstead was closed and the tunnel filled in.

When plans for the Robin Hood Line were drawn up, it was vital in the interest of keeping costs down to make as much use of the existing infrastructure as possible so, rather than trying to buy back the land to rebuild the line through the centre of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, the existing GNR diversion was kept and a new partly single track stretch of railway built to re-create the missing link between Kirkby-in-Ashfield and Newstead.

North of Newstead, at Annesley, both the Great Central Railway (GCR) and the Midland Railway had driven tunnels through the picturesque Robin Hood Hills but, since both lines closed, both tunnels had been filled in. The GCR&#x27;s tunnel had been at a lower level than the MR&#x27;s and so was much longer but it had previously been shared with the GNR and the elevation was a good match for the route through Kirkby. In the end it proved cheaper to re-excavate the MR&#x27;s tunnel, which was found to be in excellent condition and build the new connection on a gradient between the two levels.
The new service from Nottingham to Newstead opened in 1993, although Bulwell station opened only in 1994. It was extended to Mansfield Woodhouse in 1995, with Kirkby-in-Ashfield station opening in 1996. The through passenger route from Nottingham to Worksop opened in 1998.

In 2004 the section between Bulwell and Hucknall was singled to allow space for the new Nottingham Express Transit tramway, which follows the route as far north as Hucknall and opened in March 2004.

==Service==

As of March 2020, the Robin Hood Line operates a Monday to Saturday service between 05:40 and 22:20. During the day, trains run at half-hourly intervals between Nottingham and Mansfield Woodhouse, with one service an hour continuing to Worksop, and the full journey taking 67 minutes.

A Sunday service began on 7 December 2008, with ten trains running between Nottingham and Mansfield Woodhouse between 09:15 and 22:30. Four of those continued to Worksop.
The Sunday service was funded by Derbyshire County Council and Nottinghamshire County Council. An understanding was made with the Department for Transport that, if the patronage reached an agreed threshold after two years, it would consider taking over the service and incorporate it within the East Midlands Trains franchise. However, this service was not a commercial success north of Mansfield Woodhouse, and Nottinghamshire County Council decided to reduce its funding and prioritise running a reduced Sunday service from 22 May 2011. The service runs eight times each Sunday between Nottingham and Mansfield Woodhouse and return.

==Proposed extension==
Just north of Shirebrook station is a junction with a freight branch line that was used for coal traffic to High Marnham power station via Warsop, Edwinstowe and Ollerton. Following closure of the power station the line is disused but has been kept open and fully maintained as a test track for driver training.
In mid-2009 Nottinghamshire County Council commissioned a feasibility study to consider a plan to extend the Robin Hood Line along this route by extending the current hourly service between Nottingham and Mansfield Woodhouse to Ollerton, calling at Shirebrook, Warsop and Edwinstowe (for Center Parcs Sherwood Forest holiday resort). Nottinghamshire CC have remained keen on the idea, and met with the rail minister Claire Perry in March 2016 to press for the scheme to be adopted. The new line would be about long, but as much of it is used for driver training, only about of new track would be required, and the infrastructure is still in good condition.
A report produced for Nottinghamshire CC in February 2016 suggested that the likely costs of reinstatement, including the rebuilding of the three stations, would be between £18.9M and £24.5M, with signalling accounting for more than half of that figure. Operating costs were estimated to be some £1.6M per year, with revenue from fares expected to be a little over half of that, and the rest to be found from subsidies. A condition of the awarding of a new East Midlands franchise for operating the line in 2019 was that the operator was required to produce a business case for the extension to Ollerton.

There are also plans to reinstate passenger trains over the freight-only line from to the closed Pye Bridge railway station on the Erewash Valley line. The line, which has been named the Maid Marian line, has been championed by Ashfield District Council, as it would greatly improve access to the proposed Toton HS2 station for residents in the area. In February 2020, they commissioned a public consultation on the idea, and in November 2020 submitted a bid for the second round of the government&#x27;s Restoring Your Railway fund, to cover the cost of a feasibility study. The project was one of fifteen schemes which were successful in obtaining such funding.

<text>Bonginkosi Dlamini (born 24 April 1977), known professionally as Zola 7, is a South African kwaito musician, actor, writer, TV presenter, and poet. Dlamini began his career as an actor for Yizo Yizo, achieving national recognition and began releasing best selling music albums on township lives. He also starred in the Academy Award winning film Tsotsi in 2005, for which he also wrote the musical score. 

Zola is a respected philanthropist. Through his show &quot;Zola 7&quot;, which aired on SABC 1, he assisted numerous individuals in achieving their personal and social development goals. Notable among his initiatives is the establishment of libraries and motivations

==Biography and early life==
Bonginkosi Dlamini was born on 24 April 1977 and grew up in Zola, a township of Soweto. His artist name is based on his hometown. Dlamini&#x27;s father, believed to be part of the Mchunu clan, abandoned the family, leaving his mother to care for him and his older brother and sister when they were young.

==Actor==
Zola 7 became well known for his role as the notorious gangster Papa Action in the second season of the television series &quot;Yizo Yizo&quot;. The Papa Action character was already popular from the first season, where it had been portrayed by another performer, Ronnie Nyakale. Zola 7 resembled Nyakale, and his performance only increased the popularity of the role. He also performed the score and played a role in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Tsotsi&quot; (2005), and the movie &quot;Drum&quot; (2004). Zola 7 also has a prominent role in the documentary &quot;SHARP! SHARP! : the Kwaito story&quot; (2003) directed by Aryan Kaganof. In 2015 and 2016 Zola 7 had minor roles in the television series Isibaya, as well as Zabalaza.

==Television==

=== &quot;Zola 7&quot; ===
&quot;Zola 7&quot; was a television show presented by Zola airing from 2002 to 2010 on SABC1. Each episode focused on a young person, who with support from Zola realised his or her dream.

=== &quot;Utatakho&quot; ===
&quot;Utatakho&quot; was a television programme produced by Connect TV in 2015 which aired on Mzansi Magic and was presented by Zola. In each episode Zola helped participants to find or reconnect with their biological fathers. Zola accompanied participating sons to meetings with their fathers and facilitated conversation. Additionally, a professional counsellor was present to mediate. Having been to child court over the custody for his own children, Zola can relate to the show&#x27;s content on a personal level.

=== &quot;Hope with Zola&quot; ===
&quot;Hope with Zola&quot; is a docu-reality show on Moja Love. The programme started in October 2018 and is hosted by Zola. Each episode is 30 minutes and focuses on the alleviation of social problems like youth unemployment, housing shortage or insufficient community libraries. Unlike his former show, &quot;Zola 7&quot;, which focused on individuals, &quot;Hope with Zola&quot; addresses communities and aimes specifically for sustainable development.

==Music==
Bonginkosi Dlamini has enjoyed success as a Kwaito musician. Lance Stehr of Ghetto Ruff records has referred to Zola as &quot;the second biggest brand in the country next to Nelson Mandela.&quot;
Zola not only performs but also writes and produces some of his own music, signing to the independent label Ghetto Ruff records. Zola is also the owner of the music company Guluva Entertainment.

Originally, Zola was not a fan of Kwaito music, because it &quot;had no message.&quot; He has taken upon himself to change this, viewing himself as a role model. &quot;I want to inspire a guy from the ghetto so he can stop hanging around in the corner begging and try to get some life.&quot; In the song &quot;Mdlwembe&quot;, which literally means problem child, he expresses his feelings about the neighborhood he grew up in. He talks about the horrible quality of life of the township, particularly the extreme level crime and violence. &quot;Beware of the Zola boys; we do crime for money&quot; demonstrates Zola&#x27;s past and also the perpetual anguish of life in a ghetto. Today, Zola works on behalf of younger performers, helping them to be integrated into the music industry. He is a pioneer in social action and benefit projects in South Africa.

Kwaito is branded as apolitical, and often associated with the advancement of personal wealth, glamorized gangster lifestyle, and frivolous consumption themes found in much of Jamaican Dancehall and Rap. The genre is associated with a new political freedom gain since the end of apartheid in South Africa and less political strife. The form of the Kwaito produced by Zola is in that case an anomaly in that it is very much politically charged and contains a social message.

Zola raps in isiZulu with a high usage of Tsotsitaal. The latter is the vernacular slang in South Africa. This infusion of colloquial dialect with a national language allows for better interaction between the artists and the community South Africans in lower socio-economic classes who live in the townships and speak Tsotsitaal can relate to Kwaito music differently from Cape Town hip hop or US hip hop because of the lyrics. Additionally many of his songs describe situations of life in the townships, particularly Soweto.

On 7 July 2007 Zola performed at the South African leg of Live Earth.

==Radio==
Dlamini is part of the newly launched Massiv Metro, an online station pioneered by DJ Sbu.

<text>Neckartailfingen is a municipality in Germany, located approximately south of Stuttgart. It is located on the river Neckar.

== History ==
Neckartailfingen was first mentioned in 1090 in the Hirsau codex (Codex Hirsaugiensis) as &quot;Tagelvingen&quot;. Built by order of the Hirsau abbey, the town&#x27;s landmark church—the Romanesque Martinskirche—was probably completed in the year 1111.
In 1536, the town became Protestant, together with the office Nürtingen and received in 1541 the first village school of the former district Nürtingen.

In the Thirty Years&#x27; War Neckartailfingen was destroyed after the Battle of Nördlingen (1634) by the infamous dragoons of colonel Walter Butler of Roscrea. Only after a few years the fugitive inhabitants returned and slowly re-built their village again.

==Economy and infrastructure==
===Traffic===
Neckartailfingen has always been an important transit point. At the time of the stagecoaches Neckartailfingen was an important station for changing horses.

Until 1976, the Deutsche Bundesbahn maintained a station at the Plochingen-Tübingen railway, which was about two kilometers away from the place.

In 1995, the bypass of the Bundesstraße 297 was completed. This road runs between the municipality and the Neckar in a tunnel.

The public transport is operated by the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart. There are the bus lines 188 (to Nürtingen) and 190 (to Aichtal). The line 75 (to Bernshausen or Stuttgart-Degerloch stops just on the outskirts.

== Education ==
Neckartailfingen has with the Liebenau school a primary school. In addition, there are three kindergartens in the place. A music school is for the pupils from the village and the surrounding areas.

The soprano Lore Wissmann was born in the place.

<doc id="1070391" wikidata="Q7473" url="?curid=1070391" title="Emperor Taizong of Song">
<text>Zhao Jiong (20 November 939 – 8 May 997), known as Zhao Guangyi from 960 to 977 and Zhao Kuangyi before 960, also known by his temple name as the Emperor Taizong of Song, was the second emperor of the Song dynasty of China. He reigned from 976 to his death in 997. He was a younger brother of his predecessor Emperor Taizu, and the father of his successor Emperor Zhenzong.

Why Emperor Taizong succeeded his brother rather than Emperor Taizu&#x27;s grown sons (Zhao Dezhao and Zhao Defang, who both died in their twenties during his reign) is not entirely understood by later historians. According to official history, his succession was confirmed by Emperor Taizu on their mother Empress Dowager Du&#x27;s deathbed as a result of her instruction. A popular story dating back from at least the 11th century suggests that Emperor Taizong murdered his brother in the dim candlelight when the sound of an axe was allegedly heard. Whatever the truth, Zhao Guangyi had been prefect of the Song capital Kaifeng since 961 where he gradually consolidated power. He was the only living prince during Emperor Taizu&#x27;s reign (as Prince of Jin) and placed above all grand councilors in regular audiences.

In the first three years of his reign, he intimidated the Qingyuan warlord Chen Hongjin and Wuyue king Qian Chu into submission and easily conquered the Northern Han, thus reunifying China proper for the first time in 72 years. However, subsequent irredentist wars to conquer former Tang dynasty territories from the Liao dynasty in the north and the Early Lê dynasty in the southeast proved disastrous: after the failures in the Battle of Gaoliang River and the Battle of Bạch Đằng, the Sixteen Prefectures and Northern Vietnam (at least in their entirety) would remain beyond Han control until the Ming dynasty in the 14th century.

Emperor Taizong is remembered as a hardworking and diligent emperor. He paid great attention to the welfare of his people and made the Song Empire more prosperous. He adopted the centralization policies of the Later Zhou, which include increasing agricultural production, broadening the imperial examination system, compiling encyclopaedias, expanding the civil service and further limiting the power of &quot;jiedushis&quot;.

All subsequent emperors of the Northern Song were his descendants, as well as the first emperor of the Southern Song. However, from Emperor Xiaozong onwards, subsequent emperors were descendants of his brother, Emperor Taizu. This largely stemmed from the Jingkang Incident, whereby most of Emperor Taizong&#x27;s descendants were abducted by the Jin dynasty, forcing Emperor Gaozong to seek a successor among Taizu&#x27;s descendants, as Gaozong&#x27;s only son had died young.

==Early life==
Emperor Taizong was born in 939 in Kaifeng. After his brother Emperor Taizu took the throne, he was appointed prefect of Kaifeng. He was the Prince of Jin in his brother&#x27;s reign.

==Succeeding the throne and suspected fratricide==
Emperor Taizong succeeded the throne in 976 after the death of his elder brother, Emperor Taizu, who was 49 and had no recorded illness. It is rather unusual in Chinese history for a brother rather than the son to succeed the throne, so the event fueled popular belief that foul play was involved.

According to official history, Empress Dowager Du before her death in 961 asked the 34-year-old Emperor Taizu to promise that his brother would succeed him so as to ensure the continuation of the Song dynasty. She reportedly asked Emperor Taizu, &quot;Do you know why you came to power? It was because Later Zhou had a seven-year-old emperor!&quot; The so-called &quot;Golden Shelf Promise&quot; () was also allegedly recorded and sealed, by secretary Zhao Pu and reopened after Emperor Taizong&#x27;s succession to prove the latter&#x27;s legitimacy.

Emperor Taizu&#x27;s eldest son, Zhao Dezhao, was already 25 years old in 976, certainly old enough to handle an emperor&#x27;s duties. Also suspicious is that Zhao Pu, banished in 973 by Emperor Taizu for allegations of corruption, returned to the capital in 976 and was made the chancellor in 977.

Wen Ying, a Buddhist monk who lived in the era of Emperor Taizong&#x27;s grandson, Emperor Renzong, wrote an account about the last night of Emperor Taizu. According to this account, he was dining and drinking with Emperor Taizong, then still the &quot;Prince of Kaifeng&quot;, beside some candles. Palace eunuchs and maids standing in a distance saw that Emperor Taizong&#x27;s shadow on the window moved a lot and appeared antsy. It was getting late and several inches of snow had fallen on the inside of the hall. Then they heard an axe chopping the snow, with Emperor Taizu saying, &quot;Do it right! Do it right!&quot; Soon enough Emperor Taizu was heard snoring. Several hours later, he was pronounced dead by his brother, who spent the night in his palace. This legend has been referred to as &quot;sound of the axe in the shadow of the flickering candle&quot; () and proved to be popular to this day.

Modern historians were unable to find any concrete evidence suggesting murder; however they generally accept that the &quot;Golden Shelf Promise&quot; was fraud fabricated by Emperor Taizong and Zhao Pu.

Also worth mentioning is the suicide of Zhao Dezhao, Emperor Taizu&#x27;s eldest son, three years after his father&#x27;s death. During Emperor Taizong&#x27;s first campaign against the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, Zhao Dezhao was leading an army when rumours spread that Emperor Taizong had disappeared, and that Zhao Dezhao should be the new emperor. Upon hearing that, Emperor Taizong did not award the troops when they returned. When Zhao Dezhao asked him, Emperor Taizong barked back, &quot;You do that when you become the new emperor!&quot; According to this account, Zhao Dezhao immediately went to his palace and killed himself and when Taizong heard about the suicide, he was very sad and hugged the corpse crying.

Emperor Taizu&#x27;s second son, Zhao Defang, died in 981 from an unidentified illness. Just 22, he was unusually young. Emperor Taizong was very sad and visited Defang&#x27;s grave and cancelled meetings for 5 days. During the same year, Emperors Taizong and Taizu&#x27;s younger brother, Zhao Tingmei (previously known as Zhao Guangmei and Zhao Kuangmei), was also stripped of his title &quot;Prince of Qi&quot; and sent to the Western Capital. He died three years later. Moreover, when Emperor Taizu&#x27;s widow Empress Song died, her body was not buried with her late husband and not given the recognition according to tradition.

After Emperor Taizong&#x27;s ascension to the throne, there were persistent doubts as to the legitimacy of the succession, and a popular prophecy arose that Taizu&#x27;s descendants will rightfully return to the throne one day (). This prophecy proved true when Taizu&#x27;s seventh-generation descendant Xiaozong became emperor after the capture of most of Taizong&#x27;s line by the Jurchens during the Jingkang incident and Gaozong, the first emperor of the Southern Song dynasty, whose own son Zhao Fu died young, lacked an heir.

==Military campaigns==

===Conquering Northern Han===
Emperor Taizong personally led the campaign against Northern Han in 979 and ordered the flooding of enemy cities by releasing the Fen River. The Northern Han ruler Liu Jiyuan was forced to surrender, thus ending all the kingdoms and dynasties in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

===First campaign against the Liao dynasty===
Having conquered Northern Han in 979, Emperor Taizong took advantage of the momentum and launched another military campaign against the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. In May 979, Emperor Taizong embarked on his campaign from Taiyuan and took Zhuo and Yi Prefectures easily. He besieged Yanjing (present-day Beijing) after the success. However, the siege failed when the Liao defending general Yelü Xuegu defended the fortress firmly.

Concurrently, Liao reinforcements led by Yelü Xiuge arrived from the Gaoliang River region, west of Yanjing. Emperor Taizong ordered his army to attack the reinforcements. Initially, he received reports that the Liao army was suffering heavy casualties. He ordered a full assault on the Liao army as he thought that the whole battle was under his control. Just then, Yelü Xiuge and Yelü Xiezhen&#x27;s armies attacked from two sides. Yelü Xiuge concentrated on attacking Emperor Taizong&#x27;s main camp. Emperor Taizong was shocked and evacuated from the battlefield. During the evacuation, the Song army was divided and obliterated by the Liao cavalry.

Amidst the onslaught, Emperor Taizong fled towards Yi Prefecture and arrived there safely with his generals protecting him. He sustained an injury from an arrow and was unable to ride on his horse and had to travel by carriage back to Ding Prefecture. Emperor Taizong ordered a retreat after that. The Song army was without a commander as Emperor Taizong was separated from his troops. The troops suggested that Emperor Taizu&#x27;s eldest son, Zhao Dezhao (Emperor Taizong&#x27;s nephew), be the new emperor. Emperor Taizong&#x27;s suspicions were raised when he heard that and eventually he ordered Zhao Dezhao to commit suicide.

The Battle of Gaoliang River was significant as it was one of the major contributing factors to the Song dynasty&#x27;s decision to adopt a defensive stance. The early Song army suffered its first major defeat in battle. Meanwhile, Emperor Taizong was also troubled by the possibility that Zhao Dezhao would launch a coup. After the battle, Emperor Taizong personally inspected and focused more on the development and strengthening of his military forces. He ignored his subjects&#x27; advice and regarded state affairs as of lower importance. He also limited the power and control that the imperial family and military officers had over the army.

===Second campaign against the Liao dynasty===
After the death of Emperor Jingzong of Liao in 982, the 12-year-old Emperor Shengzong of Liao ascended to the throne of the Liao Dynasty. As Emperor Shengzong was too young to rule the kingdom, Empress Dowager Xiao became the regent. Emperor Taizong decided to launch the second campaign against Liao in 986, following the advice of his subjects.

During this time, Zhao Yuanzuo, Taizong&#x27;s oldest son became insane after the death of his uncle, Zhao Tingmei, and that he was not invited to the Double Night Daylight Feast which ultimately caused Yuanzuo to burn down the palace. As a result, Taizong, under the pressure of his censors demoted Yuanzuo to commoner status and exiled him. This, was changed when 100 officials rejected Yuanzuo&#x27;s exile and pressured Taizong to let Yuanzuo remain in the palace. Three officials who had responsibility for Yuanzuo asked to be punished by Taizong in which Taizong said &quot;This son, even I have been unable to reform through my teaching. How could you guide him?&quot; in response.

In 983, the practice of officials tutoring imperial princes began under his reign. One notable case was Emperor Taizong&#x27;s son Zhao Yuanjie and his tutor Yao Tan (935–1003) in which Yao constantly berated the young prince for being idle and lazy causing resentment from the prince. Yao attempted to complain to Taizong who said &quot;Yuanjie is literate and enjoys learning; that should be sufficient to make him a worthy prince. If when young he is immoderate, then it is necessary to have entreaties to rein in his ridicule. But if you slander him without good reason, how is that going to help him?&quot; However, Yuanjie under peer pressure from his friends feigned illness and began neglecting his duties. Concerned, Taizong checked the Prince&#x27;s progress daily. He summoned Yuanjie&#x27;s wet nurse after the Prince still was &quot;ill&quot; for a month with the wet nurse stating &quot;The Prince is basically not sick; it&#x27;s just that with Yao Tan checking up on him, he can seldom follow his inclinations, and thus has become sick.&quot; This enraged Emperor Taizong ordering her to be caned.

Emperor Taizong remained in Bianjing and directed the war there without personally entering the battlefield. He split the army into three sections – East, Central and West. The East Army was led by Cao Bin, the Central Army by Tian Zhongjin and the West Army by Pan Mei and Yang Ye. All the three armies would attack Yanjing from three sides and capture it. The campaign was termed as the Yongxi Northern Campaign as it took place in the third year of the Yongxi era of Emperor Taizong&#x27;s reign.

The three armies scored some victories initially but they became more divided later as they acted individually without cooperation. Cao Bin took the risk by attacking without the support of the other two armies. He succeeded in taking Zhuo Prefecture but the lack of food supplies forced him to retreat. As there was miscommunication between the three armies, the East Army attacked Zhuo Prefecture again. However, this time, Empress Dowager Xiao and Yelü Xiuge each led an army to support Zhuo Prefecture. The East Army was inflicted with a crushing defeat and almost completely destroyed.

Emperor Taizong was aware that the failure of the East Army would affect the entire campaign and he ordered a retreat. He ordered the East Army to return, the Central Army to guard Ding Prefecture and the West Army to guard four prefectures near the border. Following the defeat of the East Army, the Liao army led by Yelü Xiezhen attacked them as they retreated. The West Army led by Pan Mei met Yelü Xiezhen&#x27;s army at Dai Prefecture and faced another defeat at the hands of the Liao army. The two commanders of the West Army started to argue about retreating. Yang Ye proposed that they should retreat since the East and Central Armies had already lost the advantage following their defeats. However, the other generals on Pan Mei&#x27;s side began to doubt Yang&#x27;s loyalty to Song as Yang Ye used to serve Northern Han. Yang Ye led an army to face the Liao troops but they were trapped and Yang committed suicide eventually. Pan Mei was supposed to arrive with reinforcements to support Yang but he failed to do so.

Emperor Taizong ordered another retreat following the Song armies&#x27; defeats by Yelü Xiuge and Yelü Xiezhen. The failure of the second campaign was attributed to the miscommunication between the three armies and their failures to operate together. Besides, Emperor Taizong had also restricted the decisions of his generals as he had arbitrarily planned the whole campaign against Liao and his generals had to adhere to his orders strictly. These failures led to internal rebellions which were crushed swiftly.

In 988, the Liao armies led by Empress Dowager Xiao attacked the Song border again. Emperor Taizong did not order a counter-attack and merely instructed the troops to defend firmly.

==Later reign after 988==
Emperor Taizong felt that he could not surpass his brother (Emperor Taizu) in terms of military conquests and achievements and decided to focus more on developing his dynasty internally and establish his legacy. He implemented a series of economic and literary reforms which were better than his brother&#x27;s. He also initiated many construction projects and inducted new systems absent in Emperor Taizu&#x27;s reign.
Emperor Taizong died in 997 after reigning for 21 years at the age of 57. He was succeeded by his third son, who became Emperor Zhenzong.

===Economy===
====Chunhua period (990-994)====
With the rise of monopolies, local officials focused on collecting industrial and commercial taxes as a main daily duty. During the Song dynasty, this led to a system where tax collection influenced rewards, punishments, and job status. Officials reported their performance and financial balances starting with Emperor Taizong&#x27;s Chunhua period.

The government, under Emperor Taizong, aimed to collect stable tax amounts based on tax targets starting in the third year of the Chunhua period and covering various taxes. This practice of collecting taxes continued in succeeding governments of the Song dynasty.

<doc id="1070392" wikidata="Q1632797" url="?curid=1070392" title="Norris Dam">
<text>Norris Dam is a hydroelectric and flood control structure located on the Clinch River in Anderson County and Campbell County, Tennessee, United States. The dam was the first major project for the Tennessee Valley Authority, which had been created in 1933 to bring economic development to the region and control the rampant flooding that had long plagued the Tennessee Valley. The dam was named in honor of Nebraska Senator George Norris (1861–1944), a longtime supporter of government-owned utilities in general, and of TVA in particular. The infrastructure project was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

Norris Dam is a straight concrete gravity-type dam. The dam is 1860 feet (570 m) long and 265 feet (81 m) high. Norris Lake, the largest reservoir on a tributary of the Tennessee River, has 33,840 acres (137 km2) of water surface and 809 miles (1302 km) of shoreline. The dam has a maximum generating capacity of 126 megawatts.

==Location==
The Clinch River flows southwestward for from its headwaters in Virginia through the rugged, sparsely populated hills of northeastern Tennessee before emptying into the Tennessee River near Kingston. Norris Dam is located just over upstream from the mouth of the Clinch, immediately downstream from the river&#x27;s confluence with Cove Creek, which joins the river from the northwest. The reservoir includes parts of Anderson, Campbell, Union, Claiborne, and Grainger counties. Norris Reservoir spans a stretch of the Clinch from the dam to River Ridge at the Claiborne-Grainger county line. The reservoir also covers the lower of the Powell River, which empties into the Clinch upstream from Norris Dam. The dam&#x27;s tailwaters are part of Melton Hill Lake, which stretches for along the Clinch from Norris to Melton Hill Dam.

Norris Freeway, a section of U.S. Highway 441 widened in the 1930s to aid in dam construction, crosses the top of Norris Dam and connects the area to Interstate 75 at Rocky Top, Tennessee to the west and Knoxville, Tennessee to the south. Along with the reservation maintained by TVA for the operation of Norris Dam, most of the lower Norris Reservoir is surrounded by conservation lands, including Norris Dam State Park adjacent to the reservation, the Cove Creek Wildlife Management Area across the lake to the north, and the Chuck Swan State Forest, which protects a largely undeveloped area a few miles upstream.

==Background and construction==
As early as 1911, the present site of Norris Dam—initially called the &quot;Cove Creek site&quot;—was identified as a prime location for a sizeable dam. Several government and private entities believed that a dam in the upper Tennessee Valley, working in conjunction with dams at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, could provide badly needed flood control to East Tennessee and help keep the Tennessee River consistently navigable year-round. In the early 1920s, several entities—including the Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCo), the Knoxville Power &amp; Light Company, and Union Carbide— applied for permits to build a dam at the Cove Creek site, although all were eventually withdrawn or rejected. Part of the opposition was from Senator Norris, who advocated a government-sponsored dam at the site, arguing that a private entity would be almost wholly concerned with power generation rather than flood control and coordination with projects elsewhere in the valley. Norris proposed constructing a network of dams throughout the valley to help regulate its outflow into the lower Mississippi River. Throughout the late 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made several proposals to build a dam at the site, but all were rejected by Congress or vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge.

The Tennessee Valley Authority was formed in 1933 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal legislation. The act authorizing TVA&#x27;s establishment (signed on May 18, 1933) authorized TVA to immediately begin construction on a dam at the Cove Creek site. On July 30, TVA renamed the Cove Creek project for Senator Norris and began preparations for the dam&#x27;s construction. As the agency lacked any engineering or dam construction experience, it relied heavily on the Army Corps&#x27; original design, and received ample consulting from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Hungarian-American architect Roland Wank (1898–1970) revised the initial plans from Bureau of Reclamation engineers, and gave the poured-concrete Norris Dam a modernist style, which was controversial and advanced for the era of construction, but the result would eventually succeed in elevating Roland Wank to the position of Chief Architect for TVA from 1933 through 1944. Construction began on October 1, 1933.

The building of Norris Dam and its accompanying reservoir required the purchase of over of land. 2,841 families and 5,226 graves were relocated. The community of Loyston, located about upstream from the dam site, was entirely inundated. Approximately one-third of Caryville, at the head of the reservoir&#x27;s Cove Creek embayment, was flooded and a number of structures in the town had to be moved. Several smaller earthen dams were built along reservoir tributaries to house fish hatcheries. As the project called for the construction of recreational areas along the lakeshore, TVA built two supplemental dams—Caryville Dam and Big Ridge Dam—to impound Cove Lake and Big Ridge Lake, respectively, and ensure these small lakes would remain filled year-round. The Civilian Conservation Corps built recreational facilities and aided in the removal of various structures. The town of Norris, Tennessee was initially built as a planned community to house the workers involved in the construction of this dam.

Norris Dam was completed and the gates closed on March 4, 1936, constructed at a cost of $36 million (equivalent to $ in ). The dam&#x27;s first generator went online on July 28, 1936. Although Norris was the first dam built by TVA, it is not the oldest dam owned and operated by the agency. TVA subsequently purchased the assets of the former Tennessee Electric Power Company, including some dams which had been built before Norris Dam.

The building of Norris Dam and the changes it brought to the region inspired films, books, stage plays, and songs. Folk songs from the construction period express enthusiasm for the benefits that the dam project brought to the region. Notable visitors to the dam included President Franklin D. Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, journalist Ernie Pyle, Swiss architect Le Corbusier, track star Jesse Owens, and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1941, the dam was the subject of a photography exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

==Legacy==
The project&#x27;s intent of providing aid to residents of the Clinch and Powell watershed has been argued by scholars and historians, specifically regarding the TVA&#x27;s acquisition of roughly of farmland, and the displacement of an estimated 3,000 families and 5,300 graves. Many of the dead buried in cemeteries that were to be flooded by the dam reservoir were disinterred and reburied in four &quot;re-interment cemeteries&quot; established by the TVA: Baker&#x27;s Forge Memorial Cemetery, Cumberland View Cemetery, Big Barren Memorial Cemetery, and New Loyston Memorial Cemetery.

Union County, the most negatively impacted county of the Norris Project, would encounter the inundation of the unincorporated town of Loyston and other scarce communities of the Big Valley region of Union County. The town of Big Barren and the settlement of Baker&#x27;s Forge were also inundated. After the project&#x27;s completion, the Big Valley region of Union County, promised its electrification by the project&#x27;s end, would not receive electricity until the late 1940s and early 1950s. Some of the displaced in the aftermath of the Norris Project would commit suicide, unable to bear the stress of the loss of their lifestyles.

<text>A magnon is a quasiparticle, a collective excitation of the spin structure of an electron in a crystal lattice. In the equivalent wave picture of quantum mechanics, a magnon can be viewed as a quantized spin wave. Magnons carry a fixed amount of energy and lattice momentum, and are spin-1, indicating they obey boson behavior.

== Brief history ==
The concept of a magnon was introduced in 1930 by Felix Bloch in order to explain the reduction of the spontaneous magnetization in a ferromagnet. At absolute zero temperature (0 K), a Heisenberg ferromagnet reaches the state of lowest energy (so-called ground state), in which all of the atomic spins (and hence magnetic moments) point in the same direction. As the temperature increases, more and more spins deviate randomly from the alignment, increasing the internal energy and reducing the net magnetization. If one views the perfectly magnetized state at zero temperature as the vacuum state of the ferromagnet, the low-temperature state with a few misaligned spins can be viewed as a gas of quasiparticles, in this case magnons. Each magnon reduces the total spin along the direction of magnetization by one unit of formula_1 (the reduced Planck constant) and the magnetization by formula_2, where formula_3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. This leads to Bloch&#x27;s law for the temperature dependence of spontaneous magnetization:
: formula_4
where formula_5 is the (material dependent) critical temperature, and formula_6 is the magnitude of the spontaneous magnetization.

The quantitative theory of magnons, quantized spin waves, was developed further by Theodore Holstein and Henry Primakoff, and then by Freeman Dyson. Using the second quantization formalism they showed that magnons behave as weakly interacting quasiparticles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics (bosons). A comprehensive treatment can be found in the solid state textbook by Charles Kittel or the early review article by Van Kranendonk and Van Vleck.

Direct experimental detection of magnons by inelastic neutron scattering in ferrite was achieved in 1957 by Bertram Brockhouse. Since then magnons have been detected in ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, and antiferromagnets.

The fact that magnons obey the Bose–Einstein statistics was confirmed by the light scattering experiments done during the 1960s through the 1980s. Classical theory predicts equal intensity of Stokes and anti-Stokes lines. However, the scattering showed that if the magnon energy is comparable to or smaller than the thermal energy, or formula_7, then the Stokes line becomes more intense, as follows from Bose–Einstein statistics. Bose–Einstein condensation of magnons was proven in an antiferromagnet at low temperatures by Nikuni &quot;et al&quot;. and in a ferrimagnet by Demokritov &quot;et al.&quot; at room temperature. In 2015 Uchida &quot;et al.&quot; reported the generation of spin currents by surface plasmon resonance.

== Paramagnons ==
Paramagnons are magnons in magnetic materials which are in their high temperature, disordered (paramagnetic) phase. For low enough temperatures, the local atomic magnetic moments (spins) in ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic compounds will become ordered. Small oscillations of the moments around their natural direction will propagate as waves (magnons). At temperatures higher than the critical temperature, long range order is lost, but spins will still align locally in patches, allowing for spin waves to propagate for short distances. These waves are known as a paramagnon, and undergo diffusive (instead of ballistic or long range) transport.

The concept was first proposed based on the spin fluctuations in transition metals, by Berk and Schrieffer and Doniach and Engelsberg, to explain additional repulsion between electrons in some metals, which reduces the critical temperature for superconductivity.

== Properties ==
Magnon behavior can be studied with a variety of scattering techniques. Magnons behave as a Bose gas with no chemical potential. Microwave pumping can be used to excite spin waves and create additional non-equilibrium magnons which thermalize into phonons. At a critical density, a condensate is formed, which appears as the emission of monochromatic microwaves. This microwave source can be tuned with an applied magnetic field.

<text>Young&#x27;s Literal Translation (YLT) is a translation of the Bible into English, published in 1862. The translation was made by Robert Young, compiler of &quot;Young&#x27;s Analytical Concordance to the Bible&quot; and &quot;Concise Critical Comments on the New Testament&quot;. Young used the Textus Receptus (TR) and the Masoretic Text (MT) as the basis for his translation. He wrote in the preface to the first edition, &quot;It has been no part of the Translator&#x27;s plan to attempt to form a New Hebrew or Greek Text—he has therefore somewhat rigidly adhered to the received ones.&quot; Young produced a &quot;Revised Version&quot; of his translation in 1887, but he stuck with the Received Text. He wrote in the preface to the Revised Edition, &quot;The Greek Text followed is that generally recognized as the &#x27;Received Text,&#x27; not because it is thought perfect, but because the department of Translation is quite distinct from that of textual criticism, and few are qualified for both. If the original text be altered by a translator, (except he give his reasons for and against each emendation,) the reader is left in uncertainty whether the translation given is to be considered as that of the old or of the new reading.&quot; A new Revised Edition was released ten years after Robert Young&#x27;s death on October 14, 1888. The 1898 version was based on the TR, easily confirmed by the word &quot;bathe&quot; in Revelation 1:5 and the word &quot;again&quot; in Revelation 20:5. The &quot;Publishers&#x27; Note to the Third Edition&quot; explains, &quot;The work has been subjected to a fresh revision, making no alteration on the principles on which the Translation proceeds, but endeavouring to make it as nearly perfect in point of accuracy on its present lines as possible.&quot; A major revision of Young&#x27;s Literal Translation in contemporary English, called the Literal Standard Version, was released in 2020.

== Translation philosophy ==
The &quot;Literal Translation&quot; is, as the name implies, a very literal translation of the original Hebrew and Greek texts. The Preface to the Second Edition states:

Therefore, Young used the present tense in many places in which other translations use the past tense, particularly in narratives. For example, the YLT version of Genesis begins as follows:

Young&#x27;s Literal Translation in the 1898 edition also consistently renders the Hebrew tetragrammaton (divine name) throughout the Old Testament as &quot;Jehovah&quot;, instead of the traditional practice of representing the tetragrammaton in English as &quot; in small capitals, but editions prior to 1898 do say &quot; in small capitals.

== Assessment ==

Young&#x27;s translation is closer to the Hebrew than the better-known versions of this passage in English. The Revised Standard Version (RSV), which is based on Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, for example, treats verses 1–3 in this way:

Young&#x27;s usage of English present tense rather than past tense has been supported by scholars ranging from the medieval Jewish rabbi Rashi (who advised, &quot;[If] you are going to interpret [this passage] in its plain sense, interpret it thus: At the beginning of the creation of heaven and earth, when the earth was (or the earth being) unformed and void [...] God said, &#x27;Let there be light.) to Richard Elliott Friedman in his translation of the Pentateuch in &quot;The Bible with Sources Revealed&quot; (2002).

The translation is not perfectly literal. It renders one passage as &quot;And on the first of the Sabbaths&quot; while it translates another as &quot;And on the first of the week&quot; even though the two phrases are identical in the Greek texts. To quote the preface, &quot;Every effort has been made to secure a comparative degree of uniformity in rendering the original words and phrases. Thus, for example, the Hebrew verb (נתן &quot;give, put, set, etc.&quot;), which is rendered by the King James&#x27; translators in different ways... has been restricted and reduced to , and so with many others. It is the Translator&#x27;s ever-growing conviction, that even this smaller number may be reduced still further.&quot; David Dewey, in &quot;A User&#x27;s Guide to Bible Translations&quot;, mentions that Young&#x27;s &quot;method of translating Hebrew tenses makes his Old Testament in places virtually unreadable.&quot;

===&quot;Eternity&quot; or &quot;age&quot;===

Another important feature of YLT is its treatment of the Hebrew word () and the Greek word (). These two words have basically the same meaning, and YLT translates them and their derivatives as &quot;age&quot; or &quot;age-enduring&quot;. Other English versions most often translate them to indicate eternality (eternal, everlasting, forever, etc.). However, there are notable exceptions to this in all major translations, such as: &quot;I am with you always, to the end of the age&quot; (NRSV), the word &quot;age&quot; being a translation of . Rendering to indicate eternality in this verse would result in the contradictory phrase &quot;end of eternity&quot;, so the question arises whether it should ever be so. Proponents of universal reconciliation point out that this has significant implications for soteriology and the problem of hell. However, &quot;age&quot; and &quot;age-enduring&quot; imply indeterminacy which may be either timeless and atemporal or pertaining to an indefinite period of time, the former (but not the latter) meaning having been acquired by the words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

While it has been argued that &quot;eternity&quot; and &quot;eternal&quot; also have other meanings including &quot;endless period of time&quot; and &quot;endless in time&quot; respectively, this is rarely the case in late antique texts, where the word would be used to designate endless duration.

Compare the following passages, quoted from YLT with words corresponding to &quot;age&quot; or &quot;age-enduring&quot; emphasised:

<text>The Tokomairaro River is located in Otago, New Zealand. It flows southeast for some 50 kilometres (30 mi), reaching the Pacific Ocean at Toko Mouth 50 kilometres (30 mi) south of Dunedin. The town of Milton is located on the Tokomairaro&#x27;s floodplain, close to the junction of its two main branches (which run past the north and south ends of the town).

The name of the river is Māori, and translates roughly as &#x27;place where canoe must be poled&#x27; (a possible reference to the method needed to travel through the extensive wetlands, instead of the usual paddling). The Tokomairaro River is prone to seasonal flooding during the heavy rainfall months, August to October. Local industrial buildings have been forced to build high concrete walls around their property to reduce flood damage each year.

The spelling of the river changed from &quot;Tokomairiro River&quot; to &quot;Tokomairaro River&quot; on 28 July 2016. Both spellings have been in use since mid-1800s, however &quot;Tokomairaro&quot; was deemed to be correct. Milton&#x27;s main school, which is named for the river, retains the former spelling.

<text>Mondovì (; , ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; (township) in Piedmont, northern Italy, about from Turin. The area around it is known as the Monregalese.

The town, located on the Monte Regale hill, is divided into several &quot;rioni&quot; (ancient quarters): Piazza (the most ancient), Breo, Pian della Valle, Carassone, Altipiano, Borgato and Rinchiuso, lower, next to the Ellero stream, developed from the 18th century when industries developed in Mondovì and when it was reached by the railway.

The Funicolare di Mondovì, a funicular railway reopened in 2006, links Breo with Piazza.

It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mondovì.

==History==

Founded on a hilltop in 1198 by survivors of the destroyed village of Bredolo and by inhabitants of the neighboring villages of Vico (now Vicoforte), Vasco (now Monastero di Vasco) and Carassone (which was abandoned after the founding of the new city): an independent comune named &quot;Ël Mont ëd Vi&quot;, meaning &quot;The Mount of Vico&quot; in Piedmontese, was formed.

Their independence proved to be short-lived because the bishop of Asti and the marquis of Ceva stormed it in 1200 and destroyed it in 1231. The commune resisted, however, and the following year it was able to sustain another attack from Asti. In 1260 it was occupied by Charles I of Anjou (then King of Naples and one of the most powerful landlords in Provence and north-western Italy), while in 1274 it returned under the bishops of Asti. In 1290 he was however able to buy back its communal independence, under the new name of &quot;Mons Regalis&quot; (&quot;Royal Mount&quot;) due to its large privileges. In 1305 it fell again under the Angevins, followed by the Visconti, the Marquisate of Montferrat, the Acaja and, from 1418, the House of Savoy.

Mondovì continued to grow until the 16th century when it was the largest city in Piedmont. In 1537 it was occupied by France, under which it mostly remained until 1559. In 1560, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy restored it to Piedmont, which held it until the Italian unification, apart from the Napoleonic period (1796–1814).

Piedmont&#x27;s first printing press was created in Mondovì in 1472. From 1560 to 1566, Mondovì was the seat of Piedmont&#x27;s first university.

<doc id="1070449" wikidata="Q17012934" url="?curid=1070449" title="Oh, What a Lovely War!">
<text>Oh, What a Lovely War! is an epic musical developed by Joan Littlewood and her ensemble at the Theatre Workshop in 1963. It is a satire on World War I, and by extension on war in general. The title is derived from the &quot;somewhat satirical&quot; music hall song &quot;Oh! It&#x27;s a Lovely War!&quot;, which is one of the major numbers in the production.

==Development==
The idea for the production started on Armistice Day 1962 when Gerry Raffles heard the repeat of the second version of Charles Chilton&#x27;s radio musical for the BBC Home Service, called &quot;The Long Long Trail&quot; about World War I. Written and produced by Chilton in memory of his father whose name was inscribed on the memorial at Arras, the piece was a radio documentary that used facts and statistics, juxtaposed with reminiscences and versions of songs of the time, as an ironic critique of the reality of the war. The songs were found in a book published in 1917 called &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Tunes&quot; which had new lyrics written in the trenches to well-known songs of the era, many from hymns or from West End shows. Bud Flanagan provided the voice of the &quot;ordinary soldier&quot;. The title came from the popular music hall song &quot;There&#x27;s a Long Long Trail A-Winding&quot; published in 1913, mentioned in the introduction of &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Tunes&quot;. 
Raffles proposed the idea of using it as the basis of a production to his partner, Joan Littlewood, but she detested the idea, hating World War I, military uniforms, and everything they stood for. Gerry though, brought Chilton along to the theatre and they played through the songs. Eventually Littlewood considered it might work, but refused any military uniforms, deciding on pierrot costumes from Commedia dell&#x27;arte very early on as a &quot;soft, fluffy entertainment mode&quot; providing an ironic contrast to the tin hats which they also wore. Littlewood said, in 1995, that &quot;Nobody died on my stage, they died in the film – that they ruined&quot;. She wanted audiences to leave the theatre laughing at the &quot;vulgarity of war&quot;. The idea was to portray how groups of people could lose their sense of individuality by conforming to those of a higher authority, which Littlewood despised.

The Theatre Workshop developed productions through improvisation and initially the cast would learn the original script but then have that taken away and have to retell the story in their own words for performance. Each member of the Theatre Workshop was tasked with learning about a particular topic, such as Ypres or gas. As the production developed, it also used scenes from &quot;The Donkeys&quot; by military historian (and future Conservative politician) Alan Clark, initially without acknowledgement: Clark took Littlewood to court to get credited.

Some scenes in the production, notably one on the first time the trenches were gassed, were worked on for many days only for Littlewood to conclude they were too horrific for an audience, and delete them. This was another reason why uniforms were not worn in the production.

==Productions==
The musical premiered at the Theatre Royal Stratford East on 19 March 1963 to rave audience reaction. Kenneth Tynan&#x27;s review in &quot;The Observer&quot; was titled &quot;Littlewood returns in triumph&quot;.

The official censor did not grant permission for a transfer to the West End until Princess Margaret attended a performance and commented to the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Cobbold, that &quot;What you&#x27;ve said here tonight should have been said long ago, don&#x27;t you agree, Lord Cobbold?&quot;; at this point the transfer was more or less assured despite the objections of the family of Field Marshal Haig. It was an ensemble production featuring members of the theatre&#x27;s regular company, which included Brian Murphy, Victor Spinetti, Glynn Edwards and Larry Dann, all of whom played several roles. In 2023, Dann shared his memories of the production for his autobiography, &quot;Oh, What A Lovely Memoir&quot;. The sets were designed by John Bury. The production subsequently transferred to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in June of the same year. The production was a surprise hit, and the musical was adapted by the BBC for radio several times.

The musical premiered in the United States on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on 30 September 1964 and closed on 16 January 1965 after 125 performances. It was seen there by actor and former subaltern Basil Rathbone, who wrote to Charles Chilton that &quot;we were duped, it was a disgusting war&quot;. Directed by Littlewood, the cast featured Spinetti and Murphy, plus Barbara Windsor. It received four Tony Award nominations: for Best Musical, Best Direction, Best Featured Actress, and Best Featured Actor, winning Best Featured Actor. Spinetti also won the Theatre World Award.

From September 2023 until May 2024, a 60th Anniversary production by Blackeyed Theatre toured the UK.
==Description==
The original production was performed with the cast in pierrot costumes and metal helmets due to Littlewood&#x27;s abhorrence of the colour khaki and anti-war feelings. Behind them projected slides (operated by projectionist Tom Carr) showed images from the war and a moving display (what Littlewood called her &quot;electronic newspaper&quot; from having seen one in East Berlin on a railway bridge) across the full stage width with statistics, such as &quot;Sept 25 . . . Loos . . . British loss 8,236 men in 3 hours . . . German loss nil&quot; and &quot;Average life of a machine gunner under attack on the Western Front: 4 minutes&quot;.

Separating the performers from the actual events in this way would stop the audience collapsing in tears, and the production features such World War I-era songs as &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;, &quot;Pack up Your Troubles&quot; and &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot;. Harsh images of war and shocking statistics are projected onto the backdrop, providing a contrast with the comedy of the action taking place before it. The audience were also invited to join in with singing the songs.

The first act was designed to draw the audience in with the sentimentality of the songs, and the first explosion does not take place until the end of Act 1 during &quot;Goodbye...ee&quot;. Act 2 then brings the horror of war to the production.

==Title song==
The song &quot;Oh! It&#x27;s a Lovely War&quot; was written by J. P. Long and Maurice Scott in 1917 and was part of the repertoire of music hall star and male impersonator Ella Shields. The lyrics of the first verse and the chorus are as follows:

==Adaptation and in culture==
Richard Attenborough&#x27;s film adaptation was released in 1969, also as a musical, and won numerous awards. It was Attenborough&#x27;s debut as a film director.

Several Australian World War I movies and miniseries (e.g. &quot;The Lighthorsemen&quot; and &quot;Gallipoli&quot;) have used these songs to give a stronger sense of period to them. The 1985 series &quot;Anzacs&quot; used &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s a lovely war&quot; as one of the numbers while the credits rolled, had &quot;I wore a tunic&quot; performed as part of an entertainment piece while the characters were on easy duties, used &quot;Keep the home fires burning&quot; as another credit number, and featured &quot;The Bells of Hell&quot; sung by Tony Bonner and Andrew Clarke.

<doc id="1070476" wikidata="Q2257348" url="?curid=1070476" title="Grammar checker">
<text>A grammar checker, in computing terms, is a program, or part of a program, that attempts to verify written text for grammatical correctness. Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.

The implementation of a grammar checker makes use of natural language processing.

==History==

The earliest &quot;grammar checkers&quot; were programs that checked for punctuation and style inconsistencies, rather than a complete range of possible grammatical errors. The first system was called Writer&#x27;s Workbench, and was a set of writing tools included with Unix systems as far back as the 1970s. The whole &quot;Writer&#x27;s Workbench&quot; package included several separate tools to check for various writing problems. The &quot;diction&quot; tool checked for wordy, trite, clichéd or misused phrases in a text. The tool would output a list of questionable phrases, and provide suggestions for improving the writing. The &quot;style&quot; tool analyzed the writing style of a given text. It performed a number of readability tests on the text and output the results, and gave some statistical information about the sentences of the text.

Aspen Software of Albuquerque, New Mexico released the earliest version of a diction and style checker for personal computers, &quot;Grammatik&quot;, in 1981. &quot;Grammatik&quot; was first available for a Radio Shack - TRS-80, and soon had versions for CP/M and the IBM PC. Reference Software International of San Francisco, California, acquired &quot;Grammatik&quot; in 1985. Development of &quot;Grammatik&quot; continued, and it became an actual grammar checker that could detect writing errors beyond simple style checking.

Other early diction and style checking programs included &quot;Punctuation &amp; Style&quot;, &quot;Correct Grammar&quot;, &quot;RightWriter&quot; and &quot;PowerEdit&quot;. While all the earliest programs started out as simple diction and style checkers, all eventually added various levels of language processing, and developed some level of true grammar checking capability.

Until 1992, grammar checkers were sold as add-on programs. There were a large number of different word processing programs available at that time, with WordPerfect and Microsoft Word the top two in market share. In 1992, Microsoft decided to add grammar checking as a feature of Word, and licensed CorrecText, a grammar checker from Houghton Mifflin that had not yet been marketed as a standalone product. WordPerfect answered Microsoft&#x27;s move by acquiring Reference Software, and the direct descendant of &quot;Grammatik&quot; is still included with WordPerfect.

As of 2019, grammar checkers are built into systems like Google Docs and Sapling.ai, browser extensions like Grammarly and Qordoba, desktop applications like Ginger, free and open-source software like LanguageTool, and text editor plugins like those available from WebSpellChecker Software.

==Technical issues==
The earliest writing style programs checked for wordy, , clichéd, or misused phrases in a text. This process was based on simple pattern matching. The heart of the program was a list of many hundreds or thousands of phrases that are considered poor writing by many experts. The list of questionable phrases included alternative wording for each phrase. The checking program would simply break text into sentences, check for any matches in the phrase dictionary, flag suspect phrases and show an alternative. These programs could also perform some mechanical checks. For example, they would typically flag doubled words, doubled punctuation, some capitalization errors, and other simple mechanical mistakes.

True grammar checking is more complex. While a programming language has a very specific syntax and grammar, this is not so for natural languages. One can write a somewhat complete formal grammar for a natural language, but there are usually so many exceptions in real usage that a formal grammar is of minimal help in writing a grammar checker. One of the most important parts of a natural language grammar checker is a dictionary of all the words in the language, along with the part of speech of each word. The fact that a natural word may be used as any one of several parts of speech (such as &quot;free&quot; being used as an adjective, adverb, noun, or verb) greatly increases the complexity of any grammar checker.

A grammar checker will find each sentence in a text, look up each word in the dictionary, and then attempt to parse the sentence into a form that matches a grammar. Using various rules, the program can then detect various errors, such as agreement in tense, number, word order, and so on. It is also possible to detect some stylistic problems with the text. For example, some popular style guides such as The Elements of Style deprecate excessive use of the passive voice. Grammar checkers may attempt to identify passive sentences and suggest an active-voice alternative.

The software elements required for grammar checking are closely related to some of the development issues that need to be addressed for speech recognition software. In voice recognition, parsing can be used to help predict which word is most likely intended, based on part of speech and position in the sentence. In grammar checking, the parsing is used to detect words that fail to follow accepted grammar usage.

Recently, research has focused on developing algorithms which can recognize grammar errors based on the context of the surrounding words.

==Criticism==
Grammar checkers are considered as a type of foreign language writing aid which non-native speakers can use to proofread their writings as such programs endeavor to identify syntactical errors. However, as with other computerized writing aids such as spell checkers, popular grammar checkers are often criticized when they fail to spot errors and incorrectly flag correct text as erroneous. The linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum argued in 2007 that they were generally so inaccurate as to do more harm than good: &quot;for the most part, accepting the advice of a computer grammar checker on your prose will make it much worse, sometimes hilariously incoherent.&quot;

<doc id="1070488" wikidata="Q2738344" url="?curid=1070488" title="Roy Wilkins">
<text>Roy Ottoway Wilkins (August 30, 1901 – September 8, 1981) was an American civil rights leader from the 1930s to the 1970s. Wilkins&#x27; most notable role was his leadership of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), in which he held the title of Executive Secretary from 1955 to 1963 and Executive Director from 1964 to 1977. Wilkins was a central figure in many notable marches of the civil rights movement and made contributions to African-American literature. He controversially advocated for African Americans to join the military.

==Early life==
Wilkins was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 30, 1901. His father was not present for his birth, having fled the town in fear of being lynched after he refused demands to step away and yield the sidewalk to a white man. When he was four years old, his mother died from tuberculosis, and Wilkins and his siblings were then raised by an aunt and uncle in the Rondo neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota, where they attended local schools. Wilkins graduated from Mechanic Arts High School. His nephew was Roger Wilkins. Wilkins graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in sociology in 1923.

In 1929, he married social worker Aminda &quot;Minnie&quot; Badeau; the couple had no children of their own, but they raised the two children of Hazel Wilkins-Colton, a writer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

== Early career ==

While attending college, Wilkins worked as a journalist at &quot;The Minnesota Daily&quot; and became editor of &quot;The Appeal&quot;, an African-American newspaper. After he graduated he became the editor of &quot;The Call&quot; in 1923.

His confrontation of the Jim Crow laws led to his activist work, and in 1931 he moved to New York City as assistant NAACP secretary under Walter Francis White. When W. E. B. Du Bois left the organization in 1934, Wilkins replaced him as editor of &quot;The Crisis&quot;, the official magazine of the NAACP. From 1949 to 1950, Wilkins chaired the National Emergency Civil Rights Mobilization, which comprised more than 100 local and national groups.

He served as an adviser to the War Department during World War II.

In 1950, Wilkins—along with A. Philip Randolph, founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and Arnold Aronson, a leader of the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council—founded the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR). LCCR has become the premier civil rights coalition, and has coordinated the national legislative campaign on behalf of every major civil rights law since 1957.

== NAACP leadership ==
In 1955, Wilkins was chosen to be the executive secretary of the NAACP and in 1964, he became its executive director. He had developed an excellent reputation as a spokesperson for the Civil Rights Movement. One of his first actions was to provide support to civil rights activists in Mississippi who were being subjected to a &quot;credit squeeze&quot; by members of the White Citizens Councils.

Wilkins backed a proposal suggested by T. R. M. Howard of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, who headed the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, a leading civil rights organization in the state. Under the plan, black businesses and voluntary associations shifted their accounts to the black-owned Tri-State Bank of Memphis, Tennessee. By the end of 1955, about $300,000 had been deposited in Tri-State for that purpose. The money enabled Tri-State to extend loans to credit-worthy blacks who were denied loans by white banks. Wilkins participated in the March on Washington (August 1963), which he had helped organize. The march was dedicated to the idea of protesting through acts of nonviolence in which Wilkins was a firm believer. Wilkins also participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) and the March Against Fear (1966).

He believed in achieving reform by legislative means, testified before many Congressional hearings, and conferred with Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter. Those achievements gained Wilkins attention from government officials and other established politicians, earning him respect as well as the nickname, &quot;Mr. Civil Rights&quot;. Wilkins strongly opposed militancy in the movement for civil rights as represented by the &quot;black power&quot; movement because of his support for nonviolence. He was a strong critic of racism in any form regardless of its creed, color, or political motivation, and he also declared that violence and racial separation of blacks and whites were not the answer. As late as 1962, Wilkins criticized the direct action methods of the Freedom Riders, but changed his stance after the Birmingham campaign, and was arrested for leading a picketing protest in 1963.

On issues of segregation, as well, he was a proponent of systematic integration instead of radical desegregation. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot;, Wilkins declared,

However, his moderate views increasingly brought him into conflict with younger, more militant black activists who saw him as an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;.

Wilkins was also a member of Omega Psi Phi, a fraternity with a civil rights focus and one of the intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternities established for African Americans.

In 1964, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP.

During his tenure, the NAACP played a pivotal role in leading the nation into the Civil Rights Movement and spearheaded the efforts that led to significant civil rights victories, including Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

In 1968, Wilkins also served as chair of the U.S. delegation to the International Conference on Human Rights. After turning 70 in 1971, he faced increased calls to step down as NAACP chief.

In 1977, at the age of 76, Wilkins finally retired from the NAACP and was succeeded by Benjamin Hooks. Wilkins was honored with the title Director Emeritus of the NAACP in the same year. He died on September 8, 1981, in New York City, from heart problems related to a pacemaker implanted on him in 1979 because of his irregular heartbeat. In 1982, his autobiography, &quot;Standing Fast: The Autobiography of Roy Wilkins&quot;, was published posthumously.

== Views ==
Wilkins was a staunch liberal and proponent of American values during the Cold War. He denounced suspected and actual communists within the Civil Rights Movement. He had been criticized by some on the left of the movement, such as Daisy Bates, Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Robert F. Williams, and Fred Shuttlesworth, for his cautious approach, suspicion of grassroots organizations, and conciliatory attitude towards white anticommunism.

In 1951, J. Edgar Hoover and the US State Department, in collusion with the NAACP and Wilkins, who was then the editor of &quot;The Crisis&quot;, the official magazine of the NAACP, arranged for a ghost-written leaflet to be printed and distributed in Africa. The purpose of the leaflet was to spread negative press and views about the black political radical and entertainer Paul Robeson throughout Africa. Roger P. Ross, a State Department public affairs officer working in Africa, issued three pages of detailed guidelines including the following instructions:

United States Information and Educational Exchange (USIE) in the Gold Coast, and I suspect everywhere else in Africa, badly needs a through-going, sympathetic and regretful but straight talking treatment of the whole Robeson episode... there&#x27;s no way the Communists score on us more easily and more effectively out here, than on the US. Negro problem in general, and on the Robeson case in particular. And, answering the latter, we go a long way toward answering the former.

The finished article published by the NAACP was called &quot;Paul Robeson: Lost Shepherd&quot;, and penned under the false name of &quot;Robert Alan&quot;, who the NAACP claimed was a &quot;well known New York journalist&quot;. Another article by Roy Wilkins, &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Greatest Defeat&quot;, denounced Robeson and the Communist Party USA in terms consistent with the FBI&#x27;s information.

At the time of Robeson&#x27;s widely misquoted declaration at the Paris Peace Conference that blacks would not support the United States in a war against the Soviet Union because of the continued lynchings and their legal second-class citizen status after World War II, Wilkins stated that regardless of the number of lynchings that then occurred or would occur, black Americans would always serve in the armed forces.

Wilkins also threatened to cancel a charter of an NAACP youth group in 1952 if it did not cancel its planned Robeson concert.

===Support for military===
Wilkins&#x27; views towards the participation of black military members in the US military was a point of contention between him and other prominent civil rights leaders. While most civil rights groups and activists stayed quiet or spoke out against the Vietnam War, Wilkins spoke about what he believed African-Americans could gain from serving in the military. An article posted in the Western Journal of Black Studies suggests that black troops were fighting for equality both in the United States as well as overseas. Wilkins emphasized the financial benefits of serving in the military along with the importance of African-American citizens participating in the first integrated American army.

Wilkins&#x27;s efforts to further equality in the realm of international affairs were publicly recognized in 1969, when he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Lyndon Johnson.

==Death and legacy==
Wilkins died on September 8, 1981, in New York City, at the age of 80. During his later life Wilkins was frequently referred to as the &quot;Senior Statesman&quot; of the Civil Rights Movement.

In 1982, his autobiography &quot;Standing Fast: The Autobiography of Roy Wilkins&quot; was published posthumously.

The Roy Wilkins Renown Service Award was established in 1980 to recognize members of the Armed Forces who embodied the spirit of equality and human rights. The St. Paul Auditorium was renamed for Wilkins in 1985. The Roy Wilkins Center for Human Relations and Social Justice was established at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs in 1992. Roy Wilkins Park in St. Albans, Queens, New York was named after him as a unique public and cultural touchstone for all of New York City.

Gil Scott-Heron mentioned Wilkins in his spoken word song &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; with this lyric: &quot;There will be no slow motion or still life of Roy Wilkins strolling through Watts in a red, black and green liberation jumpsuit that he has been saving for just the proper occasion.&quot; Amiri Baraka stated, in his &quot;Civil Rights Poem&quot;, that &quot;if i ever see roywilkins [sic.] on the sidewalks imonna [sic.] stick half my sandal up his ass&quot;. In 2001, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 34 cent stamp honoring Wilkins. In 2002, Molefi Kete Asante listed Roy Wilkins on his list of the 100 Greatest African Americans.

He is played by Joe Morton in the 2016 television drama &quot;All the Way&quot;. 

Chris Rock portrayed Wilkins somewhat unfavorably in the 2023 Netflix film &quot;Rustin&quot;. In the film&#x27;s final scenes, Wilkins comes around to a more positive view of Bayard Rustin, who is portrayed throughout the film as a Wilkins nemesis during the planning of the March on Washington.

<text>Adansonia gregorii, commonly known as the boab and also known by a number of other names, is a tree in the family Malvaceae, endemic to the northern regions of Western Australia and the Northern Territory of Australia.

==Names==

The specific name &quot;gregorii&quot; honours the Australian explorer Augustus Gregory.

The most widely recognised common name is &#x27;boab&#x27;, which is a shortened form of the generic common name &#x27;boabab&#x27;. It does, however, have many other common names, including:
* baobab — the common name for the genus as a whole, but often used in Australia to refer to the Australian species
* Australian baobab
* boabab was in common use from the late 1850s (Perhaps the origin of boab)
* baob

&quot;Gadawon&quot; is one of the names used by the local Aboriginal Australian groups. Other names include &quot;larrgadi&quot; or &quot;larrgadiy&quot;, which is widespread in the Nyulnyulan languages of the Western Kimberley.

Other names include:
* bottle tree or bottletree
* cream of tartar tree
* gourd-gourd tree
* gouty stem tree
* monkey bread tree
* sour gourd
* upside down tree
* dead rat tree

==Habitat==
Endemic to Australia, boab occurs in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and east into the Northern Territory. It is the only baobab to occur in Australia, the others being native to Madagascar and mainland Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There are various theories as to how the tree got to Australia, with &quot;A. gregorii&quot; and &quot;A. digitata&quot;, its African relative, being very similar genetically.

It can grow from sea level to about in altitude, and is most often found in open forest and rocky areas, but is also seen in monsoon forest.

==Description==

As with other baobabs, &quot;Adansonia gregorii&quot; is easily recognised by the swollen base of its trunk, which forms a massive caudex, giving the tree a bottle-like appearance. 
Boab ranges from in height, usually , with a broad bottle-shaped trunk, up to in diameter.

&quot;A. gregorii&quot; is deciduous, losing its leaves during the dry winter period and producing new leaves and large white flowers between December and May, up to long. The flowers open at night, and have a calyx about long. The inner surface is densely sericeous.

Boabs are pollinated by the convolvulus hawk-moth &quot;Agrius convolvuli&quot;.

The tree&#x27;s bark has a remarkable property, in that it can maintain inscribed markings for long periods of time, over more than a century. Some specimens of the African relative of boabs have been estimated to live close to 2,000 years, but the Australian ones are not as well-documented.

==Uses==

The plant has a wide variety of uses; most parts are edible and it is the source of a number of materials. Its medicinal products and the ability to store water through dry seasons has been exploited. Aboriginal Australians obtained water from the tree, owing to its ability to store huge amounts of water; some of the oldest and largest trees can hold more than of water in their trunks. They also use the white powder that fills the seed pods (or pith, said to taste like sherbet or cream of tartar) as a food.

Decorative paintings or carvings were sometimes made on the outer surface of the fruit.

The bark and leaves are used medicinally, in particular for digestive ailments.

The root fibres are used to create string.

The 1889 book &quot;Useful Native Plants of Australia&quot; states that &quot;The dry acidulous pulp of the fruit is eaten. It has an agreeable taste, like cream of tartar&quot;.

European use of the trees has included letter boxes and jails.

The leaves may see a future use prepared as food, due to their high iron content. The leaves can be boiled and eaten as a spinach; the seeds can be ground and used as a coffee-like beverage, and fermenting the pulp creates a type of beer.

==Notable trees==

A large hollow boab south of Derby, Western Australia is reputed to have been used in the 1890s as a lockup for Aboriginal prisoners on their way to Derby for sentencing. The Boab Prison Tree, Derby is now a tourist attraction.

Another hollow boab near Wyndham, Western Australia was also used as a prison tree. The Hillgrove Lockup or Wyndham Prison Tree is on the King River Road out of Wyndham near the Moochalabra Dam. There is also a boab tree located within the Wyndham Caravan Park that is billed as &quot;the biggest boab in captivity&quot;.

Gija Jumulu is a large boab which was transported from Warmun in the Kimberley region to Kings Park in the Western Australian capital city, Perth in 2008. the tree was growing well, after an initial period showing signs of stress after the move, demonstrating the adaptability of the species in a different climate.

Gregory&#x27;s Tree, in the Gregory&#x27;s Tree Historical Reserve at Timber Creek, NT, is an Aboriginal sacred site and a registered Australian heritage site. The boab tree marks the site of a camp of the explorer Augustus Charles Gregory, and is inscribed with the dates of his party&#x27;s arrival and departure, from October 1855 to July 1856.

==Dendroglyphs==
In 2021, a collaborative project to find and trace histories etched in boab trees in the Kimberley was launched. Funded by the Australian Research Council, archaeologists from the Australian National University (ANU), the University of Western Australia, the University of Canberra, and University of Notre Dame Australia are working with Aboriginal communities and using advanced technology (photogrammetry) to record 3D images of carvings on the trees. It is &quot;the first systematic survey and recording program of carved boab trees in Australia&quot;.

In October 2022, the team published the results of their recent survey of such trees in the Tanami Desert. The survey records the tree markings, also known as dendroglyphs, relating to the Lingka Dreaming track across the desert. Also known as the King Brown Snake dreaming, many of the carvings are of snakes, but also include emu and kangaroo tracks; geometric markings; and, further west, crocodiles, turtles and Wanjina figures. The researchers also found stone artefacts and broken grinding stones, used for grinding seeds, as camps were often made underneath the large shady trees.

==In film==
A boab tree is featured in the 1992 animated film &quot;&quot; to imprison the film&#x27;s antagonist, Hexxus.

The boab tree is celebrated in the end credits of the 2008 film &quot;Australia&quot; with the song &quot;By the Boab Tree&quot;, a song nominated for a 2008 Satellite Award, with lyrics by Baz Luhrmann and performed by Sydney singer Angela Little.

<doc id="1070494" wikidata="Q670335" url="?curid=1070494" title="The Young Gods">
<text>The Young Gods are a Swiss industrial rock band from Fribourg, formed in 1985. The original lineup of the band featured singer Franz Treichler, sampler player Cesare Pizzi and drummer Frank Bagnoud. For most of their history, the band maintained a trio format with a singer, a sampler player and a drummer, albeit with multiple line-up changes. Treichler is the band&#x27;s sole consistent member; the current line-up also features Pizzi and drummer Bernard Trontin. During their career, the band have extensively collaborated with producer Roli Mosimann.

The band&#x27;s music is largely based on sampling and sound manipulation; the tracks are constructed from various samples, such as distorted guitar riffs and string sections. Their later releases have incorporated elements from ambient and electronic music. Their sample-based approach to rock music influenced numerous musicians such as David Bowie, The Edge and Mike Patton.

==History==
=== Formation, &quot;The Young Gods&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;eau rouge&quot; (1985–1991)===
Circa 1984, Fribourg-native guitarist Franz Treichler relocated to Geneva and started experimenting with sound collages on his 4-track recorder, following the dissolution of his punk band Jof &amp; The Ram, previously known as Johnny Furgler &amp; the Raclette Machine. Inspired by the sampling synthesizer E-mu Emulator, he started composing songs from these sound collages in early 1985 and introduced his roommate, former the Raclette Machine bassist Cesare Pizzi, to the sampler. The band started rehearsing with the addition of drummer Frank Bagnoud, who previously played in the same band as Pizzi.

The band took their name from the track &quot;Young God&quot; from Swans&#x27;s 1984 EP of the same name; Treichler was exposed to the track after booking the band for a performance in Switzerland in 1984. The band made their live debut in the late 1985. Their early performances were mostly guerrilla gigs, in which the band played at squats, factories and occupied public places illegally. In these very early performances, Pizzi operated the samples through tape-playing keyboards and a loop pedal; the samples were stored in cassettes and taped through an answering machine. While they were able to obtain an Akai sampler after 10 performances, their debut single &quot;Envoyé&quot; was produced with this setup. The band signed to Belgian Play It Again Sam record label after the release of &quot;Envoyé&quot; on Organik and Wax Trax! Records in 1986. A music video for the track was also produced. The single cover art featured the band&#x27;s logo carved onto Treichler&#x27;s chest; in 2005, he stated that the scar &quot;disappeared after five or six years&quot;. For their debut album, the band started working with former Swans member Roli Mosimann, who went on to become a long-time studio collaborator. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut was released in 1987 to critical acclaim in the United Kingdom: the record was named as the best album of 1987 by music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. &quot;Did You Miss Me?&quot;, a Gary Glitter cover from the album, was released as an accompanying single. During this period, the band regularly relocated to London.

Bagnoud left the band in 1987. Drummer Urs Hiestand then joined the band and the band began working on the follow-up album with Mosimann. The drumming duties were first offered to Bernard Trontin, a friend of Treichler and band&#x27;s then-future drummer; he refused due to his conflicting touring schedule. &quot;L&#x27;eau rouge&quot; was released in 1989 on Play It Again Sam, with non-album track &quot;L&#x27;Amourir&quot; and &quot;Longue route&quot; as singles. Like its predecessor, the record ranked among the year&#x27;s best on &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Pizzi departed the band following the release of the album and was replaced by Alain Monod, who performed on the subsequent tour. The tour featured the band&#x27;s first performances in the United States. Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;September Song&quot; became a staple of the band&#x27;s live set; they subsequently performed covers of Weill&#x27;s compositions on Switzerland&#x27;s Festival du Bois de la Bâtie. The studio versions of the tracks were released as &quot;The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill&quot; in 1991.

===&quot;T.V. Sky&quot;, &quot;Only Heaven&quot; and &quot;Heaven Deconstruction&quot; (1992–1997)===

For the recording of the band&#x27;s fourth album with Mosimann, Treichler located to New York, where he subsequently lived for a couple of years; other members joined them for six months. The band&#x27;s first English-language album, &quot;T.V. Sky&quot;, was released in 1992, with the single &quot;Skinflowers&quot; becoming an underground hit. North American leg of the accompanying tour was documented on the television documentary &quot;TV-Sky - The Young Gods US Tour 92&quot;. The band&#x27;s 1992 live performance in Australia was released as the live album &quot;Live Sky Tour&quot; in 1993.

Amidst the commercial success of acts such as Nine Inch Nails, the band signed to Interscope Records. As a part of the label&#x27;s request, the band worked with a sample clearance expert. The band&#x27;s ambient-influenced record, &quot;Only Heaven&quot;, was released in 1995. Music video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Kissing the Sun&quot;, was directed by Eric Zimmerman of H-Gun, who is known for his work on Nine Inch Nails&#x27;s &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; and Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;. To support &quot;Only Heaven&quot;, the band joined Ministry&#x27;s 1996 tour, touring extensively for two years. Hiestand, feeling that the touring lifestyle was tiring, left the band in 1996. Treichler and Monod, then living in New York, regarded his departure as a sign and relocated back to Switzerland. To fill in for drumming duties, Bernard Trontin joined the band in 1997.

A companion record to &quot;Only Heaven&quot;, titled &quot;Heaven Deconstruction&quot;, was independently released in 1996. The instrumental album featured fully-ambient compositions and soundscapes produced during &quot;Only Heaven&quot; recording sessions. Treichler originally anticipated &quot;Only Heaven&quot; to be a double album featuring those outtakes; nevertheless, Interscope vetoed the idea. Towards the end of the decade, the label dropped the band, citing low commercial performance. During this time, the band entered a lawsuit with their former label, Play It Again Sam, regarding their contract.

===&quot;Second Nature&quot;, &quot;Super Ready/Fragmenté&quot; and &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; (1998–2011)===

In 2000, the band released their electronic music-influenced seventh album, &quot;Second Nature&quot;. Citing the past problems with major labels such as Play It Again Sam, the band sought to release their album on their manager&#x27;s label, Intoxygene, which Treichler subsequently regretted. The track &quot;Lucidogen&quot; was also released as a single in that year. Following the release of the 2001 live album &quot;Live Noumatrouff, 1997&quot;, the band was commissioned to compose instrumentals for Swiss Federal Office of Public Health at Expo.02; these compositions were later reinterpreted and released under the name &quot;Music for Artificial Clouds&quot; in 2004. The record was later performed live as a part of which was a collaboration with anthropologist Jeremy Narby. In 2003, Ipecac Recordings issued &quot;Second Nature&quot; in North America.

Between 2003 and 2004, the band was left without a manager and a label. In 2005, the band started working on new material and released the compilation album &quot;XXY: 20 Years (1985-2005)&quot;, featuring career highlights and rarities. The album was released on Play It Again Sam with a new track, titled &quot;Secret&quot;, as a promotional single. In that year, the band played their anniversary shows in Montreux Jazz Festival and Willisau, Switzerland, followed by a European tour in November. The band&#x27;s performance in Montreux, which was a collaboration with Lausanne Sinfonietta and featured guest vocals from Mike Patton, was later released as a live album in 2010. The band&#x27;s former drummer, Frank Bagnoud, passed away after a long illness in June.

In 2006, the band issued &quot;Truce Diaries&quot;, which was recorded exclusively for the Swiss magazine &quot;Truce&quot;. The following year&#x27;s &quot;Super Ready/Fragmenté&quot; marked a return to a guitar-oriented sound in contrast to &quot;Second Nature&quot;. Around this time, multi-instrumentalist Vincent Hänni started collaborating with the band, eventually becoming a full member. In 2008, the band released &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, which featured acoustic interpretations of their past material. The band paid homage to the original Woodstock festival at their 2009 Paléo Festival gig, scoring the documentary &quot;Woodstock&quot; live with samples from the original artists. Hänni was involved in the recording of the band&#x27;s tenth studio album, 2010&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;; the band sought an improvisation-oriented direction with the addition of a fourth member. The record was succeeded by live albums, &quot;Super Ready/Fragmenté Tour – Live at Rote Fabrik, Zürich&quot; and &quot;Griots and Gods – Live at Eurockéennes Festival, Belfort&quot;; the latter featured the live collaboration between the band and experimental hip hop duo Dälek at Eurockéennes 2007.

===Pizzi&#x27;s return and &quot;Data Mirage Tangram&quot; (2012–present)===

Following the tour for &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, Monod and Hänni departed the band in 2012. Treichler approached the band&#x27;s former sampler player, Cesare Pizzi, who rejoined the band. The band toured in that year, performing tracks from the first two studio albums, &quot;The Young Gods&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;eau rouge&quot;, on which Pizzi had performed. The band also supplied original music for the animated short film, &quot;Kali the Little Vampire&quot;, which was released in that year.

In 2015, the band began working on new material. The album was inspired by their residency at Cully&#x27;s Off Festival. The band performed to small crowds and regularly improvised; Treichler has started playing guitar. The resulting record, &quot;Data Mirage Tangram&quot;, was released in 2019. Mixed by Alan Moulder, the album was nominated for IMPALA″s European Independent Album of the Year Award (2019). The band had approached Wax Trax! Records, which released their early work, for the record&#x27;s North American release, which was turned down by the label. On 17 July 2020, the band released the accompanying live album, &quot;Data Mirage Tangram: Live at La Maroquinerie, Paris 2019&quot; on Two Gentlemen.

In 2021, Treichler stated that the band has been working on a rendition of Terry Riley&#x27;s &quot;In C&quot;, which the band has been performing live. In June 2022, the band announced their new record, &quot;Play Terry Riley In C&quot;, to be released on October 21, 2022.

==Musical style and legacy==

The Young Gods&#x27;s sound has been described as industrial rock, industrial, avant-rock, post-industrial music and &quot;sampledelic rock&quot;; Treichler favours the term &quot;electronic rock music&quot;. 
Since their early career, the band have used sampling as a compositional and performance tool, constructing tracks electronically with treated electric guitar samples, musique concrète, classical vignettes and electronica. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; remarked that The Young Gods&#x27;s &quot;unusual vocals/sampler/drums configuration reconstructs rock from the ground up, producing a fiery collage of roaring guitars, blistering rhythms and Wagnerian orchestras, all presided over by Franz Treichler&#x27;s leering, guttural voice&quot;. Treichler has regarded &quot;abstraction&quot; and &quot;element of surprise&quot; as important factors for using the sampler, since they rendered the listeners to &quot;the first time you&#x27;re listening to music because you don&#x27;t know what it is&quot;. He has cited 60s psychedelia, Einstürzende Neubauten, Kraftwerk, punk rock movement and post-punk acts such as Killing Joke and Wire as influences on The Young Gods. Kurt Weill, whose compositions were covered on 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill&quot;, is also an influence: Treichler has credited him as a model for the band&#x27;s &quot;experiments with music but still in a song format&quot;.

The band has infused various styles of music to their sound through sampling: 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Young Gods&quot; made use of classical and metal guitar samples: the band have described their sound on this record as &quot;new sonic architecture&quot;. Their second album, &quot;L″eau rouge&quot;, incorporated cabaret and chanson influences. 1995&#x27;s &quot;Only Heaven&quot; delved into ambient territories while &quot;being cherished equally by heavy metal, indie, techno and industrial&quot;; the ambient elements were explored on instrumental albums such as &quot;Heaven Deconstruction&quot;. Focusing on synthesized, found sounds and computer plug-ins on 2000&#x27;s &quot;Second Nature&quot;, The Young Gods also occasionally strayed away from their sampler-based formula: multi-instrumentalist Vincent Hänni was employed for the recording of &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; and the acoustic record &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;. Treichler also played the guitar on those albums and &quot;Data Mirage Tangram&quot;.

Treichler&#x27;s lyrics are mostly sung in French and English. &quot;The Young Gods&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;eau rouge&quot; largely featured French vocals while 1992&#x27;s &quot;T.V. Sky&quot; became the band&#x27;s first English-language record. On the subsequent records Treichler mixed the two languages; in 2005, he stated: &quot;I hope to find a solution in between. But they&#x27;re very different to sing; they both have their rules.&quot; Lyricwise, Treichler often uses double entendres: the track &quot;L&#x27;Amourir&quot; from &quot;L&#x27;eau rouge&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;an intense love song or the end of a love affair&quot;. The title track from &quot;L&#x27;eau rouge&quot; is regarded as &quot;a celebration of &#x27;red water&#x27;&quot; and is a reference to menstruation. The track &quot;Lucidogen&quot; from &quot;Second Nature&quot; illustrates &quot;a fictitious drug which would make people more clairvoyant&quot; and was inspired by an anti-World Trade Organization riot that Treichler witnessed in Geneva in 1998. On &quot;The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, authors Simon Reynolds and Joy Press argued: &quot;Treichler&#x27;s lyrics brought out all the militaristic, fascistic tendencies inherent in Romanticism, Nietzsche et al., only to transcend and transfigure them&quot;; in a 1995 interview, Treichler dismissed Reynolds&#x27;s and Press&#x27;s Nietzschean interpretation of his lyrics.
David Bowie has cited the band as an influence when he was asked in 1995 if his record &quot;Outside&quot; was influenced by Nine Inch Nails, stating: &quot;The band that I was actually quite taken with was three guys from Switzerland called the Young Gods... I&#x27;d been aware of them previous to knowing about Nine Inch Nails.&quot; Bowie further praised the band&#x27;s approach in sampling and looping guitar riffs, which he tried to employ in his record. U2 guitarist The Edge namedropped the band as an influence on his soundtrack work for 1990 musical adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. Devin Townsend reported &quot;Only Heaven&quot; and &quot;Second Nature&quot; to be among his favourite albums. Other artists influenced by The Young Gods include Disco Inferno guitarist Ian Crause, Sepultura, Napalm Death, Mike Patton, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, The Chemical Brothers, Kill the Thrill and Laika.

<doc id="1070500" wikidata="Q531417" url="?curid=1070500" title="For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge">
<text>For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (often abbreviated as F.U.C.K.) is the ninth studio album by American rock band Van Halen. It was released on June 17, 1991, on Warner Bros. Records and is the third to feature vocalist Sammy Hagar. It debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and maintained the position for three consecutive weeks. The album marked a record in the band&#x27;s history, seeing seven of its eleven tracks released as singles.

The album marked the first time the band had Ted Templeman working in a producer capacity since &quot;1984&quot;, when David Lee Roth was still lead singer. He had, however, assisted in determining the track sequencing for the 1986 effort &quot;5150&quot;.

The album was remastered by Donn Landee and released on October 6, 2023, as part of &quot;The Collection II&quot;; the four studio albums with Hagar, plus an extra disc of eight rarities from this era.

A 2 LP, 2 CD, Blu-ray Expanded Edition of the album was released on July 12, 2024. It included a previously unreleased instrumental version of &quot;The Dream Is Over&quot; as well as Guitar and Organ Versions of the single mix of &quot;Right Now.&quot; It also included unreleased concert footage from the band&#x27;s December 4, 1991, performance in Dallas, Texas captured during the “For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour&quot;.

== Title ==
The album&#x27;s title came from lead singer Sammy Hagar, who wanted to push the issue of censorship by naming Van Halen&#x27;s album with a vulgarity, stating, &quot;That&#x27;s when censorship was a big issue. I wanted to name the album just &quot;Fuck&quot;.&quot; Hagar eventually backed away from the outright vulgarity after he was told by his friend, former world lightweight boxing champion Ray &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Mancini, that the word &quot;fuck&quot; was an acronym for the phrase &quot;for unlawful carnal knowledge&quot; (though this is a false etymology). Their tour promoting the album was unofficially named F.U.C.K. &#x27;n&#x27; Live. Prior to recording, the term &quot;for unlawful carnal knowledge&quot; was used by the band Coven as a track on their album &quot;Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls&quot; in 1969.

== Recording ==
Van Halen started work on the album in March 1990 and finished in April 1991, two months before its release. The album itself was marketed as the &quot;return&quot; to Van Halen&#x27;s hard rock roots, with most songs being guitar driven, and the synth sounds being replaced by pianos. The band also reconciled with producer Ted Templeman, who produced earlier Van Halen albums to return to work on the album. According to Eddie Van Halen, this happened because Hagar did not want to work with Andy Johns and Templeman let him &quot;get away with everything.&quot; The year-long production led to the &#x27;labored&#x27; sound.

This was the first album that Eddie recorded without his trademark Marshall Super Lead serving as the primary amplifier. The Marshall was fading, so he went with his 1989 Soldano SLO-100 to record the album primarily, though the Marshall was used sparingly. A prototype for what would become the Peavey 5150 series of custom amplifiers was also used. Peavey&#x27;s release of the 5150 series coincided with the release of the album.

&quot;Poundcake&quot; featured the sound of a battery-operated Makita power drill, which Eddie held to the pickups of his guitar and revved, creating the intro.

The instrumental &quot;316&quot; is named for the March 16, 1991 birthday of Eddie&#x27;s son Wolfgang, who later went on to be Van Halen&#x27;s last bass player, although the song predates his birth (as part of it was used by Eddie at the beginning of his guitar solo on tour, as seen on &quot;Live Without a Net&quot;, and was originally written for &quot;5150&quot;). On Wolfgang&#x27;s 25th birthday on March 16, 2016, his mother Valerie Bertinelli posted a photo on her Facebook page of her and Eddie during her pregnancy with the caption &quot;Ed playing 316 on my growing tummy, before he knew he would call it 316&quot; Eddie can be seen in the photo playing an acoustic guitar on top of Valerie&#x27;s pregnant belly.

The song &quot;Top of the World&quot; features a riff that was first heard on a studio recording during the outro of the 1984-era hit &quot;Jump&quot;. However on bootleg and official (but unreleased) recordings of Van Halen concerts during the original David Lee Roth era, the riff can sometimes be heard being played at the end of &quot;Dance The Night Away&quot;, the most notable being at the end of 1983 Us Festival performance of the song. &quot;Top of the World&quot; was played directly after &quot;Jump&quot; on the For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour and appears immediately after it on both (a live album recorded on that tour) and the &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; compilation.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s John Milward rated the album two out of five stars, explaining that it &quot;is so stuffed with zigzagging guitars and blustery vocals that it almost forgets to rock. Eddie Van Halen, who probably has more guitars than teeth, upends such a tackle box of hooks that they only start to surface after repeated listenings. Tasteful simplicity, which is never really simple at all, would have proved a better course to follow.&quot; He concluded that the guitars &quot;are busier, the beats are heavier, and the fun is fleeting. Van Halen has chops to burn, but &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;, like its lumbering opening track and first single, &#x27;Poundcake&#x27;, is stale.&quot;

Gina Arnold of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a C and said, &quot;It would be nice to believe that the acronym formed by the title of Van Halen&#x27;s new, top-charting album was intended as a covert blow against censorship in America. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s far more likely that the punny name merely indicates VH&#x27;s love of the kind of bathroom talk that third graders think is funny. [...] &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; doesn&#x27;t contain even one mind-numbingly catchy melody. Only &#x27;Top of the World&#x27; and &#x27;The Dream Is Over&#x27; come close to working up a truly fist-thrusting chorus, and the gist of the latter—&#x27;dream another dream, this dream is over&#x27;—may well be advice that Van Halen and their fans ought to take to heart.&quot;

In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating.

A retrospective review by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine was mixed. He stated that the title &quot;indicates the true nature of &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; [...] Backing away from the diversity of &quot;OU812&quot;, the band turns in some of the most basic, straightforward rock &amp; roll of its career.&quot; However, he also stated that it was &quot;undeniable that [Sammy Hagar&#x27;s] limited vocal power had a great deal to do with the obvious nature of most of this music.&quot; He concluded that, even though the band continued to be tight and professional, the songwriting &quot;is, by and large, undistinguished, with the anthemic &#x27;Right Now&#x27; standing out as the most memorable song of the batch, mainly because of its incessant chorus.&quot;

<text>The Lishipa is a tribal group found in the Dirang area in the West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh in India.

==Origin==
They are ethnically related to both the Chugpa and Monpa, in which they are officially classified as a tribe of the Monpa.

However, the relative affinity of their linguistic origins to the Sherdukpen, Sulung and Bugun that rendered their distinct identity from the Monpas. The tribe boasts about 1,000 individuals.
