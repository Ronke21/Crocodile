<text>Ciołek (Polish for &quot;bull calf&quot;) is a Polish coat of arms, one of the oldest in medieval Poland. It was used by many &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) families under the late Piast dynasty, under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, during the Partitions of Poland, and in the 20th century. The variant names &quot;Siolek&quot; and &quot;Cialek&quot; arose from miscommunication among early-20th-century Polish immigrants to the United States.

==History==
A history of this coat-of-arms is included in a &quot;Short History of Polish Arms&quot; written by Countess Ewa Theresa Korab-Karpinska in the late 1980s, which is currently lodged at the College of Arms in London. As heraldic heiress and only daughter of Tadeusz Josef Żeleński (also spelled Zielinski/Zelinski), Ewa was one of a handful of women to write upon the subject of heraldry. The bull and crown were later exceptionally incorporated as a crest into an English Grant of Arms by the English College of Arms.

<doc id="1065113" wikidata="Q2435266" url="?curid=1065113" title="Tim McCarthy">
<text>Timothy J. McCarthy (born June 20, 1949) is an American retired police officer and special agent of the U.S. Secret Service. He is best known for defending then-president Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt on Reagan&#x27;s life on March 30, 1981, in Washington, D.C.

During the assassination attempt, McCarthy spread his stance to protect Reagan as six bullets were being fired by the would-be assassin, John Hinckley Jr. McCarthy stepped in front of President Reagan, taking a bullet to the chest, but made a full recovery. 

After the assassination attempt, McCarthy was hailed as a hero and received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982.

==Early life==
McCarthy was born on June 20, 1949, and was raised in Chicago&#x27;s Ashburn neighborhood. He graduated from St. Denis Grammar School and Leo Catholic High School. He then attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

He joined the Fighting Illini football team as a walk on in his freshman year. He earned a football scholarship for his sophomore year and played as strong safety his junior year before an injury ended his college career. 

While there, he was a member of Delta Tau Delta. He served 22 years in the United States Secret Service.

==Law enforcement career==
His career included eight years assigned to the Presidential Protective Division in Washington, D.C., and 14 years as a criminal investigator in Chicago. McCarthy was the special agent in charge of the Secret Service Chicago Division from 1989 until his retirement in October 1993.

== Reagan assassination attempt ==

On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr. opened fire on President Ronald Reagan as he exited the Washington Hilton Hotel after giving a speech, firing six bullets in 1.7 seconds. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, McCarthy put himself in the line of fire and spread his body in front of Reagan to make himself a target. He was struck in the chest by the fourth bullet, the bullet traversing McCarthy&#x27;s right lung, diaphragm, and right lobe of the liver. McCarthy was not wearing a bulletproof vest.

McCarthy was not supposed to be on duty that day. At the last minute, the Secret Service received a request for an officer to provide protection to Reagan for an AFL-CIO luncheon on March 31. McCarthy and a colleague flipped a coin to see who would have to fill in on their day off; McCarthy lost.

McCarthy was taken to George Washington University Hospital, and was operated on near the president. He was later released after a 2-hour surgery.

== Post-Secret Service career ==
McCarthy became the Chief of the Orland Park Police Department in May 1994. 

In 1998, he ran for the Democratic nomination for Illinois Secretary of State against Jesse White of Chicago, then the Recorder of Deeds for Cook County, and State Senator Penny Severns of Decatur. Severns was removed from the ballot after failing to meet the signature requirement. McCarthy ran an outsider campaign that took a law-enforcement approach to the Secretary of State&#x27;s office including standardized DUI tests and easier to read license plates. White won the primary election with 55% of the vote to McCarthy&#x27;s 45% of the vote, or a margin of 100,195 votes.

He earned a Bachelor of Science in Finance from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a Master of Science in Criminal/Social Justice from Lewis University.

In March 2016, he was awarded the first annual Chief of Police of the Year award by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police. The award cited his legislative advocacy, supervision of the building of the country&#x27;s first police station to receive a LEED Gold certification, working to establish the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force, promoting crisis intervention training for officers and the use of Narcan to prevent heroin overdoses. From July 2016 to April 2017 he served as the acting village manager of Orland Park. He later served as the corporate vice president of a security systems company, and appeared in speaking engagements at schools and conventions, where he related his experiences as a Secret Service Agent during the Reagan administration.

On July 1, 2020, McCarthy announced his retirement effective August 1, 2020.

== Personal life ==
McCarthy and his wife were married for 47 years at the time of his retirement in July 2020. They have three children.

McCarthy was interviewed in 2016 about the release of John Hinckley Jr., stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t have to agree with it, but I expected it. There are very few cases that people, after a period of time, are viewed as no longer being a danger to themselves or others. I hope they&#x27;re right about it. It&#x27;s a big decision. I give the judge credit. That&#x27;s what he gets paid for.&quot;

<text>The Auxiliary Corps of the Black Shirts&#x27; Action Squads (), most widely known as the Black Brigades (), was one of the Fascist paramilitary groups, organized and run by the Republican Fascist Party (&quot;Partito Fascista Repubblicano&quot;, PFR) operating in the Italian Social Republic (in northern Italy), during the final years of World War II, and after the signing of the Italian Armistice in 1943. They were officially led by Alessandro Pavolini, former Minister of Culture of the fascist era during the last years of Fascist Italy.

==History==

===Background===
On 25 July 1943 Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, was arrested after the Italian Grand Council of Fascism (&quot;Gran Consiglio del Fascismo&quot;), with the support of King Vittorio Emanuele III, overthrew him and began negotiations with the Allies for Italy&#x27;s withdrawal from the war. The Italian government was taken over by Marshal Pietro Badoglio, who outlawed the National Fascist Party (&quot;Partito Nazionale Fascista&quot;, PNF) and confiscated all of its assets.

On 12 September Mussolini was rescued in the Gran Sasso raid by German Luftwaffe Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) led by General Kurt Student and the Waffen-SS &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (Lieutenant Colonel), Otto Skorzeny. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer German-occupied northern Italy.

As the &quot;Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale&quot; (MVSN, also known as &quot;Blackshirts&quot;, &quot;Camicie Nere&quot;) had been disbanded in August by the terms of the armistice, the &quot;Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; was formed on 24 November 1943, and was to constitute the new fascist police force. The &quot;Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; was formed out of local police, ex-army, ex-Blackshirts and others still loyal to the fascist cause.

Anti-fascist political forces in Northern Italy, on their side, decided to oppose in arms the RSI and the German occupants, and began to recruit armed clandestine formations for guerrilla and urban warfare, with support from the Allies. Soon, a bloody civil war started in northern Italy.

===Constitution===
However, as soon as the fascist party in the RSI was reopened and reorganized as Republican Fascist Party (&quot;Partito Fascista Repubblicano&quot; - PFR), its members began to organize &quot;private&quot; armed units, to protect themselves and party officials from attacks by Italian resistance fighters, who actually started very soon to target RSI authorities and supporters. RSI manpower proved to be insufficient, and Italian authorities decided to organize all fascist party volunteer units in a dedicated structure, and to raise new forces.
The Black Brigades were formed by members of the Republican Fascist Party. Formation of the Black Brigades was sanctioned by a Fascist Republican Party decree issued personally by Benito Mussolini, head of PFR and of the RSI government, dated 30 June 1944, stating that all existing fascist armed units were to be enlisted into a military organization called &quot;Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d&#x27;Azione di Camicie Nere&quot;, and that every local Federation of the PFR (there was one in every Italian province) had to raise a military unit drafting personnel from its members. Units so formed were to be called &quot;Black Brigades&quot;, and were to be commanded by the local Federal Secretary of the PFR, with the rank of Major or Colonel.

Their duties were:
* to provide security for the members and assets of the PFR;
* to cooperate with German and Italian law enforcement authorities;
* to help military authorities in counter-insurgency operations.

This measure was to be both a response to resistance attacks against fascist members, and to turn the PFR into a fighting force to cope with shortage of manpower for internal security. Moreover, Mussolini and other fascist leaders felt that the Fascist Party was more true to its ideology if brought back to its original spirit when it was manned mainly by soldiers and veterans and was above all a fighting organization. In this optic, they decided to mobilize it for war duties, under the concept that every fascist was to be first of all a combatant, and had to take arms for the defence of Italy and fascism.
Black Brigades membership was compulsory for all members of the PFR deemed fit for such duties. Members were officially called &quot;Squadristi&quot; (Squad-men) (like the very first fascist Black Shirts of the 1920s), and were divided into three categories: &quot;Squadristi Permanenti&quot; (Full-time squad-men), &quot;Ausiliari di pronto impiego&quot; (Ready Response Auxiliaries), &quot;Ausiliari&quot; (Auxiliaries). Only full-time personnel were required to be on duty daily, while the other two categories were to be mobilized only in case of emergency. Black Brigade members were entitled to police powers, to carry firearms and to circulate freely even during curfew. Full-time personnel received a monthly wage of ITL 200.00.

===Operational service===
Police effectiveness of Black Brigades was feeble at best. Aside from particularly strong and well-equipped Brigades (such as VIIIth &quot;Aldo Resega&quot; of Milan, 2000 strong) that were exceptions, the average Black Brigades were at most 2-300 men strong, poorly equipped and armed, with little if any military training, and were hardly in conditions to defend themselves from partisan attacks, not to mention provide support to military authorities.

Many of their members were obscure figures evicted from the police or army, and conspicuous were also the hardline fascists who were pushed by resentment and revenge towards that part of the Italian population who, in their eyes, betrayed the Fascist regime. Many were also old &quot;Squadristi&quot; fascists who had served in the &#x27;20s, and who were eager to retake a first-place role in the ranks of the Fascist Party. In general terms, poor average discipline made all these individuals difficult to control, and prone to abuses.
As the military situation worsened, German mistrust towards the RSI military grew, and even Social Republic authorities looked at the Black Brigades with contempt. All these factors contributed to pushing the Black Brigades into political radicalization and increasingly hostile behaviour towards the population itself, among which they gained a fearsome reputation for fanatical brutality and summary procedures.
Apart from a few Black Brigades who had been found reliable enough to be committed in regular combat against partisans and Allies, most of these formations had poor military or even police capabilities and were mainly employed in static guard duties, patrols, and were often unleashed in brutal reprisals and retaliations against partisan attacks and ambushes to RSI military personnel. 

The Brigade members not only fought the Allies and the Italian partisans, but they also fought against political opponents and other Black Brigade members whose support of &quot;the cause&quot; was deemed less than exuberant. Many Black Brigade members were killed in this type of in-fighting.

After the armistice (April 25, 1945) and the end of the war in Italy, many members of the Black Brigades suffered harsh reprisals from partisan forces.

===War crimes===
The Black Brigades were frequently involved in support of German units during anti-partisan operations which resulted in massacres of the Italian civilian population, like at the Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema massacre in Tuscany where the 36th (?) helped the SS kill the entire village population of around 560 persons in August 1944. Or the Vinca massacre where 162 civilians were executed and where the 40. Brigata nera “Vittorio Ricciarelli” di Livorno was involved.

Members of Black Brigades were issued standard Italian army uniforms, and they tended to wear them with a black turtleneck sweater, or (in summer) the famous black shirt, as the symbol of loyalty to Mussolini and membership of the Republican Fascist Party. They sometimes wore this uniform with a windproof jacket in solid or camouflage colours. Members of Black Brigades tended to wear the grey-green uniform pants, but a wide array of uniforms were issued and, especially in the closing stages of the war, Black Brigades members used just anything they could obtain: army camouflaged one-piece suits, smocks and pants, paratroopers&#x27; collarless jump jackets (very popular), tropical Italian army uniforms, German pants and &quot;feldjacken&quot;, and frequently local produced uniforms and gear.



The badge or insignia of the Black Brigades was the jawless death&#x27;s head, with a dagger in its teeth, or one of assorted Italian versions. Collar tabs were issued, unique to the Black Brigades, consisting in square-shaped tabs with a pointed tip, of solid black cloth, on which was pinned a bright red republican fascio, in the lower part. In the upper part, every Brigade chose its own insignia: either one of the many variants of skulls (with or without crossbones) or coloured facing. Regulations prescribed for all members of the Black Brigades to wear a metal enamelled breast badge, of roundel shape, showing a golden fascio amidst Italian national colours in vertical stripes, and surrounded by a black enamel rim with the inscription: &quot;Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d&#x27;Azione di Camicie Nere&quot;, in capital letters, and in the lower part the identification number of the Brigade. Contemporary pictures show that this badge however, although certainly issued on a large scale, was not so often worn.

Many Black Brigades adopted sleeve badges, following Italian military tradition, both cloth and metal. These were usually of very fine workmanship, often minted and enamelled, and are today high-priced collector&#x27;s items. Rank insignias were the same as those prescribed for the Italian army; however, were rarely worn. Towards the end of the war, a specific rank system was introduced for the Black Brigades, unique to them, but it does not seem to have ever been implemented.

The majority of Black Brigade members wore Italian army ski caps or berets dyed black. Some photos show members also wearing black German-style caps. Some were Italian-made, some were supplied by Germany. Combat headgear was the ubiquitous M33 olive-green helmet, sometimes adorned with Black Brigades&#x27; skull insignia. German M35 helmets were also used as were M33 black MVSN helmets. Helmets were often sprayed with various camouflage patterns as was very common in that period. Combat gear and carrying equipment was the same as army soldiers. &quot;Samurai&quot; magazine vest, originally intended for elite army units, was widely used and so were a vast sorting of pouches, magazine-holders, holsters, both official issue (Italian or German) and privately made, carried on Italian M1908 olive-green leather carrying equipment.

==Organization==
The Black Brigades were not actually brigade-sized units. The Italian word &quot;brigata&quot; has a looser meaning as a synonym of &quot;group&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot;. Most Black Brigades were typically weak battalions or strong companies, each comprising 200 to 300 men; the size of a brigade however varied greatly depending on the city where it was based and where it recruited its men, with Black Brigades of major cities comprising thousands of men (the 8th Black Brigade &quot;Aldo Resega&quot; of Milan, for instance, had over 4,000 troops, and the 1st Black Brigade &quot;Ather Capelli&quot; of Turin had over 2,000). There were 41 territorial brigades. The territorial brigades were numbered 1 through 41. There were also seven &quot;independent&quot; and eight &quot;mobile&quot; brigades. The mobile brigades were numbered 1 through 7, plus the Second Arditi Brigade.

<text>Anthony Anderson (born August 15, 1970) is an American actor, comedian, and television host. He is known for his leading roles in television shows such as Andre &quot;Dre&quot; Johnson on the comedy series &quot;Black-ish&quot; (2014–2022), Marlin Boulet on the drama series &quot;K-Ville&quot; (2007), and NYPD Detective Kevin Bernard on the NBC crime drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (2008–2010, 2022). He has also had major roles in feature films such as &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; (2000), &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; (2003), &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot; (2004), &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; (2005), &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006), &quot;Transformers&quot; (2007), and &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011).

Anderson is currently the host of the Fox game show &quot;We Are Family&quot;. He has appeared as a regular judge on Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; and had roles on other television programs such as &quot;All About the Andersons&quot;, &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, &quot;Guys with Kids&quot;, and &quot;The Shield&quot;. From 2016 to 2022, Anderson served as host of the ABC version of the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and was a guest panelist on various game shows. In 2024, he hosted the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Compton, California. His mother, Doris Bowman (née Hancox), was a telephone operator and actress. His stepfather, Sterling Bowman, was a native of Little Rock, Arkansas, who moved to Los Angeles to work in the steel mill industry before opening a chain of three clothing stores. Sterling died in 2022. Anderson has a younger half-brother, Derrick Bowman, who works as an ICU nurse. Growing up, Anderson&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Tugga&quot; because he could not pronounce sugar. According to a DNA analysis, Anderson descends from the Bubi people of Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), and from the Tikar, Hausa, and Fulani people of Cameroon.

Anderson has stated that his first attempt at stand-up comedy was a failure. Although this experience was a blow to his ego, he met his future friend and fellow comedic actor Guy Torry there, who consoled him after the show and encouraged him to keep getting up on stage. He and Torry later acted together in the 1999 film &quot;Life&quot;, alongside Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence.

Anderson is an alumnus of the Hollywood High School Performing Arts Magnet&#x27;s Class of 1988. He initially enrolled at Howard University as a theater major but faced financial difficulties, leading him to leave after his junior year. Nearly three decades later, inspired by his son Nathan&#x27;s acceptance to the university, he returned to Howard to complete his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the Chadwick A. Boseman College of Fine Arts in 2022.

==Career==
=== 1995–2004: Early roles ===

Anderson&#x27;s early television work includes a lead role as Teddy Broadis in the teen series &quot;Hang Time&quot;, and many one-off guest appearances on shows such as &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;Malcolm &amp; Eddie&quot;, &quot;In the House&quot;, and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, as well as recurring roles on series like &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot; and &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;. Anderson has worked as an actor, often in comedic roles, since his film debut in &quot;Liberty Heights&quot; (1999). In 2002, he voiced the character Ray Ray in an episode of the Disney Channel animated series &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. He later reprised this role in a second-season episode of its revival series &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot;, which aired in 2023. From 2003 to 2004, he was the central character in the short-lived series &quot;All About the Andersons&quot;, which lasted for one season on The WB. He also had leading film roles in the comedy films &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; (2003), &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Daddy&quot; (2004), and &quot;King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (2005), with a supporting role in the family adventure film &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot; (2004).

=== 2005–2014: Rise to prominence ===
Anderson took supporting roles in the drama &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; (2005), and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s crime film &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006). Additionally, Anderson had a supporting role in &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; (2003) and &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; (2006). He was originally set to return in &quot;Scary Movie 5&quot; (2013) with Regina Hall and Kevin Hart. Anderson joined the cast of the long-running NBC crime drama television series, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 2008. After three seasons (18, 19, and 20) as Kevin Bernard, he reprised the role upon the series&#x27; revival in 2022, concurrent with the final episodes of &quot;Black-ish&quot;. In 2009, Anderson directed a one-minute short film featuring his &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; co-star Jeremy Sisto. The short was made for the Responsibility Project, a joint initiative of NBC and Liberty Mutual Group. The short aired during the &quot;In The House&quot; episode &quot;Reality Bites&quot; on October 16, 2009. In June 2010, he was cast in a minor role in &quot;Scream 4&quot;. 

Before his work in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Anderson starred in two other crime series, Fox&#x27;s &quot;K-Ville&quot; (as one of the lead characters) and FX&#x27;s &quot;The Shield&quot;. He also starred in the sitcom &quot;Guys with Kids&quot;, which lasted a single season. In 2013, Anderson signed on to host the celebrity-driven, family game show called &quot;Wall of Fame&quot;, which was produced by Endemol USA for NBC. Eight one-hour episodes were taped at the time, but never aired. Anderson&#x27;s series &quot;Eating America with Anthony Anderson&quot; was a summer show in 2014. He visited different towns in America that host &quot;food festivals&quot; highlighting a specific type of food. He was a frequent judge on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, and was one of the few judges to taste dishes from all the Iron Chefs on the show. In the &quot;Ultimate Bar Food&quot; battle, he served as bartender/sous-chef for Iron Chef Bobby Flay opposite Masaharu Morimoto and fellow judge Simon Majumdar.

=== 2014–2022: &quot;Black-ish&quot; ===

In 2014, Anderson began starring as Andre &quot;Dre&quot; Johnson on the ABC sitcom &quot;Black-ish&quot;, which completed its eight-season run in 2022. During its run Anderson received 11 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe Award nominations. In 2022, Anderson was not nominated as a producer or actor for its final season. He reacted to the news while guest hosting &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; joking, &quot;Can you believe that shit? Now I&#x27;m not saying the voters were stupid for not nominating me or &quot;Black-ish&quot; or Tracee, I&#x27;m just saying they&#x27;re racist.&quot; He also serves as executive producer on its spinoffs &quot;Grown-ish&quot;, which premiered on Freeform in 2018, and &quot;Mixed-ish&quot;, which ran on ABC for two seasons from 2019 to 2021. He guest starred as Dre in episodes on both series. From 2016 to 2022, he was the host of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, which also aired on ABC. In 2019, Anderson was a guest panelist in season two of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. He later competed in season ten as &quot;Rubber Ducky&quot; and was eliminated in the first episode when competing in Group A. In October 2022, Anderson and his mother Doris began filming &quot;Anthony Anderson and Mom: European Vacation&quot; to be aired on the E! network.

=== 2023–present: &quot;We Are Family&quot;===
In November 2023, it was announced that Anderson and his mother Doris would host the Fox game show &quot;We Are Family&quot;, replacing Jamie Foxx and his daughter, Corinne, who were originally set to host the show. It premiered on January 3, 2024. In December 2023, Anderson was named as the host of the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. The decision for Anderson to host was met with controversy due to his allegations of sexual assault. The Sexual Violence Prevention Association (SVPA) urged the Emmys and Fox, the network set to air the 2024 ceremony, to reconsider Anderson as host writing, &quot;The entertainment industry has the power and responsibility to protect individuals from sexual violence...the Emmys and Fox to not only remove Anderson as host, but to also conduct their due diligence going forward when selecting hosts.&quot; The telecast was met with mixed reviews and some criticism, in particular, regarding a recurring bit in which Anderson&#x27;s mother interrupted acceptance speeches that went on too long. Some on social media cited the moment when Anderson&#x27;s mother interrupted a speech given by Jennifer Coolidge, who won for &quot;The White Lotus&quot;, as being &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot;.

==Personal life==
Anderson was married to Alvina Stewart from September 1999 to September 2023. They have two children. Their son Nathan starred as Tahj in the Netflix sitcom &quot;Richie Rich&quot; and guest starred in &quot;Black-ish&quot;. Stewart initially filed for divorce in September 2015 citing irreconcilable differences, after having been separated since April 2014. They reconciled in January 2017 and she withdrew her petition. On March 25, 2022, she filed for divorce again, and it was granted by a judge the following year in September.

Anderson has type 2 diabetes and has been active in diabetes awareness.

Playing for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, in 2011, Anderson won $250,000 on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;.

Anderson is an honorary member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity; he was inducted on July 30, 2020. In 2019, a star was named after Anderson in the International Star Registry.

===Divorce settlement===
Nineteen months after their second split, Anderson and his ex-wife Alvina finalized their divorce in September 2023. The actor was ordered to pay more than $200,000 a year in spousal support per their divorce settlement, with a base amount of $20,000 monthly. The court documents stated that should the actor&#x27;s gross income exceed $2,000,000 per year, he was to pay 20% of the gross amount to her. Further settlement agreements stated that Anderson was to relinquish his Glock 19 firearm to law enforcement within 30 days of the divorce finalization. Anderson was set to keep their home in Encino and a 2004 Land Rover, while Alvina kept possession of their home in Houston and their 2022 Mazda. They also split their cemetery plots located in LA&#x27;s Inglewood Park Cemetery.

===Rape and sexual assault allegations===
Anderson was accused of raping a 25-year-old extra in a trailer on the film set of &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; on July 27, 2004. The alleged victim accused Anderson and assistant director Wayne Witherspoon of forcibly removing her clothing, photographing her naked body, and sexually assaulting her. A witness claimed to have heard the alleged victim&#x27;s screams and to have seen her run naked from the trailer, and she was treated at St. Francis Hospital. The charges were dropped on October 6, 2004, because the judge ruled that there was no probable cause to try the case.

Anderson was sued for sexual assault in September 2004 by another woman who claimed that Anderson made sexually suggestive remarks and then assaulted her in his dressing room on the set of &quot;All About the Andersons&quot;.
On July 20, 2018, it was revealed that he was being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department for another sexual assault allegation. Due to lack of evidence on September 4, the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s Office decided not to press charges against Anderson.

<text>Chute Forest is a village and civil parish in east Wiltshire, England. The parish is bordered to the east and south by the county of Hampshire. The village is about northwest of Andover and to the east of Ludgershall.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chute Forest&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, in the Latin phrase &quot;silva que vocatur Cetum&quot; (&quot;the wood that is called &quot;Cetum&quot;&quot;). The name derives from the Common Brittonic word that survives today in modern Welsh as (&quot;woodland&quot;). Spellings with an &quot;e&quot;, along the lines of &quot;Cet&quot;, &quot;Cette&quot;, &quot;Chet&quot; and &quot;Chette&quot; dominate the record through the thirteenth century and reflect the usual borrowing of this Brittonic word into Old English. The spelling &quot;Chute&quot;, first attested for the village that takes its name from the forest in 1268 (as &quot;Chuth’&quot;) and for the forest itself in 1283 (as &quot;Chute&quot;), reflects dialectal variation in Old English, specifically the West-Saxon sound-change known as palatal diphthongisation.

== History ==
The area was a large royal forest by the 13th century and continued in Crown ownership until 1639. It was then an extra-parochial area until it became a civil parish in the 19th century, and an ecclesiastical parish in 1875 after the church was built.

== The Chute Hoard ==
A hoard of Iron Age coins found in the northeast in 1927 (with further coins found in 1986 and 1994) is the only evidence of prehistoric activity in the parish. The coins are from the 1st century BC. The British Museum holds 36 coins while the Wiltshire Museum at Devizes has others, together with the hollow flint nodule in which they were found.

== Chute Lodge ==
Chute Lodge, in the centre of the parish, is a country house built in red brick in 1768 by Sir Robert Taylor, on or near the site of an earlier house. In 1988 the house was designated as Grade I listed.

==Parish church==

St Mary&#x27;s Church, 600 metres north of Chute Lodge, was built between 1870 and 1871 to designs by J.L. Pearson and consecrated in 1875. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building and is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

==Local government==
Chute Forest is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for almost all significant local government functions.

<doc id="1065124" wikidata="Q128017" url="?curid=1065124" title="In My Lifetime, Vol. 1">
<text>In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 is the second studio album by American rapper Jay-Z. It was released on November 4, 1997, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart and was certified Platinum by the RIAA, selling over 138,000 copies in its first week of release. &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot; also served as Jay-Z&#x27;s first album release following the sudden death of fellow Brooklyn rapper and collaborator The Notorious B.I.G. in March 1997.

== Production ==
The album features guest contributions by Lil&#x27; Kim, Foxy Brown, Babyface, Blackstreet, Teddy Riley, Too $hort, Sauce Money and Puff Daddy. Producers for &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; such as DJ Premier and Ski contribute to a limited number of beats on this album, though the majority of the production is handled by Puff Daddy&#x27;s production team The Hitmen from the Bad Boy label, giving the album a generally glossier sound than its predecessor. It displayed a shift from the mafioso rap themes of &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; to the so-called &quot;jiggy&quot; era of late 90s hip-hop, often credited to videos and albums from Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy record label&#x27;s roster of artists including The Notorious B.I.G. (the first two singles from his second album were both huge pop hits) and Mase. &quot;&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was like an introduction,&quot; Jay-Z told MTV News. &quot;Like, you know, meeting somebody out on the street... Everything, your whole conversation is very general, not too much detail and things like that. Its just that &#x27;In My Lifetime&#x27; is more detailed, more in-depth. Much more personal&quot;.

== Influence of the Notorious B.I.G. ==
In a 1998 interview with MTV News, Jay-Z explained how the death of fellow Brooklyn rapper and collaborator The Notorious B.I.G. shaped parts of &quot;In My Lifetime, Vol. 1&quot;. In the interview, he explained how the album was not as fun to record as his debut, (&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1996)), and that certain tracks, such as &quot;The City is Mine&quot;, were influenced by the rapper&#x27;s death.
== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review, Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; called &quot;In My Lifetime&quot; &quot;a rock-solid set with both street and pop appeal&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Soren Baker believed Jay-Z&#x27;s lyrics &quot;contain a finesse and insight few can articulate as succinctly&quot;, while writing that &quot;his use of pop producers Teddy Riley and Sean &#x27;Puffy&#x27; Combs will alienate listeners, even as Jay-Z establishes himself as that rare underground rhymer with commercial appeal&quot;. Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention in his 2000 &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; book, indicating a &quot;likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy&quot;. He named &quot;(Always Be My) Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Real Niggaz&quot; as highlights while calling Jay-Z &quot;arrogant yet diffident, ruthless yet cute—a scary original&quot;. Chris Norris of &quot;Spin&quot; said Jay-Z&#x27;s raps are often &quot;in search of meaty ideas or distinctive charm—skills without pleasure&quot;, and was also critical of the production. &quot;Without one sure, guiding vision,&quot; Norris wrote, &quot;the Combs blueprint comes off as either mundane or embarrassing&quot;.

AllMusic editor John Bush wrote in a retrospective review, &quot;Though the productions are just a bit flashier and more commercial than on his debut, Jay-Z remained the tough street rapper, and even improved a bit on his flow&quot;. According to Bush, he &quot;struts the line between project poet and up-and-coming player&quot; while balancing &quot;both personas with the best rapping heard in the rap game since the deaths of 2Pac and Notorious B.I.G.&quot;.

<doc id="1065128" wikidata="Q328413" url="?curid=1065128" title="David King (chemist)">
<text>Sir David Anthony King (born 12 August 1939) is a South African-born British chemist, academic, and head of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG).

King first taught at Imperial College, London, the University of East Anglia, and was then Brunner Professor of Physical Chemistry (1974–1988) at the University of Liverpool. He held the 1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge from 1988 to 2006, and was Master of Downing College, Cambridge, from 1995 to 2000: he is now emeritus professor. While at Cambridge, he was successively a fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Downing College, and Queens&#x27; College. Moving to the University of Oxford, he was Director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment from 2008 to 2012, and a Fellow of University College, Oxford, from 2009 to 2012. He was additionally President of Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin, Italy (2008–2011), and Chancellor of the University of Liverpool (2010–2013).

Outside of academia, King was Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government and Head of the Government Office for Science from 2000 to 2007. He was then senior scientific adviser to UBS, a Swiss investment bank and financial services company, from 2008 to 2013. From 2013 to 2017, he returned to working with the UK Government as Special Representative for Climate Change to the Foreign Secretary. He was also Chairman of the government&#x27;s Future Cities Catapult from 2013 to 2016.

==Early life and education==
King was born on 12 August 1939 in South Africa, son of Arnold Tom Wallis King, of Johannesburg, director of a paint company, and Patricia Mary Bede, née Vardy. His elder brother, Michael Wallis King (born 1937), was director of the FirstRand bank and vice-chair of the multinational mining company Anglo American plc. King was educated at St John&#x27;s College, an all-boys private school in Johannesburg. He studied at University of the Witwatersrand, graduating with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree and then a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1963.

==Academic career==
After his PhD, King moved to the United Kingdom where he was a Shell Scholar at Imperial College, London, from 1963 to 1966. He was then a lecturer in the School of Chemical Sciences of the University of East Anglia from 1966 to 1974. He was appointed Brunner Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Liverpool in 1974. He was a member of the National Executive of the Association of University Teachers from 1970 until 1978, and served as its president for the 1976/77 academic year.

In 1988, King was appointed 1920 Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. He subsequently served as Head of the University&#x27;s Department of Chemistry from 1993 to 2000, and was its director of research from 2005 to 2011. When he first moved to Cambridge in 1988, he was elected a Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He moved from St John&#x27;s when he was elected Master of Downing College, Cambridge, in 1995. He stepped down as Master in 2000, and was then a Fellow of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, from 2001 to 2008.

From 2008 to 2012, King was Director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford. He was also a Fellow of University College, Oxford, from 2009 to 2012. He was President of Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin, Italy, from 2008 to 2011, and was Chancellor of the University of Liverpool from 2010 to 2013.

===Research===
King has published over 500 papers on his research in chemical physics and on science and policy.

During his time at Cambridge, King had, together with Gabor Somorjai and Gerhard Ertl, shaped the discipline of surface science and helped to explain the underlying principles of heterogeneous catalysis. However, the 2007 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ertl alone.

==Career outside academia==
King was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government and Head of the Government Office for Science from October 2000 to 31 December 2007, under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In that time, he raised the profile of the need for governments to act on climate change and was instrumental in creating the £1 billion Energy Technologies Institute. In 2008 he co-authored &quot;The Hot Topic&quot; on this subject.

During his tenure as Chief Scientific Adviser, he raised public awareness for climate change and initiated several foresight studies. As director of the government&#x27;s Foresight Programme, he created an in-depth horizon scanning process which advised government on a wide range of long-term issues, from flooding to obesity. He also chaired the government&#x27;s Global Science and Innovation Forum from its inception. King advised the government on issues including: the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic 2001; post 9/11 risks to the UK; GM foods; energy provision; and innovation and wealth creation. He was heavily involved in the government&#x27;s Science and Innovation Strategy 2004–2014. He suggested that scientists should honour a Hippocratic Oath for Scientists.

In April 2008, King joined UBS, a Swiss investment bank, as senior science advisor. He left UBS to return to the UK government when he was appointed the Foreign Secretary&#x27;s Special Representative for Climate Change in September 2013.

From 2013 to 2016, King was the first chairman of the Future Cities Catapult, a government-funded body conducting research into smart cities.

In May 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, King formed and led Independent SAGE, a committee of unpaid experts which acts as a &quot;shadow&quot; of the UK government&#x27;s SAGE group to address concerns of lack of transparency and political influence on that body.

== Views ==

=== Climate change ===
In his role as scientific advisor to the UK government King was outspoken on the subject of climate change, saying &quot;&quot;I see climate change as the greatest challenges facing Britain and the World in the 21st century&quot; and &quot;climate change is the most severe problem we are facing today – more serious even than the threat of terrorism&quot;.

He strongly supports the work of the IPCC, saying in 2004 that the 2001 synthesis report &quot;is the best current statement on the state of play of the science of climate change, and that really does represent 1,000 scientists&quot;.

King criticised the Bush administration for what he saw as its failures in climate change policy, saying it is &quot;failing to take up the challenge of global warming&quot;&quot;.

In 2004, King gave evidence to a House of Commons select committee confirming his view that &quot;on a global and geological scale that climate change is the most serious problem we are faced with this century&quot;, and illustrated it with a statement that &quot;Fifty-five million years ago was a time when there was no ice on the earth; the Antarctic was the most habitable place for mammals&quot;. The &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; reported that King had at a later event compared current and projected carbon dioxide levels with the record over the past 60 million years, and in an indirect quote suggested King implied that Antarctica was likely to be the world&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; habitable continent by the end of this century if global warming remains unchecked. At the end of the 2007 programme &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot;, broadcast on Channel 4, Fred Singer ridiculed the reported view of the &quot;chief scientist&quot;; King&#x27;s complaint to Ofcom that the programme was unfair and had not given a chance to clarify was upheld, despite Channel 4&#x27;s arguments that King was not named and had not challenged earlier reporting. 

King became head of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group in 2021, basing public meetings on a similar format to Independent SAGE, and publishing reports advising emission cuts and carbon dioxide removal. He promotes the CCAG&#x27;s 4R planet pathway: &quot;Reducing&quot; emissions; &quot;Removing&quot; the excess greenhouse gases (GHGs) already in the atmosphere; &quot;Repairing&quot; ecosystems; strengthening local and global &quot;Resilience&quot; against inevitable climate impacts.

=== Food production ===
King told &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in February 2007 &quot;he agreed that organic food was no safer than chemically-treated food&quot; and openly supported a study by the Manchester Business School that implicated organic farming practices in unfavourable CO2 comparisons with conventional chemical farming.

In an article published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in February 2009, King is quoted as saying that &quot;future historians might look back on our particular recent past and see the Iraq war as the first of the conflicts of this kind – the first of the resource wars&quot; and that this was &quot;certainly the view&quot; (that the invasion was motivated by a desire to secure energy supplies) he held at the time of the invasion, along with &quot;quite a few people in government&quot;.

=== Energy ===
King is a strong supporter of nuclear electricity generation, arguing that it is a safe, technically feasible solution that can help to reduce emissions from the utilities sector now, while the development of alternative low-carbon solutions is incentivised. In the transport sector, King has warned governments that conventional oil resources are more scarce than they believe and that peak oil might approach sooner than expected. Moreover, he has criticised first generation biofuels due to the effect on food prices and subsequent effect on the developing world. He strongly supports second generation biofuels, however, which are manufactured from inedible biomass such as corn stover, wood chips or straw. These biofuels are not made from food sources (see food vs fuel).

King is a member of the Global Apollo Programme and headed its public launch in 2015. The programme calls for multinational research into reducing the cost of low-carbon electricity generation.

=== Humanism ===

King is a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK.

=== Covid response ===

In July 2020 King advocated for school closures in the UK until covid cases were reduced to 1 in a million.

<text>Bogoria is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in medieval Poland and later under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, branches of the original medieval Bogoriowie family as well as families connected with the Clan by adoption.

==History==
The coat of arms was first attributed to Michał Bogorya, whose name was first recorded in the papers of Trzemeszno monastery, when he was given the title of count, and in a decree granting privileges to the Holy Cross monastery near Sandomierz around 1069. According to legend, Bolesław II the Bold (Bolesław Śmiały), armed with only 3,000 of his cavalry, attacked a much larger band of Polovtsy near Snowskie, striking down their leader. During the battle a colonel called Michał Bogorya proved extraordinary courage and bravery, bearing several wounds and arrows in his body. Bolesław, upon returning from the battle and hearing of his bravery, saw Bogorya and extracted the arrows from his chest, broke them with his own hands and conferred them on Bogorya and his descendants as an eternal honour.

==Blazon==
The coat of arms consists of two broken white (or silver) arrows pointing in opposite directions—one up and one down—on a red (or blue/green) field. The helm bears a peacock with its tail spread and its beak pointing to the shield&#x27;s right, holding an arrow likewise broken and twisted upward.

==Notable bearers==

<text>Godziemba is a Polish coat of arms. A rare medieval Polish knightly coat of arms used by Polish and Austrian noble family Głownia (and Glownia). 

It is mentioned for the first time in years 1470-1480 by famous Polish chronicler Jan Długosz in his book &quot;Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis&quot; (&quot;Book of the Benefices of the Bishopric of Kraków&quot;) with the name &quot;&quot;Paulus de Glownia nobilis de domo Godzamba&quot;. This is Polish nobility coat of arms as well as knightly &quot;Arma Baronum Regni Polonie&quot;&quot; coat of arms.

==History==
The legendary history of the Godziemba coat of arms goes back to the 11th century, a common telling is as follows:

In 1094 A.D., Sieciech was Voivode of Kraków. In this year the Moravians invaded Poland in force. When the Polish learned that the enemy had camped for the night within the vicinity, a vanguard was assembled to engage in a surprise offensive. The Polish vanguard subsequently ambushed the enemy, and brought them to battle. The knight Godziemba, a member of the Polish vanguard, lost his weapon in the skirmish, and retreated into a nearby forest. One of the Moravians, seeing that he was unarmed, pursued him. Godziemba sprang from his horse and uprooted a young pine tree from the soil. He fended off his attacker with the makeshift weapon and eventually managed to knock his pursuer from his horse. He then disarmed him, made him a prisoner, and delivered him to Voivode Sieciech. In commemoration of the brave and noble deed he received a coat of arms depicting the spruce, with his heroic image displayed on the crest.

It has been debated that the event is nothing more than a fictitious legend. This is based on grounds that it took place before the art of heraldry was ever in practice. Nonetheless, the story is significant to the over-all history of the blazon and crest.

==Blazon==
Gules field with three pronged pine (sometimes fir, sometimes spruce) eradicated proper. Out of the crest coronet, Hero Godziemba in argent armor holding the three pronged spruce in dexter hand, all proper.

==Notable bearers==

Notable bearers of this coat of arms include:

* Jan Lubrański Bishop, politician and diplomat, (1456–1520)
* Stanisław Dąmbski Bishop (ca. 1638-1700)
* Kazimierz Sosnkowski Inspector General of the Armed Forces of Poland, (1885–1969)
* Jerzy Sosnkowski Architect, interior designer and writer, (1894-1954)

<text>Appleshaw is a village and Civil parish in the Test Valley district of north-west Hampshire, England.


== Location ==

=== The Village ===
The village of Appleshaw ( /ˈæpl.ʃɔː/ ) is located close to several other villages. These include: Fyfield, Thruxton, Kimpton, Redenham and Weyhill. There are also 3 local towns; Ludgershall and Tidworth in the county of Wiltshire, and Andover in Hampshire.

=== The Civil Parish ===
The Civil parish of Appleshaw borders the other civil parishes of: Kimpton, Kyfield and Penton Grafton in Hampshire, and Chute Forest and Ludgershall in Wiltshire. Part of the border of the parish of Appleshaw makes up the Wiltshire-Hampshire border.

The parish includes a few hamlets as well as the village of Appleshaw. This includes Ragged Appleshaw which&#x27;s name &quot;ragged&quot; could possibly come from a corruption of &#x27;roe gate&#x27; - the gate of the Royal Deer Forset of Chute.

Parts of Redenham Park lie within the parish.

== History ==

=== Fairs ===
In 1658, the parish was granted the right to two annual fairs, Appleshaw became a rival to the great Weyhill sheep fair. In 1801, The &quot;Salisbury Journal&quot; reported that 15,000 sheep were sold at Appleshaw, a reduction on the previous year&#x27;s total.

== Sports ==
W. G. Grace once played cricket here, with his bat made of Wallop willow.

=== Recreation areas ===

In the middle of the street a clock sticks out from a barn wall, placed there to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee.

The name Appleshaw is derived from Old English ‘scarga’ - a shaugh or wood; thus Appleshaw may mean ‘apple wood’.

==Education==
Appleshaw has one school, Appleshaw St Peter&#x27;s CE Primary School.

<text>Harlan Township is one of the eleven townships of Warren County, Ohio, United States. It is located in the southeast corner of the county. The population was 4,929 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Located in the southeastern corner of the county, it borders the following townships:
*Washington Township - north
*Vernon Township, Clinton County - northeast
*Marion Township, Clinton County - east
*Wayne Township, Clermont County - southeast
*Goshen Township, Clermont County - southwest
*Hamilton Township - west
*Salem Township - northwest

The two tiny villages of Butlerville and Pleasant Plain are located in Harlan Township, as well as the unincorporated community of Level.

==Name and history==
The only Harlan Township statewide, it is named for Aaron Harlan of Xenia, a member of the Ohio General Assembly that created the township and who formerly represented the area in Congress.

Harlan Township was organized in 1860. It was created by the Ohio General Assembly by the Act of March 16, 1860 (Ohio Laws, volume 57, page 135), which took effect that day. It divided the existing Salem Township into two parts, the northern part to be called Corwin Township, the southern to be called Harlan.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Public services==
The Little Miami, Blanchester, Goshen, and Clinton Massie school districts serve the township. Mail is delivered through the Pleasant Plain, Clarksville, Morrow, Goshen, and Blanchester post offices. The Little Miami Telephone Company&#x27;s Butlerville exchange serves most of the township, but parts of Harlan Township lie in the Little Miami, Blanchester, Morrow, and Clarksville telephone exchanges.

<text>Pomian is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
On the shield is the black head of a bison on a yellow field, with a sword driven into the head so that both the top and the bottom of the sword are visible. Above the helmet on the crown is an arm in armor with a bare hand holding a sword.

The origin of this coat-of-arms can be traced back to 1279, when Hebda, brother of Jaranda, performed public deeds of merit to atone for the sins of his murdered brother. One of his brave acts was the killing of a bison that had been plaguing the village of Lubania. During the reign of Walter II, King of Poland, the bison head was placed on the shield and the arm with a sword was placed above the crown and was named Pomian. This is a communal coat-of-arms and is shared by other Great Polish Families.

==Blazon==
The Pomian coat of arms, being borne by multiple families, as with most Polish armorial bearings, has multiple variations to the basic design. The example image on this page may be blazoned as follows:&quot;Arms: Or, a buffalo&#x27;s head caboshed, sable, pierced with a sword, proper. Mantling: Sable, doubled Or. Crest: Out of a ducal coronet, an arm embowed in armor holding in its hand a sword, proper.&quot;

<doc id="1065179" wikidata="Q2142182" url="?curid=1065179" title="Horseman's pick">
<text>The horseman&#x27;s pick is a weapon of Middle Eastern origin used by cavalry during the Middle Ages in Europe and the Middle East. It is a type of war hammer that has a very long spike on the reverse of the hammer head. Usually, this spike is slightly curved downwards, much like a miner&#x27;s pickaxe. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;war hammer&quot;. A metal-made horseman&#x27;s pick called &quot;nadziak&quot; was one of the main weapons of the famous Polish Winged Hussars. A weapon of late make, the horseman&#x27;s pick was developed by the English and used by billmen. It was used with great success during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. A use of the horseman&#x27;s pick was to tear men from their mounts.

The horseman&#x27;s pick was often used as a means to penetrate thick plate armour or mail which the standard sword could not. However, a number of drawbacks limited the weapon&#x27;s effectiveness. Its relative heaviness made it unwieldy and, thus, easily avoided. The injury caused by the weapon was also small and rarely immediately fatal. Additionally, if swung too hard, the weapon often became embedded in the victim or their armour, making retrieval difficult.

<text>Percy Roycroft Lowe (2 January 1870 – 18 August 1948) was an English surgeon and ornithologist.

== Life ==

Lowe was born at Stamford, Lincolnshire and studied medicine at Jesus College, Cambridge. He served as a civil surgeon in the Second Boer War, and it was whilst in South Africa that he became interested in ornithology. On his return he became private physician to Sir Frederick Johnstone, 8th Baronet, whose constant travel exposed Lowe to birds all around the world.

During World War One he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps; he was Officer in Command on Princess Christian Ambulance Train for which he was awarded the OBE in 1920.

Lowe worked with Dorothea Bate on fossil ostriches in China.

In November 1919 he succeeded William Robert Ogilvie-Grant as Curator of Birds at the Natural History Museum, retiring on his sixty-fifth birthday in 1935. He was succeeded by Norman Boyd Kinnear.

He was editor of the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club from 1920 to 1925 and president of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union from 1938 to 1943. In 1933 he was one of eleven people involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), an organisation for the study of birds in the British Isles. His 1936 publication &quot;The finches of the Galapagos in relation to Darwin&#x27;s conception of species&quot; introduced the term &quot;Darwin&#x27;s finches&quot;.

In 1939 he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union and in 1946 was awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal of the British Ornithological Union.

An extinct species of penguin, &quot;Archaeospheniscus lowei&quot;, was named in his honor to recognize his research into penguin fossils.

<text>Criminal tattoos are classified in different ways. The meaning and histories of criminal tattoos vary from country to country, and they are commonly assumed to be associated with gang membership. They could also be a record of the wearer&#x27;s personal history—such as their skills, specialties, accomplishments, incarceration, world view and/or means of personal expression. Tattoos have been empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and criminality. There is no direct correlation between tattoos and criminals, but we can observe the developed history of tattoos and their meanings in countries such as Australia, France, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United States.

== History ==
The art of tattooing dates back to 8000 BC when it was used as a means of identification amongst different cultures. Ancient Greek and Roman histories, as well as ancient Japanese and Chinese histories possess a record of criminality being associated with tattoos, but it was not until the 16th to 18th century that this notion became more prevalent in other parts of the world. Over time, tattooing began to be used to mark prisoners and those who committed crimes, so law enforcement would be able to monitor those who disrupted and caused harm to communities. As a means of tracking criminals, noting a person&#x27;s tattoos became an efficient way to document them. It provided a unique descriptor that set a criminal apart from others.

Rebels and lawless individuals started to mark themselves with tattoos to signify their actions which they took pride in or identified with; this could be acts of rebellion, crimes, personal beliefs, and commitment to a certain group. Convicts had knowledge of their tattoos being used to exercise more control over them, but the rebellious, individuality of tattoos proved to be more important.

==Criminal tattoos by country==

===Australia===
Prisoners who were transported from Britain to Australian penal colonies between 1787 and 1867 were sometimes tattooed with marks intended to signify disgrace, for example, D for deserter. Prisoners often modified these tattoos to conceal the original design or to express wry or rebellious messages.
A common prison tattoo in Australia is &#x27;A.C.A.C.&#x27; - the initials to a derogatory phrase regarding cops.

===France===
In France, five dots tattoo resembling the dots on a dice, placed on the hand between index finger and thumb are found on prison inmates. This tattoo represents the individual between the four walls of the prison cell (&quot;un homme entre quatre murs&quot;—a man between four walls); this also has the same meaning in Russia, Germany and Spain.

Tattoos of three dots on the hand mean &quot;death to cops&quot; (&quot;mort aux vaches / flics / poulets / keufs&quot;), also used in Germany, &quot;nichts sehen, nichts hören, nichts sagen&quot; (&quot;see/hear/say nothing&quot;= no snitch/ing.)

A single dot on the cheek usually means the wearer is a pimp (&quot;point des maquereaux&quot;).

A stick figure holding a trident is also a common French prison tattoo.

===Italy===
Towards the end of the 19th century, Italy implemented the Bertillonage system as a means to identify criminals; this method was used to also target anyone who was a threat to social order and was deemed &quot;suspicious&quot;.

Tattoos were not only seen on criminals but it was viewed as a common trait amongst criminals within the Bertillonage system. People with tattoos were set apart from others, and it was used as evidence that they were to be seen as different in the general public. This idea was applied to perceiving someone&#x27;s psyche and deducing if they are biologically inclined to criminal behavior, as higher pain tolerance, primal nature, and shameless attitudes were associated with a predisposition towards criminal behavior.

Specific, identifiable tattoos are seen within organized crime. &quot;La Stidda,&quot; a Mafia-style criminal organization in Sicily, is known for using star tattoos to identify members. This small, five-point star is called a &quot;stiddari&quot; and is typically placed between the thumb and index finger on the right hand.

===Japan===

The Edo period in Japan exemplified the strive for internal peace within the country. Tattoos started to be used to mark those who committed crimes which began the correlation between tattoos and criminals. The Meiji restoration period followed the Edo period; Japan aimed to be viewed as more civilized during this time, so tattooing grew to be deemed barbaric and was outlawed throughout the country.

Yakuza, the organized crime syndicate of Japan, dates back to the 17th century and maintains a strong loyalty. A form of committing is by embracing tattoos which make them identifiable within the gang and to the public.

The Yakuza&#x27;s tattoos would cover large areas of the body. The tattoos could cover arms, chest, back, and legs, but may not be visible when wearing traditional Japanese garments, such as a kimono, due to the specific placement. As a member of the Yakuza, enduring the painful process of tattooing was viewed as a declaration of loyalty and courage. Modern yakuza tattoos, with common symbols and visual motifs, are noted for their similarity to current Western tattoo styles. Current Yakuza have full-body tattoos, typically inked in secret by tattoo artists associated with clans. Due to a clear association between tattoo artistry and crime, the practice was shortly banned following the Meiji restoration period. During the US occupation after World War II, this law was repealed.

Due to the association between the Yakuza and tattoos, the stigmatization of tattoos in Japan has become a part of their cultural norm. As the public grew more knowledgeable of criminal activity, the portrayal of gangs became more evident in popular films, so this grew a specific connotation between a tattoo on an individual and a suspected criminal association. Although Yakuza membership declined after the Anti-Organized Crime Law was enacted in 1991 and enforced in 1992, the gang is still active. As a means of avoiding interactions with gang members in public and the history of the association, tattooed individuals, regardless of gang affiliation, are not permitted to enter a number of establishments due to societal standards and expectations.

===Russia===
Russian criminal tattoos have a complex system of symbols that can give quite detailed information about the wearer. Not only do the symbols carry meaning, but the area of the body on which they are placed may be meaningful too. The initiation tattoo of a new gang member is usually placed on the chest and may incorporate a rose. A rose on the chest is also used within the Russian mafia. Wearing false or unearned tattoos is punishable in the criminal underworld, usually by removal of the tattoo, followed by beatings and sometimes rape, or even murder. Tattoos can be removed (voluntarily, in the case of loss of rank, new affiliation, &quot;lifestyle&quot; change, etc.) by bandaging magnesium powder onto the surface of the skin, which dissolves the skin bearing the marks with painful caustic burns. This powder is gained by filing &quot;light alloy,&quot; e.g., lawnmower casing and is a jailhouse commodity.

&quot;As Russia&#x27;s leading expert on tattoo iconography, Mr. Arkady Bronnikov can tell the prisoner&#x27;s story from looking at the designs on his body. The huge spider in a web that is drawn on his skull reveals, in prison tattoo code, that he is a drug addict. Also, he is a repeat offender: The onion domes of a Russian church fan across his shoulder blades, each of the seven domes representing a different stay in prison. Above the church, across the back of his neck, the convict has stenciled, in Russian, &quot;Not just anyone can hold his head this high.&quot;... &quot;The more tattoos a convict gets, the more sentences he has served, the more respect he gets in prison,&quot; says Mr. Bronnikov. &quot;The tattoos show that he isn&#x27;t afraid of pain.&quot;

Tattoos made in a Russian prison often have a distinct bluish color (due to being made with ink from a ballpoint pen) and usually appear somewhat blurred because of the lack of instruments to draw fine lines. The ink is often created from burning the heel of a shoe and mixing the soot with urine, and injected into the skin utilizing a sharpened guitar string attached to an electric shaver.

&quot;In [Russian] prison, the ink for tattoos was manufactured from molten rubber mixed with water and sugar. Artists used sewing needles sharpened on concrete cell floors. Sometimes, portraits of Stalin and Lenin--with or without horns--were in fashion, sometimes monasteries and medieval knights. Occasionally, caricatures of Communists with pig snouts or correctional officers in wolf guise were the rage. Maps of the gulag system, with Russia, portrayed as a giant prison camp, might be etched across someone&#x27;s back. Crucifixion scenes were popular. Ronald Reagan was even a subject, according to a Russian dictionary of prison slang (Fenya).&quot;

In addition to voluntary tattooing, tattoos are used to stigmatize and punish individuals within the criminal society. These tattoos may be placed on an individual who fails to pay debts in card games, or otherwise breaks the criminal code, and often have very blatant sexual images, embarrassing the wearer. Tattoos on the forehead are sometimes forcibly applied, and designed both to humiliate the bearer and warn others about him or her. They frequently consist of slurs about the bearer&#x27;s ethnicity, sexual orientation, or perceived cooperation with the prison authorities. They can indicate that the holder is a member of a political group considered offensive by other prisoners (e.g., Vlasovite), or has been convicted of a crime (such as child rape) that is disapproved of by other criminals. They can also advertise that the bearer is &quot;downcast&quot;, or of the lowest social caste in prison, usually used for the sexual gratification of higher-ranked inmates. Voluntary facial tattoos signify that the bearer does not expect to be released back into normal society within his lifetime, and will usually consist of tattoos on the eyelids of messages such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Wake Me Up.&quot; They are managed by inserting a metal spoon under the eyelid, so the tattoo needle does not pierce the eye.

Tattoos that consist of political or anti-authoritarian statements are known as &quot;grins&quot;. They are often tattooed on the stomach of a thief in law, as a means of acquiring status in the criminal community. A Russian criminologist, Yuri Dubyagin, has claimed that, during the Soviet era, there existed &quot;secret orders&quot; that an anti-government tattoo must be &quot;destroyed surgically&quot;, and that this procedure was usually fatal. Tattoos of the portraits of Soviet leaders like Lenin and Stalin were often applied on the chest due to a belief that firing squads were forbidden to shoot at the leaders&#x27; pictures.

N. Banerjee wrote in 1992 for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; about tattoos in Russian prisons: 
:&quot;...the pain does deter even the most macho convict from covering his body, all at once, with meaningful pictures. Tattoos are created by instilling pigment in the skin with thousands of needle pricks. In the camps, the process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few years, depending on the artist and his ambition, says Mr. Bronnikov. Because of prison conditions, tattoo artists have to improvise with materials and equipment. For instance, they will draw a picture on a wooden plank, place needles along the lines of the design, cover the needles with ink and stamp the whole tableau on the prisoner&#x27;s body. Another method is to slice the image onto the skin with a razor and daub the cut with indelible ink. Usually, prisoners manage to get an electric shaver and a syringe with a needle, which they jury-rig into a tattooing machine. Ink is hard to come by, so to make dye, artists will often burn the heel of a shoe, and mix the ash with the prisoner&#x27;s urine -- a practice convicts believe reduces the chance of infection.&quot;

Common body tattoos and their significance (these tattoos are most characteristic of the Old Regime when the Vory V Zakone was more structured in prisons):

*243 in a badge: signifies the wearer has committed battery on a police officer. Often worn on the arm or hand used for the assault. Taken from the California penal code.
*Barbed wire across the forehead signifies a sentence of life imprisonment without a possibility of parole. Barbed wire on the forearms or around the wrist signifies years served.
*Bells indicate a sentence served in full. 
*Birds over the horizon: &quot;I was born free and should be free.&quot; Bearer longs for a life outside prison.
*Cat: a career as a thief. A single cat means the bearer worked alone; several cats mean the bearer was part of a gang. The word &quot;cat,&quot; in Russian, forms an acronym indicating the wearer&#x27;s natural home is in prison. Alternately, can signify cleverness.
*Celtic Cross: Part of the racist white power movement. It has also been used to represent crosshairs of a gun, meaning that a wearer is a hitman, and he too will meet a violent end one day.
*Churches, mosques, fortresses, etc., are often tattooed on the chest, back, or hand. The number of spires or towers can represent the years a prisoner has been incarcerated or the number of times he has been imprisoned. A cross at the top of the spire indicates that the sentence was paid in full. The phrase, &quot;The Church is the House of God,&quot; often inscribed beneath a cathedral, has the metaphorical meaning, &quot;Prison is the Home of the Thief.&quot;
* Cross: A small cross either on the forehead, finger, or between the thumb and forefinger is sometimes seen on convicts as a symbol of serving time in prison. There is another category of tattoos—of rings on the fingers and symbols on the hands—which informs other inmates of the bearer&#x27;s rank when the bearer is clothed: A cross on the chest can represent a high ranking in the Russian mob.
*Crosses on knuckles: &#x27;Trips to the zone&#x27;. &#x27;I&#x27;ve been in prison three times&#x27;.
*Dagger in neck: Signifies that owner of tattoo cut someone.
*Devil&#x27;s head: &#x27;Grin&#x27;. &#x27;I hold a grudge against the authorities&#x27;.
*Dots
**Dots on knuckles: number of years served in prison.
**Five dots: Represents time done in prison. Four of the dots represent walls, while the fifth represents the prisoner.
**Single dot: &#x27;I escaped&#x27;.
*Epaulets: Military badge and uniform are worn on the shoulders. This symbolizes criminal accomplishments. When a skull symbol is portrayed with it, it usually designates a man as a murderer. Epaulets are decorated with certain crests and symbols in the sections where one can see the skull there before conviction, especially when it was of any significance.
*Executioner: Murderer, or that they follow the Thieves&#x27; Code
*Goat: Informer, an animal without honor. Probably begrudged as a mark of humiliation.
*Lenin, Stalin, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels: Usually tattooed across the chest or over vital organs. Mostly characteristic of the Old Regime; prisoners would tattoo them because it was believed the firing squads could not shoot the images of USSR&#x27;s founding fathers.
*Madonna and baby Jesus indicates that the bearer is &#x27;clean before his friends&#x27; in that he will never betray them to authorities. May also symbolize having become a criminal early in life.
*Mermaid: indicates a conviction of child molestation
*MIR: The Russian word for &quot;peace,&quot; an acronym that indicates &quot;only a firing squad will reform me.&quot;
*Spider or spider web: may symbolize racism or doing time in prison
*Spider Web: If the spider is in the center, the bearer is dedicated to a life of crime; if it is climbing out of the web, the bearer is trying to reform himself. A few other versions are that the wearer is a drug addict, like an insect trapped in a spider&#x27;s web, he is trapped in some narcotic web, or that it signifies a time in prison as each ring of the spider web represents one year in prison.
*Teardrop tattoo: A teardrop underneath an eye: the wearer was raped in prison and tattooed with a teardrop under the eye by the offending party, this was a way of &quot;marking&quot; an inmate as property or to publicly humiliate the inmate as face tattoos cannot be hidden. In West Coast gang culture, the tattoo may signify that the wearer has killed someone.
*Tombstones represent the loss of time. You may see the number of years that are served (i.e., five tombstones reading 2001–2005 means the prisoner has done five years).
*SLON: an acronym that spells the Russian word for elephant but which stands for, &#x27;From my early years nothing but misery&#x27; or &#x27;Death to cops by knife&#x27;.
*SS: Sohranil Sovest - Sign of against prison authorities.
*Stars: Worn on the knees: signifies that an owner &#x27;will kneel before no man&#x27;.
*Stars: Worn on the shoulders: Signifies that the owner is a man of discipline, status, and tradition. Men will also receive stars when promoted to &quot;Captain&quot; in the Vory V Zakone.
*Swastika: Against prison authorities. Does not literally mean that the wearer is a Nazi sympathiser.

===United States===
Tattoos can commonly be found on those related to a gang, as they represent pride in their membership. The symbols and typefaces used will vary and can indicate which gang one may belong to; the location of the tattoo is also notable, as it indicates the level of exposure and potential identification one may want to have in the general public.

One of the most well-known criminal tattoos is the teardrop tattoo. This is more symbolic of criminal activity among West Coast gangs where a teardrop tattoo underneath the eye can indicate whether an individual committed murder or attempted murder. Other meanings of this tattoo are indicating time spent in prison or the loss of a loved one associated with a gang.

A common tattoo in American prisons for Hispanic inmates is four dots or three dots. The dots represent that you have earned your keep in your gang. The three dots would represent the 13 of the southern gangs and the same for the northern gangs with four dots :: for 14. Geographic location is commonly referred to, so another identifiable tattoo is an area code (Ex. 213 would represent Los Angeles). Hispanic gangs have a trend of using old English script and incorporating religious themes in their tattoos, as a substantial portion of members and their families are Catholic. Their tattoos are frequently larger and easily visible.

Markers of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white Neo-Nazi prison gang include but are not limited to the letters &quot;AB&quot;, Celtic imagery, and the number 666. Themes of racism are evident in Aryan Brotherhood gang tattoos through white supremacist language and Nazi references.

==== Prison tattoos ====
In the United States, the tattooing of criminals increased in the 1930s, and this could be attributed to tattooing in prisons. Although tattooing is highly prohibited in U.S. prisons, inmates take part and accept the disciplinary action often taken. Studies have shown that inmates would receive tattoos while serving their sentence are more extroverted; they have a sense of belonging and embrace being a prisoner. This trait is coupled with a lack of self-discipline.

Since tattooing in prison is illegal in many jurisdictions, the inmates do not have the proper equipment necessary for the practice. This forces inmates to find ways to create their own tattooing devices out of their belongings. The ink used to create the tattoo requires a certain quality to appear correctly. Inmates can acquire ink a number of ways: street ink from visits or corrections officers or it could be created with a few components. Ink could be made with water, isopropyl alcohol, and black soot. Improvising meant burning various materials to acquire the soot and ingredients containing alcohol such as mouthwash. Improvised tattooing equipment has been assembled from materials such as mechanical pencils, Bic pens, radio transistors, staples, paper clips, or guitar strings.

Certain tattoo designs have developed recognized coded meanings. The code systems can be quite complex, and because of the nature of what they encode, the designs of criminal tattoos are not widely recognized as such to outsiders. Coded prison tattoos commonly found in North America:

* Three dots making a triangle - typically between the thumb and forefinger
* Teardrop - under the eye; multiple meanings, commonly symbolizes committing or attempted murder
* Shamrock - no specific location on body; indicates belonging to Aryan Brotherhood
** The shamrock can include the number 12, referencing the letters &quot;AB&quot;
* Area codes - no specific location on body; gang members will identify with the area code of their neighborhood or gang&#x27;s location
* Spider web - typically found covering the elbow; white supremacists use this symbol to outwardly express that they have injured or killed
* Clock with no hands - symbolizes time spent in prison and serving a sentence
* The number 13 - demonstrates being a member of the Mara Salvatrucha 13 gang
* The number 14 - demonstrates being a member of the Nuestra Familia, a prison gang

==Tattoos for enslaved prostitutes==
Forced and enslaved prostitutes are often tattooed or branded with a mark of their pimps. Women and girls being forced into prostitution against their will may have their pimps&#x27; name or gang symbol inked or branded with a hot iron on their skin. In some organizations involved with the trafficking of women and girls, like the mafias, nearly all prostitutes are marked. Some pimps and organizations use their name or well-known logo, while others use secret signs.
In the past, the branding mark was usually small, sometimes hidden between the labia minora. Today, some pimps write their names in big letters all upon the body of the victim.

<text>Benon Vahe Sevan (born December 18, 1937 Nicosia, Cyprus) was the head of the United Nations&#x27; Oil-for-Food Programme, established in 1996 and charged with preventing Iraq&#x27;s government from using the proceeds from oil exports for anything but food, medicine and other items to benefit the civilian population.

== Biography ==
Born into an Armenian-Cypriot family in Cyprus, Sevan was educated at the prestigious Melkonian Educational Institute in Nicosia. He obtained a BA in History and Philosophy at Columbia College, New York City, and a further degree from the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.

He joined the United Nations in 1965 and worked, among other places, for a U.N.-administered plebiscite in West Irian, as well as on issues related to prisoners of war in the Iran-Iraq conflict. From 1982 to March 1988, Sevan was Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In April 1988, he was appointed director and senior political advisor to the Secretary-General&#x27;s representative on the Afghan conflict. In January 1991, the Secretary-General appointed him to head the Office coordinating humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. On April 15, 1992, as Afghan president Mohammad Najibullah readied his resignation amidst the collapse of his government, Sevan flew alone to Kabul to escort Najibullah into exile. However, as Najibullah approached the airport, his car was blocked by militia forces loyal to Abdul Rashid Dostum. Najibullah quickly backtracked into the city and took refuge at the Kabul UN compound (where he was to remain for the next four years, until the Taliban took control and killed him).

Later in July 1992, he was named Assistant Secretary-General in the UN Department of Political Affairs. But Sevan came to world attention as investigations began into the Oil-for-Food Programme. Sevan reportedly accepted bribes from Saddam Hussein in the form of oil vouchers, and allowed Saddam to garner $11 billion for military and other uses which violated the UN sanctions against his regime, even as Sevan tried to persuade the United Nations Security Council to make concessions to the Iraqi regime.

On August 19, 2003, Sevan was wounded in the Canal Hotel Bombing.

On 7 February 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan suspended Sevan and another UN official with pay ($1 per year plus benefits, including diplomatic immunity from prosecution) because of their roles in the fraud. On 8 August 2005, a UN-appointed panel, led by Paul Volcker, published a report on its investigation into the scandal. In the report, the panel concluded that Sevan had accepted bribes from the former Iraqi regime and recommended that his UN immunity be lifted, to allow for a criminal investigation. Sevan had resigned from the UN on 7 August 2005, just one day before the report was due to be published.

In October 2005, it was reported he had fled the US and returned to his native Cyprus. The extradition treaty between the US and Cyprus does not require Cyprus to send Sevan to the US.

Sevan is married with one daughter.

<text>John Sasso (born 1946/1947) is an American Democratic political operative who ran the 1988 election bid by Michael Dukakis.

==Life and career==

Sasso was born in New Jersey. Initially a teacher, he began his political career as an organizer for Congressman Gerry Studds, and gained note as an organizer for Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Iowa primaries. Having worked on Michael Dukakis&#x27;s 1982 campaign for Massachusetts Governor, Sasso served as his Chief of Staff from 1983 to 1987; Dukakis then appointed him as campaign manager for his presidential bid, after Sasso persuaded the governor that he could win nationally. Sasso was primarily responsible for creating the strategy and organization that allowed Dukakis to win the Democratic nomination in a crowded field.

Before the first primaries, however, Sasso was identified as the person responsible for the distribution of a videotape showing similarities between a speech by Sen. Joseph Biden, a Dukakis rival for the nomination, and British politician Neil Kinnock, leading to Sasso&#x27;s forced resignation from the Dukakis campaign.

With Dukakis trailing George H. W. Bush by double digits in the polls, however, Dukakis recalled Sasso to the campaign just before Labor Day. Ultimately, resistance to Sasso&#x27;s resuming management of the campaign from the still official &quot;campaign manager&quot;, Susan Estrich, a Harvard Law School Professor, hampered Sasso&#x27;s efforts to turn the campaign&#x27;s fortunes around. Still, the gap was closed to around 53–46 by voting day.

Following the campaign, Sasso became a consultant with an array of major national clients, while continuing to be called upon as a top strategist within the Democratic Party. He was reputed to be ready to head up New York Governor Mario Cuomo&#x27;s presidential campaign had Cuomo run in 1992, but Cuomo declined to enter the race.

===2004 Campaign season===

In 2004 John Kerry brought Sasso in as &quot;the man on the plane&quot; during his own ill-fated presidential campaign, and Sasso emerged from the campaign as one of the few campaign operatives whose reputations were burnished by his role on the campaign. Just prior to that involvement, also at Kerry&#x27;s request, Sasso had taken on a major role for the Democratic National Committee.

One of the largest database repositories on the web, dedicated to the health, maintenance and future of the web of life on planet Earth, focusing on the complex connections among all the myriad aspects from natural and social sciences through water, energy, land, food, agriculture, environment, biodiversity, health, education, culture, engineering and technology, management, development and environmental security carrying knowledge for our times. It has been developed under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The EOLSS body of knowledge is a virtual compendium of Twenty One component encyclopedias (Subject Categories). It is regarded as the world’s largest comprehensive professional publication carrying state-of-the-art, high-quality, peer-reviewed, thematically organized archival content in many traditional disciplines and interdisciplinary subjects including the coverage of transdisciplinary pathways. The contributions are from thousands of scholars from over 100 countries and edited by more than 395 subject experts. It also includes up-to-date coverage of various aspects of sustainable development that are relevant to the current state of the world. The objectives are Education for Sustainable Development and Promotion of Life Support Systems Culture of Peace and Social Justice. In light of the global crisis and the imperative need for sustainable development, it&#x27;s crucial to recognize the growing fragility of Earth&#x27;s life support systems. This urgency was underscored by significant events such as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the &quot;Earth Summit&quot;) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.

It can be regarded as an &#x27;encyclopedia of encyclopedias&#x27;, presenting a wide range of major foundation subjects in a process of gradual development, from a broad overview to great detail under the following categories:

Within these twenty one on-line encyclopedias, there are hundreds of Themes, each of which has been compiled under the editorial supervision of a recognized world expert or a team of experts such as an International Commission specially appointed for the purpose. Each of these &#x27;Honorary Theme Editors&#x27; was responsible for selection and appointment of authors to produce the material specified by EOLSS. On average each Theme contains about thirty chapters. It deals in detail with interdisciplinary subjects, but it is also disciplinary, as each major core subject is covered in great depth by world experts. The EOLSS is different from traditional encyclopedias. It is the result of an unprecedented global effort that has attempted to forge pathways between disciplines in order to address contemporary problems&quot; said UNESCO Director General Koïchiro Matsuura. &quot;A source-book of knowledge that links together our concern for peace, progress, and sustainable development, the EOLSS draws sustenance from the ethics, science and culture of peace. At the same time, it is a forward-looking publication, designed as a global guide to professional practice, education, and heightened social awareness of critical life support issues. In particular, the EOLSS presents perspectives from regions and cultures around the world, and seeks to avoid geographic, racial, cultural, political, gender, age, or religious bias.&quot;

It is regarded as the largest comprehensive professional publication carrying state-of-the-art, thematically organized subject matter for a wide audience at the university level with contributions from thousands of experts from over 101 countries. It is an authoritative resource for education, research and policy making in the 21st century.

<doc id="1065202" wikidata="Q423425" url="?curid=1065202" title="Țuică">
<text>Țuică () is a traditional Romanian spirit that contains ~ 24–86% alcohol by volume (usually 40–55%), prepared only from plums. Other spirits that are produced from other fruit or from a cereal grain are called &quot;rachiu&quot; or &quot;rachie&quot;. &quot;Țuică&quot; is also the foundational element for creating the traditional Romanian &quot;vinars&quot; from different spirited fruits. In 2013, Romania produced of țuică.

It is considered Romania&#x27;s national drink.

==Preparation==

Traditionally, țuică is prepared from early summer (after winemaking is complete). The plums must be left for fermentation (&quot;macerare&quot;) for 6–8 weeks, in large barrels (&quot;butoaie&quot; or &quot;căldări&quot; or &quot;putini&quot;).

According to both tradition and Romanian standards (SR), distillation must be done in a copper still (&quot;cazan&quot;, pictures at ), using a traditional fire source (generally wood, but also charcoal).

The temperature is controlled traditionally by interpreting the sounds that the still makes and by tasting the brew at different points in the process. Usually, this process results in two grades of țuică:

*normal: distilled once, the last to come from the still; between 24–40% alcohol.
*very strong: distilled twice, generally a quarter of the production, and the first to come out of the still; about 50–65% alcohol by volume, stronger than palinka; called &quot;pălincă de prune&quot;, &quot;fățată&quot;, &quot;întoarsă&quot;, or &quot;horincă&quot; depending on the region; the most famous țuică served before a meal; in rural regions, it is customary to serve this drink to a guest.

After distillation, țuică may be left to age between six months and ten years in mulberry aging barrels (the result is pearlescent yellow, has a strong aroma, and is known as &quot;old țuică&quot;, &quot;țuică bătrână&quot;), or it may be consumed immediately (&quot;fresh țuică&quot;, &quot;țuică proaspătă&quot;). The people preparing țuică are sometimes referred to as țuicari, căzănari, or cazangii, but this varies according to geographical region. Mixed with water, țuică should never turn white or opaque. There are several different classifications of țuică based on aging duration, with varieties such as old, selected, superior, etc.

==Types and terminology==
The term &quot;țuică&quot; is defined as a spirit made from plums, although it is also colloquially used to refer to all distilled beverages. The term &quot;palincă&quot; is a generic term for any type of fruit brandy, while &quot;palincă de prune&quot; refers specifically to plum brandy.

Țuică is prepared using traditional methods both for private consumption and for sale. Although this was illegal in the past, the government tolerated the practice due to the traditional character of the beverage. Some communities have acquired production licences and produce it legally. Home distillation in Romania is legal provided the distiller pays an excise tax and produces no more than per household.

The names &quot;horincă&quot; and &quot;turț&quot; are used in the regions of Maramureș and Oaș as synonyms for țuică. These terms are occasionally used in other areas of northern Transylvania. This is codified in the Romanian law &quot;Order No. 368/2008 approving the Rules on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of traditional Romanian beverages&quot;. 

A commercial famous presentation is &quot;țuică cu fruct&quot;. This is a glass bottle of țuică containing a whole plum fruit. It is obtained by hanging empty bottles on trees in spring or early summer and growing the fruit inside the bottle.

==Consumption==

Normally, țuica is only consumed before the meal (traditionally every meal). In most cases, only a shot-sized amount is served, and it is generally sipped. The drink is also present in all traditional parties (&quot;agape&quot;) such as weddings, baptisms, hunting parties, harvest festivals, religious holidays, family reunions, and wakes. In most of rural Romania, țuică is the usual drink to hold a toast with, rather than wine. Usually it is drunk before a meal, as it increases appetite.

A modern portrayal of a modern village inhabitant almost always includes a bottle of țuică. For rural families producing țuică for their own consumption (not commercial) the output can amount between ~ 10 - 200 litres per family per year, as the plum tree is the most widely present tree in Romanian orchards (see also Agriculture in Romania). Țuică is sometimes used as part of a small remuneration package for favors or &quot;daily work&quot; (informal or between friends). 

Romania is the largest plum producer in the European Union and among the top plum producers in the world. According to the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture, around are cultivated with plum trees, and 80% of production is transformed into țuică.

<doc id="1065208" wikidata="Q422882" url="?curid=1065208" title="Glycolipid">
<text>Glycolipids are lipids with a carbohydrate attached by a glycosidic (covalent) bond. Their role is to maintain the stability of the cell membrane and to facilitate cellular recognition, which is crucial to the immune response and in the connections that allow cells to connect to one another to form tissues. Glycolipids are found on the surface of all eukaryotic cell membranes, where they extend from the phospholipid bilayer into the extracellular environment.

== Structure ==
The essential feature of a glycolipid is the presence of a monosaccharide or oligosaccharide bound to a lipid moiety. The most common lipids in cellular membranes are glycerolipids and sphingolipids, which have glycerol or a sphingosine backbones, respectively. Fatty acids are connected to this backbone, so that the lipid as a whole has a polar head and a non-polar tail. The lipid bilayer of the cell membrane consists of two layers of lipids, with the inner and outer surfaces of the membrane made up of the polar head groups, and the inner part of the membrane made up of the non-polar fatty acid tails.

The saccharides that are attached to the polar head groups on the outside of the cell are the ligand components of glycolipids, and are likewise polar, allowing them to be soluble in the aqueous environment surrounding the cell. The lipid and the saccharide form a glycoconjugate through a glycosidic bond, which is a covalent bond. The anomeric carbon of the sugar binds to a free hydroxyl group on the lipid backbone. The structure of these saccharides varies depending on the structure of the molecules to which they bind.

==Metabolism==

===Glycosyltransferases===
Enzymes called glycosyltransferases link the saccharide to the lipid molecule, and also play a role in assembling the correct oligosaccharide so that the right receptor can be activated on the cell which responds to the presence of the glycolipid on the surface of the cell. The glycolipid is assembled in the Golgi apparatus and embedded in the surface of a vesicle which is then transported to the cell membrane. The vesicle merges with the cell membrane so that the glycolipid can be presented on the cell&#x27;s outside surface.

===Glycoside hydrolases===
Glycoside hydrolases catalyze the breakage of glycosidic bonds. They are used to modify the oligosaccharide structure of the glycan after it has been added onto the lipid. They can also remove glycans from glycolipids to turn them back into unmodified lipids.

===Defects in metabolism===
Sphingolipidoses are a group of diseases that are associated with the accumulation of sphingolipids which have not been degraded correctly, normally due to a defect in a glycoside hydrolase enzyme. Sphingolipidoses are typically inherited, and their effects depend on which enzyme is affected, and the degree of impairment. One notable example is Niemann–Pick disease which can cause pain and damage to neural networks.

== Function ==

===Cell–cell interactions===
The main function of glycolipids in the body is to serve as recognition sites for cell–cell interactions. The saccharide of the glycolipid will bind to a specific complementary carbohydrate or to a lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein), of a neighboring cell. The interaction of these cell surface markers is the basis of cell recognitions, and initiates cellular responses that contribute to activities such as regulation, growth, and apoptosis.

===Immune responses===
An example of how glycolipids function within the body is the interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells during inflammation. Selectins, a class of lectins found on the surface of leukocytes and endothelial cells bind to the carbohydrates attached to glycolipids to initiate the immune response. This binding causes leukocytes to leave circulation and congregate near the site of inflammation. This is the initial binding mechanism, which is followed by the expression of integrins which form stronger bonds and allow leukocytes to migrate toward the site of inflammation. Glycolipids are also responsible for other responses, notably the recognition of host cells by viruses.

===Blood types===
Blood types are an example of how glycolipids on cell membranes mediate cell interactions with the surrounding environment. The four main human blood types (A, B, AB, O) are determined by the oligosaccharide attached to a specific glycolipid on the surface of red blood cells, which acts as an antigen. The unmodified antigen, called the H antigen, is the characteristic of type O, and is present on red blood cells of all blood types. Blood type A has an N-acetylgalactosamine added as the main determining structure, type B has a galactose, and type AB has all three of these antigens. Antigens which are not present in an individual&#x27;s blood will cause antibodies to be produced, which will bind to the foreign glycolipids. For this reason, people with blood type AB can receive transfusions from all blood types (the universal acceptor), and people with blood type O can act as donors to all blood types (the universal donor).

== Types of glycolipids ==
* Glycoglycerolipids: a sub-group of glycolipids characterized by an acetylated or non-acetylated glycerol with at least one fatty acid as the lipid complex. Glyceroglycolipids are often associated with photosynthetic membranes and their functions. The subcategories of glyceroglycolipids depend on the carbohydrate attached.
** Galactolipids: defined by a galactose sugar attached to a glycerol lipid molecule. They are found in chloroplast membranes and are associated with photosynthetic properties.
** Sulfolipids: have a sulfur-containing functional group in the sugar moiety attached to a lipid. An important group is the sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols which are associated with the sulfur cycle in plants.
* Glycosphingolipids: a sub-group of glycolipids based on sphingolipids. Glycosphingolipids are mostly located in nervous tissue and are responsible for cell signaling.
** Cerebrosides: a group glycosphingolipids involved in nerve cell membranes.
*** Galactocerebrosides: a type of cerebroseide with galactose as the saccharide moiety
*** Glucocerebrosides: a type of cerebroside with glucose as the saccharide moiety; often found in non-neural tissue.
*** Sulfatides: a class of glycolipids containing a sulfate group in the carbohydrate with a ceramide lipid backbone. They are involved in numerous biological functions ranging from immune response to nervous system signaling. 
** Gangliosides: the most complex animal glycolipids. They contain negatively charged oligosacchrides with one or more sialic acid residues; more than 200 different gangliosides have been identified. They are most abundant in nerve cells.
** Globosides: glycosphingolipids with more than one sugar as part of the carbohydrate complex. They have a variety of functions; failure to degrade these molecules leads to Fabry disease.
** Glycophosphosphingolipids: complex glycophospholipids from fungi, yeasts, and plants, where they were originally called &quot;phytoglycolipids&quot;. They may be as complicated a set of compounds as the negatively charged gangliosides in animals.
* Glycophosphatidylinositols: a sub-group of glycolipids defined by a phosphatidylinositol lipid moiety bound to a carbohydrate complex. They can be bound to the C-terminus of a protein and have various functions associated with the different proteins they can be bound to.

<text>Worldspan is a provider of travel technology and content and a part of the Travelport GDS business. It offers worldwide electronic distribution of travel information, Internet products and connectivity, and e-commerce capabilities for travel agencies, travel service providers and corporations. Its primary system is commonly known as a Global Distribution System (GDS), which is used by travel agents and travel related websites to book airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, tour packages and associated products. Worldspan also hosts IT services and product solutions for major airlines.

==Recent events==
In December, 2006, Travelport, owner of the Galileo GDS, Gullivers Travel Associates (GTA) and a controlling share in Orbitz, agreed to acquire Worldspan. However, at the time, management of Travelport did not commit to the eventual merging of the two GDS systems, saying that they were considering all options, including running both systems in parallel. On August 21, 2007, the acquisition was completed for $1.4 billion and Worldspan became a part of Travelport GDS, which also includes Galileo and other related businesses. On September 28, 2008, the Galileo and Apollo GDS were moved from the Travelport datacenter in Denver, Colorado to the Worldspan datacenter in Atlanta, Georgia (although they continue to be run as separate systems from the Worldspan GDS).

In 2012, Worldspan customers were migrated from the TPF-based FareSource pricing engine to Travelport&#x27;s Linux-based 360 Fares pricing engine already used by Galileo and Apollo. Although the three systems share a common pricing platform, they continue to operate as separate GDS.

==History==
Worldspan was formed in early 1990 by Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and TWA to operate and sell its GDS services to travel agencies worldwide. Worldspan operated very effectively and profitably, successfully expanding its business in markets throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. As a result, in mid-2003, Worldspan was sold by its owner airlines to Citigroup Venture Capital and Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Fund which in turn sold the business to Travelport in 2007.

Worldspan was formed in 1990 by combining the PARS partnerships companies (owned by TWA and Northwest Airlines, Inc.) and DATAS II, a division of Delta Air Lines, Inc. One of Worldspan’s predecessors – TWA PARS – became the first GDS to be installed in travel agencies in 1976. ABACUS, an Asian company owned by a number of Asian airlines, owned a small portion of Worldspan, and Worldspan owned a small portion of Abacus. Worldspan and Abacus entered into a series of business and technology relationships. These relationships were terminated after Abacus engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices, for which Worldspan received a sizable judgement in an arbitration in London.

<doc id="1065214" wikidata="Q190956" url="?curid=1065214" title="Amadeus (film)">
<text>Amadeus is a 1984 American period biographical drama film directed by Miloš Forman, starring F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce. Peter Shaffer adapted it from his 1979 stage play &quot;Amadeus&quot;, originally inspired by Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1830 play &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;. Shaffer described it as a &quot;fantasia on [a real-life] theme&quot;, as it imagines a rivalry between two 18th century Vienna composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (Abraham). Salieri struggles to reconcile his professional admiration and jealous hatred for Mozart, and resolves to ruin Mozart&#x27;s career as his vengeance against God.

&quot;Amadeus&quot; received its world premiere in Los Angeles on September 6, 1984. It was released by Orion Pictures thirteen days later on September 19, 1984, to widespread acclaim as a box office hit, grossing over $90 million. It was nominated for 53 awards and received 40, including eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director), four BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director), and a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film. Abraham and Hulce were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, with Abraham winning. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it 53rd on its 100 Years... 100 Movies list. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1823, aged composer Antonio Salieri attempts suicide and is committed to a psychiatric hospital. He claims that he murdered Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Father Vogler, a Catholic priest, encourages Salieri to confess his sins before God. After the young Vogler fails to recognize him, Salieri plays three old melodies to jog his memory. Vogler cannot recognize the first two (which Salieri wrote) but is relieved to recognize the third (&quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot;) at once. Salieri peevishly reveals that Mozart wrote it.

Salieri begins his confession by saying that he grew up hearing stories of the child prodigy, Mozart. As a youth, Salieri proposed that if God made Salieri a famous musician like Mozart, Salieri would give God his faithfulness, chastity, and diligence. Salieri&#x27;s father soon dies, which he interprets as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri becomes court composer to Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in Vienna. However, he has enough taste to know that Emperor Joseph has no ear for music and that his own compositions will not stand the test of time.

When Salieri meets Mozart for the first time, he immediately knows that Mozart is the better composer but is shocked to learn that Mozart is obscene, immature, and dissolute. Adding to his dismay, he learns that Mozart never needs to pen a second draft of his music (see &quot;Mozart&#x27;s compositional method&quot;), implying divine inspiration. Salieri cannot fathom why God would choose a reprobate like Mozart as His earthly instrument. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on Him by destroying Mozart.

Mozart&#x27;s work is ahead of its time, and he has trouble finding work in Vienna. He spends himself into debt, alarming his wife Constanze. Salieri and Mozart bond over their shared contempt for Emperor Joseph&#x27;s lack of taste, but for the same reason, Mozart is unimpressed by Salieri&#x27;s populist work, which causes Salieri great pain.

Mozart boldly adapts the subversive play &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; into a comedic opera. Salieri rejoices, thinking Mozart&#x27;s career is ruined, but Mozart stuns Salieri by convincing the Emperor to approve the project. However, to Salieri&#x27;s equal disbelief, the Emperor finds the opera boring, and it is promptly cancelled. In response, Mozart composes &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, a dark, serious opera. Salieri is entranced, but vindictively gets that opera cancelled too. Renouncing Vienna&#x27;s artistic establishment, Mozart agrees to write &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; for a commoners&#x27; theater.

After watching &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; five times, Salieri realizes that the dead commander who accuses Giovanni of sin represents Mozart&#x27;s inferiority complex towards his own father. He concocts a plan to humiliate God. He persuades the unstable Mozart that his late father has risen to commission a &quot;Requiem&quot; Mass. He plans to kill Mozart, claim the &quot;Requiem&quot; as his own, and premiere it at Mozart&#x27;s funeral, forcing God to listen as Salieri is acclaimed. Mozart overworks himself, juggling both &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and the &quot;Requiem&quot;. Constanze, who wants him to focus on the &quot;Requiem&quot;, leaves with their son Karl. Although &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; is a success, the dying Mozart collapses before he can finish the &quot;Requiem&quot;.

Desperate to complete his plan, but also desperate for more of Mozart&#x27;s heavenly music, Salieri begs the bedridden Mozart to keep writing the &quot;Requiem&quot;. He takes dictation from Mozart, during which he comes to terms with Mozart&#x27;s superior talent. Mozart thanks Salieri for his friendship and Salieri admits that Mozart is the greatest composer he knows.

Constanze returns and attempts to kick Salieri out of the apartment before he can steal the &quot;Requiem&quot;. To further humiliate Mozart before God, Salieri encouraged Constanze to offer him sexual favors in exchange for helping Mozart&#x27;s career. In the end, the chaste Salieri cannot bring himself to break his vows (nor would he want to help Mozart&#x27;s career). Although Constanze is partially nude at this point, Salieri calls in his attendant to show her out. The episode earns Salieri Constanze&#x27;s eternal hatred. When she kicks Salieri out of the apartment at the end of the film, she bitterly remarks that she does not have a servant to evict him. As Salieri protests, they are both shocked to discover that Mozart has died from exhaustion. Due to his debts, Mozart is unceremoniously buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave.

Back in 1823, Vogler is too shaken to absolve Salieri, who surmises that God would rather destroy His beloved Mozart than allow Salieri to share in the smallest part of Mozart&#x27;s glory. As Salieri is wheeled down a hallway, he proclaims himself the patron saint of mediocrities. He loudly absolves the asylum&#x27;s other patients of their inadequacies as Mozart&#x27;s laughter rings in the air.

==Cast==
==Production==
Kenneth Branagh wrote in his autobiography &quot;Beginning&quot; that he was one of the finalists for the role of Mozart, but was dropped from consideration when Forman decided to make the film with an American cast. Mark Hamill, who replaced Tim Curry as Mozart towards the end of the stage play&#x27;s Broadway run, read with many actresses auditioning for the part of Mozart&#x27;s wife Constanze. However, Forman ultimately decided not to cast him due to his association with the character of Luke Skywalker, feeling that audiences would not believe him as the composer. Meg Tilly was cast as Mozart&#x27;s wife Constanze, but she tore a ligament in her leg the day before shooting started. She was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge. Simon Callow, who played Mozart in the original London stage production of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, was cast as Emanuel Schikaneder, the librettist of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.

The film was shot on location in Prague and in Kroměříž at Kroměříž Castle. Forman was able to shoot scenes in the Tyl Theatre in Prague, where &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; debuted two centuries before. Several other scenes were shot at the Barrandov Studios and Invalidovna building, a former &quot;hôtel des invalides&quot;, built in 1731–1737.

Forman collaborated with American choreographer Twyla Tharp.

Tom Hulce reportedly used John McEnroe&#x27;s mood swings as a source of inspiration for his portrayal of Mozart&#x27;s unpredictable genius. He claimed he did not find Mozart&#x27;s signature laugh until he downed a bottle of whiskey.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Amadeus&quot; holds a score of 90% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 154 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Amadeus&quot;″ liberties with history may rankle some, but the creative marriage of Miloš Forman and Peter Shaffer yields a divinely diabolical myth of genius and mediocrity, buoyed by inspired casting and Mozart&#x27;s rapturous music.&quot; 

Giving the film four out of four stars, Roger Ebert acknowledged that it was one of the &quot;riskiest gambles a filmmaker has taken in a long time&quot;, but added that &quot;there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach&quot;, and ultimately concluded that it was a &quot;magnificent film, full and tender and funny and charming&quot;. Ebert later added the film to his Great Movies list. Peter Travers of &quot;People&quot; magazine said that &quot;Hulce and Abraham share a dual triumph in a film that stands as a provocative and prodigious achievement.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; put it on his list of films worth seeing.

In one negative review, Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said that despite &quot;great material and themes to work with, and such top talent involved,&quot; the &quot;stature and power the work possessed onstage have been noticeably diminished&quot; in the film adaptation. The film&#x27;s many historical inaccuracies have attracted criticism from music historians.

===Box office===
The film grossed $52 million in the United States and Canada and by November 1985, while still in theatres overseas, had grossed over $90 million worldwide to date.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning eight (including Best Picture). At the end of the Oscar ceremony, Laurence Olivier came on stage to present the Oscar for Best Picture. As Olivier thanked the academy for inviting him, he was already opening the envelope. Instead of announcing the nominees, he simply read, &quot;The winner for this is &quot;Amadeus&quot;.&quot; An AMPAS official quickly went onstage to confirm the winner and signaled that all was well before Olivier then presented the award to producer Saul Zaentz. Olivier (in his 78th year) had been ill for many years, and it was because of mild dementia that he forgot to read the nominees. Zaentz then thanked Olivier, saying it was an honor to receive the award from him, before mentioning the other nominees in his acceptance speech: &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, &quot;Places in the Heart&quot; and &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;. Maurice Jarre won Best Original Music Score for his scoring of &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. In his acceptance speech for the award, Jarre remarked &quot;I was lucky Mozart was not eligible this year&quot;.

The film along with &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, &quot;The Artist&quot;, and &quot;Birdman&quot; are the only Best Picture winners never to enter the weekend box office top 5 after rankings began being recorded in 1982. The film peaked at No. 6 during its 8th weekend in theaters. Saul Zaentz produced both &quot;Amadeus&quot; and &quot;The English Patient&quot;.

==Historicity==
From the beginning, writer Peter Shaffer and director Miloš Forman both were open about their desire to create entertaining drama only loosely based on reality, calling the work a &quot;fantasia on the theme of Mozart and Salieri&quot;.

The idea of animosity between Mozart and Salieri was popularized by Alexander Pushkin in 1830 in his play &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;. In it, Salieri murders Mozart on stage. The play was made into the opera &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov 67 years later, which in turn had its first screen adaptation by silent-film director Victor Tourjansky in 1914.

Another significant departure in the film is the portrayal of Salieri as a pious loner trapped in a vow of chastity when in reality he was a married family man with eight children and at least one mistress.

Mozart was indeed commissioned to compose a Requiem Mass by an anonymous benefactor. In reality, the patron turned out to be Count Franz von Walsegg, who was grieving after the death of his wife.

==Director&#x27;s Cut==
&quot;Amadeus&quot; premiered in 1984 as a PG-rated movie with a running time of 161 minutes. Director Forman later introduced an R-rated version with nearly 20 minutes of restored footage, which was released by the studios as a &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; on September 24, 2002. Since 2002, the Director&#x27;s Cut has been the only widely available release, as the producers modified the original film negative to include the additional footage, although the producers have promised to re-release the theatrical edition at an unspecified future date.

It is not clear whether the Director&#x27;s Cut represents Forman&#x27;s actual artistic vision. Forman defended the 20 minutes of cuts in his 1993 autobiography &quot;Turnaround&quot;, and repeated his defense in the 1995 supplemental material for Pioneer&#x27;s deluxe LaserDisc. The Director&#x27;s Cut has come under severe criticism, in part because it displaced the theatrical edition, instead of complementing it. Rian Johnson argued that the Director&#x27;s Cut &quot;is bizarrely a sort of inverse master class in editing: It shows exactly why the cuts were made in the first place &amp; how they made the film work.&quot; Roger Ebert noted that the cut was part of a broader wave of directors’ cuts on home video, which he characterized as a “mixed blessing.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;&#x27;s Tasha Robinson noted that most of the additional sequences were either redundant or unnecessary, and broke up the &quot;lively flow between scenes&quot; that marked the theatrical edition&#x27;s &quot;superb[]&quot; editing.&quot;

On the other hand, critics have recognized the merits of some of the additional scenes. Ebert and Robinson agreed that the added scenes better explained Constanze&#x27;s hatred for Salieri, although Robinson questioned whether that subplot actually needed a topless scene. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;&#x27;s Jordan Hoffmann added that the subplot featuring Christine Ebersole as a Salieri-favored singer who sleeps with Mozart, was &quot;splendid.&quot;

More broadly, while promoting the Director&#x27;s Cut, Forman argued that the unlimited running time of home video provided a better environment for the deleted scenes:When you finish a film, before the first paying audience sees it, you don&#x27;t have any idea. You don&#x27;t know if you made a success or a flop when it comes to the box office. And in the &#x27;80s, with MTV on the scene, we are having a three-hour film about classical music, with long names and wigs and costumes. Don&#x27;t forget that no major studio wanted to finance the film, for these reasons. So we said, &quot;Well, we don&#x27;t want to be pushing the audience&#x27;s patience too far&quot;. Whatever was not directly connected to the plot, I just cut it out. But it was a mutual decision [to limit the running time]. I wanted the best life for the film myself... Well, once we are re-releasing it on DVD, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it is two hours and 40 minutes long, or three hours long. So why don&#x27;t we do the version as it was written in the script?In 2024, Saul Zaentz Co. announced that in conjunction with the Academy Film Archive and Teatro Della Pace Film, it had completed a 4K restoration of &quot;Amadeus&quot; (including the theatrical cut) to celebrate the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary. Restorers noted that Paul Zaentz, Saul&#x27;s nephew and successor, personally preferred the theatrical cut to the director&#x27;s cut. The producers announced that a restoration of the theatrical version will be made available on home media.

All tracks on the album were performed specifically for the film. According to the film commentary by Forman and Schaffer, Marriner agreed to score the film if Mozart&#x27;s music was completely unchanged from the original scores. Marriner did add some notes to Salieri&#x27;s music that are noticeable at the beginning of the film, as Salieri begins his confession.

The aria &quot;Ruhe sanft&quot; from the opera &quot;Zaide&quot; does not appear in the film.

===&quot; More Music from the Original Soundtrack&quot;===
In 1985, an additional album with the title &quot;More Music from the Original Soundtrack of the Film Amadeus&quot; was issued containing further selections of music that were not included in the original soundtrack release.
# Mozart: &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, K. 620, Overture
# Mozart: &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, K. 620, act 2, Queen of the Night aria
# Mozart: Masonic Funeral Music, K. 477
# Mozart: Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466, 1st movement
# Antonio Salieri: &quot;Axur, re d&#x27;Ormus&quot;, Finale
# Mozart: Eine kleine Nachtmusik (Serenade No. 13 for Strings in G major), K. 525, 1st movement, arranged for woodwind octet by Graham Sheen
# Mozart: Concerto for Flute and Harp in C major, K. 299, 2nd movement
# Mozart: Six German Dances (Nos. 1–3), K. 509
# Giuseppe Giordani: &quot;Caro mio ben&quot;
# Mozart: &quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;, K. 384, Chorus of the Janissaries (Arr.) and &quot;Ich möchte wohl der Kaiser sein&quot; (&quot;Ein deutsches Kriegslied&quot;), K. 539 (Arr.)

The &quot;Masonic Funeral Music&quot; was originally intended to play over the closing credits, but was replaced in the film by the second movement of the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor (included on the Original Soundtrack Recording).

===Director&#x27;s Cut soundtrack===
In 2002, to coincide with the release of the Director&#x27;s Cut of the film, the soundtrack was remastered with 24-bit encoding and reissued with the title &quot;Special Edition: The Director&#x27;s Cut – Newly Remastered Original Soundtrack Recording&quot; on two 24-karat gold CDs. It contains most of the music from the previous two releases, but with the following differences.

The following pieces were added for this release:
* Salieri&#x27;s March of Welcome turned into &quot;Non più andrai&quot; from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (includes dialogue from the film)
* Adagio in C minor for Glass Harmonica, K. 617 (from a new 2001 recording)
The following pieces, previously released on &quot;More Music from the Original Soundtrack of the Film Amadeus&quot;, were not included:
* Masonic Funeral Music, K. 477
* Six German Dances (Nos. 1–3), K. 509

==Legacy==
A TV series adaptation of the original Shaffer play, called &quot;Amadeus&quot;, starring Will Sharpe and Paul Bettany was scheduled to air on Sky TV in late 2024.

The pink wig worn by Mozart is in the permanent exhibition of the Acadian Museum at the University of Moncton. The wig was created by Paul LeBlanc, who won an Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling for this movie in 1985.

<text>The Haji Ali Dargah is a Sufi mosque and dargah, and the monument of Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, that is located on an islet off the coast of Worli in southern Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra, India.

An exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture, associated with legends about doomed lovers, the dargah contains the tomb of Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. Bukhari was a Sufi saint and a wealthy merchant from Uzbekistan. Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai.

== Background ==

The Haji Ali Dargah was constructed in 1431 in memory of a wealthy Muslim merchant, Sayyed Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, a member of the Chishti Order, who gave up all his worldly possessions before making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Hailing from Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan, Bukhari travelled around the world in the early to mid 15th century, and eventually settled in present-day Mumbai.

According to legends surrounding his life, once the saint saw a poor woman crying on the road, holding an empty vessel. He asked her what the problem was, she sobbed that her husband would thrash her as she stumbled and accidentally spilled the oil she was carrying. He asked her to take him to the spot where she spilt the oil. There, he jabbed a finger into the soil and the oil gushed out. The overjoyed woman filled up the vessel and went home.

Later, Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari had a recurring and disturbing dream that he had injured Earth by his act. Full of remorse and grief from that day he started keeping unwell. Then with the permission of his mother, he traveled to India with his brother and finally reached the shore of Mumbai – near Worli or at some place opposite the present tomb. His brother went back to their native place. Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari sent a letter with him to their mother informing her that he was keeping good health and that he had decided to reside at that place permanently for the spread of Islam and that she should forgive him.
Until his death he kept spreading knowledge about Islam to the people and his devotees would regularly visit him. Before his death he advised his followers that they should not bury him at any proper place or graveyard and should drop his shroud (&#x27;kafan&#x27;) in the ocean such that it should be buried by the people where it is found.
His wish was obeyed by his followers. That is why the Dargah Sharief is built at the very site where his Shroud came to rest in the middle of the sea where it perched on a small mound of rocks rising above the sea. The Tomb and Dargah Sharief were built in the years to come.

== Architecture ==

The &quot;dargah&quot; is built on a tiny islet located from the coast, in the Haji Ali Bay, in the vicinity of Worli. The edifice is a brilliant specimen of the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. The islet is linked to the city precinct of Mahalakshmi by a narrow causeway, which is nearly long.

The whitewashed structure occupies an area of a marble courtyard contains the central shrine. The tomb within the mosque is covered by a brocaded red and green &quot;chaddar&quot; (tomb cover sheet). It is supported by an exquisite silver frame, supported by marble pillars. The main hall has marble pillars embellished with artistic mirror work: blue, green, yellow chips of glass arranged in kaleidoscopic patterns interspersed with Arabic patterns which spell the ninety-nine names of Allah. As per the Muslim traditions, separate praying rooms for female and male worshippers are provided.

=== Repair and renovation ===

, the six-hundred-year-old dargah structure was subject to constant erosion, due to saline winds and the impact of visitors per week. Extensive renovations were completed in 1960 and 1964, and a structural upgrade of the dargah commenced in October 2008. The plans at that time were that the dargah will be beautified with first and second quality white marble, from Makrana, Rajasthan, the same place from where marble for the Taj Mahal was brought. In 2010, it was reported that the repair and structural work was envisaged to take 24 months, over two phases. &quot;Phase One&quot; involved reconstruction of the mosque and minarets; while &quot;Phase Two&quot; involved renovation of the sanitarium building. Upon completion, it was expected that the holy shrine will have the feel of a &quot;taj&quot;, in Mumbai&#x27;s brackish sea water.

== Accessibility ==
The dargah is accessible only during low tide. As the causeway is not bound by railings, when the causeway gets submerged during high tide it becomes inaccessible. During the high tide, the dargah seems completely isolated with no access. The walk on the causeway, with the sea on both sides, is a highlight of a trip to the shrine.

On Thursdays and Fridays, the shrine is a major pilgrimage site. Irrespective of faith and religion, people visit the dargah to get the blessings of the holy saint. Sometimes, especially on Fridays, various Sufi musicians perform a form of devotional music called &quot;Qawwali&quot; at the dargah.

== &#x27;Haji Ali for all&#x27; movement ==
The &#x27;Haji Ali for all&#x27; is a feminist movement launched by Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan and Bhumata Brigade to secure equal &#x27;right to pray&#x27;, near &quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; (or traditional patriarchal prohibited areas). On 26 August 2016, the Bombay High Court ruled that women could enter the &quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot;. Women were allowed to enter the shrine on 29 November 2016, lifting a ban imposed in June 2012.

==Popular culture==
* &quot;Piya Haji Ali&quot; song, from movie Fiza, was filmed in the dargah.
* &quot;Mumbai Meri Jaan&quot;, a 2008 Indian film, set a scene in the dargah.
* The climax of the super hit Hindi movie &quot;Coolie&quot; (1983) was shot in the dargah.
* There are several references to the mosque in &quot;Shantaram&quot;, the 2003 novel by Gregory David Roberts.

<text>A petrifying well is a well or other body of water which gives objects a stone-like appearance. If an object is placed into such a well and left there for a period of months or years, the object acquires a stony exterior.

==Nature==
If an object is placed into such a well and left there for a period of weeks or months the object acquires a stony exterior. At one time this property was believed to be a result of magic or witchcraft, but it is an entirely natural phenomenon and due to a process of evaporation and deposition in waters with an unusually high mineral content.

This process of petrifying is not to be confused with petrification, wherein the constituent molecules of the original object are replaced (and not merely overlaid) with molecules of stone or mineral.

==Examples==

Notable examples of petrifying wells in England are the spring at Mother Shipton&#x27;s Cave in Knaresborough and Matlock Bath, in Derbyshire. In Ireland, such wells were noted by John Rutty on Howth Head, among other locations.

<text>Trzaska is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
During a battle around the turn of the eleventh century, enemy forces rushed towards King Boleslaw I The Brave of Poland. One of the King&#x27;s knights rushed to the aid of the king, but as he struck the enemy his sword broke near hilt. The King gave the knight his sword, with which the knight fought off the enemy, but near the end of the fight, that sword too broke near the hilt. After the battle, the knight returned the sword to King Boleslaw. For his courage, the knight received a shield from the King exhibiting two broken swords and a crescent moon.

The house name Trzaska (root word Polish: &quot;trzaskać&quot;. Trzaska literally means, he who hits hard or slams. The name was given to the knight after the king noticed the powerful blows that broke both the knight&#x27;s swords and the enemies shields.

The King also gave the knight a monastery in Lublin, where members of the knight&#x27;s house ruled the abbots for three generations. The monastery to this day uses the Trzaska shields as its seal. The alternate names for Trzaska (Lubiewa and Lubiewo) are derived from the name of Lublin, a city in Lesser Poland.

==Blazon==
&quot;&quot;Azure&quot;, two swords &quot;Argent&quot; in pale hilted and pommeled &quot;Or&quot;, conjoined at the blade&#x27;s midpoint and debruised of a crescent at a fess point, also &quot;Or&quot;. For a crest, a panache of peacock plumes, all proper, charged with the arms of the shield.&quot;
There is a new moon, as it were, not full, with both ends upward, yellow in a blue field, and two chipped sword pommels with crosses and hilts, of which one is in the middle of the moon, and the other beneath it. On a helmet above a crown is a peacock&#x27;s tail, with the same moon and pommels.

Note:
That is how Paprocki described it in his &quot;Gniazdo cnoty&quot; (Nest of Virtue), pages 45 and 1187, and in &quot;O herbach&quot; (Of Clan Shields), page 265; also Okolski in vol.3, page 240, and in &quot;Klejnoty&quot; (Crests), page 87.

==Notable bearers==
Notable bearers of this coat of arms include: 
* Agenor Gołuchowski (father)

<text>Kosmos 133 (, meaning &quot;Kosmos 133&quot;), Soyuz 7K-OK No.2, was the first uncrewed test flight of the Soyuz spacecraft, and first mission of the Soyuz programme, as part of the Soviet space programme.

== Launch ==
Launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome aboard the maiden flight of the Soyuz 11A511 s/n U15000-02 launch vehicle. Kosmos 133 was planned &quot;all up&quot; test, to include an automated docking with a second Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz 7K-OK No.1), which was scheduled for launch the day after Kosmos 133.

== Mission ==
Kosmos 133 was operated in a low Earth orbit, on 28 November 1966, it had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 51.9°, and an orbital period of 88.4 minutes.

== Return ==
Problems found during ground testing of the second spacecraft resulted in its launch being delayed, and it was destroyed when its launch vehicle exploded on its launch pad following a scrubbed launch attempt in December 1966. Before this, the attitude control system (ACS) of Kosmos 133 malfunctioned, resulting in rapid consumption of orientation fuel, leaving it spinning at 2 rpm. After large efforts by ground control and 5 attempts at retrofire over two days, the craft was finally coming down for a landing. Due to the inaccuracy of the reentry burn, it was determined that the capsule would land in China. The self-destruct command was given and the satellite exploded 30 November 1966 at 10:21 GMT.

The fireball passed over west Japan and was recorded by photos and a sketch. Kōichirō Tomita identified that it was the Kosmos 133 spacecraft (30 November 1966).

<text>The Ford Motor Company is an American car manufacturing company. It manufactures its own automobile transmissions and only purchases from suppliers in individual cases. They may be used in passenger cars and SUVs, or light commercial vehicles such as vans and light trucks.

Basically there are two types of motor vehicle transmissions:
* Manual – the driver has to perform each gear change using a manually operated clutch
* Automatic – once placed in drive (or any other &#x27;automatic&#x27; selector position), it automatically selects the gear ratio dependent on engine speed and load

Basically there are two types of engine installation:
* In the longitudinal direction, the gearbox is usually designed separately from the final drive (including the differential). The transaxle configuration combines the gearbox and final drive in one housing and is only built in individual cases
* In the transverse direction, the gearbox and final drive are very often combined in one housing due to the much more restricted space available

Every type of transmission occurs in every type of installation.

<text>Rudolf Benesh (16 January 1916 – 3 May 1975) was a British mathematician who created the &quot;Benesh Movement Notation&quot; for dancing.

==Biography==
Rudolf Benesh was son of a Czech father and an Anglo-Italian mother. He worked as a mathematician while his wife Joan was a dancer in Sadler&#x27;s Wells ballet in the late 1940s. She was having difficulty with her attempts to write and then decipher dance steps. He then devised a dance notation system while at work in the office. He wrote some lines to represent a movement of someone at a desk, then asked someone else to decipher them. The system evolved in the period 1947 to 1955. Dame Ninette de Valois announced that the Royal Opera House would be using the Benesh Movement Notation. In the following year, Rudolf and Joan wrote &quot;An Introduction to Benesh Dance Notation&quot;.

In 1957 the first dance notated with the system was Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petroushka&quot;. Faith Worth was the first professional Benesh notator. In 1962 the Benesh Institute of Choreology was established. In 1968 some dances of the Australian Aboriginal dancers of Northern Territory were notated by a group of anthropology students. Joan and Rudolf also wrote &quot;Reading Dance: The Birth of Choreology&quot;. The Royal Academy of Dance, in conjunction with the University of Surrey, produced software in the 1990s for inputting the notation and printing it out.

<text>Topór (Polish for &quot;axe&quot;) is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) families in medieval Poland and under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
The topór coat of arms is one of the oldest &quot;szlachta&quot; armorial bearings, found on a wax seal dated to 1282. Before the Union of Horodło in 1413, it&#x27;s believed approximately 220 Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; families in and around Kraków, Lublin and Sandomierz used these arms.

Under the Union of Horodło the coat of arms was represented by Maciej z Wąsosza, the Voivod of Kraków, and by Jan Butrym, a Lithuanian boyar. After the Union of Horodło the topór coat of arms was transported to Lithuania and adopted by Jan Butrym. Due to its antiquity it was sometimes referred to as &quot;Starża&quot;, an Old-Polish word meaning &quot;old age&quot;.

==Blazon==
Gules an axe proper. For a crest, issuant from a ducal coronet an axe proper in bend.

<text>Jesse Francis McComas (June 9, 1911 – April 19, 1978) was an American science fiction editor. McComas wrote several stories on his own in the 1950s using both his own name and the pseudonym Webb Marlowe.

He entered publishing in 1941 as a salesman and editorial representative, spending two years in New York with Random House. He returned to California in 1944, working as the Pacific Coast editorial representative for Henry Holt and Company. For Simon &amp; Schuster he became their Northern California sales manager and general editorial representative.

McComas was the co-editor, with Raymond J. Healy, of one of the first major American anthologies of science fiction, &quot;Adventures in Time and Space&quot; (1946). Within a few years, he was the co-founding editor, with Anthony Boucher, of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. He edited the magazine from its inception in 1949 as &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy&quot;. In the fall of 1954 he left the magazine as an active editor but continued in the role of advisory editor until 1962.

During the 1950s, McComas reviewed science fiction for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

He left to the San Francisco Public Library his collection of 3,000 volumes of fiction and 92 science fiction magazines dating from the 1920s.

<text>Southend Central railway station is on the London, Tilbury and Southend line and is one of two primary stations serving the city of Southend-on-Sea, Essex. The city&#x27;s other main station is called which is the terminus of a branch line off the Great Eastern Main Line. Southend Central is down the line from London Fenchurch Street via and it is situated between and stations. Its three-letter station code is SOC.

It was opened in 1856 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway and was the eastern terminus of the line until 1888, after which the line was later extended to . The station and all trains serving it are currently operated by c2c.

==Description==
Southend Central has four platforms:
*Platform 1 is a bay platform; trains may terminate at this formerly disused platform if platform 4 is not available for use or when engineering works are taking place between Southend Central and Shoeburyness; it has an operational length for 12-coach trains.
*Platform 2 is typically for eastbound services to ; it has an operational length for 12-coach trains.
*Platform 3 is typically for westbound services to London Fenchurch Street via ; it has an operational length for 14-coach trains.
*Platform 4 is a bay platform typically for westbound services to London Fenchurch Street via either or ; it has an operational length for 12-coach trains.

In 1922 there were two other bay platforms and carriage sidings to the south of platform 4 and a goods shed and goods sidings to the north of platform 1. The bay platforms (5 and 6) were extant in 1981 although the track had been lifted. The area was subsequently redeveloped as a car park.

Facilities at the station include a partially sheltered bicycle storage rack and a car park. The ticket office has two serving positions, one of which is fully accessible, and uses the Tribute ticket issuing system.

Following the successful refurbishment of Benfleet railway station, c2c implemented a similar project at Southend Central. The work cost £460,000 and was jointly funded by c2c and Southend Borough Council. It involved the complete refurbishment of the ticket office and toilets and the construction of a new forecourt on the north side of the station (leading to platform 2) opposite the University of Essex Southend campus, with new steps and handrails on both sides of the canopy, and a new glass roof and lighting over the bicycle parking area. It was completed in 2007 after around four weeks of work.

When the London Underground&#x27;s District line operated a seasonal non-stop excursion train service between 1910 and 1939 through to the Southend area, Southend Central was the second station to be called at after departing .

There was formerly a through siding, provided with overhead line electrification, to the north of the down (Shoeburyness-bound) line between Southend Central and Southend East. This was still in use in 1969.

== Services ==
As of the June 2024 timetable the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
* 4 tph (trains per hour) westbound to London Fenchurch Street via Basildon (2 tph all stations and 2 tph semi-fast)
* 2 tph westbound to London Fenchurch Street via Tilbury Town and Ockendon
* 4 tph eastbound to .

<text>A Darwin machine (a 1987 coinage by William H. Calvin, by analogy to a Turing machine) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an iteration process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses logic, the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, selection, and inheritance.
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any process that bootstraps quality by using all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process: A &quot;pattern&quot; is &quot;copied&quot; with &quot;variations&quot;, where populations of one variant pattern &quot;compete&quot; with another population, their relative success biased by a &quot;multifaceted environment&quot; (natural selection) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin&#x27;s &quot;inheritance principle&quot;).

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that uses some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically natural selection to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in neural Darwinism. Many aspects of neural development use overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

&quot;Darwin machine&quot; has been used multiple times to name computer programs after Charles Darwin.

<text>Hamilton Township is one of the eleven townships of Warren County, Ohio, United States. It is located in the south central portion of the county. The population was 30,587 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Located in the southern part of the county, it borders the following townships:
*Union Township - north
*Salem Township - northeast
*Harlan Township - east
*Goshen Township, Clermont County - southeast
*Miami Township, Clermont County - southwest, south of Symmes Township
*Symmes Township, Hamilton County - southwest, north of Miami Township
*Deerfield Township - west

The village of Maineville is near the center of the township. Parts of the township have been annexed by South Lebanon in the north and Loveland in the south. The communities of Zoar, Cozaddale, Murdock, Hopkinsville, Dallasburg, and Fosters are located here.

==History==
Hamilton Township was one of the four original townships of Warren County, created on May 10, 1803. It is named for Alexander Hamilton, as are similar townships, in Franklin, Jackson, and Lawrence counties statewide.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Public services==
Most of the township is in the Little Miami Local School District, but parts are in the Loveland City, Kings Local, and Goshen Local School Districts. The township is primarily served by the Little Miami and South Lebanon telephone exchanges, but parts lie in the Morrow and Butlerville exchanges. Mail is delivered through the Maineville, Loveland, Goshen, South Lebanon, and Morrow post offices.

==Transportation==
The major roads are US Route 22/Ohio 3, also known as the 3C Highway and originally known as the Cincinnati, Montgomery, and Hopkinsville pike. The Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad, which was absorbed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, ran through the southeast corner of the township, while the Little Miami Railroad followed the Little Miami River through the township. This is now the Little Miami Bike Trail.

<doc id="1065261" wikidata="Q1932925" url="?curid=1065261" title="Loyalty business model">
<text>The loyalty business model is a business model used in strategic management in which a company&#x27;s resources are employed so as to increase the loyalty of customers and other stakeholders in the expectation that corporate objectives will be met or surpassed. A typical example of this type of model is where quality of product or service leads to customer satisfaction, which leads to customer loyalty, which leads to profitability.

==The service quality model==

A model by Kaj Storbacka, Tore Strandvik, and Christian Grönroos (1994), the service quality model, is more detailed than the basic loyalty business model but arrives at the same conclusion. In it, customer satisfaction is first based on a recent experience of the product or service. This assessment depends on prior expectations of overall quality compared to the actual performance received. If the recent experience exceeds prior expectations, customer satisfaction is likely to be high. Customer satisfaction can also be high even with mediocre performance quality if the customer&#x27;s expectations are low, or if the performance provides value (that is, it is priced low to reflect the mediocre quality). Likewise, a customer can be dissatisfied with the service encounter and still perceive the overall quality to be good. This occurs when a quality service is priced very high and the transaction provides little value.

This loyalty business model then looks at the strength of the business relationship; it proposes that this strength is determined by the level of satisfaction with recent experience, overall perceptions of quality, customer commitment to the relationship, and bonds between the parties. Customers are said to have a &quot;zone of tolerance&quot; corresponding to a range of service quality between &quot;barely adequate&quot; and &quot;exceptional&quot;. A single disappointing experience may not significantly reduce the strength of the business relationship if the customer&#x27;s overall perception of quality remains high, if switching costs are high, if there are few satisfactory alternatives, if they are committed to the relationship, and if there are bonds keeping them in the relationship. The existence of these bonds acts as an exit barrier. There are several types of bonds, including: legal bonds (contracts), technological bonds (shared technology), economic bonds (dependence), knowledge bonds, social bonds, cultural or ethnic bonds, ideological bonds, psychological bonds, geographical bonds, time bonds, and planning bonds.

This model then examines the link between relationship strength and customer loyalty. Customer loyalty is determined by three factors: relationship strength, perceived alternatives and critical episodes. The relationship can terminate if:
# the customer moves away from the company&#x27;s service area,
# the customer no longer has a need for the company&#x27;s products or services,
# more suitable alternative providers become available,
# the relationship strength has weakened,
# the company handles a critical episode poorly,
# unexplainable change of price of the service provided.

The final link in the model is the effect of customer loyalty on profitability. The fundamental assumption of all the loyalty models is that keeping existing customers is less expensive than acquiring new ones. It is claimed by Reichheld and Sasser (1990) that a 5% improvement in customer retention can cause an increase in profitability between 25% and 85% (in terms of net present value) depending upon the industry. However, Carrol and Reichheld (1992) dispute these calculations, claiming that they result from faulty cross-sectional analysis.

According to Buchanan and Gilles (1990), the increased profitability associated with customer retention efforts occurs because:
* The cost of acquisition occurs only at the beginning of a relationship: the longer the relationship, the lower the amortized cost.
* Account maintenance costs decline as a percentage of total costs (or as a percentage of revenue).
* Long term customers tend to be less inclined to switch and also tend to be less price sensitive. This can result in stable unit sales volume and increases in sales volume.
* Long term customers may initiate free word of mouth promotions and referrals.
* Long term customers are more likely to purchase ancillary products and high-margin supplemental products.
* Long term customers tend to be satisfied with their relationship with the company and are less likely to switch to competitors, making market entry or competitors&#x27; market share gains difficult.
* Regular customers tend to be less expensive to service because they are familiar with the processes involved, require less &quot;education,&quot; and are consistent in their order placement.
* Increased customer retention and loyalty makes the employees&#x27; jobs easier and more satisfying. In turn, happy employees feed back into higher customer satisfaction in a virtuous circle.

For this final link to hold, the relationship must be profitable. Striving to maintain the loyalty of unprofitable customers is not a viable business model. That is why it is important for marketers to assess the profitability of each of its clients (or types of clients), and terminate those relationships that are not profitable. In order to do this, each customer&#x27;s &quot;relationship costs&quot; are compared to their &quot;relationship revenue&quot;. A useful calculation for this is the patronage concentration ratio. This calculation is hindered by the difficulty in allocating costs to individual relationships and the ambiguity regarding relationship cost drivers.

==Expanded models==
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Virtuous Circle&quot;
Schlesinger and Heskett (1991) added &quot;employee loyalty&quot; to the basic customer loyalty model. They developed the concepts of &quot;cycle of success&quot; and &quot;cycle of failure&quot;. In the cycle of success, an investment in your employees’ ability to provide superior service to customers can be seen as a &quot;virtuous circle&quot;. Effort spent in selecting and training employees and creating a corporate culture in which they are empowered can lead to increased employee satisfaction and employee competence. This will likely result in superior service delivery and customer satisfaction. This in turn can create customer loyalty, improved sales levels, and higher profit margins. Some of these profits can be reinvested in employee development thereby initiating another iteration of a virtuous cycle.

Fred Reichheld (1996) expanded the loyalty business model beyond customers and employees. He looked at the benefits of obtaining the loyalty of suppliers, employees, bankers, customers, distributors, shareholders, and the board of directors.

Duff and Einig (2015) expanded the model to debt issuers and credit ratings agencies to investigate what role commitment plays in issuer-CRA relations.

== Satisfaction-profit-chain (SPC) model==
The satisfaction-profit chain is a model that theoretically develops linkages and then enables researchers to test them statistically for a firm using customer data (both from surveys and other sources). The satisfaction-profit-chain was tested in the context of banking industry showing that product and services improvements indeed were associated with customer perceptions, which led to beneficial customer behaviors such as repurchase, and desirable financial outcomes such as increased sales and profitability The satisfaction-profit-chain, as a methodology for managing customer loyalty and firm profitability, is also applicable in business-to-business markets, irrespective of whether the B2B firm sells goods and/or services.

The satisfaction-profit-chain refers to a chain of effects whereby increased performance on key attributes leads to improvements in overall satisfaction, which in turn affects loyalty intentions and behaviors. The increased customer loyalty is shown to affect short- and long-term financial outcomes including sales, profitability, and stock price. More recently, some studies show that especially in the context of services such as retailing and financial services, employee satisfaction can play a critical role in enhancing customer loyalty. This happens because both customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction can mutually reinforce each other, and promote stronger customer loyalty. More specifically, for a given level of overall satisfaction, customer loyalty is disproportionately stronger when customers perceive that employees are also satisfied.

The SPC model has become the basis of a large body of empirical research showing the strong impact of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty. Research has clearly shown that one of the best ways to increase customer loyalty—measured as repurchase intentions and/or repurchase behavior—is by increasing customer satisfaction (more satisfied customers are more loyal, in general). Though the relationship is positive, research shows there are many differences:

1) The effect of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty can vary based on customer demographics and segments, such that it is stronger for some demographic groups and segments than others.

2) The effect of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and subsequent financial outcomes for firms, can vary based on industry. Specifically, factors such as—goods versus services industry, degree of competition or concentration in the industry, the utilitarian or hedonic nature of products, and customers&#x27; switching costs can affect the nature (non-linearity) and strength of the link between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.

3) The measurement of loyalty—especially for customers is multi-faceted. Customer loyalty includes a variety of outcomes—intentions and behaviors associated with repurchase including word-of-mouth, complaint behaviors, share-of-wallet or the relative proportion of purchasing from a single firm relative to customer&#x27;s total purchasing, and likelihood to recommend.

4) Customer loyalty is influenced, not only by customer satisfaction but also employee satisfaction. Customer loyalty is a function of customer satisfaction. In many firms, especially service-oriented industries such as retailing, health-care, financial services, education, and hospitality the level of satisfaction experienced by front-line employees is a critical component. The level of employee satisfaction influences customer satisfaction as shown in a large-scale study of managers, front-line employees, and customers of a DIY retailer in Europe: results showed that managers affected overall job-satisfaction of front-line employees, which in turn affected the satisfaction of customers they interacted with. Most surprisingly, the level of customer loyalty was much higher among those customers who were themselves more satisfied, but also interacted with more satisfied employees. Highly satisfied customers who dealt with relatively less satisfied employees were relatively less loyal.

== Commitment-loyalty model==
The customer commitment approach to loyalty is based on the idea that customers with higher commitment toward the brand are also more likely to be loyal toward the brand. Earlier models of customer commitment conceptualized it as a unidimensional construct (e.g., Garbarino and Johnson 1999; Moorman et al. 1992). More recently, scholars have developed a five dimensional scale to measure customer commitment and relate it to customer loyalty. The five commitment dimensions include:
* Affective commitment
* Normative commitment
* Economic commitment
* Forced commitment
* Habitual commitment

==Data collection==
Typically, loyalty data is being collected by multi-item measurement scales administered in questionnaires by software providers such as Confirmit, Medallia, and Satmetrix. However, other approaches sometimes seem more viable if managers want to know the extent of loyalty for an entire data warehouse. This approach is described in Buckinx, Verstraeten &amp; Van den Poel (2006).

All historical trends for different segmentations and their standard of living may also be very helpful in developing customer retention strategy. Lifestyle is also a very powerful tool, can be used for better customer retention and to know his/her needs in better way.

<text>The Plaza Hotel (also known as The Plaza) is a luxury hotel and condominium apartment building in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It is located on the western side of Grand Army Plaza, after which it is named, just west of Fifth Avenue, and is between 58th Street and Central Park South ( 59th Street), at the southeastern corner of Central Park. Its primary address is 768 Fifth Avenue, though the residential entrance is One Central Park South. Since 2018, the hotel has been owned by the Qatari firm Katara Hospitality.

The 18-story, French Renaissance-inspired château style building was designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. The facade is made of marble at the base, with white brick covering the upper stories, and is topped by a mansard roof. The ground floor contains the two primary lobbies, as well as a corridor connecting the large ground-floor restaurant spaces, including the Oak Room, the Oak Bar, the Edwardian Room, the Palm Court, and the Terrace Room. The upper stories contain the ballroom and a variety of residential condominiums, condo-hotel suites, and short-term hotel suites. At its peak, the Plaza Hotel had over 800 rooms. Following a renovation in 2008, the building has 282 hotel rooms and 181 condos.

A hotel of the same name was built from 1883 to 1890. The original hotel was replaced by the current structure from 1905 to 1907; Warren and Wetmore designed an expansion to the Plaza Hotel that was added from 1919 to 1921, and several major renovations were conducted through the rest of the 20th century. The Plaza Operating Company, which erected the current building, operated the hotel until 1943. Subsequently, it was sold to several owners during the remainder of the 20th century, including Conrad Hilton, A.M. Sonnabend, Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts, Donald Trump, and a partnership of City Developments Limited and Al-Waleed bin Talal. The Plaza Hotel was renovated again after El Ad Properties purchased it in 2005, and the hotel was subsequently sold to Sahara India Pariwar in 2012 and then to Katara Hospitality in 2018. The hotel has been managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts since 2005.

Since its inception, the Plaza Hotel has become an icon of New York City, with numerous wealthy and famous guests. The restaurant spaces and ballrooms have hosted events such as balls, benefits, weddings, and press conferences. The hotel&#x27;s design, as well as its location near Central Park, has generally received acclaim. In addition, the Plaza Hotel has appeared in numerous books and films. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the hotel&#x27;s exterior and some of its interior spaces as city landmarks, and the building is also a National Historic Landmark. The hotel is also a member of Historic Hotels of America.

==Site==
The Plaza Hotel is at 768 Fifth Avenue and One Central Park South in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It faces Central Park South (59th Street) and the Pond and Hallett Nature Sanctuary in Central Park to the north; Grand Army Plaza to the east; and 58th Street to the south. Fifth Avenue itself is across Grand Army Plaza from the hotel. The hotel&#x27;s site covers . It measures along 58th Street and along Central Park South, with a depth of between the two streets. As completed in 1907, it measured along 58th Street and along Central Park South, with an &quot;L&quot; running the entire 200-foot depth of the lot along Grand Army Plaza.

The hotel is near the General Motors Building to the east; the Park Lane Hotel to the west; and the Solow Building, Paris Theater, and Bergdorf Goodman Building to the south. The hotel&#x27;s main entrance faces the Pulitzer Fountain in the southern portion of Grand Army Plaza. An entrance to the Fifth Avenue–59th Street station of the New York City Subway&#x27;s is within the base of the hotel at Central Park South.

Fifth Avenue between 42nd Street and Central Park South was relatively undeveloped throughout the late 19th century, when brownstone rowhouses were built on the avenue. By the early 1900s, that section of Fifth Avenue was becoming commercialized. The first decade of the 20th century saw the construction of hotels, stores, and clubs such as the St. Regis New York, the University Club of New York, and the Gotham Hotel. The corner of Fifth Avenue, Central Park South, and 59th Street was developed with the Plaza, Savoy, and New Netherland hotels during the 1890s; the Savoy would be replaced in 1927 by the Savoy-Plaza Hotel, which itself would be demolished in 1964. All three hotels contributed to Fifth Avenue&#x27;s importance as an upscale area.

== Architecture ==
The Plaza Hotel, a French Renaissance-inspired château-style building, is tall, with 18 stories. The hotel&#x27;s floors are numbered according to European usage, where floor 1, corresponding to the second story, is directly above the ground floor. The building was designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in 1907, with a later addition, by Warren and Wetmore, being built from 1919 to 1922. The interiors of the main public spaces were primarily designed by Hardenbergh, Warren and Wetmore, and Schultze &amp; Weaver. The other interior spaces were by Annabelle Selldorf and date largely to a renovation in 2008. Numerous contractors were involved in the construction of the hotel, including the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company and brick contractor Pfotenhauer &amp; Nesbit.

=== Facade ===
The detail of the facade is concentrated on its two primary elevations, which face north toward Central Park and east toward Fifth Avenue. The facade&#x27;s articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and crown. The northern and eastern elevations are also split vertically into three portions, with the center portion being recessed. The northeastern and southeastern corners of the hotel contain rounded corners, which resemble turrets. There are numerous loggias, balustrades, columns, pilasters, balconies, and arches repeated across various parts of the facade. The 1921 annex contains a design that is largely similar to Hardenbergh&#x27;s 1907 design.

==== Base ====
The first and second stories of the facade, respectively corresponding to the ground floor and floor 1 of the interior, are clad with rusticated blocks of marble. The third story, corresponding to floor 2 of the interior, contains a smooth marble surface. The hotel had two guest entrances in the 1907 design: the main entrance on Central Park South and a private entrance for long-term residents on 58th Street. The main entrance, in the center of the Central Park South facade, contains a porch above the three center bays, and large doorways. Since the hotel&#x27;s 2008 renovation, the Central Park South entrance has served as the entrance to the building&#x27;s condominiums.

The Grand Army Plaza side originally contained a terrace called the Champagne Porch. There were three minor entrances, including one to the porch. The Champagne Porch was replaced by a large central entry in 1921. The entrance there consists of six Tuscan-style columns, supporting a balcony on the second story, immediately above ground level. The second and third stories at the center of the Grand Army Plaza facade contains paired Corinthian-style pilasters supporting an entablature.

==== Upper stories ====
The fourth through fifteenth stories, respectively corresponding to interior floors 3 through 14, are clad with white brick and typically contain rectangular windows. These stories contain terracotta veneers that harmonize with the marble facade below it and the mansard roof above. At the center of the Central Park South facade, the five center bays at the twelfth and thirteenth stories (floors 11 and 12) contain an arcade composed of arches with paired pilasters. On the Grand Army Plaza side, there are horizontal band courses above the thirteenth story. The 58th Street facade is a scaled-down version of the two primary elevations on Central Park South and Grand Army Plaza. A marble balcony runs above the thirteenth story on all sides.

The top three floors are within a green-tile mansard roof with copper trim. The Grand Army Plaza side contains a gable, while the 58th Street and Central Park South sides have three stories of dormer windows. The turrets on the northeastern and southeastern corners are topped by domed roofs, which are painted green to match the color of the trees in Central Park. A penthouse occupies the top three stories, which are labeled as floors 19–21.

=== Mechanical features ===
The hotel originally contained three sets of pneumatic tube mail systems: one for guest mail, another for guests to order food from the kitchen, and a third for the hotel&#x27;s various operating departments. The hotel also originally had 10 passenger elevators, 13 dumbwaiters, and three sidewalk elevators. These elevators included four at the Central Park South lobby, three at the 58th Street lobby, and two near Central Park South, for long-term residents. The hotel&#x27;s water storage tanks had a capacity of , and the hotel could filter of water from the New York City water supply system each day. Water was passed through ten filters before it was pumped to rooms, and water for the kitchens and for drinking fountains passed through additional filters.

The mechanical plant in the subbasement originally contained nine boilers; a coal plant with a capacity of ; fourteen ventilating fans; and an electric generating plant with a capacity of . Also in the subbasement was a refrigerating plant that could make of ice every 24 hours, as well as a switchboard made of Tennessee marble, which controlled the hotel&#x27;s power and lighting.

=== Interior ===
The hotel has a steel frame superstructure with hollow tile floors, as well as wired-glass enclosures around all stairways and elevators. Originally, five marble staircases led from the ground floor to all of the other floors. As constructed, the stories above the ground floor surrounded a large courtyard, which was covered over with office space in a 1940s renovation. Hardenbergh, in designing the Central Park South foyer, had believed the lobby to be the most important space in the hotel, as did Warren and Wetmore when they designed the Fifth Avenue lobby. Furthermore, Warren and Wetmore had thought restaurants to be the second most significant space in a hotel, in designing the Terrace Room.

There were originally laundry rooms in the basement and on floor 18. When the hotel opened in 1907, the basement also contained a grill room, kitchen, various refrigeration rooms, and amenities such as a Victorian-style Turkish bath and a barber shop. Originally concealed within the mansard roof were the housekeepers&#x27; quarters and maids&#x27; dormitories; the eighteenth floor had carpentry, ironing, and tailors&#x27; departments. The spaces on floor 18 had become offices by the late 20th century.

==== Hallways and lobbies ====
In Hardenbergh&#x27;s original design, a main corridor connects the primary spaces on the ground floor. The corridor, which still exists, connects the lobbies on 58th Street, Grand Army Plaza, and Central Park South. The layout of the ground-floor hallways dates largely from the 1921 expansion by Warren and Wetmore. The corridor wraps around the south, east, and north sides of the Palm Court, which is in the center of the ground floor. Various smaller corridors lead off the main corridor. All of the halls have floors decorated with mosaics, coffered ceilings made of plaster, and marble columns and pilasters with bronze capitals.

The Central Park South entrance foyer served as the original main lobby, and is in the shape of a &quot;U&quot;, with an overhanging mezzanine. It contains French marble walls, gilded-bronze column capitals, veined Italian-marble finishes, gold-colored trimmings, a mosaic floor, a plaster coffered ceiling, and columns similar to those in the main corridor. There is a bank of four elevators, with decorative bronze doors, directly in front of the entrance. A crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling. The entrance doorways contain bronze frames with lunettes. Originally, the branch offices of major brokerage houses adjoined the foyer, including one office in the modern-day Oak Bar. In total, there were six brokerage houses scattered across the ground floor.

During Warren and Wetmore&#x27;s expansion, the Grand Army Plaza lobby, also called the Fifth Avenue lobby, was created as the hotel&#x27;s new main lobby, which occupied the former Plaza Restaurant&#x27;s space. The lobby contains a U-shaped mezzanine running above the northern, eastern, and southern walls, with three entrance vestibules below the eastern section of the mezzanine. The Fifth Avenue lobby was decorated with bas-reliefs; and it preserved some of the original decorations from the Plaza Restaurant, including paneled pilasters and a beamed ceiling. Other features, including the mosaic floor and a crystal chandelier, were added by Warren and Wetmore.

The 58th Street entrance has three elevators and adjoins what was formerly a women&#x27;s reception room. West of this lobby is a staircase leading up to a mezzanine-level corridor, which has marble floors and ashlar walls and abuts the Terrace Room&#x27;s balcony to the north and a foyer to the south. The mezzanine-level foyer has marble floors, a painted coffered ceiling supported by two square columns, and a bank of two elevators to the ballroom on floor 1. A marble staircase, with a marble and wooden balustrade, leads from the mezzanine foyer to the ballroom level.

The layout of the upper floors was based on the layout of the ground-floor hallways because all the stairways and elevators were placed in the same position on the upper floors. On floor 2 and all subsequent stories, a centrally located C-shaped corridor runs around the north, east, and south sides of the building and connects every room.

==== Ground-floor restaurants ====
The Oak Room, on the western part of the ground floor, was built in 1907 as the bar room. It is west of the Central Park South foyer, separated from the foyer by a corridor. Compared to other spaces in the hotel, it retains more details from the original design. The Oak Room was designed in a German Renaissance style, originally by L. Alavoine and Company. It features oak walls and floors, a coved ceiling, frescoes of Bavarian castles, faux wine casks carved into the woodwork, and a grape-laden brass chandelier. The eastern wall contains a gridded glass double door leading to the main hallway, while the northern wall contains two openings to the Oak Bar.

The Oak Bar is just north of the Oak Room, at the northwest corner of the ground floor. It is designed in Tudor Revival style with a plaster ceiling, strapwork, and floral and foliage motifs. The bar room contains walnut woodwork with French furnishings. It also has three murals by Everett Shinn, which were added in a 1945 renovation and show the neighborhood as it would have appeared in 1907. Prior to the renovation, the Oak Bar served as a brokerage office.

The Edwardian Room, previously known as the Men&#x27;s Grill or Fifth Avenue Cafe, is at the northeast corner of the ground floor and measures . It was originally designed by William Baumgarten &amp; Company and McNulty Brothers, but it has been redecorated multiple times. It contains dark Flemish-oak paneling, high, with finishes and doorway surrounds made of Caen stone. The walls originally had oak wainscoting and an Aubosson tapestry frieze. The floor is inlaid with mosaic tiles, and the beamed ceiling is inlaid with mirrors, giving the impression of highly decorated trusses. The room is lit by large windows and eight large bronze chandeliers. The room&#x27;s original color scheme was a relatively toned-down palette of green, dark brown, and gray hues. When first built, there was a musicians&#x27; balcony overlooking the room. The room also had an entrance at Grand Army Plaza, which was closed with the creation of the Fifth Avenue lobby. The space housed the Green Tulip and Plaza Suite restaurants in the late 20th century; by the 2000s, it was known as One CPS.

The Palm Court, previously known as the tea room, is in the center of the ground floor. Its design was inspired by the Palm Court at the Carlton Hotel in London. The space has Caen stone and Breche Violette walls, mosaic floors, and marble pilasters and columns with bronze capitals. Tropical plants, rubber trees, and palms gave the room a garden-like ambiance. The Palm Court initially had a stained glass ceiling, which was removed in a 1940s renovation; it was restored in the mid-2000s. There were also mirrors on the western wall, against which are four caryatids carved by Pottier &amp; Stymus, which frame the wall mirrors and represent the seasons. The Palm Court was renovated in 2014; its modern design includes four palm trees as well as a central marble-and-brass bar. East of the Palm Court, separated from it by the main corridor, were once the Plaza Restaurant and the Champagne Porch. The Palm Court and Plaza Restaurant, which shared nearly identical designs, originally formed a &quot;vast dining hall&quot;. Removable glass panes along the main corridor abutted both spaces.

The Terrace Room, west of the Palm Court, is part of Warren and Wetmore&#x27;s 1921 design and is named because it contains three terraces. The terrace increases in height from east to west and divide the room into three sections, which are separated by balustrades and connected by small staircases. The space contains Renaissance-style motifs on the pilasters, ceilings, and wall arches, as well as three chandeliers and rusticated-marble walls. John B. Smeraldi was commissioned to paint the Terrace Room&#x27;s ornamentation. The room is surrounded by a balcony, with a painted coffer ceiling possibly commissioned by Smeraldi, as well as marble pilasters and floors. A balcony runs slightly above the room on its southern wall. Immediately south of the balcony is the Terrace Room&#x27;s corridor and foyer.

The southeastern corner of the ground floor originally contained the 58th Street Restaurant, which was exclusively for the hotel&#x27;s long-term residents. In 1934, it was replaced by a nightclub called the Persian Room, which had red and Persian-blue upholstery by Joseph Urban, five wall murals by Lillian Gaertner Palmedo, and a bar. The room operated until 1978.

==== Ballroom ====
The original double-height ballroom from Hardenbergh&#x27;s plan was on the north side of the second story, or floor 1 according to the Plaza Hotel&#x27;s floor numbering system. The old ballroom, with a capacity of 500 to 600 people, was served by its own elevator and staircase, and contained a movable stage. The old ballroom was overlooked on three sides by balconies, and contained a white-and-cream color scheme similar to the current ballroom. It was served by its own entrance on 58th Street. By the 1970s, the old ballroom was replaced by offices.

The current ballroom on floor 1 is at the center of that story. It was initially designed by Warren and Wetmore, and had a capacity of 800 people for dinners and 1,000 people for dances. The room contained a coved ceiling designed by Smeraldi, with crosses, hexagons, and octagons, as well as six chandeliers. The ballroom had a stage on its western wall, within a rectangular opening. A balcony ran across the three other walls and was supported by pilasters with bronze capitals.

In 1929, Warren and Wetmore&#x27;s ballroom was reconstructed according to a neoclassical design by Schultze &amp; Weaver. The room has a white-and-cream color scheme with gold ornamentation, evocative of the original ballroom&#x27;s design. The stage remains on the western wall, but is within a rounded opening. The redesign added audience boxes, with decorative metal railings, on the north and east walls. The ballroom contains a coved ceiling with roundels, lunettes, bas reliefs, and two chandeliers. South of the ballroom proper is a corridor running west to east. The corridor has a decorative barrel-vaulted paneled ceiling and had a balcony that was removed during the 1929 redesign. On the southernmost section of floor 1 is the ballroom foyer and the stair hall, two formerly separate rooms that were combined in 1965 to form a neoclassical marble-clad space. The stair hall contains the stairs leading from the mezzanine foyer.

==== Condominiums and suites ====
The Plaza Hotel&#x27;s condominiums and suites start on the third story, labeled as floor 2. As originally built, they contained three primary types of suites: those with one bedroom and one bathroom; those with two bedrooms and two bathrooms; and those with a parlor and varying numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms. The walls were originally painted in rose, yellow, cream, and gray hues. No wallpaper was used in the rooms, which were instead finished in plain plaster. For decorative effect, the rooms contained wooden wainscoting and furniture, while the plaster ceilings supported crystal chandeliers. A guest or resident could request multiple suites, since there were smaller private hallways adjacent to the main hallway on each floor. There were also staff rooms at the corners of the main corridor on each floor. Dumbwaiters led from the staff rooms to the basement kitchen, allowing guests to order meals and eat them in-suite. In each room were three buttons, which guests could use to contact that floor&#x27;s staff, the maid, or the bellhop.

Following its 2008 renovation, the building contains 181 privately owned condominiums, which are marketed as the Plaza Residences or One Central Park South. The condominiums are on the north and east sides of the building and have a variety of layouts, from studio apartments to three-story penthouse units. The condos&#x27; interiors include parquet floors and stone counters, and largely reflect the original design of these rooms. There are also 282 hotel units on the southern side of the building. Of these, 152 condo-hotel units occupy the eleventh through twenty-first stories, respectively labeled as floors 10 through 20. The condo-hotel units serve as residences for investors or staff for up to four months a year, and are used as short-term hotel units for the remaining time. In addition, there are 130 rooms exclusively for short-term stays on the fourth through tenth stories, respectively labeled as floors 3 through 9. The hotel portion of the building retains a butler on each floor, reminiscent of the hotel&#x27;s original opulence.

Hardenbergh&#x27;s design included the State Apartment on the northern side of floor 1. This apartment was one of the most lavish suites in the entire hotel; it had a drawing room, antechambers, dining rooms, bedrooms and bathrooms, and food storage. Also on floor 1 were private banquet, reception, and card rooms. The apartment was turned into a private dining area and restored in 1974. Similarly ornate suites were located along the Central Park South side on eleven of the upper floors. The twenty-first story (labeled as floor 20) was created as part of the 2008 renovation, and is part of a four-bedroom penthouse, the largest condominium in the building.

In the early- and mid-20th century, several designers, such as Elsie de Wolfe and Cecil Beaton, were hired to design special suites for the hotel, which has also offered suites or experiences that are themed to notable books or films set there. During 2013, a suite on the 18th floor of the hotel was furnished with various decorations from the movie &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The furnished room was based on the novel of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald, which had several scenes set at the hotel (see ). During 2017 and 2018, the Plaza Hotel sold vacation packages with memorabilia, photo opportunities, an in-suite ice cream sundae, and visits to New York City tourist attractions based on the film &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, which is partially set in the hotel. Another room in the hotel was redecorated in 2022 to promote the TV series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;.

== History ==
The land lots making up the site of the present-day Plaza Hotel were first parceled and sold by the government of New York City in 1853, and acquired by John Anderson from 1870 to 1881. Prior to the Plaza Hotel&#x27;s development, the site was occupied either by the New York Skating Club, or was vacant. When John Anderson died in 1881, his will stipulated that his land would pass to his son, John Charles Anderson. The first development on the site was proposed in 1882, when Ernest Flagg was enlisted to design a 12-story apartment building for a syndicate led by his father, Jared. However, the Flagg apartment development was not built, likely due to a lack of funding.

=== First hotel ===
John Duncan Phyfe and James Campbell acquired the site in 1883. Phyfe and Campbell announced plans for a nine-story apartment building at the site in October of that year, to be designed by Carl Pfeiffer; and construction on the apartment block began that same year. The builders borrowed over $800,000 from the New York Life Insurance Company, and obtained a second mortgage from John Charles Anderson for a total investment of $2 million. By 1887, after taking three loans from New York Life, Phyfe and Campbell found that they did not have enough funds to complete the apartment block. The extent to which the apartment building was completed before the builders&#x27; bankruptcy is unclear.

In February 1888, brothers Eugene M. and Frank Earle entered into a contract to lease the hotel from Phyfe and Campbell and to furnish it. New York Life concurrently foreclosed on the apartment building and that September bought it at public auction for $925,000. Shortly afterward, New York Life decided to remodel the interiors completely, hiring architects McKim, Mead &amp; White to complete the hotel. New York Life leased the hotel to Frederick A. Hammond in 1889, and the Hammond brothers became the operators of the hotel for the next fifteen years.

The first Plaza Hotel finally opened on October 1, 1890, at a cost of $3 million. The original hotel stood eight stories tall and had 400 rooms. The interiors featured extensive mahogany and carved-wood furnishings; lion motifs, representing the hotel&#x27;s coat of arms; and a dining room with stained glass windows and gold and white decorations. Moses King, in his 1893 &quot;Handbook of New York City&quot;, characterized the hotel as &quot;one of the most attractive public houses in the wide world&quot;. Despite being described as fashionable, it was not profitable. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1891 that the hotel netted $72,000 in rental income, against the $1.8 million that New York Life had spent to complete the hotel, including loans to Phyfe and Campbell.

=== Redeveloped hotel in the early 20th century ===
The first Plaza Hotel had been relatively remote when it was completed, but by the first decade of the 20th century was part of a rapidly growing commercial district on Fifth Avenue. Furthermore, several upscale hotels in Manhattan were also being rebuilt during that time. In May 1902, a syndicate purchased the Plaza and three adjacent lots on Central Park South for $3 million. The sale was the largest-ever cash-only purchase for a Manhattan property at the time. The purchasers were headed by Harry S. Black—who headed the George A. Fuller Company, one of the syndicate&#x27;s members—as well as German financier Bernhard Beinecke.

Shortly after the purchase, Black and Beinecke formed the Plaza Realty Company to redevelop the hotel. In mid-1905, Black also formed the United States Realty and Construction Company, a trust whose subsidiaries included the Fuller Company and the Plaza Realty Company. Sources disagree on whether Black and Beinecke approached barbed-wire entrepreneur John Warne Gates for funding, or whether Gates overheard Black and Beinecke discuss their redevelopment plans at a restaurant. In either case, Gates agreed to fund the project on the condition that Frederic Sterry be named the Plaza&#x27;s managing director. To entice Sterry to join the hotel&#x27;s staff, Black and Beinecke wanted to make a grand hotel.

==== Construction ====
Henry J. Hardenbergh was hired as architect in 1905, initially being commissioned to expand the existing hotel by five stories. Hardenbergh had already gained some renown for designing other upscale hotels, such as the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, twenty-five blocks south, during the 1890s. Beinecke, Black, and Gates subsequently discovered that the foundation of the existing hotel could not support the additional stories, so they decided to rebuild it completely. The George A. Fuller Company was contracted to construct the new hotel. Hardenbergh designed the new hotel building while the owners waited for the existing lease to expire. His design took advantage of the fact that the site faced Grand Army Plaza and could thus be seen from many angles.

The first Plaza Hotel was closed on June 11, 1905, and demolition commenced immediately upon the expiration of the lease there. The existing hotel&#x27;s furnishings were auctioned. The site was cleared within two months of the start of demolition. Hardenbergh filed plans for the hotel with the New York City Department of Buildings that September. By the next month, contractors were clearing the old hotel&#x27;s foundation. The new hotel was to use of steel, and a group of 100 workers and seven derricks erected two stories of steelwork every six days. The Fuller Company decided to hire both union and non-union ironworkers for the hotel&#x27;s construction, a decision that angered the union workers. Patrolmen were hired to protect the non-union workers, and one patrolmen was killed during a dispute with union workers. By October 1906, the facade of the new hotel was under construction.

Hardenbergh and Sterry directed several firms to furnish the interior spaces. Sterry recalled that all of the interior features were custom-designed for the hotel, such as 1,650 crystal chandeliers and the largest-ever order of gold-rimmed cutlery. Much of the furniture was manufactured by the Pooley Company of Philadelphia; where the Pooley Company could not manufacture the furnishings, the Plaza&#x27;s developers chartered ships to import material from Europe. Sterry himself was dispatched to Europe to purchase these materials. The developers originally anticipated that the hotel would cost $8.5 million to construct, including the furnishings. Shortly after work started, the developers determined that they would need to raise another $4 million, and the additional expenditures pushed the final construction cost to $12.5 million. To pay for the construction costs, the developers received a $5 million loan in mid-1906, followed by another $4.5 million loan in 1907.

==== Opening and expansion ====

The new 800-room Plaza Hotel was opened on October 1, 1907, twenty-seven months after work had commenced. The opening was attended by people such as businessman Diamond Jim Brady; actresses Lillian Russell, Billie Burke, Maxine Elliott, and Fritzi Scheff; producers David Belasco and Oscar Hammerstein I; actor John Drew Jr.; and author Mark Twain. Though the opening coincided with the Panic of 1907, the hotel suffered minimal losses. The new hotel more than doubled the capacity of the first structure, and it was intended as a largely residential hotel at opening, although the terms for &quot;hotel&quot; and &quot;apartment&quot; were largely synonymous at the time. Estimates held that ninety percent of the units were for long-term residents. The owners charged short-term guests $2.50 nightly. In addition to the apartments, there were 500 bathrooms, ten elevators, a myriad of marble staircases, and two floors of public rooms. Gates, one of the original investors, was among the residents of the new Plaza; when he died in 1911, his funeral was held at the hotel.

Most of the public rooms were not originally given formal names. Although Hardenbergh had predicted that gender-segregated spaces were going out of fashion, there was a women&#x27;s reception room near 58th Street; and the bar room and men&#x27;s grill (respectively the present Oak and Edwardian Rooms) were exclusively used by men. In practice, the men&#x27;s grill acted as a social club where discussing business was socially inappropriate, while the bar was a space to talk business. Sometime between 1912 and the start of Prohibition in the United States in 1920, the brokerage office near the entrance, now the Oak Bar, was turned into an extension of the bar room. The Champagne Porch along Grand Army Plaza was the most exclusive area of the hotel, with meals costing between $50 and $500. The basement&#x27;s grill room hosted ice-skating in the summer, as well as a &quot;dog check room&quot; where residents&#x27; dogs could be fed luxuriously. In its first decade, the Plaza employed a staff of over 1,500.

From the start, the Plaza Operating Company was already preparing for the possibility of expansion, and it acquired the lots between 5 and 19 West 58th Street in the first two decades of the 20th century. This land acquisition commenced before the second hotel had even opened. By 1915, the Plaza Operating Company had acquired four lots on West 58th Street and one on Central Park South, and it received an exemption from the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which set height restrictions for new buildings on the 58th Street side of the lots. The company filed plans for a 19-story annex along 58th Street in August 1919, to be designed by Warren and Wetmore. The final lots, at 15 and 17 West 58th Street, were acquired in 1920 after the plans had been filed. The George A. Fuller Company was again hired as the builder. To fund the construction of the annex, the Plaza Operating Company took out mortgage loans worth $2.275 million.

The Champagne Porch was only frequented by the extremely wealthy; and in 1921, after the start of Prohibition, Sterry decided to remove the room altogether. An enlarged entrance took its place. The work also included building a new restaurant called the Terrace Room, as well as a ballroom and 350 additional suites. Warren and Wetmore designed the expanded interior with more subtle contrasts in the decor, compared to Hardenbergh&#x27;s design. The annex opened October 14, 1921, with an event in the ballroom, but was not officially completed until April 1922. With the advent of Prohibition, the bar room was also closed, and the gender segregation rule was relaxed. The space occupied by the present-day Oak Bar became the offices of brokerage EF Hutton. The Plaza had become the city&#x27;s most valuable hotel by 1923, and contributed to the parent U.S. Realty Company being highly profitable and paying increasingly high dividends during the 1920s.

==== Great Depression ====
For unknown reasons, Warren and Wetmore&#x27;s ballroom was reconstructed from June to September 1929, based on neoclassical designs by Schultze &amp; Weaver. Shortly afterward, U.S. Realty&#x27;s stock price collapsed in the Wall Street Crash of October 1929, which commenced the Great Depression in the United States. Plaza Hotel co-owner Harry Black killed himself the following year, and his partner Bernhard Beinecke died two years later. The rebuilt Plaza&#x27;s first manager, Fred Sterry, died in 1933. The early 1930s were also financially difficult for the Plaza Hotel, as only half of the suites were occupied by 1932. To reduce operating costs for the hotel&#x27;s restaurants, the grill room in the basement was converted into a closet, while the Rose Room became an automobile showroom. The furnishings of the hotel fell into disrepair; and during some months management was unable to pay staff.

By the mid-1930s, the old tea room was officially known as the Palm Court, having been frequently referred to as the &quot;Palm Room&quot; during the previous decade. The back room was reopened as the Oak Room restaurant in 1934, although it was still referred to as the &quot;back room&quot; by its frequent visitors, which included bankers and brokers. The same year, the Fifth Avenue lobby received display windows and a doorway on the southern wall; and the southeastern corner of the ground floor was remodeled into the Persian Room.

=== Mid-20th century ===

==== Hilton operation ====
U.S. Realty continued to lose money through the 1930s, and started selling off its properties, including the Plaza Hotel. In October 1943, Atlas Corporation, collaborating with hotelier Conrad Hilton, bought the Plaza Hotel for $7.4 million. At the time, the Plaza was 61 percent occupied, and many public areas were closed due to supply shortages caused by World War II. Hilton subsequently spent $6 million refurbishing the hotel. During mid-1944, the lobby on Fifth Avenue was renovated and its mezzanine was enclosed. The Palm Court skylight, having fallen into disrepair, was removed for the installation of air conditioning equipment. A mezzanine was also built above the hotel&#x27;s former courtyard, and the room itself became the Court Lounge. The brokerage office at the ground level&#x27;s northwestern corner was turned into the Oak Bar, which opened in January 1945; and EF Hutton was relegated to the Fifth Avenue lobby&#x27;s mezzanine. The contractor for the renovations may have been Frederick P. Platt &amp; Brother, which was the Plaza Hotel&#x27;s primary contractor in the 1940s.

The Plaza Hotel Corporation, the hotel&#x27;s operator, was merged with the Hilton Hotels Corporation in 1946. The following year, the Plaza Rendez-Vous opened within the old grill room space. By the early 1950s, women were allowed inside the Oak Room and Bar during evenings and in the summer. The Oak Room and Bar was still a men-only space before 3 p.m., while the stock exchanges were open.

Hilton sold the hotel in 1953 to Boston industrialist A.M. &quot;Sonny&quot; Sonnabend for $15 million, and immediately leased it back for 2.5 years. Sonnabend became president of national restaurant chain Childs Company in 1955, and Childs purchased the Plaza that November for $6.2 million in stock. The same year, the ground-floor Plaza Restaurant was renamed the Edwardian Room. James S. Graham Jr. simultaneously renovated the State Apartment, and air conditioning was installed in each guest room. Childs became the Hotel Corporation of America (HCA) in 1956, and Hilton&#x27;s lease was renewed indefinitely that year. HCA sold the Plaza to Lawrence Wien in November 1958 for $21 million and immediately leased it back for 25 years. The transaction included curtailing Hilton&#x27;s lease to April 1960, at which time HCA assumed the operating lease.

==== Sonnabend operation ====
The Plaza Hotel experienced financial difficulties during the early 1960s; but under Sonnabend&#x27;s management, the Plaza&#x27;s financial outlook improved by 1964. The facade of the hotel was cleaned in late 1960, the first time that the exterior had been fully cleaned since its construction. This was followed, in 1962, by extensive exterior and interior renovations, which resulted in the redecoration of many of the suites and public rooms. Four of the hotel&#x27;s hydraulic elevators were replaced with electric elevators in 1964, including the three elevators in the 58th Street lobby. A second phase of renovations was announced the same year, which entailed enlarging some public rooms and replacing the ground-floor barber shop with a Trader Vic&#x27;s bar. The ballroom&#x27;s foyer and stair hall were combined during this renovation, which was completed by 1965, having cost $9 million.

Upon Sonny Sonnabend&#x27;s death in 1964, his son Roger took over the hotel. Further changes to the hotel&#x27;s ownership occurred the next year, when Sol Goldman and Alexander DiLorenzo&#x27;s firm, Wellington Associates, bought an option to obtain a half-interest in the underlying land from Hilton. The policy of only allowing men to have lunch at the Oak Room was ended in 1969. In 1971, HCA, by then renamed Sonesta Hotels, announced another round of renovations1. This included the redecoration of the Grand Ballroom, as well as the replacement of the Edwardian Room with a restaurant called the Green Tulip, whose pink, lime, and brown design by Sally Dryden received a largely negative reception from the public. The ballroom was also renovated at this time.

The renovations coincided with a decline in Sonesta&#x27;s and the Plaza&#x27;s finances, with the hotel recording negative net income in 1971. Sonesta repurchased the Plaza Hotel from Wien in 1972. Shortly afterward, Sonesta looked to sell its interest in the hotel to Harry Helmsley, and Wellington attempted to take over Sonesta by buying its shares. Both the sale and the attempted Sonesta takeover were unsuccessful; and Wellington made an offer for Sonesta&#x27;s share of the hotel in April 1974, which Sonesta refused.

=== Late 20th century ===

==== Westin ownership ====
In November 1974, Western International Hotels announced its intention to buy the Plaza Hotel from Sonesta for $25 million. The same year, the Edwardian Room was largely restored according to designs by Charles Winslow, and was rebranded as the Plaza Suite. Following Western International&#x27;s acquisition of the Plaza, it renovated the interior spaces, cleaned the exterior, and restored much of the hotel according to the original designs, at a total cost of $200 million. The four hydraulic elevators serving the Central Park South lobby, among the last of their type in the city, were replaced with electric elevators in 1976. Westin also bought the Shinn murals that year for $1 million; they had not been part of the original sale. The Rambusch Company was hired to restore the Oak Room and Bar. The next year, a 204-seat theater called Cinema 3 opened in the basement. The Persian Room was closed in 1978, and a clothing boutique opened in its place. Westin had planned to restore the Palm Court&#x27;s skylight, but this did not happen.

By the late 1970s, the Plaza Hotel was again making a net profit. Western International changed its name to Westin Hotels in 1981; the hotel was renamed soon after, becoming &quot;The Westin Plaza&quot;. However, Westin started to lose money in the late 1980s. By 1987, Westin&#x27;s parent company Allegis Corporation announced its intent to sell the Plaza, generating interest from at least 150 investors. The Plaza, along with the rest of the Westin chain, was transferred to the Aoki Corporation and Robert M. Bass in January 1988. Shortly afterward, Philip Pilevsky and Arthur G. Cohen expressed their intent to buy the Plaza and turn it into a hotel-cooperative.

==== Trump ownership ====

In March 1988, real estate developer Donald Trump bought the Plaza using a $407 million loan from several banks. After gaining title to the hotel in July, Trump put his wife Ivana in charge of renovating and managing the hotel. The Trumps subsequently announced a major renovation program, which entailed restoring the lobby and some of the other interior elements. The work also involved gilding many surfaces, replacing carpets, and reupholstering furniture. Trump also decided to shut down the Trader Vic&#x27;s in the basement in 1989, saying it had become &quot;tacky&quot;. The hotel made a modest profit for about two years after Trump&#x27;s purchase, largely from increased occupancy, suite rates, and banquet bookings.

Trump had borrowed extensively to purchase the Plaza, but the hotel&#x27;s operating income was several million dollars below the breakeven point. As a result, the hotel&#x27;s debt ultimately grew to $600 million. By 1991, Trump was making plans to pay off the hotel&#x27;s debt by selling off the vast majority of its units as condominiums. Trump estimated that the conversion would net $750 million, almost twice the purchase price. Trump also considered converting the offices under the mansard roof to penthouse condos, according to designs by Lee Harris Pomeroy. The conversion plan failed because it would have been unprofitable, due to a then-recent drop-off in prices in the city&#x27;s real estate market. In March 1992, as a last resort, Trump approached the Plaza&#x27;s creditors, a group of seventy banks led by Citibank, who agreed to take a 49% stake in the hotel in exchange for forgiveness of $250 million in debt and an interest-rate reduction. The agreement was submitted as a prepackaged bankruptcy in November 1992 and approved the next month.

==== Kwek and Al-Waleed ownership ====
By 1994, Trump was looking to sell the Plaza before Citibank and other creditors could find a buyer, which would have wiped out his investment. One of his executives identified Hong Kong–based Sun Hung Kai Properties as a potential buyer. The deal fell through after the family of Sun Hung Kai executive Walter Kwok got trapped behind a jammed door while touring the Plaza Hotel. Trump, attempting to maintain appearances, threatened to sue the &quot;New York Post&quot; that December for reporting that the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, had made an offer for the hotel. Meanwhile, the creditors had also identified Singaporean developer Kwek Leng Beng as a likely buyer. Kwek&#x27;s company, Singaporean chain City Developments Limited (CDL), offered to take over the creditors&#x27; ownership stake. Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal was also interested in buying the Plaza; and by March 1995, Al-Waleed and CDL had raised $325 million for a controlling stake. Trump unsuccessfully petitioned Kwek to partner with him instead of Al-Waleed.

Trump sold the controlling stake to Kwek and Al-Waleed in April 1995. As part of the transaction, the hotel&#x27;s debt was reduced to $25 million. Kwek and Al-Waleed each bought a 42 percent stake, and Citibank received the other 16 percent stake, a move intended to prevent Trump from intervening in the sale. The partnership also agreed that, if the mansard penthouses were ever created, some of the profits would be shared with Trump. In 1997, Hong Kong developer Great Eagle Holdings agreed to buy half of Al-Waleed&#x27;s stake in the Plaza Hotel. DiLorenzo International renovated the ballroom in the mid-1990s, and Adam Tihany refurbished the Edwardian Room prior to 2001. The Plaza was highly profitable in the late 1990s, with operating income of almost $46 million at the end of that decade.

=== 21st century ===

==== El Ad ownership ====
The September 11 attacks in 2001 resulted in a downturn in the New York City tourism industry. Correspondingly, the Plaza&#x27;s operating profits decreased greatly, leaving Kwek and Al-Waleed unable to refurbish the Plaza as they had previously planned to do. In 2004, they sold the Plaza Hotel for $675 million to El Ad Properties, run by developer Yitzhak Tshuva. El Ad wished to add residential and commercial units, but initially faced pushback from hotel unions and preservationists, who opposed El Ad&#x27;s plan to remove most of the hotel rooms and convert the restaurant spaces to stores. In particular, preservationists opposed the conversion of the ballroom into commercial space, even though no changes to the ballroom&#x27;s architecture were planned, because part of the ballroom occupied a site that was zoned for residential use only. After over sixty hours of discussions between El Ad and the hotel unions, they came to an agreement on April 14, 2005, under which El Ad would convert fewer units to apartments, while preserving more of the hotel suites.

The Plaza Hotel temporarily closed for a $450 million renovation on April 30, 2005, two weeks after the agreement had been brokered. Fairmont Hotels and Resorts took over operation of the hotel portion during late 2005. The Plaza&#x27;s furnishings were auctioned on-site and at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 2006. During the renovation, most of the short-term hotel rooms were converted into residential units, and the Palm Court&#x27;s stained glass ceiling was restored. In addition, floors 18 and 19 were extended toward the interior courtyard, while a small floor 20 was created above the existing roof.

The hotel reopened on March 1, 2008. Though the real-estate market in general had slowed down due to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, apartments at the Plaza Hotel were being sold for millions of dollars, disproportionately impacting average apartment prices in Manhattan. The hotel unveiled its retail collection, an underground mall featuring luxury brands, in November 2008. Initially, the Plaza sought to attract foreign companies, since many American luxury brands already rented space nearby or sold goods in the neighboring Bergdorf Goodman Building. The Plaza Food Hall opened in the underground mall in 2010, anchored by the Todd English Food Hall in collaboration with chef Todd English. By then, El Ad was struggling to find tenants for the mall, and several residents had lost money selling their apartments. The Oak Room restaurant closed in July 2011, two years after the renovation was completed.

====Sahara India ownership====
In mid-2012, Sahara India Pariwar agreed to buy a 75 percent controlling stake for $570 million from El Ad Properties. The deal closed that December. However, even at the time of the sale, Sahara was experiencing legal issues and was selling off other properties that it owned. The development of the nearby Billionaires&#x27; Row, an area with several residential skyscrapers marketed for the ultra-wealthy, also negatively affected sales at the Plaza. The Plaza&#x27;s net income decreased from $3.67 million, in 2012, to negative $1.2 million, in 2014, a figure that declined even further, to negative $10 million, by 2017. Two years after buying the Plaza, Sahara&#x27;s Subrata Roy announced that he was looking for a buyer for his company&#x27;s $4 billion majority stake. The Sultan of Brunei made an unsuccessful bid of $680 million. In August 2017, after he was unable to secure a buyer, Roy hired a broker to sell the hotel, prompting inquiries from about 50 potential buyers.

Simultaneously, former co-owner Al-Waleed, whose Kingdom Holding Company now owned a minor stake in the hotel, partnered with Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation. Kingdom and Ashkenazy&#x27;s partnership included a right of first refusal, which allowed the companies to match any third-party offer for the hotel. In May 2018, the Sahara Group announced it had finalized a deal with businessmen Shahal M. Khan and Kamran Hakim to buy a majority share of the hotel for $600 million. However, Ashkenazy and Kingdom exercised their right of first refusal, and sued Sahara for trying to sell the hotel to a third party. Ashkenazy and Kingdom received an extension to close their purchase of the Plaza, but instead opted to sell their stake to Qatari state-owned hotelier Katara Hospitality, which the companies felt was better positioned to close the sale.

====Katara Hospitality ownership====
In July 2018, Katara Hospitality acquired full ownership of the Plaza Hotel after buying Sahara&#x27;s and Askenazy and Kingdom&#x27;s stakes. Under Katara&#x27;s ownership, the condominium units garnered high asking prices: for instance, a four-bedroom unit was listed for $45 million in early 2020. Around the same time, the Plaza&#x27;s condominium board sought to make repairs to the facade. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, and a corresponding downturn in tourism globally, the Plaza&#x27;s hotel rooms were temporarily closed in March 2020 for an indefinite period, and several hundred employees were laid off. When the Plaza Hotel officially reopened in May 2021, public spaces such as the Palm Court were rearranged to allow for social distancing. By the mid-2020s, the values of many condominiums had decreased, amid competition from newer luxury developments nearby and complaints about poor-quality material.

== Residents and guests ==

=== Residents ===
When the current Plaza Hotel opened in 1907, the first guest to sign its register was Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt. The hotel also housed other wealthy residents, such as George Jay Gould, as well as Oliver Harriman Jr. and his wife Grace Carley Harriman. John Gates, the hotel&#x27;s co-developer, had a 16-room apartment on floor 3, which he rented for $15,000 a year. Harry Frank Guggenheim lived in the hotel&#x27;s State Apartment, while Russian princess Vilma Lwoff-Parlaghy, a prominent portrait painter in the early 20th century, lived in a suite on floor 3 with her lion. The hotel&#x27;s appeal to the wealthy came from the fact that, in the early 20th century, apartments at the Plaza were generally cheaper than in more upscale apartment buildings, and that it faced Central Park, which at the time was well patronized by the wealthy.

Later in the 20th century, the Plaza Hotel served as home to &quot;wealthy widows&quot;, such as performer Kay Thompson, who wrote the &quot;Eloise&quot; children&#x27;s book series about a young girl who lived at the hotel. During the Great Depression, the &quot;wealthy widows&quot; were considered &quot;a tourist attraction in their own right&quot;, with their rents keeping the hotel solvent. The hotel&#x27;s other residents included playwright Ferenc Molnár.

After many units were converted to condominium units in 2008, the Plaza Hotel became even more coveted by the wealthy. However, only about a third of these buyers were full-time residents, with the remainder using their Plaza condominiums as pieds-a-terre. The residents included executives such as New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, JetBlue CEO David Barger, Bear Stearns CEO James Cayne, Viacom CEO Thomas E. Dooley, Sony Music Entertainment CEO Doug Morris, and &quot;Idols&quot; franchise producer Simon Fuller. Other notable residents included developer Christian Candy and fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

=== Guests ===
The guest rooms have also housed notable personalities, such as opera singer Enrico Caruso, as well as novelists F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald. Frank Lloyd Wright often stayed at the Plaza when he was designing the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue, maintaining a suite on the second floor between 1954 and 1959. Art dealer Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen, who helped assemble the Frick Collection at the nearby Frick House, lived at the Plaza and held important auctions in the ballroom. In addition, the Beatles stayed at the Plaza Hotel during their first visit to the United States in February 1964.

== Social scene ==
The Plaza Hotel became associated with celebrities and the wealthy upon its opening, surpassing the original Waldorf Astoria in that respect. The Palm Court (then the tea room), with its mostly female guest list, was particularly frequented. Weeks after the hotel&#x27;s 1907 opening, actress Mrs Patrick Campbell attempted to smoke there, and the resulting controversy boosted the Plaza&#x27;s stature. In January 1908, crowds flocked to see heiress Gladys Vanderbilt and her fiancé, Hungarian count László Széchenyi, have tea, while Theodora Shonts arrived with her fiancé Emmanuel d&#x27;Albert de Luynes, the Duke of Chaulnes. That year, the &quot;New York World&quot; dubbed the hotel the &quot;Home-for-the-Incurably Opulent&quot;. By 1909, the Palm Court was consistently exceeding its 350-person capacity.

During the 1920s, the basement&#x27;s grill room was a popular meeting place for young adults born during the Lost Generation. The Oak Room was frequented by actor George M. Cohan, and a commemorative plaque for Cohan was installed in the room in the 1940s after his death. The Persian Room was popular with the &quot;cafe society&quot;, being frequented by socialites and fashion trendsetters. Eddy Duchin and Hildegarde were among the Persian Room&#x27;s early performers, and it later attracted others, such as Eartha Kitt, Peggy Lee, and Liza Minnelli. By the 1970s, the Persian Room hosted performances by pop singers such as Robert Goulet and Dusty Springfield.

The hotel has also been popular among world leaders, particularly presidents of the United States. The first of these was Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th U.S. president, who moved his Republican Party&#x27;s events to the Plaza Hotel from the Fifth Avenue Hotel after the closure of the latter in 1908. Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s distant cousin, president Franklin D. Roosevelt, had his birthday luncheon in the Palm Court in 1935. Other U.S. presidents who frequented the hotel&#x27;s guestrooms or restaurants have included William Howard Taft, Harry S. Truman, and Richard Nixon, as well as onetime owner Donald Trump. For other world leaders, the Plaza Hotel kept a set of national flags, so that an appropriate one could be displayed whenever a foreign head of state visited. Chiang Ching-kuo, at the time the Vice Premier of the Republic of China, was shot by Taiwanese student Peter Huang in an attempted assassination at the hotel on April 24, 1970.

The Plaza Hotel has hosted diplomatic events, as in September 1985, when the finance ministers of several countries signed the Plaza Accord, by which the U.S. dollar was depreciated in relation to other currencies. The Plaza Hotel hosted the NBA draft from 1962 until 1967, as well as in 1978 and 1979.

=== Receptions ===
The Terrace Room has frequently been used for press conferences, luncheons, and receptions. For instance, it hosted a 1956 press conference where Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe talked about their upcoming film &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl.&quot; At a press conference in the Terrace Room in 1968, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor discussed their film &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot;. During the Beatles&#x27; 1964 stay at the hotel, visitors were allowed to take pictures with the Beatles in the Terrace Room.

=== Benefits and weddings ===
Upon the Grand Ballroom&#x27;s opening in 1921, it immediately became popular as a venue for debutante balls, including those in honor of Joan Whitney Payson and Cathleen Vanderbilt. The rebuilt ballroom hosted social benefits, such as a dinner honoring physicist Marie Curie in 1929, and a meeting of the Girls Service League in 1935 that was attended by U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Following World War II, the Grand Ballroom again became a popular venue for debutante balls and benefits, including a disabled veterans&#x27; benefit called the December Ball, as well as an event benefiting the Kennedy Child Care Study Center in 1959. Writer Truman Capote hosted the &quot;Black and White Ball&quot; there in 1966, in honor of publisher Katharine Graham. Another popular venue for benefits was the Terrace Court, which hosted events such as the Mid-Winter Ball in 1949.

The Grand Ballroom and Terrace Room have also been used for weddings and wedding receptions. For example, the Terrace Room held the reception for figure skater Sonja Henie&#x27;s 1949 wedding to Winthrop Gardiner Jr. Peter Lawford and Patricia Kennedy Lawford&#x27;s wedding reception was hosted in the ballroom in 1954, as was David Eisenhower and Julie Nixon Eisenhower&#x27;s reception in 1968. The ballroom also hosted Donald Trump and Marla Maples&#x27;s 1993 wedding. In 2000, actors Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones married at the Plaza.

== Status as an icon ==
The Plaza Hotel has become an icon of New York City. Paul Goldberger, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1982, stated that the Plaza had become an important part of the city&#x27;s architectural history, similar to the Grand Central Terminal and the New York Public Library Main Branch. As another historian said, &quot;Every tourist I&#x27;ve ever met, every [tour] group I&#x27;ve ever had, they all know the Plaza Hotel&quot;. The National Trust for Historic Preservation recognized the Plaza Hotel as a Historic Hotel of America.

=== Critical reception ===
Upon the present building&#x27;s opening, the design of the hotel, particularly the interiors, received mostly positive criticism. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the exterior as &quot;a fitting introduction to the interior&quot;, praising the interior for its relative modesty compared to other hotels. However, H. W. Frohne wrote that Hardenbergh had &quot;fail[ed] to make the public rooms entertaining&quot;. Critics for two architectural magazines also praised the carved woodwork in the Oak Room and the greenery that originally adorned the Palm Court. For the latter, the &quot;Times&quot; praised the &quot;gardenlike&quot; effect of the Palm Court, enhanced by its glass ceiling. Frank Lloyd Wright wrote that Hardenbergh&#x27;s exterior design for the Plaza Hotel was an early skyscraper with &quot;a human sense&quot;, in contrast to later skyscrapers, which Wright described as &quot;monstrous thing[s]&quot;.

In the 1967 book &quot;The Plaza, Its Life and Times&quot;, Eve Brown wrote that &quot;The Plaza has managed always to be in tune with the times, its dignity unruffled, its good taste unimpaired&quot;. Ada Louise Huxtable wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1971 that the Plaza Hotel was the city&#x27;s &quot;most celebrated symbol of cosmopolitan and turn-of-the-century splendor&quot;, speaking negatively only of the short-lived Green Tulip restaurant. Judith Gura described the interior spaces as &quot;merg[ing] seamlessly into a harmonious ensemble&quot;, despite each space having a distinct character. Curtis Gathje, the Plaza Hotel&#x27;s official historian and a 25-year veteran of the hotel&#x27;s staff, stated in 2007, &quot;The Plaza is the epitome of civilized New York.&quot;

The site, facing Central Park, was seen as particularly prominent. As early as 1892, Moses King called it &quot;a location of unsurpassed beauty&quot;. The rebuilt Plaza was described in a 1907 &quot;Architectural Record&quot; article as having a site that was &quot;the most unobstructed and charming which could have been selected for a large metropolitan hotel&quot;, despite being smaller than that of competitors, such as the Waldorf Astoria. According to Goldberger, the Plaza Hotel&#x27;s location along both Grand Army Plaza and Central Park made it particularly imposing, with two primary facades. The American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2007 survey &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; ranked the Plaza Hotel among the top 150 buildings in the United States. The 2010 edition of the &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; emphasized the park views, characterizing the third- through fifth-floor suites along Central Park South as having &quot;one of the most exciting views of New York&quot;.

=== Landmark designations ===
The demolition of the nearby Savoy-Plaza in 1964, and its replacement with the General Motors Building, resulted in a preservation movement to save the Plaza Hotel and nearby structures. This prompted the New York City Planning Commission to rezone a three-block area around Grand Army Plaza, including the Plaza Hotel, in 1968. The Plaza Hotel&#x27;s exterior was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1969. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and it was made a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

A large part of the main public space in the interior—including the lobbies, ballroom, and restaurant spaces—was made a New York City designated landmark in 2005. The interior-landmark designation was partially motivated by opposition to El Ad&#x27;s original plans to renovate the hotel during 2004. The restaurant spaces, preserved under the interior-landmark designation, would have been converted into retail space. The Edwardian Room was not originally part of the landmark designation, but it was ultimately protected along with the other rooms.

=== In media ===
The Plaza Hotel has been used as a setting for several works of literature throughout its history. Most notably, it served as the setting for the &quot;Eloise&quot; series of books, the success of which led the hotel&#x27;s owners during the 1960s to hang the character&#x27;s portrait in the lobby. The Plaza was also featured in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

The hotel is also one of the most popular filming locations in New York City. Films shot or set in the hotel include &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1967), &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), and &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992). Other films that show the Plaza include &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981), &quot; Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986), &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992), &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), and &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; (1994).

The Plaza has also refused or set unusual conditions for some productions wanting to film there. For example, when the Plaza&#x27;s managers refused to allow the producers of &quot;Big Business&quot; (1988) to film there, the film&#x27;s producers created their own version of the Plaza Hotel on a sound stage. When &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; was being filmed, director Chris Columbus said that Donald Trump requested a cameo in the film, in exchange for allowing the film crew to shoot scenes in the lobby. The lobby scene involved the star sliding across the floor, so the carpeting was removed, thus revealing some old tilework with the Plaza logo that had been concealed for several decades. The management decided not to replace the carpet.

<text>Świńka (Polish for &quot;Boar&quot;) is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) families.

==History==
The Świńka dynasty possesses one of the oldest recorded coats of arms in Poland. According to legend, the history of the Świńka family began in 712, when a certain Biwoj, squire to Queen Libusza, heroically gifted her a giant boar that he had hunted down in the forest. The queen rewarded him with the coat of arms (though this was long before Western heraldry as we know it developed), the village of Świny (, both referring to pigs) in Silesia, and her daughter. The boar&#x27;s head in the field and blonde maiden on the crest allude to this tale.

==Blazon==
==Notable bearers==
Notable bearers of this coat of arms have included:
* Józef Zajączek, Prince, General
* Andrzej Czacki, Catholic bishop
* Jakub Świnka (1283–1314), Archbishop of Gniezno
* Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski, General in US Civil War

<doc id="1065272" wikidata="Q4118075" url="?curid=1065272" title="Polystrate fossil">
<text>A polystrate fossil is a fossil of a single organism (such as a tree trunk) that extends through more than one geological stratum. The word &quot;polystrate&quot; is not a standard geological term. This term is typically found in creationist publications.

This term is typically applied to &quot;fossil forests&quot; of upright fossil tree trunks and stumps that have been found worldwide, i.e. in the Eastern United States, Eastern Canada, England, France, Germany, and Australia, typically associated with coal-bearing strata. Within Carboniferous coal-bearing strata, it is also very common to find what are called &quot;Stigmaria&quot; (root stocks) within the same stratum. Stigmaria are completely absent in post-Carboniferous strata, which contain either coal, polystrate trees, or both.

==Geological explanation==
In geology, such fossils are referred to as either upright fossil trunks, upright fossil trees, or &quot;T0 assemblages&quot;. According to mainstream models of sedimentary environments, they are formed by rare to infrequent brief episodes of rapid sedimentation separated by long periods of either slow deposition, nondeposition, or a combination of both.

Upright fossils typically occur in layers associated with an actively subsiding coastal plain or rift basin, or with the accumulation of volcanic material around a periodically erupting stratovolcano. Typically, this period of rapid sedimentation was followed by a period of time - decades to thousands of years long - characterized by very slow or no accumulation of sediments. In river deltas and other coastal-plain settings, rapid sedimentation is often the end result of a brief period of accelerated subsidence of an area of coastal plain relative to sea level caused by salt tectonics, global sea-level rise, growth faulting, continental margin collapse, or some combination of these factors. For example, geologists such as John W. F. Waldron and Michael C. Rygel have argued that the rapid burial and preservation of polystrate fossil trees found at Joggins, Nova Scotia directly result from rapid subsidence, caused by salt tectonics within an already subsiding pull-apart basin, and from the resulting rapid accumulation of sediments. The specific layers containing polystrate fossils occupy only a very limited fraction of the total area of any of these basins.

===Yellowstone===
The upright fossil trees of the Gallatin Petrified Forest in the Gallatin Range and the Yellowstone Petrified Forest at Amethyst Mountain and Specimen Ridge in Yellowstone National Park, occur buried within the lahars and other volcanic deposits comprising the Eocene Lamar River Formation as the result of periods of rapid sedimentation associated with explosive volcanism. This type of volcanism generates and deposits large quantities of loose volcanic material as a blanket over the slope of a volcano, as happened during the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Both during and for years after a period of volcanism, lahars and normal stream activity wash this loose volcanic material downslope. These processes result in the rapid burial of large areas of the surrounding countryside beneath several meters of sediment, as directly observed during the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. As with modern lahar deposits, the sedimentary layers containing upright trees of the Yellowstone petrified forest are discontinuous and very limited in areal extent. Individual layers containing upright trees and individual buried forests occupy only a very small fraction of the total area of Yellowstone National Park.

===Fossil soils===
Geologists have recognized innumerable fossil soils (paleosols) throughout the strata containing upright fossils at Joggins in Nova Scotia, in the Yellowstone petrified forests, in the coal mines of the Black Warrior Basin of Alabama, and at many other locations. The layer immediately underlying coal seams, often called either &quot;seatearth&quot; or &quot;underclay&quot;, typically either consists of or contains a paleosol. Paleosols are soils which were formed by subaerial weathering during periods of very slow or no accumulation of sediments. Later, renewed sedimentation buried these soils to create paleosols. These paleosols are identified on the basis of the presence of structures and microstructures unique to soils; animal burrows and molds of plant roots of various sizes and types; recognizable soil-profile development; and alteration of minerals by soil processes. In many cases, these paleosols are virtually identical to modern soils.

Geologists, who have studied upright fossils found in sedimentary rocks exposed in various outcrops for decades, have described the upright fossil trees as being deeply rooted in place and typically rooted in recognizable paleosols. Researchers such as Falcon and Rygel et al., have published detailed field-sketches and pictures of upright tree-fossils with intact root systems, which are rooted within recognizable paleosols. In the case of the upright fossil trees of the Yellowstone petrified forests, it has been found that the upright fossil trees, except for relatively short stumps, are rooted in place within the underlying sediments. Typically, the sediments within which trees are rooted have paleosols developed within them. Retallack (1981, 1997) has published pictures and diagrams of the Yellowstone upright fossil trees having intact root systems developed within paleosols found within these strata.

===Formation by regeneration===
Geologists have also found that some of the larger upright fossil trees found within Carboniferous coal-bearing strata show evidence of regeneration after being partially buried by sediments. In these cases, the trees were clearly alive when they were partially buried by sediments. The accumulated sediment was insufficient to kill the trees immediately because of their size. As a result, some of them developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface. Until they either died or were overwhelmed by the accumulating sediments, these trees would likely continue to regenerate by adding height and new roots with each increment of sediment, eventually leaving several meters of former &quot;trunk&quot; buried underground as sediments accumulated.

===Formation by Carboniferous deglacial meltwater-pulses===
In addition, part of the Carboniferous Period was a period of extensive and thick continental ice sheets. During the Carboniferous ice age, the repeated glacial – interglacial cycles caused major changes in the thickness and extent of continental ice sheets. When these ice sheets expanded in extent and thickness, eustatic sea level typically fell by over a . When these ice sheets shrank in extent and thickness, eustatic sea level typically rose again by typically over a . As occurred during the Holocene Epoch for Meltwater pulse 1A and Meltwater pulse 1B, brief episodes of rapid melting of Carboniferous, Gondwanan continental ice sheets likely caused very rapid rises in sea level that would have abruptly inundated low-lying coastal swamps and drowned the forests growing on them. Based on the sedimentology of roof strata of surface and underground coal mines and cyclothems containing the fossils of upright and in situ tree trunks, geologists proposed that the flooding of coastal swamp by deglacial meltwater pulses resulted in the rapid flooding of coastal forests, particularly along preexisting coastal rivers and streams, over large areas of coastal swamp. During and after their submergence, upright trunks of drowned coastal forests were buried by tidally influenced sedimentation.

===Association with marine fossils===
Geologists find nothing anomalous about upright fossil trees found in Carboniferous coal-bearing strata being associated with marine or brackish-water fossils. Because they lived on subsiding coastal plains or pull-apart basins open to the coast, it was quite frequent for subsidence to periodically outpace the accumulation of sediments such that adjacent shallow marine waters would periodically inundate coastal plains in which the trees were buried. As a result, sediments containing marine fossils would periodically accumulate within these areas before being replaced by coastal swamps - either as sediments filled in the shallow sea or as the sea level fell. Also, according to ecological reconstructions by geologists, specific assemblages of the types of trees found as upright fossils occupied brackish water, even saline coastal swamps much like modern mangrove swamps. Thus, finding marine and brackish water fossils associated with these trees is no different than finding brackish water or marine animals living in modern mangrove swamps.

A detailed study by Taylor and Vinn (2006) of the microstructure of fossils which have been traditionally identified as &quot;Spirorbis&quot; in the geological literature revealed that they consist of the remains of at least two completely different animals. Taylor and Vinn discovered that the &quot;Spirorbis&quot; fossils found in sedimentary strata, including the Joggins and other Carboniferous coal measures deposited from the Ordovician to Triassic periods are the remains of an extinct order of lophophorates (now called microconchids) unrelated to modern marine tube-worms (Annelids) to which the genus &quot;Spirorbis&quot; belongs. This contradicts arguments made by Harold Coffin and other creationists that &quot;Spirorbis&quot; fossils within strata containing polystrate fossils indicate their deposition in a marine environment, because these fossils are classified as the remains of extinct fresh and brackish water microconchids instead of the remains of the marine genera &quot;Spirorbis&quot; as they have been misidentified in the geologic literature.

===Quaternary examples===
Scientists interpret &quot;polystrate fossils&quot; as fossils buried in a geologically short time span - either by one large depositional event or by several smaller ones. Geologists see no need to invoke a global flood to explain upright fossils. This position of geologists is supported by numerous documented examples, a few of which are discussed in the paragraphs below, of buried upright tree-trunks that have been observed buried in the Holocene volcanic deposits of Mount St. Helens, Skamania County, Washington, and Mount Pinatubo, Philippines; in the deltaic and fluvial sediments of the Mississippi River Delta; and in glacial deposits within the midwestern United States. These buried upright trees demonstrate that conventional geologic processes are capable of burying and preserving trees in an upright position such that in time, they will become fossilized.

====Volcanic deposits====
At this time, the best documented occurrences of unfossilized buried upright trees occur within the historic and late-Holocene volcanic deposits of Mount St. Helens (Skamania County, Washington) and of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. At Mount St. Helens, both unfossilized and partially fossilized trees have occurred in many outcrops of volcanic debris and mud flows (lahars) and pyroclastic flow deposits, which date from 1885 to over 30,000 BP., along the South Toutle and other rivers. Late Holocene forests of upright trees also occur within the volcanic deposits of other Cascade Range volcanoes. In the space of a few years after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the erosion of loose pyroclastic deposits covering the slopes of the mountain generated a series of volcanic lahars, which ultimately buried large parts of the countryside along major streams draining these slopes beneath several meters of volcanic sediments. The repeated deposition of sediments by volcanic lahars and by sediment-filled rivers not only created innumerable polystrate trees, but also &quot;polystrate&quot; telephone-poles, churches, and houses, over a period a few years. The volcanic deposits enclosing modern upright trees are often virtually identical in their sedimentary structures, external and internal layering, texture, buried soils, and other general character to the volcanic deposits containing the Yellowstone buried forests. As in case of modern forests buried by lahars, the individual buried forests of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest and the layers containing them are very limited in their areal extent.

====Deltaic deposits====
Within excavations for Interstate Highway 10 in the United States of America, and in borrow pits, in landfills, and archaeological surveys, unfossilized upright trees have been found buried within late Holocene, even historic, fluvial and deltaic sediments underlying the surface of the Mississippi River Delta and the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. In one case, borrow pits dug in the natural levees of Bayou Teche near Patterson, Louisiana, have exposed completely buried, 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) high, upright trunks of cypress trees. Northeast of Donaldsonville, Louisiana, a borrow pit excavated for fill used to maintain nearby artificial levees, exposed three levels of rooted upright tree trunks stacked on top of each other lying completely buried beneath the surface of Point Houmas, a patch of floodplain lying within a meander loop of the current course of the Mississippi River. While searching for buried archaeological sites, archaeologists excavated a 12 ft (3.6 meter) high upright rooted cypress tree completely buried within a natural levee of the Atchafalaya River within the Indian Bayou Wildlife Management Area just south of Krotz Springs, Louisiana. Radiocarbon dates and historic documents collected for this archaeological survey, during which this and other upright trees were found, of the Indian Bayou Wildlife Management Area demonstrated that these upright trees were buried in the 1800s, during the initial diversion of Mississippi River&#x27;s flow into the Atchafalaya River.

====Glacial deposits====
Unfossilized, late Pleistocene upright trees have been found buried beneath glacial deposits within North America along the southern edge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. These buried forests were created when the southern edge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet locally dammed valleys. As a result, meltwater lakes filled these valleys and submerged forests within them. Sediments released by the melting of the adjacent ice sheet rapidly filled these lakes, which quickly buried and preserved the submerged forests lying within them. One forest of &quot;in situ&quot;, 24,000-year-old unfossilized upright trees was exposed by excavations for a quarry near Charleston, Illinois. Excavations for a tailings pond about Marquette, Michigan, exposed an &quot;in situ&quot; forest of unfossilized trees, which are about 10,000 years old, buried in glacial lake and stream sediments.

<text>The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California (in case citations, E.D. Cal.) is a federal court in the Ninth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The District was created on March 18, 1966, with the division of the Northern and Southern districts, leading to the creation of the Central and Eastern districts.

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Eastern District of California represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. the acting United States attorney is Michelle M. Beckwith.

== Organization of the court ==

The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California is one of four federal judicial districts in California. Court for the District is held at the Robert E. Coyle U.S. Courthouse in Fresno and Robert T. Matsui U.S. Courthouse in Sacramento.

* Fresno Division comprises the following counties: Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne.
* Sacramento Division comprises the following counties: Alpine, Amador, Butte, Colusa, El Dorado, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Solano, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo, and Yuba.
* Bakersfield Office hears misdemeanor and petty criminal offenses on federal lands and National Parks in Inyo and Kern counties. Court is held at Bakersfield, Edwards Air Force Base, and Ridgecrest.
* Redding Office hears misdemeanor and petty criminal offenses on federal lands and National Parks in Northern California. Court is held at Sierra Army Depot, Redding, and Susanville.
* Yosemite Office hears misdemeanor and petty criminal offenses in Yosemite National Park. National parks are under federal jurisdiction. The perennially large crowds of tourists at Yosemite create a unique situation justifying the presence of a courthouse inside the park itself.
== Current judges ==

<text>Jamestown Island is a island in the James River in Virginia, part of James City County. It is located off Glasshouse Point, to which it is connected via a causeway to the Colonial Parkway. Much of the island is wetland, including both swamp and marsh.

==History==
Prior to English settlement, the nearby area was home to the Paspahegh people, or Virginia Algonquians. In May 1607, the island (then a peninsula) became site of James Fort, the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. The chief of the Powatan at that time, also named Powhatan, was father of Pocahontas. 

After Powhatan&#x27;s death in 1618, hostilities with colonists escalated under his brother, Opechancanough. 

His large-scale attacks in 1622 and 1644 met strong reprisals by the English, resulting in the near elimination of both the settlement and the tribe. After Bacon&#x27;s rebellion in 1677, Jamestown lasted until 1699, when it was abandoned in favor of a new site at Williamsburg.

==Significance==
By the early 20th century, the isthmus connecting the landform to Glasshouse Point had eroded, making it a proper island. Today, most of the island is a part of Colonial National Historical Park, including Historic Jamestown. 

The rediscovery of the James Fort in 1996 by Jamestown Rediscovery has led to significant archaeological discoveries of the early colonial settler period.

<text>Kosmos 140 ( meaning &quot;Cosmos 140&quot;), Soyuz 7K-OK No.3, was an uncrewed flight of the Soyuz spacecraft. It was the third attempted test flight of the Soyuz 7K-OK model, after orbital (Kosmos 133) and launch (Soyuz 11A511) failures of the first two Soyuz spacecraft.

== History ==
The follow-up to Kosmos 133 (Soyuz 7K-OK No.2), 28 November 1966, was planned for 14 December 1966 (Soyuz 7K-OK No.1) but ended disastrously. At liftoff, the Blok A core stage of the 11A57 booster ignited, but not the strap-ons. A shutdown command was immediately sent and pad crews began to move the service towers back in place and drain the propellants. This task was completed for the core stage and strap-ons, and then about 27 minutes after the attempted launch, the launch escape system (LES) suddenly fired. Its exhaust caused the Blok I third stage propellant tanks to overheat and explode, killing one person on the ground and damaging the Soyuz and core stage/strap-ons beyond repair. LC-31 was also badly damaged and took seven months of repair work in the frigid Kazakhstan winter to be restored to use. The reason for the LES firing was thought to be either a timer being activated due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation affecting the gyroscope package in the launch vehicle or perhaps one of the service towers bumping it.

== Launch ==
In February 1967, the backup booster and spacecraft were set up at LC-1 and the planned mission could be carried out. Kosmos 140 was operated in a low Earth orbit, on 7 February 1967, it had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 51.7°, and an orbital period of 88.5 minutes.

== Return ==
The spacecraft suffered attitude control problems and excessive fuel consumption in orbit, but remained controllable. An attempted maneuver on the 22nd orbit still showed problems with the control system. It malfunctioned yet again during retrofire, leading to a steeper than planned ballistic reentry and a hole being burned in the heat shield.

Although the event would have been lethal to any human occupants, the capsule&#x27;s recovery systems operated and the capsule crashed through the ice of the frozen Aral Sea, hundreds of kilometers short of its landing zone. The spacecraft finally sank in 10 metres of water and had to be retrieved by divers. The test performance was nonetheless deemed &quot;good enough&quot;; the crewed docking missions of Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 2 was approved for the next flight.

<text>Simon Emil Koedel (1881–1949) was a spy for Nazi Germany in World War II. Born in 1881 in Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany, and came to the US in 1904. Koedel enlisted in the US Army in 1908 and served until 1911, and in 1912 he became a US citizen. He began spying on American shipping for Germany, and in April 1915 headed for England via Holland. He spied on shipping in England and Scotland until he was arrested in Liverpool. After being deported back to the US, he headed to Germany in 1916 again via Holland. Koedel was then commissioned as a captain in the Germany Army and subsequently returned to the United States.

During World War II, Koedel used his stepdaughter, Marie Koedel, to spy on US and other seamen while in port in New York. He monitored American ports and US military suppliers. He obtained and forwarded to Germany volumes of information about US companies involved in the war effort over many years, but also about policy, decisions made and to come; information which he obtained by posing as a concerned citizen. He often wrote to Congressmen and other highly regarded persons who unwittingly helped him through otherwise closed doors.

The Koedels were both arrested in 1944. They were charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. In 1945, Simon pleaded guilty, while Marie was convicted at trial. During her trial, Marie, who claimed she acted under duress and her mother had said Simon had physically abused the two of them. Simon was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Marie was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison. Both avoided possible death sentences since their known spying activities happened before the United States entered the war.

<doc id="1065286" wikidata="Q533207" url="?curid=1065286" title="Sally Priesand">
<text>Sally Jane Priesand (born June 27, 1946) is America&#x27;s first female rabbi ordained by a rabbinical seminary, and the second formally ordained female rabbi in Jewish history, after Regina Jonas. Priesand was ordained by the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion on June 3, 1972, at the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati. After her ordination she served first as assistant and then as associate rabbi at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City, and later led Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls, New Jersey from 1981 until her retirement in 2006. She is featured in numerous books including &quot;Rabbis: The Many Faces of Judaism&quot; and &quot;Fifty Jewish Women who Changed the World&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Sally Jane Priesand was born June 27, 1946, in Cleveland, Ohio into a Jewish family. Her parents, Irving Theodore, an engineer, and Rose Elizabeth (Welch) Priesand were not religiously observant but they were active in Jewish organizations. Her mother served as president of the sisterhood of their temple, while her father was president of a B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith lodge. Her family lit Shabbat candles, celebrated Chanukah and had a Passover Seder to which the children were encouraged to invite a non-Jewish friend to share in the festivities and learn about Judaism. The family first attended a non-egalitarian Conservative synagogue, and later attended Beth Israel-West Temple, a Reform congregation on Cleveland&#x27;s West Side, where Priesand began to display a commitment to Judaism and Jewish life as a teenager. Priesand did not become Bat Mitzvah but was confirmed and continued her religious school education through the twelfth grade. At the age of 16, she decided she wanted to be a rabbi. She later described her decision to become a rabbi as &quot;an affirmation of my belief in God, in the worth of each individual, and in Judaism as a way of life.&quot;

While still in high school, she requested admission information from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati (HUC-JIR). In answer to her letter, the school responded: 

Entering the University of Cincinnati in 1964, she was accepted into the joint program of HUC-JIR and the University of Cincinnati. She graduated with a Bachelor of Hebrew Letters and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from HUC-JIR and the University of Cincinnati in 1968.

===Rabbinic school===
Upon her graduation, she was admitted to HUC-JIR&#x27;s rabbinic school without undergoing a formal application process, being the only woman among 35 men. While still in rabbinical school, she received a great deal of attention from the media. In April 1971, she was the subject of an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, titled &quot;Her Ambition Is to Become a Rabbi – And a Housewife&quot;, in which she stated: 

Despite opposition – many said she was at HUC-JIR to marry a rabbi and become a rebbetzin rather than to officiate as a rabbi – she became the first woman at Hebrew Union College to make it to ordination, an accomplishment she credits to her parents and to Rabbi Nelson Glueck, the college&#x27;s president who died a few months before her ordination.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2006/05/20&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

Her rabbinical thesis, &quot;Historic and Changing Role of the Jewish Woman&quot;, published in 1975 under the title &quot;Judaism and the New Woman&quot;, was intended to encourage women&#x27;s participation in Judaism.

It was only many years later that she learned her ordination certificate from HUC had different wording for her title than the certificates of men graduating with her. &quot;It came as a shock to me,&quot; she noted. &quot;When I was ordained I was told I would be getting an empty tube because they had forgotten to change the language to the feminine&quot; on the ordination scroll. &quot;I just accepted that. When I finally got it I thought the title, which they had changed to &#x27;rav u&#x27;morah,&#x27; was what all my classmates got, too.&quot; In actuality, male candidates&#x27; certificates identified them by the Reform movement&#x27;s traditional &quot;morenu harav,&quot; or &quot;our teacher the rabbi,&quot; while female candidates&#x27; certificates only used the term &quot;rav u&#x27;morah,&quot; or &quot;rabbi and teacher&quot;, up until 2016. After four years of deliberation, HUC decided to give women a choice of wording beginning in 2016, including the option to have the same wording as men.

==Career==
===Ordination===
Priesand was ordained on June 3, 1972, by Glueck&#x27;s successor as HUC-JIR&#x27;s president Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk at the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati, making her the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in the United States and believed to be only the second woman ever to be formally ordained in the history of Judaism.

Gottschalk called the ordination of Priesand &quot;historic&quot;, one that breaks stereotypes and allows &quot;Jewish women to consider seeking the rabbinate&quot; and a testament to Reform Judaism&#x27;s efforts at achieving &quot;equality of women in the congregation of the Lord&quot;. By acquiescing to women&#x27;s ordination at a time of social and political changes in American life, the Reform movement portrayed itself as continuing its historic project of adapting Judaism to respond to modernity while simultaneously demonstrating its commitment to women&#x27;s equality.

After her ordination, then member of Congress Bella Abzug arranged for her to deliver the opening prayer at the House of Representatives, making her the first Jewish woman to do so.

===Rabbinical positions===
Upon ordination, she was interviewed by some synagogues for her &quot;public value, so they could say they were first&quot;, as she says, but others would not speak to her, and she was the last of her class to get a job. She was offered a position at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City, where she served for seven years under Rabbi Edward Klein, first as Assistant Rabbi and then as Associate Rabbi, leaving the congregation in 1979, when she realised that she would not succeed Klein as senior rabbi. Not able to find a full-time position, she served as part-time rabbi of Temple Beth El in Elizabeth, New Jersey and as Chaplain at Manhattan&#x27;s Lenox Hill Hospital until 1981, when she became rabbi of Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. She originally thought her &quot;obligation was to get a bigger
congregation&quot;, but rejected the traditional model which encourages rabbis to look for larger pulpits and remained at Monmouth Reform Temple, a congregation of 365 families, where she &quot;forged a creative partnership with ... her congregation, acting upon her belief that a rabbi&#x27;s primary task is to help Jews take responsibility for their Judaism&quot;.

In 1986 at Monmouth Reform Temple, she and cantor Ellen Sussman became the first all-women team of rabbi and cantor in any congregation. Also during her rabbinate, Monmouth Reform Temple created a Social Action Committee which launched a nationally recognized gun safety campaign (Please ASK, which was given an award in 2003 by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism), was a leader in the fight against drunk driving, created a permanent Fund for the Homeless to support the work of Interfaith Neighbors, sponsored an annual food drive for The Center in Asbury Park, continued to host an annual Monmouth County arts festival, and instituted an annual &quot;Mitzvah Day&quot; of charitable volunteerism.

===Documentary appearance===
Priesand appeared in a 2005 documentary, titled &quot;And the Gates Opened: Women in the Rabbinate,&quot; which features stories of and interviews with her, rabbi Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, and rabbi Amy Eilberg.

===Health issues===
In 1987, Priesand was diagnosed with breast cancer, which struck again eight years later, and in 2003, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She was able to continue working during her treatments for breast cancer, but the thyroid cancer treatments forced her to take a three-month leave of absence. Her illness affected her rabbinate, making her &quot;more sensitive and aware of the needs of others who were dealing with health crises&quot;, she said.

===Organizational affiliations===
Priesand has served on the board of every major institution of Reform Judaism, including the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Union for Reform Judaism and the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. She is a member of Jewish Women International, Hadassah, the National Council of Jewish Women, the National Organization for Women and the National Breast Cancer Coalition. In her local community, she is an Honorary Vice President of the Jewish Federation of Greater Monmouth County and President of Interfaith Neighbors, an organization whose primary purpose is to provide rental assistance and support services for those who are homeless. She also chairs the Clergy Advisory Committee of Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey and serves on the board of the Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights Education Center at Brookdale Community College, and the Jewish Heritage Museum of Monmouth County.

==Retirement and current life==
Priesand retired from Monmouth Reform Temple on June 30, 2006, after 25 years of service to that congregation. She explained her retirement, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m retiring by choice, because I believe that rabbis should know when to leave and when it&#x27;s time to inject &#x27;newness&#x27; into synagogue life.&quot; She intends to remain &quot;a part of the temple family&quot; as rabbi emerita, adding &quot;being here has been the fulfillment of my dream to be a congregational rabbi, which is why I went to rabbinic school in the first place.&quot;
Upon her retirement, Monmouth Reform Temple set up the &quot;Sally Priesand Endowment Fund for the Future&quot; in her honor to preserve and protect the temple&#x27;s legacy.

Priesand lives in Ocean Township, New Jersey, with her Boston Terrier, Shadow. She intends to establish a Monmouth County kollel, a center for adult Jewish study. Her hobbies include photography and abstract watercolor. She had her first solo exhibition in the Backman Gallery at HUC-JIR in New York in 2002, in honor of the thirtieth anniversary of her ordination, and exhibits annually in the Monmouth Festival of the Arts.

In 2007, she invited her female rabbinic colleagues of all denominations to join her in donating their professional and personal papers to the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, Ohio, in order to document the history of women in the rabbinate. The first ever exhibit of the historical memorabilia of her career was displayed at the Jewish Heritage Museum of Monmouth County in the winter of 2010.

On December 6, 2010, at Temple Reyim in Newton, Massachusetts, Priesand and the other three first American ordained women rabbis of four denominations of American Judaism met for the first time in an event called &quot;First Lights&quot;, videotaped by the Los Angeles-based &quot;Story Archive of Women Rabbis&quot;, a project which videotapes interviews with women rabbis from all streams of Judaism and archives their stories online. Priesand together with Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, the first Reconstructionist female rabbi ordained in 1974, Amy Eilberg, the first Conservative female rabbi ordained in 1985, and Sara Hurwitz (see below), lit Chanuka candles together with some 30 other women rabbis, and then spoke about their experiences.

=== 40th anniversary of ordination ===
Priesand was honored in several events on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of her ordination in 2012.
In March 2012, the Annual Convention of the Central Conference of American Rabbis celebrated the 40th anniversary of women&#x27;s ordination by calling Priesand to the Torah at the Monday morning prayer service; through May 2012, the Union for Reform Judaism was running a blog to celebrate &quot;Forty Years of Women&quot; in honor of the anniversary; and Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion honored her as special guest at the June 2, 2012 ordination ceremony at Plum Street Temple, during which 13 candidates were ordained – eight of them women.
On the day of the anniversary on June 3, 2012, Priesand, Eisenberg Sasso, Eilberg, and Hurwitz met for a &quot;Four First Women Rabbis&quot; discussion at Monmouth Reform Temple for a celebration honoring the four first women rabbis ordained in North America in their respective denominations, and the 40th anniversary of Priesand&#x27;s ordination.

==== After her 40th ordination anniversary ====

In 2014 Priesand was one of those who attended the ceremony when a memorial plaque to Regina Jonas, the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi, was unveiled at Theresienstadt in the Czech Republic, where Regina Jonas had been deported to and worked in for two years. There is a short documentary about the trip on which this plaque was unveiled, titled &quot;In the Footsteps of Regina Jonas&quot;, which includes Priesand.

=== 50th anniversary of ordination ===
Two exhibits on the Cincinnati campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion marked the fiftieth anniversary of Priesand&#x27;s ordination; Priesand herself was the keynote speaker at the opening reception for them. One of those exhibits was the art exhibit “Holy Sparks”, which featured 24 Jewish women artists, who had each created an artwork about a female rabbi who was a first in some way. Joan Roth created the artwork about Priesand. The other exhibit, called &quot;Sally Priesand Paves the Way&quot;, featured &quot;documents relating to Rabbi Sally J. Priesand&#x27;s journey to becoming the first woman rabbi ordained in North America&quot;, and memorabilia and personal artifacts donated by Priesand.

The anniversary was also marked by a number of articles in various media outlets.

==Writings==
Priesand is the author of &quot;Judaism and the New Woman&quot;, and a contributor to &quot;Women Rabbis: Exploration and Celebration&quot;, and to &quot;A Treasury of Favorite Sermons by Leading American Rabbis&quot;. She also wrote the foreword to the book &quot;The Sacred Calling: Four Decades of Women in the Rabbinate&quot;, published in 2016, which contains one piece called &quot;Letters from Hebrew Union College to Sally J. Priesand&quot; and another called &quot;The Ordination of Sally J. Priesand, A Historic Interview&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
In 1973, Priesand was awarded an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Florida International University.

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; card number 6 featured Priesand&#x27;s name and picture.

From 1981 to 1983, Bonnie Tiburzi put on three “Women of Accomplishment” luncheons for the Wings Club honoring certain women, including Priesand.

In 1997, Priesand received an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR). In the same year, the Rabbi Sally J. Priesand Visiting Professorship in Jewish Women&#x27;s Studies was established in her honor at HUC-JIR.

In 2006, upon her retirement, Monmouth Reform Temple dedicated its sanctuary doors in her honor; they are inscribed with the following words, &quot;פִּתְחוּ לִי שַׁעֲרֵי צֶדֶק אָבֹא בָם אוֹדֶה יָהּ Open the gates of righteousness for me that I may enter and praise God.&quot;

Also in 2006 upon her retirement, Monmouth Reform Temple set up the &quot;Sally Priesand Endowment Fund for the Future&quot; in her honor to preserve and protect the temple&#x27;s legacy.

On April 23, 2009, she received the prestigious Elizabeth Blackwell Award given by Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York to women whose lives exemplify outstanding service to humanity. The award is named after Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (1821–1910), the first woman in America to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree.

In 2010, in honor of its 125th anniversary, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine named her one of &quot;125 women who changed our world&quot;.

In 2023, Priesand became the first female rabbi to have her portrait featured in an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. That portrait was an inkjet print of a photograph from 2022 by Joan Roth. 

The Rabbi Sally J. Priesand WRJ Award was created to honor the 45th anniversary of Priesand&#x27;s ordination. The award is given out once every year to a graduating Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Cincinnati campus woman, chosen because she &quot;exemplif[ies] the mission and values of WRJ and embod[ies] the qualities that Rabbi Priesand has exhibited throughout her career, including her clarity of vision, her commitment to excellence, her professionalism, her dedication to the continuity of Reform Judaism, her passion, and her perseverance.

The poem “Let my people go that we may serve You”, by Merle Feld, was commissioned by the Women&#x27;s Rabbinic Network in honor of Priesand.

<doc id="1065289" wikidata="Q3038272" url="?curid=1065289" title="River Dove, central England">
<text>The River Dove ( , ) is the principal river of the southwestern Peak District, in the Midlands of England, and is around in length. It rises on Axe Edge Moor near Buxton and flows generally south to its confluence with the River Trent at Newton Solney. From there, its waters reach the North Sea via the Humber Estuary. For almost its entire course it forms the boundary between the counties of Staffordshire (to the west) and Derbyshire (to the east). The river meanders past Longnor and Hartington and cuts through a set of deep limestone gorges, Beresford Dale, Wolfscote Dale, Milldale and Dovedale.

The river is a famous trout stream. Charles Cotton&#x27;s Fishing House, which was the inspiration for Izaak Walton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, stands in the woods by the river near Hartington.

The river&#x27;s name is now usually pronounced to rhyme with &quot;love&quot;, but its original pronunciation rhymed with &quot;rove&quot;. This pronunciation is still used by some residents of the lower reaches of the river.

==Dovedale==

From Hartington to its confluence with the River Manifold at Ilam, the river flows through a series of scenic limestone valleys, known collectively as Dovedale. Dovedale is also particularly used for the name of that section between the stepping stones under Thorpe Cloud and Milldale. The Dovedale gorge is considered so scenic that it attracts a million visitors a year. Good riverside paths make the whole route accessible to walkers.

Much of the dale is in the ownership of the National Trust, being part of their South Peak Estate. Dovedale itself was acquired in 1934, with successive properties being added until 1938, and Wolfscote Dale in 1948. Dovedale was declared a national nature reserve in 2006.

Dovedale&#x27;s attractions include rock pillars such as Ilam Rock, Viator&#x27;s Bridge, and the limestone features Lovers&#x27; Leap and Reynard&#x27;s Cave.

==Lower Dove==
Once the river leaves Dovedale it combines with the Manifold and enters a wider valley near Thorpe. The valley increases in size as the river continues south to reach Mapleton and then Mayfield, where it is crossed by the medieval Hanging Bridge. At this point it is joined by the Bentley Brook, and then nearby at Church Mayfield, by the Henmore Brook.

The Dove now flows in a south-westerly direction, passing Norbury and Ellastone, where it turns south until it reaches Rocester. To the south of the village, at Combridge it is joined by its largest tributary the River Churnet. As it reaches the ancient Dove Bridge, it is joined by the River Tean, the river now meandering through a wide valley which turns east as it passes between Doveridge and Uttoxeter; the only town along its length.

Beyond this point riverside communities, such as Marchington, Sudbury and Scropton, tend to be located at the edge of the valley; although the village of Hatton encroaches across the valley floor, where it is linked by a bridge to Tutbury whose Castle overlooks the crossing. The river continues east passing the villages of Marston, Rolleston on Dove and Egginton, where it is joined by its last tributary, the Hilton Brook. The river is divided at this point, with some flow passing through the mill fleam at Clay Mills, the two arms rejoin downstream of the A38 road bridge and Monks Bridge, and then to the south, the Dove reaches its confluence with the River Trent, at Newton Solney.

<text>Murray Cotterill (June 27, 1913 – February 23, 1995) was a Canadian trade union activist and organizer for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).

In the 1930s, Cotterill was one of the organisers of the Co-operative Commonwealth Youth Movement. In the 1940s he was a CCF municipal candidate in Toronto and, in 1942, ran for the leadership of the Ontario CCF, losing to Ted Jolliffe. He was also an aide to Charles Millard in organizing the Steel Workers Organizing Committee and was active in rooting out Communists in the fledgling Steelworkers union and was the union&#x27;s public relations director for many years. Cotterill was also president of the Toronto Labour Council of the Canadian Congress of Labour (one of two labour councils in the city) in the late 1940s. He worked as a labour relations specialist for the Canadian Congress of Labour and its successor the Canadian Labour Congress and was for a time in the 1940s and 1950s the director of the CCL&#x27;s national Political Action Committee, a position he used to encourage closer ties between the labour movement and the CCF. Cotterill was also the leading force in the OFL&#x27;s Political Action Committee which helped create an informal alliance between the CCF and the labour movement that later led to the formation of the New Democratic Party as a formal CLC-CCF project.

In the 1963 provincial election he was the NDP&#x27;s candidate in the suburban Toronto riding of Lakeshore losing to Progressive Conservative Alan Eagleson.

In late 1963, Cotterill was involved with what were described as &quot;secret&quot; negotiations with John Wintermeyer, outgoing leader of the Ontario Liberal Party and various federal Liberals in pursuit of co-operation between the two parties and even their eventual fusion. Cotterill was reportedly offered the vice-presidency of the Ontario Liberal Party but declined. The talks ended due to the opposition of Ontario NDP leader Donald C. MacDonald. Several leading Ontario Liberals also came out against the talks when they learned of them.

From 1940 until his retirement in 1972, Cotterill worked as public relations director of the Canadian Steelworkers and was also an occasional columnist for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. He was a vocal opponent of the Waffle, a left-wing faction within the NDP in the early 1970s and called for the group to be disbanded or expelled from the party.

In retirement, Cotterill moved to Saskatchewan and spent two years working for the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party government of Allan Blakeney.

<text>Rawa (Rawicz), is a coat of arms of Polish origin. It was borne by several noble families of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russian Empire and Ukraine.

The ancestry of first bearers of Rawicz (the Rawici clan) is debated. Version supported by Polish chronicler Jan Długosz points out branch of Czech (Bohemian) Vršovci clan, version supported by Polish heraldist Kasper Niesiecki (as better) says that their origin is pagan Polish.

Lot of families were later legally adopted into the clan or ennobled with this coat of arms, some misattributed to the clan by similarity of arms, names or by simple error or usurpation.

Nowadays it (or its modification) is used as coat of arms of several Polish settlements.

==Blazon==
Main version (in others colours may differ):

Shield Or (gold) with a bear (probably &quot;ursus arctos&quot;) Sable (black) facing dexter (right) with a maiden on its back. The maiden, vested in royal attire Gules (red) and a crown Or, with flowing hair and hands upraised a little and expanded, all proper. Out of the crest coronet, between two antlers proper, a bear facing dexter. His left arm in front is lowered, and another one holds a rose on a stem, all proper, which the bear carries to his snout.

==History==

=== Power struggles in Bohemia: damnation, prosecution and salvation ===
The Vršovci (whose branch was probably the root of some Rawicz bearers) took part in cruel power struggles that occurred in Bohemia on the turn of the first millennium. Together with Přemyslids led by Boleslaus II the Pious they rivalised with Slavniki clan. During the struggles five members of rival Slavniki clan: Soběbor, Spytimír, Pobraslav, Pořej, and Čáslav were murdered. They were brothers of Czech missionary and bishop st. Adalbert of Prague (, ). In 995 he damned the murderers(Vršovci).

In historical records Czech duke Svatopluk of Přemyslids clan is accused of ordering to kill Mutyna and two his sons: Bożej and Boraszek also Unisław and Domisław (all of them belonged to the Vršovci family) during similar power struggles thirteen years later.

Being horrified by those events some of Vršovci fled to Poland, where they were received with honours by king Bolesław III Krzywousty who gave them lands in the duchy of Masovia, that were foundation of future Rawa Voivodeship.

=== Origin of Polish Rawici ===
Rawicz is an old coat of arms, one of the oldest used in Poland. According to the legend it was imported from Lorraine (where it is first mentioned in 1003) prior to 1109. 
According to a legend, the symbol was brought to Lorraine from England, where it was awarded to the descendants of Canute the Great.

The ancestry of first bearers of Rawicz (the Rawici clan) is debated:

* version supported by Polish chronicler Jan Długosz points out one of branches of Czech (Bohemian) Vršovci clan, Early history of Vršovci is described by Cosmas of Prague in &quot;Chronicle of Bohemians&quot;.
* version supported by Polish heraldist Kasper Niesiecki (as better) says that their origin is pagan Polish.

=== Participation in the Battle of Grunwald ===
In 1410 Rawicz bearers took part in the Battle of Grunwald. Among 50 Polish gonfalons (regiments) one (the 26th) took the field under Rawa coat of arms and was led by Christian of Ostrów, Kraków castellan. He was also a war councilor, one of the seven chief members of General Headquarters of Władysław II Jagiełło. In addition, one of the Rawicz bearers is marked for his military valour in the Battle of Koronowo that occurred shortly after the Grunwald. This knight&#x27;s name was Christian of Goworzici, Rawa coat of arms.

&quot;(Jan Długosz, Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae)&quot;

== Legend ==
According to the legend, an English king died without leaving a properly perfected testament, so his last will was expressed from the world beyond. He left a crown and all immovable property to his son, and all movables – to his daughter. Being instigated by his councilors, the Prince decided to fulfill his father&#x27;s will nominally. He ordered to drive a black bear (which undoubtedly was a unit of king&#x27;s movable property) to a Princess&#x27; bedchamber. In case of Princess&#x27; death that seemed inevitable, the King&#x27;s wish would be fulfilled and Princess&#x27; failure to manage the movables would be proven. However, the Princess did not only tame the beast but even rode out her chamber on its back, upraising her hands and calling for justice. Her brother made sure that truth and heaven take sister&#x27;s side. He asked her pardon and married her off to a Duke of Lorraine, with all due property as a portion. As a keepsake Princess gave her descendants a coat of arms with a girl riding a bear depicted on it. This coat of arms was called &quot;Rawicz&quot;. It symbolizes ability to overcome difficulties with honour, to change confusion into victory.

This legend is stated in a well-known Polish armorial &quot;Orbis Polonus&quot; assembled by Szymon Okolski in 1641–1643.

<text>Półkozic is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
According to legend, this coat was assigned to knight Stawisz, who was defending the foreign castle of Etecz (or Eczech) against the pagans. When besieged, he ordered to kill a goat and a donkey, and then use their blood to paint ox&#x27;s hide. With this hide he then ordered to decorate the walls of the castle. The pagans, seeing that defenders had so much meat as to waste it, lifted the siege and left. The knight was rewarded by the king Bolesław I Chrobry with a coat of arms and returned to Poland.

The bearers of the coat were mentioned since early Piast era. Initially they were tied to the land of Lesser Poland, (regions of Sandomierz and Kraków), regions near Lublin, Rawa Mazowiecka, Sieradz and then Red Ruthenia. After the Union of Horodło bearers of the coat of arms appeared also in Lithuania.

==Blazon==
Gules, donkeys head gardant Argent. Over the helm the crest composed of a goat passant proper Argent.

* House of Ligęza
* Jan son of Pakosław (owner of Rzeszów)- a valued diplomat of king Casimir III in many diplomatic missions including mission to pope Urban V
* Marcin of Wrocimowice - Standard-Bearer of the Territory of Kraków in the Battle of Grunwald

<text>Jacob van Campen (2 February 1596 — 13 September 1657) was a Dutch artist and architect of the Golden Age.

==Life==
He was born into a wealthy family at Haarlem and spent his youth in his hometown. Being of noble birth and with time on his hands, he took up painting mainly as a pastime. In 1614, he became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke (in Haarlem the architects and painters were both in the same guild, and many were both, such as Pieter Saenredam and Salomon de Bray), and studied painting under Frans de Grebber — a number of Van Campen&#x27;s oils survive. About 1616 to 1624 he is thought to have lived in Italy. On his return to the Netherlands, Van Campen turned to architecture, applying ideas borrowed from Andrea Palladio, Vincenzo Scamozzi, and classical influences from Vitruvius. He was primarily responsible for introducing the classical revival style into Dutch Baroque architecture, combining the native, Dutch brick style with the Vitruvian principles he had learnt to produce &quot;Dutch Classicism&quot;, an internationally influential style.

Van Campen was friendly with Constantijn Huygens, and together they designed a new house for Huygens. Even after Van Campen&#x27;s death, his work greatly influenced Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, the designer of the Kleefse gardens (the gardens of Cleve), and on Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. The latter owned a book by Van Campen regardless of the expense. The city hall and city palace of Potsdam owe a debt to ideas by Van Campen.

Van Campen&#x27;s first known building was the Coymans house built in 1625 in Amsterdam. In the 1630s, Van Campen and Pieter Post designed the Mauritshuis in The Hague, a palace that is now home to a Royal Picture Gallery, and Van Campen alone designed the Netherlands&#x27; first theatre, Amsterdam&#x27;s Stadsschouwburg. About 1645 Van Campen designed the Nieuwe Kerk in Haarlem, a church that influenced Christopher Wren. His best-known work is probably the large Town Hall of Amsterdam (begun 1648), now the Royal Palace in Dam Square.

Van Campen worked as an architect, a painter and a designer of decorative schemes, like that for the church organ in Alkmaar. His art also influenced sculpture. He was assisted in his work by Pieter Post, Daniël Stalpaert, Matthias Withoos, Philips Vingboons, Artus Quellinus, Tielman van Gameren and Rombout Verhulst. During the building of the city hall, Van Campen lived in very expensive lodgings in the nearby Kalverstraat and he spent freely. In 1654 Van Campen (and Willem de Keyser left after an argument, probably in connection with the design of the barrel vaults. Stalpaert won, but his completion of the project was reported to be less fine than Van Campen&#x27;s designs.

After a long career, Van Campen died in 1657 in his buitenplaats (residence) &quot;Randenbroek&quot; near Amersfoort, which he had inherited from his mother, and was buried there. He had expanded it himself and had it decorated by Caesar van Everdingen. Van Campen never married but had one son, Alexander Van Campen.

==Designs==
Van Campen was selective in what projects he took on. His best known works are: 
*The Royal Palace, Amsterdam, former city hall. In 1647, his name is mentioned for the first time in connection with the design of the new city hall. It was to be a perfect building, perfect in its proportions and in the message it conveyed to the spectator. Its power lies in its strict and perfect proportions and extremely moderate decoration. Critics loathed the simple entrance - without stairs - on the ground floor.
*He is suspected to have had a hand in the alteration of the Rembrandthuis at the Jodenbreestraat in Amsterdam (1627), and in the design of the castle Drakensteyn at Baarn
*The Mauritshuis in The Hague (1633).
*the Theatre of Van Campen (1638), based on the example of Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza, in Amsterdam.
*the Paleis Noordeinde, a royal palace in The Hague (1640).

As well as houses and palaces, he also designed a number of churches, such as those at Renswoude and at Hooge Zwaluwe, and the Nieuwe Kerk in Haarlem. Of that design, Pieter Saenredam made no fewer than three paintings and eight engravings. Furthermore, Van Campen designed gates and towers, e.g. for the Westerkerk and Nieuwe Kerk, both in Amsterdam. His paintings and wall decorations (such as those at Paleis Huis ten Bosch), show some similarity with the work of Paulus Bor, one of the founders of a group of painters calling themselves the Bentvueghels.

<text>Link encryption is an approach to communications security that encrypts and decrypts all network traffic at each network routing point (e.g. network switch, or node through which it passes) until arrival at its final destination. This repeated decryption and encryption is necessary to allow the routing information contained in each transmission to be read and employed further to direct the transmission toward its destination, before which it is re-encrypted. This contrasts with [[end-to-end encryption]] where internal information, but not the header/routing information, is encrypted by the sender at the point of origin and only decrypted by the intended recipient.

Link encryption offers two main advantages:
* encryption is automatic so there is less opportunity for human error.
* if the communications link operates continuously and carries an unvarying level of traffic, link encryption defeats traffic analysis.

On the other hand, end-to-end encryption ensures only the intended recipient has access to the plaintext. Link encryption can be used with end-to-end systems by superencrypting the messages. Bulk encryption refers to encrypting a large number of circuits at once, after they have been multiplexed.

<text>The Generic Access Profile (GAP) (ETSI standard EN 300 444) describes a set of mandatory requirements to allow any conforming DECT Fixed Part (base) to interoperate with any conforming DECT Portable Part (handset) to provide basic telephony services when attached to a 3.1 kHz telephone network (as defined by EN 300 176-2).

The objective of GAP is to ensure interoperation at the air interface (i.e., the radio connection) and at the level of procedures to establish, maintain and release telephone calls (Call Control). GAP also mandates procedures for registering Portable Parts to a Fixed Part (Mobility Management). A GAP-compliant handset from one manufacturer should work, at the basic level of making calls, with a GAP-compliant base from another manufacturer, although it may be unable to access advanced features of the base station such as phone book synchronization or remote operation of an answering machine. Most consumer-level DECT phones and base stations support the GAP profile, even those that do not publicize the feature, and thus can be used together. However some manufacturers lock their systems to prevent interoperability, or supply bases that cannot register new handsets.

The GAP does not describe how the Fixed Part is connected to the external telephone network.

<text>Ogończyk is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

Although the coat of arms was first mentioned in an armorial of 1384, it is probable that it stems from early mediaeval Slavic signs for marking the cattle. After the Union of Horodło of 1413 several Lithuanian boyar families were adopted to it. With time it also spread to Prussia, where several Germanized families used it.

==Blazon==

Gules, half an argent arrow heading upwards, supported by half of a ring. Out of the crest coronet two bare maiden hands (sometimes armed hands), holding a ring, all proper.

<text>Odrowąż is a Polish coat of arms of probably Moravian origin. It was used by many noble families known as &quot;szlachta&quot; in Polish in medieval Poland and later under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, branches of the original medieval Odrowążowie family as well as families connected with the Clan by adoption.

==History==
Okolski tells that the progenitor of this clan cut off both halves of the moustache of an adversary at a jousting match, and the flesh with it, with the arrow. Bogdan Balbin in notes to Epitome &quot;Rerum Bohemicarum&quot; [Summary of Bohemian Affairs], chapter 15, calls the arms of the Odrowaz family Sagitta circumflexa [&quot;bent arrow&quot;], and adds that some of the earliest houses in Bohemia bore these arms, of whom Tobias was Bishop of Prague, during the times of Premysl Otakar II. In German the arms are known as a &quot;Bartausreisser&quot;

== Blazon ==
Arms: Gules, an arrow in pale point to chief, the base double sarcelled and counter embowed, Argent. Out of a crest coronet a panache of peacock plumes proper, charged with the arms in fess. The shield is red, upon which is a silver arrow pointing upward, and the bottom is divided and curved on both ends. Out of a helmeted crown is a display of peacock plumes, upon which can be seen lying on its side 
the device as pictured on the shield.

The tinctures (colors) are: azure = blue; gules = red; sable = black; or = gold; argent = silver; vert = green. In heraldry all charges (pictures) on a shield are assumed to be facing dexter (right side).

<doc id="1065326" wikidata="Q936364" url="?curid=1065326" title="Édouard Deldevez">
<text>Édouard Marie Ernest Deldevez (31 May 1817 – 6 November 1897) was a French violinist, conductor at important Parisian musical institutions, composer, and music teacher.

==Biography==
Deldevez was born and died in Paris. He won many prizes as a violinist. He progressed from violinist at the Paris Opera to conductor. He was principal conductor of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire from 1872 to 1885.

At the Paris Opéra-Comique Deldevez conducted the revival of &quot;La Fille du Regiment&quot; (with Marie Cabel) in 1857, &quot;Rose et Colas&quot; (first performance at the theatre, as well as 50th performance in 1862), the premiere of &quot;Lalla-Roukh&quot; on 12 May 1862, the first production at the Salle Favart of &quot;La Servante maîtresse&quot; on 12 August 1862 (Galli-Marié&#x27;s debut at the house), runs of &quot;La dame blanche&quot; (including the 1,000th performance there in December 1862), &quot;Le pré aux clercs&quot;, &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; (including the 500th performance in March 1863), and a revival of &quot;Joseph&quot; in 1866.

At the Paris Opera, Deldevez conducted &quot;La Juive&quot; at the opening night of the Palais Garnier in 1875, and the premiere of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot; in 1877, along with revivals of &quot;La Favorite&quot;, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, &quot;Le Prophète&quot; and &quot;Robert le Diable&quot;.

In 1867, Deldevez published his &quot;Notation de la musique classique&quot;. He wrote a number of other books and became a chevalier of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur in 1874. He published his memoires in 1890.

Some confusion exists concerning his name, which is occasionally misclassified as &quot;Ernest&quot;, though not in reliable sources of the period. One source records the name as &quot;Edmé Édouard Deldevez.&quot; The standard French edition of his musicological works reedited in 1998 and 2005 by Jean-Philippe Navarre gives only &quot;Édouard-Marie-Ernest Deldevez.&quot;

==The Sudre theory==
Deldevez became part of a group of musicians around François Sudre (1787–1864) who were attempting to develop a way of transmitting language through music. Sudre trained Deldevez and Charles Larsonneur to play and interpret his alphabet. A given note would represent a word or a letter of the alphabet. The trio toured France, answering questions from the audience using Sudre&#x27;s violin. A military application quickly presented itself. A bugler on a battlefield could transmit orders to a regiment by playing an appropriate tune. This promising hypothesis came to nothing because the system was too vulnerable to wind and weather.

Clearly grasping at straws, Sudre then offered the military a set of musical canons, but they declined the suggestion. In 1829, Sudre began to develop the system that is now known as the Do Re Mi method of notating music.

==Works==
His compositions include the operas &quot;Lionel Foscari&quot; (1841), &quot;Le Violon enchanté&quot; (1848), &quot;L&#x27;Éventail&quot; (1854), and &quot;La Ronde des sorcières&quot;, along with several lyric scenes and ballets.

His &quot;Messe de Requiem&quot;, Op. 7 is dedicated to the memory of Berton, Chérubini, and Habeneck.

Other works include &quot;Six Songs Without Words&quot; for piano, &quot;Three Piano Preludes&quot;, three-part hymns, and a cantata performed at the Paris Opera on 15 February 1853.

Deldevez also wrote the original score for the ballet &quot;Paquita&quot; (Paris, 1846). However, an 1881 revival by Marius Petipa included additional numbers by Ludwig Minkus (1826–1917), and this score is more widely known and used.

<text>Mahalaxmi (Pronunciation: ; station code: MX), also spelled Mahalakshmi, is a railway station on the Western Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway in Mahalaxmi, Mumbai. Trains starting from pass through Mahalaxmi. The next station south is Mumbai Central Station, while the next station north is Lower Parel Station. Major landmarks in the area are the Mahalaxmi Temple, Haji Ali Dargah, Nehru Planetarium and Mahalaxmi Racecourse Dabbawalla Statue. Worli Seaface is also close from here. Byculla station of the Central Railway is the closest station.

The Saat Rasta Project will connect the Mahalaxmi railway station to the proposed Jacob Circle monorail station.The Haji Ali Mahalaxmi Project aims to connect the 225-acre Mahalaxmi Racecourse to the Arabian Sea, by creating a 6-acre public open space.

==History==
Until the 1920s, the station had just been a siding to transport refuse. In view of the expected weekend crowds for the races at the nearby Race Course, the station had to be redeveloped. Renovation was carried out in 1926, and the station was reopened on 3 October 1926. The station then received am overbridge, a 150 ft (45.72 m) long platform dedicated for races, and 300 ft (91.44 m) long island platforms as well. On 5 January 1928, the Mahalaxmi station welcomed guests for the ceremony for the electrification of the BB&amp;CI Line. The then Governor of Bombay, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, opened the line to public from the station, in front of 700 invitees. He traveled on the inaugural train till Andheri.

A workshop was established at Mahalaxmi in 1910 for the repair of wagons. In 1962 it was modified to work on carriages, and in 1976 it was adapted for Periodic Overhauls of EMUs.

<text>Victor Steinbrueck Park is a 0.8 acre (3,000 m²) park in Downtown Seattle, Washington, United States, located just northwest of Pike Place Market overlooking Elliott Bay. Named for the Seattle-based architect Victor Steinbrueck, it is positioned between Western Avenue and Alaskan Way at the foot of Virginia Street.

==History==
The park overlaps the former site of the Washington National Guard Armory, which was originally built around 1909 and damaged by fire in 1962 at a time when the future of the Market itself was a contentious issue. It was eventually torn down in 1968. Victor Steinbrueck, who was instrumental in the preservation of nearby Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square, wrote of the location in 1968: &quot;One of the grandest downtown lookout places is at Western Avenue where it meets Pike Place and Virginia Street. It has been neglected by the city and its possibilities for enjoyment are ignored except by a few habitués and passing pedestrians.&quot; Steinbrueck was strongly opposed to the demolition of the armory. &quot;Buildings like this,&quot; he wrote, &quot;(and there are very few) offer an irreplaceable tie with the past as well as adding variety and interest to new surroundings. Restoration is not at all impossible or difficult for sympathetic designers. Others can always find practical reasons for destruction.&quot;

The city purchased the land in 1968, demolished the remnant of the armory, and transferred ownership to the parks department in 1970. The park was landscaped in 1982 as Market Park. Two cedar totem poles, designed by Marvin Oliver and carved by James Bender, were added in 1984. After Steinbrueck&#x27;s death in 1985, the park was renamed after him. His son Peter Steinbrueck, also an architect, would later serve on the Seattle City Council from 1997 to 2007. The totem poles, which do not have indigenous meaning or significance, may be removed.

In December 2022, the park closed for a two-year renovation project to repair the waterproofing membrane under the park, which had deteriorated and leaked water into the parking garage below. The project will also include new furnishings, a replacement pavilion, and upgraded lighting. The park is scheduled to reopen in late 2024, more than several months behind schedule. A modified plan released in December 2023 would permanently replace the totem poles with indigenous sculptures from members of the Suquamish and Muckleshoot tribes. The Pike Place Market Historical Commission rejected the plan and required the restoration of the original totem poles. The renovations were completed in late 2024, but the park&#x27;s reopening was delayed due to the ongoing dispute with the commission.

<text>Calcinosis is the formation of calcium deposits in any soft tissue. It is a rare condition that has many different causes. These range from infection and injury to systemic diseases like kidney failure.

==Types==
===Dystrophic calcification===
The most common type of calcinosis is dystrophic calcification. This type of calcification can occur as a response to any soft tissue damage, including that involved in implantation of medical devices.

===Metastatic calcification===
Metastatic calcification involves a systemic calcium excess imbalance, which can be caused by hypercalcemia, kidney failure, milk-alkali syndrome, lack or excess of other minerals, or other causes.

===Tumoral calcinosis===
The cause of the rare condition of tumoral calcinosis is not entirely understood. It is generally characterized by large, globular calcifications near joints.

<text>Sir Mathew Alexander Thorpe (born 30 July 1938) is a retired Lord Justice of Appeal, who served as one of the judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales from 1995 to 2013.

==Education==

Thorpe was educated at Stowe School and Balliol College, Oxford.

==Legal career==
Thorpe was called to the bar (Inner Temple) in 1961 and was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1980. He was appointed a Recorder in 1982. He was appointed a High Court judge on 11 April 1988, assigned to the Family Division, and received the customary knighthood. He was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal on 2 October 1995. Thorpe was appointed Deputy Head of Family Justice and Head of International Justice in January 2005. He retired on 31 July 2013

==Jurisprudence==
He has presided over a number of important cases which have influenced the evolution of family law. He is regarded as a traditionalist in respect of parenting role but as a reactionary by his detractors.

1. Roles of men and women &quot;Re: S (Children) [2002] EWCA Civ 583&quot;

This case concerned a divorce where the mother had a high salary and the father stayed at home to look after the children under a shared parenting arrangement. If residence had been awarded to the father, the status quo in London would continue. However, if residence were awarded to the mother then she would move with the children to Linlithgow in Scotland. It was submitted on behalf of the father that it would be gender discrimination to decide residence in favour of the mother: if the roles were to be reversed, a father who proposed to abandon a lucrative career with the consequence that his wife and children would suffer a dramatic downturn in the standard of living, would not have the smallest chance of being given a residence order as his reward. This submission was rejected by Thorpe LJ on grounds of gender role:

:&quot;That submission seems to me to ignore the realities, namely the very different role and functions of men and women, and the reality that those who sacrifice the opportunity to provide full-time care for their children in favour of a highly competitive professional race do, not uncommonly, question the purpose of all that striving, and question whether they should not re-evaluate their life before the children have grown too old to benefit.&quot;

2. Leave to remove from the jurisdiction

This refers to the situation where the court must decide whether to grant permission to a parent who wants to take the children to live in another jurisdiction in the face of opposition from the other parent. It means that a parent (invariably the father) who continued to live in the UK would no longer have access to his children.

In &quot;Payne v Payne (2001) 2 WLR 1826&quot;, Thorpe LJ found that unilateral relocation cases had been consistently decided over 30 years upon the application of the following two propositions:

:(a) the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration; and
:(b) refusing the primary carer’s reasonable proposals for the relocation of her family life is likely to impact detrimentally on the welfare of her dependent children. Therefore her application to relocate will be granted unless the court concludes that it is incompatible with the welfare of the children.

Applying these principles, the Payne child was allowed to be taken to New Zealand by the mother since otherwise the effect on her of being forced to stay in England would be &quot;devastating&quot;. This approach was followed again later in &quot;Re: B (Children) (Removal from Jurisdiction); Re: S (A Child) (Removal from Jurisdiction) (2003) (2003) 2 FLR 1043&quot;. Thorpe LJ said, in connection with two cases involving children being removed to Australia and South Africa respectively, that to frustrate &quot;&quot;natural emigration&quot; risked the survival of the new family or blighted its potential for &quot;fulfilment and happiness&quot;&quot;. He said,
Often there will be a price to be paid in welfare terms by the diminution of the children&#x27;s contact with their father and his extended family

He said that it was also possible for a father to take employment abroad after separation or to marry a foreigner and there would be the same loss of contact:

These are the tides of chance and life and in the exercise of its paternalistic jurisdiction it is important that the court should recognise the force of these movements and not frustrate them unless they are shown to be contrary to the welfare of the child.

==Child protection==
Thorpe was appointed in 2010 to head a working party of the General Medical Council to consider and offer advice to doctors on matters relating to child protection.

==Driving disqualification and reprimand==
Thorpe was disqualified from driving and then, in January 2012, was reprimanded by the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice, both for receiving the ban and for failing to adhere to the guidance regarding the reporting of traffic offences.

<doc id="1065347" wikidata="Q2090859" url="?curid=1065347" title="Łodzia coat of arms">
<text>Łodzia (obsolete Polish for &quot;boat&quot;) is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by many noble families of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. A variant serves as the coat of arms of the city of Łódź (the city&#x27;s name literally means &quot;Boat&quot;). It is a classic example of the so-called &quot;canting arms&quot; well known in European heraldry as it was borne by the medieval lords de Łodzia (a feudal lordship) and their clan. Hence the boat in the shield, clearly alluding to the estate&#x27;s name literally meaning &quot;Boat&quot;. Coats of Arms in the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth were a symbol of a heraldic clan.

==History==

&quot;Łodzia&quot; is one of the oldest Polish coats of arms. Its earliest appearance (1303) is on a seal belonging to Wojciech of Krośno, Palatine of Kalisz. The first blazon description dates from 1411.

The first &quot;Łodzia&quot; coat of arms featured a golden letter M on the shield, and a boat in the crest. That version was used by Mikołaj of Łodzia in 1301. By 1315, however, all the bearers of the coat of arms had adopted the version used by Wojciech of Krośno. Initially the coat of arms had a checkerboard background, which by 1382 had been supplanted by a plain red field.

Until the 16th century, variously shaped boats were depicted. After the publication of Bartosz Paprocki&#x27;s &quot;Herby rycerstwa polskiego&quot; (The Coats-of-Arms of Polish Chivalry, 1584), most authors adopted the present version. Paprocki was also the first to mention the crest as comprising peacock feathers with boat superimposed.

The &quot;Łodzia&quot; coat of arms was used by over 150 families, mostly around Kalisz, Poznań and Sieradz. After the Union of Horodło, it was also adopted by several Lithuanian families.

==Blazon==
Gules, a rudderless and mastless boat Or.

<doc id="1065352" wikidata="Q347164" url="?curid=1065352" title="Leonnatus">
<text>Leonnatus (; 356 BC – 322 BC) was a Macedonian officer of Alexander the Great and one of the &quot;diadochi.&quot;

He was a member of the royal house of Lyncestis, a small Greek kingdom that had been included in Macedonia by King Philip II of Macedon. Leonnatus served under Philip II as one of his bodyguards, or somatophylakes. Shortly after Philip II was assassinated by Pausanias, Leonnatus helped kill Pausanius while he attempted to flee. Leonnatus was the same age as Alexander and was very close to him. Later, he was one of Alexander&#x27;s seven bodyguards. After Alexander died in 323 BC, the regent, Perdiccas, made Leonnatus satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia.

Diodorus (Book XVII.37-38) tells us that during the Battle of Issus, the immediate family of Darius had been captured by the Macedonian Army. Darius&#x27; family was hysterical that they would suffer a dreadful fate. However, Leonnatus was able to explain to them, on behalf of Alexander, that this would not be the case. In fact, Alexander promised to respect them as royalty, increase their household servants and to raise Darius&#x27; 6-year-old boy as his own.

He crushed the rebellion of Oritians in India, while losing only a few men.

Alexander&#x27;s sister Cleopatra, the widow of King Alexander I of Epirus, offered her hand to Leonnatus. When the Athenians heard that Alexander had died, they revolted against Macedonia and the new regent, Antipater. Leonnatus led an army of 20,000 infantry with 1,500 cavalry to relieve Antipater during the siege in Lamia (see Lamian War). He intervened probably with the ambition to usurp Antipater&#x27;s power. A victory in battle against the Athenians would have certainly enhanced his claim to the throne. Leonnatus was killed in battle against the Athenians and his marriage with Cleopatra never took place.

<doc id="1065357" wikidata="Q2895596" url="?curid=1065357" title="Mental status examination">
<text>The mental status examination (MSE) is an important part of the clinical assessment process in neurological and psychiatric practice. It is a structured way of observing and describing a patient&#x27;s psychological functioning at a given point in time, under the domains of appearance, attitude, behavior, mood and affect, speech, thought process, thought content, perception, cognition, insight, and judgment. There are some minor variations in the subdivision of the MSE and the sequence and names of MSE domains.

The purpose of the MSE is to obtain a comprehensive cross-sectional description of the patient&#x27;s mental state, which, when combined with the biographical and historical information of the psychiatric history, allows the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis and formulation, which are required for coherent treatment planning.

The data are collected through a combination of direct and indirect means: unstructured observation while obtaining the biographical and social information, focused questions about current symptoms, and formalised psychological tests.

The MSE is not to be confused with the mini–mental state examination (MMSE), which is a brief neuropsychological screening test for dementia.

==Theoretical foundations==
The MSE derives from an approach to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed from the work of the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers&#x27; perspective it was assumed that the only way to comprehend a patient&#x27;s experience is through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes the analyst might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.

In practice, the MSE is a blend of empathic descriptive phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term &quot;phenomenology&quot; has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient&#x27;s subjective experience.

==Application==
The mental status examination is a core skill of qualified (mental) health personnel. It is a key part of the initial psychiatric assessment in an outpatient or psychiatric hospital setting.
It is a systematic collection of data based on observation of the patient&#x27;s behavior while the patient is in the clinician&#x27;s view during the interview. The purpose is to obtain evidence of symptoms and signs of mental disorders, including danger to self and others, that are present at the time of the interview. Further, information on the patient&#x27;s insight, judgment, and capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and the choice of an appropriate treatment setting.
It is carried out in the manner of an informal enquiry, using a combination of open and closed questions, supplemented by structured tests to assess cognition. The MSE can also be considered part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non-mental-health settings. Information is usually recorded as free-form text using the standard headings, but brief MSE checklists are available for use in emergency situations, for example, by paramedics or emergency department staff.
The information obtained in the MSE is used, together with the biographical and social information of the psychiatric history, to generate a diagnosis, a psychiatric formulation and a treatment plan.

==Domains==
The mnemonic ASEPTIC can be used to remember the domains of the MSE:
* A - Appearance/Behavior
* S - Speech
* E - Emotion (Mood and Affect)
* P - Perception
* T - Thought Content and Process
* I - Insight and Judgement
* C - Cognition

===Appearance===
Clinicians assess the physical aspects such as the appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient&#x27;s gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.

===Attitude===
Attitude, also known as rapport or cooperation, refers to the patient&#x27;s approach to the interview process and the quality of information obtained during the assessment. Observations of attitude include whether the patient is cooperative, hostile, open or secretive.

===Behavior===
Abnormalities of behavior, also called abnormalities of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, as well as more general observations of the patient&#x27;s level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient&#x27;s eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette&#x27;s syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or &quot;gegenhalten&quot;). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.

More global behavioural abnormalities may be noted, such as an increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, a side effect of antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient&#x27;s emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.

===Mood and affect===
The distinction between mood and affect in the MSE is subject to some disagreement. For example, Trzepacz and Baker (1993) describe affect as &quot;the external and dynamic manifestations of a person&#x27;s internal emotional state&quot; and mood as &quot;a person&#x27;s predominant internal state at any one time&quot;, whereas Sims (1995) refers to affect as &quot;differentiated specific feelings&quot; and mood as &quot;a more prolonged state or disposition&quot;. This article will use the Trzepacz and Baker (1993) definitions, with mood regarded as a current subjective state as described by the patient, and affect as the examiner&#x27;s inferences of the quality of the patient&#x27;s emotional state based on objective observation.

Mood is described using the patient&#x27;s own words, and can also be described in summary terms such as neutral, euthymic, dysphoric, euphoric, angry, anxious or apathetic. Alexithymic individuals may be unable to describe their subjective mood state. An individual who is unable to experience any pleasure may have anhedonia.

Affect is described by labelling the apparent emotion conveyed by the person&#x27;s nonverbal behavior (anxious, sad etc.), and also by using the parameters of appropriateness, intensity, range, reactivity and mobility. Affect may be described as appropriate or inappropriate to the current situation, and as congruent or incongruent with their thought content. For example, someone who shows a bland affect when describing a very distressing experience would be described as showing incongruent affect, which might suggest schizophrenia. The intensity of the affect may be described as normal, blunted affect, exaggerated, flat, heightened or overly dramatic. A flat or blunted affect is associated with schizophrenia, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder; heightened affect might suggest mania, and an overly dramatic or exaggerated affect might suggest certain personality disorders. Mobility refers to the extent to which affect changes during the interview: the affect may be described as fixed, mobile, immobile, constricted/restricted or labile. The person may show a full range of affect, in other words a wide range of emotional expression during the assessment, or may be described as having restricted affect. The affect may also be described as reactive, in other words changing flexibly and appropriately with the flow of conversation, or as unreactive. A bland lack of concern for one&#x27;s disability may be described as showing &quot;la belle indifférence&quot;, a feature of conversion disorder, which is historically termed &quot;hysteria&quot; in older texts.

===Speech===
Speech is assessed by observing the patient&#x27;s spontaneous speech, and also by using structured tests of specific language functions.
This heading is concerned with the production of speech rather than the &quot;content&quot; of speech, which is addressed under thought process and thought content (see below).
When observing the patient&#x27;s spontaneous speech, the interviewer will note and comment on paralinguistic features such as the loudness, rhythm, prosody, intonation, pitch, phonation, articulation, quantity, rate, spontaneity and latency of speech. Many acoustic features have been shown to be significantly altered in mental health disorders.
A structured assessment of speech includes an assessment of expressive language by asking the patient to name objects, repeat short sentences, or produce as many words as possible from a certain category in a set time. Simple language tests also form part of the mini-mental state examination. In practice, the structured assessment of receptive and expressive language is often reported under Cognition (see below).

Language assessment will allow the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism spectrum disorders may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person&#x27;s words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject&#x27;s own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.
Speech assessment also contributes to assessment of mood, for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid, loud and pressured speech; on the other hand depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow, quiet and hesitant manner.

===Thought process===

Thought process in the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be directly observed but can only be described by the patient, or inferred from a patient&#x27;s speech. Form of the thought is captured in this category. One should describe the thought form as thought directed A→B (normal), versus formal thought disorders. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, knight&#x27;s move thinking. Thought may be described as &#x27;circumstantial&#x27; when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic. Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience &#x27;flight of ideas&#x27; (a manic symptom), when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although in flight of ideas a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic, syllabic, rhyming associations in the patient&#x27;s speech (i.e., &quot;I love to eat peaches, beach beaches, sand castles fall in the waves, braves are going to the finals, fee fi fo fum. Golden egg.&quot;). Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and one of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It can also be a feature of severe depression or dementia. A patient with dementia might also experience thought perseveration. Thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas.

===Thought content===
A description of thought content would be the largest section of the MSE report. It would describe a patient&#x27;s suicidal thoughts, depressed cognition, delusions, overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. One should separate the thought content into pathological thought, versus non-pathological thought. Importantly one should specify suicidal thoughts as either intrusive, unwanted, and not able to translate in the capacity to act on these thoughts (mens rea), versus suicidal thoughts that may lead to the act of suicide (actus reus).

Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals&#x27; thoughts in an open-ended conversational manner with regard to their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the thoughts, the extent to which the thoughts are experienced as one&#x27;s own and under one&#x27;s control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts.

====Delusions====
A delusion has three essential qualities: it can be defined as &quot;a false, unshakeable idea or belief (1) which is out of keeping with the patient&#x27;s educational, cultural and social background (2) ... held with extraordinary conviction and subjective certainty (3)&quot;, and is a core feature of psychotic disorders. For instance an alliance to a particular political party, or sports team would not be considered a delusion in some societies.

The patient&#x27;s delusions may be described within the SEGUE PM mnemonic as: somatic, erotomanic delusions, grandiose delusions, unspecified delusions, envious delusions (c.f. delusional jealousy), persecutory or paranoid delusions, or multifactorial delusions. There are several other forms of delusions, these include descriptions such as: delusions of reference, or delusional misidentification, or delusional memories (e.g., &quot;I was a goat last year&quot;) among others.

Delusional symptoms can be reported as on a continuum from: full symptoms (with no insight), partial symptoms (where they may start questioning these delusions), nil symptoms (where symptoms are resolved), or after complete treatment there are still delusional symptoms or ideas that could develop into delusions you can characterize this as residual symptoms.

Delusions can suggest several diseases such as schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder, mania, depression with psychotic features, or delusional disorders. One can differentiate delusional disorders from schizophrenia for example by the age of onset for delusional disorders being older with a more complete and unaffected personality, where the delusion may only partially impact their life and be fairly encapsulated off from the rest of their formed personalityfor example, believing that a spider lives in their hair, but this belief not affecting their work, relationships, or education. Whereas schizophrenia typically arises earlier in life with a disintegration of personality and a failure to cope with work, relationships, or education.

Other features differentiate diseases with delusions as well. Delusions may be described as mood-congruent (the delusional content in keeping with the mood), typical of manic or depressive psychosis, or mood-incongruent (delusional content not in keeping with the mood) which are more typical of schizophrenia. Delusions of control, or passivity experiences (in which the individual has the experience of the mind or body being under the influence or control of some kind of external force or agency), are typical of schizophrenia. Examples of this include experiences of thought withdrawal, thought insertion, thought broadcasting, and somatic passivity. Schneiderian first rank symptoms are a set of delusions and hallucinations which have been said to be highly suggestive of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Delusions of guilt, delusions of poverty, and nihilistic delusions (belief that one has no mind or is already dead) are typical of depressive psychosis.

====Overvalued Ideas====
An overvalued idea is an emotionally charged belief that may be held with sufficient conviction to make believer emotionally charged or aggressive but that fails to possess all three characteristics of delusion—most importantly, incongruity with cultural norms. Therefore, any strong, fixed, false, but culturally normative belief can be considered an &quot;overvalued idea&quot;. Hypochondriasis is an overvalued idea that one has an illness, dysmorphophobia that a part of one&#x27;s body is abnormal, and anorexia nervosa that one is overweight or fat.

====Obsessions====
An obsession is an &quot;undesired, unpleasant, intrusive thought that cannot be suppressed through the patient&#x27;s volition&quot;, but unlike passivity experiences described above, they are not experienced as imposed from outside the patient&#x27;s mind. Obsessions are typically intrusive thoughts of violence, injury, dirt or sex, or obsessive ruminations on intellectual themes. A person can also describe obsessional doubt, with intrusive worries about whether they have made the wrong decision, or forgotten to do something, for example turn off the gas or lock the house. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the individual experiences obsessions with or without compulsions (a sense of having to carry out certain ritualized and senseless actions against their wishes).

====Phobias====
A phobia is &quot;a dread of an object or situation that does not in reality pose any threat&quot;, and is distinct from a delusion in that the patient is aware that the fear is irrational. A phobia is usually highly specific to certain situations and will usually be reported by the patient rather than being observed by the clinician in the assessment interview.

====Preoccupations====
Preoccupations are thoughts which are not fixed, false or intrusive, but have an undue prominence in the person&#x27;s mind. Clinically significant preoccupations would include thoughts of suicide, homicidal thoughts, suspicious or fearful beliefs associated with certain personality disorders, depressive beliefs (for example that one is unloved or a failure), or the cognitive distortions of anxiety and depression.

====Suicidal thoughts====
The MSE contributes to clinical risk assessment by including a thorough exploration of any suicidal or hostile thought content. Assessment of suicide risk includes detailed questioning about the nature of the person&#x27;s suicidal thoughts, belief about death, reasons for living, and whether the person has made any specific plans to end his or her life. The most important questions to ask are: Do you have suicidal feeling now; have you ever attempted suicide (highly correlated with future suicide attempts); do you have plans to commit suicide in the future; and, do you have any deadlines where you may commit suicide (e.g., numerology calculation, doomsday belief, Mother&#x27;s Day, anniversary, Christmas).

===Perceptions===
A perception in this context is any sensory experience, and the three broad types of perceptual disturbance are hallucinations, pseudohallucinations and illusions. A hallucination is defined as a sensory perception in the absence of any external stimulus, and is experienced in external or objective space (i.e. experienced by the subject as real). An illusion is defined as a false sensory perception in the presence of an external stimulus, in other words a distortion of a sensory experience, and may be recognized as such by the subject. A pseudohallucination is experienced in internal or subjective space (for example as &quot;voices in my head&quot;) and is regarded as akin to fantasy.
Other sensory abnormalities include a distortion of the patient&#x27;s sense of time, for example déjà vu, or a distortion of the sense of self (depersonalization) or sense of reality (derealization).

Hallucinations can occur in any of the five senses, although auditory and visual hallucinations are encountered more frequently than tactile (touch), olfactory (smell) or gustatory (taste) hallucinations.
Auditory hallucinations are typical of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one&#x27;s thoughts spoken aloud (&quot;gedankenlautwerden&quot; or &quot;écho de la pensée&quot;) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.

===Cognition===

This section of the MSE covers the patient&#x27;s level of alertness, orientation, attention, memory, visuospatial functioning, language functions and executive functions. Unlike other sections of the MSE, use is made of structured tests in addition to unstructured observation.
Alertness is a global observation of level of consciousness, i.e. awareness of and responsiveness to the environment, and this might be described as alert, clouded, drowsy, or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient where he or she is (for example what building, town and state) and what time it is (time, day, date).

Attention and concentration are assessed by several tests, commonly serial sevens test subtracting 7 from 100 and subtracting 7 from the difference 5 times. Alternatively: spelling a five-letter word backwards, saying the months or days of the week in reverse order, serial threes (subtract three from twenty five times), and by testing digit span. Memory is assessed in terms of immediate registration (repeating a set of words), short-term memory (recalling the set of words after an interval, or recalling a short paragraph), and long-term memory (recollection of well known historical or geographical facts). Visuospatial functioning can be assessed by the ability to copy a diagram, draw a clock face, or draw a map of the consulting room. Language is assessed through the ability to name objects, repeat phrases, and by observing the individual&#x27;s spontaneous speech and response to instructions. Executive functioning can be screened for by asking the &quot;similarities&quot; questions (&quot;what do x and y have in common?&quot;) and by means of a verbal fluency task (e.g. &quot;list as many words as you can starting with the letter F, in one minute&quot;). The mini-mental state examination is a simple structured cognitive assessment which is in widespread use as a component of the MSE.

Mild impairment of attention and concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication. Specific language abnormalities may be associated with pathology in Wernicke&#x27;s area or Broca&#x27;s area of the brain. In Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.
Visuospatial or constructional abnormalities here may be associated with parietal lobe pathology, and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate frontal lobe pathology. This kind of brief cognitive testing is regarded as a screening process only, and any abnormalities are more carefully assessed using formal neuropsychological testing.

The MSE may include a brief neuropsychiatric examination in some situations. Frontal lobe pathology is suggested if the person cannot repetitively execute a motor sequence (e.g. &quot;paper-scissors-rock&quot;).
The posterior columns are assessed by the person&#x27;s ability to feel the vibrations of a tuning fork on the wrists and ankles.
The parietal lobe can be assessed by the person&#x27;s ability to identify objects by touch alone and with eyes closed.
A cerebellar disorder may be present if the person cannot stand with arms extended, feet touching and eyes closed without swaying (Romberg&#x27;s sign); if there is a tremor when the person reaches for an object; or if he or she is unable to touch a fixed point, close the eyes and touch the same point again.
Pathology in the basal ganglia may be indicated by rigidity and resistance to movement of the limbs, and by the presence of characteristic involuntary movements.
A lesion in the posterior fossa can be detected by asking the patient to roll his or her eyes upwards (Parinaud&#x27;s syndrome).
Focal neurological signs such as these might reflect the effects of some prescribed psychiatric medications, chronic drug or alcohol use, head injuries, tumors or other brain disorders.

===Insight===
The person&#x27;s understanding of his or her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and understanding of the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient&#x27;s explanatory account descriptively.

Impaired insight is characteristic of psychosis and dementia, and is an important consideration in treatment planning and in assessing the capacity to consent to treatment. Anosognosia is the clinical term for the condition in which the patient is unaware of their neurological deficit or psychiatric condition.

===Judgment===
Judgment refers to the patient&#x27;s capacity to make sound, reasoned and responsible decisions. One should frame judgement to the functions or domains that are normal versus impaired (e.g., poor judgement is isolated to petty theft, able to function in relationships, work, academics).

Traditionally, the MSE included the use of standard hypothetical questions such as &quot;what would you do if you found a stamped, addressed envelope lying in the street?&quot;; however contemporary practice is to inquire about how the patient has responded or would respond to real-life challenges and contingencies. Assessment would take into account the individual&#x27;s executive system capacity in terms of impulsiveness, social cognition, self-awareness and planning ability.

Impaired judgment is not specific to any diagnosis but may be a prominent feature of disorders affecting the frontal lobe of the brain. If a person&#x27;s judgment is impaired due to mental illness, there might be implications for the person&#x27;s safety or the safety of others.

==Cultural considerations==
There are potential problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient&#x27;s culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs need to be distinguished from delusions and hallucinations these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient&#x27;s language and educational background into account. Clinician&#x27;s racial bias is another potential confounder. Consultation with cultural leaders in community or clinicians when working with Aboriginal people can help guide if any cultural phenomena has been considered when completing an MSE with Aboriginal patients and things to consider from a cross-cultural context.

==Children==
There are particular challenges in carrying out an MSE with young children and others with limited language such as people with intellectual impairment. The examiner would explore and clarify the individual&#x27;s use of words to describe mood, thought content or perceptions, as words may be used idiosyncratically with a different meaning from that assumed by the examiner. In this group, tools such as play materials, puppets, art materials or diagrams (for instance with multiple choices of facial expressions depicting emotions) may be used to facilitate recall and explanation of experiences.

<doc id="1065361" wikidata="Q373400" url="?curid=1065361" title="Life in Mono (album)">
<text>Life in Mono is the third studio album by English pop singer Emma Bunton. The album was originally set for a November 2006 release in the UK, however it was later pushed back to 4 December 2006. Much like her previous album, &quot;Free Me&quot;, the album experiments with elements of 1960s pop music. For this particular album the musical arrangement was more directed towards 1960s French pop music, with some elements of British 1960s pop and Motown.

==Background==
The album was inspired by 1960s sounds, like motown, bossa nova and pop. Bunton had been working on her third release since winter 2004. The album&#x27;s title track is a cover version of the hit &quot;Life in Mono&quot; by 1990s trip hop band Mono, best known through its usage in the 1998 film &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. The track &quot;Take Me to Another Town&quot; contains a sample from Herb Alpert&#x27;s 1965 &quot;Green Peppers&quot;. Songs recorded during this period that did not appear on the final album include &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Secrets&quot;, &quot;Crazy Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Ladylike&quot; and &quot;In Another Life&quot;.

Due to Bunton&#x27;s pregnancy all forms of promotion were cancelled after a few months.

==Singles==
*The first single taken from the album was a cover of Petula Clark&#x27;s 1964 hit single &quot;Downtown&quot;. It was released on 13 November 2006. It was the 2006 BBC Children in Need official charity single and reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart.
*The second single, &quot;All I Need to Know&quot; was released on 12 February 2007. It charted at No. 60 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alex Macpherson found that &quot;Life in Mono&quot; &quot;continues in the same vein&quot; as previous album &quot;Free Me&quot;, &quot;with breezy Motown rhythms and tastefully swooping strings offsetting Bunton&#x27;s candyfloss-light vocals exquisitely. Though she has largely eschewed the playful pastiche that made &quot;Free Me&quot; such a triumph in favour of a more languid subtlety, it&#x27;s still a sound no one else in British pop is pursuing. And it&#x27;s difficult to think of anyone who could pull it off more delightfully than Bunton does [...] There&#x27;s an undercurrent of vague wistfulness that never quite leaves her voice, lending it emotional clout beyond its technical limitations.&quot; Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music UK called the album &quot;a rather lovely record and quite possibly the last Spice-related release which anyone in the world barring immediate family members even vaguely cares about - she chose wisely. Like its charming predecessor &quot;Free Me&quot;, &quot;Life in Mono&quot; comes wrapped-up in a vogueish &#x27;60s French pop gleam, all sugary harmonies, luscious strings and crafty Bacharach style arrangements.

MSN remarked that &quot;while unlikely to be a chart topper, nevertheless &quot;Life In Mono&quot; is a charming record and reason enough for Emma to delay that pension-boosting Spice Girls reunion any time soon.&quot; &quot;Digital Spy&quot;″s Miriam Zendle opined that &quot;there are a whole number of problems with this album, though Emma Bunton&#x27;s voice is not one of them. It&#x27;s utterly bland and very repetitive in terms of content. It seems to be geared very much towards the Christmas market and as such is incredibly cheesy and soft-focus. It&#x27;s hard to find any tracks that really stand out, as they pretty much all sound exactly the same. Bunton&#x27;s gentle, lovely vocals are the only thing that keeps the album from sinking into forgettability, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s just not enough.&quot; AllMusic editor Sharon Mawer called it &quot;a safe album, light and fluffy with almost no substance&quot;. Talia Kraines from BBC Music felt that &quot;there&#x27;s little on this album that could see Emma bothering [another top 5 hit]. That&#x27;s not to say little ol&#x27; Baby Spice hasn&#x27;t tried [...] but while she may be continuing the Sixties vibe of &quot;Free Me&quot;, there&#x27;s nothing that even flirts with the beehive razzamatazz of &quot;Maybe&quot;.&quot;

==Chart performance==
The album was Bunton&#x27;s first not to reach the UK top 10. &quot;Life in Mono&quot; debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 65 on 10 December 2006 and fell to number 75 in its second week before dropping out of the chart the following week.

<text>End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a method of implementing a secure communication system where only communicating users can participate. No one else, including the system provider, telecom providers, Internet providers or malicious actors, can access the cryptographic keys needed to read or send messages.

End-to-end encryption prevents data from being read or secretly modified, except by the true sender and intended recipients. Frequently, the messages are relayed from the sender to the recipients by a service provider. However, messages are encrypted by the sender and no third party, including the service provider, has the means to decrypt them. The recipients retrieve the encrypted messages and decrypt them independently. Since third parties cannot decrypt the data being communicated or stored, services that provide end-to-end encryption are better at protecting user data when they are affected by data breaches. Such services are also unable to share user data with government authorities, domestic or international.

In 2022, the UK&#x27;s Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, the government body responsible for enforcing online data standards, stated that opposition to E2EE was misinformed and the debate too unbalanced, with too little focus on benefits, since E2EE helped keep children safe online and law enforcement access to stored data on servers was &quot;not the only way&quot; to find abusers.

== E2EE and privacy ==
In many non-E2EE messaging systems, including email and many chat networks, messages pass through intermediaries and are stored by a third party service provider, from which they are retrieved by the recipient. Even if the messages are encrypted, they are only encrypted &#x27;in transit&#x27;, and are thus accessible by the service provider. Server-side disk encryption is also distinct from E2EE because it does not prevent the service provider from viewing the information, as they have the encryption keys and can simply decrypt it.

The lack of end-to-end encryption can allow service providers to easily provide search and other features, or to scan for illegal and unacceptable content. However, it also means that content can be read by anyone who has access to the data stored by the service provider, by design or via a backdoor. This can be a concern in many cases where privacy is important, such as in governmental and military communications, financial transactions, and when sensitive information such as health and biometric data are sent. If this content were shared without E2EE, a malicious actor or adversarial government could obtain it through unauthorized access or subpoenas targeted at the service provider.

E2EE alone does not guarantee privacy or security. For example, data may be held unencrypted on the user&#x27;s own device, or be accessible via their own app, if their login is compromised.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot; originally only meant that the communication is never decrypted during its transport from the sender to the receiver.
For example, around 2003, E2EE has been proposed as an additional layer of encryption for GSM or TETRA, in addition to the existing radio encryption protecting the communication between the mobile device and the network infrastructure. This has been standardized by SFPG for TETRA. Note that in TETRA E2EE, the keys are generated by a Key Management Centre (KMC) or a Key Management Facility (KMF), not by the communicating users.
Later, around 2014, the meaning of &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot; started to evolve when WhatsApp encrypted a portion of its network, requiring that not only the communication stays encrypted during transport, This new meaning is now the widely accepted one.

== Modern usage ==
As of 2016, typical server-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee the protection of communications between clients and servers, meaning that users have to trust the third parties who are running the servers with the sensitive content. End-to-end encryption is regarded as safer because it reduces the number of parties who might be able to interfere or break the encryption. In the case of instant messaging, users may use a third-party client or plugin to implement an end-to-end encryption scheme over an otherwise non-E2EE protocol.

Some non-E2EE systems, such as Lavabit and Hushmail, have described themselves as offering &quot;end-to-end&quot; encryption when they did not. Other systems, such as Telegram and Google Allo, have been criticized for not enabling end-to-end encryption by default. Telegram did not enable end-to-end encryption by default on VoIP calls while users were using desktop software version, but that problem was fixed quickly. However, as of 2020, Telegram still features no end-to-end encryption by default, no end-to-end encryption for group chats, and no end-to-end encryption for its desktop clients. In 2022, Facebook Messenger came under scrutiny because the messages between a mother and daughter in Nebraska were used to seek criminal charges in an abortion-related case against both of them. The daughter told the police that she had a miscarriage and tried to search for the date of her miscarriage in her Messenger app. Police suspected there could be more information within the messages and obtained and served a warrant against Facebook to gain access. The messages allegedly mentioned the mother obtaining abortion pills for her daughter and then burning the evidence. Facebook expanded default end-to-end encryption in the Messenger app just days later. Writing for &quot;Wired&quot;, Albert Fox Cahn criticized Messenger&#x27;s approach to end-to-end encryption, which was not enabled by default, required opt-in for each conversation, and split the message thread into two chats which were easy for the user to confuse.

Some encrypted backup and file sharing services provide client-side encryption. This type of encryption is not referred to as end-to-end encryption because only one end has the ability to decrypt the data. However, the term &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot; is sometimes incorrectly used to describe client-side encryption.

== Challenges ==

=== Man-in-the-middle attacks ===
End-to-end encryption ensures that data is transferred securely between endpoints. But, rather than try to break the encryption, an eavesdropper may impersonate a message recipient (during key exchange or by substituting their public key for the recipient&#x27;s), so that messages are encrypted with a key known to the attacker. After decrypting the message, the snoop can then encrypt it with a key that they share with the actual recipient, or their public key in case of asymmetric systems, and send the message on again to avoid detection. This is known as a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).

==== Authentication ====

Most end-to-end encryption protocols include some form of endpoint authentication specifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, one could rely on certification authorities or a web of trust. An alternative technique is to generate cryptographic hashes (fingerprints) based on the communicating users’ public keys or shared secret keys. The parties compare their fingerprints using an outside (out-of-band) communication channel that guarantees integrity and authenticity of communication (but not necessarily secrecy), before starting their conversation. If the fingerprints match, there is, in theory, no man in the middle.

When displayed for human inspection, fingerprints usually use some form of binary-to-text encoding. These strings are then formatted into groups of characters for readability. Some clients instead display a natural language representation of the fingerprint. As the approach consists of a one-to-one mapping between fingerprint blocks and words, there is no loss in entropy. The protocol may choose to display words in the user&#x27;s native (system) language. This can, however, make cross-language comparisons prone to errors.

In order to improve localization, some protocols have chosen to display fingerprints as base 10 strings instead of more error prone hexadecimal or natural language strings. An example of the base 10 fingerprint (called &quot;safety number&quot; in Signal and &quot;security code&quot; in WhatsApp) would be:

 37345 35585 86758 07668
 05805 48714 98975 19432
 47272 72741 60915 64451

Other applications such as Telegram, instead, encode fingerprints using emojis.

Modern messaging applications can also display fingerprints as QR codes that users can scan off each other&#x27;s devices.

=== Endpoint security ===
The end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves. Each user&#x27;s computer can still be hacked to steal their cryptographic key (to create a MITM attack) or simply read the recipients’ decrypted messages both in real time and from log files. Even the most perfectly encrypted communication pipe is only as secure as the mailbox on the other end. Major attempts to increase endpoint security have been to isolate key generation, storage and cryptographic operations to a smart card such as Google&#x27;s Project Vault. However, since plaintext input and output are still visible to the host system, malware can monitor conversations in real time. A more robust approach is to isolate all sensitive data to a fully air gapped computer. PGP has been recommended by experts for this purpose. However, as Bruce Schneier points out, Stuxnet developed by US and Israel successfully jumped air gap and reached Natanz nuclear plant&#x27;s network in Iran. To deal with key exfiltration with malware, one approach is to split the Trusted Computing Base behind two unidirectionally connected computers that prevent either insertion of malware, or exfiltration of sensitive data with inserted malware.

=== Backdoors ===
A backdoor is usually a secret method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, an embedded device, etc. Companies may also willingly or unwillingly introduce backdoors to their software that help subvert key negotiation or bypass encryption altogether. In 2013, information leaked by Edward Snowden showed that Skype had a backdoor which allowed Microsoft to hand over their users&#x27; messages to the NSA despite the fact that those messages were officially end-to-end encrypted.

Following terrorist attacks in San Bernardino in 2015 and Pensacola in 2019, the FBI requested backdoors to Apple&#x27;s iPhone software. The company, however, refused to create a backdoor for the government, citing concern that such a tool could pose risk for its consumers’ privacy.

=== Compliance and regulatory requirements for content inspection ===
While E2EE can offer privacy benefits that make it desirable in consumer-grade services, many businesses have to balance these benefits with their regulatory requirements. For example, many organizations are subject to mandates that require them to be able to decrypt any communication between their employees or between their employees and third parties.
This might be needed for archival purposes, for inspection by Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems, for litigation-related eDiscovery or for detection of malware and other threats in the data streams. For this reason, some enterprise-focused communications and information protection systems might implement encryption in a way that ensures all transmissions are encrypted with the encryption being terminated at their internal systems (on-premises or cloud-based) so they can have access to the information for inspection and processing.

<doc id="1065369" wikidata="Q1896744" url="?curid=1065369" title="Franklin Township, Warren County, Ohio">
<text>Franklin Township is one of the eleven townships of Warren County, Ohio, United States. It is located in the northwest corner of the county. The population was 31,676 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Located in the northwestern corner of the county, it borders the following townships and city:
*German Township, Montgomery County - north
*Clearcreek Township - east
*Turtlecreek Township - south
*Middletown - southwest
*Madison Township, Butler County - west
*Miami Township, Montgomery County - northwest

A large part of the township is in the cities of Franklin and Carlisle, but parts are in the city of Springboro.

Other communities in the township are Hunter, Blue Ball, and Chautauqua.

==Name and history==
Named from the village of Franklin, it is one of twenty-one Franklin Townships statewide.

One of the original four townships of Warren County, Franklin Township was created on May 10, 1803.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

In November 2004, the people of Franklin Township and the city of Franklin voted on a committee to study merging the two communities. The Board of Elections improperly failed to submit the question to the voters in the township, but the vote in the city was against the merger.

==Public services==
Most of the township is in the Franklin City and Carlisle City School Districts, but parts are in the Springboro City and Middletown City School Districts. Telephone service is provided through the Franklin, Middletown, Miamisburg, Centerville, and Germantown exchanges, while mail is provided through the Franklin, Carlisle, and Middletown post offices.

Interstate 75 runs through the township, as do State Routes 122, 123 and 73. The Miami and Erie Canal formerly ran through the township.

<doc id="1065389" wikidata="Q6671303" url="?curid=1065389" title="Lone Justice">
<text>Lone Justice is an American country rock band formed in 1982 by guitarist Ryan Hedgecock and singer Maria McKee in Los Angeles. The band released two albums, &quot;Lone Justice&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Shelter&quot; the following year, before disbanding in 1987.

==History==
===Early era===
Lone Justice began as part of the L.A. cowpunk scene of the 1980s, inspired by Hedgecock and McKee&#x27;s shared affection for rockabilly and country music. The group started out as a strict cover band, but after the additions of bassist David Harrington and drummer Don Willens, they began to compose their own material. Marvin Etzioni was initially brought in as producer, arranger and songwriter for the band, but ended up replacing Harrington as bassist in 1983. By 1984, Don Heffington had replaced Willens as drummer. Their early sound was a fusion of country music and punk rock with rockabilly elements, but by the time of their first album, the band had begun to incorporate elements of roots rock and singer-songwriter styles. Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers was a frequent guest musician at their live shows. The band earned early support from Dolly Parton, who attended one of their club shows and later recalled McKee as &quot;The greatest girl singer any band could ever have.&quot;

Lone Justice developed their initial following within the Los Angeles music scene. Local rock journalist Stann Findelle reported in &quot;Performance&quot; magazine that the band &quot;stole the show&quot; at the Whisky a Go Go from headliner Arthur Lee, who was attempting a comeback that night, but left after two songs. Linda Ronstadt was introduced to the band by wardrobe stylist Genny Schorr. Linda Ronstadt made a call to David Geffen and they were signed to Geffen Records amid a flurry of publicity.

Their self-titled debut appeared in 1985, followed by a tour in support of U2. For touring, the band augmented their line-up with guitarist Tony Gilkyson, who left the band in 1986. Produced by Jimmy Iovine, the album received some significant critical reviews, including that of Jimmy Guterman, then a critic at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who placed it in his list of the best albums ever made. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1985 ranked it No. 24. Nonetheless, the album failed to connect with country or rock audiences, and the whole enterprise suffered from excessive pre-release promotion that &quot;raised expectations... [the album] couldn&#x27;t possibly satisfy&quot;. Two singles fizzled – &quot;Sweet, Sweet Baby (I&#x27;m Falling)&quot; and &quot;Ways To Be Wicked&quot;, the latter written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell – and the album did not meet commercial expectations.

===Later era===
In the record&#x27;s wake, Etzioni and Heffington went their separate ways, and McKee and Hedgecock assembled an all-new band. After enlisting guitarist Shane Fontayne, bassist Gregg Sutton, drummer Rudy Richman, and keyboardist Bruce Brody (formerly of the Patti Smith Group), Lone Justice recorded their second LP, &quot;Shelter&quot;. Steve Van Zandt was the producer, along with Jimmy Iovine and the band. This record saw them almost completely abandoning much of their earlier cowpunk, rockabilly, and roots rock influences in favor of what could be considered more typical 1980s pop/rock production, with heavy emphasis on drum machines and synthesizers. Commercially, the album charted lower than its predecessor, reaching only No. 65 on the album charts. However, the title single did better than the band&#x27;s previous two singles, reaching No. 26 on the Rock Singles chart, and No. 47 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

===Disbandment===
Less than a year after &quot;Shelter&quot;&#x27;s release, McKee broke up the band for good in 1987 and went on to a solo career. Heffington became a session drummer, while Etzioni recorded under the name &quot;the Mandolin Man&quot;. Rudy Richman played drums with UK rock band The Quireboys between 1992 and 1993, appearing on the album &quot;Bitter Sweet &amp; Twisted&quot;. Fontayne played guitar in Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s band for the tour backing up the &quot;Lucky Town&quot;/&quot;Human Touch&quot; albums. After a decade removed from the music industry, Hedgecock returned in 1996 as half of the duo Parlor James.

A Lone Justice retrospective, &quot;This World Is Not My Home&quot;, was released in January 1999, featuring early demo recordings. A budget compilation was issued in 2003 as part of Universal Music&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Masters&quot; series. Their 1985 performance of &quot;Sweet, Sweet Baby (I&#x27;m Falling)&quot; was released by BBC Video on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test Vol. 3&quot; compilation DVD, 2004. Between 2014 and 2019, Omnivore Recordings issued three retrospective releases consisting of demo and live recordings made in 1983: &quot;This Is Lone Justice: The Vaught Tapes, 1983&quot; (2014), &quot;The Western Tapes, 1983&quot; (2018), and &quot;Live at the Palomino, 1983&quot; (2019).

In March 2021, Heffington died of leukemia at age 70.
Sutton died on October 22, 2023, at the age of 74.

===Viva Lone Justice===
In May 2024 it was announced that a new 7” &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; / &quot;Nothing Can Stop My Loving You&quot; will be available digitally from 28th May and physical release 12th July.
It&#x27;s the first single from the album &quot;Viva Lone Justice&quot;.

<text>Lincoln Barrett (born 18 September 1979), better known by the stage name High Contrast, is a Welsh electronic music producer, DJ and record producer. He produces drum and bass music, and his 2009 album &quot;Confidential&quot; reached BPI gold certification (100,000 units sold in the UK).

==Career==
===Early work===
Barrett was born in Penarth, near Cardiff, and grew up more interested in films and film soundtracks than rock or pop music; he cites Wendy Carlos&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; soundtrack album and the Vangelis soundtrack for &quot;Blade Runner&quot; as defining musical influences. Whilst studying film making in Newport, he heard J Majik&#x27;s &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; which turned the then 17-year-old Barrett on to drum and bass music. Barrett used to work in Cardiff&#x27;s only electronic record shop, Catapult. A short time after he began to make music, he was given a DJ residency at Cardiff&#x27;s drum and bass night, named Silent Running. During his residency at Silent Running, Barrett played alongside artists such as Grooverider and London Elektricity.

===2000s===
In June 2002, Barrett&#x27;s debut album, &quot;True Colours&quot;, was released on Hospital Records, with &quot;Return of Forever&quot; and &quot;Global Love&quot; finding their way into the UK Singles Chart. His second album was &quot;High Society&quot;.

On 6 April 2003, High Contrast was featured on the BBC Radio 1 &quot;Essential Mix&quot; show. His mix included liquid funk mostly from the Hospital Records label. On 9 January 2005, this Essential Mix was replayed on Radio 1 when another drum and bass artist, Andy C, was unable to deliver his mix. In October 2005, Barrett launched his own record label, The Contrast. The first single, &quot;Days Go By&quot; / &quot;What We Do&quot; was released in early November 2005.

In 2007, he delivered his second effort, selected as &quot;Essential Mix of the Year&quot; by Pete Tong. His third album &quot;Tough Guys Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; was released in October 2007. The second single from the album, &quot;If We Ever&quot;, was supported on Radio 1 by Annie Mac, Zane Lowe and Jo Whiley helping it to reach number 1 in the DnB chart, number 1 in the dance chart and number 4 in the Indie chart.

In 2008, High Contrast remixed the #1 single &quot;No Way to Say&quot; for Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki&#x27;s remix album, &quot;Ayu-mi-x 6: Silver&quot;. He also made successful remixes of &quot;Hometown Glory&quot; by Adele and &quot;Pjanoo&quot; by Eric Prydz, which were later included on the album, &quot;Confidential&quot;. He played them during his take over for the Rob Da Bank show on BBC Radio 1 in January 2009.

===2010s===
He played at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Barrett currently is a resident DJ at the following clubs: Aperture at Clwb Ifor Bach (The Welsh Club) in Cardiff; and at Roxy in Prague. He was also on regular rotation at Fabric in London.

High Contrast played a key role in selecting and producing the music for the Athletes Parade at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Half a dozen tracks by High Contrast were played and are present in the event&#x27;s official soundtrack, &quot;Isles of Wonder&quot;.

In July 2014, High Contrast&#x27;s new single with Clare Maguire &quot;Who&#x27;s Loving You&quot; was announced. A double release, &#x27;Part 2&#x27; was Special Delivery on Annie Mac&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show, followed by &#x27;Part 1&#x27; as &quot;Hottest Record in the World&quot; for Zane Lowe.

In 2015, he remixed the R&amp;B track &quot;Muhammad Ali&quot; by the group Faithless. The same year, the mix was included in the group&#x27;s &#x27;2.0&#x27; remix album release, and also incorporated into the second half of their live performances of the song.

He signed with 3Beat in April 2016 and released his first single on the label, &quot;Remind Me&quot;.

In 2017, a new song, titled &quot;Shotgun Mouthwash&quot;, was featured on the &quot;T2 Trainspotting&quot; soundtrack.

High Contrast&#x27;s remix of &quot;The One&quot; by Jorja Smith was Nominated for a Grammy at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards

=== 2020s ===
On 13 November 2020, he released the album titled &quot;Notes From The Underground&quot;.

On 24 June 2022, he followed up with the album titled &quot;True Colours&quot; for the first time on his own label Highly Contrasting.

On 23 February 2024, he released a single with two songs &quot;Anti/Thesis Vol. 1&quot;.

==Personal life==
His father, Paul &quot;Legs&quot; Barrett, used to manage Shakin&#x27; Stevens. His mother, Lorraine Barrett, was the Welsh Assembly member for Cardiff South and Penarth until May 2011.

<text>The Sonian Forest or Sonian Wood (, ; , ) is a forest at the south-eastern edge of Brussels, Belgium. It is connected to the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos, an urban public park which enters the city up to from the city centre. 

The forest lies in the Flemish municipalities of Sint-Genesius-Rode, Hoeilaart, Overijse, and Tervuren, in the Brussels-Capital Region municipalities of Uccle, Watermael-Boitsfort, Auderghem, and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, and in the Walloon towns of La Hulpe and Waterloo. Thus, it stretches out over the three Belgian Regions. It is maintained by Flanders (56%), Brussels (38%), and Wallonia (6%). There are some contiguous tracts of privately held forest and the &quot;Kapucijnenbos&quot;, the &quot;Capuchin Wood&quot;, which belongs to the Royal Trust.

As of 2017, parts of the Sonian Forest have been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the only Belgian component to the multinational inscription &#x27;Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe&#x27;, because of their undisturbed nature and testimony to the ecological processes governing forests in Europe since the Last Glacial Period. 

==History==
The forest is part of the scattered remains of the ancient &quot;Silva Carbonaria&quot; or Charcoal Forest. Originally, it was part of the Forest of Ardennes, the Romans&#x27; &quot;Arduenna Silva&quot;. The first mention of the Sonian Forest (&quot;Soniaca Silva&quot;) dates from the early Middle Ages. Then the forest south of Brussels was crossed by the river Senne/Zenne and extended as far as Hainaut, covering most of the high ground between the Senne and the Dyle/Dijl. The 9th-century &quot;vita&quot; of Saint Foillan mentions &quot;the forest, next to the abbey of Saint Gertrude, called the Sonesian&quot;. In the Middle Ages, the forest extended over the southern part of Brabant up to the walls of Brussels and is mentioned, under the name of Ardennes, in Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&quot;. In the 16th century, it was still seven leagues in circumference, and even at the time of the French Revolution, it was very extensive.

At the start of the 19th century, the area of the wood was still about , but due to deforestation, it diminished to its current . A major blow towards this 19th-century contraction was struck when Napoleon ordered 22,000 oaks to be cut down to build the Boulogne flotilla intended for the invasion of England. King William I of the Netherlands continued to harvest the woods, and from in 1820, the forest was reduced to in 1830. Rights to a considerable portion of the forest in the neighbourhood of Waterloo was assigned in 1815 to the Duke of Wellington, who was also Prince of Waterloo in the Dutch nobility, and received the equivalent of about $140,000 today from his Belgian properties. This portion of the forest was only converted into farms in the time of the second duke. The Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos () on the outskirts of Brussels was formed out of the forest in 1861. In 1911, the forest still stretched to Tervuren, Groenendaal, and Argenteuil close to Mont-Saint-Jean and Waterloo.

Formerly, the forest held Saint Foillan Abbey not far from Nivelles. The forest served for a long period as an exclusive hunting ground for the nobility, but today is open to the general public.

==Ecology==
The Sonian Forest consists mainly of European beeches and oaks. Several trees are more than 200 years old, dating from the Austrian period.

The forest contains a somewhat reduced fauna and flora. Due to human influence (encroachment from all sides of the outer edges as well as the long-established thoroughfare roads and highways cutting deep through the forest) and impoverishment of the ecosystem, various plants and animals have become extinct. The forest was home to 46 different mammal species. Of these, seven have disappeared altogether: the brown bear (around 1000), the wolf (around 1810), the hazel dormouse (around 1842), the red deer, the badger and the hare. Stag beetles have also disappeared from the forest. The boar was thought to have been extinct since 1957, but in 2007, new specimens were discovered roaming the wood. According to the Flemish Agency for Nature and Forest (ANB), this is unlikely to be a natural spread, but probably two to four animals that most likely were either released or escaped from captivity.

The many species of bat in the forest led to it being classified as a Natura 2000 protected site. This includes five endangered species: the mouse-eared bat, Geoffroy&#x27;s bat, the barbastelle bat, the pond bat and Bechstein&#x27;s bat. Other animal species found in the forest, including the black woodpecker and the great crested newt, are considered endangered and are protected by the European Habitats Directive.

In 2016, the Sonian Forest joined the &quot;European Rewilding Network&quot;, an initiative of the Rewilding Europe organisation. The project aims to enable the growth in numbers of natural fauna such as roe deer and wild boar. Various types of wildlife crossings have been or are due to be constructed to reconnect the areas of the forest that are currently divided by large roads. A wildlife crossing (&#x27;Ecoduct&#x27;) has been built across the Brussels Ring (R0); construction started in 2016 and it was opened in June 2018.

==Real estate projects==
The edge of the Soignes forest is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings initiated by the Friends of the Soignes forest against real estate projects threatening this natural heritage.

==Attractions==
* A museum has been set up in the building of the old farm of the Groenendael Priory. The &quot;Bosmuseum Jan van Ruusbroec&quot; or &quot;Musée de la Forêt&quot; (&#x27;Forest Museum&#x27;) presents displays about the flora, fauna, history of the forest, and forest management.
* The remains of the Château de Trois-Fontaines. In this location, at the time unsafe, Duke John III of Brabant had a fortified refuge built in 1323, surrounded by a moat and flanked by a keep and a chapel. At the beginning of the 15th century, after the addition of a new building, the small fort became the residence of the &quot;gruyer&quot;, the officer responsible for watching over the dukes&#x27; hunting grounds. Poachers were locked up there and a small garrison also had its quarters there. In 1584, a fire destroyed the keep, which was rebuilt. The current building dates from this period. The keep and other buildings were destroyed at the beginning of the 19th century.
* The memorial to the forest rangers. This monument, consisting of a dolmen surrounded by a circle of eleven standing stones, was erected in 1920 in memory of eleven forest rangers killed during the First World War.
* The Tervuren Arboretum, which can be considered a living monument since it is made up of numerous species of trees imported in the 19th century from various countries to be acclimatised in Belgium.
* The memorial to the victims of the 2016 Brussels bombings at Maelbeek metro station and Brussels Airport called &quot;Memorial 22/03&quot;, located on the Drève de l&#x27;Infante/Infantedreef. 32 birches (one for each victim) were planted in their memory. The memorial&#x27;s designer is the landscaper Bas Smets. Smets describes the memorial as &quot;a place of silence and meditation.&quot; The birches are connected by a circular structure and separated from the rest of the forest by a small round canal.

==Monasteries and contemplative traditions==
Amongst the contemplative monks and nuns who lived and prayed in the forest, the most notable was John of Ruysbroeck who established a Monastery near Groenendaal at Vauvert. At this time, the forest also held a house of Cistercian nuns at Pennebeek (founded 1201 on land given by Duke Henry I of Brabant to Sister Gisle); a convent of Benedictine nuns at Forest (founded in 1107 by Gilbert de Gand) and a cloister of Dominican sisters at Val Duchesne (founded 1262 the Duchess Aleyde).

==In popular culture==

===Art===
* The Sonian Forest was historically a favourite hunting ground of the Habsburg imperial family, and as such features prominently in some famous Renaissance works of art such as the &quot;Hunts of Maximilian&quot; tapestries in the Louvre.
* Auguste Rodin made frequent trips to the forest while living in Brussels in the 1870s; he made several paintings of the forest during this time.

===Literature===
The forest features is several works of literature including:
* Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;
* Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;
* Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Field of Waterloo&quot;

==Battle of Waterloo==
The Forest of Soignes lay behind the Anglo-allied army of the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. From Roman times, it had generally been seen as a tactical blunder to position troops for battle in front of woodland because it hampers their ability to retreat. Napoleon in &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de France en 1815, avec le plan de la bataille de Mont-Saint-Jean&quot; repeatedly criticised the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s choice of battle field because of the forest to his rear.

On page 124, Bonaparte wrote, &quot;He had in his rear the denies of the forest of Soignes, so that, if beaten, retreat was impossible&quot;, and on page 158 — &quot;The enemy must have seen with affright how many difficulties the field of battle he had chosen was about to throw in the way of his retreat&quot;, and again on page 207 — &quot;The position of Mont-Saint-Jean was ill-chosen. The first requisite of a field of battle, is, to have no defiles in its rear. The injudicious choice of his field of battle, rendered all retreat impossible.&quot; However, Napoleon&#x27;s view was contradicted by Jomini, who pointed out that Wellington had good roads behind his centre and each wing which would have made a retreat through the forest safer than across an open field: Napoleon&#x27;s cavalry would have been hampered by the forest in their attempts to turn any retreat into a rout. Some have argued that there was no bottom to the forest and it would not have hampered an extraction given Wellington&#x27;s superlative expertise in handling an army disengaging from the enemy, while others have suggested that Wellington if pressed intended to retreat eastwards towards Blücher&#x27;s Prussian army so the interior of the wood was of little military significance.

<text>Edward Lewis Ferman (born March 6, 1937) is an American science fiction and fantasy editor and magazine publisher, known best as the editor of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (F&amp;SF).

Ferman is the son of Joseph W. Ferman, the publisher and sometime editor who established &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; in 1949. He took over as editor in 1964 when Avram Davidson could no longer practically continue, as a resident of Latin American locales with unreliable postal delivery. (Joseph Ferman was listed as editor during 1964–65, however, followed by Edward from January 1966 through June 1991.) Edward Ferman would take on the role of publisher, as well, by 1970, as his father gradually retired. He continued as editor until 1991, when he hired his replacement, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, and continued as publisher of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; until he sold it to Gordon Van Gelder in 2000. During Ferman&#x27;s tenure, many other speculative fiction magazines struggled or went out of business. His magazine, along with &quot;Analog&quot;, continued to maintain a regular schedule and to receive critical appreciation for its contents.

During 1969 and 1970, Ferman was also the editor of &quot;F&amp;SF&#x27;s&quot; sister publication &quot;Venture Science Fiction Magazine&quot;. Together, the Fermans had also edited and published the short-lived nostalgia and humor magazine &quot;P.S.&quot; and a similarly brief run of a magazine about mysticism and other proto-New Age matters, &quot;Inner Space.&quot;

Ferman won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor three years in a row, from 1981 through 1983. &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; had previously won four Hugos as the best professional magazine under his editorship. At least in the last decade of his tenure, he worked from a table in the family&#x27;s Connecticut house. He edited or co-edited several volumes of stories from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; and co-edited &quot;Final Stage&quot; with Barry N. Malzberg. It is probable that he also ghost-edited &quot;No Limits&quot; for or with Joseph Ferman, an anthology drawn from the pages of the first run of &quot;Venture&quot;.

Ferman was recognized by a special World Fantasy Award for professional work in 1979 and by the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1998. He was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2009.

<text>Grzymała is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
Some authorities believe that this coat of arms was brought to Poland from Germany by a knight named Zylberschweg or Zelberszwecht. It is, however, one of the oldest Polish coats of arms, whose clan&#x27;s war cry was Grzymała (for Thunder). The original homeland of this clan was the district of Łomża in Masovia. The coat of arms was later augmented to reflect a knight in full battle armor standing in the gate, whose left arm held a shield, whose right arm held a raised sword. This augmentation was received by Przecław Grzymała, for his courageous defense of the city Płock in 1078 against the Jatwings from Prince Władisław Hermann.

Subsequently the coat of arms was also abated: Prince Boleslaw Wstydliwy of Poland (1127–1179), exiled the knight Grzymała, owner of Goślice in the Palatinate of Płock, on the suspicion of treacherous dealings with Prince Kazimierz of Kujaw, and as further evidence of the Prince&#x27;s displeasure closed the gate in this knight&#x27;s coat of arms.

A second (though positive) abatement also occurred: When the Lithuanians along with the Jatwings attacked Masovia, a Grzymała, owner of Zielony and Slasy, courageously stood against them, inflicted a defeat upon them and hunted them down. For which feat of arms, the coat of arms was abated around the knight and the gate, leaving only a wall with towers, where there used to also be a rampart.

<text>Joseph Wolfe Ferman (June 8, 1906 – December 29, 1974) was a Russian–born American science fiction publisher.

==Biography==
Ferman moved to the United States and began working on the magazine &quot;American Mercury&quot;, the primary publication of the Mercury Press, which added &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1941. He was involved with the founding of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; in 1949, and became the magazine&#x27;s publisher in 1954, after Lawrence Spivak resigned to pursue his interest in the television series &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Ferman became the magazine&#x27;s official editor in 1964 although his son Edward L. Ferman did the actual editing. Edward succeeded him as publisher in 1970, with Joseph taking the title &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot; of what had become a family business.

In 1957, he founded &quot;Venture Science Fiction Magazine&quot; with Robert P. Mills as its editor. When the Fermans relaunched the magazine again more than a decade later, Edward Ferman served as editor. Other notable projects included the anthologies &quot;No Limits&quot; (1964), with stories taken from the pages of the first run of &quot;Venture&quot;, and &quot;Once and Future Tales&quot; (1964) with stories from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, but not part of the &quot;Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; series. Both of these anthologies may have been ghost-edited by Edward Ferman. Joseph Ferman also published such magazines as &quot;Mercury Mystery Book-Magazine&quot;, &quot;Bestseller Mystery Magazine&quot;, the nostalgia magazine &quot;P. S.&quot; and the proto-New Age magazine &quot;Inner Space&quot;.

Ferman lived in Rockville Centre, New York, and he died at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, New York, in 1974.

<text>Skytrax (originally known as Inflight Research Services) is a United Kingdom–based consultancy headquartered in London that runs an airline and airport review website.

==Services==
Skytrax conducts research for commercial airlines, as well as taking surveys from international travellers, to rate cabin staff, airports, airlines, airline lounges, in-flight entertainment, on-board catering, and several other elements of air travel. Apart from these evaluations, Skytrax has an airline forum where passengers give potential passengers insights and opinions about airlines. The website also hosts flight reviews, flight checks, and satisfaction surveys. Skytrax holds an annual World Airline Awards and World Airport Awards, as well as ranking airlines and airports.

==Investigations==
In 2012, the online investigations company KwikChex filed five complaints with the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) related to statements on the Skytrax website describing the volume and reliability of their reviews as well as the official status and update frequency of their ratings. The ASA ruled that there was no evidence that Skytrax had followed the robust procedures it claimed it had in place to check that all reviews were genuine. Although Skytrax argued that every review underwent a four-stage authentication process, it said it was unable to provide proof it had followed its own procedures, since customer emails were deleted 24 hours after a review was submitted. In 2012, the authority upheld all five complaints and Skytrax agreed to modify some promotional wording.

<text>Janina is a Polish nobility clan coat-of-arms. Borne by several noble families descended in the-male line from the medieval lords of Janina (the eponyms of the clan) or legally adopted into the clan upon ennoblement.

== History ==

Janina is the only coat of arms represented on the sky as constellation – Scutum. It was created by Johannes Hevelius in 1684, and originally named it Scutum Sobiescianum (the shield of Sobieski) to commemorate the victory of the Polish forces led by King John III Sobieski in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Later, the name was shortened to Scutum.

== Blazon ==
The coat of arms was used in a variety of tinctures and designs, varying greatly from family to family. All of them depicted what is described in the alternative names for the &quot;Janina&quot;, that is a &quot;field in a field&quot; or a &quot;shield within a shield&quot;.
== Notable bearers ==
Most notable bearers of this coat of arms include:
* members of the Sobieski family, including King Jan III Sobieski and Katarzyna Sobieska (&quot;pictured&quot;)

<text>Konstantin Päts ( – 18 January 1956) was an Estonian statesman and the country&#x27;s president from 1938 to 1940. Päts was one of the most influential politicians of the independent democratic Republic of Estonia, and during the two decades prior to World War II he also served five times as the country&#x27;s State Elder (equivalent to both president and prime minister). After the 16–17 June 1940 Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia, Päts remained formally in office for over a month, until he was forced to resign, imprisoned by the new Stalinist regime, and deported to the USSR, where he died in 1956.

Päts was one of the first Estonians to become active in politics, and he then started a famous, nearly four-decade long, political rivalry with Jaan Tõnisson — first through journalism with his newspaper &quot;Teataja&quot;, later through politics. Although Päts was sentenced to death (in absentia) during the Russian Revolution of 1905, he was able to flee abroad, first to Switzerland, then to Finland, where he continued his literary work. He returned to Estonia (then part of the Russian Empire), and had to serve a prison sentence in 1910–1911.

After the February Revolution in 1917, Päts headed the provincial government of the newly formed Autonomous Governorate of Estonia, which was forced to go underground after the Bolshevik coup in November 1917. On 19 February 1918, Päts became one of the three members of the Estonian Salvation Committee that issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918. He headed the Estonian Provisional Government (1918–1919), although he was also imprisoned by the German occupation regime for several months in 1918. In the provisional government, Päts also served as Minister of Internal Affairs (1918) and Minister of War (1918–1919) that left him in charge of organizing the Estonian military in the War of Independence against the Soviet Russian invasion.

During the 1920s and early 1930s, Päts led one of the more prominent right-wing parties of the time – the conservative Farmers&#x27; Assemblies, which eventually merged into another party, the Union of Settlers and Smallholders in 1932. Päts was the Speaker of the Parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;) (1922–1923) and served five times as State Elder, a post equivalent to that of president in Estonia&#x27;s radically parliamentarian system (1921–1922, 1923–1924, 1931–1932, 1932–1933, and 1933–1934). During his last term as State Elder, he organized a self-coup to neutralise the right-wing populist Vaps Movement. He was supported by the army and the parliament. During the 1934–1938 &quot;Era of Silence&quot;, many reforms were made and the economy grew, while he postponed the return of constitutional order. Largely supported by General Johan Laidoner, Commander of the Estonian Defence Forces, Päts ruled as Prime Minister in duties of the State Elder (1934–1937) and President-Regent (1937–1938) until a new constitution was adopted in 1938, after which Päts was elected the first President of Estonia. During his presidency, the Stalinist Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia in June 1940. As president, he was forced to sign decrees for over a month, until being arrested and deported to Soviet Russia, where he died in 1956.

==Family==
Päts&#x27; patrilineal ancestors originated from the village of Holstre near Viljandi, Estonia. His father, Jakob (Jaagup) Päts (1842–1909), was a housebuilder from Heimtali, near Viljandi. Konstantin&#x27;s mother, Olga Päts (&quot;née&quot; Tumanova; 1847–1914), was an orphan. According to some sources, she was raised in the Russian-speaking Razumovsky family (and her adoptive father was at one time the mayor of Valga in the then Governorate of Livonia). Other sources indicate that she may have grown up with the Krüdener family instead, and that the adoptive father was her uncle Baron Krüdener; however, it is more likely that she served the Krüdener family later as a governess. Jakob and Olga met while they were both working for the Krüdener family.

Päts had an elder brother, Nikolai (1871–1940), three younger brothers – Paul (1876–1881), Voldemar (1878–1958), and Peeter (1880–1942) – and a younger sister, Marianne (1888–1947). Since their mother Olga had been raised an Eastern Orthodox Christian, their father Jakob converted from Lutheranism to Eastern Orthodox faith. The children were all brought up in strong Orthodox traditions.

The family initially lived in Viljandi. Päts&#x27; father Jakob was one of the Estonian nationalist farmers, who in 1865 petitioned to Emperor Alexander II of Russia to remove the (what they considered oppressive) aristocratic privileges of Baltic German landowners. After the petition, Jakob came into conflict with the local nobility and in 1873 he was forced to move to Tahkuranna near Pärnu. As Päts&#x27; father was unable to find a job in Tahkuranna, the family moved to a rental apartment in Pärnu in 1882. Three years later, Jakob bought himself some land in Raeküla, near Pärnu, where they initially lived in a roadside tavern, but built a new house after the tavern burned down. Jakob divided his land into smaller lots and built half a dozen new houses on the site, which eventually grew into a borough, and later became a district of Pärnu.

==Early life==
Konstantin Päts was born on near Tahkuranna. According to locals&#x27; memories, he was born on a neighbouring roadside farm, since his mother could not reach a doctor in time and was unable to make the last few kilometers back home. He was baptized in the Tahkuranna Orthodox Church.
Konstantin started his education in the Orthodox parish school of Tahkuranna. 
In Pärnu, Konstantin attended the Russian language Orthodox parish school. Later, he attended the Riga Clerical Seminar in 1887–1892, but after deciding not to become a priest, he left for the high school in Pärnu.

From 1894 to 1898, he attended the Faculty of Law of Tartu University, from which he graduated as a cand. jur. After graduation, Päts served in the Russian 96th Infantry Regiment of Omsk in Pskov and was promoted an ensign. After rejecting an academic career in Tartu, he moved to Tallinn in 1900, to start a political career.

==Career==

===Journalism===
In Tallinn, Konstantin Päts started his career as an assistant at the advocacy of Jaan Poska, but the job was not satisfactory for Päts. In Tartu, Jaan Tõnisson had already founded his nationalist newspaper &quot;Postimees&quot; in 1891; Päts was planning to found his own in Tallinn. The first inspiration came from writers Eduard Vilde and A. H. Tammsaare, who could not get a licence from the Ministry of Internal Affairs because of their social democratic views. Instead, they used the help of Päts as an unknown lawyer with an affiliation in the Orthodox Church.

Päts was assumed by the authorities to have had established a newspaper that was loyal to the Empire and would &quot;unite all Orthodox Estonians&quot;; however, in reality his newspaper had a radical political content. The first issue of the &quot;Teataja&quot; (&quot;The Gazette&quot;) came out on , starting a rivalry not only between &quot;Postimees&quot; and &quot;Teataja&quot;, but also between Jaan Tõnisson and Konstantin Päts personally for the position of leadership in the Estonian nationalist movement. Unlike the more nationalist and radically ideological &quot;Postimees&quot;, &quot;Teataja&quot; emphasized the importance of education and commerce for the nationalist cause. The work was made difficult by the strict censorship policies imposed by the Russian Empire&#x27;s governmental authorities.

===Early political career===
Päts&#x27;s first political goal was to take power in the towns, where Baltic Germans still controlled the municipal governments. Päts served as a municipal adviser in Tallinn from 1904; and together with Jaan Poska, he organized an electoral block between Estonians and liberal Russians, which managed to win at the 1904 Tallinn municipal elections. Päts became a member of the city council; and in April 1905, he became the deputy mayor, chairing the city council. His active work at the town government left him little time for his newspaper. Because of the lack of Päts’ supervision of &quot;Teataja&quot;, a group of revolutionaries, led by Hans Pöögelmann, had managed to take control in the newspaper’s staff and publish anti-government articles, calling people for a revolution.

During the 1905 Revolution, Päts was already an activist on self-government reform, where he supported national autonomy in the Baltic governorates. In the escalation of the revolution, his newspaper was closed and its staff members arrested. Päts found out about this in advance and managed to escape to Switzerland, only to find out that he had been condemned to death in the Russian Empire.
In 1906, he moved to Helsinki, Finland, where he continued his literary and journalist career. Much of his work was published anonymously in Estonia. He also advised local municipalities on land reform questions. In 1908, Päts moved to Ollila, which was located at the Russian border near Saint Petersburg. There he became one of the editors for the Estonian newspaper &quot;Peterburi Teataja&quot; (&quot;The St Petersburg Gazette&quot;), although he still resided in Finland. In Ollila, he was reunited with his family, with whom he had parted when he escaped to Switzerland in 1905.

After his wife had become seriously ill, Päts found out that he was no longer condemned to death in the Russian Empire. He moved back to Estonia in 1909, to face only minor charges. From February 1910, he served time in Kresty Prison in Saint Petersburg, while his wife died of tuberculosis in Switzerland, where Päts had sent her for treatment. During his imprisonment, he was able to study foreign languages and write articles, to be published in newspapers. Päts was released on 25 March 1911. The governor of the Governorate of Estonia complained about Päts&#x27;s activity in Estonia in 1905 and pleaded for the government not to let him return. He was banned from living in the Governorates of Estonia and Livonia for six years. However, strong connections with Jaan Poska helped him return to Estonia, where he founded another newspaper, &quot;Tallinna Teataja&quot; (&quot;The Tallinn Gazette&quot;).

From February 1916, Päts served as an officer in Tallinn. In July 1917, he was elected as Chairman of the Supreme Committee of Estonian Soldiers, where he actively worked to form Estonian units in the Imperial Army. During the war, he also organized the cooperation between Estonians and liberal Baltic German estate owners.

===1917–1918: Autonomy and German occupation===

In 1917, when German forces were advancing on Estonia, Päts was able to avoid the mobilization. Since the control after the February Revolution was in the hands of the Russian Provisional Government, Estonians were pursuing for an autonomy within the Russian Empire. In local debates on whether to form one or two autonomous governorates in Estonia, Konstantin Päts, who supported a single autonomous governorate, took yet another victory from Jaan Tõnisson, who supported two autonomous governorates. After Estonian mass protests in Petrograd, the provisional government formed the autonomous Governorate of Estonia on .

The Estonian Provincial Assembly (Maapäev) was elected; Päts joined and became one of the leading figures of the Estonian Country People&#x27;s Union, which took 13 of the 55 seats. Left- and right-wing politicians gained an equal number of seats in the Provincial Assembly, which made it difficult to appoint a speaker for the assembly. Jaan Tõnisson of the centre-right nominated the candidacy of Konstantin Päts, who, however, lost by only one vote to the almost unknown Artur Vallner. At first, Päts chose not to join any of the parliamentary groups, but eventually joined the most right-wing Democratic group. Päts replaced Jaan Raamot as chairman of the provincial government on . During the October Revolution, Bolsheviks took control in Estonia and the Provincial Assembly was disbanded. After failing to give over official documents, Päts was arrested three times, until he finally went underground.

Since the Bolshevik rule in Estonia was relatively weak, the Council of Elders of the Maapäev declared on that the assembly was the only legally elected and constituted authority in Estonia. Since even the Council of Elders was too big to work underground, the three-membered Estonian Salvation Committee was formed on 19 February 1918; and Konstantin Päts became one of its members.

Soviet Russian forces evacuating, the Salvation Committee wanted to use the &quot;interregnum&quot; and declare Estonia&#x27;s independence. On 21 February 1918, a delegation with Päts was sent to Haapsalu, which was chosen to be the site of the initial declaration, but they were forced to head back to Tallinn, since the German forces had captured Haapsalu on the very same day. Attempts to reach Tartu before the German occupation had also failed.

When the Soviet Russian forces had finally evacuated from Tallinn and the German forces were advancing, the Salvation Committee issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918 (the declaration had also been delivered to Pärnu, where it was proclaimed on 23 February). Instantly, the Estonian Provisional Government was formed; and Konstantin Päts became the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Internal Affairs, and the Minister of Commerce and Industry. The position of Minister of Commerce and Industry probably remained vacant in reality.

On 25 February 1918, the German forces captured Tallinn. Konstantin Päts was arrested on 16 June 1918. He was sent to several prison camps in Latvia, until he was finally placed in a camp in Grodno, Poland. He was released at the end of the war on 17 November 1918.

After the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Jüri Vilms mysteriously died in Finland, Jaan Poska led the underground republic. After Germany surrendered, Konstantin Päts&#x27;s 2nd cabinet of the provisional government took office on 12 November 1918, making Päts the Prime Minister of the provisional government and the Minister of Internal Affairs.

After Päts arrived in Tallinn and the Maapäev had gathered, Päts&#x27;s 3rd cabinet of the provisional government was formed on 27 November 1918, with Päts as Prime Minister of the provisional government and also the Minister of War, leaving it up to him to organize national defence. However, due to his multiple portfolios in the government, much of the work in the Ministry of War was delegated to higher officers.

===1918–1920: War of Independence===
On 28 November 1918, the Soviet Russian Red Army invaded Estonia and conquered the border city of Narva, marking the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence. By January 1919, Estonians had forced the Bolsheviks to retreat; and by 24 February 1919, the entire Estonian territory was under the control of the provisional government. In his speech at the 1919 Independence Day parade, Päts said: &quot;We have to secure our economy so we could become less dependent on our allies. In order to avoid bankruptcy, our new state needs a solid foundation of agriculture.&quot;

In April 1919, the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected, but the Estonian Country People&#x27;s Union won only 8 of the 120 seats, leaving the majority to centre-left parties. On 9 May 1919, Otto August Strandman took over as the first Prime Minister. In the summer of 1919, Päts opposed the Estonian intervention into the war against the Baltic German &quot;Landeswehr&quot; in neighboring Latvia, but as he was in opposition and supported only by a small parliamentary minority, the then government decided to start the Landeswehr War, which ended in the Estonian-Latvian victory. After the war with Soviet Russia had also ended with Estonian victory on 2 February 1920, the majority left-wing Constituent Assembly adopted a radical land reform law and the first constitution, which brought about a proportionally representative and very fractured parliament, rapidly changing government cabinets, and a nominal head of state whose office had little more than ceremonial powers only.

===1918–1940: Independent Republic of Estonia===
In September 1919, Päts formed a new political party, the agrarian-conservative Farmers&#x27; Assemblies, which was based on the Country People&#x27;s Union. In 1920 elections, the party won 21 seats in the 100-member Riigikogu and from 25 January 1921 to 21 November 1922, Konstantin Päts was the State Elder and led the first constitutional government cabinet. It was a centre-right coalition with three centrist parties. The cabinet fell soon after the centre-left Estonian Labour Party left the coalition because of Päts&#x27;s right-wing policies and criticism of corruption within the Bank of Estonia. After stepping down as head of government, Päts served as President (speaker) of the Riigikogu from 20 November 1922 to 7 June 1923.

In 1923 elections, Farmers&#x27; Assemblies took 23 seats. On 2 August 1923, Päts became State Elder for the second time. A similar centre-right coalition with three centrist parties lasted again until the Estonian Labour Party left the coalition, forcing Päts to step down on 26 March 1924. Otto August Strandman had openly criticized Päts for his role in corruption within the Bank of Estonia and economic policies that depended on trade with Russia. Päts kept away from office politics for seven years. Support for his party did not decline. From 15 December 1925 to 9 December 1927, Jaan Teemant of the Farmers&#x27; Assemblies was the State Elder.

In 1926 elections, Farmers&#x27; Assemblies took again 23 seats and Jaan Teemant continued as State Elder. Already in 1927, Päts criticized members of the Riigikogu, saying that they had been causing the instability of government coalitions, rather than ideological differences. At the 6th Congress of Farmers&#x27; Assemblies in 1929, the party was in opposition to August Rei&#x27;s leftist government and Päts, among others, demanded changes in the constitution, a smaller parliament, a separate presidential office and fight against corruption.

In 1929 elections, Farmers&#x27; Assemblies took 24 seats and Päts served his third term as State Elder from 12 February 1931 to 19 February 1932. It was an ideologically wide coalition with the Estonian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party and the centre-right Estonian People&#x27;s Party. On 26 January 1932, Farmers&#x27; Assemblies and the left wing-agrarian Settlers&#x27; Party merged to form the Union of Settlers and Smallholders, only to be followed by the formation of the National Centre Party by four centrist parties. Päts&#x27;s cabinet resigned, making Jaan Teemant the new State Elder.

In 1932 elections the newly formed Union of Settlers and Smallholders won 42 seats in Riigikogu and one of the party&#x27;s leaders, Karl August Einbund, became the State Elder. On 3 October 1932, the coalition between the Union of Settlers and Smallholders and National Centre Party broke up, with the latter wanting to devalue the Estonian kroon during the Great Depression. Päts himself was one of the key opponents of devaluation.

A month-long government crisis started. Since there were only three major parties in the parliament, the third being the Estonian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, no functioning coalition could be found until special authority was given to Konstantin Päts to form a grand coalition between all three major parties. His cabinet took office on 1 November 1932. On 25 November 1932, Päts&#x27;s government was given more powers by the disunited Riigikogu to deal with the economic crisis. His government was forced to resign on 18 May 1933, after the National Centre Party, still favouring devaluation, left the coalition and the Union of Settlers and Smallholders had lost many of its members to the reactivated Settlers&#x27; party. The succeeding Tõnisson&#x27;s National Centre Party cabinet devalued the Estonian kroon by 35% on 27 June 1933. Although the devaluation proved to be successful and had a good impact to the economy later under his own rule, Päts never recognized his mistake by opposing the devaluation.

Lack of government stability led to several new constitution proposals, but only the third proposal by the right-wing populist Vaps Movement was accepted in a referendum on 14–16 October 1933. Päts was elected on 21 October 1933 to head the non-aligned transitional government to the second constitution. Until 24 January 1934, he served as State Elder, but after the new constitution came into force, he became Prime Minister. The new constitution was a drift from democracy, giving a lot of power to the head of state (still named &quot;State Elder&quot;) and leaving the Riigikogu only an advisory role.

Both Päts and Tõnisson, his predecessor as head of state, tried to control the Vaps Movement that was seen by democratic parties as a local National Socialist party that had to be kept away from power. In August 1933, State Elder Jaan Tõnisson had declared a state of emergency and temporary censorship, that was lifted only when Päts&#x27;s transitional government took office.

The weak government response only gained support for the Vaps Movement and in early January 1934, the movement won municipal elections in several urban municipalities. On 27 February 1934, Päts himself imposed a law, prohibiting members of the military to take part in politics. This action forced several thousand members of the army to secede from the Vaps Movement.

Päts was one of the candidates in the presidential elections that were supposed to be held in April 1934, but the Vaps Movement candidate Andres Larka and even lieutenant general Johan Laidoner were both clearly more popular candidates than Päts in the public opinion. The campaign was accompanied by threats by the Vaps Movement to take power and rumours of a forthcoming &quot;coup&quot;. In early March 1934, Päts&#x27;s political opponent Jaan Tõnisson compared the Vaps Movement with the Nazis in Germany and advised the government to take necessary action against the movement. Konstantin Päts then carried out a self-coup on 12 March 1934. He was supported by general Johan Laidoner and the army.

A state of emergency was declared and the Vaps Movement was disbanded, with about 400 members arrested, including the presidential candidate Andres Larka. Johan Laidoner was reappointed Commander in Chief of the Army. The period following the self-coup in 1934-1938 has been called by some politicians and historians the &quot;Era of silence&quot; which was marked by some degree of authoritarianism by Päts.

Speaking in the parliament on 15 March 1934, Päts stated that the Estonian people were &quot;blinded by the propaganda of the Vaps Movement and ill-minded because of it, and the power could therefore not be in the hands of the people&quot;. On 15–16 March 1934, the parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;) approved Päts&#x27; actions in hopes of saving Estonian democracy. Päts postponed the presidential elections for the duration of the emergency, expressing concern about &quot;emotions being too high because of anti-government agitation by the Vaps Movement&quot;.

In August 1934, Päts appointed Karl August Einbund as Minister of Internal Affairs, making him the third leading figure of the era next to Päts and Laidoner. In September, the Agitation and Propaganda Department was created, in October, all parliamentary work was suspended after the opposition criticized the political restrictions and in December, censorship was introduced.

In February 1935, the Patriotic League (&quot;Isamaaliit&quot;) was formed to replace political parties, while all other political organizations were suspended in March 1935. Päts stated in his opinions at the time that political organizations should unite the society, not fragment it. The initial state of emergency was declared for six months in March 1934, but after September 1934, Päts extended it for a year in a total of six times.

Päts believed that a nation should be organized not by political views into parties, but by vocation into respective chambers, and a series of state corporative institutions were thus introduced, following in big part the example of contemporary corporatism in Fascist Italy. Päts had promoted the idea of corporate chambers already in 1918, but the idea did not gain support from strong left-wing parties at the time. Päts was the main proponent of the formation of the chambers and the first two were founded while his government cabinets were in office in 1924 and 1931. Fifteen more chambers were established between 1934 and 1936, bringing the total number to 17.

On 7 December 1935, a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; attempt (the &quot;Estonia plot&quot;, named after the Estonia Theatre) by the Vaps Movement was exposed. More than 750 people were arrested throughout the state, crushing the movement conclusively. Leaders of the movement were soon given court sentences as hard as 20 years of forced labour, however they were all pardoned two years later, in December 1937.

Meanwhile, Jaan Tõnisson had criticized Päts&#x27;s inability to bring the new constitution into effect. In July 1935, Tõnisson was ousted from the &quot;Postimees&quot; board. In October 1936, four former State Elders, Juhan Kukk, Ants Piip, Jaan Teemant and Jaan Tõnisson, sent a joint letter to Päts, demanding civil freedoms and restoration of democratic regime. Reluctance to restore democracy also caused student riots in Tartu in the autumn of 1936, which led to clashes with the police and disbandment of the student council of the University of Tartu.

The lack of organized opposition during the emergency made it easier for Päts to pass reforms. Päts ruled mostly through presidential decrees, because the Riigikogu was needed to pass real laws. The economy grew and the infrastructure, industry, and education were developed. The Estonianization of personal names was supported, the most prominent example being Minister of Internal Affairs Karl August Einbund, who changed his name to Kaarel Eenpalu.

Päts also signed a decree to bring the Supreme Court from Tartu to Tallinn in 1935, although all but one of the justices voted against it. After the &quot;coup&quot;, the Supreme Court lost many of its powers and was not able to observe the implementation of democratic principles in the country. Päts also founded the Tallinn Technical Institute on 15 September 1936 as the second university in Estonia. Losing the Supreme Court and some faculties in the university definitely reduced the importance of Tartu in Southern Estonia - the town that had historically been supportive to Päts&#x27;s opponent Jaan Tõnisson.
Regarding the 1934 constitution as too authoritarian, Päts organised the passing of a new constitution through a referendum and a constituent assembly. The corporate chambers were to be the basis of forming the assembly. Its formation was approved (with 76% in favour) in a referendum in 1936. The 1936 National Assembly elections were boycotted by the opposition in most electoral districts.

On 28 July 1937, the assembly adopted the third constitution, that was based on Päts&#x27;s draft. A bicameral parliament was to be elected and the president was to be elected by the parliament, not by the people. On 3 September 1937, a 120-day period of transition began, during which Päts ruled as President-Regent.

On 1 January 1938, the new constitution came into force and the 1938 parliamentary elections were held. Opposition candidates were allowed to take part, however they were given little or no attention in the media. Päts&#x27;s supporters in the National Front for the Implementation of the Constitution won 64 of the 80 seats in the lower chamber, the &quot;Riigivolikogu&quot;. The president, who was yet to be elected, was also able to directly appoint into office 10 of the 40 members of the higher chamber, &quot;Riiginõukogu&quot;.

On 23 April 1938, Konstantin Päts was elected and nominated a presidential candidate by both chambers of the parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;) as well as by the Assembly of Municipal Representatives. Jaan Tõnisson was the only opposition candidate in the parliament&#x27;s lower chamber (&quot;Riigivolikogu&quot;). Of its 80 members, 65 voted for Päts and 14 for Tõnisson. There were no opposition candidates, and no elections necessary, in the upper chamber (&quot;Riiginõukogu&quot;) and in the Assembly of Municipal Representatives, where Päts received 36 from a total of 40 and 113 from a total of 120 votes, respectively. As both chambers of parliament and the Assembly of Municipal Representatives had elected and nominated the same candidate, in accordance with the constitution, a collective electoral body convened on 24 April 1938 and voted with 219 in favor of the candidate, Päts, and 19 ballots left empty. From a total of 240, the 219 votes were more than the required 3/5 majority (144 votes). Päts gave the presidential oath of office in front of the parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;) on the same day, 24 April 1938, thus becoming the first President of Estonia.

On 9 May 1938, Päts appointed Kaarel Eenpalu as Prime Minister. On 5 May 1938, all political prisoners, mostly communists and members of the Vaps Movement, were given amnesty. There is no consensus, whether the so-called &quot;Era of Silence&quot; ended in 1938 with the adoption of the new constitution, or in 1940 with the Soviet occupation. The era of 1934–1940 is generally also called the &quot;Päts Era&quot;. Also in 1938 a general amnesty was granted for those political prisoners of the Vaps Movement and the Communist Party, who had not directly killed anyone.

===1939–1940: World War II, Soviet invasion of Estonia===
After the beginning of World War II Estonia declared its neutrality, but was compelled to sign the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty on 28 September 1939 to allow Soviet military bases and 25,000 troops in Estonia. On 12 October 1939, Päts appointed Jüri Uluots as a new, moderate Prime Minister.

In May 1940, Päts believed that the best option for Estonia would be to follow the Soviet leadership&#x27;s (Stalin&#x27;s) guidelines until the German-Soviet war. In case of such war, &quot;Estonia would be saved&quot;. However, on 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union delivered an ultimatum to the Estonian government. The Estonian government was forced to accept the ultimatum and a full Soviet invasion and occupation of the entire territory of Estonia followed on 17 June 1940.

The Soviet invaders allowed Päts to stay in office, but he was forced already on 21 June 1940 to appoint a new pro-Soviet puppet government with Johannes Vares as prime minister. Päts became effectively a puppet himself, and over the following month he signed nearly 200 decrees issued by the new Stalinist regime. Amongst others, he signed a decree to change the electoral law, allowing the new regime to organize snap elections. This decree to change the law was unconstitutional, since the upper house of the Estonian parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;) had been dissolved and never reconvened. The new Soviet-styled sham elections were held only for the lower chamber (&quot;Riigivolikogu&quot;), with voters being presented with a single list of Communists and fellow travellers. On Victory Day of 23 June 1940, Päts declared: &quot;the greatest thing we have accomplished is the creation of the Estonian state. To her we have given our strongest love, our loyalty, our work, and our life.&quot; From 29 June 1940, Päts remained under permanent house arrest. Even in early July, Päts reportedly informed the German ambassador that he did not believe Estonia would be Sovietized. On 21 July 1940, the new pro-Stalinist &quot;parliament&quot; proclaimed Estonia a &quot;Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; and it is claimed that only then did Päts realize the essence of the Soviet occupation.

===Deportation to Soviet Russia and imprisonment===
On 21 July 1940, Päts sent his son Viktor to visit the United States&#x27; embassy in Tallinn, and to appeal for protection and asylum in the United States for himself and his family. The Acting US Secretary of State, Sumner Welles gave permission for issuing diplomatic visas to the entire Päts family already on the next day. Many Soviet-era sources claim that Päts had resigned from office on 21 July 1940. According to some other sources, he signed the resignation document on 22 July and the resignation was approved on 23 July 1940, making Päts formally the president of the new Estonian &quot;Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; for two days. Regardless of the exact chronology, the then pro-Soviet prime minister Vares, took over the president&#x27;s powers as &quot;Prime Minister in duties of the President&quot; as a mere formality and for only a few weeks. 
Either the American visas came too late or the Päts family remained under house arrest, but on 30 July 1940, together with his son Viktor and Viktor&#x27;s wife Helgi-Alice and sons Matti and Henn, Konstantin Päts was deported to Ufa, Russia, where they arrived on 9 August. There they lived under surveillance in a large apartment at 37 Komunisticheskaya Street for a year. In Ufa, Päts wrote his memoirs of his time in office and pleaded that his grandsons, their mother, and nanny would be sent to either Switzerland or Italy, since his grandson Henn was already in a bad health. After receiving no answer, he pleaded for them to be sent back to Estonia. In his naivety, he pleaded to be exchanged with Ernst Thälmann, former leader of the Communist Party of Germany, who was imprisoned in Germany. After that, Päts remained quiet, while his son Viktor was certain that Nazi Germany would invade the Soviet Union and that he would soon be living abroad.

The family &quot;randomly&quot; met an Estonian couple, both NKVD agents, in an Ufa market on 29 May 1941. They received an invitation to the family&#x27;s home the next day. After the visit, it was claimed that both Konstantin and Viktor demonstrated particular viciousness against Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov, sympathized with Germany, and announced that they were impatiently waiting for a German assault on the Soviet Union.
On 26 June 1941, they were arrested and imprisoned in Ufa, the children were sent to an orphanage. Päts was interrogated for hours, but did not take the blame. Even in March 1942, he believed that the Western powers would pressure the Soviet Union to send him abroad. Eventually, Päts and his son were sent to Butyrka prison in Moscow and Helgi-Alice to Gulag prison camps in Siberia. In Butyrka prison, Johan Laidoner was prisoner No. 11, Konstantin Päts No. 12 and Viktor No. 13.

On 24 March 1943, Päts was sent to forced treatment in psychoneurotic hospitals first in Kazan, then in Chistopol in Tatar ASSR. His forced psychiatric hospitalization was justified by his &quot;persistent claiming of being the President of Estonia&quot;. On 29 April 1952, Päts was found guilty according to § 58-14 and § 58-10 of the Penal Code, which meant counter-revolutionary sabotage and anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary propaganda and agitation. Forced treatment was ended in 1954 and Päts was sent to a psychoneurology hospital in Jämejala, Estonia. Recognition by the locals and too much attention resulted in him being sent to Burashevo psychiatric hospital in Kalinin Oblast (now Tver Oblast), where he eventually died on 18 January 1956.

==Commercial and social activities==
Between 1919 and 1933, Päts was chairman of the insurance company &quot;Estonian Lloyd&quot;. From 1925 to 1929, Päts was chairman of the council of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and continued as its honorary councillor from 1935. He also served as the chairman of the board of the Harju Bank and chairman of the Tallinn Exchange Committee.

Päts was among the founders of Estonian Sports Association Kalev in 1901 and also its first deputy chairman. Päts was the chairman of Estonian-Finnish-Hungarian Association from 1925 to 1936 and continued as honorary chairman from 1936. From 1927 to 1937, he was the chairman of the &quot;Fenno-Ugria&quot; foundation.

Päts received honorary doctorates from Tartu University in 1928, Tallinn Technical University and Andhra University (in India) in 1938, along with honorary membership of the Learned Estonian Society in 1938 and the Estonian Academy of Sciences in 1939. In 1938, he became honorary member of the Estonian Naturalists&#x27; Society and the Estonian Institute of Natural Resources. He was also named honorary alumnus of the student corps Fraternitas Estica and honorary citizen of the cities of Tallinn, Narva, Pärnu, and Tartu, as well as of his native Tahkuranna Parish.

==Foreign relations==

In 1918, Päts made an informal proposal for an Estonian-Finnish personal union. The contemporary leaders of independent Finland were not sufficiently interested in the union and the idea was effectively ignored and forgotten. Päts still bore the idea in his mind, as testified by his so-called &quot;political testament&quot;, written in July 1940. In 1922, during his first term as State Elder, he made the first Estonian official state visit, to Finland. Päts championed &quot;kindred friendship&quot; with other Finno-Ugric nations, namely Finland and Hungary, and was on the board that wrote the statute of the World Congress of Finno-Ugric Peoples that was ratified on March 24, 1927. He also made unofficial visits to Finland in 1931, 1935 and 1937. President of Finland, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud visited Päts in Estonia twice, in 1934 and in 1936.
In 1933, Päts also made a state visit to Latvia and the treaty of &quot;Baltic Entente&quot; between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania was signed in 1934. This agreement apparently was also another unsuccessful attempt to draw Finland closer to Estonia. During the 1930s, Estonian and Polish officials made several state visits to both countries.

In late 1930s, as the Stalinist Soviet Union took a more aggressive interest in the Baltic countries, Estonia attempted to move closer to Germany in its foreign policy. This change was marked by the 1936 appointment of Friedrich Akel (former foreign minister) as the Estonian ambassador to Germany On 3 December 1938, the Estonian government officially declared the country&#x27;s neutrality in the event of any military conflicts in Europe.

==Criticism==

Several aspects of Päts&#x27;s career are still under critical public debate and various theories have been created, although many of them have also seen broad criticism. For example Päts economic activities and business contacts with Soviet Russia have drawn significant criticism. In 1920–1922 Estonia had more extensive relations with Soviet Russia than with other European countries. The Russian embassy in Tallinn was at the center of Russian gold sales to the West, which constituted about 4% of global gold sales in that period. Estonia and the Bank of Estonia received about 2/3 of the at least 30 million gold rubles transaction fees. The transactions were kept secret and mostly only the Director of the Bank of Estonia in 1920–1921 and Minister of Finance in 1921–1922, Georg Westel, and the State Elder in 1921–1922, Konstantin Päts, knew of these transactions.

Even more, it was the Harju Bank that belonged among others to Päts and Westel that transacted many of the gold sales. Päts, Westel and other big businessmen, mostly members of Päts&#x27;s Farmers&#x27; Unions party, have thus been accused of using this transaction money for their own good. It has also been claimed that the Bank of Estonia gave out several loans to enterprises that were related to Päts&#x27;s activities and almost all other loans were given to enterprises related to the members of the bank&#x27;s own council and other top-level politicians. Having big loans was also the reason why Päts, Westel and other top-level politicians did not fight the hyperinflation at the time.

The gold exchange and big loans also boosted money circulation in Estonia, which created an illusion for the wider public that the economy of Estonia and the Estonian mark were in a good situation. It was only in December 1923 when former Prime Minister Otto Strandman of the Estonian Labour Party criticized the Minister of Finance Georg Vestel in the parliament for incorrect spending of state treasury. Westel was divested of office and Strandman&#x27;s criticism led to the eventual resignation of Päts&#x27;s 2nd cabinet in 1924 and led Päts to distance himself from public politics for seven years. Otto Strandman became Minister of Finance in 1924. He implemented his New Economic Policy (&quot;uus majanduspoliitika&quot;) of economic redevelopment, which stabilized the Estonian mark and detached the Estonian economy from dependence of trade with Russia. Dependence on Russia and hyperinflation could have affected the social situation in Estonia crucially, especially in the light of 1 December 1924 communist coup d&#x27;état attempt.

While Päts has been seen by some as a politician who &quot;destroyed democracy&quot; with the 1934 self-coup, many Estonians today understand the threat the Vaps Movement could have caused to democracy and internal and external security. Furthermore, the &quot;coup&quot; was initially recommended by Päts&#x27; political opponent Jaan Tõnisson himself, and was supported by the democratically elected parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;). as well as the moderate wing of the Estonian Socialist Party.

According to some historians however, Päts and his close allies used the 1934 &quot;coup&quot; for their own personal gains and not to keep the Vaps Movement from taking power. Several members of the Päts family gained important positions ranging from clerical to cultural fields. Others have criticized the long time it took to adopt a new constitution, which was more than three years.

Päts was generally considered to be a rather &quot;modest man&quot; for a politician. He has been criticised for undue self-promotion: For example, during his own rule, he was awarded with several state decorations. He was nominated honorary citizen of some larger Estonian towns and some parishes. During the years of his presidency, the official state celebrations of the Estonian Independence Day began the day before, on Päts&#x27;s birthday. Päts was also the first and only person in interwar Estonia, who had postage stamps with his picture made and circulated, starting from 1936.

In 1938, Päts created a labor camp in Harku for homeless people and other &quot;asocials&quot;.

In 2017, a memorial to Päts was planned for the park on the south side of the Toompea Castle, but the country&#x27;s president at the time, Kersti Kaljulaid, criticised the decision, saying:

Päts&#x27; actions prior to, and around the time of, the 1940 Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia have been questioned. Apparently, in 1918, Päts refused to compromise with the Soviet communists, but in 1940, he &quot;handed over&quot; Estonia to the same Soviet communists without many objections — this controversy has led to theories, that Päts was either a Soviet agent, a collaborator, took the Soviet invasion as inevitable or was just ill-minded and failed to deal with the situation.

One of the more prominent modern critics of Päts, Magnus Ilmjärv, has suggested that Soviet Russia sought since the 1920s to literally buy off some of the top-level Estonian politicians. He suggests that the Soviets saw Päts and his conservative Farmers&#x27; Assemblies party to be the most suitable. The easiest way to influence Päts and his party is said to have been the Estonian-Russian Chamber of Commerce. Päts was secretly very Russian-minded, as he grew up in a Russian-speaking home. Ilmjärv even claims that Päts had suggested federation between Estonia and the Soviet Union to the Soviet embassy in Tallinn.

Ilmjärv claims that Päts was against any &quot;Baltic Union&quot; that was propagated by the Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kaarel Robert Pusta. Päts is even documented to have said to the Soviet ambassador that he was against politicians like Pusta and he desired to create a new constitution that would reduce the power of the Riigikogu. Through Päts, the Soviet Union is said to have gotten Pusta out of government cabinet and with him, also end the ideas of a united Baltic state.

It is also claimed that Päts purposefully gave up valuable information to the Soviets, when he negotiated the Estonian-Russian commerce treaty for Estonia. Päts also supported giving concession rights of the Narva River hydroelectric power plant to the German enterprise Siemens-Schuckert Werke that already had many projects in Russia and was influenced by it.

An Estonian oil syndicate became a joint Estonian-Soviet enterprise in 1928 and Päts was hired by it as a legal consultant in 1930. His annual salary was $4,000, which was twice as much as the State Elder earned and more than eight times as much as Päts earned as a member of parliament. The purpose of the joint enterprise for the Soviets was not supposed to be business-related, but only to attract Päts. This official salary by the Soviet Union has thus been seen as the salary for his long-term cooperation with the Soviets. After Päts&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, the Soviet Union increased economic cooperation with Estonian enterprises.

Other theories maintain that Päts trusted the Soviet officials and had befriended some of the Soviet leaders. It is also possible, that the NKVD controlled Päts&#x27;s health or the information that reached him. Finnish historian Martti Turtola claims that Päts&#x27;s actions were in accordance with the Soviet Union&#x27;s demands already since the signing of the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty on 28 September 1939 and he did not even once try to find more suitable compromises.

It is also suggested that Päts&#x27;s bad health and loneliness did not let him realistically analyze the situation. Furthermore, it is suggested that Päts and his cabinet lacked the necessary knowledge in international affairs and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany may have come as a shock to the Päts cabinet.

Another theory suggests, that Päts knew of the outbreaking war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and was only looking for a way for Estonia to survive the short period in between. It is suggested that Päts knew of the difficulty of the situation and tried to keep Estonians as safe as possible by avoiding war with the Soviets and buying time. While trying not to give the Soviet Union a chance to punish the Estonians, he also continuously postponed the mobilization, which eventually never even took place, unlike in Latvia and Lithuania in 1939–1940. Under international law a war would have invalidated the Tartu Peace Treaty. As a lawyer, he also had to understand that his decisions were not valid when forced by an occupying power.

==Legacy==
Konstantin Päts was relatively successful in internal politics. After adopting the constitution, his party was in all the government cabinets, except for Friedrich Karl Akel&#x27;s and August Rei&#x27;s cabinets and Jaan Tõnisson&#x27;s fourth cabinet. This makes it 4,017 days (89%) in the government (of 4,497 in 1921–1933). Päts was himself the State Elder four times, a total of 1,476 days (33%). He never filled any other position in the government besides the head of government (except for the additional minister portfolios in the provisional government).

Päts served as the chairman of the Farmers&#x27; Assemblies party only unofficially and he was considered to be a bad partisan and often formed the opposition within the party. Therefore, he seldom took part of their official meetings. Only in 1933, he was made honorary chairman of the party.

Membership in the parliament:
* 1917–1919 Estonian Provincial Assembly (Maapäev)
* 1919–1920 Estonian Constituent Assembly
* 1920–1923 I Riigikogu
* 1923–1926 II Riigikogu
* 1926–1929 III Riigikogu
* 1929–1932 IV Riigikogu
* 1932–1934/1937 V Riigikogu

Päts&#x27;s ideology went through major changes during his career. During the 1905 Revolution, he was considered a socialist, as he advocated progressive ideas that were considered socialist at the time. During his exile years, he became more of a social liberal, trying to use the best of both ideologies. By the time Estonia became independent, he had become a conservative, and showed influences of statism during his authoritarian years.

According to international law and the Estonian constitution, Päts&#x27;s actions were of no effect from the beginning of the occupation, or at least from 21 June 1940, when Andrei Zhdanov forced him to appoint a puppet cabinet led by Johannes Vares. Estonia&#x27;s official position since the end of the Soviet era has been that the laws passed by the Vares cabinet and promulgated by Päts were void in any case as they were not ratified by the parliament&#x27;s upper chamber, the National Council (&quot;Riiginõukogu&quot;), as required by the constitution. The National Council was dissolved soon after the occupation and was never reconvened. According to testimony from Rei, under the Estonian constitution, the Chamber of Deputies &quot;had no legislative power&quot; without the National Council.

Legally, Päts remained the &quot;de jure&quot; President until his death in 1956. From 1940 onward, his active duties went to the last pre-occupation Prime Minister Jüri Uluots, who let Otto Tief form a government in 1944, before the Soviet reoccupation. After Uluots died in Stockholm in 1945, presidential duties went to the oldest member of Tief&#x27;s cabinet, August Rei, who formed the Estonian Government in Exile in 1953. The last Prime Minister in duties of the President, Heinrich Mark, handed over his credentials to the incoming President Lennart Georg Meri on 8 October 1992.

A number of places and institutions in Estonia have been named after Konstantin Päts. Kentmanni street in Tallinn was named after Konstantin Päts in 1939–1940 and 1941–1944 and Lossi street in Põltsamaa was named after him in 1936–1940. Konstantin Päts Boarding School of Tallinn was opened after Päts&#x27;s own initiative for children with respiratory disorders. During Päts&#x27;s presidency, he had the creamy &quot;&quot;Staatspräsident&quot; Päts&quot; rose cultivar named after him and the flowers are being grown in the Kadriorg Park in Tallinn, near the presidential palace.

A museum of Konstantin Päts was set up in 1991 in the Tallinn Botanical Gardens, where Päts&#x27;s farmstead remains. The museum still exists, but the farmstead was returned to Päts&#x27;s descendants in 1995.

Päts has been portrayed in literature, one of the best known is the satirical &quot;Memoirs of Ivan Orav&quot; by Andrus Kivirähk, where Päts is portrayed as a true people&#x27;s person, who was beloved by the entire nation and who was a thoroughly good person. In the puppet political satire show &quot;Pehmed ja karvased&quot; Päts is portrayed as a talking bust sculpture that is placed in the cellar of a governmental building together with other former presidents. Periods of Päts&#x27;s life as a side character were also portrayed in the television series &quot;Tuulepealne maa&quot;.

==Remains==

In 1988, Estonians Henn Latt and Valdur Timusk decided to search for Konstantin Päts&#x27;s remains in Russia. They reached Burashevo village, 15 km from Kalinin (now Tver), where Päts had been a patient in the hospital. They met his last doctor Ksenya Gusseva, who described Päts&#x27;s funeral in 1956. She said that Päts was buried like a president – in a coffin, unlike other deceased patients of the time. On 22 June 1990, his grave was dug up and the remains were reburied in Tallinn Metsakalmistu cemetery on 21 October 1990. In 2011, a commemorative cross was placed in Burashevo village, where Päts was once buried.

==Personal life==

In 1901, Konstantin Päts married Wilhelma (&quot;Helma&quot;) Ida Emilie Peedi (b. 1878), whom he had met in Pärnu High School. They had two sons, Leo and Viktor. Konstantin left his family for exile in 1905; and his second son was born while he still resided in Switzerland. They were united when Konstantin moved to Ollila, Finland. His wife died of lung disease in 1910 while he was imprisoned in Saint Petersburg, and Päts never remarried. His children were raised by his wife&#x27;s unmarried sister Johana (Johanna) Wilhelmine Alexsandra Peedi. Konstantin Päts also had at least one godson.

Päts was seen as a kind person, who was able to give good speeches and who had grown up in a rural area and therefore had a heart for the land. He took a special interest in issues related to children. He often donated money to large families and schools and organized events for students, which he also took part in. He was also known to take long walks in the morning in the Kadriorg park around the Presidential Palace and to get into conversations with park workers. Konstantin Päts had diabetes.

In 1919, Päts rented, organized, and later bought a farmstead on the land detached from Väo Manor, just outside Tallinn. He was later awarded a farmstead, like many other participants of and contributors to the Estonian War of Independence. His farmstead, however, was in Kloostrimetsa, in a prime location just outside Tallinn. Currently located within the Tallinn Botanic Garden, the farmstead has been returned to Päts&#x27;s descendants.

==Descendants==
Konstantin&#x27;s eldest son, Leo Päts (1902–1988), managed to escape to Finland in 1939. He eventually moved on to Sweden, where he died in 1988. Konstantin&#x27;s second son, Viktor Päts (1906–1952), died in Butyrka prison in Moscow on 4 March 1952. Viktor&#x27;s sons Henn (Enn; 1936–1944) and Matti (b. 1933-2024) were sent to an orphanage in 1941 but were soon separated. They were united once a week, until Henn died of starvation in Matti&#x27;s arms in 1944.

All living descendants of Konstantin Päts are the children and grandchildren of Matti Päts, who returned from Russia with his mother Helgi-Alice in 1946. Helgi-Alice, however, was arrested again in 1950 and sentenced to 10 years in prison in Kazakh SSR and returned in 1955. Matti Päts has been the director of the Estonian Patent Office since 1991; he has also been a member of the Riigikogu and Tallinn city council. He was even seen as a potential candidate for the 2001 Presidential election by the conservative wing of the Pro Patria Union.

<text>Biella (; ; ) is a city and (municipality) in the northern Italian region of Piedmont, the capital of the province of the same name, with a population of 44,324 as of 31 December 2017. It is located about northeast of Turin and at about the same distance west-northwest of Milan.

It lies in the foothills of the Alps, in the Bo mountain range near Mt. Mucrone and Camino, an area rich in springs and lakes fed by the glaciers, the heart of the Biellese Alps irrigated by several mountain streams: the Elvo to the west of the town, the Oropa river and the Cervo to the east. Nearby natural and notable tourist attractions include the Zegna Viewpoint, the Bielmonte Ski Resort, Burcina Natural Reserve, and the moors to the south of town. The Sanctuary of Oropa is a site of religious pilgrimages. In 2003, the Sanctuary of Oropa Sacred Mountain of Oropa became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Biella is an important wool processing and textile centre. There is a small airport in the nearby comune of Cerrione.

==History==

===Origins===
The first inhabitants of the area were Ligurians and Celts. This has been ascertained from archaeological finds: they lived near streams and lakes, at first as fishermen and hunters, and later, herders.

A Ligurian people, the Victimuli, fanned out in the plain of Biella (the &quot;Bessa&quot;) and exploited gold veins near the Elvo, an activity which continued through the early Middle Ages, and even today panning for gold continues as a local hobby.

Tools and necklaces dating from the Bronze Age—or, according to some, Iron Age— attesting to Biella&#x27;s antiquity, were found in the Burcina Reserve.

===Middle Ages===
The city&#x27;s name appears for the first time as &quot;Bugella&quot; in a document of 826AD, recording the donation of Bugella to Count Busone by Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne), Holy Roman Emperor; a further document of 882AD records some land transactions of Charles the Fat in favour of the church of Vercelli.

In the 10th century the town was inhabited by Alemanni, Lombards and Franks, who built the first walls as a defence against barbarian invasions. Extant remains from this period include the Lombard Romanesque Baptistry and the adjacent church of S. Stefano, around which the town grew: it is today&#x27;s cathedral, although the original 5th-century building was demolished in 1872.

On April 12, 1160, Uguccione, bishop of Vercelli, granted important trade privileges to anyone residing on Piazzo hill (elevated section of the city) as an incentive to the establishment of a place of refuge against the warfare between the Guelphs and Ghibellines of Vercelli: this was the birth of the Borgo del Piazzo, site of the handsome public square, the Piazza Cisterna, and a Palace fronting it, the doors of which have stone capitals and terracotta ornaments.

Bishop Uguccione&#x27;s castle was destroyed in a revolt in 1377 that led to the subjection of Biella, along with its dependent &quot;comuni&quot;, to the yoke of the House of Savoy.

===Modern times===

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Visconti family competed with Savoy for the possession of the Biella region. The 17th century saw a similar competition between French and Spanish forces, and Biella was actually occupied in 1704; in 1706 Pietro Micca, a Biellese soldier, saved nearby Turin from a siege that would have meant the invasion of Biella by the French as well—but paid for it with his own life.

In 1798 Biella was once again occupied by the French, and after the Battle of Marengo, Biella was formally annexed by France. The Congress of Vienna returned it to Savoy.

In 1859 Biella was besieged by the Austrians but Garibaldi forced an end to the siege, and the town became part of the province of Novara, losing its status as regional capital that it had received in the 17th century from Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy; it was transferred to the province of Vercelli in 1927.

In World War II Biella was the scene of armed resistance.

In 1992, the new province of Biella was formed, separating the territory from the north-western sector of the province of Vercelli.

===Wool industry===
In 1245 the statutes of Biella were already referring to the wool workers&#x27; and weavers&#x27; guilds: hardly surprising given the region&#x27;s high mountain pastures and copious water supply needed for washing fleece and powering mills. In the 17th and 18th centuries, as elsewhere in Italy, silk was an important industry, and a silk factory was built in the town in 1695. In 1835, however, the town&#x27;s textile history came round full circle when the same building was put to use as a wool factory with the introduction of mechanical looms, putting Biella at the forefront of modern improvements in the industry. Around 1999/2000, a progressively worse economic crisis in the wool sector forced many local wool mills to close since they could not compete with the prices of imported fabrics and clothing.

===Culture===
Biella is the home of Citta dell&#x27;arte (City of the Arts) - Fondazione Pistoletto. In 1994, Italian artist Michelangelo Pistoletto began Progetto Arte, whose aim was to unify the artistic, creative, and social-economic aspects (e.g. fashion, theatre, design, etc.). In 1996, he founded City of Arts/Citta dell&#x27;arte – Fondazione Pistoletto in a formally unused textile factory near Biella, as a centre supporting and researching creative resources, producing innovative ideas and possibilities. The Citta dell&#x27;arte is divided into different Uffici/Offices (work, education, communications, art, nutrition, politics, spirituality, and economics).

A second railway station, Biella Chiavazza, is in the district of Chiavazza, a short distance along the line towards Novara. The Biella funicular connects a lower station on &quot;Via Curiel&quot;, in the city&#x27;s &quot;Biella Piano&quot; quarter, with an upper station on &quot;Via Avogadro&quot; in the city&#x27;s medieval &quot;Biella Piazzo&quot; quarter.

<text>Gordon Van Gelder (born 1966) is an American science fiction editor. From 1997 until 2014, Van Gelder was editor and later publisher of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, for which he has twice won the Hugo Award for Best Editor Short Form. He was also a managing editor of &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot; from 1988 to 1993, for which he was nominated for the Hugo Award a number of times. In 2015, Van Gelder stepped down as editor of &quot;Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in favor of Charles Coleman Finlay, but remains publisher of the magazine.

==Biography==
He was born in 1966. After graduating from Princeton University (where he edited a science fiction magazine called &quot;Infinity&quot;), Van Gelder started working as an editorial assistant at St. Martin&#x27;s Press in 1988, later rising to full editor. In January 1997, he became the editor of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; upon the resignation of Kristine Kathryn Rusch. He continued working at St. Martin&#x27;s until October 2000, when he bought the magazine from Edward L. Ferman to become its publisher.

During his tenure, &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; became the second longest-running science fiction magazine, surpassing &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in total number of issues published. It is exceeded only by &quot;Astounding/Analog&quot;. Van Gelder also began focusing on the publication of themed anthologies drawing from the magazine&#x27;s back list rather than the best-of annuals published when Ferman was the magazine&#x27;s publisher. He later edited a collection of notable stories from F&amp;SF, &quot;The Very Best of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, published by Tachyon Publications.

Van Gelder has made some behind-the-scenes changes to &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. While the Fermans published the magazine through Mercury Press, Van Gelder founded his own press, Spilogale Inc., named for a genus of spotted skunk. He has also moved the editorial offices from New York City to Jersey City, New Jersey. Van Gelder currently lives in Hoboken, New Jersey. He has been an administrator of the Philip K. Dick Award since 1995 and an administrator of the World Fantasy Award since 2014. In 2011, OR Books released an anthology edited by Van Gelder, &quot;Welcome to the Greenhouse: Science Fiction on Climate Change&quot;, with an introduction by journalist Elizabeth Kolbert.

==Family==
Richard Van Gelder, his father, was Curator of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. Lawrence Van Gelder, an uncle of Van Gelder, was a senior editor at &quot;The New York Times&quot; until his retirement in 2008.

Van Gelder is also distantly related to noted jazz recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder.
