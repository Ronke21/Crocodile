<text>The Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies are an American swing and ska band established in Eugene, Oregon, in 1989. Formed by singer-songwriter Steve Perry and bassist Dan Schmid, the band has experienced numerous personnel changes over the course of its 30-year history, with only Perry, Schmid and trumpeter Dana Heitman currently remaining from the original founding lineup.

The Daddies&#x27; music is primarily a mix of swing and ska, contrastingly encompassing both traditional jazz-influenced variations of the genres as well as contemporary rock and punk hybrids, characterized by a prominent horn section and Perry&#x27;s acerbic and innuendo-laced lyricism often concerning dark or political subject matter. While the band&#x27;s earliest releases were mostly grounded in punk and funk rock, their later studio albums have since incorporated elements from many diverse genres of popular music and Americana into their sound, including rockabilly, rhythm and blues, soul and world music.

Initially drawing both acclaim and controversy as a preeminent regional band, the Daddies gained wider recognition touring nationally within the American ska scene before ultimately breaking into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;. Released at the peak of the 1990s swing revival, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement. By the end of the decade, however, interest in the swing revival had swiftly declined, along with the band&#x27;s commercial popularity. The resultant failure of their subsequent album &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; contributed to an abrupt hiatus in 2000.

The Daddies officially regrouped in 2002 to resume part-time touring, eventually returning to recording with the independently released &quot;Susquehanna&quot; in 2008. Their twelfth album, the swing and jazz-influenced &quot;At the Pink Rat&quot;, was released in July 2024.
==History==

=== Formation ===

Following his high school graduation in 1981, Steve Perry left his hometown of Binghamton, New York, for Eugene, Oregon, to pursue track and field and a chemistry degree at the University of Oregon. A punk rock devotee since adolescence, Perry soon became engrossed in Eugene&#x27;s underground music scene, where he eventually met and befriended musician and fellow University student Dan Schmid. Sharing similar musical ambitions and a mutual disinterest in school, the pair agreed to drop out of college together and start a band, forming the punk trio The Jazz Greats in 1983, which evolved into the Paisley Underground-styled garage rock group Saint Huck, which lasted from 1984 to 1987.

As the rise of grunge began to phase punk and hardcore out of the Northwest underground by the late 1980s, Perry set out to start a band that stood in defiant contrast to the shoegazing attitude of alternative rock, showcasing high energy dance music and Zappa-esque theatricality in an attempt to create something that an audience would react to viscerally instead of passively. Recruiting a horn section led by alto saxophonist Brooks Brown, Perry and Schmid formed their latest band Mr. Wiggles – named so after a Parliament song – in November 1988, playing their first show in Springfield as part of a benefit concert for workers of the Nicolai door manufacturing plant, who were then engaged in a union strike.

&quot;My conception of punk&quot;, Perry told &quot;The Rocket&quot;, &quot;was doing whatever the hell you wanted as long as it had vitality and wasn&#x27;t overly stupid ... something exploratory and experimental&quot;, citing influence from genre-bending bands such as The Clash and the Meat Puppets. In their earliest incarnation, Mr. Wiggles played punk-inflected funk and soul music, though Perry&#x27;s songwriting soon grew to draw heavily from a newfound interest in jazz, swing and rhythm and blues, combining punk rock and jazz arrangements in what Perry described was a desire to contemporize American roots music by infusing it with punk energy and using modernist, socially aware lyricism.

===Early years (1989–1993)===
In 1989, the title of Mr. Wiggles was retired when the band switched to a new name, &quot; Daddies&quot;, derived from jive slang the members had overheard on a vintage race record. The band played their first show as the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies at the W.O.W. Hall in Eugene on March 31.
The Daddies sought to differentiate themselves from other Northwest rock bands of the era by having a horn section, featuring outlandish stage theatrics, and encouraging their audiences to dance. As Perry spoke of the Daddies&#x27; ideology, &quot;It was our way of saying &#x27;screw you&#x27; [to alternative rock &#x27;phoniness&#x27;] ... we wanted to have fun, outrageously have a good blast without even thinking about it&quot;. Nonetheless, by the end of 1989, the Daddies had built a strong and loyal following within Eugene&#x27;s counterculture, frequently selling out show and gathering critical acclaim.&quot;

The Daddies recorded their first demo cassette &quot;4 From On High&quot; in July 1989, which included four tracks of funk rock and punk-influenced swing. The cassette sold over 1,000 copies in the Eugene and Portland areas, enabling the band to self-produce their debut LP &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot;, released the following year. Fusing punk rock and jazz horns with funk grooves, &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot; drew favorable critical comparisons to contemporaries Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers while also becoming a regional best seller. The album set a record for advance sales in Eugene&#x27;s record stores and remained for over a year on &quot;The Rocket&quot;&#x27;s Northwest Top Twenty list. The album helped expand the Daddies&#x27; Northwestern touring reach to as far as Alaska and Los Angeles by 1992.

====Controversies and censorship====
Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies&#x27; early performances often included flamboyant costumes, go-go dancers, phallic stage scenery, prop-heavy skits, or choreographed dance numbers. Perry—then performing under his mad scientist stage persona of &quot;MC Large Drink&quot;—would regularly engage in absurdist shock rock stunts, such as mock crucifixion and flag burning. One of the band&#x27;s stage props was known as the &quot;Dildorado&quot; or &quot;The Dildozer&quot;, a riding lawnmower modified to look like a human penis that mimicked ejaculation by shooting colorful fluids from its tip.

The band attracted controversy from Feminist groups, who condemned the band&#x27;s performances as pornographic, citing their name and sexually charged lyricism as a promotion of sexism and misogyny. Perry disputed such claims, defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire. In what &quot;Eugene Weekly&quot; called &quot;the most hotly discussed topic in the local music scene&quot; and &quot;the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [and] free speech&quot;, the Daddies experienced controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career. Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band&#x27;s posters and sought boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review. The Daddies&#x27; concerts routinely became sites of organized picketing and, on one occasion, a bomb threat. The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail, threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw a cup of hot coffee in his face as he was walking down the street.

The Daddies initially refused to change their name on the grounds of artistic freedom, but a number of venues refused to book them due to the negative publicity. The band was temporarily banned from the W.O.W. Hall, where they had previously served as house band. The group later bowed to community pressure, and performed under the name &quot;The Daddies&quot;, &quot;The Bad Daddies,&quot; and similar variations within Eugene, but performed under their original name while touring elsewhere. As the Daddies retired the theatrical elements from their later live shows, the controversies surrounding the band waned and they returned to using their full name everywhere. Some minor complaints resurfaced during their mainstream success in the late 1990s.

===National touring and independent success (1994–1996)===
Throughout the early 1990s, the Daddies continued to remain a reliably popular and profitable draw in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California club circuit. Despite earning critical accolades from the local music press, including winning &quot;SF Weekly&quot;″s title of &quot;Best Unsigned Band&quot; in 1994, the Daddies struggled to achieve wider recognition and distribution. Following a number of changes in their member and managerial lineups, the group embarked on their first national tour in the fall of 1994, which was highlighted by a set at the CMJ Music Marathon festival and convention in New York City. Upon returning to Eugene without any advantageous deals, the Daddies instead bought and constructed their own independent record label and recording studio, Space Age Bachelor Pad Records, where they self-produced and self-recorded their second studio album, &quot;Rapid City Muscle Car&quot;, which was released in December 1994. Described by Perry as &quot;an idea album&quot; and &quot;very psychedelic&quot;, &quot;Rapid City Muscle Car&quot; was a distinct departure from the upbeat dance music vibe of &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot;, showcasing a diverse range of disparate genres including ska punk, psychedelic rock, country, rockabilly, big band, hard rock and lounge. While Perry has retrospectively cited &quot;Rapid City Muscle Car&quot; as his personal favorite Daddies album, he revealed in a 1995 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the album sold &quot;okay&quot; but ultimately didn&#x27;t surpass sales of &quot;Ferociously Stoned&quot;.

The Daddies began dedicating themselves to full-time touring in 1995, playing over 200 shows across two or three national tours per year, including spots at prominent music festivals such as South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. As the band gradually built fanbases and markets around the country, they began attracting interest from several high-profile record labels, among which reportedly included Hollywood Records and producers including Roy Thomas Baker and Terry Ellis. However, when the suggestion or stipulation was made that the Daddies stick to one genre, Perry invariably rejected these offers, not wanting any outside influences controlling the band&#x27;s sound. In a similar mindset, not wishing to be pigeon-holed into any specific scene or genre, Perry at first refused to tour with ska bands, though after a highly successful and well-received tour with Fresno ska band Let&#x27;s Go Bowling, he acquiesced, and the Daddies eventually carved out a lucrative niche within the national ska scene, forming regular touring partnerships with the likes of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish and Less Than Jake.

While the mainstream&#x27;s growing focus on punk and ska by the mid-1990s presented the Daddies with further commercial opportunities, Perry still insisted foremost on maintaining complete creative control of the band. In February 1996, the Daddies released their third self-produced studio album on Space Age Bachelor Pad, &quot;Kids on the Street&quot;. Another musical departure from their previous record, &quot;Kids on the Street&quot; was mostly a reflection of the band&#x27;s growing punk and ska influences, eschewing the Daddies&#x27; trademark brassy funk and swing in favor of guitar-driven rock, punk and ska, as well as stylistic detours into jazz and country. Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, &quot;Kids on the Street&quot; wound up becoming the Daddies&#x27; most successful release at the time, staying on &quot;The Rocket&quot;″s Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and even working its way onto &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Alternative Charts.

===&quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; and major label years (1997–1999)===

By late 1996, ska had broken through into the American mainstream as one of the most popular forms of alternative music, catapulting such major label bands as Reel Big Fish and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones into the national spotlight. The Daddies, however, without the support of a record label, were ultimately left on the fringes of commercial visibility. Although &quot;Kids on the Street&quot; had sold well for an independent release, the band had continuing difficulty securing press and distribution outside of the Northwest, while the pressure of full-time touring was inevitably becoming both a personal and financial strain on the members. The Daddies experienced at least fifteen lineup changes from 1996 to 1997, including the departure of original keyboardist Chris Azorr and co-founder Dan Schmid, leaving only Perry and trumpeter Dana Heitman as the sole remnants of the original lineup. Feeling they had finally hit a as an independent band, Perry said the Daddies were left with one of two options at this time: either sign to a label or break up.

Despite primarily playing ska tours during this turbulent period of their career, the Daddies suddenly began attracting a sizable and enthusiastic audience for their swing music, owing heavily to the coincident public interest in the formerly underground swing revival movement due in part to the success of the 1996 film &quot;Swingers&quot;. Although the Daddies had occasionally played shows with notable swing revival bands like Royal Crown Revue, they were not largely associated with the scene or subculture; when fans regularly began approaching the band&#x27;s merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing songs, the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band&#x27;s manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until they could afford to make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot: The Swingin&#x27; Hits of the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies&quot;, became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.

While stopped in Los Angeles during another tour together, Reel Big Fish arranged a meeting between their label Mojo Records and the Daddies in the hopes of helping the band obtain a distribution deal for &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;. Following negotiations between Perry and Mojo, however, the label instead signed the Daddies to a two-album recording contract. &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; was licensed and reissued by Mojo and given national distribution in July 1997, less than four months after its original release.

====Mainstream breakthrough====
As swing music steadily gained commercial momentum throughout 1997, sales of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; increased dramatically; by December, Mojo was moving 12,000 units per week. In January 1998, the label informed the Daddies of their decision to push the album&#x27;s title track as a major single and distribute it among mainstream radio stations. The Daddies, who were beginning work on their next studio album, ardently protested this move, believing that a swing song would never receive airplay and were concerned that the band would end up having to recoup the marketing costs. Mojo nevertheless persisted, and much to the band&#x27;s surprise, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; soon found regular rotation on stations such as Los Angeles&#x27; influential KROQ-FM, helping establish swing music in the mainstream and leading to its eventual commercial breakthrough, with the Daddies at the forefront. By mid-1998, the Daddies had emerged as one of the most successful bands of the swing revival: after climbing to number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; became the first album of the swing revival to crack the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 17 and spending an ultimate total of 53 weeks on the charts. In June 1998, the album had sold 500,000 copies in the United States, going on to surpass sales of 1.4 million by August.

Suddenly finding themselves in hot demand, the Daddies immediately started touring again. Spending the majority of 1998 and 1999 on the road, the band were now playing close to 300 shows a year, carrying out both headlining and supporting tours of the United States while traveling internationally as one of the headliners on the 1998 Warped Tour beside Rancid, NOFX and Bad Religion. By this time, the group&#x27;s touring conditions had greatly improved, thus enticing Dan Schmid – who had originally left the band due to health concerns – to return as the Daddies&#x27; bassist at Perry&#x27;s request.

Although the Daddies were experiencing commercial success under the guise of swing revivalists, having been declared the &quot;leaders&quot; of the movement by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality: Perry explained to &quot;Spin&quot; in July 1998, &quot;it&#x27;s not our mission to be a swing band. I&#x27;m not a guy from the &#x27;40s. That&#x27;s why we play ska and use heavy guitars&quot;, noting elsewhere &quot;I can&#x27;t fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we&#x27;re contemporary music&quot;. Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, &quot;I know there are people who come to our shows who&#x27;d like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7 ... there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We&#x27;re trying to find the audience who&#x27;ll let us write songs and just be who we are&quot;.

During the height of the Daddies&#x27; popularity, Perry found the band&#x27;s mainstream notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, &quot;It&#x27;s a total cliché, but [fame] doesn&#x27;t make you happy. There&#x27;s a lot missing. Success has given people the right to yell at me on the street, but I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s given me any dignity&quot;. Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies&#x27; constant touring, Perry&#x27;s frustration was only exacerbated by the media&#x27;s persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place in the swing scene, Perry retorted &quot;[we&#x27;ll] unapologetically play ska right in the face of people who want to hear swing&quot;.

&quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; had sold over two million copies in the United States by the time the swing revival&#x27;s mainstream popularity had declined, finally slipping off the charts in January 2000. With their touring schedule finally coming to a close, the Daddies commenced work on their next studio album.

===&quot;Soul Caddy&quot; and mainstream decline (2000)===
In the fall of 1999, the Daddies returned to the studio to record their fourth album, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;. A loose concept album reflecting Perry&#x27;s disillusionment over the cultural zeitgeist and his experience with fame - as he described it, a &quot;bittersweet&quot; record about &quot;being alienated and hoping to connect&quot; - &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; marked a continuation of the band&#x27;s musically varied format, intended to introduce a truer perspective of the Daddies&#x27; sound and personality to both their swing-based fans and a wider audience. Drawing from the rock and pop of the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; interwove swing and ska with glam rock, soul, psychedelic pop, folk and funk.

Despite allowing the Daddies creative control over its production, Mojo&#x27;s response to &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; was considered tepid at best. Claiming that the new material was not like &quot;the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies people know and love&quot;, the label did little to promote neither the album nor its glam-styled single &quot;Diamond Light Boogie&quot;, at one point releasing the latter without the band&#x27;s name on it, allegedly due to hesitancy over marketing a rock single from a band primarily known for swing music. With virtually no publicity behind it, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; was quietly released in October 2000. Met by a public largely unaware of the Daddies&#x27; eclectic background, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; was received negatively by both fans and critics, one of the more prevalent criticisms being its lack of swing tracks. Some reviewers chastised the band for what was being seen as an abandonment of their swing &quot;roots&quot; in favor of a trendier sound, while a few criticized the Daddies&#x27; entire musical aesthetic — UGO&#x27;s &quot;Hip Online&quot; stated bluntly, &quot;covering five or six genres on one album is just insane&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; placed &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; on their list of the 10 worst albums of 2000, the reviewer wondering what made a swing band &quot;think it could get away with an album of recycled psychedelic pop&quot;.

Despite some moderate critical praise including a glowing review from AllMusic, who called the album&#x27;s &quot;impressively surprising&quot; array of sounds &quot;refreshing coming from a band who was assumed to be generic retro swing&quot;, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies&#x27; accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance while audiences reacted unfavorably towards the band&#x27;s decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled &quot;we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;...we felt this tension to be something we weren&#x27;t&quot;. Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour&#x27;s outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. &quot;A lot of it was just fatigue&quot;, Perry explained, &quot;We&#x27;d be on the road for a long time and we had no life outside of Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies. I think everybody was interested in doing other things&quot;. The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though guitarist Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked &quot;to the curb&quot; after &quot;Soul Caddy&quot;″s poor commercial performance.

===Hiatus and limited touring (2001–2006)===

With nearly a decade of full-time band activity come to a rest, the Daddies parted ways to pursue other musical endeavors, remaining active in various local bands. Most notably, Perry and Moss started the theatrical glam punk group White Hot Odyssey, releasing an album on Jive Records in 2004 before disbanding the following year, while Schmid and keyboardist Dustin Lanker formed the piano rock trio The Visible Men, recording two studio albums and touring extensively until their own disbandment in 2007. Around this time, Schmid also toured as bassist for Pixies frontman Black Francis″ band, recording on his 2007 album &quot;Bluefinger&quot; as well as recording on Pete Yorn″s Francis-produced self-titled album in 2010. Lanker later joined California ska punk band the Mad Caddies as a touring member, eventually becoming a permanent member in 2013. Drummer Tim Donahue, after a stint with The Visible Men, worked as a session musician, recording on albums for artists including TobyMac and Shawn McDonald and playing in Yngwie Malmsteen″s band for his 2001 European tour.

Over the next few years, all Daddies activity was put on further hold as the members returned to their family lives and full-time jobs, while Perry chose to resume his education at the University of Oregon, graduating in 2004 with a B.S. in molecular biology. In February 2002, after over a year without playing, the Daddies ended their hiatus by headlining at The Festival at Sandpoint in Sandpoint, Idaho, which was followed by a series of sporadic appearances at various music festivals throughout the Northwest. Despite the sudden resurgence of activity, the band resolutely announced no future plans for recording new material or undertaking any extensive tours. Favoring a change of pace from their formerly intensive touring habits, the Daddies began scheduling their performances entirely around the band members&#x27; desire and personal availability, playing as few as eight to ten shows a year and limiting their appearances largely to Northwest shows or commissions for one-off &quot;swingin&#x27; hits&quot; concerts at various festivals and venues across the United States.

===&quot;Susquehanna&quot; and return to independent label (2006–2009)===
Following four years of relative inactivity as the band maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing material for a new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to have come to the realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation to record a new studio album, noting that the music would cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical elements. Throughout the fall of 2006, the band carried out several small tours throughout the United States, where much of this new material was debuted.

Self-produced and recorded in Eugene during the summer of 2007, the Daddies&#x27; fifth album, &quot;Susquehanna&quot;, was released via digital download exclusively through the band&#x27;s website in February 2008, receiving a limited CD release several months later. Taking the shape of a narrative concept album which Perry detailed as a portrait of &quot;various relationships in decay&quot;, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; featured prominent strains of Latin and Caribbean-influenced music, incorporating flourishes of flamenco, Latin rock and reggae into the band&#x27;s traditional fare of swing and ska. While its low-profile DIY release went mostly unnoticed by the mainstream media, response from internet-based publications ranged from mixed to positive, with reviewers once again polarized over the album&#x27;s eclectic blend of genres. The Daddies embarked on another full-length tour in support of &quot;Susquehanna&quot; in mid-2008, followed by a headline tour of Europe, their first visit to the continent since 1998.

In July 2009, the Daddies announced having signed to independent label Rock Ridge Music for the release and national distribution of two albums, a re-issue of &quot;Susquehanna&quot; and &quot;Skaboy JFK: The Skankin&#x27; Hits of the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies&quot;, a compilation of the band&#x27;s ska material culled from their first five albums. Perry explained that fans had been suggesting the concept of a ska collection for years, and that such an album might help show a different side of the Daddies than the &quot;swing band&quot; persona they&#x27;re generally recognized for. &quot;Skaboy JFK&quot; was released in September 2009 to a largely positive critical reception, followed by further touring into 2010, taking the Daddies back across Europe and the United States, as well as appearing alongside Fishbone and The Black Seeds at the 11th Victoria Ska Fest in British Columbia, where the band played the first all-ska set of their career.

===&quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot; (2010–2013)===
Shortly after the release of &quot;Skaboy JFK&quot;, Perry already began announcing plans for the Daddies&#x27; next studio album, revealing the band would be returning to swing music for their first all-swing album since &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;. Initial production on the album, titled &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot;, began in March 2011, though lasted infrequently throughout the year as the Daddies continued to carry out several more successful international tours, including two separate sold-out tours of Australia in 2011 and 2012. During this time, the band experienced major changes within their touring lineup after longtime keyboardist Dustin Lanker departed the group in 2012, prompting the Daddies to decide to continue touring without a live keyboardist. Several months later, trombonist Joe Freuen was added to the band, marking the first time the Daddies had ever included a full-time trombone player in their official lineup.

In mid-2012, Perry finally elaborated on the production status of the new album, revealing that the band had written enough material to release &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot; as a double album, consisting of the main all-swing album and a bonus disc of &quot;Americana&quot;-influenced rock songs in styles including rockabilly, country, bluegrass and western swing, the latter disc featuring guest appearances from accordionist Buckwheat Zydeco on a zydeco song and former Captain Beefheart guitarist Zoot Horn Rollo on a psychobilly track. On June 20, 2012, the Daddies launched a PledgeMusic campaign to help finance the final stages of the album&#x27;s production, successfully reaching its target on August 14 and continuing to collect pledges into the following year, ultimately raising 133% of its goal.

Preceded by the release of two singles and music videos for the songs &quot;I Love American Music&quot; and &quot;The Babooch&quot;, &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot; was released independently on Space Age Bachelor Pad Records on July 16, 2013. Following the low-key DIY release and promotion of &quot;Susquehanna&quot; and &quot;Skaboy JFK&quot;, the Daddies worked to heavily publicize &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot;, receiving coverage by major news outlets including &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;, while the band later appeared on the Fox-owned KTTV program &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot; to perform &quot;I Love American Music&quot;, their first major television appearance since the 1990s. Despite not experiencing any chart success, the album received generally positive critical reviews, and the Daddies carried out a brief fifteen-city tour of the United States during the summer.

In January 2014, it was announced that the Eugene Ballet had collaborated with the Daddies for production entitled &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, a dance show set to the music of and featuring live accompaniment from the band, featuring choreographed dance routines set to thirteen of the Daddies&#x27; songs, ranging from their biggest swing hits to their lesser-known rock, pop and psychedelic songs. &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; played at Eugene&#x27;s Hult Center for the Performing Arts on April 12 and 13, 2014.

===Cover albums and &quot;Zoot Suit Riot: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2014–2018)===
During the initial writing and recording period of &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot;, the Daddies began playing select shows billed as &quot;The Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies Salute the Music of the Rat Pack&quot;, playing an equal mix of the band&#x27;s own swing songs as well as covers of songs popularized by the &quot;Rat Pack&quot; of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. In a July 2013 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Perry revealed that the band had concurrently recorded a tribute album featuring these songs and would be releasing it after touring behind &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot;. &quot;Please Return the Evening — the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies Salute the Music of the Rat Pack!&quot; was released on July 29, 2014, promoted by music videos for the album&#x27;s covers of the Sinatra staples &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; and &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;.

The following December, Perry expressed plans on the Daddies&#x27; official Facebook page to further explore the band&#x27;s swing and jazz influences with another cover album, this time centered on the hot jazz of the Cotton Club era of the 1920s and 1930s. Production on what would eventually be entitled &quot;The Boop-A-Doo&quot; began in Spring 2015 in Eugene, utilizing vintage recording techniques as well as the use of pre-1940s instruments to achieve an authentic jazz-era sound. &quot;The Boop-A-Doo&quot; was released on January 22, 2016, promoted by a music video for the 1930 Eubie Blake/Andy Razaf song &quot;That Lindy Hop&quot;, directed by Perry.

Initially, the Daddies announced that &quot;Please Return the Evening&quot; and &quot;The Boop-A-Doo&quot; would comprise two parts of a planned trilogy of cover albums designed to showcase the band&#x27;s swing and jazz influences. Although Perry revealed in a November 2016 interview that the Daddies&#x27; third volume of cover songs would focus on either western swing or a Babs Gonzales/&quot;beatnik&quot;-style bebop, as of March 2019, there have been no further updates on the status of this album.

During this period, Perry was also occupied with the task of remixing and remastering the Daddies&#x27; &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; compilation, having re-obtained the rights from Jive Records in 2014. Speaking on the project, he lamented that production of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; had been rushed and that only first takes had been used, noting that there could have been &quot;2 or 3 more&quot; takes of the songs &quot;if we had known the future back in 1996&quot;, noting &quot;after 25 years [of the band], I would like to make the record sound a little better&quot;. &quot;Zoot Suit Riot: The 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released on CD and vinyl on January 13, 2017, featuring five bonus live tracks recorded during the band&#x27;s 1998 tours. In promotion of the album&#x27;s re-release, the Daddies played select dates throughout the country, performing the album in its entirety.

===&quot;Bigger Life&quot; (2019–present)===
While the Daddies dedicated most of the 2010s to playing and recording swing and jazz music, Perry first revealed in a 2014 interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; that he had started writing new non-swing songs for the next original Daddies album, describing his ambitions of making a &quot;psychobilly/Zappa/&quot;American Idiot&quot;/R. Crumb type record that paints a picture of the American socio political scene&quot;, emphasizing his desire to experiment with rockabilly and roots rock. Over the next four years, Perry gave sporadic updates on Twitter and in interviews on the development of this new album of originals, describing it in 2016 as &quot;a little like &quot;Ferociously Stoned 2&quot;&quot;, featuring a primary emphasis on rock and funk, and then later in 2017 as &quot;swing-ska-rockabilly-psychobilly&quot;. Production on the album began in late 2017, and on May 8, 2018, Perry announced on Twitter that the mixing process had begun on the finished product, now titled &quot;Bigger Life&quot;.

On March 12, 2019, the Daddies premiered the first single and music video from &quot;Bigger Life&quot; on their YouTube channel, a ska punk song entitled &quot;Gym Rat&quot;, later followed by two additional singles and music videos for the songs &quot;Diesel PunX&quot;, a rockabilly-styled song influenced by the science fiction sub-genre of dieselpunk, and the Celtic punk/folk punk-influenced &quot;Yankee Pride&quot;. &quot;Bigger Life&quot; was released on CD and vinyl on June 14, which was celebrated with a show at Eugene&#x27;s W.O.W. Hall the same day, where the Daddies debuted a new stage show focusing exclusively on the band&#x27;s repertoire of ska and ska-punk songs, a set they continued to perform at select shows and festivals, including the 2019 Victoria Ska Fest. The Daddies had been scheduled to perform as part of the Supernova International Ska Festival located in Virginia in June 2020, though the festival was ultimately canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On January 31, 2020, the Daddies released the standalone single &quot;Faux Nice, Mock Fancy&quot;, a glam rock-styled song recorded during the &quot;Bigger Life&quot; sessions. In a Facebook post announcing the single, Perry detailed that he planned to release various unreleased songs as singles throughout the year as he started work on new material. This started with the single and video release of &quot;Platform Shoes&quot;, another glam rock-styled song from the deluxe edition of &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot;, in mid-March and a cover of Canadian rock band The Kings″ 1980 hit &quot;Switchin&#x27; to Glide&quot; in mid-May.

In an October 2022 interview, Perry revealed that he had spent much of the pandemic writing three albums worth of original material, including an all-swing album, a ska-pop-funk album and a psychobilly album.

On July 13, 2023, the Daddies premiered the first single from an upcoming untitled album, &quot;Lowdown Appreciator&quot;. On November 30, the band premiered another new single, &quot;Kings of Swing&quot;, which was accompanied by the unveiling of the new album&#x27;s title - &quot;At the Pink Rat&quot;, its album art and a projected release date of July 26, 2024.

==Musical style and lyricism==
The Daddies are generally classified as a swing and/or ska band by the media, and their music is largely composed of various interpretations of both genres, ranging from traditional jazz and big band-influenced forms to modernized rock and punk fusions. During their commercial breakthrough in the 1990s, critics conceived terms such as &quot;punk swing&quot;, &quot;power swing&quot; and &quot;big band punk rock&quot; to describe the Daddies&#x27; unique approach to these fusions, mixing &quot;the propulsion of swing beats and rabbit-punch bursts of brass with grimy rebel-rock guitars to give the jumpin&#x27; jive sound a much-needed facelift&quot;. &quot;The Pacific Northwest Inlander&quot; wrote of this style in 1994, &quot;atop the swing of the band&#x27;s jazz you can hear strains of Parliament-Funkadelic, crumbs of barrelhouse rhythm and blues, snippets of ska, and huge whiffs of in-your-face punk rock&quot;, likening the Daddies to &quot;Cab Calloway-meets-Johnny Rotten, or the Duke Ellington Orchestra pumped up on steroids and caffeine&quot;.

The Daddies themselves used to facetiously classify their music as &quot;swing-core&quot;, exemplified by the fast tempos and frequent use of guitar distortion in their swing material, as well as &quot;third wave swing&quot;, owing to their prominent ska influence. In recent years, however, Perry has dismissed attempts to apply labels to the Daddies&#x27; music, often casually describing them in vaguer terms as &quot;a rock band with horns&quot; or &quot;a dance band that uses jazz a bit&quot;. Perry has compared the Daddies&#x27; style of musical eclecticism with that of Fishbone, Mink DeVille and Oingo Boingo, while also citing major influence from The Specials and Roxy Music, as well as from Fletcher Henderson, Jimmie Lunceford and Duke Ellington on his composing and arrangements.

Alongside the constants of swing, ska, and on earlier recordings, funk, each of the Daddies&#x27; studio albums feature a collective assortment of varied and often diametrically opposed genres of music. Some of the musical styles the band has experimented with include blues, country, disco, Dixieland, flamenco, folk, glam rock, hardcore punk, jump blues, lounge, psychedelic pop, rhythm and blues, reggae, rockabilly, soca, soul, western swing and zydeco. As opposed to playing fusions, the Daddies perform each genre separately, contrasting one style against another so that the album&#x27;s musical texture continually changes. Perry has explained that the group&#x27;s &quot;&quot; of using vastly different genres is both a means for band experimentation and evolution beyond their typically swing and ska-oriented live shows, as well as an artistic choice, lending each song a distinctive musical personality and using certain genres to effectively fit – or ironically contradict – the tone of the lyrics.

===Lyrical===

Steve Perry is the Daddies&#x27; sole lyricist, and writes the majority of his songs in a fictional narrative format he credits as being influenced by Randy Newman, Ray Davies and Jarvis Cocker, often told about or through the unreliable perspective of downtrodden characters struggling against adversity. Recurring themes in the Daddies&#x27; lyrics include sex, death, working class life, class consciousness, alcoholism, family dysfunction, loneliness and social alienation, frequently utilizing humor and satire. Perry often incorporates commentary on contemporary American politics into his music, such as addressing issues relating to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on 2013&#x27;s &quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot; and exploring themes of race and class during the Donald Trump administration on 2019&#x27;s &quot;Bigger Life&quot;. &quot;The Register-Guard&quot; has described Perry&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;ribald [and] often despairing&quot;, &quot;[probing] the underbelly of society, stabbing at oppressors such as ... the pressure to conform&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; has lauded them as &quot;vivid poetry&quot; containing &quot;an inventiveness missing from most of the other swing bands&#x27; lyrics&quot;.

The Daddies have often been criticized for their seeming juxtaposition of lurid subject matter and profanity with jazz and swing music, though Perry has defended the band&#x27;s predilection towards &quot;darker&quot; lyricism and visuals, calling to attention his interest in the era&#x27;s film noir and avant-garde artistic movements. A prominent example of this includes the two music videos for the Daddies&#x27; hit single &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, which – in addition to being written about the 1943 race riots – both featured pervasive surrealist imagery inspired by the films of Luis Buñuel, specifically his 1929 short &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;. &quot;We wanted to be darker, weirder and stranger&quot;, Perry stated in a 2012 interview, &quot;and unfortunately, with other [swing] bands it was &#x27;Back then everyone dressed nice and was nice&#x27;. That&#x27;s not true. You don&#x27;t know anything about that era at all&quot;.

Most of the Daddies&#x27; studio albums are written to varying extents as concept albums, featuring either recurring lyrical themes or an abstract narrative. According to Perry, this lyrical interconnectedness is intended as means of providing an album with threads of thematic stability against wildly varying musical styles.

==Reception, criticism and influence==
In their native Oregon, the Daddies have been called &quot;a Northwest institution&quot;, having been inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in 2009. &quot;The Register-Guard&quot; has credited the band with shaping Eugene&#x27;s alternative musical culture in the 1990s, while &quot;Eugene Weekly&quot; added likewise, &quot;when some people think of the Northwest music scene, they think of grunge. If you&#x27;re a Eugenean, however, you might think of swing, thanks to [the] Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies&quot;. Seattle&#x27;s &quot;The Rocket&quot; commented on the band&#x27;s influence in 1997, stating &quot;[t]he Daddies were busting out the swing before the Squirrel Nut Zippers, stirring cocktails before Combustible Edison and skating the ska before Sublime ... the band shakes out an incredible variety of sounds with peerless verve and polish.&quot;

Together with the controversies surrounding the early years of their career, the band have also attracted a fair amount of professional criticism in their home state. &quot;The Portland Mercury&quot; have been frequent detractors of the Daddies, deriding them as &quot;at best, an edgeless recycle of a rather particular musical fashion movement; at worst, a self-conscious parody of the genre they purport to love&quot;, while the &quot;Willamette Week&quot;, in an article detailing the band&#x27;s polarizing reception, described the negative consensus of the Daddies as &quot;an annoying white-boy funk rock band who, seeing the opportunity, milked the swing revival for all it was worth&quot;. Jazz critic and author Scott Yanow vociferously criticized the band as the choice &quot;whipping boy for the Retro Swing movement&quot; in his 2000 book &quot;Swing!&quot;, writing them off as &quot;a punk rock band who has chosen to masquerade as Swing, at least until a better fad comes along&quot;, spotlighting the Daddies&#x27; &quot;mediocre&quot; rhythm section and profane lyricism as a case for making them &quot;a band to avoid&quot;.

The Daddies are more widely recognized, however, as one of the first bands to revive swing music in the musical mainstream, helping spearhead the swing revival of the late 1990s which paved the way for the larger successes of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Although the Daddies have been cited as an influence on ska punk bands the Mad Caddies and Spring Heeled Jack U.S., &quot;SF Weekly&quot; once claimed the group has &quot;never gotten the accolades it deserves&quot; for their eclectic funk-ska repertoire. The &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; expressed similar sentiments, listing the &quot;woefully unsung&quot; Daddies as among the bands that defined the Northwest&#x27;s &quot;alternative to alternative&quot;, &quot;[delivering] rock with more complexity than three-chord guitar riffs and social critique without heavy-handed cynicism&quot;. In a 2008 retrospective feature posted on RollingStone.com″s The Capri Lounge, a blog run by the editors of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, the Daddies were declared as &quot;one of the most misunderstood bands of the nineties&quot;.

===Band name===
The Daddies have also retained a more ignominious recognition for their off-color band name which has persisted beyond the initial controversies which pegged the band&#x27;s early years. The Daddies frequently appear on lists of the worst band names of all time, including those by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, and VH1, the last of which called it &quot;quite possibly the most offensive band name ever, made all the more ridiculous by the fact that these outwardly bragging virgin-sexers had a completely innocuous mainstream hit song&quot;. A 2009 issue of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine placed the Daddies in third place in a bracket chart of the worst band names, while in 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the Daddies on their list of &quot;The Thirteen Dumbest Band Names in Rock History&quot;, noting that the incestuous interpretation of the name is &quot;the last thing anyone wants to visualize while listening to music&quot;.

Steve Perry has expressed ambivalence about the name&#x27;s controversy, conceding it&#x27;s &quot;probably the most heinous name in the history of rock&quot; though also trying to contextualize it within the band&#x27;s roots in the 1980s Northwest punk rock scene: in a 2020 interview, he explained &quot;it&#x27;s a lot harder to understand the name now that the counter-cultural mentality has faded, but in that time, the idea was you wanted to choose a band name that would attract other punk rock kids and keep others at bay&quot;. In a 2000 interview, he further detailed the contrast between the Daddies&#x27; name and their unexpected breakthrough into the wider cultural mainstream, saying &quot;Pop culture is trying to offend no one. We didn&#x27;t come out of that; we came from the loyal opposition. We came out of the punk movement. How can I deny that? I started this band a long time ago, and we just used [the name]. We didn&#x27;t know that in 10 years we&#x27;d turn into some sort of happy, peppy, feel-good things.&quot;

Although Perry has occasionally voiced regret over not having changed the Daddies&#x27; name early in their career, he has more recently come to embrace the controversy around the name as his &quot;Holden Caulfield red hunting hat - a badge of honor&quot;, dismissing critics who choose to demonize the name based on literal interpretation than the jazz-era jive slang it drew from as &quot;outrage addicts&quot;.

<text>The [[MAN Truck &amp; Bus|MAN]] 24.3x0 HOCLNR-NL was a series of low-floor 3-axle double-decker bus chassis built for right-hand drive markets, as indicated by the R in the designation. It was designed by MAN Truck &amp; Bus, a subsidiary of Triton based on Munich. Unlike other low-entry double-decker buses in Hong Kong, there are steps in the lower deck aisle after the rear exit.

The 24.3x0 was available as both the 24.310 and 24.350, with internal codes &quot;MAN A59&quot; and &quot;MAN A57&quot; respectively. For the type designation 24.310, 24 means that the bus has the maximum gross weight of , whilst 310 means that the maximum power of the engine is ; for 24.350, the 350 means that the maximum power of the engine is .

==Hong Kong==

===Citybus===
In December 1997, Citybus introduced a solitary Australian-built MAN 24.350 bus with Volgren CR221LD bodywork. This bus remained unique in Citybus fleet and was withdrawn in 2015 due to engine failure and lack of spare parts.

====Cancelled order====
In 1998, Citybus ordered a number of MAN 24.310 buses with Berkhof/Volgren CR223LD bodywork after the trial of its MAN 24.350. However, in early 1999, Transport Department of Hong Kong set quota on the number of buses owned by Citybus, and therefore the order was cancelled involuntarily.

At that time, construction of 32 Berkhof-bodied buses and 2 Volgren CR223LD-bodied buses had been completed, so MAN had to find buyers for these buses. Finally, one Berkhof-bodied bus was retained by MAN for testing, and the others were sold for operations in Hong Kong.

===Kwoon Chung Motors===
In 1999, Kwoon Chung Motors, a coach and rental bus operator in Hong Kong, took one of the Berkhof-bodied MAN 24.310 that had been built for Citybus and the bus entered service in 2000.

The bus was primarily used on worker services (for staff working at some of the companies at the Hong Kong International Airport). But during rush hours, it could be seen allocated to New Lantao Bus, (a subsidiary of Kwoon Chung), routes in Tung Chung.

This bus was retired and stored in July 2015.

===Kowloon Motor Bus===
Kowloon Motor Bus took delivery of the other 32 MAN 24.310 buses from the Citybus order. The 30 buses with Berkhof bodywork entered service in 2000. The 2 buses with Volgren CR223LD bodywork, which had been stored in Volgren&#x27;s facility at Perth, Australia, entered service in 2002.

Later, KMB ordered 15 MAN 24.310 buses with Volgren CR223LD bodywork. They had the staircase moved forward, had yellow instead of red handrails and no seats were fitted above the front wheels. They entered service in 2002.

All of these 47 buses were allocated to Tuen Mun Depot and mainly ran on express routes serving Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan, Kwai Tsing Districts and Kowloon.

The buses have reached 16 to 18 years of age in 2018, KMB has withdrawn all of the buses from service.

==United Kingdom==
Stagecoach Group introduced 28 MAN 24.350 intercity coaches with Jonckheere Monaco bodywork in 1999/2000 for its Oxford Tube service. They were superseded by new Neoplan Skyliner intercity coaches in 2004.

<doc id="1056809" wikidata="Q6569323" url="?curid=1056809" title="Yoshito Matsushige">
<text>was a Japanese photojournalist who survived the dropping of the atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and took five photographs on the day of the bombing in Hiroshima, the only photographs taken that day within Hiroshima that are known.
Matsushige was born in Kure, Hiroshima in 1913. He took a job at a newspaper after finishing school and in 1943 entered the photography section of the newspaper &quot;Chugoku Shimbun&quot;.
Matsushige was at home 2.7 km south of the hypocentre at the time of the explosion. He was not seriously injured, and determined to go to the city centre. A fire forced him back to Miyuki bridge, where the scene of desperate and dying people prevented him from using his camera for twenty minutes, when he took two frames at about 11:00. He tried again later that day but was too nauseated to take more than three more frames. The first two frames are of people who escaped serious injury next to Miyuki bridge; the second of these is taken closer up and shows them having cooking oil applied to their burns. A third shows a policeman, his head bandaged, issuing certificates to civilians. The last pair are taken close to home: one of the damage to his family&#x27;s barbershop, and another out of his window.

Matsushige was unable to develop the film for twenty days, and even then had to do so at night and in the open, rinsing it in a stream. The negatives had severely deteriorated by the 1970s, requiring intensive restoration work.

<text>Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed (, ‎; 15 December 1934 – 23 March 2012) was a Somali politician and former military officer. He was one of the founders of the rebel Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), as well as the Puntland state of Somalia, the latter of which he served as the first president. In 2004, Yusuf also helped establish the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), which he led as President of Somalia from 2004 until 2008.

Yusuf was a career soldier in the Somali National Army, participating in the 1964 Border War and Ogaden War against Ethiopia. After Somalia&#x27;s defeat in the Ogaden War in 1978, he led a failed coup against President Siad Barre, marking the start of the Somali rebellion. Following the coup&#x27;s failure, Yusuf established the Somali Salvation Democratic Front in Ethiopia and began fighting alongside Ethiopian forces against the Somali army. During the 1982 Ethiopian-Somali War, he led SSDF forces. Frustrated by the operation&#x27;s failure and the SSDF&#x27;s surrender to the Somali government, the Ethiopians jailed Yusuf until the Derg regime collapsed in 1991.

After his release, Yusuf returned to his home region and helped establish the Puntland government in 1998. He later joined an Ethiopian-backed coalition of warlords opposing the Somali Transitional National Government (TNG) formed in 2000. During the Puntland crisis (2001–2003) he had a violent power struggle against Jama Ali Jama over regional leadership. Yusuf attempted to extend his term after it expired, sparking a political crisis and the election of a new Puntland president, which Yusuf rejected. In May 2002, with Ethiopian military assistance, Yusuf ousted Jama after accusing him of ties to terrorism. During the conflict he was responsible for ordering the assassinations of civic leaders in Puntland such as Sultan Hurre.

In 2004, Yusuf became president of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG). He received Ethiopia&#x27;s backing and approval, in exchange for dropping Somalia&#x27;s long-standing claim to the Ogaden region. Despite widespread opposition within the TFG and without cabinet or parliamentary approval, Yusuf controversially requested Ethiopian troops to support his administration against the Islamic Courts Union during 2006. By the end of the Ethiopian military occupation in December 2008, much of the country had fallen to the insurgency and Yusuf was threatened with international sanctions over his refusal to support national reconciliation. The TFG parliament moved to impeach Yusuf after accusing him of being a dictator. On 24 December 2008, he resigned from the presidency, leading to the dissolution of his government. After he resigned he was given political asylum in Yemen.

Yusuf died in the United Arab Emirates on 23 March 2012.

==Early life ==
Abdullahi Yusuf was born on 15 December 1934 in Galkayo, situated in the north-central Mudug region of Somalia. The city was at the time part of Italian Somaliland. His family hailed from the Omar Mahmoud sub clan of the larger Majeerteen Harti Darod clan.

For his post-secondary education, Ahmed studied law at the Somali National University in Mogadishu. He later moved abroad to pursue Military Studies.

Ahmed was married to Hawa Abdi Samatar. The couple had two sons and two daughters in addition to six grandchildren.

==Military career ==
Ahmed joined the colonial forces of the Trust Territory of Somaliland in 1950. In 1954, he was included in the first batch of Somali military personnel that was taken to Italy for Officer training. The batch included Aidid, Samatar, and Gabeyre. He was promoted to the post of commander in 1960. As a soldier, he participated in the 1964 war against the Ethiopia and was decorated for his actions of valor during the war.

Ahmed obtained a degree in Military Topography from the M. V. Frunze Military Academy in the former Soviet Union (Военная академия им. М. В. Фрунзе), an elite institution reserved for the most qualified officers of the Warsaw Pact armies and their allies. He received additional military training in Italy.

Between 1965 and 1968, he served as Somalia&#x27;s military attaché to Moscow. On 15 October 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of Las Anod, Somalia&#x27;s then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d&#x27;état on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition – essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army. For refusing to support Barre&#x27;s seizure of power, Ahmed was imprisoned for several years by the new military regime.

In 1975, Ahmed was released from prison and appointed by Barre as the director of a governmental agency. He later commanded the Somali National Army&#x27;s (SNA) southern front in the Ogaden War against neighboring Ethiopia, with assistance from 60th division commandant Col. Abdullahi Ahmed Irro, as well as frontline deputies Col. Abdulkadir Berked of Begedi of Afgio and Col. Ahmed Ilgir of Burtinle serving as his deputies. Ahmed was assigned to lead the Negheille offensive in 1977, which extended from Bali in the southwest to the town of Negheille. For his efforts, Ahmed was again decorated for courage, but would remain a Colonel throughout his military career.

==Somali Salvation Democratic Front ==

In 1978, together with a group of officials mainly from his own Majeerteen (Darod) clan, Ahmed participated in an abortive attempt to overthrow Barre&#x27;s dictatorial administration. The military coup d&#x27;état was originally planned for 12 April. However, it was instead hastily carried out a few days earlier, on 9 April, due to fears of potential leaks. Ahmed was at the time in the southern Gedo region and was unaware of the changes to the coup plan. He later learned of the failed putsch via a secured communication network, which contained a coded two sentence message from Col. Abdullahi Ahmed Irro reading &quot;Wife Aborted&quot;, dated 11:00 am, 9 April 1978. Most of the people who had helped plot the coup were summarily executed, but Ahmed and several other colonels managed to escape abroad.

Later that year, in adjacent Ethiopia, Ahmed and Hassan Ali Mire formed a rebel movement called the Somali Salvation Front, with Ahmed serving as chairman. The organization was subsequently renamed the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) in 1979. It was the first of several opposition groups dedicated to ousting Barre&#x27;s regime by force.

After opposing the Ethiopian government&#x27;s claims of sovereignty over several Somali-inhabited areas that the SSDF had managed to seize control of from Barre&#x27;s forces, Ahmed was detained by the local Ethiopian authorities in 1985. Mire was elected as the SSDF&#x27;s new chairman the following year. Ahmed would remain imprisoned until his release in 1990, following the demise of Ethiopia&#x27;s then-ruling Derg.

Ahmed subsequently returned to Somalia. In 1992, he marshalled forces to successfully expel an Islamist extremist group linked to Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya that had taken over Bosaso, a prominent port city and the commercial capital of the northeastern part of the country. He later served as a co-chairman of the National Salvation Council of Somalia, established in 1997.

==President of Puntland==
Abdullahi Yusuf led Somalia&#x27;s autonomous Puntland region from 1998-2004. The region was largely peaceful under Yusuf&#x27;s rule except from mid-2001 to mid-2002, when he was deposed over widespread objections to his attempt to lengthen his term of office.

In 2000, Yusuf opposed the first attempt to restore a central state when the Transitional National Government (TNG) was created that year at a conference of elders. Due to opposition from the country&#x27;s many warlords, including Yusuf, the TNG&#x27;s authority withered within months. He was a member of an Ethiopian-backed coalition of warlords that succeeded in undermining the TNG.

In 2001 the Puntland crisis began as Abdullahi Yusuf&#x27;s term as Puntland president came to a close. In August 2001, a general congress representing all major clans in Puntland elected Abdullahi Yusuf&#x27;s political rival, Jama Ali Jama, as the new president. Jama&#x27;s close ties to the Mogadishu-based Transitional National Government alarmed Ethiopia, which opposed the TNG and was determined to remove it. Yusuf refused to accept the election results, leading to violent clashes with Jama in Garowe. By December 2001, Ethiopian troops intervened in support of Yusuf. Yusuf had used the &#x27;War on Terror&#x27; to justify the operation and claimed Jama supported Al-Itihaad Al-Islamiya. In January 2002, Ethiopia intervened again, accusing Jama of harboring members of Al-Itihaad—a claim Jama denied. During May 2002, Yusuf defeated Jama and reasserted his control over Puntland. Fighting broke out against between forces loyal to Yusuf and Jama during January 2003.

During this period Abdullahi Yusuf&#x27;s forces were responsible for the assassination of civic leaders in Puntland, most notably Sultan Hurre during August 2002. Surre was a major opponent of Yusuf of extrajudicially executed by the security forces belonging to him. Yusuf&#x27;s government accused Hurre of &quot;association with extremist elements&quot; and targeted him for arrest. While they had claimed his death was accidental, a journalist who had witnessed Surre&#x27;s death described seeing a deliberate assassination.

== Transitional Federal Government ==
=== Establishment and overview ===

On 10 October 2004, in a session held by the Transitional Federal Parliamentin the neighbouring Kenyan capital of Nairobi, Ahmed was elected as President of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), an interim federal administrative body that he had helped establish earlier in the year. He received 189 votes from the TFG Parliament, while the closest contender being, former Somali Ambassador to the United States Abdullahi Ahmed Addou, got 79 votes in the third round of voting. The then incumbent President of Somalia, Abdiqasim Salad Hassan, peacefully withdrew his candidature. Ahmed was sworn in a few days later on 14 October 2004.

The Ethiopian government heavily backed the presidency of Abdullahi Yusuf and the formation of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004 on the grounds that Yusuf would give up Somalia&#x27;s long standing claim to the Ogaden. Before becoming president of the TFG during 2004, Abdullahi Yusuf was a member of an Ethiopian-backed coalition of warlords that had undermined a previous attempt at restoring a government in Somalia when the Transitional National Government (TNG) formed in 2000. I.M. Lewis observes that with significant Ethiopian support, Abdullahi Yusuf was elected as the TFG president, and, under Ethiopian direction, he appointed a prime minister with connections to then-Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. These close connections to Addis Ababa were a driving force behind the invasion and provoked the ICU into later adopting a bellicose stance. In 2004, Yusuf made his first foreign visit as President when he travelled to Ethiopia. During this visit he requested 20,000 Ethiopian troops to back his government.

As President, Ahmed pledged to promote reconciliation and to set about rebuilding the country. However, his government was beset by internal disagreements and contentions with other stakeholders in Somalia. For example, he was at loggerheads with some warlords and government members over where the administration should be based. The President and Prime Minister opposed a move to Mogadishu, citing security reasons. Consequently, Ahmed along with his Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Ghedi and the Speaker of the Parliament Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden helped to relocate the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) from Nairobi to the Somali cities of Jowhar and Baidoa, where the TFG resided until the government eventually took control of Mogadishu.

The majority of Somali society, including much of the newly formed Transitional Federal Government, deeply opposed any foreign military intervention on Somali soil. An African Union fact finding mission to Somalia in 2005 found that the overwhelming majority of Somalis rejected troops from neighboring states entering the country. Despite significant opposition within the TFG parliament, President Yusuf made the widely unpopular decision to invite Ethiopian troops to prop up his administration. As an institution, the TFG did not consent to or approve of the Ethiopian military intervention. No parliamentary approval was given for a decision openly opposed by a significant portion of the government.

Due to a lack of funding and human resources, an arms embargo that made it difficult to re-establish a national security force, and general indifference on the part of the international community, President Ahmed also found himself obliged to deploy thousands of troops from Puntland to Mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent elements in the southern part of the country. Financial support for this effort was provided by the autonomous region&#x27;s government. This left little revenue for Puntland&#x27;s own security forces and civil service employees, leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attacks.

=== Insurgency ===
In May 2006, the Second Battle of Mogadishu started and CNN reported that there were interim government forces in action. However, Ahmed told the BBC that the alliance of warlords were not fighting on behalf of the government, and threatened to fire them. Indeed, members of the government who were part of the warring Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (ARPCT) were sacked. Others left the government in disaffection following the victories of the Islamic Courts Union.

After the start of the new phase of the War in Somalia on 21 December 2006, the TFG, with the help of Ethiopian forces, wrested control of the southern part of the country and the capital, Mogadishu, from the hands of the Islamic Courts Union. By 28 December, the Transitional Federal Government had captured Mogadishu as the ICU forces fled. On 8 January 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni raged, TFG President Ahmed entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. It was announced that the government would relocate to Villa Somalia in the capital from its interim location in Baidoa. This marked the first time since in 1991 that a Somali government controlled most of the country.

During fierce fighting in Mogadishu in early 2007, the Ethiopian army reportedly carpet bombed neighborhoods. Yusuf announced in a radio interview that “any place from which a bullet is fired, we will bombard it, regardless of whoever is there.”

Due to a lack of funding and human resources, an arms embargo that made it difficult to re-establish a national security force, and general indifference on the part of the international community, President Ahmed also found himself obliged to deploy thousands of troops from Puntland to Mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent elements in the southern part of the country. Financial support for this effort was provided by the autonomous region&#x27;s government. This left little revenue for Puntland&#x27;s own security forces and civil service employees, leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attacks.

Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military&#x27;s presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to withdraw from the country, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government&#x27;s troops.

=== Assassination attempt ===
On 17 September 2006, a suicide car bomber smashed his vehicle into Ahmed&#x27;s convoy outside the National Parliament in Baidoa. The attack killed four of Ahmed&#x27;s bodyguards as well as Ahmed&#x27;s brother. Six attackers were also slain in the subsequent gun battle.

=== Health problems ===
Ahmed underwent a liver transplant in the 1990s. In early December 2007, he was admitted to a hospital in Nairobi for treatment of what his spokesman described as bronchitis, and on 4 January 2008, he collapsed in Baidoa and was taken to Ethiopia for treatment. Two days later, Ahmed was rushed to London for tests. He returned to Mogadishu on 16 February 2008; rebels promptly fired mortars at the presidential compound, reportedly wounding at least five people.

=== Dismissal of government ===
During June 2008, a faction of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia and the TFG signed a ceasefire agreement after months of talks in Djibouti. The agreement was met with resistance from elements within the TFG, chiefly President Yusuf. In the second half of 2008, Ahmed had been at loggerheads with then Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein over a proposed new cabinet, the latter of which Ahmed characterized as nothing more than a &quot;clan deal&quot;. By mid-2008, President Yusuf had lost all the support he had accumulated in the international community. His primary backer, Ethiopia, had also become tired of the TFG president only offering military answers to serious political issues. 
On 14 December 2008, Ahmed announced that he had dismissed Hussein and his government, citing corruption, inefficiency, treason and failure to bring peace to the war-torn country as reasons for the dismissal. Earlier in the year, Hussein had survived a vote of no confidence after having been accused by some lawmakers of embezzling state funds.

Hussein said that Ahmed did not have the power to fire him without parliamentary approval, while Ahmed asserted that he believed Parliament would endorse the dismissal. Parliament supported Hussein in a vote on 15 December, but Ahmed nevertheless appointed Mohamoud Mohamed Guled as Prime Minister to replace Hussein on 16 December.

On 21 December, Radio Garowe reported that 80 members of parliament held a conference in Baidoa where they all agreed that the vote of confidence in support of Hussein&#x27;s government never took place. Ismail Ali Nur, who spoke on behalf of the dissenting lawmakers, indicated that Somalia&#x27;s constitution requires a parliament quorum of no less than 139 MPs present for votes, but that &quot;only 95 MPs&quot; showed up as opposed to the 143 members of parliament claimed by Speaker Adan &quot;Madobe&quot; Mohamed. Nur urged people to &quot;watch video footage recorded from that session.&quot;

On 24 December, the newly appointed Prime Minister Guled announced his resignation, citing that he did not wish to be &quot;seen as a stumbling block to the peace process which is going well now.&quot;

Following Guled&#x27;s resignation, Abdirashid Sed, who was close to President Ahmed, said that Ahmed would announce his resignation and retirement from politics at a special session of Parliament on 29 December. According to Sed, Ahmed made this decision &quot;because he does not want to be seen as an obstacle to peace in Somalia&quot;.

=== Impeachment attempt and resignation ===
In December 2008, the TFG parliament moved to impeach President Abdullahi Yusuf, accusing him of being a dictator and an obstacle to peace.

On 29 December 2008, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed announced before a united parliament in Baidoa his resignation as President of Somalia. In his speech, which was broadcast on national radio, Ahmed expressed regret at failing to end the country&#x27;s 17-year conflict. Yusuf stated that he had lost control of the country to Islamist insurgents, and blamed the international community for its failure to support the government. He further announced said that the speaker of parliament, Aden &quot;Madobe&quot; Mohamed, would succeed him in office per the Transitional Federal Government&#x27;s Charter.

While it was suggested that Ahmed&#x27;s resignation added chaos to the country&#x27;s political landscape as Ethiopia withdrew its troops, some diplomats opined that it might have improved the prospects of striking a deal with the more moderate Islamist insurgents.

==Post-retirement==

After his exile from Somali politics, Ahmed was initially reported to have flown out of Baidoa back to his native Puntland in the northeast. He then arrived in Sana&#x27;a, the capital of Yemen, on 20 January 2009, along with his wife and 17 family members and guards. On 21 January, Al Arabiya reported that Ahmed was granted political asylum in Yemen, where he resided.

Yusuf spent the remainder of his life in the United Arab Emirates.

In 2011, Ahmed released his memoirs, titled &quot;Struggle and Conspiracy: A Memoir&quot; (&quot;Halgan iyo Hagardaamo: Taariikh Nololeed&quot;). He began a promotional European tour for the book late in the year and in early 2012.

==Death==
On 23 March 2012, relatives and Radio Mogadishu announced that Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed had died at age 77 from complications due to pneumonia. He had been receiving treatment for several weeks at the Zayed Military Hospital in Abu Dhabi, but had fallen into a coma over the previous few days.

Somalia&#x27;s Transitional Federal Government, which Ahmed had co-founded, declared a three-day period of mourning for the late ruler and appointed a ministerial-level committee for the scheduled funeral proceedings. Somali citizens also offered their condolences and prayers, particularly in the northeastern Puntland region, where Ahmed is regarded as a founding father. Upon learning of Ahmed&#x27;s death, Puntland Minister of State for Planning and International Cooperation, Abdulkadir Hashi, tweeted that &quot;President Yusuf&#x27;s death marks a huge loss for the Somali people and especially for Puntlanders. He was a great patriot &amp; friend&quot;.

Ahmed was flown to the Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu, where the Bombay army band conducted a military funeral service in his honor and a Janaza prayer was dedicated to him. On 25 March 2012, the former president was then taken to his hometown of Galkacyo for a state burial. A 22-gun salute was fired upon his arrival, and the ensuing funeral ceremony was attended by over two thousand people. Numerous government officials and religious and clan leaders came to pay their last respects, including incumbent Puntland president Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, former Puntland president Mohamud Muse Hersi, TFG president Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, and Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali. International delegations from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen, among many others, also attended the interment. President Farole gave a brief speech noting that &quot;Abdullahi was a patriotic man whose dedication and rigidness will inspire many to come.&quot;

In commemoration of the late leader, the Galkayo Airport was officially renamed as the Abdullahi Yusuf International Airport.

<text>Edmond Jabès (; ; Cairo, April 14, 1912 – Paris, January 2, 1991) was a French writer and poet of Egyptian origin, and one of the best known literary figures writing in French after World War II. The work he produced when living in France in the late 1950s until his death in 1991 is highly original in form and breadth.

== Life ==
The son of a prominent Jewish family in Egypt going back to the 19th century, he was born and brought up in Cairo where he received a classical French education. He began publishing in French and writing for the theater at an early age. From the 1930s on, he was active in Cairo&#x27;s artistic and literary avant-garde culture, while also nurturing relationships with poets and publishers in France. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1952 for his literary accomplishments. 

When Egypt expelled most of its Jewish population (Suez Crisis), Jabès fled to Paris in 1957. There he was welcomed by the literary community as a Surrealist-influenced poet, but a confrontation with French anti-semitism and the shadow of the Shoah prompted him to make a radical change in his writing, resulting in the multi-volume &quot;Book of Questions.&quot; His work after exile from Egypt reflects a consciousness deeply troubled by the brutal reality of Auschwitz. His work exhibits a profound sense of melancholy and an acute sense that the Jew is constituted and always remains in exile. It also highlights the importance of offering welcome to foreigners, a central theme in his last book, &quot;The Book of Hospitality.&quot; He became a French citizen in 1967; the same year he received the honor of being one of four French writers (alongside Sartre, Camus, and Lévi-Strauss) to present his works at the World Exposition in Montréal. Further accolades followed—the &quot;Prix des Critiques&quot; in 1972, and a commission as an officer in the Legion of Honor in 1986. In 1987, he received France&#x27;s Grand National Prize for Poetry (Grand Prix national de la poésie). Jabès&#x27;s cremation ceremony took place at Père Lachaise Cemetery a few days after his death; he was the victim of a heart attack in his apartment on the rue de l&#x27;Épée-de-Bois, dying at age 78.

== Works ==
Jabès is best remembered for his books of poetry, often published in multi-volume cycles, at least fourteen volumes have been translated by Rosmarie Waldrop – Jabès&#x27;s primary English translator. They often featured references to Jewish mysticism and kabbalah.

<text>Chicken Soup for the Soul, LLC is an American self-help and consumer goods company based in Cos Cob, Connecticut. It is known for the &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; book series. The first book, like most subsequent titles in the series, consisted of inspirational true stories about ordinary people&#x27;s lives. The books are widely varied, each with a different theme.

The company has branched out into other categories such as food, pet food, and television programming.

== History ==

=== Books ===
Motivational speakers Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen collaborated on the first &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; book, compiling inspirational, true stories they had heard from their audience members. Many of the stories came from members of the audience of their inspirational talks. The book was rejected by major publishers in New York but accepted by a small, self-help publisher in Florida called HCI.

After the success of the first book, Canfield and Hansen, with HCI, published additional, similar &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; titles. Later, they published &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; books for specific demographics, such as &quot;Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul&quot;, which came out in 1997 and was a major best-seller. New &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; titles and sequels to existing books have been published on a regular basis since the first book came out in 1993. In 2009, author Adeline Lee Zhia Ern was found to have plagiarized the story &quot;Happiness&quot; by Sarah Provençal from Jack Canfield&#x27;s &quot;Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul IV&quot;.

A 19-episode anthology series made up of stories from the series was produced and aired in the 1999–2000 television season by PAX TV, the current-day Ion Television.

=== Expansion from books ===
In 2008, the founders, Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, sold the company to a new ownership group led by William J. Rouhana and Robert D. Jacobs. Since then, all new titles have been published by &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul Publishing, LLC,&quot; and distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster.

Under the new ownership group, Chicken Soup for the Soul has expanded into other products besides books. The company markets pet foods under the brand Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover&#x27;s Soul and a line of soups, sauces, and other prepared foods under the brand Chicken Soup for the Soul.

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment went public in 2017. In November 2017, it acquired Screen Media Ventures, LLC, an independent television and film distribution company, which included Popcornflix, an ad-based online video service.

On July 10, 2024, a bankruptcy judge ordered Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment to undergo a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation after accusing Rouhana of misusing the business and failing to pay employees or support healthcare. With the Chapter 7 conversion, the company&#x27;s assets will be liquidated, resulting in the cessation of its subsidiaries, including Crackle, Popcornflix and Redbox. In addition, over 1,000 employees were laid off, and over 26,000 Redbox kiosks were shut down permanently.

== Awards ==
The original series held a spot on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list continuously from 1994 to 1998.

<doc id="1056842" wikidata="Q1144013" url="?curid=1056842" title="Streptomyces">
<text>Streptomyces is the largest genus of Actinomycetota, and the type genus of the family Streptomycetaceae. Over 700 species of &quot;Streptomyces&quot; bacteria have been described. As with the other Actinomycetota, streptomycetes are gram-positive, and have very large genomes with high GC content. Found predominantly in soil and decaying vegetation, most streptomycetes produce spores, and are noted for their distinct &quot;earthy&quot; odor that results from production of a volatile metabolite, geosmin. Different strains of the same species may colonize very diverse environments.

Streptomycetes are characterised by a complex secondary metabolism. Between 5-23% (average: 12%) of the protein-coding genes of each &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species are implicated in secondary metabolism. Streptomycetes produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin (e.g., neomycin, streptomycin, cypemycin, grisemycin, bottromycins and chloramphenicol). The antibiotic streptomycin takes its name directly from &quot;Streptomyces&quot;. Streptomycetes are infrequent pathogens, though infections in humans, such as mycetoma, can be caused by &quot;S. somaliensis&quot; and &quot;S. sudanensis&quot;, and in plants can be caused by &quot;S. caviscabies&quot;, &quot;S. acidiscabies&quot;, &quot;S. turgidiscabies&quot; and &quot;S. scabies&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
When Selman Waksman and Arthur Henrici in 1943 divided Actinomyces genus into narrower genera, they failed to find a valid generic name for aerobic sporulating species so had to coin a new one.

&quot;Streptomyces&quot; is the type genus of the family Streptomycetaceae and currently covers more than 700 species with the number increasing every year. It is estimated that the total number of &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species is close to 1600. Acidophilic and acid-tolerant strains that were initially classified under this genus have later been moved to &quot;Kitasatospora&quot; (1997) and &quot;Streptacidiphilus&quot; (2003). Species nomenclature are usually based on their color of hyphae and spores.

&quot;Saccharopolyspora erythraea&quot; was formerly placed in this genus (as &quot;Streptomyces erythraeus&quot;).

== Morphology ==

The genus &quot;Streptomyces&quot; includes aerobic, Gram-positive, multicellular, filamentous bacteria that produce well-developed vegetative hyphae (between 0.5-2.0 μm in diameter) with branches. They form a complex substrate mycelium that aids in scavenging organic compounds from their substrates. Although the mycelia and the aerial hyphae that arise from them are amotile, mobility is achieved by dispersion of spores. Spore surfaces may be hairy, rugose, smooth, spiny or warty. In some species, aerial hyphae consist of long, straight filaments, which bear 50 or more spores at more or less regular intervals, arranged in whorls (verticils). Each branch of a verticil produces, at its apex, an umbel, which carries from two to several chains of spherical to ellipsoidal, smooth or rugose spores. Some strains form short chains of spores on substrate hyphae. Sclerotia-, pycnidia-, sporangia-, and synnemata-like structures are produced by some strains.

== Genomics ==
The complete genome of &quot;&quot;S. coelicolor&quot; strain A3(2)&quot; was published in 2002. At the time, the &quot;&quot;S. coelicolor&quot; genome was thought to contain the largest number of genes of any bacterium. The chromosome is 8,667,507 bp long with a GC-content of 72.1%, and is predicted to contain 7,825 protein-encoding genes. In terms of taxonomy, &quot;S. coelicolor&quot; A3(2)&quot; belongs to the species &quot;S. violaceoruber&quot;, and is not a validly described separate species; &quot;&quot;S. coelicolor&quot; A3(2)&quot; is not to be mistaken for the actual &quot;S. coelicolor&quot; (Müller), although it is often referred to as &quot;S. coelicolor&quot; for convenience. The transcriptome and translatome analyses of the strain A3(2) were published in 2016.

The first complete genome sequence of &quot;S. avermitilis&quot; was completed in 2003. Each of these genomes forms a chromosome with a linear structure, unlike most bacterial genomes, which exist in the form of circular chromosomes. The genome sequence of &quot;S. scabiei&quot;, a member of the genus with the ability to cause potato scab disease, has been determined at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. At 10.1 Mbp long and encoding 9,107 provisional genes, it is the largest known &quot;Streptomyces&quot; genome sequenced, probably due to the large pathogenicity island.

The genomes of the various &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species demonstrate remarkable plasticity, via ancient single gene duplications, block duplications (mainly at the chromosomal arms) and horizontal gene transfer. The size of their chromosome varies from 5.7-12.1 Mbps (average: 8.5 Mbps), the number of chromosomally encoded proteins varies from 4983-10,112 (average: 7130), whereas their high GC content varies from 68.8-74.7% (average: 71.7%). The 95% soft-core proteome of the genus consists of approximately 2000-2400 proteins. The pangenome is open. In addition, significant genomic plasticity is observed even between strains of the same species, where the number of accessory proteins (at the species level) ranges from 250 to more than 3000. Intriguingly, a correlation has been observed between the number of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (siderophores, e-Polylysin and type III lanthipeptides) that are related to competition among bacteria, in &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species. Streptomycetes are major biomass degraders, mainly via their carbohydrate-active enzymes. Thus, they also need to evolve an arsenal of siderophores and antimicrobial agents to suppress competition by other bacteria in these nutrient-rich environments that they create. Several evolutionary analyses have revealed that the majority of evolutionarily stable genomic elements are localized mainly at the central region of the chromosome, whereas the evolutionarily unstable elements tend to localize at the chromosomal arms. Thus, the chromosomal arms emerge as the part of the genome that is mainly responsible for rapid adaptation at both the species and strain level.

== Biotechnology ==
Biotechnology researchers have used &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species for heterologous expression of proteins. Traditionally, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; was the species of choice to express eukaryotic genes, since it was well understood and easy to work with. Expression of eukaryotic proteins in &quot;E. coli&quot; may be problematic. Sometimes, proteins do not fold properly, which may lead to insolubility, deposition in inclusion bodies, and loss of bioactivity of the product. Though &quot;E. coli&quot; strains have secretion mechanisms, these are of low efficiency and result in secretion into the periplasmic space, whereas secretion by a Gram-positive bacterium such as a &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species results in secretion directly into the extracellular medium. In addition, &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species have more efficient secretion mechanisms than &quot;E.coli&quot;. The properties of the secretion system is an advantage for industrial production of heterologously expressed protein because it simplifies subsequent purification steps and may increase yield. These properties among others make &quot;Streptomyces&quot; spp. an attractive alternative to other bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. In addition, the inherently high genomic instability suggests that the various Streptomycetes genomes may be amenable to extensive genome reduction for the construction of synthetic minimal genomes with industrial applications.

== Plant pathogenic bacteria ==
Several species belonging to this genus have been found to be pathogenic to plants:
# &quot;S. scabiei&quot;
# &quot;S. acidiscabies&quot;
# &quot;S. europaeiscabiei&quot;
# &quot;S. luridiscabiei&quot;
# &quot;S. niveiscabiei&quot;
# &quot;S. puniciscabiei&quot;
# &quot;S. reticuliscabiei&quot;
# &quot;S. stelliscabiei&quot;
# &quot;S. turgidiscabies&quot; (scab disease in potatoes)
# &quot;S. ipomoeae&quot; (soft rot disease in sweet potatoes)
# &quot;S. brasiliscabiei&quot; (first species identified in Brazil)
# &quot;S. hilarionis&quot; and &quot;S. hayashii&quot; (new species identified in Brazil)

== Medicine ==
&quot;Streptomyces&quot; is the largest antibiotic-producing genus, producing antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic drugs, and also a wide range of other bioactive compounds, such as immunosuppressants. Almost all of the bioactive compounds produced by &quot;Streptomyces&quot; are initiated during the time coinciding with the aerial hyphal formation from the substrate mycelium.

=== Antifungals ===

Streptomycetes produce numerous antifungal compounds of medicinal importance, including nystatin (from &quot;S. noursei&quot;), amphotericin B (from &quot;S. nodosus&quot;), and natamycin (from &quot;S. natalensis&quot;).

=== Antibacterials ===
Members of the genus &quot;Streptomyces&quot; are the source for numerous antibacterial pharmaceutical agents; among the most important of these are:
* Chloramphenicol (from &quot;S. venezuelae&quot;)
* Daptomycin (from &quot;S. roseosporus&quot;)
* Fosfomycin (from &quot;S. fradiae&quot;)
* Lincomycin (from &quot;S. lincolnensis&quot;)
* Neomycin (from &quot;S. fradiae&quot;)
* Nourseothricin 
* Puromycin (from &quot;S. alboniger&quot;)
* Streptomycin (from &quot;S. griseus&quot;)
* Tetracycline (from &quot;S. rimosus&quot; and &quot;S. aureofaciens&quot;)
* Oleandomycin (from &quot;S. antibioticus&quot;)
* Tunicamycin (from &quot;S. torulosus&quot;)
* Mycangimycin (from &quot;Streptomyces sp. SPB74&quot; and &quot;S. antibioticus&quot;)
* Boromycin (from &quot;S. antibioticus&quot;)
* Bambermycin (from &quot;S. bambergiensis&quot; and &quot;S. ghanaensis&quot;, the active compound being moenomycins A and C)
* Vulgamycin

Clavulanic acid (from &quot;S. clavuligerus&quot;) is a drug used in combination with some antibiotics (like amoxicillin) to block and/or weaken some bacterial-resistance mechanisms by irreversible beta-lactamase inhibition.
Novel antiinfectives currently being developed include Guadinomine (from &quot;Streptomyces&quot; sp. K01-0509), a compound that blocks the Type III secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria.

=== Antiparasitic drugs ===
&quot;S. avermitilis&quot; is responsible for the production of one of the most widely employed drugs against nematode and arthropod infestations, avermectin, and thus its derivatives including ivermectin.

=== Other ===

Less commonly, streptomycetes produce compounds used in other medical treatments: migrastatin (from &quot;S. platensis&quot;) and bleomycin (from &quot;S. verticillus&quot;) are antineoplastic (anticancer) drugs; boromycin (from &quot;S. antibioticus&quot;) exhibits antiviral activity against the HIV-1 strain of HIV, as well as antibacterial activity. Staurosporine (from &quot;S. staurosporeus&quot;) also has a range of activities from antifungal to antineoplastic (via the inhibition of protein kinases).

&quot;S. hygroscopicus&quot; and &quot;S. viridochromogenes&quot; produce the natural herbicide bialaphos.

Saptomycins and Legonmycins are chemical compounds isolated from &quot;Streptomyces&quot;.

== Symbiosis ==
&quot;Sirex&quot; wasps cannot perform all of their own cellulolytic functions and so some &quot;Streptomyces&quot; do so in symbiosis with the wasps. Book &quot;et al.&quot; have investigated several of these symbioses. Book &quot;et al.&quot;, 2014 and Book &quot;et al.&quot;, 2016 identify several lytic isolates. The 2016 study isolates &quot;Streptomyces&quot; sp. Amel2xE9 and &quot;Streptomyces&quot; sp. LamerLS-31b and finds that they are equal in activity to the previously identified &quot;Streptomyces&quot; sp. SirexAA-E.

<doc id="1056847" wikidata="Q249893" url="?curid=1056847" title="Qashqai people">
<text>Qashqai people (pronounced ; ) are a Turkic tribal confederation in Iran. Almost all of them speak a Western Turkic (Oghuz) language known as the Qashqai language – which they call &quot;Turkī&quot; – as well as Persian (the national language of Iran) in formal use. The Qashqai mainly live in the provinces of Fars, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Bushehr and southern Isfahan, especially around the cities of Shiraz and Firuzabad in Fars.

The majority of Qashqai people were originally nomadic pastoralists and some remain so today. The traditional nomadic Qashqai traveled with their flocks twice yearly between the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480 km or 300 miles south and the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the Persian Gulf, to the southwest of Shiraz. The majority, however, have now become partially or wholly sedentary. The trend towards settlement has been increasing markedly since the 1960s under government pressure, and encouragement, which has built housing for those willing to settle, starting in the early 20th century during the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty. However, for those who continue their migratory lifestyle, the Iranian government maintains and controls travel corridors for the Qashqai and their livestock, and other populations practicing pastoral migrations.

The Qashqai are made up of five major tribes: the &quot;Amale&quot; (Qashqai) / &quot;Amaleh&quot; (Persian), the &quot;Dere-Shorlu / Darreh-Shuri&quot;, the &quot;Kashkollu / Kashkuli&quot;, the &quot;Shishbeyli / Sheshboluki&quot; and the &quot;Eymur / Farsimadan&quot;. Smaller tribes include the &quot;Qaracha / Qarache&#x27;i&quot;, &quot;Rahimli / Rahimi&quot; and &quot;Safi-Khanli / Safi-Khani&quot;.

== History ==

Historically, the Turkic-speaking people are believed to have arrived in Iran from Central Asia from the 11th or 12th century onwards.

Told to Marie-Tèrése Ullens by the Ilbeg Malek Mansur, brother of the Ilkhan, Nasser Khan, Chief of the Qashqa&#x27;i, in 1953:
The Qashqai were a significant political force in Qajar Iran during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During World War I, they were influenced by the German consular official Wilhelm Wassmuss and sided with the German Empire. During World War II, the Qashgais attempted to organize resistance against the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, receiving some ineffectual assistance from Nazi Germany in 1943 by the means of Operation ANTON, which (along with Operation FRANZ) proved a complete failure.

In 1945–1946 there was a major rebellion of a number of tribal confederacies, including the Qashgais, who fought valiantly until the invading Russians were repelled. The Qashgais revolted during 1962–1964 due to the land reforms of the White Revolution. The revolt was put down and within a few years many Qashqais had settled. Most of the tribal leaders were sent to exile. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, the living leader, Khosrow Khan Qashqai, returned to Iran from exile in the United States and Germany.

== Major tribes==

The Qashqai tribal confederation consists of five major tribes, including the Dareshuri, Farsimadan, Sheshboluki, Amaleh, and Kashkuli.

=== Amale / Amaleh ===
People of the Amaleh tribe were originally warriors and workmen attached to the household of the Ilkhani, or paramount chief; recruited from all the Qashqai tribes they constituted the Ilkhani&#x27;s bodyguard and retinue. By 1956, the Amaleh tribe comprised as many as 6,000 families.

=== Dere-Shorlu / Dareshuri / Darehshouri ===
The Dareshuri are said to have joined the Qashqai tribal confederation during the reign of Karim Khan Zand (1163-93/1750-79). According to Persian government statistics, there were about 5,169 Dareshuri families, or 27,396 individuals, in 1360 sh./1981. The Dareshuri were &quot;the greatest horse-breeders and owners among the Qashqai&quot;. The policy of forced sedentarization of the nomadic tribes pursued by Reza Shah Pahlavi (1304–20 SH./1925-41) resulted in the loss of 80–90 percent of the Dareshuri horses, but the tribe made a recovery after World War II. Reza Shah Pahlavi also executed Hossein khan Darehshouri the head of Darehshouri family in order to take back the control of the Fars province which was controlled by Darehshouri tribe during Ghajar empire.

=== Kashkollu / Kashkuli ===
During World War I, the Kashkuli khans supported the British in their struggle against Ṣowlat-al-Dowla (Iyl-khan) and the German agent, Wilhelm Wassmuss. After the war, Ṣowlat-al-Dowla punished the Kashkuli. He dismissed the Kashkuli leaders who had opposed him and &quot;deliberately set out to break up and impoverish the Kashkuli tribe&quot;. Two sections of the tribe, which consisted of elements which had been loyal to Ṣowlat-al-Dowla, were then separated from the main body of the tribe and given the status of independent tribes, becoming the Kashkuli Kuchak (&quot;Little Kashkuli&quot;) and Qarachahi tribes. The remaining tribe became known as the Kashkuli Bozorg (&quot;Big Kashkuli&quot;) tribe. The Kashkuli Bozorg tribe comprised 4,862 households in 1963. As Oliver Garrod observed, the Kashkuli Bozorg are &quot;especially noted for their Jajims, or tartan woolen blankets, and for the fine quality of their rugs and trappings&quot;.

=== Eymur / Farsimadan ===
The Farsimadan claim that they are of Ḵhalaj origin, and that, before moving to southern Persia, they dwelled in Ḵalajestan, a region southwest of Tehran. The tribe was already in Fars by the late 16th century, for it is known that in October 1590 their leader, Abul-Qasem Beyg and some of his followers were punished for having sided with Yaqub Khan the Zul-Qadr governor of Fars, in a revolt against Shah Abbas I. The population of the Farsimadan was estimated by Afshaar-Sistaani at 2,715 families or 12,394 individuals, in 1982.

== Culture ==

The Qashqai are pastoral nomads who rely on small-scale cultivation and shepherding. Traditional dress includes the use of decorated short tunics, wide-legged pants, and headscarves worn by women.

=== Carpeting and weaving ===
The Qashqai are renowned for their pile carpets and other woven wool products. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;Shiraz&quot; because Shiraz was the major marketplace for them in the past. The wool produced in the mountains and valleys near Shiraz is exceptionally soft and beautiful and takes a deeper color than wool from other parts of Iran.

:&quot;No wool in all Persia takes such a rich and deep colour as the Shiraz wool. The deep blue and the dark ruby red are equally extraordinary, and that is due to the brilliancy of the wool, which is firmer and, so to say, more transparent than silk, and makes one think of translucent enamel&quot;.

Qashqai carpets have been said to be &quot;probably the most famous of all Persian tribal weavings&quot;. Qashqai saddlebags, adorned with colorful geometric designs, &quot;are superior to any others made&quot;.

== Notable individuals ==

* One of the famous Qashqai tribe leaders, Ismail Khan Qashqai is known as Solat al-Dawla, the leader of the nomads (born 1257 AH / 1295 AH). The history of his struggles during the constitutional period as well as in the role he played in the Persian campaign of World War I is very significant. He is one of the famous Qashqai patriarchs who has played an important role in the history of the Qashqai tribe as well as in the political events of the country. Solat al-Dawla died in Qasr Prison in Tehran on October 6, 1931. (1350 AH?) [69]
* Another figure named Jahangir Khan Qashqaei is from the Darhshouri tribe (born 1206 AH / 1243 AH) who migrated with the tribe until he was 40 years old and had a primary school education. During a trip to Isfahan to repair his room, he encounters a person who advises him to pursue science. His prominent students include Mohammad Ali Shahabadi, Seyyed Hossein Tabatabai Boroujerdi, Seyyed Hassan Modarres, Nokhodaki Esfahani and others. He died in 1289 AH (1328 AH) and was buried in &quot;Isfahan Steel Throne&quot;. [70]

<text>Bachi (, ; also &quot;batchi&quot;) are straight wooden sticks used on Japanese taiko drums, and also the plectrum (written ) for stringed instruments of Japanese origin such as the shamisen and &quot;biwa&quot;.

== For percussion ==
Drum bachi (, ) are made in a wide variety of sizes and materials, as appropriate to the drum it will be used to play. A typical bachi is about 22 mm (7/8 inches) in diameter, 400 mm (16 inches) long and made out of a hardwood such as oak. These would be suitable for a wide variety of playing styles.

A bachi for playing a larger drum like the O-daiko would be bigger both in circumference and length. Similarly, smaller bachi are used for smaller drums.

Distinctions between the characters and are not always made in technical terms, but can also literally refer to the white oak tree, or Quercus. Some other woods commonly used to make bachi are (Japanese names in parentheses): , , , , and . Magnolia is one of the lightest and softest woods, most suitable for playing smaller drums with a sharp attack and less decay. On a larger drum, however, a magnolia bachi usually sounds &quot;slappy&quot; and flat, because it is too light to strike the thicker head of the drum with enough power to generate the lower tones of the drum. It is also too soft to strike the rim of the drum (in kuchi shoka, it is called a ) without denting the wood. Cypress is slightly harder than magnolia, and is usually cheaper as well. On the opposite extreme, an bachi is heavy and hard. It brings out a better, fuller sound when playing larger taiko, but it muffles the higher harmonics of smaller taiko, sounding &quot;thunky&quot; and dead.

Taiko drumming is a highly visual art form, and so bachi are sometimes decorated with bells or tassels for use during performance.

== For stringed instruments ==
Bachi used for stringed instruments () are actually picks. They are very distinct in form and use from Western-style picks, which are usually smaller in order to be held between or mounted to fingers. In shape, bachi are similar to an ice scraper or a putty knife. 

Bachi can be made of various materials and with varying levels of strength. Similarly to guitar picks, bachi were traditionally made of or , but these materials are rare and expensive (and illegal to trade in some territories, due to protection of endangered species), therefore making bachi in these materials highly expensive and impractical. Modern and more affordable variants are often made of acrylic, plastic or wood.

Generally, bachi made of softer, more flexible materials are easier to play with for beginners, but harder materials produce a stronger sound and last longer.

<doc id="1056866" wikidata="Q933491" url="?curid=1056866" title="GC-content">
<text>In molecular biology and genetics, GC-content (or guanine-cytosine content) is the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C). This measure indicates the proportion of G and C bases out of an implied four total bases, also including adenine and thymine in DNA and adenine and uracil in RNA.

GC-content may be given for a certain fragment of DNA or RNA or for an entire genome. When it refers to a fragment, it may denote the GC-content of an individual gene or section of a gene (domain), a group of genes or gene clusters, a non-coding region, or a synthetic oligonucleotide such as a primer.

==Structure==
Qualitatively, guanine (G) and cytosine (C) undergo a specific hydrogen bonding with each other, whereas adenine (A) bonds specifically with thymine (T) in DNA and with uracil (U) in RNA. Quantitatively, each GC base pair is held together by three hydrogen bonds, while AT and AU base pairs are held together by two hydrogen bonds. To emphasize this difference, the base pairings are often represented as &quot;G≡C&quot; versus &quot;A=T&quot; or &quot;A=U&quot;.

DNA with low GC-content is less stable than DNA with high GC-content; however, the hydrogen bonds themselves do not have a particularly significant impact on molecular stability, which is instead caused mainly by molecular interactions of base stacking. In spite of the higher thermostability conferred to a nucleic acid with high GC-content, it has been observed that at least some species of bacteria with DNA of high GC-content undergo autolysis more readily, thereby reducing the longevity of the cell &quot;per se&quot;. Because of the thermostability of GC pairs, it was once presumed that high GC-content was a necessary adaptation to high temperatures, but this hypothesis was refuted in 2001. Even so, it has been shown that there is a strong correlation between the optimal growth of prokaryotes at higher temperatures and the GC-content of structural RNAs such as ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, and many other non-coding RNAs. The AU base pairs are less stable than the GC base pairs, making high-GC-content RNA structures more resistant to the effects of high temperatures.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that the most important factor contributing to the thermal stability of double-stranded nucleic acids is actually due to the base stackings of adjacent bases rather than the number of hydrogen bonds between the bases. There is more favorable stacking energy for GC pairs than for AT or AU pairs because of the relative positions of exocyclic groups. Additionally, there is a correlation between the order in which the bases stack and the thermal stability of the molecule as a whole.

==Determination==

GC-content is usually expressed as a percentage value, but sometimes as a ratio (called G+C ratio or GC-ratio). GC-content percentage is calculated as

:formula_1

whereas the AT/GC ratio is calculated as 
:formula_2 .

The GC-content percentages as well as GC-ratio can be measured by several means, but one of the simplest methods is to measure the melting temperature of the DNA double helix using spectrophotometry. The absorbance of DNA at a wavelength of 260 nm increases fairly sharply when the double-stranded DNA molecule separates into two single strands when sufficiently heated. The most commonly used protocol for determining GC-ratios uses flow cytometry for large numbers of samples.

In an alternative manner, if the DNA or RNA molecule under investigation has been reliably sequenced, then GC-content can be accurately calculated by simple arithmetic or by using a variety of publicly available software tools, such as the free online GC calculator.

==Genomic content==
=== Within-genome variation ===
The GC-ratio within a genome is found to be markedly variable. These variations in GC-ratio within the genomes of more complex organisms result in a mosaic-like formation with islet regions called isochores. This results in the variations in staining intensity in chromosomes. GC-rich isochores typically include many protein-coding genes within them, and thus determination of GC-ratios of these specific regions contributes to mapping gene-rich regions of the genome.

=== Coding sequences ===
Within a long region of genomic sequence, genes are often characterised by having a higher GC-content in contrast to the background GC-content for the entire genome. There is evidence that the length of the coding region of a gene is directly proportional to higher G+C content. This has been pointed to the fact that the stop codon has a bias towards A and T nucleotides, and, thus, the shorter the sequence the higher the AT bias.

Comparison of more than 1,000 orthologous genes in mammals showed marked within-genome variations of the third-codon position GC content, with a range from less than 30% to more than 80%.

=== Among-genome variation === 
GC content is found to be variable with different organisms, the process of which is envisaged to be contributed to by variation in selection, mutational bias, and biased recombination-associated DNA repair.

The average GC-content in human genomes ranges from 35% to 60% across 100-Kb fragments, with a mean of 41%. The GC-content of Yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) is 38%, and that of another common model organism, thale cress (&quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;), is 36%. Because of the nature of the genetic code, it is virtually impossible for an organism to have a genome with a GC-content approaching either 0% or 100%. However, a species with an extremely low GC-content is &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; (GC% = ~20%), and it is usually common to refer to such examples as being AT-rich instead of GC-poor.

Several mammalian species (e.g., shrew, microbat, tenrec, rabbit) have independently undergone a marked increase in the GC-content of their genes. These GC-content changes are correlated with species life-history traits (e.g., body mass or longevity) and genome size, and might be linked to a molecular phenomenon called the GC-biased gene conversion.

==Applications==
=== Molecular biology ===
In polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments, the GC-content of short oligonucleotides known as primers is often used to predict their annealing temperature to the template DNA. A higher GC-content level indicates a relatively higher melting temperature.

Many sequencing technologies, such as Illumina sequencing, have trouble reading high-GC-content sequences. Bird genomes are known to have many such parts, causing the problem of &quot;missing genes&quot; expected to be present from evolution and phenotype but never sequenced — until improved methods were used.

=== Systematics ===
The species problem in non-eukaryotic taxonomy has led to various suggestions in classifying bacteria, and the &quot;ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics&quot; of 1987 has recommended use of GC-ratios in higher-level hierarchical classification. For example, the Actinomycetota are characterised as &quot;high GC-content bacteria&quot;. In &quot;Streptomyces coelicolor&quot; A3(2), GC-content is 72%. With the use of more reliable, modern methods of molecular systematics, the GC-content definition of Actinomycetota has been abolished and low-GC bacteria of this clade have been found.

==Software tools==
GCSpeciesSorter and TopSort are software tools for classifying species based on their GC-contents.

==Change of era==
* April 22, 1818 (): The new era name was created to mark the enthronement of the emperor Emperor Ninko in &quot;Bunka&quot; 15.

The new era name was drawn from an aphorism attributed to the ancient Chinese emperor, Great Shun (大舜): &quot;Shun reads the Heavens, and so brings together all seven governments&quot; (舜察天文、斉七政).

Von Siebold&#x27;s published accounts and unpublished writings provided a unique and useful perspective for Orientalists and Japanologists in the 19th century; and his work continues to be rigorously examined by modern researchers today.

<doc id="1056879" wikidata="Q7134952" url="?curid=1056879" title="Parallel Galaxy">
<text>Parallel Galaxy is the first solo album by American musician Emmett Chapman, released in 1985 on Backyard Records. The album is also one of the earliest to feature the Chapman Stick, a stringed instrument developed by Chapman. (Alphonso Johnson and Tony Levin had used a Stick a few years earlier).

This album represented both an example of Chapman&#x27;s artistry on the Stick, and also showed other musicians what was possible on the Stick. Though not a top-selling album, it inspired many musicians to pick up the Stick.

The track &quot;Back Yard&quot; appears in the Alan Smithee version of the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;.

The entire album was recorded without overdubs. It included Bruce Gary on drums, Josh Hanna on vocal effects and Dan Chapman (Emmett&#x27;s brother) on harmonica.

Initially released on vinyl, the album was remastered and released on CD in 1999.

==Track listing==
;Side 1
# &quot;Back Yard&quot;
# &quot;Margueritas In The Waves&quot;
# &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;

;Side 2
# &quot;A Lotus On Irish Streams&quot;
# &quot;Voices&quot;
# &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;
# &quot;Parallel galaxy&quot;
# &quot;Gypsy&quot;

==Reception==
A 1999 review of the album&#x27;s rerelease on CD for All About Jazz described the album as &quot;upbeat and playful&quot;, at its best reminiscent of country or bluegrass influenced jazz in the style of Bela Fleck or Les Paul, though somewhat dated and gimmicky: &quot;I find this an interesting listen but if it wasn’t extra-valued as Chapman’s debut Stick release I may have passed on it&quot;.

<doc id="1056889" wikidata="Q3365524" url="?curid=1056889" title="Parliament of Tasmania">
<text>The Parliament of Tasmania is the bicameral legislature of the Australian state of Tasmania. It follows a Westminster-derived parliamentary system and consists of the governor of Tasmania (as representative of the King), the Legislative Council (the upper house), and the House of Assembly (the lower house). Since 1841, the Legislative Council has met in Parliament House, Hobart, with the House of Assembly following suit from its establishment in 1856. The Parliament of Tasmania first met in 1856.

The powers of the Parliament are prescribed in the Constitution of Tasmania. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, Tasmania has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Constitution of Australia regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth. Under the Australian Constitution, Tasmania ceded certain legislative and judicial powers to the Commonwealth, but retained complete independence in all other areas.

The leader of the party or coalition with the confidence of the House of Assembly is invited by the governor to form the Government and become the premier of Tasmania.

Throughout its history, the Tasmanian Parliament frequently had members who previously served in Federal Parliament proportionally more so than the other state and territory parliaments.

The Government currently consists of a Liberal Lambie minority government, formed after the 2024 State Election. The Second Rockliff ministry consists of solely Liberal members.

==History==
The island of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now known as Tasmania) was claimed and subsequently settled by the United Kingdom in 1803. Initially, it was administered by the governor of New South Wales, as part of that British Colony of New South Wales. In 1825, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land became a separate British colony, administered separately from New South Wales, with a Legislative Council of six men appointed to advise the lieutenant governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land who had sole governance of the colony. The Council initially held meetings in a room adjacent to the old Government House that was located near to the present site of Franklin Square, but by 1841 they relocated meetings to the &#x27;Long Room&#x27; (now the Members&#x27; Lounge) in the Customs House.

In 1850, the British Parliament enacted the &quot;Australian Colonies Government Act&quot;, which gave Van Diemen&#x27;s Land the right to elect its first representative government. The size of the Legislative Council was increased from six to 24. Eight members were appointed by the Governor, and 16 were elected by property owners. The new Legislative Council met for the first time in 1852, and by 1854 they had passed the &quot;Tasmanian Constitution Act&quot;, giving Van Diemen&#x27;s Land responsible self-government and a new bicameral parliament. Queen Victoria granted Royal assent in 1855 and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land became a self-governing colony. In the following year, 1856, one of the new parliament&#x27;s first acts was to change the name of the colony from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land to Tasmania.

==Houses of Parliament==

===House of Assembly===

The Tasmanian House of Assembly is the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament. There are 35 members, with seven members elected from the five divisions. The divisions are: Bass, Braddon, Denison, Franklin, and Lyons. The Tasmanian House of Assembly electoral divisions share the same names and boundaries as the Australian House of Representatives divisions for Tasmania.

Members are elected using the Hare-Clark voting system of multi-member proportional representation for a term of up to 4 years.

====Current distribution of seats====
The current distribution of seats is:




===Legislative Council===

The Tasmanian Legislative Council is the upper house of the Tasmanian Parliament. It has 15 members, each elected from a single-member electoral division. The boundaries of the divisions are reviewed by tribunal every 9 years.

Elections are conducted annually on a 6-year periodic cycle; 3 divisions will be up for election in May one year, then 2 divisions in May the following year and so on. As such, each member will normally serve a term of 6 years.

<doc id="1056898" wikidata="Q7889858" url="?curid=1056898" title="United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia">
<text>The United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia (in case citations, W.D. Va.) is a United States district court.

Appeals from the Western District of Virginia are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The court is seated at multiple locations in Virginia: Abingdon, Charlottesville, Danville, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg and Roanoke.

== History ==
The United States District Court for the District of Virginia was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789.

On February 13, 1801, the Judiciary Act of 1801, , divided Virginia into three judicial districts: the District of Virginia, which included the counties west of the Tidewater and south of the Rappahannock River; the District of Norfolk, which included the Tidewater counties south of the Rappahannock; and the District of Potomac, which included the counties north and east of the Rappahannock as well as Maryland counties along the Potomac. Just over a year later, on March 8, 1802, the Judiciary Act of 1801 was repealed and Virginia became a single District again, , effective July 1, 1802.

The District of Virginia was subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on February 4, 1819, by . At that time, West Virginia, was still part of Virginia, and was encompassed in Virginia&#x27;s Western District, while the Eastern District essentially covered what is now the entire state of Virginia. With the division of West Virginia from Virginia during the American Civil War, the Western District of Virginia became the District of West Virginia, and those parts of the Western District that were not part of West Virginia were combined with the Eastern District to form again a single District of Virginia on June 11, 1864, by . Congress again divided Virginia into Eastern and the Western Districts on February 3, 1871, by .


== Counties of jurisdiction ==

The Western District of Virginia covers the counties of Albemarle, Alleghany, Amherst, Appomattox, Augusta, Bath, Bedford, Bland, Botetourt, Buchanan, Buckingham, Campbell, Carroll, Charlotte, Clarke, Craig, Culpeper, Cumberland, Dickenson, Floyd, Fluvanna, Franklin, Frederick, Giles, Grayson, Greene, Halifax, Henry, Highland, Lee, Louisa, Madison, Montgomery, Nelson, Orange, Page, Patrick, Pittsylvania, Pulaski, Rappahannock, Roanoke, Rockbridge, Rockingham, Russell, Scott, Shenandoah, Smyth, Tazewell, Warren, Washington, Wise, and Wythe; and the independent cities of Bedford, Bristol, Buena Vista, Charlottesville, Covington, Danville, Galax, Harrisonburg, Lexington, Lynchburg, Martinsville, Norton, Radford, Roanoke, Salem, Staunton, Waynesboro, and Winchester.

<doc id="1056905" wikidata="Q891821" url="?curid=1056905" title="Bombay (film)">
<text>Bombay is a 1995 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam, starring Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala (in her Tamil film debut). The film tells the story of an inter-religious family in Bombay before and during the Bombay riots, which took place between December 1992 and January 1993 after the demolition of the Babri Masjid led to religious tensions between Hindu and Muslim communities. It is the second installment in Ratnam&#x27;s trilogy of films that depict human relationships against a background of Indian politics, including &quot;Roja&quot; (1992) and &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998).

&quot;Bombay&quot; was released on 10 March 1995. The film was well-received both critically and commercially successful. It was screened at many international film festivals including the Philadelphia Film Festival in 1996. The film&#x27;s soundtrack earned composer A. R. Rahman his fourth consecutive Filmfare Best Music Director Award (Tamil), and is considered one of the greatest Indian soundtracks of all time. However, the film caused considerable controversy upon release in India and abroad for its depiction of inter-religious relations between a Muslim woman and a Hindu man. The film was banned in Singapore and Malaysia upon release.

In July 2005, a book on the film by Lalitha Gopalan was published by BFI Modern Classics, looking at the film&#x27;s production, the several issues it covered, and its impact upon release in India and abroad. The film was ranked among the top 20 Indian films in the British Film Institute&#x27;s rankings.

== Plot ==
Shekhar is the son of an orthodox Hindu Narayana Pillai living in a coastal village in Tamil Nadu. A journalism student studying in Bombay, Shekhar visits home to be with his family. On one of his return trips, he notices Shaila Banu, a Muslim schoolgirl in the village and falls in love with her. She happen to be his sister&#x27;s friend. Initially shy, Shaila seeks to distance herself from Shekhar, but after frequent run-ins, and days of pursuit, Shaila begins to like Shekhar. Eventually, they both fall in love.

Shekhar meets Shaila&#x27;s father, Basheer, and says he wants to marry Shaila. Basheer refuses, citing differences in religions. Shekhar reveals his interest to his father, who becomes angry, meets Basheer, and gets into an abusive argument with him. Upset with rejection from both families, Shekhar returns to Bombay. Through a friend of hers, he sends Shaila a letter and a ticket for her to travel to Bombay. However, she is undecided; Basheer learns of her regular letters from Shekhar and plans to get her married stop this relationship from growing further. Left with no choice, Shaila leaves the village with the ticket Sekar sent and reaches Bombay.

Shekhar and Shaila marry and lead a happy life. In a year, Shaila conceives and delivers twin boys who are named Kabir Narayan and Kamal Basheer. The twins are raised in both religions. Shekhar continues to work as a journalist, while Shaila takes care of her home and children. In six years, Shekhar and Shaila firmly settle down. 

When the Babri Masjid is demolished on 6 December 1992, riots break out in Bombay. Kabir and Kamal, who had gone to buy groceries, get caught in the riots; eventually, Shekhar and Shaila save them and reach home safely. Narayana Pillai, who receives the news of the riots, rushes to Bombay to meet his son and his family. He reconciles with his son and everyone is happy with his arrival, and he stays with them. Soon, Basheer also comes with his wife and all of them live together happily for a few days. Both Pillai and Basheer are happy with their grandchildren; they try to get both into their religions and wish to be with them.

On 5 January 1993, when two murders are propagated as communal killings, another riot breaks out in Bombay, raising tensions between religious communities. Hindus and Muslims clash in the streets, resulting in hundreds of deaths on both sides. During the conflict, arsonists set fire to the apartment where Shekhar lives with his family. Shekhar tries to evacuate everyone, but Narayana Pillai, Basheer and his wife fail to escape in time and are killed in an explosion. In the confusion of the panicking crowds, Kamal and Kabir are separated from their parents.

Kamal is saved by a transgender woman who cares for him and protects him, while Kabir searches aimlessly for his brother. Shekhar and Shaila begin to search for them, and they go through several tense moments, as they check the morgues and hospitals for their children. Shekhar grows emotional and participates in the movement to stop the riots with other moderate religious leaders, ultimately succeeding. When the riots end, Shaila and Shekhar are reunited with their children tearfully as the people on the streets join hands, regardless of age or religion.

== Cast ==
Additionally, Sonali Bendre and Nagendra Prasad appear in the item number &quot;Humma Humma&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
During the recording of the background score of Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Thiruda Thiruda&quot; (1993), the Bombay riots broke out. Mani Ratnam planned on making a film in Malayalam about a boy who gets lost in the riots, and requested M. T. Vasudevan Nair to write the script. This was supposed to be Mani Ratnam&#x27;s second Malayalam film after &quot;Unaroo&quot; (1985). But since the idea did not materialise, he decided to make it in Tamil as the film that would later be titled &quot;Bombay&quot;. According to Ratnam, &quot;Bombay&quot; was not originally planned as a political film: &quot;It was a phase India was going through and these things affected me and found their way into my work.&quot;

=== Casting ===

Aishwarya Rai was considered for the female lead, but she opted out due to unavailability of dates, with the production schedules clashing with her Miss World pageant, a title she went on to win. Mani Ratnam held a photoshoot for the film with Vikram and Manisha Koirala, but eventually excluded Vikram as he was unwilling to shave his beard and long hair that he had grown for the production of another film during the period, &quot;Pudhiya Mannargal&quot; (1994); the role went to Arvind Swamy. Koirala has stated that, though some people advised her against accepting the project since she had to play a mother, she did not listen as there were others who said &quot;it&#x27;ll be foolish to refuse a Mani Ratnam film&quot;. Koirala&#x27;s voice was dubbed by Rohini. Nassar, a Muslim in real life, was cast as the father of Swamy&#x27;s character (a Hindu) while Kitty, a Hindu in real life, was cast as the father of Koirala&#x27;s character (a Muslim). Ratnam deliberately cast them in those roles as a statement. Twins Harsha and Hriday were chosen to play the protagonists&#x27; twin sons, from over 70 twins that the director saw but was not impressed. &quot;Bombay&quot; remains Hriday&#x27;s only release.

=== Filming ===
When Ratnam approached cinematographer Rajiv Menon to shoot &quot;Bombay&quot;, he described it as a film about the riots and said that he (Menon) needed to &quot;(make what came before) the riots as beautiful as possible&quot;. So, Menon suggested shooting in the rains to achieve the effect. They shot the interiors of homes in Pollachi in Tamil Nadu and the exteriors were shot in Kasaragod, and Kannur village in Kerala. The song &quot;Kannalane&quot; was shot at Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal, and &quot;Uyire&quot; was shot at Bekal Fort. The demolition of the Babri Masjid was shown onscreen through newspaper headlines and photographs, as the Censor Board did not want the makers to show the actual destruction.

== Themes and influences ==
Mani Ratnam described &quot;Bombay&quot; as &quot;a positive film about communal harmony&quot;. He said the Bombay riots were not the main focus of the film, but &quot;a helpless, innocent man caught up in violence not of his own making.&quot; The film is the second installment in Ratnam&#x27;s trilogy of films that depict human relationships against a background of Indian politics, including &quot;Roja&quot; (1992) and &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998). &quot;Bangalore Mirror&quot; compared it to the theme of the 1990 movie &quot;Come See the Paradise&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack album for &quot;Bombay&quot; was composed by A. R. Rahman, in his third collaboration with Mani Ratnam after &quot;Roja&quot; and &quot;Thiruda Thiruda&quot;. The lyrics for the Tamil version were written by Vairamuthu. The soundtrack of the film became one of the best-selling Indian music albums of all time, with sales of 15million units. The soundtrack was included in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s &quot;1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die&quot; list, and the song &quot;Kannalanae&quot; sung by K. S. Chithra was included in their &quot;1000 Songs Everyone Must Hear&quot; list. &quot;Bombay Theme&quot; has appeared in various international films and music compilations, while the songs &quot;Kannalanae&quot; and &quot;Bombay Theme&quot; have been sampled by various international artists.

== Release ==
&quot;Bombay&quot; was released on 10 March 1995. The Telugu-dubbed version was released on the same day. It was previously scheduled to release in January 1995, during Pongal. The film caused considerable controversy upon release in India and abroad for its depiction of inter-religious relations between a Muslim woman and a Hindu man. The film was banned in Singapore and Malaysia upon release. Two homemade bombs were thrown at the house of Mani Ratnam, who had to be hospitalised with shrapnel injuries.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The Hindi version of the film grossed , as reported by Box Office India, making it one of the year&#x27;s ten highest-grossing Hindi films.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot;, in a review dated 19 March 1995, rated the film 53 out of 100. Anand Kannan, writing for &quot;Planet Bollywood&quot;, said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t call this the best of Mani Ratnam [...] But good acting, a socially conscious theme and a quick pace make the movie well worth watching.&quot; In 1996, American critic James Berardinelli rated the film 3.5 out of 4 and said, &quot;Largely because of their limited North American appeal and dubious quality, Indian movies are routinely ignored by distributors [...] Occasionally, however, a worthwhile picture causes enough people to take notice that it becomes a favorite on the international film festival circuit. One such movie is &quot;Bombay&quot;, the fourteenth feature from celebrated director Mani Rathnam.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Director Rathnam has shown great courage in making this picture (bombs were thrown at his house after it opened in India), which speaks with a voice that many will not wish to hear. &quot;Bombay&quot; recalls how forceful a motion picture can be.&quot; R. P. R. of &quot;Kalki&quot; wrote that with far cry from average cinema, this film raises a thousand questions about social morality, not just Mani Ratnam; it has given every Indian a chance to be proud.

<doc id="1056909" wikidata="Q7941298" url="?curid=1056909" title="Volvo B9TL">
<text>The Volvo B9TL is a low-floor double-decker bus built by Volvo from 2002 until 2018. It superseded the Volvo Super Olympian and the Volvo B7TL. The 2-axle version has been superseded by the Volvo B5TL in 2014 and the 3-axle version has been superseded by the Volvo B8L in 2018.

==Chassis==
The Volvo B9TL chassis shared the same design of the Volvo B7TL. The key difference from both its predecessors, the Volvo Super Olympian and Volvo B7TL, was a new 9.3-litre engine originally designed by Renault Trucks, now a subsidiary of Volvo. The radiator was located at the rear offside, similar to the smaller B7TL. The front module design was shared with other low-floor bus chassis built by Volvo, and independent suspension is fitted at the front axle (replaced by conventional front suspension after some years of production).

The B9TL was initially offered in three-axle format, and the two-axle variant was added in 2006 to replace the B7TL. The driveline comprises a Volvo D9A Euro III engine (rated at 300 hp or 340 hp), which was later replaced by the Volvo D9B Euro IV/V/EEV engine (using selective catalytic reduction technology; two versions were offered - the D9B260 rated at 260 hp for two-axle version, and a higher powered D9B310, rated at 310 hp, for three-axle version), and coupled to ZF 5-speed or 6-speed automatic gearbox. Volvo also offered the Voith four-speed gearbox as an alternative gearbox option.

==Asia Pacific==
===Hong Kong===
====Kowloon Motor Bus====
A Volvo B9TL prototype with a Volgren CR223LD body was delivered to Hong Kong in July 2003 for Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) as a demonstrator for the &quot;Eco-Driveline&quot; concept. It was put into service in April 2004 and registered as MF5119.

In early 2004, a Volvo B9TL prototype with a facelifted version of the TransBus Enviro500 body arrived in Hong Kong and registered as LU3721. It had a slightly different front and rear design, and its rear route box was moved beneath the upper deck rear window. After TransBus International was renamed Alexander Dennis in May 2004, it became the only TransBus Enviro-series bus with a non-Dennis chassis as well as the only facelifted version of the Enviro500 to be manufactured during this period.

Later in the same year, a Wright-bodied B9TL prototype was also delivered. The rear design of its Wright body was different from that of the Wright-bodied Volvo Super Olympian, with the number plate moved beneath (and a little to the right of) the rear route box.

In 2005, KMB ordered 63 B9TL chassis with Wright bodywork and 50 with Enviro500 bodies. The Wright-bodied buses entered service between 2005 and 2006, and the Enviro500-bodied buses entered service in late 2006/2007. These were followed by another 35 buses with Enviro500 bodywork, they entered service in 2007/2008.

In 2009, KMB ordered 60 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied B9TLs, quickly followed by another 115, they have begun delivery as of early 2010. These were followed by an order for a further 115 Wright-bodied B9TLs in 2010. All these buses entered service between 2010 and 2012.

A 10.6-metre 2-axle B9TL was put into service by KMB in 2010. It was equipped with a Volvo D9B-310 engine and a ZF EcoLife 6AP1403B gearbox.

Starting from June 2017, some of the new B9TLs were painted with the new livery of red and silver stripes, with the motto &quot;Heartbeat of the City&quot; shown on the top of the vehicle. The last Wright-bodied 12-metre B9TL was put into service in August 2019.

KMB ordered three Gemilang bodied B9TLs in 2017. They were registered in September 2018 and entered service in March 2019.

As of July 2020, there are 953 Volvo B9TLs in service with KMB.

====Long Win Bus====
Long Win Bus received 10 B9TL with Alexander Dennis Enviro500 bodywork which entered service in 2007/2008. All vehicles in this batch are almost identical to those with Kowloon Motor Bus.

Due to a surplus in Long Win&#x27;s fleet, all of them have been transferred to KMB from 2020 to 2022.

====Citybus and New World First Bus====

Citybus received one Wright Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied two-axle B9TL (fleet number 7500) on 31 July 2010. This vehicle was first registered in November 2010 and entered service in the following month.

Citybus and New World First Bus placed an order for 51 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied tri-axle in March 2014, including 50 11.3-metre buses and a 12.8-metre bus for Citybus. They were assembled by Wrightbus&#x27;s new partner, Masdef, in Malaysia.

Citybus and New World First Bus placed another order of 65 B9TLs in 2015, including 40 11.3-metre and 25 12-metres buses. All of these have been put into service since 2016.

====Discovery Bay Transit Services====
Discovery Bay Transit Services (DBTSL) from Discovery Bay placed an order of six 12.0m Wright Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied B9TL in 2014. They are equipped with Volvo D9B-310 engine and ZF EcoLife 6AP1403B gearbox. All vehicles were delivered between June and July 2015. They entered service on 16 August 2015.

====MTR Bus====
MTR Bus took delivery of 68 11.3-metres Wright Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied B9TLs in 2016/2017. This batch of buses are equipped with Volvo D9B-310 engine and Voith DIWA 864.5 gearbox. They are used to replace the aged Dennis Trident buses.

===Singapore===
SBS Transit of Singapore placed an order for 150 B9TL chassis on 28 December 2004, then the largest single order of B9TLs, which were fitted with bodywork from ComfortDelGro Engineering (CDGE), part of SBS Transit&#x27;s parent company. An additional order for 50 more chassis was placed in 2006 at a cost of S$29 million soon after putting its first B9TLs into operation, bringing the total fleet size to 200. These buses were delivered by October 2007. These were the only SBS Transit owned buses to be repainted into Lush Green livery during their lifespan. All Volvo B9TL CDGEs were retired from March 2021 to September 2023. One bus was converted to a Bus Engineering Lab at ITE College West upon retirement.

From 2009 to 2014, SBS Transit and the Land Transport Authority procured a grand total of 1,606 Volvo B9TLs with Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodywork. These buses were split into 5 batches based on technical specifications and interior configurations. Batches 1 and 2 were low-entry version buses while the Batches 3, 4 and 5 were low-floor version buses. 

On 13 August 2009, SBS Transit announced an order of 150 Volvo B9TLs (Batch 1), with Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodies, replacing 55 Leyland Olympian 3-Axles and 8 Volvo Olympian 2-Axles. These B9TLs were delivered between 13 September 2010 and 26 August 2011. One demonstrator (SBS7500D) was built by Wrightbus in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. It was later delivered to Singapore and entered revenue service in November 2010, whereas all other double-deck B9TLs were bodied by ComfortDelGro Engineering (CDGE) at Hougang. On 6 September 2010, SBS Transit ordered another 300 Wright-bodied Volvo B9TLs (Batch 2 and 3), delivered between 21 September 2011 and 28 December 2012, replacing the rest of Leyland Olympian 3-Axles and 3 Volvo Olympian 3-Axles (Batch 1). 30 buses (Batch 2) were delivered as low-entry, while the remaining 270 buses (Batch 3) were delivered completely low-floor. In 2012, 30 of the Batch 3 low-floor buses were diverted to the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP).

On 9 July 2012, SBS Transit ordered another 565 Wright-bodied Volvo B9TLs (Batch 4), delivered between 30 January 2013 and 18 June 2015, to replace most of their older buses, as well as fleet additions and introduction of new bus routes under the BSEP. SBS Transit&#x27;s final order of 415 Volvo B9TLs (Batch 5) was announced on 1 July 2014, two years before the transition of Singapore&#x27;s bus industry to the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s (LTA) Bus Contracting Model in 2016 having only 94 units delivered. The orders for the remaining 321 Volvo B9TLs were subsequently inherited by the LTA for the BCM and an additional 176 Volvo B9TLs were also subsequently ordered by the LTA. These buses are currently operated by all public transport operators. The last Volvo B9TL buses were registered on 27 December 2017.

Due to the enormous quantity of Volvo B9TLs procured, especially those bodied with the Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodywork, these buses have become a ubiquitous sight in Singapore. These buses can be found in large numbers in every town.

==Australia==
Volgren bodied B9TLs were purchased by CDC Melbourne and Thompsons Bus Service.

==Europe==
===United Kingdom===
In three-axle form, the B9TL made its debut in the United Kingdom when Weavaway Travel of Newbury placed an order for six B9TL with East Lancs Myllennium Nordic bodywork in late 2004 and put them into service in April/May 2005. Since then, two more were sold to Roadliner of Poole and Provence Private Hire of St Albans for school contracts and commercial work.

The two-axle Volvo B9TL did not make its debut in the United Kingdom until the middle of 2006. The first demonstrator, with Wright Eclipse Gemini body, was delivered to London General in July 2006 for evaluation, it is used on route 11. The first order was secured from Delaine Buses for two examples with the new East Lancs Olympus bodywork. The first Olympus-bodied B9TL, along with an Alexander Dennis Enviro400-bodied version, were both unveiled at the 2006 Euro Bus Expo at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham during November.

Initial sales of the two-axle version were slow in Britain, particularly in London, after falling foul with the noise and capacity requirements imposed by Transport for London. Eventually orders were also received for the Volvo B9TLs by First London, Go-Ahead London and Metroline. The B9TL had success with Lothian Buses, FirstGroup, East Yorkshire Motor Services, Highland Scottish, Yorkshire Coastliner and Flights Hallmark, Tower Transit where orders were received from 2007 to 2014.

The first order from Arriva was for 10 East Lancs Visionaire open top buses for The Original Tour in January 2007; and delivered in April - November 2007. An additional 16 buses were delivered in October 2011 - February 2012.

It was followed by an order for 16 buses with Darwen Olympus bodywork in high specification featuring leather seats for Arriva Yorkshire entering service between January and May 2008.

London General brought three buses on the Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 bodies for use on route 85. Afterwards, they are then reallocated to Sutton Bus Garage, operating on routes 93, 151, 154, and 213. These buses are now operated by metrobus - across the Crawley area - as in 03/09/2024.

In Northern Ireland, Translink purchased 125 Volvo B9TLs, all bodied by Wrightbus.
===Ireland===
Dublin Bus of Dublin, Ireland placed an order for 20 B9TL with single-door Alexander Dennis Enviro500 bodywork in early 2005. These buses were the largest in the fleet and also the first tri-axle double deckers for the Irish capital, the first of them entered service in December 2005. They were withdrawn and sold in December 2018.

In 2007, Dublin Bus ordered 50 B9TL with Alexander Dennis Enviro400 bodywork and another 50 B9TL with Alexander Dennis Enviro500 bodywork for delivery in 2007/2008. The two-axle buses entered service in summer/autumn 2007, and the three-axle buses entered service in December 2007/early 2008. Later Dublin Bus ordered 50 B9TL with Alexander Dennis Enviro400 bodywork and 50 B9TL with Wright Eclipse Gemini bodywork for delivery in 2008/2009. In 2012, Dublin Bus received 80 B9TL with Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodywork, but retaining the older Eclipse Gemini front. A further 80 B9TL with Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodywork, were received by Dublin Bus in 2013.

Bus Éireann also put 10 Wright Eclipse Gemini-bodied Volvo B9TL into service in late 2008, and a further 10 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied Volvo B9TL in 2012.

===Other European cities===

A number of two-axle Volvo B9TL open top buses were sold to a number of cities in Europe for sightseeing purposes.

==Successors==
The 2-axle Volvo B9TL was replaced by the Volvo B5TL in 2014. The 3-axle Volvo B9TL was replaced by the Volvo B8L in 2018.

<doc id="1056911" wikidata="Q1598365" url="?curid=1056911" title="Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia">
<text>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the development of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel). When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets, which release microparticles that activate thrombin, leading to thrombosis. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.

The treatment of HIT requires stopping heparin treatment, and both protection from thrombosis and choice of an agent that will not reduce the platelet count any further. Several alternatives are available for this purpose; mainly used are danaparoid, fondaparinux, argatroban, and bivalirudin.

While purified heparin was first used in humans in the 1930s, HIT was not reported until the 1960s.

==Signs and symptoms==
Heparin may be used for both prevention and the treatment of thrombosis. It exists in two main forms: an &quot;unfractionated&quot; form that can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) or through an intravenous infusion, and a &quot;low molecular weight&quot; form that is generally given subcutaneously. Commonly used low molecular weight heparins are enoxaparin, dalteparin, nadroparin and tinzaparin.

In HIT, the platelet count in the blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Most people with HIT, therefore, do not experience any symptoms. Typically, the platelet count falls 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.

The most common symptom of HIT is enlargement or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or the development of a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction (&quot;heart attack&quot;), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originates in the leg, but migrates to the lung.

In those receiving heparin through an intravenous infusion, a complex of symptoms (&quot;systemic reaction&quot;) may occur when the infusion is started. These include fever, chills, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest pain. This happens in about a quarter of people with HIT. Others may develop a skin rash consisting of red spots.

==Mechanism==
The administration of heparin can cause the development of HIT antibodies, suggesting heparin may act as a hapten, thus may be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, those who have been exposed to heparin in the last few months may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.

The IgG antibodies form a complex with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The tail of the antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein on the surface of the platelet. This results in platelet activation and the formation of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the platelet count falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia. In addition, the reticuloendothelial system (mostly the spleen) removes the antibody-coated platelets, further contributing to the thrombocytopenia.

Formation of PF4-heparin antibodies is common in people receiving heparin, but only a proportion of these develop thrombocytopenia or thrombosis. This has been referred to as an &quot;iceberg phenomenon&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
HIT may be suspected if blood tests show a falling platelet count in someone receiving heparin, even if the heparin has already been discontinued. Professional guidelines recommend that people receiving heparin have a complete blood count (which includes a platelet count) on a regular basis while receiving heparin.

However, not all people with a falling platelet count while receiving heparin turn out to have HIT. The timing, severity of the thrombocytopenia, the occurrence of new thrombosis, and the presence of alternative explanations, all determine the likelihood that HIT is present. A commonly used score to predict the likelihood of HIT is the &quot;4 Ts&quot; score introduced in 2003. A score of 0–8 points is generated; if the score is 0–3, HIT is unlikely. A score of 4–5 indicates intermediate probability, while a score of 6–8 makes it highly likely. Those with a high score may need to be treated with an alternative drug, while more sensitive and specific tests for HIT are performed, while those with a low score can safely continue receiving heparin, as the likelihood that they have HIT is extremely low. In an analysis of the reliability of the 4T score, a low score had a negative predictive value of 0.998, while an intermediate score had a positive predictive value of 0.14 and a high score a positive predictive value of 0.64; intermediate and high scores, therefore, warrant further investigation.

The first screening test in someone suspected of having HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay type. This ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested for the release of serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.

If someone has been diagnosed with HIT, some recommend routine Doppler sonography of the leg veins to identify deep vein thromboses, as this is very common in HIT.

==Treatment==
Given the fact that HIT predisposes strongly to new episodes of thrombosis, simply discontinuing the heparin administration is insufficient. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 × 109/L because a very high risk of warfarin necrosis exists in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as a theoretical risk indicates that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.

Various nonheparin agents are used as alternatives to heparin therapy to provide anticoagulation in those with strongly suspected or proven HIT: danaparoid, fondaparinux, bivalirudin, and argatroban. Not all agents are available in all countries, and not all are approved for this specific use. For instance, argatroban is only recently licensed in the United Kingdom, and danaparoid is not available in the United States. Fondaparinux, a factor Xa inhibitor, is commonly used off label for HIT treatment in the United States.

According to a systematic review, people with HIT treated with lepirudin showed a relative risk reduction of clinical outcome (death, amputation, etc.) to be 0.52 and 0.42 when compared to patient controls. In addition, people treated with argatroban for HIT showed a relative risk reduction of the above clinical outcomes to be 0.20 and 0.18. Lepirudin production stopped on May 31, 2012.

==Epidemiology==
Up to 8% of patients receiving heparin are at risk to develop HIT antibodies, but only 1–5% on heparin will progress to develop HIT with thrombocytopenia and subsequently one-third of them may develop arterial or venous thrombosis. After vascular surgery, 34% of patients receiving heparin developed HIT antibodies without clinical symptoms. The exact number of cases of HIT in the general population is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.

==History==
While heparin was introduced for clinical use in the late 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with heparin was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association. The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with thrombocytopenia was reported in 1969; prior to this time, platelet counts were not routinely performed. A 1973 report established HIT as a diagnosis, as well as suggesting that its features were the result of an immune process.

Initially, various theories existed about the exact cause of the low platelets in HIT. Gradually, evidence accumulated on the exact underlying mechanism. In 1984–1986, John G. Kelton and colleagues at McMaster University Medical School developed the laboratory tests that could be used to confirm or exclude heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Treatment was initially limited to aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw the introduction of a number of agents that could provide anticoagulation without a risk of recurrent HIT. Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, nonimmune mediated and self-limiting fall in platelet count) and type 2, the form described above. Currently, the term HIT is used without a modifier to describe the immune-mediated severe form.

In 2021 a condition resembling HIT but without heparin exposure was described to explain unusual post-vaccination embolic and thrombotic events after the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. It is a rare adverse event (1:1 million to 1:100,000) resulting from COVID-19 vaccines (particularly adenoviral vector vaccines). This is also known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS.

<doc id="1056915" wikidata="Q1123841" url="?curid=1056915" title="Concept art">
<text>Concept art is a form of visual art used to convey an idea for use in film, video games, animation, comic books, television shows, or other media before it is put into the final product. The term was used by the Walt Disney Animation Studios as early as the 1930s. Concept art usually refers to world-building artwork used to inspire the development of media products, and is not the same as storyboard, though they are often confused.

Concept art is developed through several iterations. Multiple solutions are explored before settling on the final design. Concept art is not only used to develop the work but also to show the project&#x27;s progress to directors, clients, and investors. Once the development of the work is complete, concept art may be reworked and used for advertising materials.

== Overview of the Industry ==
A concept artist is an individual who generates a visual design for an item, character, or area that does not yet exist. This includes, but is not limited to, film, animation, and more recently, video game production. Being a concept artist takes commitment, vision, and a clear understanding of the role.

While it is necessary to have the skills of a fine artist, a concept artist must also be able to work under strict deadlines in the capacity of a graphic designer. Some concept artists may start as fine artists, industrial designers, animators, or even special effects artists. Interpretation of ideas and how they are realized is where the concept artist&#x27;s individual creativity is most evident, but subject matter is often beyond their control. Many concept artists work in a studio or from home remotely as freelancers. Working for a studio has the advantage of an established salary. In the United States, the average annual gross salary for a concept artist in video game industry was $60,000-$70,000 a year in 2017. In 2024, entry level concept art positions ranged from $60,000-$95,000, with the average salary at about $112,000.

Digital media production, including the television and video game industries, has grown substantially in the 21st century. From 2009 to 2012, the value of the United States video game industry jumped from $19 million to $37 billion, and from 2008 to 2016, the value of the mobile game industry in China increased from 240 million yuan to 37.48 billion yuan. The need for concept artists in this rapidly growing industry has skyrocketed; 65% of the game development industry&#x27;s staff are artists. As such, there is a push for countries across the world to increase the availability of art education so that local artists have the skills to capitalize on the booming media industry. The art education community has made changes, offering new courses in art universities order better prepare students for the digital art field. Certain educators are pushing to move away from historic art education towards more standardized, industry-paced approaches that will better prepare students for this modern workforce. Other programs are pushing to create artist workshops in order to train artists in digital software.

==Materials==
Concept art has embraced the use of digital technology. Raster graphics editors for digital painting have become more easily available, as well as hardware such as graphics tablets, enabling more efficient working methods. Prior to this, any number of traditional mediums such as oil paints, acrylic paints, markers and pencils were used. Many modern paint packages are programmed to simulate the blending of color in the same way paint would blend on a canvas; proficiency with traditional media is often paramount to a concept artist&#x27;s ability to use painting software. Popular programs for concept artists include Photoshop and Corel Painter. Others include Manga Studio, Procreate and ArtRage. Most concept artists have switched to digital media because of ease of editing and speed. A lot of concept work has tight deadlines where a highly polished piece is needed in a short amount of time.

==Themes and styles==
Concept art has always had to cover many subjects, being the primary medium in film poster design since the early days of Hollywood, but the two most widely covered areas are science fiction and fantasy. Since the recent rise of its use in video game production, concept art has expanded to cover genres from fantasy to realistic depending on the final product.

Concept art ranges from stylized to photorealistic depending on the needs of the project. Artists working on a project often produce a large turnover in the early &#x27;blue sky&#x27; stage of production. This provides a broad range of interpretations, most being in the form of sketches, speed paints, and 3D overpaints. Later pieces, such as matte paintings, are produced as realistically as required. Concept artists will often have to adapt to the style of the studio they are hired for. The ability to produce multiple styles is valued in a concept artist.

==Specialization==
Concept art is a broad field, including specializations on a wide range of fictional and nonfiction subjects, such as character design, environment design, set design, and more industrial applications like retail design, architecture design, fashion design, and object design. Specialization is regarded as better for freelancers than concept artists who want to work in-house, where flexibility is key. Knowing the foundations of art, such as anatomy, perspective, color theory, design, and lighting are essential to all specializations.

<doc id="1056923" wikidata="Q57610" url="?curid=1056923" title="Wilm Hosenfeld">
<text>Wilhelm Adalbert Hosenfeld (; 2 May 189513 August 1952), originally a school teacher, was a German Army officer who by the end of the Second World War had risen to the rank of &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (captain). He helped to hide or rescue several Polish people, including Jews, in Nazi-German occupied Poland, and helped Jewish pianist and composer Władysław Szpilman to survive, hidden, in the ruins of Warsaw during the last months of 1944, an act which was portrayed in the 2002 film &quot;The Pianist&quot;. He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and died in Soviet captivity in 1952.

In October 2007, Hosenfeld was posthumously honoured by Lech Kaczyński, the President of Poland, with a Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In June 2009, Hosenfeld was posthumously recognized by Yad Vashem (Israel&#x27;s official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust) as one of the Righteous Among the Nations.

==Early life and World War I==

Hosenfeld was born into the family of a Roman Catholic schoolmaster living near Fulda. His family life had a Catholic character, and Christian charitable work was emphasised during his education. He was influenced by the Catholic Action and Church-inspired social work, and also by Prussian obedience, by German patriotism, and, during his marriage, by the increasing pacifism of his wife, Annemarie. He was also influenced by the &quot;Wandervogel&quot; movement (a German youth political group) and its adherents. From 1914, he saw active service in the First World War, and after being severely wounded in 1917, Hosenfeld received the Iron Cross Second Class.

==World War II==
Hosenfeld was drafted into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in August 1939 and was stationed in Poland from mid-September 1939 until his capture by the Soviet Army on 17 January 1945. His first destination in Poland was Pabianice, where he was involved in the building and running of a POW camp. Next, he was stationed in Węgrów in December 1939, where he remained until his battalion was moved another 30 km away to Jadów at the end of May 1940. He was finally transferred to Warsaw in July 1940, where he spent the rest of the war, for the most part, attached to &quot;Wachbataillon&quot; (guard battalion) 660, part of the &quot;Wach-Regiment Warschau&quot; (Warsaw Guard Regiment) in which he served as a staff officer and as the battalion sports officer. He was responsible for sports events at the Army Stadium in Warsaw.

A member of the Nazi Party since 1935, as time passed Hosenfeld grew disillusioned with the party and its policies, especially as he saw how Poles, and especially Jews, were treated. He and several fellow German Army officers felt sympathy for all peoples of occupied Poland. Ashamed of what some of their countrymen were doing, they offered help to those they could whenever possible.

Hosenfeld befriended numerous Poles and even made an effort to learn their language. He also attended Mass, received Holy Communion, and went to confession in Polish churches, even though this was forbidden. His actions on behalf of Poles began as early as autumn 1939, when against regulations he allowed Polish prisoners of war access to their families and even pushed successfully for the early release of at least one. 

During his time in Warsaw, Hosenfeld used his position to give refuge to people, regardless of their background, including at least one politically persecuted anti-Nazi ethnic German, who were in danger of persecution, even arrest by the Gestapo, sometimes by getting them the papers they needed and jobs at the sports stadium that was under his oversight. Beginning in August 1944, the pianist Władysław Szpilman was hiding out in an abandoned building at Aleja Niepodległości Street 223. In November, he was discovered there by Hosenfeld. To Szpilman&#x27;s surprise, the officer did not arrest or kill him; after discovering that the emaciated Szpilman was a pianist, Hosenfeld asked him to play something on the piano that was on the ground floor. Szpilman played Chopin&#x27;s Nocturne No. 20 in C♯ minor. After that, the officer brought him bread and jam on numerous occasions. He also offered Szpilman one of his coats to keep warm in the freezing temperatures.

Hosenfeld surrendered to the Soviets at Błonie, a small Polish city about 30 km west of Warsaw, with the men of a &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; company he was leading.

==Imprisonment and death==
In a 1946 letter to his wife in West Germany, Hosenfeld named the Jews who he had saved, and begged her to contact the Soviet authorities and ask them to arrange his release. He was transported to Minsk, and later to Bobrujsk on 22 July 1947, and later to Minsk again. He suffered a series of strokes during this time, and was placed in an infirmary.

In March 1950, Hosenfeld was sentenced to 25 years in prison, and perform hard labour, for alleged war crimes, solely on the account of being a German officer.

In 1950, Szpilman learned the name of the German officer who had offered him assistance in 1944–45. After much soul searching, Szpilman sought the intercession of a man who he privately considered &quot;a bastard&quot;, Jakub Berman, the head of the Polish secret police. Several days later, Berman paid a visit to Szpilman&#x27;s home and said that there was nothing he could do. He added, &quot;If your German were still in Poland, then we could get him out. But our comrades in the Soviet Union won&#x27;t let him go. They say your officer belonged to a detachment involved in spyingso there is nothing we can do about it as Poles, and I am powerless&quot;.

Szpilman never believed Berman&#x27;s claims of powerlessness. In an interview with Wolf Biermann, Szpilman described Berman as &quot;all powerful by the grace of Stalin,&quot; and lamented, &quot;So I approached the worst rogue of the lot, and it did no good.&quot; Both Warm and Szpilman petitoned Soviet authorities for his release, but they refused to believe he was not guilty of war crimes. Hosenfeld repeatedly failed to be extradited back to Poland, and he stayed as German prisoner-of-war in the Soviet Union for 7 years. Hosenfeld was transported, along with 250 other &quot;convicts&quot;, from Byelorussian SSR to Stalingrad in August 1950. His health rapidly deteriorated in Stalingrad, and unfortunately he spent his last months in a hospital, suffering from a series of strokes and severe chest injury, probably caused by physical torture. 

Soviet authorities believed Hosenfeld to be a SD unit member or involved in a detachment involved in spying, and ignored his statements that he gave aid to Poles and Jews, during WWII, and Hosenfeld probably suffered extensive physical torture during this time. His health was rapidly deteriorating in 1952, and Hosenfeld died that year in hospital, and his cadaver was buried in a nearby cemetery, probably specifically for Axis prisoners-of-war.

==Commemorations==
In 2002, &quot;The Pianist&quot;, a film based on Szpilman&#x27;s memoirs of the same name, portrayed Hosenfeld&#x27;s rescue of Władysław Szpilman. Hosenfeld was played by Thomas Kretschmann.

In October 2007, Hosenfeld was posthumously honoured by the president of Poland Lech Kaczyński with a Commander’s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta ().

Szpilman&#x27;s son, Andrzej Szpilman, had long called for Yad Vashem to recognize Hosenfeld as a Righteous Among the Nations, non-Jews who risked their lives to rescue Jews. On 25 November 2008, Yad Vashem posthumously recognised Hosenfeld as Righteous Among the Nations. On 19 June 2009, Israeli diplomats presented Hosenfeld&#x27;s son, Detlev, with the award, in Berlin.

On 4 December 2011, a commemorative plaque in Polish and English was unveiled at 223 Niepodległości Avenue in Warsaw, the place where Hosenfeld discovered Szpilman, in the presence of Hosenfeld&#x27;s daughter Jorinde.

<doc id="1056926" wikidata="Q1761283" url="?curid=1056926" title="Doctor Spectrum">
<text>Doctor Spectrum is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. There have been five versions of the character to date—three supervillains from the mainstream Marvel Universe belonging to the team Squadron Sinister (Earth-616) and two heroes from different alternate universes. The two heroes each belong to a version of the team Squadron Supreme, the Squadron Supreme of Earth-712 and the Squadron Supreme of Earth-31916 respectively). Doctor Spectrum is a pastiche of DC&#x27;s Green Lantern.

==Publication history==
===Squadron Sinister===
The first version of the character, Kinji Obatu, appears in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 (Oct. 1969), and is created by Roy Thomas and Sal Buscema. The story arc introduced the supervillain team the Squadron Sinister, whose four members were loosely based on heroes in DC Comics&#x27; Justice League of America, with Doctor Spectrum based on Green Lantern.

The Grandmaster assembled the Squadron Sinister to battle the champions of the time-traveling Kang—the superhero team the Avengers. Doctor Spectrum battles the Avenger Iron Man, and is defeated when the hero deduces that the villain&#x27;s Power Prism (a sentient entity called Krimonn) is vulnerable to ultra-violet light. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron and are abandoned by the Grandmaster. Doctor Spectrum reappears in the title &quot;Iron Man&quot; and after a series of battles is defeated when Iron Man crushes the Power Prism. A powerless Obatu is arrested and deported back to his native Uganda. During a subsequent battle with The Thing, Black Panther and Brother Voodoo, Obatu accidentally falls to his death.

Unknown to Iron Man, the Power Prism reforms and is found by a sanitation worker. They bring it to evangelist Billy Roberts, who becomes the second Doctor Spectrum.

The Squadron reappear in the title Defenders, reunited by the alien Nebulon (although the team is unaware of the fact that this is a new Doctor Spectrum). The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the Arctic to melt the polar ice caps, thereby covering Earth in water. The superhero team the Defenders prevent the scheme and defeat the Squadron (and Nebulon), with Doctor Strange defeating Doctor Spectrum. After this defeat Doctor Spectrum and his two remaining teammates are teleported off world by Nebulon, returning with an energy-draining weapon. The Squadron Sinister plan to threaten the Earth again but are defeated once again by the Defenders and the Avenger Yellowjacket.

The Power Prism is kept by Yellowjacket, who modifies it and give sit to his wife Janet van Dyne (the Wasp) as a gift. Krimonn, the entity within the Power Prism, possesses Jan and transforms her into a villainous female Doctor Spectrum, who battles several Avengers but is then defeated by the Vision&#x27;s use of the Prism&#x27;s ultraviolet weakness. The prism itself bonds to the Wasp in an attempt to save itself, but is eventually removed by Billy Roberts after he is located by the Avengers. Roberts becomes Doctor Spectrum once more, although on this occasion the Power Prism is in control and seeks to bond with the most powerful Avenger, the Thunder God Thor. The Power Prism succeeds in taking Thor as a host, infecting Mjolnir to use as a focal point to control him and defeat the other Avengers, but fails to take into account that to wield Mjolnir, Thor must be &quot;worthy&quot;. No longer worthy to wield the hammer due to him being tainted by the gem, Thor drops Mjolnir and reverts to his mortal alter-ego Donald Blake during a fight with Iron Man, which results in the Power Prism losing control and becoming inert.

The Grandmaster later reforms the Squadron Sinister, bringing in Henry Pym&#x27;s former lab assistant Alice Nugent to be the new Doctor Spectrum. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the &quot;Wellspring of Power&quot;—an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities—the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister&#x27;s powers and they battle the New Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts leader Baron Zemo defeats the Grandmaster, and in the ensuing chaos, the Squadron escapes.

===Squadron Supreme===
Roy Thomas and penciller John Buscema created an alternate-universe team of heroes called the Squadron Supreme, who debut in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85 (February 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat. The characters (including Doctor Spectrum) were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel&#x27;s production department, as the covers of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) advertised appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues.

The Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the Serpent Cartel, but eventually team together and prevent the use of the Serpent Crown. The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title &quot;Thor&quot;, when the evil version of Hyperion attacks the Earth-712 version and then Thunder God Thor. The Squadron are mind-controlled by the entities the Overmind and Null the Living Darkness, but are freed by the Defenders and aid the heroes in defeating the villains.

The character features with the Squadron Supreme in a self-titled 12-issue miniseries (Sept. 1985–Aug. 1986) by writer Mark Gruenwald. Gruenwald revealed each member&#x27;s origin, with Joseph Ledger being a former astronaut who saves a Skrull in space. The grateful Skrull, called the Skrullian Skymaster, rewards Ledger with the Power Prism. The series also explains why the Squadrons Sinister and Supreme are similar: the Grandmaster creates the Squadron Sinister modelled on the already-existing Squadron Supreme of the Earth-712 universe. Gruenwald, Ryan, and inker Al Williamson created a graphic-novel sequel which maroons the team in the mainstream Marvel universe. Doctor Spectrum and teammates encounter the hero Quasar, and relocate to the government facility Project Pegasus. After another encounter with the Overmind and a visit to the Stranger, the group attempts to return to their universe, and battles the entity Deathurge.

The entire Squadron Supreme appear in a two-part story with the Avengers that returns them to their home universe, where they disband for a time. Doctor Spectrum rejoins his teammates to aid the interdimensional team the Exiles.

===Supreme Power===
The mature-audience Marvel MAX imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Squadron Supreme. The title &quot;Supreme Power&quot; relates how Joseph Ledger, a soldier in the United States Army, accidentally bonds with a crystal found in the vessel that brings Hyperion to Earth. The story continues in the limited series &quot;Doctor Spectrum&quot;, written by Sara Barnes and art by John Dell and Travel Foreman, with the experience placing Ledger in a coma, and after reliving his life in his mind for the benefit of the apparently sentient crystal, the character awakens and adopts the codename of Doctor Spectrum. Operating in a military-style uniform as opposed to a prismatic costume, Doctor Spectrum encounters and battles Hyperion, forming a truce with him to hunt down super-powered serial killer Michael Redstone. Doctor Spectrum also begins a tentative romance with fellow superhuman Amphibian. Both eventually join the US-backed Squadron Supreme in the 2006 title of the same name. Joseph is later killed during a battle with a version of the Squadron Sinister. The Squadron Sinister&#x27;s Nighthawk is later seen examining the crystal embedded in his corpse.

===Squadron Supreme of America===
A variation of the Joseph Ledger version of Doctor Spectrum appears as a member of the Squadron Supreme of America. This version is a simulacrum created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite. In his personal time, he works as a colonel in the United States Air Force.

In the team&#x27;s first mission, Doctor Spectrum led the Squadron Supreme of America in fighting Namor and the Defenders of the Deep, when they targeted a Roxxon oil platform off the coast of Alaska.

Then, the Squadron Supreme of America visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, where Doctor Spectrum used his powers to melt areas of the oil rig to secure it from an attack by Namor. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.

In &quot;The War of the Realms&quot;, Joseph was at his desk until he and the other members of the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C., where Phil Coulson brought them up to speed with Malekith the Accursed&#x27;s invasion. Doctor Spectrum leads the Squadron Supreme of America in fighting an army of Rock Trolls and Frost Giants. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio, which has become a battleground.

Doctor Spectrum led the Squadron Supreme in an attempt to apprehend Black Panther, when he infiltrated the Pentagon to confront Phil Coulson.

==Powers and abilities==
All versions of Doctor Spectrum derive their abilities from an alien gem called the Power Prism. The original prism, used by the Kenji Obatu and Billy Roberts incarnations of Doctor Spectrum, is a sentient being called Krimonn. Krimonn was originally a Skrull who was transformed into a living prism as punishment after a failed attempt to overthrow the Skrull emperor. When the Grandmaster requires champions to battle the Avengers, he retrieves the prism and grants Krimonn several energy-based powers that can be used in conjunction with a host. Kenji Obatu is the first to coin the term &quot;Power Prism&quot;, and discovers that although trapped in prism form, Krimonn remains aggressive and asserts his will via telepathy. Krimonn&#x27;s mind is &quot;muted&quot; by Nebulon when the Power Prism is given to Billy Roberts, although Krimonn reasserts itself during the quest to find and bond with the character Thor. When the plan fails and the gem is shattered, Krimonn&#x27;s consciousness apparently dissipated forever.

Krimonn could bestow on a host the ability to project and manipulate light energy in various colors; create light energy constructs of various shapes, sizes and colors; flight; protection from the rigors of space and the ability to become intangible. The Power Prism is vulnerable to ultra-violet light.

The Earth-712 Doctor Spectrum gains his power the Skrullian Power Prism given to him by the Skrullian Skymaster. When the Power Prism later exploded and fragments of it were embedded in Doctor Spectrum, his skin, hair, and costume were bleached chalk-white. The Earth-712 Power Prism possesses the same abilities as the Earth-616 version.

The Earth-31916 Power Prism is a sentient power source removed from the spacecraft that brings Hyperion to Earth.

==Other versions==
===Secret Wars (2015)===
An alternate version of the original Doctor Spectrum later appears on Battleworld. This version of the character is Japanese rather than Ugandan.

===Great Society (Earth-4290001)/Squadron Supreme (Earth-616)===
An alternate, female version of Doctor Spectrum appears as a member of the Great Society, a team of Justice League analogues from Earth-4290001. After the Illiuminati destroy their Earth to stop the Incursion, she is marooned in Marvel&#x27;s mainstream reality after Secret Wars ends, then becomes a member of the Earth-616 Squadron Supreme, composed of members from numerous realities.

==In other media==
The Billy Roberts incarnation of Doctor Spectrum appears in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, voiced by Phil LaMarr. This version is an alien and a member of the Squadron Supreme who was forced to destroy his home planet by the other Squadron members and was subsequently controlled by the Power Prism. After the Avengers free him, Roberts joins a S.H.I.E.L.D. space program to find a new planet to reside on while the Prism forms a separate body and reunites with the Squadron. Ultimately, Ant-Man stops the Prism and Captain America uses it to depower Hyperion by manipulating the Sun&#x27;s rays.

<text>Xiao He (257 BC – 16 August 193 BC) was a Chinese calligrapher and politician of the early Western Han dynasty. He served Liu Bang (Emperor Gao), the founder of the Han dynasty, during the insurrection against the Qin dynasty, and fought on Liu&#x27;s side in the Chu–Han Contention against Liu&#x27;s rival, Xiang Yu. After the founding of the Han dynasty, Xiao He became the chancellor and held office until his death. For his contributions, he is also known as one of the &quot;Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty&quot; (), along with Han Xin and Zhang Liang.

==Early life==
Xiao He was born in Fengyi County, Sishui Commandery (present-day Feng County, Jiangsu). In his early days, he served as a &quot;gongcao&quot; (功曹; magistrate&#x27;s secretary) in the administrative office of Pei County. He was studious, tactful and amiable. He was well versed in law and had a wide network of friends and acquaintances, among whom include Liu Bang, Cao Shen, Fan Kuai, Xiahou Ying and Zhou Bo.

==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==
Once, Liu Bang released some prisoners he was escorting to Mount Li to be labourers, and became a fugitive. He hid in an outlaw stronghold on Mount Mangdang (in present-day Yongcheng, Henan) and maintained secret contact with Xiao He and Cao Shen. In 209 BC, Chen Sheng and Wu Guang started the Dazexiang Uprising to overthrow the Qin dynasty, and was followed by numerous other rebellions throughout China. The magistrate of Pei County considered rebelling as well, so he heeded Xiao He and Cao Shen&#x27;s advice to invite Liu Bang back to support him. However, he changed his mind later and denied Liu Bang&#x27;s party entry into the city. As he was afraid that Xiao He and Cao Shen might open the gates for Liu Bang, he intended to have them executed, but Xiao and Cao escaped and joined Liu. As suggested by Xiao He, Liu Bang had letters sent to the townsfolk, fired into the city on arrows, urging them to join him. The people responded to Liu Bang&#x27;s call and killed the magistrate and welcomed him back into the city.

After returning to Pei County, the townsfolk wanted Liu Bang to lead them to overthrow the Qin dynasty. However, Liu Bang expressed reluctance in taking up the leadership position and the people agreed to decide their leader by luck. Xiao He was in charge of the process and he had the names of ten respectable men in town, including Liu Bang, written on separate pieces of paper and shuffled. Xiao He then asked Liu Bang to pick any piece from the pile, without seeing the name on it, and Liu picked his own name by chance. Liu Bang looked at Xiao He and wanted to decline again. Xiao He immediately grabbed the remaining pieces of paper, put them into his mouth and chewed them to shreds, after which he proclaimed Liu Bang as their leader. Liu Bang became known as the &quot;Duke of Pei&quot; and built his rebel army in Pei County, with Xiao He and his friends supporting him. Liu Bang learnt from Xiao He later that actually all the ten pieces of paper contained his name, and Xiao had deliberately tampered with the system to help him.

In 206 BC, the Qin dynasty collapsed after the last Qin ruler, Ziying, surrendered to Liu Bang. Liu Bang&#x27;s army occupied the Qin capital Xianyang. Upon entering the Epang Palace, Liu Bang and most of his men seized treasures and women for themselves, while Xiao He rushed to the chancellor&#x27;s office and ordered it to be heavily guarded. Xiao He then brought a few men with him to collect all official documents in the office and bring them out safely. Xiao He later explained that the documents were more valuable than riches and women, because they contained crucial information about the Qin Empire and would be useful in intelligence.

==Chu–Han Contention==
===Recommending Han Xin===
Liu Bang was forced to retreat from Xianyang later as Xiang Yu&#x27;s army arrived and occupied the city. After plundering Xianyang and destroying the palace, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Liu Bang received the title of &quot;King of Han&quot; and was relocated to the remote Bashu region (in present-day Sichuan), with Xiao He and his followers accompanying him. Liu Bang was unhappy and wanted to attack Xiang Yu because the land of Guanzhong rightfully belonged to him, according to an earlier promise by Emperor Yi of Chu, but was granted by Xiang to three surrendered Qin generals instead. However, Xiao He and others managed to persuade Liu Bang to temporarily remain in Bashu and build up his forces in preparation for a battle for supremacy with Xiang Yu later. Xiao He was appointed by Liu Bang as the chancellor of the Han kingdom.

During that time, Xiao He met Han Xin, who had recently joined Liu Bang&#x27;s army and was serving as a low-ranking soldier, and recognised Han Xin&#x27;s brilliance in military strategy. Not long later, many of Liu Bang&#x27;s men deserted as they were unable to cope with living in remote Bashu, and Han Xin also left as he was disappointed because he felt his talent would go to waste in Liu Bang&#x27;s camp. When Xiao He learnt that Han Xin had left, he immediately rushed to find Han and bring him back, without managing to inform Liu Bang in time. Xiao He caught up with Han Xin after trailing him for a few days, even at night, and succeeded in persuading Han to return. Meanwhile, Liu Bang thought that Xiao He had also deserted him and was shocked, but was relieved when he saw Xiao returning with Han Xin days later. Liu Bang asked Xiao He, &quot;Of all those who deserted, why did you choose to bring back Han Xin only?&quot; Xiao He then strongly recommended Han Xin to Liu Bang, saying that Han&#x27;s talent was unmatched. Liu Bang heeded Xiao He&#x27;s suggestion and appointed Han Xin as Grand Marshal commanding the Han armies.

===Conquest of the Three Qin===
In 206 BC, Liu Bang conquered the Three Qins and left Xiao He in charge of Guanzhong and Bashu, while he led his army eastward to attack Xiang Yu&#x27;s Western Chu kingdom. Xiao He governed those territories effectively and provided support to Liu Bang&#x27;s army at the warfront in the form of supplies, provisions and reinforcements. While in Guanzhong, Xiao He restored peace and order by implementing a new system of governance and reconstructing destroyed buildings. Under the new system, taxes were readjusted to reduce the burden on the poor; land that used to belong to the Qin aristocracy was redistributed to peasants, in order to increase agricultural output; capable and respectable men were selected from among commoners to assist government officials in administration.

===Battle of Gaixia===
Liu Bang eventually defeated Xiang Yu at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC and unified China under his rule. He was proclaimed &quot;Emperor&quot; and became historically known as &quot;Emperor Gaozu of Han&quot;. The following year, when Gaozu rewarded his subjects according to their contributions, Xiao He received the title of &quot;Marquis of Zan&quot; () in addition to his appointment as chancellor. Besides, Gaozu also granted Xiao He a rare special privilege: Xiao was allowed to enter the imperial court carrying a sword and with his shoes on, and not required to walk in briskly while others had to.

==In service during the Western Han dynasty==
In 201 BC, Emperor Gaozu wanted to build his capital in Luoyang but Zhang Liang suggested Xianyang instead, because it was surrounded by natural defences such as mountain passes, and had fertile land for agriculture. Gaozu put Xiao He in charge of the constructions in Xianyang. Two years later, the project was completed and Xiao He took Gaozu on a tour of Xianyang. The new palace was called Weiyang Palace and served as the central imperial palace throughout the Western Han dynasty and Xin dynasty. Gaozu also renamed Xianyang to &quot;Chang&#x27;an&quot;, which meant &quot;long-lasting peace&quot;.

===Role in Han Xin&#x27;s downfall===
In 196 BC, while Gaozu was away on a military campaign to suppress a rebellion by Chen Xi, one of Han Xin&#x27;s servants reported to Empress Lü Zhi that his master was involved in a conspiracy with Chen Xi and was planning a coup in Chang&#x27;an. Empress Lü approached Xiao He for help and they formulated a plan to lure Han Xin into a trap. Xiao He had an imperial edict sent to Han Xin, announcing news of Gaozu&#x27;s victory over Chen Xi, asking Han to meet the emperor and offer his congratulations. As soon as Han Xin arrived in Changle Palace, he was arrested and executed in a torturous manner for alleged treason.

===Later life and death===
In 195 BC, Xiao He saw that Chang&#x27;an was becoming more congested and the imperial garden was full of uncultivated land, hence he suggested to Gaozu to carve out parts of the garden and grant them to peasants as farmland. Gaozu was unhappy and accused Xiao He of accepting bribes and dishonouring imperial authority. Xiao He was arrested and imprisoned, but was released later after Gaozu was convinced that Xiao He had the people&#x27;s interests at heart. Gaozu summoned Xiao He to see him and he said with jest and embarrassment, &quot;The chancellor was asking for the fields in the imperial garden out of interest for the people, but I did not approve. This showed that I&#x27;m only like Jie and Zhou (Emperors of the Xia and Shang dynasties), and that you&#x27;re the most understanding chancellor. Therefore, I intentionally imprisoned you to show the people that I&#x27;m a tyrant.&quot;

After the death of Gaozu, Xiao He continued serving Gaozu&#x27;s successor Emperor Hui as chancellor until he died in 193 BC. Before his death, Xiao He recommended Cao Shen to succeed him. Cao Shen inherited the system of governance left behind by Xiao He and maintained it well but did not implement any new changes.

==Descendants==
Xiao He&#x27;s great-grandson, Xiao Biao (), moved to Lanling (near present-day Zaozhuang, Shandong) and led a reclusive life there.

Two of his descendants would later found imperial dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. Xiao Daocheng would found the Southern Qi, while his distant cousin Xiao Yan would found the subsequent Liang dynasty.

==Legacy==
Some Chinese idioms and sayings originated from the events in Xiao He&#x27;s life and are listed as follows:

*&quot;Xiao He chases Han Xin under the moonlight&quot; (): Originated from the event where Xiao trailed Han Xin for a few days, even at night, in order to catch up with the latter and bring him back to Liu Bang. It is used to describe an urgent situation in which action has to be taken immediately without notification.
*&quot;Success is due to Xiao He, downfall is also due to Xiao He&quot; (成也蕭何 敗也蕭何 Hangul: 성야소하 폐야소하): Xiao He helped Han Xin become a general, which enabled Han to put his talent to good use. However, Xiao also played an important role in Han&#x27;s death. It is used to describe a situation where one&#x27;s success and failure are both due to the same factor.
*&quot;Cao following Xiao&#x27;s rules&quot; (): Cao Shen, Xiao He&#x27;s successor as chancellor, inherited the system of governance left behind by Xiao and maintained it well but did not implement any new changes. It is used to describe the continuation of the work of one&#x27;s predecessor.

==Modern references==
Xiao He is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI&quot; by Koei. He also appears as a non-playable character in the action RPG &quot;Prince of Qin&quot;.

<text>Sir George Rostrevor Hamilton FRSL (1888 - 1967) was an English poet and critic. He worked as a civil servant and Special Commissioner. He was knighted in the 1951 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

He had a classical education at the University of Oxford, and later compiled anthologies of Latin and Greek verse for Nonesuch Press. He was a published war poet of World War I, known for &quot;A Cross in Flanders&quot;.

His book &quot;The Tell-Tale Article&quot; on the Auden Group made an impact by the expedient of counting the proportion of definite articles in Auden&#x27;s verse, remarking that it was much higher than in older styles. In general he was a steady conservative in matters of literature.

He was a director of the Poetry Book Society, Vice-President of the Royal Society of Literature, and well connected as a correspondent of many literary and philosophical figures; including Walter de la Mare, C. S. Lewis, Wilfrid Meynell, Roy Fuller, Henri Bergson, E. R. Eddison and Owen Barfield.

<text>The Canberra Nature Park is a series of 33 separate protected areas in and around Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, ranging from bushland hills to lowland native grassland. Many of the areas have previously been cleared for grazing, but many are now being returned to native bushland through revegetation and rehabilitation programs.

Canberra&#x27;s inner hills Black Mountain, Mount Ainslie, Mount Majura, Mount Pleasant, Russell Hill, Red Hill, Mount Mugga, O&#x27;Connor Ridge, Bruce Ridge, Aranda Bushland, Mount Painter, The Pinnacle, Lyneham Ridge, Oakey Hill, Mount Taylor, Isaacs Ridge, Mount Stromlo, Mount Arawang, Neighbour Hill, Wanniassa Hill, and Narrabundah Hill are protected from development by the National Capital Plan and almost all are now part of the Canberra Nature Park system. These hills provide a scenic backdrop and natural setting for Canberra&#x27;s urban areas, as originally set out in the Walter Burley Griffin Plan.

Most people in Canberra live within easy walking distance of a Canberra Nature Park area.

The areas are typically enclosed by simple wire fences, or by house fences. Gates are provided for people to walk or run in the parks; motorbikes are excluded. Some parks with mountains have reservoirs, as part of Icon Water&#x27;s supply network.

<doc id="1056933" wikidata="Q2320075" url="?curid=1056933" title="Langkasuka">
<text>Langkasuka was an ancient Malay Hindu-Buddhist kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula (in modern-day Thailand). Langkasuka flourished from the 2nd century to the 15th century as the oldest kingdom in the Malay Peninsula, believed to have been established by descendants of Ashoka the Great. The name is Sanskrit in origin; it is thought to be a combination of &quot;langkha&quot; for &quot;resplendent land&quot; -&quot;sukkha&quot; for &quot;bliss&quot;. The kingdom, along with Old Kedah, is among the earliest kingdoms founded on the Malay Peninsula. The exact location of the kingdom is of some debate, but archaeological discoveries at Yarang near Pattani, Thailand suggest a probable location. The kingdom is proposed to have been established in the 1st century, perhaps between 80 and 100 AD.

According to the legend given in the &quot;Kedah Annals&quot;, the kingdom was founded and named by Merong Mahawangsa. Another proposal suggests that the name may have been derived from &quot;langkha&quot; and Ashoka, the Mauryan Hindu warrior king who eventually became a pacifist after embracing the ideals espoused in Buddhism, and that the early Indian colonizers of the Malayic Isthmus named the kingdom Langkasuka in his honour. Chinese historical sources provided some information on the kingdom and recorded a king Bhagadatta who sent envoys to the Chinese court.

==Historical records ==
The earliest and most detailed description of the kingdom comes from the Chinese Liang dynasty (502–557) record &quot;Liangshu&quot;, which refers to the kingdom of &quot;Lang-ya-xiu&quot; (, Middle Chinese: ). The record mentions that the kingdom was founded over 400 years earlier, which made its founding likely in the 2nd century AD. According to &quot;Liangshu&quot;, &quot;Lang-ya-xiu&quot; or Langkasuka was 30 days&#x27; journey from east to west, and 20 from north to south, 24,000 &quot;li&quot; in distance from Guangzhou. It mentions that Aloeswood (&quot;Aquilaria&quot;) and camphor were abundant in the kingdom, and its capital was described as being surrounded by walls to form a city with double gates, towers and pavilions. Both men and women in Langkasuka wore sarongs with their torsos bare and their hair loose, although the king and senior officials covered their shoulders with cloth and wore gold earrings and belts of gold cord. Women of high status wrapped themselves in cloth and wore jeweled girdles. It gives further information on some of its kings and also relates a story on a succession:


This king then ruled for more than 20 years. He was succeeded by his son, King Bhagadatta, who sent the first ambassadorial mission to China in 515. Further emissaries were sent in 523, 531, and 568.
The transcription of the kingdom&#x27;s name in Chinese records changed over time. In the late seventh century, the Buddhist monk Yi Jing mentioned encountering three Chinese monks who lived in a place named &quot;Lang-jia-shu&quot; (郎伽戍).

A Song dynasty work &quot;Zhu fan zhi&quot; (published in 1225) gives a description of the country of Ling-ya-si-jia (凌牙斯加). It mentions that its people cut their hair and wrapped themselves in a piece of cloth, its products included elephant tusks, rhinoceros horns, types of wood and camphor, and their merchants traded in wine, rice, silk and porcelain. It also says that the country paid tribute to a country named Sanfoqi, which is usually interpreted to be Srivijaya.

Langkasuka was known as &quot;Long-ya-xi-jiao&quot; (龍牙犀角) in &quot;Daoyi Zhilüe&quot; from the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368); and &quot;Lang-xi-jia&quot; (狼西加) during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), as marked in Admiral Zheng He&#x27;s Mao Kun map. &quot;Daoyi Zhilüe&quot; mentions that the natives of Langkasuka made salt from seawater and ferment rice wine, and produced hornbill casques, lakawood, honey and gharuwood. The people wore cotton from the Philippines and printed cloth from India and local sources.

&quot;Langkasuka&quot; was mentioned in the Malay text &quot;Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa&quot;, and it was referred to as &quot;Lengkasuka&quot; in the Javanese poem &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot;. Tamil sources name &quot;Ilangasoka&quot; as one of Rajendra Chola&#x27;s conquests in his expedition against the Srivijaya empire. It was described as a kingdom that was &quot;undaunted in fierce battles&quot;. Thai sources made no reference to Langkasuka, but Pattani was identified as one of the twelve Naksat cities under the influence of Nakhon Si Thammarat in Thai chronicles.

===Outline of Langkasuka&#x27;s history===
A brief outline of the history of Langkasuka can be determined from the limited historical records available. The kingdom is thought to have been founded some time early in the 2nd century AD. It then underwent a period of decline due to the expansion of Funan in the early 3rd century. In the 6th century it experienced a resurgence and began to send emissaries to China. King Bhagadatta first established relations with China in 515 AD, with further emissaries sent in 523, 531 and 568. By the 8th century it had probably come under the control of the rising Srivijaya empire. In 1025 it was attacked by the armies of King Rajendra Chola I in his campaign against Srivijaya. In the 12th century, Langkasuka was a tributary to Srivijaya. The kingdom declined and how it ended is unclear with several theories being put up.

The &quot;Pasai Annals&quot; mentioned that Langkasuka was destroyed around 1370. Some believed that Langkasuka remained under the control and influence of the Srivijaya Empire until the 14th century when it was conquered by the Majapahit Empire. Langkasuka was probably conquered by Pattani as it ceased to exist by the 15th-century. Several historians contest this and believe that Langkasuka survived up to the 1470s. The areas of the kingdom that were not under the direct rule of Pattani is thought to have embraced Islam along with Kedah in 1474.

==Location==

Chinese and Arab sources placed the ancient kingdom on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. The &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; mentions that Langkasuka bordered Pan Pan, and a map in the Ming dynasty military treatise &quot;Wubei Zhi&quot; locates it south of Songkla near the Pattani River. A 15th century Arab text similarly places the kingdom between Kelantan and Songkla. The only contradictory information comes from a later Malay text &quot;Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa&quot; which placed it on the west coast as the predecessor of modern Kedah, although its sovereign had some association with Pattani. Chinese, Arab and Indian sources all considered Kedah and Langkasuka to be separate geographical entities. The Javanese poem &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; placed it north of Saiburi, however it appears to imply that it was originally located on the west coast but was transferred later to the east.

In 1961, taking account of the various sources, the geographer and historian Paul Wheatley concluded that Langkasuka should be located near the modern town of Pattani. French archaeologist and historian Michel Jacq-Hergoualc&#x27;h concurred, and proposed the former estuary of the Pattani River near Yarang as the likely location of Langkasuka. He also suggested that whole area between Pattani, Saiburi and Yala may have been part of Langkasuka. Modern archaeological explorations have uncovered ruins near Yarang, a village fifteen kilometers south of Pattani, which may be of the city described in &quot;Liangshu&quot;. The city was located inland 10 miles from the coast and connected to the rivers leading to the sea via canals. Silting of the waterways may have led to its decline.

==Archaeology==

Several archaeological expeditions were conducted in the 1960s to locate Langkasuka following Paul Wheatley&#x27;s suggestion of its likely location. In 1963, Stewart Wavell led a Cambridge expedition to locate Langkasuka and Tambralinga, the details of this expedition are described in &quot;The Naga King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

An archaeological investigation of the Yarang area began in 1989 by the Fine Arts Department of Thailand. The majority of the ruins were clustered in the vicinity of a hamlet called Ban Wat, and may have formed the nucleus of the city. Others were scattered further to the North at Ban Jalæ, and a couple more at Ban Prawæ. The excavations found various Buddhist structures and objects including votive tablets and sculptures, indicating a strong Buddhist presence in the kingdom. Objects related to Hindu worship were also found.

Many Chinese and Arab coins made of bronze have been found in the region, an indication of the commercial activity of the kingdom. Two silver Sassanid coins have also been found.

<text>Venissa (Gwenissa, Genissa, Genvissa, Genuissa), according to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s 12th century &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, was a daughter of the Roman Emperor Claudius, whom he gave in marriage to the British king Arvirargus once he had submitted to Rome.

According to Geoffrey&#x27;s account she was very beautiful, and so enchanted Arvirargus that he preferred her company to anyone else&#x27;s. He founded Gloucester, supposedly named after Claudius, in her honour. When Arvirargus fell out with Rome and Vespasian was sent to enforce a reconciliation, Venissa acted as mediator between them.

Venissa cannot be considered historical. She is not mentioned in authentic Roman history; her supposed husband Arvirargus is known only from a cryptic reference in a 2nd-century satirical poem by Juvenal; and it is in any case inconceivable that a daughter, even an illegitimate daughter, of a Roman emperor could be given in marriage to a barbarian without attracting comment. Nonetheless, she and her husband, identified with the historical Caratacus, appear in many uncritical genealogies originating in the Tudor period.

<doc id="1056946" wikidata="Q7599639" url="?curid=1056946" title="Stanley Graham">
<text>Eric Stanley George Graham (12 November 1900 – 21 October 1941) was a New Zealander who killed seven people.

==Early life==
Graham was born and raised in Kokatahi, New Zealand and, as a child, worked at the Longford Hotel, built in 1902, ten miles from Hokitika, whose proprietor was his father, John Graham. Graham met his wife, Dorothy McCoy, when she moved from Rakaia in the late 1920s to work at the hotel.

They married in Christchurch on 22 December 1930, living there for six months before moving to run a small dairy farm at Kowhitirangi on the West Coast. They were to have a son and a daughter.

Through the late 1930s, Graham maintained reasonably good relations with his neighbours, although he and his wife took little part in social life. By 1940, though, the Graham family was under severe financial pressure, having had cream condemned by the Westland Co-operative Dairy Company and incurred debt from a venture into cattle breeding. As income from his farm dropped, he fell into debt totalling more than £550 (). His behaviour took a turn for the worse, and he began threatening and abusing passing neighbours. Graham and his wife practised target shooting from the back of their home in the middle of the night. Graham was an expert marksman and had an assortment of firearms.

In early 1941, Graham was in a dispute with the police, who wanted his .303 rifle for war use. This was finally handed over on 15 July, but Graham and his wife still held a shotgun and two Winchester rifles, a .22 and a .405.

On 11 September, at Ashby Bergh&#x27;s department store at High Street in central Christchurch, Mrs. Graham purchased, on her husband&#x27;s behalf, a 7mm Mauser rifle and ammunition. This was the weapon Graham used to shoot his victims.

==Day of the rampage==

On 4 October 1941, a neighbour of Graham&#x27;s, Anker Madsen, complained to Constable Edward Best, stationed in nearby Kaniere, that Graham was accusing him of poisoning his cattle. Best decided not to respond in order to give Graham time to calm down.

On 8 October, Graham confronted Madsen with a rifle. Later that morning, Best attempted to discuss the matter with Graham but backed off after Graham pointed two rifles out of a window at him. Best retreated to Hokitika for back-up and returned to the farm with Sergeant William Cooper, 43, and Constables Frederick Jordan, 26, and Percy Tulloch, 35. After a short conversation inside his house, Graham shot and wounded Sergeant Cooper and Constable Best after Sergeant Cooper apparently reached to disarm Graham. He then fired at Constables Jordan and Tulloch as they ran into the house, killing them both instantly with the one bullet. When the badly wounded Cooper attempted to leave to obtain help, Graham shot him dead on the path in front of the house. Best was shot once more after allegedly attempting to plead with him, and died three days later. Graham also fatally wounded a field instructor for the Canterbury education board named George Ridley, who had entered Graham&#x27;s property to assist any wounded along with an armed local, whom Graham threatened and disarmed.

Graham then fled his house, armed with both of his Winchester rifles, his 7mm Mauser Rifle, the .303 rifle taken from the local who had accompanied George Ridley into Graham&#x27;s property, and a .32 ACP Colt Revolver stolen from Sergeant Cooper&#x27;s body.

==Manhunt and death==
Returning the next evening to discover three members of the Home Guard in his house, Graham opened fire and killed home guardsmen Richard &quot;Maxie&quot; Coulson and Gregory Hutchison in a gunfight. During that engagement, he was wounded in the right shoulder.

The ensuing manhunt was the biggest in New Zealand history. It was overseen by Commissioner of Police Denis Cummings. More than 100 New Zealand Police and several hundred New Zealand Army and Home Guard personnel searched the area for Graham for 12 days, with orders to shoot on sight if they found Graham armed.

On 10 October, both of Graham&#x27;s Winchester rifles and 800 rounds of ammunition were discovered. Blood was discovered on one of the rifles, suggesting he had been wounded.

In the next few days, Graham&#x27;s blood-soaked shirt and the .303 rifle he had stolen earlier were recovered, and after 9 October, he was sighted numerous times by home guardsmen and civilians and, on at least three occasions, was fired upon whilst attempting to return to his home or simply walking in its vicinity. On at least two occasions, cattle on nearby farms were found slashed or shot, and on at least one occasion, a dead heifer was found with meat taken from it.

On 17 October, a farmhouse belonging to Henry Growcott, a childhood friend of Graham&#x27;s, was broken into and food was taken.

On 20 October, parties of police were positioned around his home, expecting Graham to return to the Growcott farm. In the middle of the night, after being spotted by two police constables and a local civilian carrying his rifle and ammunition belts, an injured Graham was shot by Auckland Constable James D&#x27;Arcy Quirke with a .303 rifle from a distance of 25 metres as he crawled through a patch of scrub. After being shot, he was surrounded by almost a hundred police and army personnel, reportedly telling one of them that he &quot;could have shot some more&quot;. He died the following morning at approximately 5:25 a.m. at Westland Hospital, Hokitika, the same hospital where Constable Best had died from his injuries. He was buried at Hokitika Cemetery. Constable Quirke reported that Graham told him he was intending to give up that night.

Later that month, the Graham property was burnt to the ground and Mrs Graham and her children left the area.

==In popular culture==
There have been several biographical accounts of his life and the murders published since the tragedies occurred.

In 1968, the Australian drama series &quot;Homicide&quot; based episode 180, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, on the case, with the Graham character being played by Brian Wenzel. Unlike real life, the Graham character is captured alive, with the detectives wondering at the end of the episode whether he would be found insane or sentenced to death.

In 1974, Nightwood Films produced a 26-minute documentary concerning the manhunt. This film is the only audio-visual record of many of the participants&#x27; recollections. It was also the first time the large cache of photographs taken during the manhunt by Home Guardsman Dave Stevenson were made public.

A 1981 British-New Zealand film, &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, was made about Stanley Graham and his chain of killings, as well as the dimensions of historical context and social injustice involved. Australian actor Jack Thompson played Graham.

<doc id="1056951" wikidata="Q1181708" url="?curid=1056951" title="Decamentathlon">
<text>The Decamentathlon is a multi disciplined games event that was created as part of the first Mind Sports Olympiad. It was founded to try to find the best games all-rounder in the world and hence possibly the best games player. It was given a prize fund of £10,000 for the inaugural competition, that equalled
that of the highest funded event at the first MSO sponsored by Skandia. However, the other events were spread over multiple playing sessions whereas the Decamentathlon was held over just a single session. This event was initially hailed as the MSO flagship event. Although, the Mind Sports Olympiad&#x27;s other new event the Pentamind has since become regarded as the more significant event despite not having a fixed format.

== Format ==
The Mind Sports Olympiad was described as the Olympics of the mind. The Decamentathlon and Pentamind were an attempt to replicate the ideas of the decathlon and pentathlon from athletics.
Unlike the Pentamind which has a free format allowing competitors to use different events to each other, the Decamentathlon has a fixed format. The Decamentathlon comprises
a 4-hour test which is split into 10 events (see below). Each event was either a reduced version of the full event when played in competition or a written paper. Each event carries a maximum score
of 100 points so the maximum possible score is 1000 points.
The complexity of setting the event and marking it has meant that the only place to have held a Decamentathlon is the Mind Sports Olympiad where the annual world championship is held.

The Decamentathlon was originally divided into ten tests in the following events: bridge, chess, creative thinking, draughts 8x8 / checkers, go, intelligence, mastermind, memory skills, mental calculations, othello.

The memory section was initially run in a fixed format where competitors have to memorise a single deck of cards and a list of 48 random words (previously the second part was memorisation of a 96 digit number).
From 2008 the Decamentathlon world championships was held using a backgammon test in the place of bridge.

For 2011 the memory section was switched again, the random words section being replaced by a random 50 digit number to be memorised. The othello and backgammon sections were also removed in favour of a Sudoku test and a Word puzzles test.

== Controversy ==

There has been controversy over the claim that the event had an inherent English language bias. This was especially on the sections of creative thinking and intelligence. This view is reinforced by there only having been one non-native English speaker to have won the World Championships, Gert Schnider from Austria. Although, the fact that three of the winners of the Decamentathlon have won the Pentamind in years other than when they won the Decamentathlon implies that this bias might be small.
There have also been issues of marking errors and the official answers not being accurate. This has resulted in medals being changed after they have been presented.

== Champions ==
The World Championships have taken place as part of the MSO since 1997.

All M family engines were OHC designs. While the M family was born with a chain-driven single camshaft it evolved into a belt-driven DOHC system after 1980. All M family engines used a cast-iron block with an aluminum cylinder head, and were built at the Toyota Kamigo plant in Toyota City, Japan.

The M-E variant, available only in the Japanese domestic market, was the first Toyota engine to be equipped with fuel injection (around the same time as the 4-cylinder 18R-E). The 4M-E was the first Toyota engine to be equipped with fuel injection for non-Japanese markets. The M family were Toyota&#x27;s most prestigious engines (apart from the uncommon &quot;V family&quot; V8) for over 30 years. They were commonly found on the large Toyota Crown, Mark II, and Supra models.




==M==
The first M was a version produced from 1965 through 1988. It was a 2-valve SOHC engine. Cylinder bore and stroke was square at . Output was at 5,200 to 5600 rpm, depending on specifications and model year. Typical torque is at 3,800 rpm.

The &quot;M-C&quot; engine, for commercial vehicles such as the Crown Van produces .

Twin sidedraft SU Carburettors pushed output for the M-B and M-D to at 5,800 rpm.

Anti emissions versions, the M-U and M-EU, replaced the M and M-E on the Japanese market in mid 1976. The emissions system was called TTC (Toyota Total Clean), with a &quot;-C&quot; to denote the installation of a catalytic converter. For commercial vehicles, the emissions controlled carburetted version was called the M-J.

==3M==
Another naturally aspirated inline 6, with both squared bore and stroke of and equipped with 3 Mikuni-Solex 40 PHH carburetors, the 2 valves per cylinder DOHC 3M, was produced from 1966 through 1971. This special engine shared the original M&#x27;s block but featured an aluminum sump, a special Yamaha-designed aluminum head with wide 79° valves and a hemispherical shape. It powered the Yamaha/Toyota MF10 2000GT, which &#x27;Import Tuner&#x27; magazine has described as &quot;the first true original Japanese supercar&quot;. Output was at 6,600 rpm and at 5,000 rpm and a Compression ratio of 8.4:1.

Applications (calendar years):
* Toyota 2000GT MF10


==4M==
The engine was bored out to to create the 2-valve SOHC 4M. Produced from 1972 through 1980, output was at 5,600 rpm and at 3,600 rpm.

The fuel-injected 4M-E was produced from 1978 through 1980. It was also a 2-valve SOHC engine. Output was at 4,800 rpm and at 2,400 rpm.

Applications (calendar years):
* 1978–1980 Toyota Supra
* 1974–1980 Corona Mark II/Cressida
* 1971–1979 Toyota Crown

== 5M==
The bore was up again to in the 5M, produced from 1979 through 1988. Although 2-valve SOHC and carbureted versions were made, it is the fuel-injected DOHC 5M-GE that is the most common.

The original federalized version of the SOHC engine produced just at 4,800 rpm and at 3,600 rpm.

In Australia the 5M-E (in 1985) had at 4,800 rpm and at 3,600 rpm due to the particular emissions standards at the time. This engine was used in the Supra in Australia as well as Sweden and Switzerland, while Swiss buyers were also offered this engine in the Cressida and the Crown.

In Europe (aside from Sweden and Switzerland, who received the same spec engine as Australia) the 5M-E produced in the Crown MS112 and the Celica Supra MA61.

==5M-GE==
The 12-valve (2 valves per cylinder) DOHC 5M-GE is familiar as the engine of the Toyota Supra and Toyota Cressida of the 1980s. It was quite different from any previous member of the M family, with Bosch L-Jetronic-derived electronic fuel-injection (using an AFM intake measuring scheme), wide-angle valves, and belt-driven dual camshafts. It used hydraulic valve lifters, a first for Toyota. The use of rocker arms and valve lash adjusters eliminated the need for valve clearance maintenance, a world first for any twin cam engine. This version of the M made its US debut in 1982&#x27;s Toyota Celica Supra MK2. The 1982 version had a vacuum-advance distributor, whereas the 1983–1988 versions found in the Celica Supra and Cressida had full electronic control of the ignition system and distributor. The newer engine control system found in these later cars was named TCCS, or Toyota Computer Control System and, together with different intake runners, increased max power by from August 1983.

Output ranged from , depending on exhaust system, emissions controls, compression ratio, intake runner shape (earlier models had round intake runners and later models had D-shaped intake runners), and ECU tuning.

There were aftermarket crank and piston kits offered for the 5M-GE that took the displacement up to 2.9 L for and 3.1 L for . Outfitted with kits like the Kuwahara 3100, these engines were often used quite successfully in powerboat racing in the mid 1980s.

Specifications:
* Valvetrain: DOHC 2 valves per cylinder
* Forced Induction: None
* Displacement: 
* Bore x stroke: 
* Compression Ratio: 8.1:1 to 9.2:1
* Power: 
* Torque: 
* Production: 1982–1988

Applications (calendar years):
* 1981.07–1986 Toyota Celica XX/Supra &quot;MA61&quot;
* 1982–1988 Toyota Cressida &quot;MX62&quot;, &quot;MX63&quot;, &quot;MX72&quot;, &quot;MX73&quot;
* 1981.08–1984.08 Toyota Crown &quot;MS120&quot;
* 1981.02–1983.08 Toyota Soarer &quot;MZ11&quot;

Differences between years on US model of the Celica Supra:
* 1982 Supra 5M-GE had vacuum-advance distributors and 9-to-0 volt output AFMs.
* 1982–1983 Supra 5M-GE had dual V-belt accessory drive, 65 amp alternator, square-tooth camshaft belts, 8.8:1 compression ratio, shallower oil pan, and round intake runners.
* 1983–1985.5 Supra 5M-GE had 0- to 5-volt output AFM&#x27;s and TCCS.
* 1984–1985.5 Supra 5M-GE had 7-rib serpentine accessory drive belts, 60 amp alternator, round-tooth camshaft belts, 9.2:1 compression ratio, knock sensor, deeper oil pan, and D-shaped intake runners.


==6M-GE==
Toyota increased the 5M-GE&#x27;s stroke to to create the 6M-GE. This necessitated the fitment of larger diameter intake runners versus . Only produced in 12-valve (2 valves per cylinder) DOHC/fuel-injected versions, it was available as the 6M-GE and Japan-spec 6M-GEU from 1984 through 1987. The 6M engine used the same crank, machined to accept a different torsional damper, as the 1986–1989 7M-GE and 7M-GTE engines; this fact is witnessed by the designation &quot;6M&quot; stamped on the counterweight of the crank on the earlier 1986–1988 7M engines.

Output was at 5,600 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. The 6M-GEU is usually the lower powered variant of 6M engines, due to more restrictive exhaust and increased emissions-control hardware. Even though it was never offered in US-market vehicles, it is sometimes imported from countries where it was available and transplanted into US-market Celica Supras and MX63 and MX73 Cressidas, since it is externally identical to the 5M-GE.

Applications (calendar years):
* Toyota Crown
* Toyota Soarer (&quot;MZ12&quot;)


==7M-GE==
The Toyota 7M-GE introduced in the early months of 1986 is a 24-valve (4 valves per cylinder) DOHC/fuel-injected engine. The valves are spaced at a performance-oriented 50° angle. Cylinder bore and stroke is .

The 7M-GE was produced from 1986 through 1992. Output was at 6,000 rpm and at 3,600 rpm.

* Toyota Cressida 3.0i Twincam/3.0GLS (MX75) South Africa only


==7M-GTE==
The turbocharged 7M-GTE was produced from 1986 to 1992. Output was at 5,600 rpm and at 3,200 rpm for most versions. It was Toyota&#x27;s top performance engine until it was replaced by the JZ-series engines.

Toyota produced a variant of the existing Japanese-market 7M-GTEU which featured a modified CT26 high-flow turbocharger and large volume intercooler, pushed output to at 5,600 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. This was used only in the racing homologation Toyota Supra Turbo A road and race cars. The Turbo A models also measured air based on manifold pressure rather than using an air flow meter, had a larger intercooler, larger throttle body, optimized CT-26 turbo, and various other differences. It was one of the fastest Japanese cars at the time. The homologation was for the Group A series. The Group A Supra with a 7M-GTE and CT26 turbo produced .

Specifications:

<text>The Mojave phone booth ( ) was a lone telephone booth in what is now the Mojave National Preserve in California. It attracted online attention in 1997 for its unusual location – it was located at the intersection of two dirt roads in a remote part of the Mojave Desert, from the nearest paved road (Interstate 15 to the northeast, Kelbaker Road to the southwest) and miles from any buildings.

==History==

The phone booth was originally set up in 1948 to provide telephone service to local volcanic cinder miners and others living in the area, at the request of Emerson Ray, who owned the Cima Cinder Mine nearby. It was assigned the name Cinder Peak Policy Station, part of a network of &quot;policy stations&quot; placed by mandate of the California government to serve residents of isolated parts of the state. The Mojave phone booth probably replaced an earlier booth to the south. The original hand-cranked magneto phone was replaced with a payphone in the 1960s. The rotary phone was then replaced with a touch-tone model in the 1970s. The booth phone&#x27;s original number was BAker-3-9969. After area codes were established in 1947, it shared the same area code as all of Southern California, 213. In 1951, the area code 714 was split off from 213, and 714 was the booth&#x27;s area code until 1982 when parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties were given the area code 619. The booth&#x27;s area code for its final few years of existence was 760.

In 1997, a Los Angeles man spotted a telephone icon on a map of the Mojave Desert and decided to visit it. He wrote a letter about his adventure to an underground magazine and included the booth&#x27;s telephone number. An Arizona man, Godfrey Daniels, read the letter and started a website devoted to the Mojave telephone booth. The booth became an Internet sensation after it was mentioned in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article. Soon other people began calling the booth, others made websites about it, and a few even took trips to the booth to answer, often camping out at the site. Several callers kept recordings of their conversations. Over time, the booth became covered in graffiti left by visitors.

==Removal==
The booth was removed by Pacific Bell on May 17, 2000, at the request of the National Park Service. Per Pacific Bell policy, the phone number was retired. Officially, the removal was because of visitors&#x27; environmental impact on the national preserve, and a letter by the Mojave National Preserve&#x27;s superintendent mentions confronting Pacific Bell with some long-forgotten easement fees. A headstone-like plaque was later placed at the site, but it too was eventually removed by the National Park Service. Fans of the booth feared that Pacific Bell had destroyed the booth, which was confirmed by Pac-Bell spokesperson Steve Getzug.

The story inspired the creation of an independent short film, &quot;Dead Line&quot;, a short documentary, &quot;Mojave Mirage&quot;, and a full-length motion picture, &quot;Mojave Phone Booth&quot;. The booth was also an inspiration for the prologue of the Glenn Beck novel &quot;The Overton Window&quot;, and is the subject of a 99% Invisible podcast episode, &quot;Mojave Phone Booth&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Adventures with the Mojave Phone Booth&quot; was published, a full-length book chronicling the booth&#x27;s history, rise to fame, destruction, and aftermath.

==Revival of the phone number==
AT&amp;T&#x27;s PacBell no longer owns the Baker, California +1-760-733-9XXX block of one thousand numbers, having relinquished it to competitive local exchange carrier peerlessnetwork.com on March 28, 2013, as part of a number pooling scheme. The Mojave phone booth&#x27;s number, 760-733-9969, was acquired from the CLEC by phone phreak Lucky225 on July 31, 2013, and would ring using voice over IP to a conference he and Teli Tuketu set up, as well as a text based IRC-like chat. Callers joined a conference where strangers could once again connect just like when the phone booth was active.

<text>Walerand Teutonicus was a Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports during the thirteenth century.

==Overview==
A feature of British maritime history of this period was the appointment, generally by county, of one or more &quot;keepers of the coast&quot;, which led in time to the consolidation of the powers of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The office was not continuous, and such men were more often called upon during a time of war, or when a threat was perceived in the Channel. Thus such records have survived for the reign of Edward III of England preceding the Battle of Sluys in 1340.

In addition to a military command both at sea and on land, judicial matters relating to the sea and coast came within the Keepers&#x27; remit. They were expected to crush piracy, repel raiders, protect coasters and fishermen, and summon the county to arms if there was a threat of invasion. Under the care of the keeper was the line of fire beacons, corresponding to the modern coastguard stations, usually placed on a hill near the shore and guarded in war time by a watch from the neighbouring parishes.

John Marshal was keeper of the ports of Somerset and Dorset in 1215, and in 1224 Ralph Germun was a keeper of the Dorset coast. In the year 1230 Geoffery de Lucy was Warden of Portsmouth, Hythe and Romney, Constable of Dover Castle. Henry de Sandwich was warden of Dover and Sandwich, whilst Shoreham, Winchelsea, Rye, Hastings, Seaford and Pevensea were under the administration of the Constable of Hastings.

In 1235 Hamo de Crevecur, who was appointed Lord Warden in 1263 shared joint control with Walerand Teutonicus, of the coast between Hastings and Poole, in Dorset.

<text>Javier Zapata Cuartas (born January 15, 1973, in Medellín, Antioquia) is a Colombian biketrial rider who performs the sport of biketrial, a sport that is little known internationally but very popular in Colombia. Zapata is arguably the sport&#x27;s most visible performer.

==Biography==
He began his sport career at age nine. Back then he was a BMX rider and he won numerous national and international championships. In 1995 he began his career as a biketrial rider. Zapata was the first person to get a biketrial bike in Colombia, which was specially manufactured for him by the GT manufacturing company there. Having been an expert BMX racer, Zapata, who placed 5th at the BMX world championships once and ran at BMX tournaments for eight years, quickly became used to the new type of bike he was riding, and decided to dedicate himself to promote his new sport in Colombia.

Zapata then toured all over Colombia, performing at multiple shows and earning money for each of his presentations. His stunts impressed many; he would use some of the first money he gained to travel to Spain, where he came in fifth place at biketrial&#x27;s first world championship. Later on, he went to Barcelona, where he entered the Guinness Book of Records by using his bike to climb the stairs of the tallest building of that city all the way to the top, without ever using his feet. Zapata later on travelled to Japan, where he once again climbed the stairs of some buildings with his bike, without using his feet.

In 2001, he returned to Barcelona, once again to participate at the world championships.

He is the only Colombian athlete that has achieved four Guinness World Records. His latest Guinness World Record was achieved in Mexico City in 2003. He climbed up in his bike the 1318 stairs of Torre Mayor, the tallest building in Latin America. His other Guinness World Records were obtained in Caracas (Venezuela), Bogota and Medellin (Colombia). In 2006 he obtained a new National Record jumping on his bike over the largest number of persons (23 persons).

He also performed a stunt show during half-time of a Copa Libertadores football game between Colombia and Ecuador in 2003.

Javier Zapata lives in Medellín where he runs his own biketrial school and his own brand ZAPATABIKES which produces bikes and accessories. He rides a Monty 221 Ti Full disc 2007 Hope Monotrial, Zapatabikes MTB.

<doc id="1056980" wikidata="Q1542622" url="?curid=1056980" title="Bid–ask spread">
<text>The bid–ask spread (also bid–offer or bid/ask and buy/sell in the case of a market maker) is the difference between the prices quoted (either by a single market maker or in a limit order book) for an immediate sale (ask) and an immediate purchase (bid) for stocks, futures contracts, options, or currency pairs in some auction scenario. The size of the bid–ask spread in a security is one measure of the liquidity of the market and of the size of the transaction cost. If the spread is 0 then it is a frictionless asset.

==Liquidity==
The trader initiating the transaction is said to demand liquidity, and the other party (counterparty) to the transaction supplies liquidity. Liquidity demanders place market orders and liquidity suppliers place limit orders. For a round trip (a purchase and sale together) the liquidity demander pays the spread and the liquidity supplier earns the spread. All limit orders outstanding at a given time (i.e. limit orders that have not been executed) are together called the Limit Order Book. In some markets such as NASDAQ, dealers supply liquidity. However, on most exchanges, such as the Australian Securities Exchange, there are no designated liquidity suppliers, and liquidity is supplied by other traders. On these exchanges, and even on NASDAQ, institutions and individuals can supply liquidity by placing limit orders.

The bid–ask spread is an accepted measure of liquidity costs in exchange traded securities and commodities. On any standardized exchange, two elements comprise almost all of the transaction cost—brokerage fees and bid–ask spreads. Under competitive conditions, the bid–ask spread measures the cost of making transactions without delay. The difference in price paid by an urgent buyer and received by an urgent seller is the liquidity cost. Since brokerage commissions do not vary with the time taken to complete a transaction, differences in bid–ask spread indicate differences in the liquidity cost.

== Types of spreads ==

=== Quoted spread ===
The simplest type of bid-ask spread is the quoted spread. This spread is taken directly from quotes, that is, posted prices. Using quotes, this spread is the difference between the lowest asking price (the lowest price at which someone will sell) and the highest bid price (the highest price at which someone will buy). This spread is often expressed as a percent of the midpoint, that is, the average between the lowest ask and highest bid: formula_1.

=== Effective spread ===
Quoted spreads often over-state the spreads finally paid by traders, due to &quot;price improvement&quot;, that is, a dealer offering a better price than the quotes, also known as &quot;trading inside the spread&quot;. Effective spreads account for this issue by using trade prices, and are typically defined as: formula_2. The effective spread is more difficult to measure than the quoted spread, since one needs to match trades with quotes and account for reporting delays (at least pre-electronic trading). Moreover, this definition embeds the assumption that trades above the midpoint are buys and trades below the midpoint are sales.

=== Realized spread ===
Quoted and effective spreads represent costs incurred by traders. This cost includes both a cost of asymmetric information, that is, a loss to traders that are more informed, as well as a cost of immediacy, that is, a cost for having a trade being executed by an intermediary. The realized spread isolates the cost of immediacy, also known as the &quot;real cost&quot;. This spread is defined as: formula_3 where the subscript k represents the kth trade. The intuition for why this spread measures the cost of immediacy is that, after each trade, the dealer adjusts quotes to reflect the information in the trade (and inventory effects).

Inner price moves are moves of the bid-ask price where the spread has been deducted.

== Examples ==
=== Currency spread ===
If the current bid price for the EUR/USD currency pair is 1.5760 and the current offer price is 1.5763, this means that currently you can sell the EUR/USD at 1.5760 and buy at 1.5763. The difference between those prices (3 pips) is the spread.

If the USD/JPY currency pair is currently trading at 101.89/101.92, that is another way of saying that the bid for the USD/JPY is 101.89 and the offer is 101.92. This means that currently, holders of USD can sell US$1 for 101.89 JPY and investors who wish to buy dollars can do so at a cost of 101.92 JPY per US$1.

=== Metals ===
Gold and silver are known for having the tightest bid-ask spreads, making them useful as money, while other metals may have wider bid-ask spreads due to lower trading volumes, less liquidity, or large fluctuations in supply and demand. For example, rare metals like platinum, palladium, and rhodium have lower trading volumes compared to gold or silver, which can result in larger bid-ask spreads.

<doc id="1056981" wikidata="Q7101775" url="?curid=1056981" title="Organ flue pipe scaling">
<text>Scaling is the ratio of an organ pipe&#x27;s diameter to its length. The scaling of a pipe is a major influence on its timbre. Reed pipes are scaled according to different formulas than for flue pipes. In general, the larger the diameter of a given pipe at a given pitch, the fuller and more fundamental the sound becomes.

==The effect of the scale of a pipe on its timbre==

The sound of an organ pipe is made up of a set of harmonics formed by acoustic resonance, with wavelengths that are fractions of the length of the pipe. There are nodes of stationary air, and antinodes of moving air, two of which will be the two ends of an open-ended organ-pipe (the mouth, and the open end at the top). The actual position of the antinodes is not exactly at the end of the pipe; rather it is slightly outside the end. The difference is called an end correction. The difference is larger for wider pipes. For example, at low frequencies, the additional effective length at the open pipe is about formula_1, where formula_2 is the radius of the pipe. However, the end correction is also smaller at higher frequencies. This shorter effective length raises the pitch of the resonance, so the higher resonant frequencies of the pipe are &#x27;too high&#x27;, sharp of where they should be, as natural harmonics of the fundamental note. 

This effect suppresses the higher harmonics. The wider the pipe, the greater the suppression. Thus, other factors being equal, wide pipes are poor in harmonics, and narrow pipes are rich in harmonics. The scale of a pipe refers to its width compared to its length, and an organ builder will refer to a flute as a wide-scaled stop, and a string-toned gamba as a narrow-scaled stop.

==Dom Bédos de Celles and the problem of scaling across a rank of pipes==

The lowest pipes in a rank are long, and the highest are short. The progression of the length of pipes is dictated by physics alone, and the length must halve for each octave. Since there are twelve semitones in an octave, each pipe differs from its neighbours by a factor of formula_3. If the diameters of the pipes are scaled in the same way, so each pipe has exactly the same proportions, it is found that the perceived timbre and volume vary greatly between the low notes and the high, and the result is not musically satisfactory. This effect has been known since antiquity, and part of the organ builder&#x27;s art is to scale pipes such that the timbre and volume of a rank vary little, or only according to the wishes of the builder. One of the first authors to publish data on the scaling of organ pipes was Dom Bédos de Celles. The basis of his scale was unknown until Mahrenholz discovered that the scale was based on one in which the width halved for each octave, but with addition of a constant. This constant compensates for the inappropriate narrowing of the highest pipes, and if chosen with care, can match modern scalings to within the difference of diameter that one would expect from pipes sounding notes about two semi-tones apart.

==Töpfer&#x27;s &quot;Normalmensur&quot; ==

The system most commonly used to fully document and describe scaling was devised by Johann Gottlob Töpfer. Since varying the diameter of a pipe in direct proportion to its length (which means it varies by a factor of 1:2 per octave) caused the pipes to narrow too rapidly, and keeping the diameter constant (a factor of 1:1 per octave) was too little, the correct change in scale must be between these values. Töpfer reasoned that the cross-sectional area of the pipe was the critical factor, and he chose to vary this by the geometric mean of the ratios 1:2 and 1:4 per octave. This meant that the cross-sectional area varied as formula_4. In consequence, the diameter of the pipe halved after 16 semitone intervals, i.e. on the 17th note (musicians count the starting-note as the first, so if C is the first note, C# is the second, differing by one semitone). Töpfer was able to confirm that if the diameter of the pipes in a rank halved on the 17th note, its volume and timbre remained adequately constant across the entire organ keyboard. He established this as a standard scale, or in German, Normalmensur, with the additional stipulation that the internal diameter be at 8′ C (the lowest note of the modern organ compass) and the mouth width one-quarter of the circumference of such a pipe.

Töpfer&#x27;s system provides a reference scale, from which the scale of other pipe ranks can be described by means of &quot;half-tone&quot; deviations larger or smaller (indicated by the abbreviation &quot;ht&quot;). A rank that also halves in diameter at the 17th note but is somewhat wider could be described as &quot;+ 2 ht&quot; meaning that the pipe corresponding to the note &quot;D&quot; has the width expected for a pipe of the note &quot;C&quot;, two semitones below (and therefore two semitone intervals wider). If a rank does not halve exactly at the 17th note, then its relationship to the Normalmensur will vary across the keyboard. The system can therefore be used to produce Normalmensur variation tables or line graphs for the analysis of existing ranks or the design of new ranks.

The following is a list of representative 8′ stops in order of increasing diameter (and, therefore, of increasingly fundamental tone) at middle C with respect to Normalmensur, which is listed in the middle. Deviations from Normalmensur are provided after the pipe measurement in brackets.

* Viole d&#x27;orchestre (thin, mordant string stop): 35.6 mm [-10 ht]

* November 27, 1854 (): The new era name of &quot;Ansei&quot; (meaning &quot;tranquil government&quot;) was created to herald the beginning of a peaceful period. The impetus and explanation for this change of era names was said to have been the burning of the Palace in Kyoto in the preceding summer.

The new era name was derived from an hortatory aphorism: &quot;Rule peacefully over the masses, then the ruler will remain in his place&quot; (庶民安政、然後君子安位矣).

Although the notion seems appealing, the arrival of the Black Ships and Commodore Matthew C. Perry is not specifically recognized as a factor in the change of era names.

== Events of the &quot;Ansei&quot; era ==
* 1854 (&quot;Ansei 1&quot;): The Ansei-Tōkai Quake (安政東海地震, &quot;Ansei Tōkai Jishin&quot;) was an 8.4 magnitude earthquake which struck on December 23, 1854. The epicenter ranged from Suruga Bay to the deep ocean, and struck primarily in the Tōkai region, but destroyed houses as far away as in Edo. The accompanying tsunami caused damage along the entire coast from the Bōsō Peninsula in modern-day Chiba Prefecture to Tosa Province (modern-day Kōchi Prefecture)
* 1854 (&quot;Ansei 1&quot;): The Ansei-Nankai Quake (安政南海地震, &quot;Ansei Nankai Jishin&quot;) was an 8.4 magnitude earthquake which struck on December 24, 1854. Over 10,000 people from the Tōkai region down to Kyushu were killed.
* 1855 (&quot;Ansei 2&quot;): Work was begun on re-constructing the Imperial Palace after the devastating fire of &quot;Kaei&quot; 7, and the project was completed in nine months.
* 1855 (&quot;Ansei 2, 21st day of the 11th month&quot;): The emperor moved into the reconstructed palace, having previously lived in the Shōgo-in and then Katsura-no-miya. The people were permitted to view the grand Imperial progress.
* November 11, 1855 (&quot;Ansei 2&quot;): 1855 Edo earthquake, one of the Ansei great earthquakes, with resulting fire damage and loss of life. Epicenter – (Latitude: 36.000/Longitude: 140.000), 6.9 magnitude on the Richter Scale.
* November 15, 1857 (&quot;Ansei 4&quot;): Nagasaki Medical School is opened. Dr. Pompe van Meerdevoort gave the first formal public lecture on medical and surgical sciences at the new school, which became as well the first such lecture to be delivered in any Japanese venue.
* 1858–1860 (&quot;Ansei 5-Ansei 7&quot;): Cholera outbreak is believed to have killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people in Edo alone.

* 1858 (&quot;Ansei 5&quot;): The initial establishment of Keio University, seven years before the beginning of the &quot;Keio&quot; era; nevertheless, the university was named after the later era. This is the oldest existing institution of higher learning in Japan.

==Change of era==
* February 28, 1848 : The era name of &quot;Kaei&quot; (meaning &quot;eternal felicity&quot;) was created to mark the beginning of the reign of the Emperor Kōmei.

The era name is derived from an aphorism in the &quot;Book of Song&quot;: &quot;A wise Emperor receives much help, One who esteems comfort is on the outside&quot; ().

==Events of the &quot;Kaei&quot; Era==
* July 1848 (&quot;Kaei 1&quot;): Ranald MacDonald, (b. 1824, Astoria, Oregon) left the whaler &quot;Plymouth&quot; in a small boat and landed on Rishiri Island. He was arrested and sent from Rishiri to Nagasaki where he was incarcerated; MacDonald began teaching English to 14 scholars, including Einosuke Moriyama, who later became an interpreter for the Japanese government when Matthew C. Perry entered Japan in 1854 (thus, in Japan, MacDonald is regarded as &quot;The first native-speaking English teacher in Japanese history).
* 1849 (&quot;Kaei 2&quot;): Medical practice of vaccination introduced by Dutch physician, Dr. Mohnike, at Dejima.
* July 1853 (&quot;Kaei 6&quot;): Commodore Matthew Perry, commanding the United States Navy&#x27;s East Indies fleet, arrives in Japanese waters with four ships.
* 1854 (&quot;Kaei 7&quot;): Commodore Perry returns to Edo Bay to force Japanese agreement to the Treaty of Kanagawa; and the chief Japanese negotiator was &quot;Daigaku-no kami&quot; Hayashi Akira (1800–1859), who was head of the Tokugawa bakufu&#x27;s neo-Confucian academy in Edo, the &quot;Shōhei-kō&quot; (&quot;Yushima Seidō&quot;).
:&quot;Immediately, on signing and exchanging copies of the treaty, Commodore Perry presented the first commissioner, Prince Hayashi, with an American flag stating that this gift was the highest expression of national courtesy and friendship he could offer. The prince was deeply moved, and expressed his gratitude with evident feeling. The commodore next presented the other commissioners with gifts he had especially reserved for them. All business now having been concluded to the satisfaction of both delegations, the Japanese commissioners invited Perry and his officers to enjoy a feast and entertainment especially prepared for the celebration.&quot; -- &quot;from American eyewitness account of the event&quot;
* May 2, 1854 (&quot;Kaei 7, the 6th day of the 4th month&quot;): Fire broke out in the Sentō, and the conflagration spread to the Imperial palace. Both were destroyed. The emperor took refuge at Shimokam and afterwards went to Shōgon-in.
* November 4–7, 1854 (&quot;Kaei 7&quot;): Great Nankaidō earthquakes and tsunamis kill 80,000 people. An earthquake and tsunami struck Shimoda on the Izu peninsula; and because the port had just been designated as the prospective location for a U.S. consulate, some construed the natural disasters as demonstration of the displeasure of the &quot;kami&quot;.
* 1854 (&quot;Kaei 7, 27th day of the 11th month&quot;): The era name was changed to Ansei (meaning &quot;tranquil government&quot;), which was meant to herald the beginning of a peaceful period. The impetus and explanation for this change of era names was said to have been the burning of the Palace in Kyoto in the preceding summer.

<text>Peter de Rivaux or Peter de Rivallis (died 1262) was an influential Poitevin courtier at the court of Henry III of England. He was related to Peter des Roches, being a nephew (or possibly a son).

From early in his life he was connected to the church hierarchy. In 1204, when still very young he was presented to a host of churches in the diocese of Lincoln once patronised by Gilbert de Beseby. His application to the bishop (possibly his father) was necessary as he was below canonical age. That did not prevent him from becoming one of the king&#x27;s chamberlains in 1218 when he was a clerk of the wardrobe. For five years he served the king&#x27;s inner sanctum, a recipient of the king&#x27;s extravagant generosity. He held the office of Keeper of the Coast, the precursor to Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, from the year 1232, and intermittently up until the outbreak of the Second Barons&#x27; War. Peter was in effect Henry&#x27;s chief minister, from 1232 onwards for a short period, holding positions in the king&#x27;s household and being installed as sheriff (or granted the power to appoint sheriffs in his stead) for some 21 shires. His administration included Stephen Segrave (high sheriff of several counties), Henry of Bath (high sheriff of Gloucestershire), Robert Papelew and Brian de Lisle, and achieved a centralisation under his hand of much royal revenue. He also held the office of Lord High Treasurer from 14 January 1233 to 1234.

He fell dramatically from power in April 1234, consequent on the death of Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, which was attributed to the machinations of Peter des Roches. The Poitevins had fallen from grace due to unpopularity among the Anglo-Norman nobility. For a time Peter de Rivaux and associates were proclaimed traitors, and Bristol Castle and custody of Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany was taken by William de Talbot. Some partial rehabilitation followed. They demanded that Peter take the tonsure, surrender his worldly goods and return to monastic chastity. Sent to the Tower of London, he was expelled from the Court on his release, banished to the sanctuary of Winchester. However, his discomfiture did not last long. He was soon asked back to Westminster to resume duties in the wardrobe. By 1251, his debts were all repaid, for Henry of Winchester had forgiven his old friend. On 16 July 1255, he was elevated to be a Baron of the Exchequer after years of training in the law courts. For a brief time he was raised to become Treasurer of all England, but probably died in 1258, having recovered estates near Winchester.

<text>He&#x27;s a Lady is an American reality television series broadcast by TBS. The six-episode series premiered on October 19, 2004, and concluded on November 23, 2004. Filmed in Los Angeles, California, the series depicted eleven cisgender men in competition for a $250,000 reward over who could pass themselves off as a more convincing woman. The contestants were required to cross-dress and adopt feminine personas, which were then introduced to their family and friends. The contestants additionally competed in weekly challenges that required them to embrace femininity. The competition culminated in a beauty pageant, which was judged by a celebrity panel. The series was hosted by American television presenter Tony Frassrand.

&quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; was a part of TBS&#x27;s intent to capitalize on a rising interest in LGBT-themed reality television shows. The series was met with unfavorable reviews by critics, who believed that, despite an interesting concept, the series was poorly executed. &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; additionally received fierce criticism from the American Family Association, a Christian fundamentalist organization, who urged the series&#x27; sponsors to pull their advertisements and financial support due to concerns of misandry. The series premiered to 1.70 million viewers, although its viewership quickly waned over the course of the season. In 2004, &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; was the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit filed against TBS and production company Evolution Film &amp; Tape.

==Format==

Set in Los Angeles, the six-episode series depicted eleven cisgender men in competition for a reward of $250,000. The contestants initially believed that they were competing in a fitness competition titled &quot;All American Man&quot;; upon arrival, they learned that they would be required to cross-dress in an effort to pass themselves off as women. The contestants, who adopted feminine personas, were required to move into a boisterous, pink-and-purple dwelling referred to as &quot;The Doll House&quot;. In an effort to &quot;live as a lady,&quot; the contestants were taught about brassieres and jewelry in addition to competing in weekly gender-specific challenges; challenges included modeling, wedding planning, serving as a bridesmaid, and household chores. A contestant was eliminated from the competition each week at the discretion of a celebrity panel, which included Morgan Fairchild, Debbie Matenopoulos, and John Salley. At the culmination of the series, the finalists competed in a beauty pageant, in which they had to explain what they &quot;learned about being a man&quot; over the course of the competition. The series was hosted by American television presenter Tony Frassrand.

==Production==
&quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; was green-lit in early 2004, with production commencing shortly afterward. The series was filmed in Los Angeles, California, over the course of three weeks. TBS executives intended to capitalize on the rising success of the reality television genre, in which they hoped &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; and &quot;The Real Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; &quot;would pioneer a genre we call comedic reality&quot;. On August 27, 2004, TBS officially announced &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; through a press release. The release described the series&#x27; premise as &quot;11 macho men [who are given] the opportunity to walk a mile in women’s shoes&quot;. The series was initially set to premiere on October 12, 2004, although this airdate was ultimately delayed to October 19, 2004. According to TBS spokesperson Gina McKenzie, the series was intended to &quot;break down barriers between men and women&quot; and illustrate how gender roles function in society. Executive producer Tom Campbell further explained that he wanted to assist the hypermasculine contestants in becoming more sensitive to the needs of women and change the way they approach women in the future. Speaking on his experience, contestant Ryan Katz stated: &quot;[&quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot;] was terrifying, tumultuous; it took my testosterone away. It was something I&#x27;ve never experienced.&quot;

Following the recent controversies and cancellations of other LGBT-themed reality television programs, executive producers Campbell and Douglas Ross were &quot;anxious&quot; to not offend the LGBT community. The producers were specifically concerned about the series&#x27; perceived depiction of transgender people and they did not want the contestants to &quot;equate the change of gender with a change of sexual orientation.&quot; The network offered the media monitoring organization GLAAD an advance copy of the series for review, however, GLAAD later claimed that they were the ones to reach out to producers after examination of the series&#x27; press release. GLAAD was concerned about the series&#x27; portrayal of LGBT people and wanted to ensure that it depicted LGBT representation more tactfully than the cancelled Fox special &quot;Seriously, Dude, I&#x27;m Gay&quot;. Through their consultation with GLAAD, Campbell claimed that the organization helped the producers to &quot;bec[o]me more aware of transgender issues and the double standards of beauty.&quot; One of the changes that producers implemented was using the phrase &quot;in character&quot; as opposed to &quot;in drag&quot; when they referred to the contestants&#x27; personas.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
&quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; drew sharp criticism from Christian fundamentalist organizations, including the American Family Association and the Traditional Values Coalition. The American Family Association claimed that the show was humorless and promoted &quot;life as a transvestite&quot; while the Traditional Values Coalition similarly condemned it as a &quot;new homosexual-inspired transvestite show.&quot; The organizations called for a boycott of &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot;, in which they urged its sponsors to drop the series. S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, who served as the series&#x27; principal sponsor, pulled their advertising and financial support due to pressure from the organizations.

==Lawsuit==
On November 23, 2004, &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; was subject to a lawsuit filed by screenwriters John Phillips and Derek Gerard. Known as &quot;Phillips v. Turner Broadcasting System&quot;, the suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and targeted the series&#x27; production company, Evolution Film &amp; Tape, alongside the series&#x27; network, TBS. The plaintiffs sought a reward of $3,000,000, in which they alleged copyright infringement, breach of implied-in-fact contract, and unfair competition. The plaintiffs claimed that their script &quot;Sex Change&quot;, which was previously pitched to TBS, was copied by the production company and network for &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot;. The concept of &quot;Sex Change&quot; was based on Phillips&#x27;s experience as an &quot;all-American&quot; athlete who later underwent gender-affirming surgery; he claimed that the production company and network &quot;stole part of my life&quot; with the production of &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot;. The plaintiffs and Evolution Film &amp; Tape previously shared the same booking agent, Cal Boyington. On October 3, 2005, the court dismissed the suit with prejudice; the parties bore their own legal costs and fees.

==International Versions==

A Russian version aired on Russian channel TNT (not to be confused with the American television network of the same name).

<doc id="1056997" wikidata="Q7351379" url="?curid=1056997" title="Robert de Auberville">
<text>Robert de Auberville (de Albervilla, in Latin), of Iham (Higham, in Icklesham) and Iden, Sussex, representative of a wealthy Norman family in Kent and Sussex, was a Justiciar in Kent, Constable of Hastings Castle, and Keeper of the Coast to King Henry III of England.

==Origins==
The de Auberville family was seated at Westenhanger, near Stanford, Kent. William de Auberville the elder, King&#x27;s Justiciar (son of Hugh de Auberville (the elder) and his wife Wynanc), married Matilda (Maud), eldest daughter of Ranulf de Glanville (Chief Justiciar of England to King Henry II) and his wife Bertha de Valoines. (Bertha&#x27;s sister was the wife of Hervey Walter, and mother of Archbishop Hubert Walter.)

William de Auberville (the elder) was associated with the foundation or patronage of various religious houses including the Augustinian Canons Regular of Butley Abbey (1171) and the Premonstratensians of Leiston Abbey (1182) in Suffolk, both founded by Ranulf, and by his own founding, c. 1192, of West Langdon Abbey in Kent, as from Leiston Abbey, assisted by the priors of both Suffolk houses. The Langdon foundation was confirmed by Simon de Averenches, Lord of Folkestone (died c. 1203) who, as his fee-lord, refers to &quot;the charter of my revered knight William de Auberville&quot;. William died c. 1195, and his heirs became wards of Hubert Walter.

William&#x27;s principal heir was his son Hugh (the younger), who inherited from him, but there was also a son William and a daughter Emma. Hugh de Auberville the younger, together with Robert his brother, were c. 1199-1205 witnesses to a charter of John of Eu, a son of John, Count of Eu, confirming to the Cistercian abbey of Robertsbridge in Sussex their tenements, liberties and customs in his fee of the Rape of Hastings. Hugh died c. 1212, whereupon William Briwere paid 1000 marks for custody of his lands, his heirs and their marriages. The inheritance descended through Hugh&#x27;s son William de Auberville the younger (died by 1248) to William&#x27;s daughter Joan, who married Nicholas de Crioll.

Robert de Auberville maintained connections with Robertsbridge Abbey, married the heiress of another of its patron families, and became settled at the western edge of Romney Marsh. Robertsbridge was originally founded in 1176 in the parish of Salehurst by Alvred de St. Martin, Sheriff of the Rape of Hastings, whose wife was Alice d&#x27;Aubigny, widow of John, Count of Eu.

==Marriage==

The Sheriff of Sussex was ordered to effect full seisin of the land of &quot;Ihōme&quot; and Iden in eastern Sussex to Robert de Auberville, in the right of his wife Claricia, which had been in the keeping of Hubert Walter, in July 1205. Claricia is identified as a daughter of Robert de Gosteling on the basis of a deed of quitclaim made by her to the priory of Christ Church, Canterbury of lands in the vicinity of Fairfield, Snave and Appledore, on the west side of Romney Marsh, near Iden. This shows her as the wife of Robert de Auberville, who has enclosed 36 acres from the sea. A further reference to her in the Curia Regis rolls shows that Claricia was the granddaughter of Samson de Gestling.

Samson and Robert de Gosteling appear frequently as witnesses to the Robertsbridge Abbey deeds. William de Auberville, as justiciar, presided at an early transaction, and Hugh, alone, at another. Robert witnessed three other Robertsbridge charters in the Lisle muniments. Sussex Fines of 1219 reflect the dealings of Robert and Claricia with the Abbey respecting lands at Northiam, Pett and Playden.

==Rebellions==
In 1210 King John took a large army to Ireland in order to suppress a revolt by the Anglo-Norman lords whom he held there in governance. Robert de Auberville fought in Ireland in that year, and Hugh is named in the same entry.

In 1215, following the sealing of Magna Carta at Runnymede, Robert de Auberville was with William d&#x27;Aubigny, William de Averenches, Reginald de Cornhill (the High Sheriff of Kent), Thomas de Moletun, Osbert Giffard and a hundred others who held Rochester Castle against King John, until he besieged them there and they were captured. At this time Cecilia, widow of Simon de Averenches, sold her manor of Sutton next Seaford to Robertsbridge, in order to ransom her son William.

Robert was however loyal to Henry III at the time of the revolt stirred up by William de Fortibus, Earl of Aumale, and in 1221, having been listed for the general levy of scutage, he was with the young king at the siege of the Earl&#x27;s castle at Bytham in Lincolnshire in February and March of that year. After the castle was fired a number of prisoners were taken, and on 15 March the order was given that he and Paul de Tayden should have charge of conducting them in their carts to London.

De Auberville was entrusted with a surety for the king by Rosamond, widow of Phillip de Girunde, for a fine of 20 marks to enable her to marry whom she pleased. In November 1222 the king paid him to buy horses for the use of Isabella, sister of Alexander II of Scotland when coming into his district. In August 1223 his name was listed to defend the king as far as Bedford.

In 1222 Robert appears among the witnesses to a charter, issued at Westminster, by William, son of Fulco, de Pamele in favour of Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Ghent.

==Assizes==
In 1226 Robert de Auberville and Henry de Sandwich were chosen by the king to replace justiciars in an assize in Canterbury. He sat in an assize in Rochester with justices William de Cyriton, Simon de Chelefeld and Simon de Craye in 1228, and in 1229, with Henry de Cobham, William de Dudinton and Robert de Rokeley, at Greenwich (an assize of Mort d&#x27;Ancestor) with Henry de Sandwich, and at Winchelsea with Simon de Echyngham, William de Munceiaus and William de Oym.

==Keeper of the Coast and Constable of Hastings==

From July 1225 Robert was Constable of Hastings Castle, and received regular payments for his fees and for works and operations there. In 1226 he and brother Thomas the Templar were appointed to receive money on behalf of Richard, Earl of Cornwall. He was appointed to the position of Keeper of the Coast, then the name given to the office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, in 1228. He was responsible for the general security of the ports between Sandwich and Portsmouth. He and Bertram de Criol, then Constable of Dover Castle, were favoured by a writ &quot;de intendendo&quot; issued to the bailiffs and barons of the Cinque Ports in 1229: in an equivalent writ of 1230, Henry de Sandwich appears in de Auberville&#x27;s place.

Robert witnessed a charter of confirmation to Hubert de Burgh in 1227. At about that time both he and Bertram de Criol also witnessed a grant to Hubert by Roger de Ware, and a companion deed of quitclaim, of land in Westminster, and also Hubert&#x27;s own grant of the church of St Leonard, Alderton to the Premonstratensian abbey of St Radegund at Bradsole. In 1229 he was among the principal witnesses to the foundation charter of Michelham Priory under the hand of Gilbert de Aquila.

In September 1229 he, with the sheriffs, received the king&#x27;s command to deliver all the ships that he held in the various ports capable of carrying 16 horses to Portsmouth by the end of the month for the king&#x27;s service, allowing any smaller vessels to go about their business. By the king&#x27;s order the custody of Hastings Castle, &quot;which Robert de Auberville had during the king&#x27;s pleasure&quot; was ordered to be given up by the Constable to John de Gatesden on 18 March 1230. In the spring of 1230 the King made his military expedition to Poitou, and in May full commands were given for the defence of the ports, in which John de Gatesden had some responsibility for Shoreham, Winchelsea, Rye and Seaford, in addition to Hastings and Pevensey Castles which he as Constable was especially instructed to prepare, arm and defend. Similar instructions were given to Bertram de Criol and Henry de Sandwich as Wardens of Dover and Sandwich respectively.

This surrender is taken by Paget to indicate that Robert had died by 1230. His name disappears from the Rolls. If he died then, the date of 1245 given by Planché for a grant by William de Auberville the younger (Hugh&#x27;s son) to the priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, witnessed by Sir Robert de Auberville, Sir Simon de Haute (Hauth) and Sir Simon de Sandwich, begs an explanation.

==Family==
Clarice, daughter and heiress of Robert de Auberville and Claricia de Gestling, is introduced in the medieval French &quot;ancestor romance&quot; (an early 14th-century prose narrative based on a lost metrical romance) called &quot;The History of Fulk Fitz Warin&quot;, as the second wife of Fulk III FitzWarin, the marcher lord with whom the second and third parts of that narrative are particularly concerned. Clarice de Auberville is described as the wife of his later years, during which Fulke, having been restored to his English lands and grown very old, became blind. This outline was followed as if factual, in his &quot;Baronage&quot;, by Sir William Dugdale, and, despite occasional doubts, later accounts of the family have accepted this precedent.

Clarice and her husband were living in 1250, when the Fine rolls record that they gave the king one mark for a writ &quot;ad terminum&quot; in the jurisdiction of Kent. In 1249 Fulk was recorded in the King&#x27;s Bench to have acknowledged that he had given and confirmed to his daughter Mabil his entire manor of Lambourn, Berkshire. They were the parents of:
* Ammabil (Mabel) FitzWarin (d. 1297), who married (1) William de Crèvequer, and (2) John de Tregoz (d. c.1300). There were two daughters by the second marriage.

<text>was a after &quot;Bunsei&quot; and before &quot;Kōka.&quot; The period spanned from December 1830 through December 1844. The reigning emperor was .

== Introduction ==

===Change of era===
* December 10, 1830 () : In the 13th year of &quot;Bunsei&quot;, the new era name of &quot;Tenpō&quot; (meaning &quot;Heavenly Imperial Protection&quot;) was created to mark the disasters of a great fire in Edo and an earthquake at Kyoto. The new era name was created from an hortatory aphorism: &quot;Respect and worship the Ways of heaven. Eternally keep the Mandate of Heaven&quot; (欽崇天道、永保天命).

The Tenpō era is often described as the beginning of the end of bakufu government. Though the era accomplished much through its reforms, and also culturally speaking, the injury inflicted on the Tokugawa system of government during the Tenpō period was unparalleled. Public order and dissatisfaction with government was a main issue, but the bakufu was not entirely at fault for the stir amongst the people. For example, the failure of crops in 1833, which soon became a lengthy disaster endured for over four years and was called the Great Tenpō famine. It was caused mainly by poor weather conditions. Because crops could not grow under these circumstances, prices began to skyrocket. These dire circumstances sparked many rebellions and riots across Japan over the course of the Tenpō years. Weary and desperate for someone to blame, the people rose up against the government, and Ōshio Heihachirō, known for leading one of the largest rebellions, made a statement to implicate &quot;the natural disasters as sure signs of Heavens&#x27;s discontent with the government&quot;. Mizuno Tadakuni&#x27;s reforms were meant to remedy these economic issues, but the reforms could not rescue the bakufu from its ultimate collapse.

The shogunate rule during the Tenpō era was that of Tokugawa Ieyoshi, the 12th &quot;shōgun&quot;&#x27; of the bakufu government. His reign lasted from 1837 to 1853. During this time, many factors appeared to have seen to the decline of his health: namely, the great and devastating famine, the many rebellions rising up against the bakufu, and the swift advance of foreign influence.

==Great Tenpō Famine==

The Great Tenpō famine of the 1830s was a devastating period in which the whole of Japan suffered rapidly decreasing temperatures and loss of crops, and in turn, merchant prices began to spike. Many starved to death during this grim time: &quot;The death rate for a village in the northeast rose to thirty-seven per thousand and that for the city of Takayama was nearly forty-five&quot;. As crops continued to decline in the countryside, prices increased, and a shortage of supplies left people competing to survive on meager funds. The rising expense of rice in particular, a staple food of the Japanese, was a firm blow to both the economy and the people, who starved because of it. Some even resorted to &quot;eating leaves and weeds, or even straw raincoats&quot;.

The samurai also suffered the effects of the famine, dealing with lower wages from the Japanese domain governments in anticipation of fiscal shortfalls to come. To further the already dire conditions of the famine, illness eventually began to spread, and many who were starving could not resist pestilences such as smallpox, measles and influenza. Thousands died from hunger alone at the peak of the crisis in 1836–1837.

==Rebellion==

One of the rebellions sparked by the Great Tenpō famine was the Ōshio Heihachirō Rebellion. The man for whom it was named led an attempted revolt in the 1830s, and was granted the label of &quot;yonaoshi daimyojin&quot;, or &quot;world saviour&quot;, for his attempts at moral restoration. Formally a police officer and scholar, Ōshio Heihachirō (1792-1837) had requested help from Osaka city commissioners and otherwise wealthy merchants in 1837, only to be met with indifference. Shocked by his lack of success in the endeavour, Ōshio instigated an uprising to oppose those who had refused their aid. With approximately 300 followers, including poor townsfolk and peasants from various villages, Ōshio set fire to one-fifth of Osaka city. But the rebellion was suppressed in short order, forcing Ōshio to a quick end in which he committed suicide.

The scholar Ikuta Yorozo (1801–1837) also instigated a rebellion from similar roots as that of Ōshio Heihachirō. Ikuta had opened a school for the education of adolescents, consisting mostly of peasants. Having also suffered from the Great Tenpō Famine, Ikuta despaired the lack of aid local bureaucrats were willing to provide, and in 1837, he assembled a band of peasants in retaliation. Together they launched an attack on the bureaucrats, which met with devastating results and ended with Ikuta taking his own life.

==Ogata Kōan and Tekijuku==

In 1838, a year following Ōshio Heihachirō&#x27;s rebellion, and after the fire that had scorched nearly a quarter of Osaka city, the physician Ogata Kōan founded an academy to teach medicine, healing and Rangaku, or Dutch Studies. The school was called Tekijuku, where distinction of status was unknown and competition abounded. Ogata encouraged this competitive learning, especially of the Dutch language to which he had dedicated much of his own study. However, the competition escalated and eventually students bent to the rigorous pressure of the academy, acting recklessly to vent frustrations. For example: &quot;slashing their swords against the central pillar of the main boarding hall, leaving gashes and nicks&quot;. Ogata did not deem it necessary to take disciplinary measures, thinking it harmless and recreational.

Much of Ogata&#x27;s life was devoted to Rangaku, which was clearly displayed in the vision he had for Tekijuku. Ogata is known in history for his attentions to the medical, or internal therapeutic aspects of Rangaku, including emphasis on diseases and his aid in translation of foreign medical terms.

==Restriction of foreign influence==
===Morrison incident===
In 1837, upon rescuing several stranded Japanese sailors, an American merchant ship called the &quot;Morrison&quot; endeavoured to return them to their homeland, hoping this venture would earn them the right to trade with Japan. However, the merchant ship was fired upon as it entered Japanese seas due to the Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels passed by Japan in 1825. This was later referred to as the Morrison incident.

However, there were some in Japan who criticized the government&#x27;s actions, namely the &quot;Bangaku Shachu&quot; a band of &quot;rangaku&quot; scholars who advocated a more open approach to the outside, perhaps to the extent of ending Japan&#x27;s long-standing &quot;sakoku&quot; policy. This stance against the shogunate riled the government into the &quot;Bansha no goku&quot;, arresting twenty-six members of the Bangaku Shachu, and reinforcing the policies on foreign education by limiting the publication of books, in addition to making access to materials for Dutch Studies increasingly difficult.

==Tenpō Reforms==

As the Tokugawa era drew to a close, a major reform was exerted called the Tenpō Reforms (1841–1843), primarily instituted by Mizuno Tadakuni, a dominant leader in the shogunate. The reforms were economic policies introduced prominently to resolve fiscal issues mainly caused by the Great Tenpō famine, and to revisit more traditional aspects of the Japanese economy. For the samurai, these reforms were meant to spur them to return to their roots of education and military arts. The samurai aimed for change within the status quo itself. There was a stringency amongst all classes of people, and at this time, travel was regulated (especially for farmers, who were meant to remain at home and work their fields) and trade relations crumbled. This, in turn, caused various goods to lower in price. Under Mizuno&#x27;s leadership, the reforms brought about the following: &quot;Moral reform, the encouragement of frugality and retrenchment, recoinage, forced loans from wealthy merchant houses, and the cancellation of samurai debts&quot;. In addition, the bakufu met with fierce objection when land transfers were impressed upon the &quot;daimyōs&quot; in an attempt to reinforce the reach of influence and authority that remained of the Tokugawa government.

Though the reforms largely ended in failure, the introduction of economical change during this period is seen as the initial approach leading ultimately to the modernization of Japan&#x27;s economy.

==Fires at Edo Castle==

Edo Castle was devastated by two fires during the Tenpō era, in 1839 and 1843 respectively, and despite rampant rebellion during this period, neither fire was due to unrest.

==Other events of the &quot;Tenpō&quot; era==

===Calendar revision===
During the Tenpō era, Koide Shuke translated portions of Jérôme Lalande&#x27;s work on astronomy. Koide presented this work to the Astronomy Board as evidence of the superiority of the European calendar, but the effort produced no identifiable effect. However, Koide&#x27;s work and translations of other Western writers did indirectly affect the &quot;Tenpō&quot; calendar revision in 1842–1844. A great many errors had been found in the lunar calendar; and a revised system was publicly adopted in 1844. The new calendar was called the &quot;Tenpō-Jinin&quot; calendar. It was in use in Japan until 1872 when the Gregorian calendar was adopted.

<text>Bran (; ) is a commune in Brașov County, Transylvania, Romania. It is about southwest of the city of Brașov and consists of five villages: Bran, Poarta (), Predeluț (&quot;Kispredeál&quot;), Șimon (&quot;Simon&quot;), and Sohodol (&quot;Szohodol&quot;). 

The medieval Bran Castle is a popular tourist destination, partly because it is associated with the home of Dracula in Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel of the same name; the castle has been listed as one of the Seven Wonders of Romania.

==Geography==
Bran is located in the southern part of Brașov County, on or near the border with Dâmbovița and Argeș counties, and belongs to the historical sub-region of Țara Bârsei (Burzenland). It lies at the northern end of the Rucăr-Bran Pass; national road DN73, which runs through the pass, connects Brașov to Pitești, to the southwest.

The commune is situated between two mountain ranges of the Southern Carpathians: to the southeast are the Bucegi Mountains, with the Omu Peak dominating the area, at ; and to the west are the Piatra Craiului Mountains, which top out at .

==History==
The Teutonic Order began building a wooden fort called &quot;Dietrichstein&quot; here early in the 13th century. After the fort&#x27;s destruction in 1242 by Mongols (&quot;Tatars&quot;), King Sigismund of Hungary ordered a stone castle to be built in 1377, while the settlement of Bran began to develop nearby. Positioned high atop a steep cliff, the castle guarded a strategic trade route between Transylvania and Wallachia. In 1498, Bran came under the jurisdiction of Brașov.

After the Ottoman Empire defeated the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th century, Bran became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and the Principality of Transylvania, which eventually became part of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1804 the commune became part of the Austrian Empire along with the Grand Principality of Transylvania, and in 1867 the Hungarian section of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It became part of the Kingdom of Romania following World War I.

After Transylvania became part of Romania, Bran Castle (that was owned by the city of Brașov) was gifted to Queen Marie by the Brașov magistrate. The queen transformed it into a royal residence in the 1920s, and today it is one of Romania&#x27;s most popular visitor sites. It is open to tourists, who can view the inside alone or as part of a guided tour. Outside the castle is an open-air museum with traditional Romanian farm houses and manufacturing facilities.

<text>Walter de Burgsted was an English judge and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports during the thirteenth century.

In 1262 Walter de Burgsted was given a commission &#x27;to keep the Cinque Ports&#x27;, effectively authorising him control of the South Coast, and charging him with maintaining its defences.

At this time the office of Lord Warden had not been officially established, and such men were known as Keepers of the Coast. He also received the command of Constable of Dover Castle, but the appointments were not made at the same time, having not been merged into one office until after the conclusion of the Second Barons&#x27; War.

<doc id="1057020" wikidata="Q7026467" url="?curid=1057020" title="Nicholas de Crioll">
<text>Nicholas de Crioll (Cryoyll, Kerrial or Kyriel) (died c. February 1272), of a family seated in Kent, was Constable of Dover Castle and Keeper of the Coast during the early 1260s. His kinsman Bertram de Criol (died 1256) had distinguished himself in these offices during the preceding 20 years and both were near predecessors of the eminent Warden of the Cinque Ports, Stephen de Pencester (of Penshurst). 

==Kinship==
Although Nicholas de Crioll is often taken to be (and may well have been) a son of Bertram de Criol, the fact is not overtly stated. In 1242 King Henry granted the manor of Croxton, Leicestershire, to Bertram. The place was of special significance to the king as his father King John&#x27;s heart was buried in Croxton Abbey, and he made many acts of patronage towards it. By 1246 the manor had passed (no doubt in token of a near kinship) to Nicholas de Crioll, who was granted a market and fair there, and the village took its name Croxton Kerrial from the Crioll or Kyriel family&#x27;s connection with it. Bertram de Criol&#x27;s son Sir John de Criol (died 1264) is, however, referred to as his &quot;son and heir&quot;, and John had a younger brother Sir Simon de Criol (died 1267), his fellow-juror in the inquisition upon Thomas de Normanville in 1245-46: Nicholas de Crioll is sometimes in their company as a fellow witness, and is clearly associated with them, but the relationship is not explained.

==Marriage==
Croxton Abbey was a Premonstratensian house, and the tenure of the neighbouring manor by Nicholas de Crioll may be connected with the tradition of patronage towards the Premonstratensians in the family of his wife, Joan de Auberville. She was heir to the senior line of the de Auberville inheritance, only daughter of William de Auberville (the younger), son of Hugh, and grandson of William de Auberville (the elder) and his wife Matilda, daughter of Ranulf de Glanville and Bertha de Valoines. William the elder had assisted Ranulf in the foundation of Leiston Abbey in Suffolk in 1182, and himself founded Langdon Abbey in Kent, near the de Auberville seat of Westenhanger, in 1191, a grant which was confirmed by his fee-lord Simon de Averenches, Lord of Folkestone. Both were Premonstratensian houses. The de Criol family, which in Bertram gave long and distinguished service in the Constabulary of Dover Castle, were patrons also of St Radegund&#x27;s Abbey at Bradsole.

Robert de Auberville (brother of Joan&#x27;s grandfather Hugh), after being among the rebel barons captured by King John at Rochester Castle late in 1215, served King Henry loyally as Constable of Hastings Castle during the 1220s. He was given authority jointly with Bertram de Criol for the defence of the ports between Sandwich and Portsmouth in 1229, and was replaced in that role by Henry de Sandwich (de Sandwico), Warden of Sandwich, in 1230: John de Gatesden, succeeding Robert as Constable of Hastings, then took on a larger command. Joan de Auberville was first married to Henry de Sandwich, and was his widow when she married Nicholas de Crioll. In this way the de Auberville possessions, including Westenhanger, came into the de Crioll family.

==Royal service==
Nicholas is described as &quot;vadlettus&quot;, a royal servant, in orders requiring him to hunt for deer in the park at Clere (Highclere, Hampshire) in 1243, at Guildford in 1244, and at Havering in 1245. The Croxton market grant followed, and in 1248 he received a gift of two does from the park at Elham near Folkestone, from the king. In that year he received a summons for himself and two knights to be in London on 21 August to go into Gascony on the King&#x27;s service. He was in Gascony with Bertram de Criol from Easter 1249 for four months, upon a mission to deliver funds to the viceroy Simon de Montfort.

He was among those who crossed with the king to Gascony in 1253, and again in 1254 in company with his serjeant William de Waleton. His name heads the list of men summoned to Chester on 9 August 1257 for the service of the king and Edward his son in Wales. This assembly was to support King Henry&#x27;s response (which proved ineffectual) to the English defeat at the Battle of Cadfan by the Welsh under Llywelyn ap Gruffudd earlier in the same year. In May 1260 de Crioll appears as Constable of Dover Castle. He was entrusted with the safekeeping of great sums of the King&#x27;s money delivered to him from France by Aubrey de Fiscamp and William de Axemuth, the King&#x27;s clerks. Arrangements were to be made for the delivery of some part of it to the king, for the payment of £1000, and for the safe retention of the remainder at Dover. 

A year later an important ecclesiastical inquisition was held at Otford Palace to determine the true heirs to the estate (sometime considered a barony) of Eynsford, Kent, following the death, in the archbishop&#x27;s wardship, of William de Eynsford the 7th lord. It was claimed in two moieties by Nicholas de Crioll and William Herengod. With the extinction of the descent from William the 5th lord (great-grandfather of the deceased) their claim lay in the descent from his sisters Joan, who married Hugh de Auberville (grandfather of Joan, wife of Nicholas) and Beatrice, who by marriage to Stephen Herengod was mother to the co-claimant. This defeated a counter-claim from an elder branch of the family which had never held seisin, and was decided in favour of de Crioll and Herengod.

==The Second Barons&#x27; War==
In June 1263 the king committed to Nicholas de Crioll the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports, with instructions to Robert de Glastonia, Constable of Dover Castle, to provide him with quarters at the Castle when he should return there. The barons and bailiffs of Dover, Hastings, Romney, Hythe and Sandwich were required &quot;to provide by his counsel two or three of the most approved men for the security and defence of the port[s] by sea and land against any adversaries or rebels.&quot; In September 1263 de Crioll received a mandate to take charge of the county of Kent and the Hundred of Middleton in the absence of a Sheriff, and to deliver the issues for munitions to the Constable of Dover.

At the death of Hamo de Crevecoeur, Lord of the barony of Chatham and of Leeds Castle, early in 1263, Nicholas is shown to have held five knights&#x27; fees from the barony of Folkestone, for which he did service as of the fee of Morteyne. His tenure owed three watches to ward of Dover Castle, and it is recorded that he held from the king &quot;in capite&quot; by barony elsewhere. Hamo held the Folkestone barony in husband-right of his second wife Matilda de Averenches, Lady of Folkestone, who had died c.1250. John de Criol&#x27;s son Bertram (the younger) was married to Eleanor de Crevecoeur (third daughter of Hamo and Matilda), who with her sisters inherited the Folkestone barony.

The de Crioll family was variously involved in the revolt of 1264. Richard de Clare had died in 1262, reputedly in the house of John de Crioll at Bletchingley, and Sir John himself, having been summoned to fight the Welsh in 1263, died not long afterwards. His son Sir Bertram (to whom in February 1264 Roger de Leybourne confirmed the lease of the manor of Dartford) was with Gilbert de Clare in the siege of Rochester Castle, which was held for the king by de Leybourne. An inquisition upon the rebels described Bertram as an enemy of King Henry&#x27;s and King Edward&#x27;s, being of the household of Sir Henry de Montfort, and that certain lands of his were seized by the Earl of Gloucester and afterwards by Roger de Leybourne, but were later redeemed. His kinsman Robert de Crevecoeur, grandson and heir of Hamo, was with Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Lewes. The same inquest records that Laurence de Fonte of Canterbury was with Sir Nicholas de Crioll before, during and after the war, and stayed with him until his death, but it was not believed that he was present at any siege or spoil. In September 1265 Nicholas de Crioll, Knight, was, with John de Chausy (Templar) and Richard de Maneton (Hospitaller) charged with ensuring the safe conduct of the envoys of the King of France into the king&#x27;s presence.

==The second marriage==
After the death of Joan de Auberville Nicholas took a second wife Margery, thought to have been the daughter of Simon de Cray. She must have been a much younger woman, for she had a son and a daughter by Nicholas and four more daughters by a later (Clifford) marriage, and lived down to 1319, when she left a will. The clarification that he was not the husband of Maud, daughter of William de Essetesford (Ashford), as suggested in some sources, is owing to the recognition that the manor of &quot;Stokton&quot; (Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire) was in the possession of Nicholas (and of William Herengod) as a parcel of his inheritance through Joan de Auberville, and not by a previous marriage. Maud&#x27;s first husband was Simon de Crioll (died 1267), the younger brother of John de Crioll: the manor was given by Nicholas and William to Roger de Leybourn, and by him to Maud and her second husband Roger de Rolling.

Nicholas died by 10 February 1272. Wardship of all the lands of the elder Nicholas which were held in chief, and the marriage of his heirs, was granted to Edward the King&#x27;s son on 16 February 1272 and in the March following. Certain lands in Kent were granted in wardship on his son&#x27;s behalf to Sir Gregory de Rokesley, Lord Mayor of London, until Michaelmas 8 Edward I (1280).

==Family==
Nicholas de Crioll married first Joan de Auberville, the widow of Henry de Sandwich. Their son was:

* Nicholas Crioll, who married Margery, daughter of Gilbert Pecche, upon whom (with the assent of his father) he settled the manor of Benhall, Suffolk, in dower for term of her life. This Nicholas died c. 1303, whereupon Margery obtained licence to remarry, and asserted her right in dower. Soon afterwards Ralph le Sauvage and his wife Margery (who alone quitclaimed for herself and her heirs) by fine completed the transfer of the manor of Benhall to Guy Ferre the younger, which had been commenced in 1290 by Nicholas Crioll the younger. Nicholas the younger and Margery had an heir
** Nicholas de Criel, aged nearly 21 in November 1303.

Nicholas de Crioll the elder married secondly Margery, supposed daughter of Simon de Cray. Margery lived to 1319 and left a will. Her children supposed born of her marriage to Nicholas were:
* Bertram de Crioll, with his mother a benefactor of Croxton Abbey. 
* Margery de Crioll, who married John, son of Geoffrey de Say by January 1286/87.

Sir Nicholas de Criel drew up an agreement concerning a marriage at Canterbury in connection with Sir Roger de Leyburne in c. 1261.

==Erasure==
The arms of de Crioll appear in several of the earliest armorial rolls. The shield for Nicholas de Crioll is the one which was erased (presumably on the initiative of Sir Edward Dering) from the heraldic roll of c. 1280 known as the Dering Roll, to make way for Sir Edward&#x27;s suppositious ancestor Richard fitz Dering.

<text>Charles West Churchman (29 August 1913 – 21 March 2004) was an American philosopher and systems scientist, who was Professor at the School of Business Administration and Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. He was internationally known for his pioneering work in operations research, system analysis and ethics.

== Biography ==
Churchman was born in 1913 in Mount Airy, Philadelphia, to Clark Wharton Churchman and Helen Norah Fassitt, descendants of Philadelphia Main Line families. His first intellectual love was for philosophy and this far-ranging love for wisdom captivated him to the end of his life. He studied philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1935, a master&#x27;s in 1936, and a PhD in 1938, all in philosophy. One of his teachers was Edgar A. Singer, who had been a student at Harvard of the philosopher and psychologist William James.

Before completing his dissertation, in 1937, he became Instructor of Philosophy, also at the University of Pennsylvania. Churchman&#x27;s dissertation was ultimately completed under Henry Bradford Smith, titled &quot;Towards a General Logic of Propositions&quot; (1938). Upon finishing his degree, he was appointed assistant professor at the university. During World War II, Churchman headed the mathematical section of the U.S. Ordnance Laboratory at the Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia and devised a way to test small arms ammunition and detonators based on the statistical methods of bioassay. He also investigated the theory of detonation, applying high-speed photography. In 1945, back in Pennsylvania he was elected Chairman of the Department of Philosophy. In 1951, Churchman moved to the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio, and until 1957 he was Professor of Engineering Administration at Case. In 1957, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley and remained there as a Professor Emeritus after his retirement.

During 1946–1954, he served as the secretary and program chairman of the American Philosophy of Science Association. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Churchman was a founding member of TIMS, now INFORMS, and was its ninth president in 1962. In 1989, Churchman was elected president of the International Society for the Systems Sciences.

Churchman edited the journal &quot;Philosophy of Science&quot; for a long period beginning in 1948. He was also the first editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Management Science&quot; in 1954.

Churchman has been cited by Noam Chomsky as the only professor from whom he learned anything as an undergraduate. European students of C. West Churchman are Werner Ulrich and Kristo Ivanov who developed his work in related fields and contributed to its diffusion in Europe. American students of Churchman who have documented their understanding and application of his work are Ian Mitroff and Richard O. Mason 

Churchman died in 2004 in Bolinas, California.

== Work ==
Churchman made significant contributions in the fields of management science, operations research and systems theory. During a career spanning six decades, Churchman investigated a vast range of topics such as accounting, research and development management, city planning, education, mental health, space exploration, and peace and conflict studies.

Churchman became internationally recognized due to his then radical concept of incorporating ethical values into operating systems. Hasan Ozbekhan, his friend, in &quot;The Predicament of Mankind&quot; proposal to the Club of Rome incorporated ethical values in the 49 Continuous Critical Problems that constitute the Global Problematique. The proposal was not accepted because it was &quot;too humanistic&quot; 

== Personal life ==
His wife Gloria Churchman died in 2009. About her husband, she said, &quot;Academic philosophy wasn&#x27;t satisfying to him. He demanded that philosophy have meaning in the world. He wanted to insert an ethical dimension into science. And he really made it his job to remind all these CEOs that they had ethical responsibilities.&quot;

&quot;He was a tremendous teacher. People would flock to his class,&quot; Gloria Churchman said. &quot;He always kept you on the edge of your chair, because he was a very, very exciting lecturer. He had students from everywhere, all over the world.&quot;

Professor Churchman and Gloria Churchman are survived by their son Daniel Wharton Churchman (Josh) of Bolinas, his daughter-in-law Joy Churchman and two grandchildren, Jenna and Kyle Churchman.

== Recognition ==

Churchman&#x27;s honors include the Academy of Management’s Best Book in Management Award and the McKinsey Book Award, both in 1968. In 1965 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. His work was further honored through three honorary doctorates given to him by the Washington University in St. Louis in 1975, the University of Lund, Sweden in 1984, and the Umeå University, Sweden in 1986. In 1983, Churchman received the Berkeley Citation, one of the campus&#x27;s highest awards. In 1999 he received the LEO Award for Lifetime Exceptional Achievement in Information Systems.
He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.

The West Churchman Memorial Prize was awarded in 2014, during the 10th Brazilian Congress of systems, conducted by CORS - USP, after a selection carried out by an editorial committee, composed of researchers from several countries. The purpose of it was to provide recognition to an important systemic research work developed within the highest ethical and methodological standards as advocated C. West Churchman.

<text>Originally, Trio Los Panchos were a &quot;trío romántico&quot; formed in New York City in 1944 by Alfredo Gil, Chucho Navarro, and the Puerto Rican Hernando Avilés. The trio became one of the leading exporters of the bolero and the romantic ballad in Latin America. 

The group sold hundreds of millions of records since its creation in the mid 1940s, some of their best known songs being their interpretations of classic folk songs such as &quot;Besame Mucho&quot;, &quot;Sabor a Mí&quot;, &quot;Sin Ti&quot;, &quot;Solamente Una Vez&quot;, &quot;Contigo&quot;, &quot;Quizas, Quizas, Quizas&quot;, &quot;Contigo Aprendi&quot;, &quot;Aquellos Ojos Verdes&quot;, &quot;Cuando vuelva a tu lado&quot;, &quot;Se te olvida&quot;, &quot;El Reloj&quot;, &quot;Noche de Ronda&quot;, &quot;Rayito de Luna&quot;.

Los Panchos are regarded as one of the top musical trios of all time and one of the most influential Latin American artists of all time. They sold out concerts around the globe for over 70 years and have appeared in more than 50 films. 

A characteristic instrument of Los Panchos and other Mexican &quot;tríos románticos&quot; since the 1950s is the requinto guitar, which is smaller and tuned higher than a standard guitar. Requinto solos are found in many bolero recordings by Los Panchos.

==History==
Los Panchos first met in 1944 in New York City. The three original members were Chucho Navarro, and Alfredo Gil, both from Mexico, and Hernando Avilés from Puerto Rico. All three played guitar and contributed vocally.

Los Panchos reached fame with their romantic songs, especially in Latin America where they are still regarded as one of the top trios of all time. They sold millions of records in Latin America and other countries. In the 1940s they collaborated with Alfredo Antonini&#x27;s Viva America Orchestra with the orchestral accordionist John Serry Sr. in a recording of &quot;La Palma&quot; (a cueca) and &quot;Rosa Negra&quot; (a conga) for Pilotone Records (#45 5067, #45 5069). They also appeared in around 50 movies, mostly during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.

By 1946, the trio&#x27;s exceptional virtuosity and authenticity had attracted the attention of Edmund Chester at CBS Radio&#x27;s Cadena de Las Americas (Network of the Americas). Los Panchos were immediately invited to perform as &quot;musical ambassadors&quot; on the network&#x27;s &quot;Viva América&quot; program to support cultural diplomacy in twenty countries throughout Latin America and South America. 

Los Panchos began touring internationally in 1946 and would relocate later that same year to Mexico City. They were welcomed with open arms and &quot;XEW-AM&quot;, the most popular radio station in Mexico City, reserved a time slot for their music. In 1951, Los Panchos launched another international tour across Latin America. Julito Rodríguez joined the group in 1952; he was replaced by Johnny Albino in 1958. 

In 1964, CBS proposed to the members of the trio, then made up of the two founding members and Johnny Albino, to accompany a female voice for the first time, the American vocalist of Judeo-Spanish descent Eydie Gormé, who had several years of recording experience in the United States and who was just beginning to record in Spanish. The collaboration between Gormé and Los Panchos resulted in a series of bestselling albums in the 1960s such as Great Love Songs In Spanish (titled Amor, in Spanish). The Albino era was one of the most prosperous ones for Los Panchos, and classic albums from that time are still very popular among Los Panchos fans. His departure in 1968 was a tumultuous one, as he did not leave on good terms with the group&#x27;s management. 

In 1971, Ovidio Hernández joined the band as lead vocalist, a part he would fulfill until his untimely passing from complications of meningitis in 1976. Following him, Rafael Basurto Lara joined as lead singer.

Alfredo Gil played with Los Panchos until his retirement in 1981; he died in 1999. Chucho Navarro played with the group until his death in 1993. Currently the trio using the Los Panchos name is the Trio Los Panchos de Chucho Navarro Fundador (&quot;Trio Los Panchos of Founder Chucho Navarro&quot;) under the direction of Chucho Navarro Jr., the son of original Los Panchos member Chucho Navarro.

<text>Abnormality (or dysfunctional behavior or maladaptive behavior or deviant behavior) is a behavioral characteristic assigned to those with conditions that are regarded as dysfunctional. Behavior is considered to be abnormal when it is atypical or out of the ordinary, consists of undesirable behavior, and results in impairment in the individual&#x27;s functioning. As applied to humans, abnormality may also encompass deviance, which refers to behavior that is considered to transgress social norms. The definition of abnormal behavior in humans is an often debated issue in abnormal psychology.

&quot;Abnormal&quot; behavior should not be confused with &quot;unusual&quot; behavior. Behavior that is out of the ordinary is not necessarily indicative of a mental or psychological disorder. Abnormal behavior, on the other hand, while not a mental disorder in itself, is often an indicator of a possible mental and/or psychological disorder. A psychological disorder is defined as an &quot;ongoing dysfunctional pattern of thought, emotion, and behavior that causes significant distress, and is considered deviant in that person&#x27;s culture or society&quot;. Abnormal behavior, as it relates to psychological disorders, would be &quot;ongoing&quot; and a cause of &quot;significant distress&quot;. A mental disorder describes a patient who has a medical condition whereby the medical practitioner makes a judgment that the patient is exhibiting abnormal behavior based on the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&quot; (DSM-5) criteria. Thus, simply because a behavior is unusual it does not make it abnormal; it is only considered abnormal if it meets these criteria. The DSM-5 is used by both researchers and clinicians in diagnosing a potential mental disorder. The criteria needed to be met in the DSM-5 vary for each mental disorder.

Unlike physical abnormalities in one&#x27;s health where symptoms are objective, psychology health professionals cannot use objective symptoms when evaluating someone for abnormalities in behavior.

==Several conventional criteria==
There are five main criteria of abnormality. They are:
# Statistical Criterion
# Social Criterion
# Personal Discomfort (Distress)
# Maladaptive Behavior
# Deviation from Ideal

Abnormal behaviors are &quot;actions that are unexpected and often evaluated negatively because they differ from typical or usual behavior&quot;.

The following criteria are subjective:
* Maladaptive and malfunctional behaviors: behaviors, which, due to circumstance, are not fully adapted to the environment. Instead, they become malfunctional and detrimental to the individual, or others. For example, a mouse continuing to attempt to escape when escape is obviously impossible.
* Behavior that violates the standards of society. When people do not follow the conventional social and moral rules of their society, the behavior is considered to be abnormal.
* Observer discomfort. If a person&#x27;s behavior brings discomfort to those in observation, it is likely to be considered abnormal.

The standard criteria in psychology and psychiatry is that of mental illness or mental disorder. Determination of abnormality in behavior is based upon medical diagnosis.

Other criteria include:
* Statistical infrequency: statistically rare behaviors are called abnormal. Though not always the case, the presence of abnormal behavior in people is usually rare or statistically unusual. Any specific abnormal behavior may be unusual, but it is not uncommon for people to exhibit some form of prolonged abnormal behavior at some point in their lives.
* Deviation from social norms: behavior that is deviant from social norms is defined as the departure or deviation of an individual from society&#x27;s unwritten rules (norms). For example, if one were to witness a person jumping around, nude, on the streets, the person would likely be perceived as abnormal to most people, as they have broken society&#x27;s norms about wearing clothing. There are also a number of criteria for one to examine before reaching a judgment as to whether someone has deviated from society&#x27;s norms:
** Culture: what may be seen as normal in one culture, may be seen as abnormal in another.
** Situation &amp; context one is placed in: for example, going to the toilet is a normal human act, but going in the middle of a supermarket would be most likely seen as highly abnormal, i.e., defecating or urinating in public is illegal as a misdemeanor act of indecent public conduct.
** Age: a child at the age of three could get away with taking off clothing in public, but not a person at the age of twenty.
** Gender: a male responding with behavior normally reacted to as female, and vice versa, is often likely to be seen as abnormal or deviant from social norms. 
** Historical context: standards of normal behavior change in some societies--sometimes very rapidly.
* Failure to function adequately: behavior that is abnormal. These criteria are necessary to label an abnormality as a disorder, if the individual is unable to cope with the demands of everyday life. Psychologists can disagree on the boundaries that define what is &#x27;functioning&#x27; and what is &#x27;adequately&#x27;, however, as some behaviors that can cause &#x27;failure to function&#x27; are not seen as bad. For example, firefighters risking their lives to save people in a blazing fire may be ‘failing to function’ in the fact that they are risking their lives, and in another context, their actions could be construed as pathological, but within the context of being a firefighter said risks are not at odds with adequate functioning.
* Deviation from ideal mental health: defines abnormality by determining if the behavior the individual is displaying is affecting their mental well-being. As with the failure to function definition, the boundaries that stipulate what &#x27;ideal mental health&#x27; is are not clearly defined. A frequent problem with the definition is that all individuals at some point in their life deviate from ideal mental health, but it does not mean the behavior is abnormal. For example, someone who has lost a relative is distressed and deviates from &quot;ideal mental health&quot; for a time, but their distress is not defined as abnormal, as distress is an expected reaction.

A common approach to defining abnormality is a multi-criteria approach, where all definitions of abnormality are used to determine whether an individual&#x27;s behavior is abnormal. For example, psychologists would be prepared to define an individual&#x27;s behavior as &quot;abnormal&quot; if the following criteria are met:
* The individual is engaging in behavior that is preventing them from functioning.
* The individual is engaging in behavior that breaks a social norm.
* The individual is engaging in behavior that is statistically infrequent.

A good example of an abnormal behavior assessed by a multi-criteria approach is depression: it is commonly seen as a deviation from ideal mental stability, it often stops the individual from &#x27;functioning&#x27; in normal life, and, although it is a relatively common mental disorder, it is still statistically infrequent. Most people do not experience significant major depressive disorder in their lifetime. Thus, depression and its associated behaviors would be considered abnormal.

== Controversy ==
There is some debate among professionals as to what constitutes abnormal behavior. In general, abnormal behavior is often classified under one of the &quot;four D&#x27;s,&quot; which are deviance, dysfunction, distress, and danger. The four D&#x27;s, as well as the criterion mentioned above, are widely used to diagnose behavior as abnormal. However, the labeling of behaviors as abnormal can be controversial because abnormality is often subjective and what is considered abnormal changes over time. For example, before 1974, homosexuality was considered to be a mental disorder in the DSM. After activist movements and examination within the APA, it was replaced with sexual orientation disturbance, then eventually completely removed from the DSM. Now, the APA and the medical community consider homosexuality normal when it was formerly considered abnormal. Social constructs and culture are often determiners of what is normal and what is abnormal.

Additionally, abnormality in behavior does not necessarily indicate dysfunction. For example, one of the four D&#x27;s of abnormal behavior is deviance, meaning that the behavior observed is not in alignment with what is the social or cultural norm. This may not imply that the behavior is dysfunctional or undesirable, however--it may simply mean that what is being observed is statistically deviant in a social or cultural context. In fact, deviance can often be positive and accepted by others. This is commonly seen in individuals such as Nobel Prize winners, geniuses, professional athletes, and extremely creative people.

<text>Delphine Software International was a French video game developer. They were famous for publishing &quot;Another World&quot; and creating the cinematic platform game &quot;Flashback&quot;, which bore a similarity to &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, both in gameplay and in its use of rotoscoped animation. They were also known for their &quot;Moto Racer&quot; series.

==History==
Delphine Software International (DSI) was created in 1988 as a part of the Delphine Group and was initially based in Paris. It was headed by Paul de Senneville, and co-directed by Paul Cuisset, who was the company lead designer.

In 1993, a subsidiary company named Adeline Software International was created. In 2001, DSI&quot; &quot;relocated to Saint-Ouen. In December 2002, the company was removed from the Delphine Group. In February 2003, Delphine Software was sold to French game development company Doki Denki. Doki Denki closed down in July 2004 after bankruptcy and liquidation. Their official website has since shut down. As a consequence, Adeline also shut down around the same time.

* Christian Perring points out that ″the book contains answers to just about every sexual question″ the readers of &quot;The Guide to Getting it On&quot; ″ever had″. He criticizes, however, that the readers of the book might have trouble in finding the answers to their questions.

<text>Wee Waa () is a town located on the north-western slopes of the New England region in New South Wales, Australia. The town is within the Narrabri Shire local government area and is on the Namoi River. Wee Waa is north-west of Narrabri and northwest of Sydney on the Kamilaroi Highway. At the , Wee Waa had a population of 2,034. 

Wee Waa is 42 kilometres from the Newell Highway, and is referred to as a gateway to the far west centres of Walgett, Collarenebri, Lightning Ridge opal fields and beyond.

The Aboriginal meaning of Wee Waa is &quot;Fire for Roasting&quot; from the language of the Kamilaroi people. The town is known to be the &quot;Cotton Capital of Australia&quot; as a rural community situated in the rich agricultural heartland of the Lower Namoi Valley in NSW. The town services a far greater rural community as well as the villages of Burren Junction, Pilliga and Gwabegar.

The town is situated approximately above sea level.

==History==

Before the arrival of European settlers, the Wee Waa area was inhabited by the Gamilaraay/Kamilaroi Aboriginal people.

The Wee Waa run was taken up by squatter George Hobler in 1837 and the settlement developed. It became an administrative centre in the late 1840s. A police station and court of petty sessions were established in 1847 and a post office opened two years later. It is the oldest established town in the area and is the birthplace of the commercial cotton industry in Australia.

Rail services were extended in 1901 from Narrabri to Walgett, passing through the town.

The first commercial cotton plantation was established in 1961, irrigated with water from the Keepit Dam on the Namoi River.

It was the first town built on the Namoi River. The town is subject to regular floods and is protected by a levee bank. However thousands of people were isolated on properties around Wee Waa in February 2012.

==Environment==

===Natural===

The Wee Waa district has a mean summer minimum temperature of and a maximum of . Mean winter temperatures range from to . Mean annual rainfall is , falling on 80 days of the year.

The town and surrounding area have often been flooded by the Namoi River, which can require supplies to be flown in by helicopter.

The town has two motels, four schools, a preschool, Nurruby Wee Waa Early Education Service, two hotels and two caravan parks as well as eating-places, a public swimming pool, a nine-hole golf course, bowling club, tennis courts, a modern sporting complex, a hostel for the aged and a new medical centre.

Wee Waa is serviced by NSW TrainLink rail services, interstate coaches, and daily air services offered through Narrabri.

==Notable events==

In 1973 Arthur Murray led the Aboriginal cotton-chippers on strike for better pay and working conditions. The Wee Waa Echo called them &quot;radicals and professional troublemakers&quot;, adding that &quot;it is not fanciful to see the Aboriginal problem as the powder keg for Communist aggression in Australia&quot;.

It was in Wee Waa police station that rugby player Eddie Murray died in 1981, one of the Aboriginal deaths in custody that prompted a Royal Commission to be set up. It was also the first town in Australia to use DNA testing to find a rapist.

On 17 May 2013 at the 79th Annual Wee Waa Show, Columbia Records held the global launch party for the French electronic music duo Daft Punk&#x27;s album &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;. This caused much excitement in the town and it attracted an estimated 2,500 tourists. It was initially believed that footage recorded from the event would be used for a music video; however, this did not come to fruition.

==Sport==
The town has a multi-function Sports Complex, which also acts as a &quot;de facto&quot; community centre.

The most popular sport in Wee Waa is rugby league, the name of the town&#x27;s club is the Wee Waa Panthers. The Panthers compete in the Group 4 Rugby League competition, which is based in the areas surrounding Tamworth. The club&#x27;s most famous export is Jamie Lyon. A club junior, Lyon famously left his professional career with the Parramatta Eels to return for a season with the Wee Waa Panthers. The first-grade team went on to win that year (2004) against Moree, 55 to 12. Lyon returned to professional football with St Helens for two years to play in the European Super League. Following this, Lyon played for the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles playing from 2007 to 2016, winning a premiership in 2008 and 2011.

The local soccer club is the Wee Waa United Football Club. In 2019, the club won the Namoi Premier League beating Narrabri FC 2-1 in extra time. The game was broadcast across the state on BarTV.

Wee Waa produced Andrew Curry, the former Australian Olympic javelin athlete and the nation&#x27;s leading javelin specialist in the 1990s.
Curry competed at two Olympic games; Atlanta 1996 &amp; Sydney 2000. Additionally, Curry competed in three Commonwealth Games: 1994 Victoria, 1998 Kuala Lumpur, and 2002 Manchester.

Wee Waa is known for its large population of southern blue-tip yabbies. On 4 September 1995, Eric Gordon set the Australian record, catching a specimen that measured 47cm.

==History==

=== 1923 ===
Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium commercialises the production of insulin.

=== 1982–1994 ===

The company established its presence in the United States in 1982 and Canada in 1984.

In 1986, Novo Industri A/S acquired the Ferrosan Group, now named as &quot;Novo Nordisk Pharmatech A/S.&quot;

In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world&#x27;s largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen.

In 1991, Novo Nordisk Engineering (now NNE A/S) demerged after working as in-house consultants at Novo Nordisk for years, to provide standard engineering services (end-to-end engineering) to pharma manufacturing companies.

In 1994, Novo Nordisk&#x27;s existing information technology units was spun out as NNIT A/S. The company was converted into a wholly owned &quot;aktieselskab&quot; in 2004 In March 2015, NNIT was floated on the Nasdaq Nordic.

=== 2000–2018 ===
Novo&#x27;s enzymes business, Novozymes A/S, was spun-out in 2000.
Novo acquired Xellia for $700 million in 2013.

The same year, Novo Nordisk USA moved into new headquarters offices in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey, by way of extensively renovating abandoned premises. This action served to consolidate several facilities that the company had previously had in Plainsboro.

In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.

In January 2018, Reuters reported that Novo had offered to acquire Ablynx for $3.1 billion - having made an unreported offer in mid-December for the company. However, the Ablynx board rejected this offer the same day, explaining that the price undervalued the business. Ultimately Novo lost out to Sanofi who bid $4.8 billion. Later, in the same year, the company announced it would acquire Ziylo for around $800 million.

=== 2020–present ===
In March 2020, Novo volunteers started testing samples for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-qPCR equipment in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic to increase available test capacity. In June, the business announced it would acquire AstraZeneca&#x27;s spin-off Corvidia Therapeutics for an initial sum of $725 million (up to a performance-related maximum of $2.1 billion), boosting its presence in cardiovascular diseases. In November, the company announced it would acquire Emisphere Technologies for $1.8 billion, gaining control of a pill-based treatment for diabetes. In December, Novo announced it would acquire Emisphere Technologies for $1.35 billion.

In November 2021, Novo announced it would acquire Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and its RNAi therapeutics, for $3.3 billion ($38.25 per share).

In September 2022, Novo agreed to acquire Forma Therapeutics for $1.1 billion with the intent to expand its sickle cell disease and rare blood disorders portfolio.

By 2022 the popularity of Novo&#x27;s Wegovy and Ozempic for weight loss was so great as to significantly increase growth of the entire economy of Denmark. Two-thirds of Denmark&#x27;s overall economic growth in 2022 was attributed to the pharmaceutical industry.

The company&#x27;s profits increased by 45% year over year in the first half of 2023. Most of the growth occurred from its weight loss drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic, which accounted for 55% of the company&#x27;s 2023 revenue. 

In August 2023, Novo agreed to acquire the Montreal-headquartered pharmaceutical company, Inversago Pharma for $1 billion and Embark Biotech for up to $500 million. In October 2023, the company announced it would acquire ocedurenone—an experimental drug for uncontrolled hypertension and potentially beneficial in treating cardiovascular and kidney diseases—from KBP Biosciences for $1.3 billion. After a failed clinical trial the following year, Novo Nordisk initiated legal action against KBP alleging that the company misrepresented the drug&#x27;s effectiveness by concealing unfavorable clinical trial data. Seeking up to $830 million in damages, the Singapore International Commercial Court granted Novo Nordisk&#x27;s request for a freeze on KBP&#x27;s assets and those of its founder, Huang Zhenhua.

In November 2023, Novo Nordisk announced investment of €2.1 billion in a French production facility to increase the production capacity and manufacturing of its popular anti-obesity medication.

In February 2024, parent company Novo Holdings A/S agreed to acquire Catalent for $16.5billion. On completion, Novo Nordisk said it would acquire three manufacturing facilities from its parent for $11billion to scale up production to meet the massive demand for Wegovy and Ozempic.

In March 2024 Novo Nordisk reached a $604 billion market capitalization and became the 12th most valuable company in the world. The company&#x27;s stock jumped to a record high after early trial data showed positive results for its new experimental weight loss pill amycretin. The company also announced it would acquire Cardior Pharmaceuticals and its cardiovascular disease portfolio for up to $1.1 billion. 

As of April 2024, the flow of cash from Novo Nordisk&#x27;s weight-loss drugs was continuing to solidify its status as the most valuable company in Europe, to the point that economists were worried that Denmark might come down with Dutch disease (that is, a country that does only one thing well and nothing else). The company&#x27;s market capitalization of $570 billion remained larger than the entire economy of Denmark, its $2.3 billion income tax bill for 2023 made it the largest taxpayer in the country, and its rapid growth was driving nearly all of the expansion of Denmark&#x27;s economy. The company had started to move away from its traditional focus on diabetes care towards a more ambitious mission to &quot;defeat serious chronic diseases&quot;, and towards that end, hired over 10,000 people in 2023 alone. To effectively manage the rapid expansion of its workforce while maintaining its traditional corporate culture, the Novo Nordisk Way, the company put over 400 senior executives through a leadership development program called NNX, which stands for Novo Nordisk Next. 

In May 2024, the company announced it would acquire Austrian fluid management service business, Single Use Support.

In June 2024 the company announced plans to build a new production plant in Clayton, North Carolina, at a cost of $4.1 billion. It will be the company&#x27;s fourth in the state of North Carolina and used for production of semaglutide products Ozempic and Wegovy. The company also announced plans to acquire US-based Catalent in to increase production supply.

As of October 2024, Novo Nordisk was the second most valuable drug company in the world by market capitalization, second only to its archrival Eli Lilly and Company.

Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN (United Nations) resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease along with HIV / AIDS that the UN has a commitment to combat.

Diabetic treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk&#x27;s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers. This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to British findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualised person-focused care in the United Kingdom. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to a diabetic treatment for patients and their families.

The i3-diabetes programme is a collaboration between the King&#x27;s Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.

==Diabetic support advocacy==

Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation&#x27;s Unite for Diabetes campaign.

In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.

A November 2014 newspaper article, suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex, but also that Novo Nordisk&#x27;s mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance &quot;...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that&#x27;d be fine.&quot;

In September 2023, Novo Nordisk and UNICEF announced a multi-year expansion of their collaboration to address childhood overweight and obesity.

In October 2024, Novo Nordisk published a study on scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; about a novel glucose-sensitive insulin NNC2215 that can reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in animal models.

==Research and pipeline==

Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies. In September 2014, the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&amp;D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

In September 2018, it was reported that the company would lay off 400 administrative staff, laboratory technicians and scientists, in Denmark and China in order to concentrate research and development efforts on “transformational biological and technological innovation”.

==Controversies==
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the code of conduct for Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorisation.

In 2013, Novo Nordisk had to pay back billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.

In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetic medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.

In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.

In September 2017, Novo Nordisk agreed to pay $58.7 million to end a United States Department of Justice probe into the lack of FDA disclosure to doctors about the cancer risk for their diabetic drug, Victoza.

In March 2023, Novo Nordisk was suspended from the ABPI for a period of two years, for engaging in misleading marketing practices that amounted to &quot;bribing health professionals with inducement to prescribe&quot;. This is only the eighth time in the last 40 years that ABPI sanctioned a member organization. Consequently, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Physicians ended their corporate partnerships as it would be in breach of their ethical guidance. The Novo Nordisk UK General Manager, Pinder Sahota, chose to resign as President of the ABPI prior to the suspension.

On February 2, 2024 The United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that 55 lawsuits pending in federal courts be consolidated into a multidistrict litigation. The majority of the cases were against Novo Nordisk, but some were brought against Eli Lilly. The Ozempic Lawsuits allege gastroparesis ileus and other injuries caused by GLP-1 RAS. The Case is known as MDL No. 3094 In Re: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RAS) Products Liability Litigation. As of August 6, 2024 there were 235 active Ozempic lawsuits.

In 2024 Novo Nordisk drug pricing in the US has been a target of lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders and the Senate committee Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP). The committee investigation found Novo Nordisk&#x27;s drug Ozempic priced for $969 per month in the US, compared to $155 in Canada and $59 in Germany. Its weight-loss drug Wegovy is priced for $1,349 per month in the US compared to $140 in Germany and $92 in the UK. In July 2024, US President Joe Biden joined Sanders in stating &quot;Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly must stop ripping off Americans with high drug prices.&quot;

In September 2024, CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen was summoned to testify to the US Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee at a hearing in Washington DC. During the hearing Senator Bernie Sanders told the Novo Nordisk CEO, &quot;Stop Ripping Us Off.&quot;
==Sponsorships and pitchpeople==
Novo Nordisk has sponsored athletes with diabetes, such as Charlie Kimball in auto racing and Team Novo Nordisk in road cycling.

As of the 2010s, Anthony Anderson (star of &quot;Black-ish&quot;) serves as a pitchman for Novo Nordisk, and featured in the company&#x27;s television advertisements which aired in the US.

<doc id="1057065" wikidata="Q660378" url="?curid=1057065" title="Ariete">
<text>The C1 Ariete () is a 3rd generation main battle tank of the Italian Army, developed by Consorzio Iveco Oto Melara (CIO), a consortium formed by IVECO and OTO Melara. The chassis and engine were produced by Iveco, while the turret and fire-control system were supplied by OTO Melara. The vehicle carries the latest optical and digital-imaging and fire-control systems, enabling it to fight day and night and to fire on the move. Six prototypes were developed by 1988, which were subject to intensive testing. The following year the vehicles travelled a combined 16,000 km. Deliveries were first planned for 1993, and took place in 1994 due to delays. Final delivery occurred 7 years later in August 2002.

==Design==
The tank has a conventional layout similar to other Western MBTs: a driver located at the front of the hull, the fighting compartment towards the middle, and the engine compartment in the rear of the hull.

===Armament===
The Ariete&#x27;s main armament is 120 mm smoothbore gun, designed by OTO Breda, similar to the Rheinmetall L/44. The gun fires most NATO-standard rounds of the same calibre. It carries 42 rounds, 15 ready rounds are stored vertically on the left side of the main gun breech. The other 27 are stowed in a hull rack to the left of the driver&#x27;s station. The gun barrel has a thermal insulating sleeve and a fume extractor; it is fully stabilized in both azimuth and elevation by an electro-hydraulic drive system.

Secondary armament consists of a 7.62 mm MG 42/59 coaxial machine gun operated by the tank gunner or commander and an additional 7.62 mm MG 42/59 configured as an anti-aircraft weapon operated by the main-gun loader from his hatch.

===Fire control and target acquisition===
The tank&#x27;s advanced fire-control system, manufactured by Galileo Avionica, is designated OG14L3 TURMS, and includes day and night panoramic capability for the commander&#x27;s SP-T-694 primary sight (developed collaboratively by SFIM/Galileo), a stabilized platform including a thermal gunner&#x27;s sight and a laser rangefinder to increase accuracy and expedite target detection and targeting, and a digital fire-control computer, which is capable of measuring wind speed, humidity, and exterior weather conditions, combining them with the turret&#x27;s angle of elevation, attitude, and the barrel&#x27;s physical wear to increase accuracy. 

This computer is also a component of the tank&#x27;s navigation system and allows for the exchange of tactical information between vehicles in a network. The Ariete has a &quot;hunter-killer&quot; capability in which the commander spots and designates targets for the gunner in a 360° field of vision around the vehicle without changing his position or having to open the turret hatch for visual identification of targets. The commander&#x27;s sight also has a vertical traverse from –10° to +60° from the horizontal, which allows the tank to engage low-flying airborne threats—primarily helicopters. During night fighting, the commander and gunner both share the thermal sight which is able to resolve a 2.3×x2.3 m target from a distance of 1,500 m.

===Crew and tank protection===
The Ariete&#x27;s armour is a steel and composite blend, the turret front shape is similar to the British Challenger 1 and the American M1 Abrams.

The Ariete features two side-mounted, electronically fired GALIX 80mm grenade launchers. Each launcher consists of four 80 mm barrels which can be intermixed with either smoke or chaff grenades. The smoke grenades are capable of shrouding the tank from visual or thermal detection, while the chaff grenades disperse the tank&#x27;s radar cross section. The tank is fully NBC protected.

===Powerplant and drivetrain===
The Ariete is powered by a 25.8-litre Fiat-Iveco MTCA turbo-diesel V12 rated at at 2,300 rpm, with a maximum torque of at 1,600 rpm driving through a ZF LSG3000 automatic transmission, with four forward gears and two reverse, allowing for a top cruising speed of 65 km/h and a 0–32 km/h acceleration in 6 seconds. The computer-controlled transmission allows it to climb grades rated up to 60%, and can ford waterways of up to 1.25 m on-the-fly. The entire engine and transmission assembly can be replaced in under 1 hour.

The Ariete&#x27;s independent suspension system consists of 14 torsion bars with suspension arms, 10 hydraulic shock absorbers (installed on roadwheels numbers 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), and 14 friction dampers.

The tracks were supplied by KNDS Tracks.

==History==
===Further development===
During the first years of adoption, the Ariete MBT showed some deficiencies regarding the powerplant. While the original V12 1,250 hp FIAT-Iveco MTCA (Modular Turbo-Charged Aftercooler) was a coupling of two of the V6 engines used by several Italian Army vehicles such as the B1 Centauro tank destroyer and the Dardo IFV, it produced less power than the most advanced contemporary western designs. The Ariete&#x27;s engine had to run at a high RPM to perform well, thus reducing the operating time between failures.

Moreover, to retain a good power-to-weight ratio, the total weight of the tank had to be kept below 60 tonnes. The relatively light weight of the Ariete helped lower consumption and facilitated the transport and mobility of the MBT (especially over bridges). This was obtained partially at the expense of the thickness of the armour that, only partially compensated by the good ballistic shape of the vehicle, raised some doubt about its ability to survive in the harshest environments.

As an improvement, Iveco developed a new version of the MTCA engine. The stroke was lengthened, increasing displacement to 30 litres, with a new common rail direct fuel injection system along a new double turbocharger, increasing power output to at 1,800 rpm (with an electronically reduced torque of 5,500 N·m, maintained from 1,100 to 1,800 rpm to reduce damage to the transmission) and further reducing fuel consumption. The new engine had to be adopted during the first general revision of the existing vehicles, but seems to have been blocked by technical and financial problems. As for the armour, Oto Melara developed two different sets (with different thickness levels, depending upon mission nature) of adjunctive armour, shown for the first time at Eurosatory 2002.

=== Ariete C2 ===
In the early 2000s, the Italian Army was interested in developing a new version of Ariete (C2 Ariete or Ariete Mk. 2 designations were considered) which would enter service over the following years with the planned acquisition of 300 units. Budget limitations drastically reduced the number of improved Ariete (order reduced to 200) and eventually caused the subsequent cancellation of the program. The planned improvements were therefore to be applied to the C1 Ariete during the future major revisions.

In 2023, a contract was signed to modernise the Ariete to the C2 standard for a value of €848.8 million. The modernisation will take place on 90 tanks, with an option for 35 additional ones. It includes the following modifications:

* Mobility:
** New engine: Iveco Vector 12 with a power of and a torque of This engine shares parts with the Iveco Vector 8V engine of the Centauro II, which will improve the logistics of the Italian Army.
** Transmission LSG-3000 updated to take the added power
** Widened tracks for higher mobility

* Turret modifications (using most of the elements of the Centauro II): 
** The hydraulic drives are replaced by electric drives. This will reduce the fire risks, and improve the accuracy of the fire control system when in movement.
** Ballistic computer replaced
** Sights: 
*** Commander: Leonardo ATTILA-D, a multi-spectral panoramic observation device
*** Gunner: Leonardo LOTHAR-SD sight
* Protection:
** An improved mine protection kit (MPK)
** Two armour packages:
*** PSO light which improves the side protection against RPG.
*** PSO plus
** Improved fire-fighting system
* Other changes:
** Communication systems replaced by systems from Leonardo, a VQ-1 SDR radio, a Larimart intercom, and the C2 C2N Evo command system.
** Pintle mount for a M2 Browning for self-defence against drones
** minor improvements on the fuel tanks, bilge pumps, heating and NBC systems

CIO-Oto Melara planned to offer the opening of a production line in Brazil at its Sete Lagoas plant, where the LMV is already produced and the Centauro II will be produced for the Brazilian Army. However, the &quot;Army Strategic Program Armored Forces&quot;, which would provide 65 MBTs for the Brazilian Army, limits contenders to a maximum weight of 50 tonnes, which rules out the Ariete unless changes were made to Brazilian technical requirements.

==Operators==

Each tank battalion fields three tank companies with thirteen Ariete each and two Ariete for the battalion commander and the deputy commander.

<doc id="1057067" wikidata="Q7852854" url="?curid=1057067" title="Tunbridge ware">
<text>Tunbridge ware is a form of decoratively inlaid woodwork, typically in the form of boxes, that is characteristic of Tonbridge and the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent in the 18th and 19th centuries. The decoration typically consists of a mosaic of many very small pieces of different coloured woods that form a pictorial vignette. Shaped rods and slivers of wood were first carefully glued together, then cut into many thin slices of identical pictorial veneer with a fine saw. Elaborately striped and feathered bandings for framing were pre-formed in a similar fashion.

There is a collection of Tunbridge ware in the Tunbridge Wells Museum and Art Gallery in Tunbridge Wells.

==History==
The famous makers of Tunbridge ware were in the Tunbridge Wells area of Kent; their most notable work was from about 1830 to 1900.

Early makers of Tunbridge ware, in Tunbridge Wells in the mid 18th century, were the Burrows family, and Fenner and Co. In the 19th century, around 1830, James Burrows invented a technique of creating mosaics from wooden tesserae. Henry Hollamby, apprenticed to the Burrows family, set up on his own in 1842 and became an important manufacturer of Tunbridge ware, employing about 40 people.
Edmund Nye (1797–1863) and his father took over the Fenner company when William Fenner retired in 1840, after 30 years in partnership with him. Thomas Barton (1819–1903), previously apprenticed at the Wise factory, joined the Nyes in 1836, and worked as Nye&#x27;s designer; he took over the business in 1863 and continued there until his death.

In Tonbridge (near to Tunbridge Wells), George Wise (1703–1779) is known to have had a business in 1746. It continued with his son Thomas, and Thomas&#x27;s nephew George (1779–1869), who took over in 1806. In its early years the company made articles such as workboxes and tea caddies with prints of popular views; later items had pictures created from mosaics. Their workshop in Tonbridge, &quot;Wise&#x27;s Tunbridge Ware Manufactory&quot;, was next to the Big Bridge over the Medway; the building was demolished in 1886 to widen the approach to the bridge.

Tunbridge ware became popular with visitors to the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, who bought them as souvenirs and gifts. Articles included cribbage boards, paperweights, writing slopes, snuff boxes and glove boxes.

At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Tunbridge ware by Edmund Nye, Robert Russell and Henry Hollamby was shown; Edmund Nye received a commendation from the judges for his work. He exhibited a table depicting a mosaic of a ship at sea; 110,800 tesserae were used in making the picture. 

The manufacturers of Tunbridge ware were cottage industries, and they were no more than nine in Tunbridge Wells and one in Tonbridge. The number declined in the 1880s; competent craftsmen were hard to find, and public tastes changed. After the death of Thomas Barton in 1903 the only surviving firm was Boyce, Brown and Kemp, which closed in 1927.

==Techniques==
&quot;Marquetry&quot; was an old technique which was continued by Nye and Barton to create images such as birds or butterflies.

&quot;Stickware&quot; and &quot;half-square mosaic&quot; was invented by James Burrows in about 1830: a bunch of wooden sticks of different colours, each having triangular or diamond-shaped cross section, were tightly glued together; in the case of stickware, the resulting block was dried, then turned to form an article such as the base of a pincushion. For half-square mosaic, thin slices were taken from the composite block, and applied to a surface.

&quot;Tesselated mosaic&quot;, was a development by James Burrows of half-square mosaic; it was adopted by George Wise and Edmund Nye. Minute tesserae were used to form a wide variety of geometric and pictorial designs.

Many sorts of wood were used for the various colours; about 40 were in regular use. Only natural colours were used; green was provided by &quot;green oak&quot;, produced by the action of fungus on fallen oak. Designs for articles were often taken from designs of Berlin wool work.

<doc id="1057068" wikidata="Q1537073" url="?curid=1057068" title="Johan Steyn, Baron Steyn">
<text>Johan van Zyl Steyn, Baron Steyn, PC (15 August 1932 – 28 November 2017) was a South African-British judge, until September 2005 a Law Lord. He sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

==Early life and education==

Steyn was born in Stellenbosch in the Union of South Africa, the son of Janet Lacey Blignaut and Izak van Zyl Steyn, a professor of law at the University of Stellenbosch. His father died before he was three years old and he subsequently were sent to live with his paternal grandparents. He received his schooling at the Hoërskool Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town where he matriculated in 1950. He studied law at the University of Stellenbosch before reading Law as a Rhodes Scholar at University College, Oxford.

== Career ==
He was called to the Bar in South Africa in 1958 and appointed a Senior Counsel of the Supreme Court of South Africa in 1970.
As a result of his opposition to apartheid in his native South Africa, he settled in the UK in 1973, joining the English Bar and building a distinguished international commercial law practice.

He was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1979 and was appointed a High Court Judge in 1985, receiving the customary knighthood, a surprise appointment by the then Conservative Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham. He served as presiding judge of the Northern Circuit from 1989 to 1991 and was appointed Lord Justice of Appeal in 1992.

On 11 January 1995 he was elevated to a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was created a life peer as Baron Steyn, of Swafield in the County of Norfolk. As a Law Lord he achieved prominence for his liberal views and espousal of human rights. He was a fierce critic of Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s claim to stand immune from prosecution. His record of open criticism of Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay led to pressure from the UK government that he make himself unavailable for the hearing on the indefinite detention of suspects under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 that began on 4 October 2004. The decision in the latter case caused the government to review its policy of indefinite detention of terror suspects and led to the equally controversial Terrorism Act 2006. His judicial work in the House of Lords has been instrumental in weaving the Human Rights Act 1998 into the fabric of English law. He also drew upon his background as a commercial lawyer.

His Hart Lecture of May 2000 was influential in its criticism of &quot;Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart&quot;, a landmark decision of the House of Lords on the use of legislative history in statutory interpretation.

He was one of the few senior judges to support calls for modernisation of the English legal system and abolition of the role of Lord Chancellor. While a Lord of Appeal he refrained from speaking in the House, instead expressing his views on democracy and human rights through judgments and lectures.

He retired as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary on 30 September 2005. Jonathan Mance was elevated from Lord Justice of Appeal on 1 October 2005 to replace him. After his retirement he was for a period the chairman of the human rights organisation JUSTICE and was vocal in his criticism of Tony Blair&#x27;s government and its approach to human rights. He had expressed grave misgivings over the proposed powers to allow detention without trial and about the use of existing anti-terror powers.

== Personal life ==
Steyn married Jean Pollard (1933–2023) in 1958. The couple had four children, Martin, Deon, Linda and Karen Steyn. Their daughter Dame Karen Steyn was appointed a High Court judge in 2019.

After his first marriage ended in divorce in 1976, Steyn married Susan Heard (née Lewis) in 1977.

Steyn had eight grandchildren (from his first marriage) and three stepgrandchildren (from his second marriage).

He died in 2017. On 10 October 2021 as part of the traditional &#x27;Wigs and Mitres Service&#x27; lecture at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Chapel his ashes were interred there.

==Notable judgments==

* &quot;In re L&quot; [1999] 1 AC 458, also called the &quot;Bournewood&quot; judgment – held that a compliant but incapacitated adult informally admitted to a psychiatric hospital was not detained unlawfully (later contradicted by the European Court of Human Rights)
* &quot;R (Jackson) v Attorney General&quot; [2006] 1 AC 262 – controversial comments on parliamentary supremacy and its common law foundations (and the possibility for the courts to invalidate unconstitutional statutes)
* &quot;MacLean v Arklow Investments Ltd&quot; [2000] 1 WLR 594 (Privy Council) – fiduciary duty arising from the purchase of Matakana Island
* &quot;Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd&quot; [1992] 4 All ER 363
* &quot;R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Pierson&quot; [1998] AC 539 – the Home Secretary cannot impose a harsher punishment than what was originally imposed, had it been done on the correct basis

<text>Charles Lahr (27 July 1885 – 15 August 1971), born Carl Lahr, was a German-born Jewish anarchist, London bookseller and publisher.

Lahr was born at Bad Nauheim in the Rhineland, the eldest of 15 children &quot;of peasant stock&quot;. He left Germany in 1905 to avoid military service and went to London, England, where he lived until his death in 1971.

In London he encountered the anarchist Guy Aldred (1886–1963) while working as a baker. He was soon (1907) under police observation. He joined the Industrial Workers of the World in 1914; at that time he had a bookshop in Hammersmith.

In 1915, he was interned for four years as an enemy alien in Alexandra Palace. Between 1920-22 he was briefly a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, however, he was excluded from membership in October 1922 on the grounds of &#x27;political unreliability&#x27;. His interest in politics led him to befriend many left-wing thinkers, several of whom went on to establish important left-wing groups in Great Britain. In 1921, he took over the &quot;Progressive Bookshop&quot; in Red Lion Street, Holborn. From there he would branch out into publishing, and establish many literary friendships (including H. E. Bates, Rhys Davies, T. F. Powys) and D. H. Lawrence. At one point, when Lahr was in financial difficulties, his writer friends gathered a collection of stories together and published these as &quot;Charles Wain&quot; (1933).

He was married in 1922 to Esther Argeband, (at that time Archer), whom he had met at the Charlotte Street Socialist Club. She was a Jewish factory worker from East London. They were close friends of William Roberts, the artist, and his wife, and William&#x27;s portrait of Esther is in the Tate Gallery.

From 1925 to 1927 Lahr published &quot;The New Coterie&quot; literary and artistic magazine. In 1931, he founded a small press, the Blue Moon Press. Amongst the books published by Blue Moon was the first edition of a small book of poems by D. H. Lawrence called &quot;Pansies&quot;.
In subsequent misfortunes, Lahr was convicted in 1935 on a charge of receiving stolen books and was sentenced to 6 months in prison. He was interned again in the Second World War. Lahr believed the internment was based on his German background and anarchist beliefs.

In a short story from &quot;Something Short and Sweet&quot; (published 1937), H. E. Bates describes the court case, with Lahr called &quot;Oscar&quot; in the story. The bookshop was bombed in 1941. He moved its premises several times in London.

He died at home in Muswell Hill, London on 15 August 1971. His funeral was attended by many representatives from left wing groups in the UK. His granddaughter is Professor Esther Leslie.

Lahr&#x27;s papers are held by the University of London.

<text>Ferdinando &quot;Fred&quot; Buscaglione (; 23 November 1921 – 3 February 1960) was an Italian singer and actor who became very popular in the late 1950s. His public persona – the character he played both in his songs and his movies – was of a humorous mobster with a penchant for whisky and women.

==Biography==
Ferdinando Buscaglione was born in Turin, Italy on 23 November 1921. The father was a painter and the mother a porter and piano teacher, both coming from Graglia, his great passion for music appeared at a very young age. When he was 11, his parents enrolled him at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Turin. During his teen years, he performed at nightclubs in Turin singing jazz and playing double bass and violin.

During World War II, he was incarcerated in an American internment camp in Sardinia. His musical talent was apparent and he was allowed to join the orchestra of the allied radio station of Cagliari. This permitted Buscaglione to continue to make music and to experiment with new sounds and rhythms coming from the U.S. (Most foreign music had been officially forbidden by the Italian Fascist regime.)

After the war, Buscaglione returned to Turin and went to live in &quot;Via Eusebio Bava&quot; 26 bis and resumed working as a musician for various bands. He then formed his own group, the Asternovas. During a tour in Switzerland in 1949 he met and married the half-German half-Moroccan entertainer Fatima Robin. In the meantime he was gradually creating his public character, inspired by Clark Gable and Mickey Spillane&#x27;s gangsters. His friend Leo Chiosso was a lyricist who wrote many of his songs. Together they wrote the hits that brought nationwide fame to Buscaglione: &quot;Che bambola&quot; (Whatta babe!), &quot;Teresa non sparare&quot; (Theresa, don&#x27;t shoot!), &quot;Eri piccola così&quot; (You were small like that), &quot;Guarda che luna&quot; (Look, What A (beautiful) Moon), &quot;Love in Portofino&quot;, &quot;Porfirio Villarosa&quot; (a caricature of Porfirio Rubirosa), &quot;Whisky facile&quot; (Easy Whiskey).

After perfecting his routine in night clubs and theatres he started recording his songs in 1955; the first single (a shellac 78rpm record containing &#x27;Che bambola&#x27; and &#x27;Giacomino&#x27;) sold 1,000,000 copies with close to no promotion, propelling him to a degree of fame he never considered possible.

By the end of the 1950s, Buscaglione was one of Italy&#x27;s most wanted entertainers. He appeared in advertising campaigns, on television, and in movies.

At 38 years of age, he was killed in a car accident when his lilac Ford Thunderbird collided with a truck Lancia Esatau in the early hours before dawn in Rome. Immediately brought to the hospital in a bus flagged down by the truck driver, he arrived there too late. Only hours earlier he had dinner with some friends at a restaurant in Rome and met future Italian pop diva Mina Mazzini who made her Sanremo Music Festival debut earlier. The two discussed a future collaboration that sadly never materialized. Tens of thousands people attended his funeral in Turin on 6 February 1960. He is buried in the &quot;Cimitero Monumentale&quot;.

Alongside his legacy, in songs and movies, Buscaglione deserves mention for having encouraged musicians and singers from the newer generation (the one influenced by the earliest forms of rock and roll) to stand up against the conservative producers and discographers of the time, demanding recognition for their art and their style. In this role, he proved instrumental in the rise of the &quot;yellers&quot; scene which from the early 60s started to revolutionize the Italian popular music panorama.

<text>Leo Matteo Chiosso (; 8 August 1920 – 26 November 2006) was an Italian lyricist mostly known for his work with Fred Buscaglione. They formed a songwriting duo who produced about forty songs and created Buscaglione&#x27;s public persona, a humorous tough guy with a penchant for whisky and women.

==Career==
Chiosso and Buscaglione met in 1938 in the night-club scene of Turin, hometown to both of them. At that time, Chiosso was a university student, while Buscaglione made a living as a jazz singer and musician in the clubs.

During World War II, Chiosso was deported to Poland, while Buscaglione ended up in a US internment camp in Sardinia. Chiosso received news of his friend&#x27;s fate thanks to the radio; Buscaglione had joined the allied radio station orchestra in Cagliari, and Chiosso knew he was still alive when he heard him playing.

Chiosso and Buscaglione reunited in Turin after the end of the war, and started writing songs together. Chiosso&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by the American crime fiction of which he was an avid reader, as well as by current news. They were humorous stories about gangsters and their babes, New York City and Chicago, tough men who were ruthless with enemies but easily fell victims to a woman&#x27;s charms. The duo&#x27;s songs matched Buscaglione&#x27;s carefully constructed image of an amiable braggart.

The first Buscaglione-Chiosso hit was &quot;Che bambola&quot; of 1956, which brought Buscaglione to nationwide celebrity. It was followed by many other hits, including &quot;Che notte&quot;, &quot;Criminalmente bella&quot;, &quot;Il dritto di Chicago&quot;, &quot;Eri piccola così&quot;, &#x27;&quot;Lontano da te&quot;, &quot;Love in Portofino&quot;, &quot;Porfirio Villarosa&quot;, &quot;Sgancia e pedala&quot;, &quot;Teresa non sparare&quot;, and &quot;Whisky facile&quot;.

Their last work together was the movie &quot;Noi duri&quot; of 1960, featuring Buscaglione and the Italian actor Totò. Chiosso wrote both the story and the script for the movie, as well as the lyrics for two songs of the soundtrack, &quot;Noi duri&quot; and &quot;Ninna nanna del duro&quot;. The making of the movie was still in progress when Buscaglione died in a car crash.

Chiosso&#x27;s career continued, writing lyrics for famous songs such as &quot;Parole, parole&quot;, &quot;Torpedo blu&quot;, and &quot;Montecarlo&quot;. He was also a prolific television author, with his credits including the popular music show &quot;Canzonissima&quot;. He also wrote stories and scripts for cinema.

<text>Maud Elisabeth Olofsson (born &quot;Olsson&quot;, 9 August 1955) is a former Swedish politician who was the leader of the Swedish Centre Party from 2001 to 2011, Minister for Enterprise and Energy from 2006 to 2011 and Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden from 2006 to 2010. She was a member of the Riksdag from 2002 to 2011.

==Biography==
Maud Olofsson was born in Arnäsvall, and grew up in Högbyn, in Örnsköldsvik Municipality, Västernorrland. She started her political career as an ombudsman of the youth organisation of the Centre Party in 1974, and served as a member of the local council in Luleå from 1976. From 1978 to 1981 she held the same job with the party. From 1992 to 1994, during the Carl Bildt centre-right government, she worked as Special Adviser to Minister Börje Hörnlund at the Department of Labour. From 1996 she has been a member of the Centre Party board. From 1997 to 2001 she worked as Managing Director for the Rural Economy and Agricultural Societies (&quot;Hushållningssällskapet&quot;) in Västerbotten. She was elected Party Leader on 19 March 2001, succeeding Lennart Daléus. After the 2002 election, the Centre Party&#x27;s first electoral upturn since 1973 was attributed to the &quot;Maud effect.&quot;

Olofsson&#x27;s political standpoint could be seen as a traditional Centre Party position, with an emphasis on rural Sweden and the survival of rural communities, combined with centre-right economic policies. It was however a remarkable new feature in the history of the Centre Party, when Olofsson characterized her party&#x27;s ideology as Social Liberalism. Although the Centre Party in history has sometimes cooperated with the governing Social Democrats, under Olofsson the party opted for a clear oppositional role, strengthening its alliance with the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Moderate Party.

Olofsson modernised the party, making it more open to the European Union and market liberalism. She was involved in the construction of the right-wing coalition Alliansen.

Following its victory in the elections in 2006, this alliance was able to form a new government under Fredrik Reinfeldt. Olofsson was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Enterprise and Energy.

Olofsson announced her intent to step down as party leader on 17 June 2011 and was succeeded by Annie Lööf on 23 September 2011. Following her retirement, she faced criticism after it was revealed that the Swedish state-owned energy company Vattenfall had paid too much for Dutch energy company Nuon in 2009 when she was the responsible minister.

<text>Microbial ecology (or environmental microbiology) is the ecology of microorganisms: their relationship with one another and with their environment. It concerns the three major domains of life—Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria—as well as viruses. This relationship is often mediated by secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms. These secondary metabolites are known as specialized metabolites and are mostly volatile or non volatile compounds. These metabolites include terpenoids, sulfur compounds, indole compound and many more.

The study of microorganisms and their interactions with the environment was pioneered by some scientists such as Sergei Winogradsky, Louis Pasteur, Martinus Beijerinck, Robert Koch, Lorenz Hiltner and many more.

Microorganisms are ubiquitous, and play various roles that impact the entire biosphere and any environment they found themselves both positively and negatively. Microbial life plays a primary role in regulating biogeochemical systems in virtually all environments, including some of the most extreme, from frozen environments and acidic lakes, to hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the deepest oceans, and some of the most familiar, such as the human small intestine, nose, and mouth. Microorganisms (soil microbes) are involved in biogeochemical cycles in the soil which helps in fixing nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur in the soil (environment). As a consequence of the quantitative magnitude of microbial life (calculated as cells,) microbes, by virtue of their biomass alone, constitute a significant carbon sink. Microbial interactions with their environment have industrial application such as wastewater treatment and bioremediation

Microorganisms also form several symbiotic relationships with other organisms in their environment where one or both of the partners involved benefit or one partner benefits while the other partner is harmed. Some symbiotic relationships include mutualism and commensalism.

Certain substances in the environment can kill microorganisms, thus preventing them from interacting with their environment. These substances are called antimicrobial substances. These can be antibiotic, antifungal, or even antiviral.

== History ==

While microbes have been studied since the seventeenth century, this research was primarily on physiological perspective rather than an ecological one. For instance, Louis Pasteur and his disciples were interested in the problem of microbial distribution both on land and in the ocean. Louis Pasteur was the scientist who invented the pasteurization process. Martinus Beijerinck invented the enrichment culture, a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial biogeographic idea that &quot;everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects&quot;, which was stated by Lourens Baas Becking. Sergei Winogradsky was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand microorganisms outside of the medical context—making him among the first students of microbial ecology and environmental microbiology—discovering chemosynthesis, and developing the Winogradsky column in the process.

Beijerinck and Windogradsky, however, were focused on the physiology of microorganisms, not the microbial habitat or their ecological interactions. Modern microbial ecology was launched by Robert Hungate and coworkers, who investigated the rumen ecosystem. The study of the rumen required Hungate to develop techniques for culturing anaerobic microbes, and he also pioneered a quantitative approach to the study of microbes and their ecological activities that differentiated the relative contributions of species and catabolic pathways.

Progress in microbial ecology has been tied to the development of new technologies. The measurement of biogeochemical process rates in nature was driven by the availability of radioisotopes beginning in the 1950s. For example, 14CO2 allowed analysis of rates of photosynthesis in the ocean (ref). Another significant breakthrough came in the 1980s, when microelectrodes sensitive to chemical species like O2 were developed. These electrodes have a spatial resolution of 50–100 μm, and have allowed analysis of spatial and temporal biogeochemical dynamics in microbial mats and sediments.

Although measuring biogeochemical process rates could analyse what processes were occurring, they were incomplete because they provided no information on which specific microbes were responsible. It was long known that &#x27;classical&#x27; cultivation techniques recovered fewer than 1% of the microbes from a natural habitat. However, beginning in the 1990s, a set of cultivation-independent techniques have evolved to determine the relative abundance of microbes in a habitat. Carl Woese first demonstrated that the sequence of the 16S ribosomal RNA molecule could be used to analyse phylogenetic relationships. Norm Pace took this seminal idea and applied it to analysfe &#x27;who&#x27;s there&#x27; in natural environments. The procedure involves (a) isolation of nucleic acids directly from a natural environment, (b) PCR amplification of small subunit rRNA gene sequences, (c) sequencing the amplicons, and (d) comparison of those sequences to a database of sequences from pure cultures and environmental DNA. This has provided tremendous insights into the diversity present within microbial habitats. However, it does not resolve how to link specific microbes to their biogeochemical role. Metagenomics, the sequencing of total DNA recovered from an environment, can provide insights into biogeochemical potential, whereas metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics can measure actual expression of genetic potential but remains more technically difficult.

==Roles==
Microorganisms are the backbone of all ecosystems, but even more so in areas where photosynthesis cannot take places due to lack of light. In such zones, chemosynthetic microbes provide energy, and carbon to the other organisms. Chemosynthetic microorganisms gain energy by oxidizing inorganic compounds such as hydrogen, nitrite, ammonia, elemental sulfur and iron(II). These organisms can be found in both aerobic and anaerobic environment. Chemosynthetic microorganisms are primary producer in extreme environment such as high temperature geothermal environments. These chemotrophic organisms can also function in anoxic environments by using other electron acceptors for their respiration.

Other microbes are decomposers, with the ability to recycle nutrients from other organisms&#x27; waste products. These microbes play a critical role in biogeochemical cycles. The nitrogen cycle, the phosphorus cycle, the sulphur cycle, and the carbon cycle all depend on microorganisms in one way or another. Each cycle works together to regulate the microorganisms in certain processes. For example, the nitrogen gas which makes up 78% of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is unavailable to most organisms, until it is converted to a biologically available form by the microbial process of nitrogen fixation. Through these biogeochemical cycles, microorganisms are able to make nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium available in the soil. Differing from the nitrogen and carbon cycles, stable gaseous species are not created in the phosphorus cycle in the environment. Microorganisms play a role in solubilizing phosphate, improving soil health, and plant growth.

Again, microbial interaction are involved in bioremediation. Bioremediation is a technology that is employed to remove heavy metal contaminants from soil and wastewater using microorganisms. Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi removes organic and inorganic pollutants by oxidizing or reducing them. Example of microorganisms that play role in bioremediation of heavy metals include &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;Arthrobacter&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, &quot;Methosinus&quot;, &quot;Rhodococcus&quot;, &quot;Stereum hirsutum&quot;, &quot;Methanogens&quot;, &quot;Aspergilus niger&quot;, Pleurotus ostreatus, &quot;Rhizopus arrhizus&quot;, &quot;Azotobacter&quot;, &quot;Alcaligenes&quot;, &quot;Phormidium valderium&quot;, and &quot;Ganoderma applantus&quot;.

== Symbiosis ==
Symbiosis is a close, long term relationship between organisms of different species. Symbiosis can be ectosymbiosis (one organism lives on the surface of other organism) or endosymbiosis (one organism lives inside other organism). Symbiotic relationship can also exist between microorganism that live closely together in a given environment. Symbiotic relationship is found at every level within the ecosystem and has contributed in shaping life. Microorganism produce, change, and utilize nutrient and natural products in numerous ways and this enable them to be ubiquitous. Microbes, especially bacteria, often engage in symbiotic relationships (either positive or negative) with other microorganisms or larger organisms. Plants and animals happen to be the habitat of microorganism that are involved in mutualistic relationship. While such relationships are vital for the development of the microbes, these microbes can provide protection to their host against unfavorable changes in the environment or against predators. They do this by producing bioactive compounds. Although physically small, symbiotic relationships amongst microbes are significant in eukaryotic processes and their evolution. The types of symbiotic relationship that microbes participate in include mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, and amensalism which affect the ecosystem in many ways.

=== Mutualism ===
Mutualism is a close relationship between two different species in which each has a positive effect on the other . In mutualism, one partner provides service to the other partner and also receives service from the other partner as well. Mutualism in microbial ecology is a relationship between microbial species and other species (example humans) that allows for both sides to benefit. Microorganisms form mutualistic relationship with other microorganism, plants or animals. One example of microbe-microbe interaction would be syntrophy, also known as cross-feeding, of which &quot;Methanobacterium omelianskii&quot; is a classical example. This consortium is formed by an ethanol fermenting organism and a methanogen. The ethanol-fermenting organism provides the archaeal partner with the H2, which this methanogen needs in order to grow and produce methane. Syntrophy has been hypothesized to play a significant role in energy and nutrient-limited environments, such as deep subsurface, where it can help the microbial community with diverse functional properties to survive, grow and produce maximum amount of energy. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is carried out by mutualistic consortium of a sulfate-reducing bacterium and an anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaeon. The reaction used by the bacterial partner for the production of H2 is endergonic (and so thermodynamically unfavored) however, when coupled to the reaction used by archaeal partner, the overall reaction becomes exergonic. Thus the two organisms are in a mutualistic relationship which allows them to grow and thrive in an environment, deadly for either species alone. Lichen is an example of a symbiotic organism.

Microorganisms also engage in mutualistic relationship with plants and a typical example of such relationship is arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) relationship, a symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi. This relationship begins when chemical signals are exchange between the plant and the fungi leading to the metabolic stimulation of the fungus. The fungus then attacks the epidermis of the plant’s root and penetrates its highly branched hyphae into the cortical cells of the plant. In this relationship, the fungi gives the plant phosphate and nitrogen obtained from the soil with the plant in return providing the fungi with carbohydrate and lipids obtained from photosynthesis. Also, microorganisms are involve in mutualistic relationship with mammals such as humans. As the host provides shelter and nutrient to the microorganisms, the microorganisms also provide benefits such as helping in the growth of the gastrointestinal tract of the host and protecting host from other detrimental microorganisms.

=== Commensalism ===
Commensalism is very common in microbial world, literally meaning &quot;eating from the same table&quot;. It is a relationship between two species where one species benefits with no harm or benefit for the other species. Metabolic products of one microbial population are used by another microbial population without either gain or harm for the first population. There are many &quot;pairs &quot;of microbial species that perform either oxidation or reduction reaction to the same chemical equation. For example, methanogens produce methane by reducing CO2 to CH4, while methanotrophs oxidise methane back to CO2.

=== Amensalism ===
Amensalism (also commonly known as antagonism) is a type of symbiotic relationship where one species/organism is harmed while the other remains unaffected. One example of such a relationship that takes place in microbial ecology is between the microbial species &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas taetrolens&quot;. When co-existing in an environment, &quot;Pseudomonas taetrolens&quot; shows inhibited growth and decreased production of lactobionic acid (its main product) most likely due to the byproducts created by &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot; during its production of lactic acid. However, &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot; shows no difference in its behaviour.

== Microbial resource management ==
Biotechnology may be used alongside microbial ecology to address a number of environmental and economic challenges. For example, molecular techniques such as community fingerprinting or metagenomics can be used to track changes in microbial communities over time or assess their biodiversity. Managing the carbon cycle to sequester carbon dioxide and prevent excess methanogenesis is important in mitigating global warming, and the prospects of bioenergy are being expanded by the development of microbial fuel cells. Microbial resource management advocates a more progressive attitude towards disease, whereby biological control agents are favoured over attempts at eradication. Fluxes in microbial communities has to be better characterized for this field&#x27;s potential to be realised. In addition, there are also clinical implications, as marine microbial symbioses are a valuable source of existing and novel antimicrobial agents, and thus offer another line of inquiry in the evolutionary arms race of antibiotic resistance, a pressing concern for researchers.

== In built environment and human interaction ==
Microbes exist in all areas, including homes, offices, commercial centers, and hospitals. In 2016, the journal &quot;Microbiome&quot; published a collection of various works studying the microbial ecology of the built environment.

A 2006 study of pathogenic bacteria in hospitals found that their ability to survive varied by the type, with some surviving for only a few days while others survived for months.

The lifespan of microbes in the home varies similarly. Generally bacteria and viruses require a wet environment with a humidity of over 10 percent. &quot;E. coli&quot; can survive for a few hours to a day. Bacteria which form spores can survive longer, with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; surviving potentially for weeks or, in the case of &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, years.

In the home, pets can be carriers of bacteria; for example, reptiles are commonly carriers of salmonella.

&quot;S. aureus&quot; is particularly common, and asymptomatically colonizes about 30% of the human population; attempts to decolonize carriers have met with limited success and generally involve mupirocin nasally and chlorhexidine washing, potentially along with vancomycin and cotrimoxazole to address intestinal and urinary tract infections.

=== Antimicrobials ===
Antimicrobials are substances that are capable of killing microorganism. Antimicrobial can be antibacterial or antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral substance and most of these substance are natural products or may have been obtain from natural products. Natural products are therefore vital in the discovery of pharmaceutical agents. Most of the naturally obtained antibiotics are produced by organism under the phylum Actinobacteria. The genus Streptomyces are responsible for most of the antibiotic substances produced by Actinobacteria. These natural products with antimicrobial properties belong to the terpenoids, spirotetronate, tetracenedione, lactam, and other groups of compounds. Examples include napyradiomycin, nomimicin, formicamycin, and isoikarugamycin, Some metals, particularly copper, silver, and gold also have antimicrobial properties. Using antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces is a technique that has begun to be used in the 21st century to prevent the transmission of bacteria. Silver nanoparticles have also begun to be incorporated into building surfaces and fabrics, although concerns have been raised about the potential side-effects of the tiny particles on human health. Due to the antimicrobial properties certain metals possess, products such as medical devices are made using those metals.

=== Evolution ===
Due to the high level of horizontal gene transfer among microbial communities, microbial ecology is also of importance to studies of evolution. Microbial ecology contributes to the evolution in many different parts of the world. For example, different microbial species evolved CRISPR dynamics and functions, allowing a better understanding of human health.

<doc id="1057085" wikidata="Q2496499" url="?curid=1057085" title="Lévy C curve">
<text>In mathematics, the Lévy C curve is a self-similar fractal curve that was first described and whose differentiability properties were analysed by Ernesto Cesàro in 1906 and Georg Faber in 1910, but now bears the name of French mathematician Paul Lévy, who was the first to describe its self-similarity properties as well as to provide a geometrical construction showing it as a representative curve in the same class as the Koch curve. It is a special case of a period-doubling curve, a de Rham curve.

==L-system construction==
If using a Lindenmayer system then the construction of the C curve starts with a straight line. An isosceles triangle with angles of 45°, 90° and 45° is built using this line as its hypotenuse. The original line is then replaced by the other two sides of this triangle.

At the second stage, the two new lines each form the base for another right-angled isosceles triangle, and are replaced by the other two sides of their respective triangle. So, after two stages, the curve takes the appearance of three sides of a rectangle with the same length as the original line, but only half as wide.

At each subsequent stage, each straight line segment in the curve is replaced by the other two sides of a right-angled isosceles triangle built on it. After &quot;n&quot; stages the curve consists of 2&quot;n&quot; line segments, each of which is smaller than the original line by a factor of 2&quot;n&quot;/2.

This L-system can be described as follows:

where &quot;&quot; means &quot;draw forward&quot;, &quot;+&quot; means &quot;turn clockwise 45°&quot;, and &quot;−&quot; means &quot;turn anticlockwise 45°&quot;.

The fractal curve that is the limit of this &quot;infinite&quot; process is the Lévy C curve. It takes its name from its resemblance to a highly ornamented version of the letter &quot;C&quot;. The curve resembles the finer details of the Pythagoras tree.

The Hausdorff dimension of the C curve equals 2 (it contains open sets), whereas the boundary has dimension about 1.9340 .

===Variations===
The standard C curve is built using 45° isosceles triangles. Variations of the C curve can be constructed by using isosceles triangles with angles other than 45°. As long as the angle is less than 60°, the new lines introduced at each stage are each shorter than the lines that they replace, so the construction process tends towards a limit curve. Angles less than 45° produce a fractal that is less tightly &quot;curled&quot;.

==IFS construction==

If using an iterated function system (IFS, or the chaos game IFS-method actually), then the construction of the C curve is a bit easier. It will need a set of two &quot;rules&quot; which are: Two points in a plane (the translators), each associated with a scale factor of 1/. The first rule is a rotation of 45° and the second −45°. This set will iterate a point [&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] from randomly choosing any of the two rules and use the parameters associated with the rule to scale/rotate and translate the point using a 2D-transform function.

Put into formulae:

:formula_1
:formula_2

from the initial set of points formula_3.

<doc id="1057088" wikidata="Q3828521" url="?curid=1057088" title="The Adventures of Shirley Holmes">
<text>The Adventures of Shirley Holmes is a children&#x27;s mystery television series that aired on YTV from May 7, 1997, to May 7, 2000. The show was created by Ellis Iddon and Phil Meagher (of Winklemania Productions, UK) who had produced a successful series of books with HarperCollins, teaming up with Credo, Forefront, Winchester and Winklemania to develop the TV series. Filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

The show has been broadcast in over 80 countries and has been dubbed in French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Norwegian, Russian, Serbian, Polish and Turkish.

Her performance in the show led to actress Meredith Henderson being nominated for a Gemini Award in 1998 and winning one in 1999. The show itself was twice nominated for a Gemini Award in the category &quot;Best Children&#x27;s or Youth Program or Series&quot; in 1998 and eventually won it in 1999. In the spring of 1998 Susin Nielsen won a Gemini Award in the category &quot;Best Writing in a Children&#x27;s or Youth Program&quot; for her screenplay of the episode &quot;The Case of the Burning Building&quot;. In the same year, Elizabeth Stewart won a WGC Award from the Writers Guild of Canada for her writing of the episode &quot;The Case of the Maestro&#x27;s Ghost&quot;.

Original music was composed by Terry Frewer, although the theme tune was written and performed by show creators Ellis Iddon and Phil Meagher.

Credo spokesperson and producer Kim Todd named a growth spurt in the cast as one of the key reasons for cancelling the show. The aging of the actors would have meant a distinct change in tone and content had the show continued.

==Plot overview==
The series follows the life of Shirley Holmes, the great-grandniece of Sherlock Holmes who, with the help of ex-gang member Bo Sawchuk, tackles a variety of mysteries in and around the fictional city of Redington, Manitoba. On some occasions, she finds herself matching wits with nemesis Molly Hardy.

==Cast and characters==

===Main characters===
*Meredith Henderson as Shirley Holmes: The great-great-niece of Sherlock Holmes, Shirley is the daughter of British diplomat Robert Holmes and virologist Dr. Joanna Holmes. She carries on her famous ancestor&#x27;s legacy of solving crimes through deductive reasoning while attending the prestigious Sussex Academy. In addition to Sherlock&#x27;s detective skills such as deductive reasoning and disguise, she also has his mannerisms, but she can still express her emotions. She prefers to keep a low profile so she can continue her sleuthing. She wears a variety of hats throughout the series. Henderson, as Shirley, was the only character to appear in all episodes of the show.
*John White as Francis Boris &quot;Bo&quot; Sawchuk: Shirley&#x27;s sidekick. An ex-gang member from a Ukrainian family, Bo attends Sussex Academy on a scholarship. He first met Shirley in afterschool detention and was amazed at the girl detective&#x27;s deductions about him. Shirley came to his aid after he was falsely accused of setting a work shed on campus on fire. After that case was solved, Bo became her sleuthing partner and best friend, akin to the relationship between &#x27;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; and &#x27;Dr. Watson&#x27;. He was supposed to be colorblind in first episode however that was never mentioned again. Bo is commonly mistaken as Shirley&#x27;s boyfriend. His first appearance was in &quot;The Case of the Burning Building.&quot; At the end of the series, he leaves for Ukraine to further his studies. White, as Bo, appears in all episodes of the series except &quot;The Case of the Forbidden Mountain,&quot; where he is only mentioned by name.
*Sarah Ezer as Molly Hardy: Shirley&#x27;s nemesis, and Moriarty counterpart; her name is a reference to Sherlock Holmes&#x27; infamous foe. A newcomer to Sussex Academy, Molly first appeared as Alicia Gianelli&#x27;s running mate during the school election for student council president. Through an elaborate scheme, Molly is elected student council president. Her true scheming nature is hidden from everyone except Shirley and Bo. Although her machinations are routinely thwarted by Shirley, Molly manages to escape punishment. She is revealed to be a sociopath in &quot;The Case of the Crooked Comic&quot; and is a mastermind of evil genius with an IQ of 160. Molly first appeared in &quot;The Case of the Ruby Ring.&quot; It is possible that she is in fact descended from Professor Moriarty.
*Annick Obonsawin as Alicia Gianelli: Alicia first appeared in &quot;The Case of the Ruby Ring&quot;. Alicia is a good friend of Shirley and Bo, and she works at the Quazar Cafe, often mixing up orders of her customers. However, she also bows out easily to peer pressure and appears more simple-minded and materialistic than Shirley is.
*Brendan Fletcher as Sterling &quot;Stink&quot; Patterson: Class clown and prankster. His parents run the local novelty store. If Molly is Shirley&#x27;s &#x27;Moriarty&#x27;, Stink could be considered her &#x27;Sebastian Moran&#x27;, though while being a trouble-maker he is far less malicious. Stink first appeared in &quot;The Case of the Ruby Ring&quot; and his last appearance was in &quot;The Case Of The Crooked Comic&quot;. His departure from the series was explained as Molly being unable to get Stink back into Sussex Academy.
*Blair Slater as Bartholemew &quot;Bart&quot; James: Bart first appeared in &quot;The Case of the Ruby Ring.&quot; He is highly interested in the paranormal and considers it good fortune to be abducted by aliens. He is also very concerned about his studies, as seen when Math is taken out of the curriculum in Sussex during &quot;The Case of the Calculated Crime&quot;. He may be a little odd, but Bo and Shirley still treat him as a friend, and he is aware of Shirley&#x27;s sleuthing activities and sometimes helps out.
*Chris Humphreys as Robert Holmes: Shirley&#x27;s father, the great-nephew of Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Holmes first appeared in &quot;The Case of the Burning Building.&quot; He is mostly worried for his daughter because he knows her tendency to get involved in cases out of curiosity, and at first he had almost given up hope on finding his wife. His last appearance in the series is in &quot;The Case of the Vanishing Virus.&quot;
*Elizabeth Shepherd as Peggy &quot;Gran&quot; Holmes: Shirley&#x27;s grandmother and Mr. Holmes&#x27; mother. Peggy does not appear in the series after &quot;The Case of the Forbidden Mountain&quot; and is mentioned to have gone on vacation in the Fiji Islands in &quot;The Case of the Vanishing Virus.&quot;
*Marie Stillin as Ms. Cynthia Stratmann: Headmistress of Shirley&#x27;s school, Sussex Academy, an upright woman who always works hard to succeed. She first appeared in the first episode, &quot;The Case Of The Burning Building,&quot; where she caught Shirley arriving late to class, therefore giving her detention where she ended up meeting Bo. She has a close friendship with Mr. Howie and is a Molly Hardy supporter, unaware of Molly&#x27;s true intentions. 
*Colin Fox as Mr. Arthur Howie: Shirley&#x27;s history teacher at Sussex. He used to attend Sussex and boarded at the dorm, and was also a very popular student, as shown in &quot;The Case of the Dead Debutante&quot;. However, he has kinder-phobia, the phobia of children, as revealed in &quot;The Case of the Alien Abductions&quot;.
*Maggie Huculak as Dr. Joanna Holmes: Shirley&#x27;s mother, who had disappeared for several years as a result of being in Rwanda during a civil war. She, Shirley, and Robert are reunited when Mr. Holmes is offered the chance to go to Rwanda on business. It is often said that Shirley shares her curiosity and determination to never give up.

<text>St Enoch station was a mainline railway station in the city of Glasgow, Scotland between 1876 and 1966. The hotel was the first building in Glasgow to be fitted out with electric lighting. The station was demolished in 1977.

== History ==
Located on St Enoch Square in the city centre, it was opened by the City of Glasgow Union Railway in 1876. The first passenger train stopped there on 1 May 1876 and the official opening took place on 17 October 1876.

In 1883 it was taken over by the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&amp;SWR) and it became their headquarters. Services ran to most parts of the G&amp;SWR system, including , , , and . In partnership with the Midland Railway, through services also ran to England, using the Settle and Carlisle Railway from Carlisle to , , and ; the so-called Thames-Clyde route.

It was the site of a rail crash in 1903 in which 16 passengers were killed and 64 injured when a train overran the buffers. In the 1923 grouping it was taken over and then operated by the London Midland and Scottish Railway. After the nationalisation of the United Kingdom rail network, the station was run by British Railways.

The suburban service to East Kilbride was diverted to St Enoch in 1959, when all but three services were dieselised. The diversion was said to be necessary to reduce the numbers of trains at Glasgow Central.

It was a large station with 12 platforms and two impressive semi-cylindrical glass/iron roofed train sheds. The station was closed on 27 June 1966 as part of the rationalisation of the railway system undertaken by the British Railways Board chairman Dr. Richard Beeching; upon closure its 250 trains and 23,000 passengers a day were diverted to Central. The roofs of the structure were demolished, despite protests, in 1977. The clock that was suspended from the roof of the station was saved from destruction and is now on display in Cumbernauld Town Centre.

The St Enoch Hotel which fronted the station was also demolished in 1977.

== Current site ==
The site of the station is now occupied by another glass structure, the St Enoch Centre, a large shopping centre. The remains of the station and hotel were used to help fill in the Queen&#x27;s Dock, today the home of the SEC Centre, the SEC Armadillo and the OVO Hydro.

Though the mainline station is gone, parts of the arcaded approach embankments (now containing shops and restaurants) can be seen to the east of the shopping centre&#x27;s car park on Osborne Street. Although the short remaining section which once led into the station now goes nowhere, the southern section remains as a freight line along the route of the Glasgow City Union Railway, crossing the Clydebridge Viaduct of 1899 which spans the River Clyde.

The red sandstone ticket hall which stands in St Enoch Square immediately west of the shopping centre is not part of the former rail station, but is the former ticket hall for the adjacent St Enoch subway station on the Glasgow Subway.

== Dunlop Street railway station ==
St Enoch station replaced a previous station close by called Glasgow Dunlop Street, which was opened by the City of Glasgow Union Railway on 12 December 1870 and closed by the Glasgow and South Western Railway the same day St Enoch opened.

<text>Farzad Bazoft (; 22 May 1958 – 15 March 1990) was an Iranian journalist who settled in the United Kingdom in the mid-1970s. He worked as a freelance reporter for &quot;The Observer&quot;. He was arrested by Iraqi authorities and executed in 1990 after being convicted of spying for Israel while working in Iraq.

==Biography==
Bazoft went to live in the United Kingdom in 1975 at the age of 16. He was sentenced to 18 months jail after robbing the Heart of England Building Society in Brackley in 1981. The sentence included a deportation order, which Bazoft appealed against successfully in 1983.

After finishing his education he began a career as a freelance journalist, contributing articles about the Middle East and, in particular, the Iran–Iraq War to news outlets including &quot;The Observer&quot; and the BBC. In 1989 he was invited by the Iraqi government to come to Iraq along with other journalists to report on elections being held in Kurdistan. Before Bazoft set off, he learned about a mysterious explosion that had occurred on 19 September 1989 at the al-Iskandaria military complex, south of Baghdad. The heavy detonation was heard as far away as Baghdad. Despite Saddam Hussein&#x27;s personal order to keep the matter secret, rumours began to spread that the accident happened in a rocket factory&#x27;s assembly line, killing dozens of Egyptian technicians involved in Iraq&#x27;s secret development of medium-range ballistic missiles.

Sensing a possible scoop, Bazoft headed for al-Hilla to search for details. He allegedly undertook his investigation with the approval of Iraqi officials. &quot;Observer&quot; editor Donald Trelford said in response to Bazoft&#x27;s arrest: &quot;Farzad Bazoft is not a spy. He is a reporter who went to do a story. He said in advance the story he was going to do. He told the Baghdad government where he wanted to go. ... This is not the action of a spy, this is the action of a reporter.&quot; Other Western reporters were also interested in the story, but a camera crew from Independent Television News was stopped by Iraqi authorities before they could reach the plant. Bazoft got through, driven by British nurse Daphne Parish. Bazoft also asked military personnel in Baghdad hotels and casinos what they knew and was reported by hotel security to the Iraqi Intelligence Service.

Bazoft was arrested at Baghdad International Airport in September 1989, while waiting for his flight back to London. He had 34 photographs of the area of al-Hilla in his luggage, and some soil from near the factory. After six weeks in custody at the Abu Ghraib prison, and, after beatings, Bazoft was put in front of TV cameras on 1 November and made to confess to being an Israeli agent. Parish had also been arrested by Iraqi authorities. Before their trial, President Saddam Hussein wrote to British prime minister Margaret Thatcher assuring her that Bazoft and Parish would get a fair trial.

Following a one-day trial behind closed doors, lacking conclusive evidence of his guilt, Bazoft was convicted and sentenced to death on 10 March 1990. Parish was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but she was released on 16 July 1990 following a plea for clemency from Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda.

International appeals for clemency for Bazoft had no effect. He was not permitted to appeal against his conviction or sentence, and was executed by hanging at 6:30am on 15 March 1990.

==Aftermath==

Bazoft&#x27;s body was placed in a rough wooden crate and despatched to his family in the United Kingdom. Documents seized during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 confirm that Saddam Hussein personally stressed the need for Bazoft&#x27;s execution to take place before Ramadan (which began that year on 16 March), to quash attempts for clemency by the British government.

Immediately after the execution, Britain recalled its ambassador to Iraq and cancelled all ministerial visits, though the Conservative Party was not unanimous on the response, with Conservative MPs Rupert Allason and Anthony Beaumont-Dark supporting the Iraqi government response, and Phil Dicks even publicly stating on the day before the execution that Bazoft &quot;deserved to be hanged&quot;. Bazoft&#x27;s story nonetheless triggered widespread outrage in the West and contributed to international isolation of Saddam&#x27;s regime. Months after the incident, on 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, sparking the first Gulf War. During that war, the command tank of the UK&#x27;s 7th Armoured Brigade was named &quot;Bazoft&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; tracked down Kadem Askar, the colonel in the Iraqi intelligence service who conducted the initial interrogation of Bazoft. He admitted that he knew Bazoft was innocent, but that he was powerless to obstruct Saddam Hussein&#x27;s orders to have him convicted and executed. That Hussein himself ordered the execution of Bazoft is confirmed in transcripts of taped meetings made by the Hussein regime and seized during the 2003 invasion.

The release of papers from 1990 at the beginning of 2017 revealed that the Thatcher government decided to take no action against Iraq out of an anxiety that doing so might risk British exports. Norman Lamont, chief secretary to the treasury in 1990, told &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;There was some argument about how British he was – he did have an Iranian passport and that was the decisive thing: he wasn&#x27;t a British citizen&quot;. Bazoft qualified for British residency.

<text>The District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands (in case citations, D. N. Mar. I.) is a federal territorial court whose jurisdiction comprises the United States-affiliated Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). It was established by Act of Congress in 1977, pursuant to an international agreement between the United States and the CNMI that brought the CNMI under United States sovereignty. The court began hearing cases in January 1978. The court regularly sits in Saipan but may sit elsewhere in the CNMI. The court has the same jurisdiction as United States district courts, including diversity jurisdiction and bankruptcy jurisdiction. However, the District Court is not an Article III U.S. District Court, and because of that its judge is appointed for a 10-year term instead of for life. Appeals are taken to the Ninth Circuit.

Like most federal judges, judges in this court are appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation. Judges may serve more than one term, subject to the standard nominating process.

The United States is represented in civil and criminal litigation in the court by the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The first District Judge appointed was Alfred Laureta, who served from 1978 until 1988. His successor, Alex R. Munson, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, and confirmed by the Senate in 1988. Munson was nominated for a second ten-year term by President Bill Clinton and was confirmed by the Senate in 1998. He took senior status effective February 28, 2010. On January 26, 2011, President Obama nominated Ramona Villagomez Manglona to be Judge for the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for a term of ten years. The U.S. Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on July 26, 2011, and she received her commission on July 29, 2011. Her initial ten-year term ended on July 28, 2021, although she was allowed to continue serving until the confirmation of a successor. She was later nominated by President Joe Biden for a second ten-year term and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 16, 2024.

The District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands was established by Pub. L. 95–157, 91 Stat. 1265 (Nov. 8, 1977), and is codified at , a nonpositive law title.

<doc id="1057123" wikidata="Q1134177" url="?curid=1057123" title="Peaceful coexistence">
<text>Peaceful coexistence () was a theory, developed and applied by the Soviet Union at various points during the Cold War in the context of primarily Marxist–Leninist foreign policy and adopted by Soviet-dependent socialist states, according to which the Socialist Bloc could peacefully coexist with the capitalist bloc (i.e., U.S.-allied states). This was in contrast to the antagonistic contradiction principle that socialism and capitalism could never coexist in peace. The Soviet Union applied it to relations between the western world, particularly NATO countries, and nations of the Warsaw Pact.

Debates over differing interpretations of peaceful coexistence were one aspect of the Sino-Soviet split in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s, the People&#x27;s Republic of China under the leadership of its founder, Mao Zedong, argued that a belligerent attitude should be maintained towards capitalist countries, and so initially rejected the peaceful coexistence theory as essentially Marxist revisionism. Their decision in 1972 to establish a trade relationship with the United States also saw China cautiously adopting a version of the theory to relations between itself and non-socialist countries. From that point through the early 1980s and the adoption of Socialism with Chinese characteristics, China increasingly extended its own peaceful coexistence concept to include all nations. Albanian ruler Enver Hoxha (at one time, China&#x27;s only true ally) also denounced this and turned against China as a result of the latter&#x27;s growing ties to the West, as exemplified by Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China in 1972; today, Hoxhaist parties continue to denounce the concept of peaceful coexistence.

Peaceful coexistence, in extending itself to all countries and social movements tied to the USSR&#x27;s interpretation of communism, quickly became modus operandi for many individual communist parties as well, encouraging quite a few, especially those in the developed world, to give up their long-term goal of amassing support for an armed, insurrectionist communist revolution in exchange for more active participation in electoral politics.

==Soviet policy==
Khrushchev solidified the concept in Soviet foreign policy in 1956 at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The policy arose as an attempt to reduce hostility between the two superpowers, particularly in light of the possibility of nuclear war. The Soviet theory of peaceful coexistence asserted that the United States and USSR, and their respective political ideologies, could coexist rather than fighting one another, and Khrushchev tried to demonstrate his commitment to peaceful coexistence by attending international peace conferences, such as the Geneva Summit, and by traveling internationally, such as his 13-day trip to tour the United States in 1959. The World Peace Council founded in 1949 and largely funded by the Soviet Union attempted to organize a peace movement in favor of the concept internationally.

Peaceful coexistence was meant to assuage Western, capitalist concerns that the socialist Soviet Union was driven by the concept of world revolution advocated by its founders, Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Lenin and the Bolsheviks advocated world revolution through workers&#x27; &quot;internal revolutions&quot; within their own nations, but they had never advocated its spread by international warfare, such as invasion by Red Army troops from a neighboring socialist nation into a capitalist one.

Indeed, short of such &quot;internal revolutions&quot; by workers themselves, Lenin had talked about &quot;peaceful cohabitation&quot; with capitalist countries. Khrushchev used this aspect of Lenin&#x27;s politics to argue that while socialism would eventually triumph over capitalism, this would be done not by force but by example. Implicitly, this proclamation meant the end of the USSR&#x27;s advocacy of the spread of communist revolution through insurrectionist violence, which some communists around the world saw as a betrayal of the principles of revolutionary communism itself.

In addition to being a reaction to the realization that a nuclear war between the two superpowers would ensure the destruction of not only the socialist system but the entirety of humanity, it also reflected the USSR&#x27;s strategic military disposition - the move away from large, and possibly politically offensive, military ventures towards a force centered on proxy wars and a strategic nuclear missile force. Although disquiet over this shift helped bring Khrushchev down, his successors did not return to the antagonistic contradiction theories of an inevitable conflict between the capitalist and socialist systems. Initially, this was China&#x27;s main gripe with the theory, and the reason the latter from then on classified the Soviet Union as a &quot;betrayer of the Revolution.&quot;

===Cuban policy===
One of the most outspoken critics of peaceful coexistence during the early 1960s was Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. As a leader in the Cuban government during the October Missile Crisis, Guevara believed that a repeat invasion by the United States (after the Bay of Pigs) would be justifiable grounds for a nuclear war. In Guevara&#x27;s view, the capitalist bloc was composed of &quot;hyenas and jackals&quot; that &quot;fed on unarmed peoples&quot;.

==Chinese policy==
Premier Zhou Enlai of the People&#x27;s Republic of China proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in 1954 during negotiations with India over Tibet and these were written into the &quot;Agreement Between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse Between the Tibet Region of China and India&quot; signed in 1954 by Zhou and Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru. The principles were reiterated by Zhou at the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries where they were incorporated into the conference declarations. One major consequence of this policy was that the PRC would not support Communist insurgencies in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Malaysia, and would distance itself from overseas Chinese in those nations.

Mao Zedong pursued close relations with &#x27;capitalist&#x27; countries like Pakistan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Iran and Zambia. China did not endorse or support the Communist rebellion in the Philippines and hosted Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos in 1975. In 1972, the U.S. president Richard Nixon visited China. China extended credit to Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s Chile. The pro-Western dictator of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko visited Beijing in 1973, and signed economic and technical cooperation agreements.

To justify China&#x27;s close relations with U.S. allies, the Three Worlds Theory was adopted. Both U.S. and U.S.S.R were seen as imperialist powers.

With Mao&#x27;s death the Chinese softened their line, though would never endorse the views of their rivals. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the concept of peaceful coexistence was expanded as a framework for all sovereign nations. In 1982 the Five Principles were written into the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China which claims to be bound by them in its international relations.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as promoted by China are:
*mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity
*mutual non-aggression
*non-interference in each other&#x27;s internal affairs
*equality and mutual benefit
*peaceful co-existence

There are three notable consequences of the Chinese concept of peaceful coexistence. First of all, in contrast with the Soviet concepts of the mid-1970s, the Chinese concepts include the encouragement of global free trade. Second, the Chinese concept of peaceful coexistence places a large emphasis on national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and thus moves by the United States to promote its interests are seen in this framework as hostile. Finally, as the PRC does not consider Taiwan to be sovereign, the concept of peaceful coexistence does not extend to Taiwan, and efforts by other nations, particularly the United States, to involve itself in PRC-Taiwan relations are seen as hostile actions in this framework.

==Use in modern diplomacy==
More recently, the phrase has gained currency beyond its usage in communist phraseology and has been adopted by the broader diplomatic world. For instance, in his 2004 Christmas address, Pope John Paul II called for &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; in the Middle East.

<doc id="1057126" wikidata="Q4767626" url="?curid=1057126" title="Anna Wood (born 1980)">
<text>Anna Victoria Wood (27 May 1980 – 24 October 1995) was an Australian teenager who died after consuming an ecstasy tablet at a rave party in inner Sydney. Her cause of death was hypoxic encephalopathy, following acute water intoxication secondary to ingestion of MDMA.

Wood&#x27;s death was covered widely in the news media, produced debate on drug use among adolescents and inspired the memoir &quot;Anna&#x27;s Story&quot; (1996) by Bronwyn Donaghy.

== Events leading up to death ==
Wood had recently left The Forest High School after completing Year 10 to pursue a career in beauty therapy at a salon near her home in Sydney&#x27;s North Shore. On 21 October 1995, Wood and a group of school friends attended an &quot;Apache&quot; rave dance party at the Phoenician Club on Broadway in Ultimo, in inner-city Sydney. She had told her parents that she was going to a friend&#x27;s house to have a sleepover. Wood and her friends bought and consumed ecstasy tablets from a female friend outside the club prior to entering. At approximately 5:00a.m. on 22 October, Wood began feeling unwell inside the club and was seen rushing to the toilets, where she was found vomiting. Her friends drove her back to one of their homes in Belrose where she was put to bed. Wood&#x27;s symptoms showed no signs of improving: there were continued episodes of dry retching, intermittent sleep, confusion and possible convulsion-like movements, followed by a lapse into unconsciousness. At 10:00a.m. Wood&#x27;s parents were informed, who called for an ambulance and had her taken to the Royal North Shore Hospital in St Leonards. Wood remained in a coma throughout the period and did not regain consciousness; she died on Tuesday, 24 October 1995 after her life support was turned off following the declaration that she was brain dead.

== Coroner&#x27;s report ==
The subsequent coroner&#x27;s report determined that the cause of death was a cerebral edema caused by water intoxication (hyponatraemia) secondary to use of MDMA. Hyponatraemia occurs when excessive fluid consumption dilutes sodium levels in the blood supply, leading to water absorption in the body&#x27;s cells. Absorption of too much water causes cell swelling, which in the brain can cause irreparable damage as the human skull leaves little room for expansion inside. The brain&#x27;s functions are also disrupted by cell swelling, resulting in respiratory arrest among other symptoms. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH) that occurs in some users of MDMA can compound hyponatraemia by disrupting the body&#x27;s normal response of releasing excess water by excretion.

The coroner recommended improved drug education information stressing the need for immediate medical attention if a user of MDMA became ill under its influence. J. A. Henry, a British physician from the Medical Toxicology Unit at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, noted that British recommendations for appropriate water consumption for MDMA users stressed the different needs of users who were dancing strenuously and those who were not.

== Aftermath and media coverage ==
Wood&#x27;s death was widely reported in the media and represented a change in how ecstasy-related stories were covered. Whereas previous ecstasy-related incidents had received minimal coverage and were reported in the context of crime, delinquency and secrecy, Wood&#x27;s &quot;girl next door&quot; image, and death, was extensively covered and turned into a warning against illicit drug-use in society. It was initially put forward in the media that the ecstasy tablet taken by Wood was probably laced with heroin or morphine, the purported cause of her death, but the coroner&#x27;s report determined that only MDMA was present in Wood&#x27;s body.

Wood&#x27;s funeral took place on 1 November 1995 at the Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens.

The initial coverage of the event was soon followed by media stories ranging from concerns about drug use in Australian teenagers to attacks on techno music and raves for their corrupting influence on youth. The Phoenician Club in particular was singled out, with calls to have the venue closed down, a move endorsed by the then-NSW Premier, Bob Carr. In the event, the club was allowed to continue to run but it had to abandon hosting dance parties. The death of Anna Wood also fuelled perceptions that drug-taking was a serious problem among Australian teenagers, even though a NSW AMA report from the time established that only 3% of 14- to 19-year-olds had used ecstasy. Rave culture in Australia and Wood&#x27;s death was documented on the popular Australian television news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 1996, creating further debate.

The intensity of the media coverage can be explained to a degree by Wood&#x27;s appearance as an average, middle-class &quot;good girl&quot; whose life had been tragically taken from her. She did not fit the stereotype of the street-living junkie and so was turned into an object of sympathy instead. She was the child that &quot;everyone could relate to&quot;, and, as a result, was used as a warning to prevent incidents. Wood&#x27;s death was sympathetically covered by Bronwyn Donaghy in a book on the event entitled &quot;Anna&#x27;s Story&quot; in 1996. It raised similar concerns in the media that drug-taking was a problem among youth and argued against drug decriminalisation as a response to Wood&#x27;s death.

While her death renewed calls for a more hardline approach to be taken on drugs in the media and by politicians, Jack Marx of &quot;The Age&quot; pointed out that this &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach may have scared Wood&#x27;s friends into not taking her immediately to a hospital where her life could have been saved.

Wood&#x27;s death nevertheless raised awareness about ecstasy use in the general community, which until that time had been less well known in Australia. Her death was seen as unusual because in 1995 the number of people who had died from ecstasy use was very low. The raised awareness of ecstasy use led to the Australian state governments instituting new laws in the running of dance venues. In NSW, the Code of Practice for Dance Parties was passed in 1997, which made the provision of chill rooms and free water compulsory for clubs to obtain their licence. This was seen as an acknowledgement of the reality of ecstasy use in the dance scene and the need for pragmatic legislation by governments to prevent further deaths. The coroner&#x27;s report into Wood&#x27;s death had also recommended public advice on ecstasy use and water intake to avoid further water intoxication fatalities.

The notoriety of Wood&#x27;s death saw it continue to surface in the public after the turn of the century. It was referred to during the 2007 NSW state election, for instance, when NSW Opposition Leader Peter Debnam used it and some other youth deaths to claim the state government was not doing enough to prevent further tragedies. Her death often resurfaces in the Australian media when other Australian teenagers die after taking ecstasy. In November 2015 (after the death of a Sydney woman at the Stereosonic music festival), Wood&#x27;s father stated that &quot;[he] hoped Anna&#x27;s death would make a difference, but we are not making progress against drugs. I think the pro-legalisation lobby has a lot to answer for. They keep on about harm reduction. They say just take the stuff safely. But there is no safe way. You just don’t know what will happen when you take drugs.&quot;

==History==
===War in Yugoslavia===
The main initiator and leader of the persecution of the non-Serb population in the valley of the Vrbanja river and Bosanska Krajina, including Čelinac, was a member of the SDS — Radoslav Brđanin, a native of the nearby village of Popovac.

Brđanin was a leading political figure in the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK). During The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s, he was in key positions at the municipal, regional and &quot;republic&quot; level.

<doc id="1057132" wikidata="Q328035" url="?curid=1057132" title="William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher">
<text>William Baliol Brett, 1st Viscount Esher, PC (13 August 181524 May 1899), known as Sir William Brett between 1868 and 1883, was a British lawyer, judge, and Conservative politician. He was briefly Solicitor-General under Benjamin Disraeli and then served as a justice of the Court of Common Pleas between 1868 and 1876, as a Lord Justice of Appeal between 1876 and 1883 and as Master of the Rolls. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Esher in 1885 and further honoured when he was made Viscount Esher on his retirement in 1897.

== Background and education ==
Brett was a son of the Reverend Joseph George Brett, of Chelsea, London, by Dorothy, daughter of George Best, of Chilston Park, Boughton Malherbe, Kent. He was educated at Westminster School, King&#x27;s College London and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Brett rowed for Cambridge University Boat Club against Leander Club in 1837 and 1838, then in the victorious Cambridge crew against Oxford University in the 1839 Boat Race.

== Career ==
Called to the Bar in 1840, Brett went to the northern circuit and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1861. On the death of Richard Cobden in 1865, he unsuccessfully contested Rochdale as a Conservative, but in an 1866 by-election, he was returned for Helston in unique circumstances. He and his opponent polled exactly the same number of votes, and the mayor, as returning officer, then gave his casting vote for the Liberal candidate. As the vote was given after four o&#x27;clock, however, an appeal was lodged, and the House of Commons allowed both members to take their seats.

Brett rapidly made his mark in the House, and in early 1868, he was knighted and appointed Solicitor General under Benjamin Disraeli. On behalf of the Crown, he prosecuted the Fenians charged with having caused the Clerkenwell Outrage. In Parliament, he took a leading part in the promotion of bills connected with the administration of law and justice. In August 1868, he was appointed a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Some of his sentences in this capacity excited much criticism, notably so in the case of the gas stokers strike, when he sentenced the defendants to imprisonment for twelve months, with hard labour, which was afterwards reduced by the Home Secretary to four months.

On the reconstitution of the Court of Appeal in 1876, Brett was elevated to the rank of a Lord Justice of Appeal. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. After holding the position for seven years, he succeeded Sir George Jessel as Master of the Rolls in 1883. In 1885 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Esher, &quot;of Esher in the County of Surrey&quot;. He opposed the bill proposing that an accused person or his wife might give evidence in their own case and supported the bill that empowered Lords of Appeal to sit and vote after their retirement. The Solicitors Act 1888, which increased the powers of the Incorporated Law Society, owed much to his influence. In 1880, he delivered a speech in the House of Lords, deprecating the delay and expense of trials, which he regarded as having been increased by the Judicature Act 1873. He retired from the bench at the close of 1897, and was created Viscount Esher, &quot;of Esher in the County of Surrey&quot;, a dignity rarely given to any judge, Lord Chancellors excepted.

==Judgments==
*&quot;Tamplin v James&quot; (1880) 15 Ch D 215 (CA), upholding a decision of Baggallay LJ in the first instance; contract law concerning the availability of specific performance for a breach of contract induced by mistake.
*&quot;Compagnie Financiere du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co&quot; (1882) 11 QBD 55 - Established the modern test for discovery of documents. 
*&quot;Heaven v Pender&quot; (1883) - In the obiter dicta in his judgment of the Court of Appeal, Brett MR sought to establish a general &quot;duty of care&quot; between parties that would have led to a tort of negligence. Such a principle was only finally accepted by English courts in 1932.
*&quot;Foakes v Beer&quot; (Brett sitting in the Court of Appeal) [1884] UKHL 1, [1881-85] All ER Rep 106, (1884) 9 App Cas 605; 54 LJQB 130; 51 LT 833; 33 WR 233 - a leading case from the House of Lords on the legal concept of consideration
*&quot;In the Arbitration between Secretary of State for Home Department and Fletcher&quot; (1887) - upholding a Queens bench decision supporting the authority of the Inspector of Mines to require the use of safety lamps; Bowen LJ dissenting.
*&quot;Filburn v People&#x27;s Palace and Aquarium Co Ltd&quot; (1890) was a case that imposed strict liability upon owners of wild animals for harm caused by them.
*&quot;British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique&quot; [1893] AC 602 (Esher sitting in the Court of Appeal) - Esher dissented from the Court of Appeal decision of Fry LJ and Lopes LJ; the House of Lords overturned their decision and by so doing established the &quot;Mozambique rule&quot;, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign land, the right to possession of foreign land, and trespass to foreign land non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions.
*&quot;The Satanita&quot; [1897] AC 59 - Contract law case atypical of the conventional offer &amp; acceptance pattern seen in English law. Brett&#x27;s decision at appeal affirmed by the House of Lords.
* &quot;Chatenay v Brazilian Submarine Telegraph Company Ltd&quot; [1891] QB 79 - choice of law in relation to transactions under foreign powers of attorney

==Family==

Lord Esher married Eugénie Mayer (1814–1904) in 1850. She was the daughter of Finette and Lazare Mayer, and the step-daughter of Lt Col John Gurwood, the editor of Wellington&#x27;s Dispatches. They had two sons, Reginald, and Eugène, and a daughter Violet, wife of William Humble Dudley Ward and mother of William Dudley Ward. Lord Esher died in London in May 1899, aged eighty-three, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Reginald.

<text>The Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company (NITHCo) is a government-owned body which was established in 1967 to take over the railway and bus services of the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA), namely Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) and Ulsterbus. The company was established by the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967.

In 1973, Citybus took over the bus services of the Belfast Corporation Transport Department.

Between 1971 and 1994, NITHCo ran Belfast International Airport through its subsidiary Northern Ireland Airports Limited (NIAL). In 1994, the government created Belfast International Airport Ltd (BIAL), which was sold to Belfast International Airport Holdings Ltd, a management/employee buy-out vehicle.

<text>Myrmecia is a genus of ants first established by Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1804. The genus is a member of the subfamily Myrmeciinae of the family Formicidae. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is a large genus of ants, comprising at least 93 species that are found throughout Australia and its coastal islands, while a single species is only known from New Caledonia. One species has been introduced out of its natural distribution and was found in New Zealand in 1940, but the ant was last seen in 1981. These ants are commonly known as bull ants, bulldog ants or jack jumper ants, and are also associated with many other common names. They are characterized by their extreme aggressiveness, ferocity, and painful stings. Some species are known for the jumping behavior they exhibit when agitated.

Species of this genus are also characterized by their elongated mandibles and large compound eyes that provide excellent vision. They vary in colour and size, ranging from . While workers and queens are hard to distinguish from each other due to their similar appearance, males are identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. Almost all &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species are monomorphic, with little variation among workers of a given species. Some queens are ergatoid and have no wings, while others have either stubby or completely developed wings. Nests are mostly found in soil, but they can be found in rotten wood and under rocks. One species does not nest in the ground at all; its colonies can only be found in trees.

A queen will mate with one or more males, and during colony foundation she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. The life cycle of the ant from egg to adult takes several months. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; workers exhibit greater longevity in comparison to other ants, and workers are also able to reproduce with male ants. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is one of the most primitive group of ants on earth, exhibiting differentiated behaviors from other ants. Workers are solitary hunters and do not lead other workers to food. Adults are omnivores that feed on sweet substances, but the larvae are carnivores that feed on captured prey. Very few predators eat these ants due to their sting, but their larvae are often consumed by blindsnakes and echidnas, and a number of parasites infect both adults and brood. Some species are also effective pollinators.

&quot;Myrmecia&quot; stings are very potent, and the venom from these ants is among the most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human population are allergic to the venom of &quot;M. pilosula&quot; and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung. People prone to severe allergic reactions can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).

==Etymology and common names==
The generic name &quot;Myrmecia&quot; derives from Greek word &quot;Myrmec-&quot; (+ -&quot;ia&quot;), meaning &quot;ant&quot;. In Western Australia, the Indigenous Australians called these ants &quot;kallili&quot; or &quot;killal.&quot;

Ants of this genus are popularly known as bulldog ants, bull ants, or jack jumper ants due to their ferocity and the way they hang off their victims using their mandibles, and also due to the jumping behaviour displayed by some species. Other common names include &quot;inch ants&quot;, &quot;sergeant ants&quot;, and &quot;soldier ants&quot;. The jack jumper ant and other members of the &quot;Myrmecia pilosula&quot; species group are commonly known as &quot;black jumpers&quot;, &quot;hopper ants&quot;, &quot;jumper ants&quot;, &quot;jumping ants&quot;, &quot;jumping jacks&quot;, and &quot;skipper ants&quot;.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Genetic evidence suggests that &quot;Myrmecia&quot; diverged from related groups about 100 million years ago (Mya). The subfamily Myrmeciinae, to which &quot;Myrmecia&quot; belongs, is believed to have been found in the fossil record of 110 Mya ago. However, one study suggests that the age of the most recent common ancestor for &quot;Myrmecia&quot; and &quot;Nothomyrmecia&quot; is 74 Mya, and the subfamily is possibly younger than previously thought. Ants of the extinct genus &quot;Archimyrmex&quot; may possibly be the ancestor of &quot;Myrmecia&quot;. In the Evans&#x27; vespoid scala, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; and other primitive ant genera such as &quot;Amblyopone&quot; and &quot;Nothomyrmecia&quot; exhibit behavior which is similar to a clade of soil-dwelling families of vespoid wasps. Four species groups form a paraphyletic assemblage while five species groups form a monophyletic assemblage. The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships within &quot;Myrmecia&quot;:

===Classification===

&quot;Myrmecia&quot; was first established by Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in his 1804 publication &quot;Systema Piezatorum&quot;, in which seven species from the genus &quot;Formica&quot; were placed into the genus along with the description of four new species.
&quot;Myrmecia&quot; has been classified into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858, British entomologist Frederick Smith placed it in the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae. It was placed in the subfamily Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established the Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified them as a subfamily in 1858. He again treated them as a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated the Poneridae as a subfamily and classified &quot;Myrmecia&quot; as one of its constituent genera but later placed it in the Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in the Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; was placed into the Myrmeciinae; this was the last time the genus was placed into a different ant subfamily.
In 1911, Emery classified the subgenera &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, &quot;Pristomyrmecia&quot;, and &quot;Promyrmecia&quot;, based on the shape of their mandibles. Wheeler established the subgenus &quot;Halmamyrmecia&quot;, and the ants placed in it were characterized by their jumping behavior. The taxon Wheeler described was not referred to in his later publications, and the genera &quot;Halmamyrmecia&quot; and &quot;Pristomyrmecia&quot; were synonymised by John Clark. At the same time, Clark reclassified the subgenus &quot;Promyrmecia&quot; as a full genus. He revised the whole subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1951, recognizing 118 species and subspecies in &quot;Myrmecia&quot; and &quot;Promyrmecia&quot;; five species groups were assigned to &quot;Myrmecia&quot; and eight species groups to &quot;Promyrmecia&quot;. This revision was rejected by entomologist William Brown due to the lack of morphological evidence that would make the two genera distinct from each other. Due to this, Brown classified &quot;Promyrmecia&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Myrmecia&quot; in 1953. Clark&#x27;s revision was the last major taxonomic study on the genus before 1991, and only a single species was described in the intervening years. In 2015, four new &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants were described by Robert Taylor, all exclusive to Australia. Currently, 94 species are described in the genus, but as many as 130 species may exist.

Under the present classification, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is the only extant genus in the tribe Myrmeciini, subfamily Myrmeciinae. It is a member of the family Formicidae in the order Hymenoptera. The type species for the genus is &quot;M. gulosa&quot;, discovered by Joseph Banks in 1770 during his expedition with James Cook on HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;. &quot;M. gulosa&quot; is among the earliest Australian insects to be described, and the specimen Banks collected is housed in the Joseph Banks Collection in the Natural History Museum, London. &quot;M. gulosa&quot; was described by Fabricius in 1775 under the name &quot;Formica gulosa&quot; and later designated as the type species of &quot;Myrmecia&quot; in 1840.

===Genetics===
The number of chromosomes per individual varies from one to over 70 among the species in the genus. The genome of &quot;M. pilosula&quot; is contained on a single pair of chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number possible for any animal, and workers of this species are homologous. Like &quot;M. pilosula&quot;, &quot;M. croslandi&quot; also contains a single chromosome. While these ants only have a single chromosome, &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; contains 41 chromosomes, while &quot;M. brevinoda&quot; contains 42. The chromosome count for &quot;M. piliventris&quot; and &quot;M. fulvipes&quot; is two and 12, respectively. The genus &quot;Myrmecia&quot; retains many traits that are considered basal for all ants (i.e. workers foraging alone and relying on visual cues).

===Species groups===
&quot;Myrmecia&quot; contains a total of nine species groups. Originally, seven species groups were established in 1911, but this was raised to 13 in 1951; &quot;Promyrmecia&quot; had a total of eight, while &quot;Myrmecia&quot; only had five. &quot;M. maxima&quot; does not appear to be in a species group, as no type specimen is available.

==Description==

&quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants are easily noticeable due to their large mandibles, large compound eyes that provide excellent vision and a powerful sting that they use to kill prey. Each of their eyes contains 3,000 facets, making them the second largest in the ant world. Size varies widely, ranging from in length. The largest &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species is &quot;M. brevinoda&quot;, with workers measuring ; &quot;M. brevinoda&quot; workers are also the largest in the world. Almost all species are monomorphic, but &quot;M. brevinoda&quot; is the only known species where polymorphism exists. It is well known that two worker subcastes exist, but this does not distinguish them as two different polymorphic forms. This may be due to the lack of food during winter and they could be incipient colonies. The division of labour is based on the size of ant, rather than its age, with the larger workers foraging for food or keeping guard outside the nest, while the smaller workers tend to the brood.

Their colouration is variable; black combined with red and yellow is a common pattern, and many species have golden-coloured pubescence (hair). Many other species are brightly coloured which warns predators to avoid them. The formicine ant &quot;Camponotus bendigensis&quot; is similar in appearance to &quot;M. fulvipes&quot;, and data suggest &quot;C. bengdigensis&quot; is a batesian mimic of &quot;M. fulvipes&quot;. The number of malpighian tubules differs between castes; in &quot;M. dispar&quot;, males have 16 tubules, queens range from 23 to 26, and workers have 21 to 29.

Worker ants are usually the same size as each other, although this is not true for some species; worker ants of &quot;M. brevinoda&quot;, for example, vary in length from . The mandibles of the workers are long with a number of teeth, and the clypeus is short. The antennae consist of 12 segments and the eyes are large and convex. Based on a study on the antennal sensory of &quot;M. pyriformis&quot;, the antennal sensilla are known to have eight types. Large ocelli are always present.

Queens are usually larger than the workers, but are similar in colour and body shape. The head, node, and postpetiole are broader in the queen, and the mandibles are shorter and also broad. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; queens are unique in that particular species either have fully winged queens, queens with poorly developed wings, or queens without any wings. For example, &quot;M. aberrans&quot; and &quot;M. esuriens&quot; queens are ergatoid, meaning that they are wingless. Completely excavated nests showed no evidence of any winged queen residing within them. Some species have queens which are subapterous, meaning they are either wingless or only have rudiments of wings; the queens can be well developed with or without these wing buds. &quot;M. nigrocincta&quot; and &quot;M. tarsata&quot; are &quot;brachypterous&quot;, where queens have small and rudimentary wings which render the queen flightless. Dealated queens with developed wings and thoraces are considered rare. In some species, such as &quot;M. brevinoda&quot; and &quot;M. pilosula&quot;, three forms of queens exist, with the dealated queens being the most recognisable.

Males are easy to identify due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants&#x27; bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male &quot;M. gulosa&quot; was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, and it had a long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.

Among the largest larvae examined were those of &quot;M. simillima&quot;, reaching lengths of . The pupae are enclosed in dark cocoons.

==Distribution and habitat==

Almost all species in the genus &quot;Myrmecia&quot; are found in Australia and its coastal islands. &quot;M. apicalis&quot; is the only species not native to Australia and is only found in the Isle of Pines, New Caledonia. Only one ant has ever established nests outside its native range; &quot;M. brevinoda&quot; was first discovered in New Zealand in 1940 and the ant was recorded in Devonport in Auckland in 1948, 1965 and 1981 where a single nest was destroyed. Sources suggest the ant was introduced to New Zealand through human activity; they were found inside a wooden crate brought from Australia. While no eradication attempt was made by the New Zealand government, the ant has not been found in the country since 1981 and is presumed to have been eradicated.

Ants of this genus prefer to inhabit grasslands, forests, heath, urban areas and woodland. Nests are found in &quot;Callitris&quot; forest, dry marri forest, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; woodland and forests, mallee scrub, in paddocks, riparian woodland, and wet and dry sclerophyll forests. They also live in dry sandplains, and coastal plain. When a queen establishes a new colony, the nest is at first quite simple structurally. The nest gradually expands as the colony grows larger. Nests can be found in debris, decaying tree stumps, rotten logs, rocks, sand, and soil, and under stones. While most species nest underground, &quot;M. mjobergi&quot; is an arboreal nesting species found on epiphytic ferns of the genus &quot;Platycerium&quot;. Two types of nests have been described for this genus: a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, and a complex structure surrounded by a mound. Some species construct dome-shaped mounds containing a single entrance, but some nests have numerous holes that are constantly used and can extend several metres underground. Sometimes, these mounds can be 0.5 m (20 in) high. Workers decorate these nests with a variety of items, including charcoal, leaves, plant fragments, pebbles, and twigs. Some ants use the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat quickly, providing the nest with solar energy traps.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Foraging===

The genus &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is among the most primitive of all known living ants, and ants of the genus are considered specialist predators. Unlike most ants, workers are solitary hunters, and do not lay pheromone trails; nor do they recruit others to food. Tandem running does not occur, and workers carrying other workers as a method of transportation is rare or awkwardly executed. Although &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is not known to lay pheromone trails to food, &quot;M. gulosa&quot; is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones while &quot;M. pilosula&quot; can attack &quot;en masse&quot;, suggesting these ants can also induce alarm pheromones. &quot;M. gulosa&quot; induces territorial alarm behaviour using pheromones from three sources; an alerting substance from the rectal sac, a pheromone found in the Dufour&#x27;s gland, and an attack pheromone from the mandibular gland. Despite &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants being among the most primitive ants, they exhibit some behaviours considered &quot;advanced&quot;; adults will sometimes groom each other and the brood, and distinct nest odors exist for each colony.

Most species are diurnal, and forage on the ground or onto low vegetation in search of food, but a few are nocturnal and only forage at night. Most &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants are active during the warmer months, and are dormant during winter. However, &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; is a nocturnal species that is active throughout the whole year. &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; also has a unique foraging schedule; 65% of individuals who went out to forage left the nest in 40–60 minutes, while 60% of workers would return to the nest in the same duration of time at dusk. Foraging workers rely on landmarks for navigation back home. If displaced a short distance, they will scan their surroundings, and then rapidly move in the direction of the nest. &quot;M. vindex&quot; ants carry dead nest-mates out of their nests and place them on refuse piles, a behaviour known as necrophoresis.

===Pollination===
While pollination by ants is somewhat rare, several &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species have been observed pollinating flowers. For example, the orchid &quot;Leporella fimbriata&quot; is a myrmecophyte which can only be pollinated by the winged male ant &quot;M. urens&quot;. Pollination of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males all die. The flower mimics &quot;M. urens&quot; queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. &quot;M. nigrocincta&quot; workers have been recorded visiting flowers of &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; and &quot;Senna acclinis&quot;, and are considered a potential pollination vector for &quot;E. regnans&quot; trees. Although &quot;Senna acclinis&quot; is self-compatible, the inability of &quot;M. nigrocincta&quot; to appropriately release pollen would restrict its capacity to effect pollination. Foraging &quot;M. pilosula&quot; workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of &quot;Prasophyllum alpinum&quot; (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants&#x27; jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether &quot;M. pilosula&quot; contributes to pollination is unknown.

===Diet===

Despite their ferocity, adults are nectarivores, consuming honeydew (a sweet, sticky liquid found on leaves, deposited from various insects), nectar, and other sweet substances. The larvae, however, are carnivorous. After they reach a certain size, they are fed insects that foragers capture and kill. The workers also regurgitate food for other ants to consume. Young ants are rarely fed food regurgitated by adults. Adult workers prey on a variety of insects and arthropods, such as beetles, caterpillars, earwigs, &quot;Ithone fusca&quot;, &quot;Perga&quot; sawflies, and spiders. Other prey include invertebrates such as bees, cockroaches, crickets, wasps and other ants; in particular, workers prey on &quot;Orthocrema&quot; ants (a subgenus of &quot;Crematogaster&quot;) and &quot;Camponotus&quot;, although this is risky since these ants are able to call for help through chemical signals. Slaters, earthworms, scale insects, frogs, lizards, grass seeds, possum feces and kangaroo feces are also collected as food. Flies such as the housefly and blowfly are consumed. Some species, such as &quot;M. pilosula&quot;, will only attack small fly species and ignore larger ones. Nests of the social spider &quot;Delena cancerides&quot; are often invaded by &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; ants, and nests once housing these spiders are filled with debris such as twigs and leaves by the workers, rendering them useless. These &quot;scorched earth&quot; tactics prevent the spiders competing with the ants. &quot;M. gulosa&quot; attacks Christmas beetles, but workers later bury them.

&quot;Myrmecia&quot; is one of the very few genera where the workers lay trophic eggs, or infertile eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are &quot;M. forceps&quot; and &quot;M. gulosa&quot;. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this is most likely to happen when no dead insects are available.

===Predators, parasites and associations===
&quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants deter many potential predators due to their sting. The blindsnake &quot;Ramphotyphlops nigrescens&quot; consumes the larvae and pupae of &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, while avoiding the potent sting of the adults, which it is vulnerable to. The short-beaked echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;) also eats the eggs and larvae. Nymphs of the assassin bug species &quot;Ptilocnemus lemur&quot; lure these ants to themselves by trying to make the ant sting them, by waving its hind legs around to attract a potential prey item. Body remains of &quot;Myrmecia&quot; have been found in the stomach contents of the eastern yellow robin &quot;(Eopsaltria australis)&quot;. The Australian magpie (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;), the black currawong (&quot;Strepera versicolor&quot;), and the white-winged chough (&quot;Corcorax melanorhamphos&quot;) prey on these ants, but few are successfully taken.

The host association between &quot;Myrmecia&quot; and eucharitid wasps began several million years ago; &quot;M. forficata&quot; larvae are the host to &quot;Austeucharis myrmeciae&quot;, being the first recorded eucharitid parasitoid of an ant, and &quot;Austeucharis fasciiventris&quot; is a parasitoid to &quot;M. gulosa&quot; pupae. &quot;M. pilosula&quot; is affected by a gregarines parasite that changes an ant&#x27;s colour from their typical black appearance to brown. This was discovered when brown workers were dissected and found to have &quot;gregarinasina&quot; spores, while black workers showed no spores. Another unidentified gregarine parasite is known to infect the larvae of &quot;M. pilosula&quot; and other &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species. This gregarine parasite also softens the ant&#x27;s cuticle. Other parasites include &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;, &quot;Paecilomyces lilacinus&quot;, &quot;Chalcura affinis&quot;, &quot;Tricoryna&quot; wasps, and various mermithid nematodes.

&quot;M. hirsuta&quot; and &quot;M. inquilina&quot; are the only known species in this genus that are inquilines and live in other &quot;Myrmecia&quot; colonies. An &quot;M. inquilina&quot; queen has been found in an &quot;M. vindex&quot; colony. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is a larval attendant to the butterfly &quot;Theclinesthes serpentata&quot; (saltbush blue), while some species, particularly &quot;M. nigrocincta&quot;, enslave other ant species, notably those in the genus &quot;Leptomyrmex&quot;. &quot;M. nigriceps&quot; ants are able to enter another colony of the same species without being attacked, as they may be unable to recognise alien conspecifics, nor do they try to distinguish nestmates from ants of another colony. &quot;Formicoxenus provancheri&quot; and &quot;M. brevinoda&quot; share a form of symbiotic relationship known as xenobiosis, where one species of ant will live with another and raise their young separately, with &quot;M. brevinoda&quot; being the host. &quot;Solenopsis&quot; may sometimes nest in &quot;Myrmecia&quot; colonies, as a single colony was found to have three or four &quot;Solenopsis&quot; nests inside. &quot;Lagria&quot; beetles and rove beetles in the genus &quot;Heterothops&quot; dwell inside colonies and skinks and frogs have also been found living unmolested within &quot;Myrmecia&quot; nests. &quot;Metacrinia nichollsi&quot;, for example, has been reported living inside &quot;M. regularis&quot; colonies.

===Life cycle===

Like other ants, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants begin as an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, it becomes a haploid male. They develop through complete metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through larval and pupal stages before emerging as adults.

During the process of founding a colony, as many as four queens cooperate with each other to find a suitable nesting ground, but after the first generation of workers is born, they fight each other until one queen is left alive. However, occasional colonies are known to have as many as six queens coexisting peacefully in the presence of workers. A queen searches for a suitable nest site to establish her colony, and excavates a small chamber in the soil or under logs and rocks, where she takes care of her young. A queen also hunts for prey instead of staying in her nest, a behaviour known as claustral colony founding. Although queens do provide sufficient amounts of food to feed their larvae, the first workers are &quot;nanitics&quot; (or minims), smaller than the smallest workers encountered in older developed colonies. Several species do not have any worker caste, and solitary queens will raid a colony, kill the residing queen, and take over the colony. The first generation of workers may take a while to fully develop into adults; for example, &quot;M. forficata&quot; eggs take around 100 days to fully develop, while other species may take up to eight months.

Queens lay around eight eggs, but less than half of these eggs develop. Some species, such as &quot;M. simillima&quot; and &quot;M. gulosa&quot;, lay their eggs singly on the colony floor, while &quot;M. pilosula&quot; ants may lay eggs in a clump. These clumps have two to 30 eggs each with no larvae present. Certain &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species do not lay their eggs singly and form clumps of eggs, instead. The larvae are capable of crawling short distances without the assistance of adult workers, and workers will cover the larvae in dirt to help them spin into a cocoon. If cocoons are isolated from a colony, they are capable of shedding their skins before hatching, allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation. Sometimes, a newborn can emerge from its pupa without the assistance of other ants. Once these ants are born, they are able to identify distinct tasks, a well known primitive trait. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; lifespans vary in each species, but their longevity is greater than many ant genera: &quot;M. nigrocincta&quot; and &quot;M. pilosula&quot; have a lifespan of one year, while &quot;M. nigriceps&quot; workers can live up to 2.2 years. The oldest recorded worker was a &quot;M. vindex&quot;, living up to 2.6 years. If a colony is deprived of workers, queens are able to revert to colony-founding behaviours until a sustainable workforce emerges. A colony may also emigrate to a new nesting spot altogether.

===Reproduction===

Winged, virgin queens and males, known as alates, appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. Twenty females or fewer are found in a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at different times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), but there is one case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30 km/h (18 mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30 °C (86 °F), and elevations of 91 metres (300 ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested &quot;M. pilosula&quot; colonies are polygynous while &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. &quot;M. pulchra&quot; queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.

Both independent and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded with &quot;M. pilosula&quot; queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically related to each other in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try to return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature colony. &quot;M. dispar&quot; colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, &quot;M. nigrocincta&quot; have over 1,000, &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; have from 200 to over 1,400 and &quot;M. gulosa&quot; have nearly 1,600. A colony can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony&#x27;s impending demise.

Workers are known to produce their own eggs, but these eggs are unfertilised and hatch into male ants. There is a chance of workers attacking a particular individual who has successfully produced male offspring due to a change in a workers cuticular hydrocarbon; cuticular hydrocarbons are believed to play a vital role in the regulation of reproduction. However, this is not always the case. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is one of several ant genera which possess gamergate workers, where a female worker is able to reproduce with mature males when the colony is lacking a queen. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; workers are highly fertile and can successfully mate with males. A colony of &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; without a queen was collected in 1998 and kept in captivity, during which time the gamergates produced viable workers for three years. Ovarian dissections showed that three workers of this colony mated with males and produced female workers. Queens have bigger ovaries than the workers, with 44 ovarioles while workers have 8 to 14. Spermatheca is present in &quot;M. gulosa&quot; workers, based on eight dissected individuals showing a spermatheca structurally similar to those found in queens. These spermathecas did not have any sperm. Why the queen was not replaced is still unknown.

===Vision===

While most ants have poor eyesight, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants have excellent vision. This trait is important to them, since &quot;Myrmecia&quot; primarily relies on visual cues for navigation. These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away. Winged alates are only active during the day, as they can see better. Members of a colony have different eye structures due to each individual fulfilling different tasks, and nocturnal species have larger ommatidia in comparison to those that are active during the day. Facet lenses also vary in size; for example, the diurnal species &quot;M. croslandi&quot; has a smaller lens in comparison to &quot;M. nigriceps&quot; and &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; which have larger lenses. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants have three photoreceptors that can see UV light, meaning they are capable of seeing colours that humans cannot. Their vision is said to be better than some mammals, such as cats, dogs or wallabies. Despite their excellent vision, worker ants of this genus find it difficult to find their nests at night, due to the difficulty of finding the landmarks they use to navigate. They are thus more likely to return to their nests the following morning, walking slowly with long pauses.

===Sting===

&quot;Myrmecia&quot; workers and queens possess a sting described as &quot;sharp in pain with no burning.&quot; The pain may last for several minutes. In the Starr sting pain scale, a scale which compares the overall pain of hymenopteran stings on a four-point scale, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; stings were ranked from 2–3 in pain, described as &quot;painful&quot; or &quot;sharply and seriously painful&quot;. Unlike in honeybees, the sting lacks barbs, and so the stinger is not left in the area the ant has stung, allowing the ants to sting repeatedly without any harm to themselves. The retractable sting is located in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in some species, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Examined workers of larger species have long and very potent stingers, with some stings measuring .

==Interaction with humans==
&quot;Myrmecia&quot; is one of the best-known genera of ants. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants usually display defensive behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as &quot;M. tarsata&quot;, are timid, and the workers retreat into their nest instead of pursuing the intruder. If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of their nest to attack and kill the intruder. Some species, particularly those of the &quot;M. nigrocincta&quot; and &quot;M. pilosula&quot; species groups, are capable of jumping several inches when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. &quot;M. inquilina&quot; is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.

Fatalities associated with &quot;Myrmecia&quot; stings are well known, and have been attested to by multiple sources. In 1931 two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from &quot;M. pilosula&quot; or &quot;M. pyriformis&quot;. Another fatality was reported in 1963 in Tasmania. Between 1980 and 2000, there were six recorded deaths, five in Tasmania and one in New South Wales. Four of these deaths were due to &quot;M. pilosula&quot;, while the remaining two died from a &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; sting. Half of the victims had known ant-sting allergies, but only one of the victims was carrying adrenaline before being stung. Most victims died within 20 minutes of being stung, but one of the victims died in just five minutes from a &quot;M. pyriformis&quot; sting. No death has been officially recorded since 2003, but &quot;M. pilosula&quot; may have been responsible for the death of a man from Bunbury in 2011. Prior to the establishment of a desensitisation program, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; stings caused one fatality every four years.

===Venom===
Each &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species has different venom components, so people who are allergic to ants are advised to stay away from &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, especially from species they have never encountered before. Based on five species, the median lethal dose (LD50) is 0.18–0.35 mg/kg, making it among the most toxic venoms in the insect world. The toxicity of the venom may have evolved due to the intense predation by animals and birds during the day, since &quot;Myrmecia&quot; is primarily diurnal. In Tasmania, 2–3% of the human population is allergic to &quot;M. pilosula&quot; venom. In comparison, only 1.6% people are allergic to the venom of the western honeybee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;), and 0.6% to the venom of the European wasp (&quot;Vespula germanica&quot;). In a 2011 Australian ant-venom allergy study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, 265 of the 376 participants in the study reacted to the sting of several &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species. Of these, the majority of patients (176) reacted to &quot;M. pilosula&quot; venom and to those of several other species. In Perth, &quot;M. gratiosa&quot; was responsible for most cases of anaphylaxis due to ant stings, while &quot;M nigriscapa&quot; and &quot;M. ludlowi&quot; were responsible for two cases. The green-head ant (&quot;Rhytidoponera metallica&quot;) was the only ant other than &quot;Myrmecia&quot; species to cause anaphylaxis in patients. Dogs are also at risk of death from &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants; renal failure has been recorded in dogs experiencing mass envenomation, and one dog was euthanised due to its deteriorating health despite treatment. Sensitivity is persistent for many years. Pilosulin 3 has been identified as a major allergen in &quot;M. pilosula&quot; venom, while pilosulin 1 and pilosulin 4 are minor allergens.

===Sting treatment===
The nature of treatment for a &quot;Myrmecia&quot; sting depends on the severity of stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat &quot;Myrmecia&quot; stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. &quot;Carpobrotus glaucescens&quot; is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.

Emergency treatment is only needed if a person is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to &quot;M. pilosula&quot; stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of &quot;M. pilosula&quot; venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.

Before venom immunotherapy, whole-body extract immunotherapy was widely used due to its apparent effectiveness, and it was the only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on &quot;Myrmecia&quot; sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against &quot;Myrmecia&quot; venom.

===Prevention===
&quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants are frequently encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. They defend their nests aggressively, so visible nests should be avoided. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes can reduce the risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants&#x27; presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low &quot;Myrmecia&quot; populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.

==Human uses==
Due to their large mandibles, &quot;Myrmecia&quot; ants have been used as surgical sutures to close wounds. 

== Cultural representations ==
The ant is featured on a postage stamp and on an uncirculated coin which are part of the &quot;Things That Sting&quot; issue by Australia Post, and &quot;M. gulosa&quot; is the emblem for the Australian Entomological Society. &quot;Myrmecia&quot; famously appears in the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s major work, &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, as a paradigmatic example of strife and constant destruction endemic to the &quot;will to live&quot;.

Notable Australian poet Diane Fahey wrote a poem about &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, which is based on Schopenhauer&#x27;s description, and a music piece written by German composer Karola Obermüller was named after the ant.

<text>Reginald Ashley Caton (1897–1971) was an English publisher. He appears as a literary character, especially in novels by Kingsley Amis.

In 1924, he founded the Fortune Press in London, specialising in gay erotica. Repeated legal difficulties saw his prosecution for obscene libel in 1934.

Caton is celebrated for obtaining the rights to Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;18 Poems&quot;, which he published in 1934, with repercussions for the poet. During the war years, he first rejected Philip Larkin&#x27;s first novel &quot;Jill&quot; (for obscenity), but finally published it in 1946, as he did his poetry collection, &quot;The North Ship&quot;. No manuscript version of &quot;Jill&quot; has survived.

Caton also published, for example, Nicholas Moore and Wrenne Jarman. Experts have concluded that there was no literary, rather than business, consistency. In 1951, he published Bryan Magee&#x27;s first book, an anthology of poems entitled &quot;Crucifixion and Other Poems&quot;.

The Fortune Press was sold to Leonard Holdsworth of the Charles Skilton Publishing Group.

<text>Su Manshu (, 1884–1918) was a Chinese writer, poet, painter, revolutionist and translator; his original name was Su Xuanying (). Su had been named as a writer of poetry and romantic love stories in the history of early modern Chinese literature. But he was most commonly known as a Buddhist monk, a poetry monk, &quot;the monk of sentiment&quot; (pinyin: qing seng; simplified Chinese: 情僧) and &quot;the revolutionary monk&quot; (pinyin: gem-ing seng; simplified Chinese: 革命僧). Su was born out of wedlock in Yokohama, Japan in 1884. His father was a Cantonese merchant, and his mother was his father&#x27;s Japanese maid. His ancestral home was in Zhongshan city, Guangdong Province, China. He died at the age of 34 due to a stomach disease in Shanghai.

== Life and career ==

=== Education ===
Su had a good master of painting and language. He mastered many languages — English, French, Japanese and Sanskrit. In 1896, he went to Shanghai with his uncle and aunt to study in the British con-cession when he was thirteen years old. Later, in 1898, he went to Japan to study at the School of Universal Harmony (Da Tong School 大同學校) in Yokohama, Japan. In 1902, he continued to study in the special program for Chinese students at Waseda University ( 早稻田大學 ).

=== Buddhism ===
He became a Buddhist monk three times during his life; once at the age of 12 in 1895, later in 1899, and again in 1903, and adopted Su Manshu as a Buddhist name. He studied in Japan and traveled to many Buddhist countries including India, and Java. In 1895, Su fell ill and nearly died due to lack of care from his family, which resulted in his resorting to Buddhism. However, Su did not follow the rules of Buddhism so he was expelled. In 1898, Su suffered a serious setback in his romantic relationship with a Japanese girl named Jingzi. Jinzi&#x27;s family forced her to leave Su, but she could not bear the great pressure and soon died. After facing this suffering, Su resorted to Buddhism again as a spiritual consolation for a short period. In 1913, Su felt disappointed about the political and social situation, in which the Qing government perpetually banned anti-government remarks in the revolutionary newspaper. So he returned to the temple in Guangdong for the rest of his life.

=== Career ===
Su was the most famous prose translator and his masterworks include &quot;Selected poems of Byron&quot; and &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; In 1903, he serialized his incomplete translation of &quot;Les Miserable World&quot; in &quot;The China National Gazette ( 國民日日報 )&quot; and then published it in 1904. Su also translated quite a few poems by foreign romantic poets from Lord Byron and then published a collection of the translations entitled &quot;Selected Poems of Byron&quot; (&quot;拜倫詩選&quot;) in 1908. In 1911, some of these translations were published again in an anthology entitled &quot;Chao Yin&quot;(&quot;Voice of the tide&quot;). In 1911 or 1912, Su wrote and published his first as well as a most celebrated semi-autobiographical romance novel, &quot;Duan Hong Ling Yan Ji&quot; (&quot;The Lone Swan&quot;).

== Literature work ==

=== &quot;Duan Hong Ling Yan Ji&quot; ===

The &quot;Duan Hong Ling Yan Ji&quot; (Chinese: 斷鴻零雁記; pinyin: duàn hóng líng yàn jì) was written in classical literary styles and translated into English by George Kin Leung as &quot;The Lone Swan&quot; in 1929. The novel depicts tragic love stories between a young man and two young ladies, both of whom wholeheartedly fall in love with him. The young man is a monk just like Su, who cannot marry either of the two young ladies, which results in a tragic ending. The similarity between the novel with &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; has led scholars to conclude that Su was much influenced by it. And &quot;The Lon Swan&quot; is one of the forefathers of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies school.

=== &quot;Selected Poems of Lord Byron&quot; ===

The &quot;Selected Poems of Lord Byron (Chinese: 拜倫詩選; pinyin: bài lún shī xuǎn)&quot; was published in the Chinese empire Hsuantung the first year (in 1909) and translated into Chinese in the form of classical Chinese poetry such as &quot;The Isles of Greece&quot; and &quot;My Native Land, Good Night&quot;&quot;.&quot;

=== &quot;Les Miserables&quot; ===
The translation of &quot;Les Miserables&quot; was published in the Chinese empire Guangxu 29th year (in 1903). It was serialized in 國民日日報 (English: &quot;The China National Gazette&quot; ) with a translated title &quot;慘社會&quot; (English: Miserable Society) in Shanghai.

== Influences ==

=== New Culture Movement and May Fourth Movement ===
Su was involved in revolutionary activity against the Qing Dynasty writing articles and papers. His poems integrated the core of classical Chinese literature and his collocation influenced the New Culture Movement in the early years of the Republic of China. His novels echoed those of the May Fourth Movement writers in criticism of the traditional family. Like writers such as Hu Shi, Wu You and Ba Jin, Su depicted family as an arena beset with cruelty, where authorities abused the younger generations for their own self-interests. He showed how family authority can inflict pain on young people by preventing their desire for romantic love. Although he focused on the pains of the sentimental characters’ personalities, he advocated that individuals could pursue what they wanted.

<doc id="1057176" wikidata="Q1506864" url="?curid=1057176" title="George Anson (British Army officer, born 1797)">
<text>Major-General George Anson CB (13 October 1797 – 27 May 1857) was a British military officer and Whig politician from the Anson family.

==Early life==
Anson was the second son of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson, and his wife Lady Anne Margaret Coke, daughter of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham Hall, Norfolk. Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield was his elder brother.

He was educated at Eton College.

==Military and political career==

Anson entered the Army in 1814 as an ensign in the 3rd (Scots Fusiliers) Guards and served at an early age in the Napoleonic Wars and fought at the Battle of Waterloo.
He later sat as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Great Yarmouth from 1818 to 1835, for Stoke-upon-Trent from 1836 to 1837, and for Staffordshire South from 1837 to 1853 and served as Storekeeper of the Ordnance under Lord Melbourne from 1835 to 1841 and as Clerk of the Ordnance under Melbourne in 1841 and under Lord John Russell from 1846 to 1852.

==Indian appointment==
In 1853 Anson was promoted to the rank of major-general. The following year he was appointed to the command of the Madras Army in 1854, and early in 1856 became Commander-in-Chief in India. He was colonel of the 55th (Westmorland) Regiment of Foot from 12 December 1856. Since Anson&#x27;s prior military career consisted of a few months&#x27; active service as a subaltern in the Guards (admittedly including Waterloo), a decade on home service in London while also sitting in Parliament as an MP, and 26 and a half years on half-pay, these appointments caused disgruntled comment in some quarters and were presented as an example of &quot;Horse Guards Patronage&quot; at its worst. His decision to accept the Madras appointment caused surprise in English political and social circles, where he was noted mainly for his gentlemanly ways, his good looks and attractive wife, and his skill at cards.

==In India==
During his short period as Commander-in-Chief in India Anson caused resentment by showing bias against the East India Company&#x27;s army and its sepoys. He appointed all of his aides-de-camp from the Queen&#x27;s Army, from which he had come. He was quoted as stating that he could never see a sepoy sentry &quot;without turning away in disgust at his unsoldierlike appearance&quot;. The Governor-General Lord Canning commented that Anson &quot;was rather a disappointment - but that it would be very difficult to quarrel with anyone so imperturbably good tempered, and so thoroughly a gentleman&quot;.

Anson&#x27;s appointment as C-in-C coincided with the beginning of the period of tension and disaffection leading up to the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. On 23 March 1857 Anson told a parade of Indian officers of the Bengal Army that rumors that the government would interfere with their religious beliefs and caste were completely false. He called on the officers to satisfy the sepoys under their command that this was the case. Anson himself reported a week later that the greased cartridge issue was simply a pretext for protest, adding that &quot;the sepoys have been pampered - and have grown insolent beyond bearing&quot;. He did however order the postponement of target practice at musketry depots; which would have involved the actual biting of cartridges and was accordingly the immediate cause of distrust amongst the soldiers. While Anson appears to have realised the seriousness of the situation and to have ordered an analysis of the cartridge wrappings in question, he left the training centre at Ambala without taking more decisive action. &quot;Redress and inquiry were both inconvenient so the headquarters&#x27; camp marched to Simla&quot; commented the British Instructor of Musketry, left at the depot in the midst of swirling discontent amongst the sepoys there.

On 12 May Anson and his staff were at Simla when the news of the outbreak of the mutiny at Meerut and Delhi reached him. He immediately ordered that European troops take possession of the various arsenals in the Punjab but delayed his own departure for the centre of rebellion while logistical problems were resolved. Anson finally left Ambala for Delhi on 23 May at the head of three regiments of British troops and some sepoy units that he considered reliable. His intention was to join with the Meerut Brigade and press on to retake Delhi. However, Anson died of cholera four days into the march, at the age of 59. He was buried in Kurnaul (now Karnal). His body was later exhumed and taken back to England to be buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

==Character==
In spite of his personal charm Anson did not enjoy much professional respect amongst his fellow officers in Bengal. A staff colonel commented immediately after his sudden death that the sepoys had &quot;a great hatred for him, honestly thinking that he was commissioned to convert them&quot;. A more valid criticism was that his immediate response to the outbreak of the mutiny was a laborious one, at a moment when quick and energetic action could still have been decisive.

==Private life==
Anson married The Hon. Isabella Elizabeth Annabella Weld-Forester, daughter of Cecil Weld-Forester, 1st Baron Forester, and wife Lady Katherine Mary Manners, in 1830. They had three daughters: the first was Isabella Maria Katherine Curzon-Howe, Countess Curzon, the second was Alice Louisa, The Hon. Mrs. Wentworth-Fitzwilliam and the third Geraldine Georgiana Mary Hervey, Marchioness of Bristol, Isabella survived her husband by only a year and died in December 1858.

Anson was a prominent owner of racehorses: he won The Derby with Attila in 1842 and The Oaks two years later with The Princess.

==Other==
It has been asserted mistakenly that &#x27;Famous British Olympian Sir Matthew Pinsent is George&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson&#x27;, but in fact that was a different George Anson - the uncle of the subject of this article.

<doc id="1057178" wikidata="Q329826" url="?curid=1057178" title="Eystein Haraldsson">
<text>Eystein Haraldsson (; ); – 21 August 1157), also called Eystein II, was King of Norway from 1142 to 1157. He ruled alongside his half-brothers, Inge Haraldsson and Sigurd Munn. He was killed in the power-struggle against his brother Inge in an early stage of the civil war era in Norway.

==Origins==
Eystein was born, apparently in Scotland, the son of Harald Gille, who was king of Norway from 1130 to 1136, and a woman named Bjaðǫk. Harald was born and raised in Ireland or Scotland, and Eystein was born there. When Harald went to Norway in 1127 to press his claim to royal inheritance, Eystein did not go with him. However, Harald let it be known that he had fathered a son before coming to Norway.

==Reign==
Eystein first appears in the sagas in 1142, when several Norwegian lendmenn travelled west and fetched him back to Norway from Scotland. His mother came with him to Norway. There, he was recognised as king, and given a share of the kingdom with his younger brothers. The division of the kingdom does not seem to have been territorial, all brothers seem to have held equal regal status over all parts of the country. This period of their reign saw the establishment of an independent Norwegian Archiepiscopacy in Nidaros (Trondheim) in 1152.

The sagas &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; relates that at some point in the early 1150s, king Eystein went on a campaign to Scotland and England. He captured Harald Maddadson, earl of Orkney in Caithness, and forced him to ransom himself for a considerable sum. He then proceeded to loot along the Scottish and English coast, attacking Aberdeen, Hartlepool and Whitby, in a voyage reminiscent of the earlier viking expeditions.

==Civil war==
According to the sagas, relations between the three brothers were peaceful as long as the two younger brothers&#x27; guardians were alive. But as the younger brothers grew up, tensions arose. In 1155, a meeting between the brothers in Bergen resulted in fighting breaking out between the men of king Inge and king Sigurd, in which king Sigurd was killed. King Eystein was late in arriving for the meeting, and only approached the city after Sigurd was already dead. An uneasy settlement was reached between Inge and Eystein. The reasons for the fighting in Bergen remain disputed. According to the sagas, Eystein and Sigurd had plotted to strip Inge of his royal title and divide his share of the kingdom between them. Some modern historians doubt this version, seeing it as Inge&#x27;s excuse for his own aggressive actions. In any event, peace between Inge and Eystein did not hold for long after the events of 1155. In 1157, both sides gathered their forces for a confrontation. Inge&#x27;s forces outnumbered Eystein&#x27;s, and when they met, on the west coast near Moster, Eystein&#x27;s forces melted away. Eystein was forced to flee, over land to Viken (the Oslofjord-area). Abandoned by his own men, he was caught, somewhere in the area of present-day Bohuslän, and killed by his captors. Whether or not king Inge ordered his killing seems to have been a disputed question at the time. Eystein&#x27;s body was buried in the church of &quot;Foss&quot; in Tunge Hundred. According to Heimskringla, the local population of the area started worshipping Eystein as a saint.

==Aftermath==
After Eystein&#x27;s death, his supporters rallied around the young Haakon the Broadshouldered, Sigurd Munn&#x27;s son, Eystein&#x27;s nephew. They continued the war against king Inge, in an early stage of the so-called &quot;civil war era&quot;, which was to last on and off until 1240. The sagas draw a rather negative picture of both Eystein and his brother Sigurd, generally choosing to portray Inge as the just ruler of the three brothers. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; states of Eystein:

:&quot;King Eystein was dark and dingy in complexion, of middle height, and a prudent able man; but what deprived him of consideration and popularity with those under him were his avarice and narrowness&quot;.

Eystein was married to Ragna Nikolasdottir, a Norwegian gentlewoman. His bastard son Eystein Meyla was proclaimed king by the Birkebeiner party in 1176, but was defeated and killed the year after.

==Sources==
The main sources to Eystein&#x27;s reign are the kings&#x27; sagas &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; and &quot;Ágrip&quot;. The three former base at least part of their account on the older saga &quot;Hryggjarstykki&quot;, which was written some time between 1150 and 1170, and was thus a near-contemporary source. This saga itself has not been preserved.

It is included as the fourth track on their eighth album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) and was released as a single in the United States. With lyrics written by bassist Roger Waters, guitarist David Gilmour shares lead vocals with keyboardist Richard Wright (his last until &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot; on the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;The Division Bell&quot;).

The lyrics deal with the passage of time. Waters got the idea when he realised he was no longer preparing for anything in life, but was right in the middle of it. He has described this realisation taking place at ages 28 and 29 in various interviews. It is noted for its long introductory passage of clocks chiming and alarms ringing. The sounds were recorded in an antique store made as a quadrophonic test by engineer Alan Parsons, not specifically for the album.

The album track also includes a reprise of the song &quot;Breathe&quot;. It is the only song on the album to credit all four principal members for songwriting, and the last to do so in the band&#x27;s discography.

==Composition==
&quot;Time&quot; is in the key of F♯ minor. Each clock at the beginning of the song was recorded separately in an antiques store. These clock sounds are followed by a two-minute passage dominated by Nick Mason&#x27;s drum solo, with rototoms and backgrounded by a &quot;tick-tock&quot; sound created by Roger Waters picking two muted strings on his bass. David Gilmour sings lead on the verses, while Richard Wright sings lead on the bridges with female singers and Gilmour providing backup vocals. The song&#x27;s lyrics deal with Roger Waters&#x27; realization that life was not about preparing yourself for what happens next, but about grabbing control of your own destiny. The recording was recorded quadraphonically by sound engineer Alan Parsons in an antique shop and begin with a homage to the song &quot;Klingklang&quot; (1971/1972) by the group Kraftwerk, or rather, are reminiscent of it.

According to an interview by Phil Taylor in 1994, David Gilmour had been using a Lexicon PCM-70 to store the circular delay sounds heard in &quot;Time&quot;, which could duplicate the kind of echo he used to get from his old Binson echo unit.

The verse chords cycle through F♯ minor, A major, E major, and F♯ minor again. During this section, Gilmour&#x27;s guitar and Wright&#x27;s keyboards are panned to the extreme right and left of the stereo spectrum, respectively. Gilmour sings lead during this section.

The bridge section, with Wright singing lead, has a notably &quot;thicker&quot; texture, with the female backing vocalists singing multi-tracked &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs&quot; throughout, and Gilmour singing harmony with Wright in the second half. The chords of this section are D major seventh to A major ninth, which is repeated. The second half progresses from D major seventh to C♯ minor, then B minor to E major.

The first bridge leads to a guitar solo by Gilmour, which plays over the verse and bridge progressions. The solo is followed by another verse sung by Gilmour. When the bridge is repeated, it does not conclude on E major as before. Instead, the B minor leads to an F major chord, while Waters&#x27;s bass stays on B, resulting in an unusual dissonance as a transition to the key of E minor for &quot;Breathe (Reprise)&quot;.

Pink Floyd performed the song live from 1972 to 1975, and after the departure of Waters, from 1987 to 1994. Waters began performing the song in his solo concerts, singing the verses himself, beginning in 1999 with In the Flesh and again with The Dark Side of the Moon Live from 2006 to 2008 (occasionally featuring guest appearances from Nick Mason) and the Us + Them Tour from 2017 to 2018. Gilmour has performed the song live on every one of his solo tours since Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Pulse&quot; tour, with the late Richard Wright sharing vocals until his death.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, Loyd Grossman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Time&quot; a positive review, describing the track as &quot;a fine country-tinged rocker with a powerful guitar solo by David Gilmour&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Louder Sound&quot; ranked the song number nine and number five, respectively, on their lists of the 50 greatest Pink Floyd songs.

==Film==
During live performances, the band back-projected a specially-commissioned, animated film by Ian Emes. The film was subsequently included as an extra on the &quot;Pulse&quot; DVD.

==Certifications==


== Roger Waters version ==
&quot;Time&quot; is a single by English musician and Pink Floyd cofounder Roger Waters, which serves as the second single to his album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Redux&quot;, a full re-recording of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

Around early 2023, Waters announced that in celebration of the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, he would be releasing a full-length re-recording of the record not featuring the rest of Pink Floyd that would try and re-address the political and emotional statements made on that record. The record&#x27;s name, cover, and lead single, &quot;Money&quot; was released on 21 July 2023. &quot;Time&quot; would be released 2 months later alongside a lyric video on 24 August 2023.

Similar to lead single &quot;Money&quot;, Waters strips back much of the psychedelic instrumentation and heavily slows it down from the original, putting a greater emphasis on Waters&#x27; crooning vocals, atmospheric production, and in general a more mellow sound.

=== Personnel ===
* Roger Waters – vocals
* Gus Seyffert – bass, guitar, percussion, keys, synth, backing vocals
* Joey Waronker – drums, percussion
* Jonathan Wilson – guitars, synth, organ
* Johnny Shepherd – organ, piano

<doc id="1057197" wikidata="Q617045" url="?curid=1057197" title="Medusa (Annie Lennox album)">
<text>Medusa is the second solo studio album by Scottish singer Annie Lennox, released on 6 March 1995 by RCA Records. It consists entirely of cover songs. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and peaked in the United States at number 11, spending 60 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has since achieved double platinum status in both the United Kingdom and the United States. As of 2018, &quot;Medusa&quot; had sold over six million copies worldwide.

The album was nominated for Best Pop Album at the Grammy Awards of 1996. Lennox won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her work on the first single released from &quot;Medusa&quot;, &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s&#x27;, which was released in February 1995 to critical acclaim. Entering the UK Singles Charts at number two, the single is Lennox&#x27;s highest-charting single in the United Kingdom to date. A further three singles were released during 1995 – &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot; and &quot;Something So Right&quot;.

==Background and recording==

Like her debut solo album, &quot;Diva&quot;, Lennox once again worked with record producer Stephen Lipson on &quot;Medusa&quot;. Four tracks that Lennox recorded for &quot;Medusa&quot; and were ultimately cut from the album&#x27;s final take were released elsewhere. B-sides releases include a version of &quot;Heaven&quot;, originally by The Psychedelic Furs, a recording of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot;, and a cover of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;(I&#x27;m Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear&quot;. Lennox also recorded a version of The Sugarcubes&#x27; &quot;Mama&quot;, which was included on the 1995 all-female compilation &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But a She Thing&quot;.

Lennox explains the origins of the album in the liner notes:
This album contains a selection of songs I have been drawn to for all kinds of reasons. They were not chosen with any particular theme or concept in mind—the method was more by instinct than by design. The work undertaken was truly a labour of love for me and I feel privileged to have been given this opportunity.
Regarding &quot;Medusa&quot; and the nature of its cover versions, &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; claimed that &quot;cover albums are notoriously hit and miss; even the best artists can sometimes stumble when straying from their original material and trying to reinvent somebody else&#x27;s. Lennox is a masterful interpreter of other artists&#x27; tunes, getting to the heart of the songs and delivering one stunning vocal performance after another. Lennox imbues each of these songs her own distinct flavor. Even though the songs come from different eras and there is a vast stylistic diversity, the album is tightly cohesive.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Medusa&quot; was released in March 1995 and became a &quot;substantial hit&quot; for Lennox, with music commentators claiming that the album was a &quot;worthy successor&quot; to her debut solo album, &quot;Diva&quot; which was released in 1992. Whilst &quot;Medusa&quot; did not match the acclaim and success that &quot;Diva&quot; achieved, the album was still well received, becoming a substantial commercial success. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and in Canada, and reached number eleven on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot; charts, achieving double-platinum in all three countries. &quot;Medusa&quot; was a Top 10 album over Europe and in other parts of the world. Both &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s and &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; were included on Lennox&#x27;s 2009 greatest-hits album &quot;The Annie Lennox Collection&quot;. As of 2018, &quot;Medusa&quot; had sold over six million copies worldwide.

The album yielded four singles in the United Kingdom: &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s&#x27; (which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 2, becoming Lennox&#x27;s highest-peaking solo single), &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot; and &quot;Something So Right&quot;. &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; claimed that &quot;The Lover Speaks&#x27; recording of &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s did no more than graze the lower reaches of the pop chart, and was soon forgotten&quot; until Lennox recorded and released the track as a single, claiming that the song&#x27;s &quot;idiosyncrasies play right into her [Lennox] strengths. Lennox and producer Stephen Lipson turn the inventive composition into a piece of epic grandeur, with Lennox delivering a dazzling vocal performance, arguably the finest of her career.&quot; &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video, and Lennox, at the 1995 Grammy Awards, won the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the song.

Citing the poor success of the three singles in the American music market that followed &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s, &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; argued that Lennox may have achieved considerably more success in the singles markets &quot;if she&#x27;d released a couple of the catchier up-tempo tracks instead of all ballads&quot;.

The album was nominated for Best Pop Album at the Grammy Awards of 1996, losing to &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot; by Joni Mitchell. Lennox took home the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance award for her work on the first single, &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s. This album was re-released in late 1995 in a double jewel case containing the album &quot;Medusa&quot; and a nine-track bonus CD featuring the studio version of Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Something So Right&quot; (with Simon guesting on vocals and guitar) and eight tracks recorded live from the concert in Central Park: &quot;Money Can&#x27;t Buy It&quot;, &quot;Legend in My Living Room&quot;, the Eurythmics singles &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot;, &quot;You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot;, along with &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Little Bird&quot; and &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot;.

==Commercial performance==

In her native Scotland, it debuted at number one on the national albums chart, spending a combined total of forty four weeks within the Scottish Top 100 Albums Chart. Likewise, in the United Kingdom, it also debuted atop the UK Albums Chart, spending a total of fifty-four weeks within the UK Top 100. Additionally, it debuted at number thirty-eight on the Official Vinyl Albums Chart in the United Kingdom in March 2018. &quot;Medusa&quot; peaked at number eleven on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot; Albums Chart, spending a total of sixty weeks on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;.

Elsewhere, the album debuted at number one in Canada and number two in both Austria and Italy. It reached the top ten in a number of territories such as Germany, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and New Zealand. Since its release, &quot;Medusa&quot; has sold over 6 million copies worldwide as of 2018, and achieved double platinum certification in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The album was also awarded double platinum status in both Canada and Ireland, indicating sales in excess of both 200,000 and 30,000 copies respectively. It achieved Gold certification status in Australia, Argentina, Austria, France, Germany and Spain.

==Awards and accolades==

Lead single &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards and was nominated for Best British Single at the 1996 Brit Awards. Despite missing out on the award for Best British Single, Lennox won the award for Best British Female for the second time.

==Critical reception==
Professional reviews for &quot;Medusa&quot; were mixed, ranging from favourable to outright hostile. AllMusic notes that critics &quot;savaged&quot; the album upon release: &quot;Trouser Press&quot; was probably the most severe in its criticism, characterising Lennox&#x27;s interpretations of classic material as &quot;obvious&quot;, &quot;milquetoast&quot; and &quot;willfully wrongheaded&quot;. Reviewer Ira Robbins did single out the track &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s for genuine, if backhanded, praise: &quot;The only song here that benefits from her ministrations is &#x27;No More &quot;I Love You&#x27;s, a minor 1986 hit for Britain&#x27;s otherwise forgotten The Lover Speaks, and that&#x27;s only by dint of the original&#x27;s obscurity.&quot;

Meanwhile, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a more favourable, though still mixed review:

Annie Lennox called her justifiably popular solo debut &quot;Diva&quot;, but it&#x27;s actually on the follow-up effort &quot;Medusa&quot; that she really starts acting like one. This wildly uneven album of cover versions starts with perhaps its highest point — a truly wonderful interpretation of &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s, a relatively obscure British hit by the Lover Speaks. Unfortunately, Lennox doesn&#x27;t work the same magic with more familiar material like Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Take Me to the River&quot; and Procol Harum&#x27;s &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;.
