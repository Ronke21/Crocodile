<text>The Souls was a small loosely-knit but distinctive elite social and intellectual group in the United Kingdom from 1885 to the turn of the century. Many of the most distinguished British politicians and intellectuals of the time were members. The original group of Souls reached its zenith in the early 1890s and had faded out as a coherent clique by 1900.

==Formation==
The group formed as a response to the damper on social life caused by the political tension of the Irish Home Rule debate. Existing social circles were rent by angry arguments between proponents and opponents of the Gladstone ministry&#x27;s efforts in 1886 to bring about full Home Rule. Many people in society wanted a salon where they could meet without fighting about politics. Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, a member of the group, described the aims and objectives of The Souls, and above all, of what they wanted to avoid.In my disappointment about Egypt I turned with redoubled zest to my social pleasures of the year before, and at this time saw much of that interesting group of clever men and pretty women known as the Souls, than whom no section of London Society was better worth frequenting, including as it did all that there was most intellectually amusing and least conventional. It was a group of men and women bent on pleasure, but pleasure of a superior kind, eschewing the vulgarities of racing and card-playing indulged in by the majority of the rich and noble, and looking for their excitement in romance and sentiment.

The name reportedly came from Lord Charles Beresford, who said: &quot;You all sit and talk about each other&#x27;s souls—I shall call you the &#x27;Souls&#x27;&quot;.

==Members==
The original Souls included the following people. It is important to note that most or perhaps all of the women in this list were members of The Souls on their own merits before they married other members.

===The Balfours===
* Arthur Balfour (1848–1930), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, 1902–1905
* Edith Sophy Balfour (1865–1948), who was Alfred Lyttelton&#x27;s second wife. A novelist, playwright, World War I-era activist, and Justice of the Peace, in August 1917 she was among the first people honoured with the Order of the British Empire by King George V, for her work with refugees.

===The Wyndhams===
Percy Wyndham, his wife, Madeline Caroline Frances Eden Campbell, their two sons and three daughters and the children&#x27;s spouses were all original members of The Souls. Through their mother, the children were descended from Irish nationalist Lord Edward FitzGerald. Wyndham commissioned the now-famous painting of his daughters, &quot;The Wyndham Sisters&quot; by John Singer Sargent. The trio are the centre of the 2014 book &quot;Those Wild Wyndhams&quot; by Claudia Renton.

*Hon. Percy Scawen Wyndham (1835–1911) was a soldier, Conservative Party politician, collector and intellectual. He held the same seat in Parliament from 1860 to 1885.
* Madeline Caroline Frances Eden Campbell Wyndham, (1846–1920) married the Hon. Percy Scawen Wyndham in 1860. Through her, their children were descended from Irish nationalist Lord Edward FitzGerald.
*George Wyndham, (1863–1913), the Wyndhams&#x27; elder son, served in the Coldstream Guards, became private secretary to Arthur Balfour and in 1889, was elected unopposed to a seat in the House of Commons that he held until his death in 1913. He served as Under-Secretary of State for War, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and then was taken into the Cabinet and sworn a member of the Privy Council in 1902. He furthered the 1902 Land Conference and saw the transformative Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 into law. Within years of the Acts, former tenants owned most of the land, thanks to support from government subsidies.
*Guy Percy Wyndham (1865–1941), the Wyndham&#x27;s second son, was an officer in the British army
* Madeline Pamela Constance Blanche Wyndham, (1869–1941), the Wyndham&#x27;s second daughter, married British Army officer Charles Adeane. After retiring from the Army, he was Justice of the Peace and Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire from 1915 until his death in 1943. In 1917, he was appointed President of the Royal Agricultural Society. The couple had seven children, two sons and five daughters. Their eldest daughter, Pamela, was the mother of professional jazz musician and broadcaster Humphrey Richard Adeane Lyttelton, also known as Humph.
* Pamela Adelaide Genevieve Wyndham Glenconner Grey (1871–1928), the senior Wyndhams&#x27; youngest child, was an author and editor. In 1919, Wyndham published &quot;Edward Wyndham Tennant: Memoirs of his Mother...&quot; her memories of her war-poet son, killed on the Somme in 1916. She published poems, prose and children&#x27;s literature, and edited poetry and prose anthologies. She numbered among her friends Henry James, Oscar Wilde, Edward Burne-Jones, and Edith Olivier. Her first husband was Margot Asquith&#x27;s brother, Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner. They had five children, including Stephen Tennant (1906–1987), known as the brightest of the Bright Young Things of 1920s London, and his elder brother, David Tennant (1902–1968) who founded the Gargoyle Club in Soho in 1925. Her second marriage, in 1922, to the eminent British Liberal statesman Sir Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, had no issue.
*Mary Constance Charteris, Lady Elcho (1862–1937), eldest daughter of Percy and Madeline Wyndham. She married Hugo Charteris, Lord Elcho, in 1883. They had seven children. One son died very young. Their eldest son, Captain Hugo Francis Charteris, Lord Elcho, married Lady Violet Catherine Manners, the daughter of Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland (see below) and Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland, in 1911. He and his brother Yvo Alan Charteris, were killed in action during the Great War. Their eldest daughter, Lady Cynthia Mary Evelyn Charteris, a prolific writer, married poet Herbert Asquith, second son of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. Their youngest child, Lady Irene Corona Charteris, married Ivor Windsor-Clive, 2nd Earl of Plymouth, son of Albert and Roberta Windsor-Clive, also members of The Souls.

===The Custs===
* Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Cust (1861–1917) served as a Member of Parliament for the Unionist Party, as Justice of the Peace for Bedfordshire, as Deputy Lieutenant of Bedfordshire, and as Justice of the Peace for Lincolnshire. He had a reputation as a brilliant conversationalist and a philanderer. Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland, was his mistress, and her daughter, Lady Diana Cooper, née Manners, was his child. In 1892, William Waldorf Astor invited Cust to edit the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;. He made it the best evening journal of the period, in part by enlisting such contributors as Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Cust rejected Astor&#x27;s own submissions and disagreed with his politics: Astor dismissed him in February 1896. Among Cust&#x27;s own works is the poem &quot;Non nobis &quot;. During World War I, Cust was active in propaganda on behalf of the British Government. In August 1914 he founded the Central Committee for National Patriotic Organizations. He married &#x27;Nina&#x27; Welby in 1893.
*Emmeline &#x27;Nina&#x27; Mary Elizabeth Welby (1867–1955), was an English writer, editor, translator and sculptor. She married fellow Soul Harry Cust in 1893. She aided him in much of his work, as when she helped with correspondence for the Central Committee for National Patriotic Organisations.

===The Grenfells===
*William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough (1855–1945) was a British athlete, sportsman, public servant and politician. Desborough was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1907, advancing to Knight Commander in 1908 and Knight Grand Cross in 1925. In 1928, he was admitted as a Knight of the Order of the Garter. He sat in the House of Commons from 1880 to 1905, when he was raised to the peerage. He was President of the Thames Conservancy Board from 1904 to 1937. He served with the London Chamber of Commerce, the Royal Agricultural Society, was a steward of Henley Royal Regatta, served as a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lieutenant. In 1919, the Desborough Committee investigated the causes of the London Police Strike of August 1918. Its recommendations resulted in the enactment of the influential Police Act of 1919. He was President of the Central Association of Volunteer Training Corps, a voluntary home-defence militia, from November 1914 until it was disbanded in 1920. From 1924 to 1929 he was Captain of the Queen&#x27;s Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard. From 1919 to 1929 he was chairman of the Pilgrims of Great Britain. He planned and oversaw the construction of the Desborough Cut, an artificial navigation channel on the River Thames, which was opened in 1935. He married Ethel &quot;Ettie&quot; Fane in 1887. (See below.) They had three sons and two daughters. Their eldest son, the poet Julian Grenfell, was killed in action in 1915. Their second son, Gerald William Grenfell, was killed about two months later. Their third son, Ivo George Grenfell, died in 1926 after a car accident. With no surviving male heirs the barony became extinct after Grenfell&#x27;s death. 
*Ethel &#x27;Ettie&#x27; Grenfell, née Fane, Lady Desborough (1867–1952) was the daughter of the Hon. Julian Fane, a diplomat and poet, the fifth and youngest son of John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, and Lady Adine Eliza Anne Cowper, daughter of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. Lady Adine died in 1868, a few months after the birth of a son (who did not live to adulthood). Fane died in 1870, leaving Ettie an orphan. She was 20 years old when she married William Grenfell. They welcomed gatherings of The Souls and many others to Taplow Court. Lady Desborough was a well-known celebrity and hostess whose guest lists included Henry Irving, Vita Sackville-West, Edward VII when Prince of Wales, H. G. Wells, Patrick Shaw Stewart, Edith Wharton, Oscar Wilde and Winston Churchill. From 1911 on, Ettie served periodically as Lady of the Bedchamber to Mary of Teck, Queen Consort to George V. She was said to be the confidante of six Prime Ministers: Rosebery, Balfour, Asquith, Baldwin, Chamberlain and Churchill. The Grenfells&#x27; lives were marked by the loss of all three sons, two in the Great War and one in an automobile accident in 1926. In 1915, their son Julian was fatally wounded when a splinter from an exploding shell landed in his brain. Ettie received the news from their daughter, who was serving as a nurse in France. Ettie and William travelled to Boulogne, France to be with their son. It took Julian 13 days to die, with his mother, father and sister at his side.

==The Coterie==

The Coterie, often considered to be the second generation of The Souls, was a celebrated group of intellectuals, a mix of aristocrats, politicians and art-lovers, most of whom were killed in the First World War. There were children of The Souls among them, notably Lady Diana Manners, daughter of Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland. Officially the youngest daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland, she was in fact the daughter of Harry Cust. She married one of the Coterie&#x27;s few survivors, Duff Cooper, later British Ambassador to France. After his death, she wrote three volumes of memoirs. Raymond Asquith, eldest son of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, was a member of the Coterie, but not out of sympathy with his stepmother, Margot Tennant Asquith. He was killed on the Somme.

<text>SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit is an international rail consultancy company. Headquartered in Derby, England, it is a subsidiary of AtkinsRéalis.

The company was originally formed as Interfleet Technology in April 1994 during the privatization of British Rail. Initially operating as a subsidiary of the British Railways Board, Interfleet became an independent entity following a management buyout in 1996. By 2011, the company had expanded to 22 offices worldwide and generated a turnover exceeding £50 million, engaging in thousands of assignments annually.

In 2011, SNC-Lavalin acquired Interfleet, leading to its rebranding as SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit in January 2016. The company now has regional subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, North America, Scandinavia, and Australasia, with offices in several major cities globally.

SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit offers a comprehensive range of services across the railway system, including rolling stock, infrastructure, signalling, communications, testing, and software development. Their clients span governmental and regulatory agencies, private manufacturers, operators, and investors. Notable projects include high-speed freight wagon design, modifications to British Rail Class units, technical analysis for Norwegian high-speed railways, and significant roles in the UK&#x27;s InterCity East Coast franchise and Australia&#x27;s Inland Rail programme.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Interfleet Technology was formed during April 1994 as part of the wider privatisation of British Rail. Interfleet originated from the former InterCity Fleet Engineering division of the British Rail engineering and technical headquarters, which managed the rolling stock operated by the then InterCity sector of British Rail. Between April 1994 and March 1996, the company traded as a subsidiary of the British Railways Board; however, in March 1996, Interfleet was privatised in a management buyout.

At the time of privatisation, Interfleet employed 99 staff and had one office in Derby; turnover was approximately £5 million. Having opted to pursue international clients, Interfleet established a series of regional offices for the purpose of supporting the individual needs of local markets, providing their services as consultants and subject experts. Interlink&#x27;s day-to-day operations emphasised the speed and effectiveness of communication with its varied client base.

By April 2011, Interfleet had expanded considerably, totaling 22 offices spread across the globe, and was reportedly generating a turnover in excess of £50 million. According to David Rollin (the Managing Director of Interfleet at the time), the company was engaged in excess of two thousand assignments per year on behalf of various clients at this time.

===Acquisition and rebranding as SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit===
During October 2011, it was announced that Interfleet would be acquired by SNC-Lavalin.

During May 2013, it was announced that Interfleet had been appointed to provide various services for the Intercity Express Programme, including direct technical support to Hitachi, assessment and certification services for compliance to relevant European and British legislation, as well as inspections and a production quality management audit in both Britain and Japan.

In January 2016, Interfleet Technology was re-branded as SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit. In conjunction with this rebranding, it was also integrated with other entities, including SNC-Lavalin&#x27;s Transit Engineers in Vancouver and Toronto along with the Transport Systems team in Montreal; these became a single organisation that operated under the new brand.

===Former logo===
The company logo for Interfleet has also changed throughout its history as shown below.
==Organisational structure and regional offices==
The international SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit divisional unit has regional subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, North America, Scandinavia and Australasia. The divisional unit has offices in Australia (Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney), Canada (Burlington, Montreal, Toronto &amp; Vancouver), Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), Norway (Oslo), Sweden (8 locations including Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm), the United Kingdom (Derby (HQ)), Edinburgh, Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Manchester) and the United States (Philadelphia &amp; New York City) and 1,000 staff.

==Service areas==
SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit provides services across the railway system, the major elements of which include rolling stock, infrastructure, signalling, communications, testing, and software development. The company works throughout all stages of the asset lifecycle, from feasibility, specification and procurement, through operations, maintenance and renewal. Services offered range from strategic railway management through to engineering and detail technical services.

==Clients and assignments==
The company operates within the global rail industry, serving governmental and regulatory agencies, private manufacturers, maintainers, operators, and others. Its work encompasses daily engineering and technical support, management of major projects like new train procurement, and providing strategic support to bidders for passenger rail franchises.

During the early 2000s, the company provided testing in conjunction with the KTH Royal Institute of Technology into the design of high speed freight wagons suitable for speeds of up to 160km/h. Around the same timeframe, Interfleet also shaped the bogie design of the new British Rail Class 185 diesel multiple unit; roughly one decade later, it designed the modifications for the mid-life refreshes of the similar British Rail Class 444 and British Rail Class 450 electric multiple units.

During September 2010, Interfleet was appointed to perform technical and safety analysis in support of the design of envisioned high speed railways being planned in Norway.

During November 2015, SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit, in partnership with Arup Group and Ernst &amp; Young, was appointed by the Department for Transport as its operator of last resort to takeover the operations of any train operating company in the United Kingdom at short notice should it be required. This function had previously been handled by Directly Operated Railways. In June 2018, the partnership trading as London North Eastern Railway took over the InterCity East Coast franchise from Virgin Trains East Coast.

During the late 2010s and early 2020s, SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit has been heavily involved in Australia&#x27;s Inland Rail programme; activities have included project management and the production of a framework for information management, contract compliance and resource management.

By late 2021, the company had secured a key role in European Train Control System (ETCS) deployment in Britain, providing both consultancy and signalling systems integrator functions; it has also been appointed as the Railway Systems Integration Partner for the East Coast Digital Programme as well as to deliver and operate the National ETCS Test Verification Validation and Integration Laboratory.

<text>The Mott MacDonald Group is a management, engineering and development consultancy headquartered in the United Kingdom. It employs over 19,000 staff in 150 countries. Mott MacDonald is one of the largest employee-owned companies in the world.

==History==
Mott MacDonald was formed in 1989 through the merger of Mott, Hay and Anderson and Sir M MacDonald &amp; Partners. Mott, Hay and Anderson was a transportation engineering consultancy responsible for projects such as the London Underground while Sir M MacDonald &amp; Partners was a water engineering consultancy with projects that included the Aswan Dam. The merger made Mott MacDonald one of the first international engineering, management, and development consultancies.

===Mott, Hay &amp; Anderson===
Mott, Hay and Anderson was founded as a private partnership between Basil Mott and David Hay in 1902, with the original firm name of Mott &amp; Hay. Prior to forming the original partnership, Mott and Hay had spent time building London tube railways and Hay had worked on the Blackwall Tunnel. Both engineers had worked together since 1888 on the City &amp; South London Railway under Sir Benjamin Baker and James Henry Greathead. Early projects included the reconstruction and extension of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR), the building and extension of the Central London Railway, the construction of lifts beneath St Mary Woolnoth church at Bank tube station, the underpinning of Clifford&#x27;s Tower, the reconstruction of Southwark Bridge and the widening of Blackfriars Bridge. Mott and Hay employed a young engineer called David Anderson as resident engineer for the latter project.

The firm also advised on proposals for underground railways in Sydney, Africa, and Russia. David Anderson was made a partner in 1920 after returning from army service. The firm was thereafter known as Mott, Hay and Anderson. During the 1920s, it designed the rolling bridge over the River Dee at Queensferry, the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle and the Trent Bridge in Nottingham. It also designed the enlargement of the City &amp; South London Railway tunnels and their extension past Camden Town and Clapham South to form the Northern line of the London Underground.

Both founding partners died in 1938, at which time most of the construction projects stopped. During the 1940s after World War II, it began expanding and working on additional projects, some of which including repairing of roads and bridges damaged or destroyed during the war, and, later, included the Victoria line of the London Underground and Australia&#x27;s Melbourne Underground Rail Loop. The firm continued in these fields until the merger with Sir M MacDonald &amp; Partners in 1989, at which time it was also working on the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France beneath the English Channel.

===Sir M MacDonald &amp; Partners===
Sir M MacDonald &amp; Partners was named after Murdoch Macdonald, a British civil engineer and later politician. The company formed out of affairs relating directly to British infrastructure development in Egypt between 1890 and 1930, in particular MacDonald&#x27;s involvement with Aswan Low Dam, starting in 1898. MacDonald was involved in the original construction of the Aswan Dam and later became an advisor to the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works after the dam was completed in 1902. He became closely associated with the development and first heightening of the Aswan Low Dam for the development of hydroelectricity.

MacDonald retired from his service with the Egyptian government in 1921 and returned to Britain where he began a partnership with Archibald MacCorquodale. In 1927, the two were later joined by PH East (also an engineer in the Egyptian government from 1907 to 1926) and Oswald Longstaff Prowde, at which time the name of the company was changed to Sir M MacDonald &amp; Partners. One of the first major projects of the partnership included the second heightening of the Aswan Low Dam, which continued from 1929 through design and construction stages until 1933. The firm continued on projects through its merger with Mott, Hay and Anderson in 1989.

===Post-merger===
Mott MacDonald began to expand after the 1989 merger. Early acquisitions included the consultancies of Husband &amp; Company as well as James Williamson &amp; Partners. These acquisitions brought Mott MacDonald&#x27;s total staffing to 3,300. Its 1994 acquisition of Ewbank Preece expanded its reach into the power and telecommunication fields, with its 2000 purchase of Cambridge Education Associates expanding its education consultancy. Additional early acquisitions included India-based firm Dalal Consultants in 2001, cost consultants Franklin + Andrews in 2002 and health practice HLSP in 2003. In 2007, Mott MacDonald bought Dutch firm Euroconsult BMB who specialized in international development and natural resource management.
2008 marked the first year that Mott MacDonald earned more internationally than it did in the United Kingdom, earning it recognition by &quot;New Civil Engineer&quot; as the &quot;International Consultant of the Year&quot;. Its top two international projects for that year were the Delhi Metro in India and Macau City of Dreams in China. The same year, the firm had 7,021 staff assigned to overseas projects, with 6,669 working overseas.

Mott MacDonald purchased Fulcrum Consulting in 2009 as a way of expanding its sustainable energy consultancy in the building sector. Fulcrum was a building services engineer consultancy and a founding member of the UK Green Building Council, specializing in green and eco-friendly engineering and design. Fulcrum was responsible for projects such as the Darwin Centre and considered a pioneer of low-energy building techniques. MacDonald also expanded to open principal offices in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Albania, and Serbia while opening smaller offices in throughout Africa. It also purchased Merz &amp; McLellan, a South African electrical engineering consultancy. 2009 also marked the opening of Mbombela Stadium, a stadium in South Africa for which Mott MacDonald designed the roof. In 2010, the firm added South African healthcare and development specialist HDA, and Australian engineering consultancy Hughes Trueman to its portfolio. In 2011, Mott MacDonald purchased Australian firm Mortimer Project Management and opened an office in Auckland, New Zealand.

Mott MacDonald continued to expand its international presence in April 2013 with the purchase of Habtec Engenharia Ambiental, a Brazil-based environmental consultancy with 80 people. Later the same month, it purchased PD Naidoo &amp; Associates, a consultancy based in South Africa with 550 people. The acquisitions added to the company&#x27;s previous purchases of Canadian consultancy Engineering Northwest, oil and gas firm Procyon, and the oil and gas operations of Mouchel.

In 2014, Mott MacDonald acquired AWT, a specialist water technology and consulting company based in New Zealand and Australia.

During 2014, Mott MacDonald acquired its UK water industry design and build joint venture partner Bentley Holdings Ltd (including its subsidiary company JN Bentley Ltd). The move was a natural progression in the highly successful 15 year partnership between the companies through the joint venture Mott MacDonald Bentley.

In 2015, Mott MacDonald and Hatch have announced that the Hatch Mott MacDonald (HMM) joint venture will be separated into two distinct businesses. HMM’s Canada business will become part of Hatch while HMM’s US business will become part of Mott MacDonald. HMM’s pipelines business, which operates in both Canada and the US, will also join Mott MacDonald.

==Projects==

Mott MacDonald has worked on many notable projects. It was the design engineer for Heathrow Terminal 5 sub-structures and foundations, as well as providing rail assurance services, tunnelling advice and project and program management. The project began in 2002, with construction being completed in 2008.

Mott MacDonald was the engineer and worked with Denton Corker Marshall on the design of the Manchester Civil Justice Centre which was completed in 2007. The Centre was the largest court complex in the United Kingdom built in a century and has won 26 awards for its design, including the &quot;Major Project of the Year Award&quot; in 2008 from Building.com. The Centre was designed and constructed to have minimal impact on the environment and included a narrow form, acoustic privacy, and natural ventilation. It was also featured in the book &quot;Microgeneration: Low Energy Strategies for Larger Buildings&quot; for its sustainability features.

In 2012, Mott MacDonald was chosen as the concept designer for engineering the New Mosaic Stadium.

Mott MacDonald was chosen to be part of the design-build team for a $41 million bridge rehabilitation project announced by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in January 2014. The project is scheduled to repair bridges in Niagara County in the western part of New York.

The $125 million contract for engineering the single bore tunnel segment of the Silicon Valley BART extension was awarded to a joint venture bid placed by Mott MacDonald and San Francisco based PGH Wong Engineering in January 2019.

Since 1998, Mott MacDonald has been providing waste water management for Union Pacific. In January 2018, a Mott MacDonald employee distracted by a cell phone call left a tank unattended for an hour while working at the railroad&#x27;s Albina Yard in Portland, Oregon, United States. The tank overflowed and released several thousands gallons of oil into the environment according to US attorneys. 1,800 gallons of the released oil was estimated to have been lost into the Willamette River. The former employee Robert LaRue Webb II was convicted with violating the Clean Water Act in October 2019 and was sentenced to a probation and a fine for negligently causing the oil release. The clean up and emergency response cost the railroad over $500,000. United States Coast Guard, EPA and Oregon Department of Environmental Quality assisted with the clean up.

<text>Frigyes Riesz (, , sometimes known in English and French as Frederic Riesz; 22 January 1880 – 28 February 1956) was a Hungarian mathematician who made fundamental contributions to functional analysis, as did his younger brother Marcel Riesz.

== Life and career ==
He was born into a Jewish family in Győr, Austria-Hungary and died in Budapest, Hungary. Between 1911 and 1919 he was a professor at the Franz Joseph University in Kolozsvár, Austria-Hungary. The post-WW1 Treaty of Trianon transferred former Austro-Hungarian territory including Kolozsvár to the Kingdom of Romania, whereupon Kolozsvár&#x27;s name changed to Cluj and the University of Kolozsvár moved to Szeged, Hungary, becoming the University of Szeged. Then, Riesz was the rector and a professor at the University of Szeged, as well as a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. and the Polish Academy of Learning. He was the older brother of the mathematician Marcel Riesz.

Riesz did some of the fundamental work in developing functional analysis and his work has had a number of important applications in physics. He established the spectral theory for bounded symmetric operators in a form very much like that now regarded as standard. He also made many contributions to other areas including ergodic theory, topology and he gave an elementary proof of the mean ergodic theorem.

Together with Alfréd Haar, Riesz founded the &quot;Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum&quot; journal.

He had an uncommon method of giving lectures: he entered the lecture hall with an assistant and a docent. The docent then began reading the proper passages from Riesz&#x27;s handbook and the assistant wrote the appropriate equations on the blackboard—while Riesz himself stood aside, nodding occasionally.

The Swiss-American mathematician Edgar Lorch spent 1934 in Szeged working under Riesz and wrote a reminiscence about his time there, including his collaboration with Riesz.

The corpus of his bibliography was compiled by the mathematician Pál Medgyessy.

<doc id="1073131" wikidata="Q2907884" url="?curid=1073131" title="Bob &amp; Rose">
<text>Bob &amp; Rose is a British television drama, originally screened in six one-hour episodes on the ITV network in the UK in Autumn 2001. It was produced by the independent Red Production Company, and was that company&#x27;s first prime-time drama for the ITV network.

&quot;Bob &amp; Rose&quot; was the inspiration for &quot;Jules &amp; Mimi&quot;, the fictional British television show featured in &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

==Production==
The series was written by Russell T Davies, who had previously been responsible for the much-discussed Channel 4 drama &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, another Red Production Company programme.

Bob was played by stand-up comedian and actor Alan Davies (no relation to writer Russell), who was at the time best known for his lead role in the BBC television mystery series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;. Rose was played by actress Lesley Sharp, who was nominated for the BAFTA and Royal Television Society Best Actress awards for the part. Although critically well-received, &quot;Bob &amp; Rose&quot; was not a huge success in terms of audience share for ITV, and the final two episodes were relegated from prime-time to later night slots.

==Plot==
The story follows the life of gay school teacher Bob who is fed up with the shallowness of the gay club scene in Manchester. A romantic at heart, Bob yearns to meet the right person and settle down. After yet another unsuccessful date, he meets Rose while they are both waiting for a taxi cab. Rose is disenchanted with her down-to-earth boyfriend and is smitten with Bob but she does not initially realise he is gay. Subsequent episodes chart their on-off love affair which is bedeviled by the activities of Bob&#x27;s best friend Holly. Holly (Jessica Hynes) is secretly in love with Bob and does everything she can to quietly interfere with Bob&#x27;s relationships with men because she does not want to lose him. Privately she is lonely and her only social life is through Bob and the gay clubs he visits. When Rose suddenly appears on the scene, Holly sees her as a threat, stalks her and may (or may not – the plot leaves the final matter in doubt) conspire with Bob&#x27;s former boyfriend Carl to split Bob and Rose up. A situation is created which suggests Bob may have had a one-night stand with Carl and Holly deliberately preys on Rose&#x27;s insecurities and creates further doubts. Eventually, she outright lies to Rose.

The story also follows the attempts of Rose&#x27;s mother to find a reliable boyfriend, and Bob&#x27;s campaigning mother who runs a fictional gay support group called &quot;Parents Against Homophobia&quot; (PAH!). The series is a gentle romantic comedy with each episode managing to end at an emotional or comic climax – as when Bob follows Rose down the street after they argue in a pub. He admits that their first heterosexual sex act has confused him but he wants to do it again. Equally confused, Rose turns towards the camera and unromantically says: &quot;Oh bollocks!&quot; and the credits roll.

The script takes some shrewd looks at emotions and motivations but also contrasts the different atmosphere and attitudes within gay and straight UK night clubs – as in the scene where a straight man cannot get into a straight club wearing trainers but the gay men can enter their club wearing skimpy satin sports clothes. One important scene which explains Bob&#x27;s disenchantment with the gay clubs comes when he is approached by an attractive man who talks only about physical acts. Bob, desperate to be regarded as an individual replies: &quot;I’m a Capricorn&quot;.

The series has an up-beat ending which manages to resolve issues for all the main characters – even Holly eventually learns from her mistakes and blossoms into a person in her own right. Bob and Rose find happiness and Carl gets an angelic dream date.

==Reception==
===Awards and nominations===
===Controversy===
As with &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, &quot;Bob &amp; Rose&quot; involved homosexuality as a key theme. The storyline involves a gay man falling in love with a woman and was loosely based on events in the real life of a friend of Russell T Davies. This storyline caused an uproar among some gay rights activists who felt that the series premise made it appear as if being gay was a choice or a phase, which then generated a strong counter-reaction by bisexuals who called the criticism unfair. However, the &#x27;Bob&#x27; character states categorically in the script that he is not bisexual saying: &quot;I was born gay, I’ll die gay and I’ll have a gay gravestone&quot;. He says that he was attracted to Rose as a person and not as a gender choice. He says he will &#x27;always look at men&#x27; but Rose is the only woman for him.

==Home media==
The entire series of six episodes was released on DVD on 15 April 2002 in the United Kingdom and on 17 February 2004 in the United States. The age certificate for the DVD in the United Kingdom is 15.

In 2020, the series was added to BritBox in the UK. This is, according to Russell T Davies, the first time the series has been made available either in rerun or streaming in the UK due to complex music licensing issues. For release on BritBox, Red Productions replaced most of the music and also edited a key scene involving the viewing of the football match.

<doc id="1073133" wikidata="Q45099" url="?curid=1073133" title="Marcel Riesz">
<text>Marcel Riesz ( ; 16 November 1886 – 4 September 1969) was a Hungarian mathematician, known for work on summation methods, potential theory, and other parts of analysis, as well as number theory, partial differential equations, and Clifford algebras. He spent most of his career in Lund, Sweden.

Marcel is the younger brother of Frigyes Riesz, who was also an important mathematician and at times they worked together (see F. and M. Riesz theorem).

==Biography==

Marcel Riesz was born in Győr, Austria-Hungary. He was the younger brother of the mathematician Frigyes Riesz. In 1904, he won the Loránd Eötvös competition. Upon entering the Budapest University, he also studied in Göttingen, and the academic year 1910-11 he spent in Paris. Earlier, in 1908, he attended the 
1908 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome. There he met Gösta Mittag-Leffler, in three years, Mittag-Leffler would offer Riesz to come to Sweden.

Riesz obtained his PhD at Eötvös Loránd University under the supervision of Lipót Fejér. In 1911, he moved to Sweden, where from 1911 to 1925 he taught at &quot;Stockholm University&quot;. 

From 1926 to 1952, he was a professor at Lund University. According to Lars Gårding, Riesz arrived in Lund as a renowned star of mathematics, and for a time his appointment may have seemed like an exile. Indeed, there was no established school of mathematics in Lund at the time. However, Riesz managed to turn the tables around and make the academic atmosphere more active.

Retired from the Lund University, he spent 10 years at universities in the United States. As a visiting research professor, he worked in Maryland, Chicago, etc.

After ten years of intense work with little rest, he suffered a breakdown. Riesz returned to Lund in 1962. After a long illness, he died there in 1969.

Riesz was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1936.

== Mathematical work ==

===Classical analysis===

The work of Riesz as a student of Fejér in Budapest was devoted to trigonometric series:

:formula_1

One of his results states that if

:formula_2

and if the Fejer means of the series tend to zero, then all the coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; are zero.

His results on summability of trigonometric series include a generalisation of Fejér&#x27;s theorem to Cesàro means of arbitrary order. He also studied the summability of power and Dirichlet series, and coauthored a book on the latter with G.H. Hardy.

In 1916, he introduced the Riesz interpolation formula for trigonometric polynomials, which allowed him to give a new proof of Bernstein&#x27;s inequality.

He also introduced the Riesz function Riesz(&quot;x&quot;), and showed that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the bound as for any 

Together with his brother Frigyes Riesz, he proved the F. and M. Riesz theorem, which implies, in particular, that if &quot;μ&quot; is a complex measure on the unit circle such that

:formula_3

then the variation |&quot;μ&quot;| of &quot;μ&quot; and the Lebesgue measure on the circle are mutually absolutely continuous.

===Functional-analytic methods===

Part of the analytic work of Riesz in the 1920s used methods of functional analysis.

In the early 1920s, he worked on the moment problem, to which he introduced the operator-theoretic approach by proving the Riesz extension theorem (which predated the closely related Hahn–Banach theorem).

Later, he devised an interpolation theorem to show that the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator in &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; The generalisation of the interpolation theorem by his student Olaf Thorin is now known as the Riesz–Thorin theorem.

Riesz also established, independently of Andrey Kolmogorov, what is now called the &quot;Kolmogorov–Riesz compactness criterion&quot; in &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;: a subset &quot;K&quot; ⊂&quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;(R&quot;n&quot;) is precompact if and only if the following three conditions hold: (a) &quot;K&quot; is bounded;

(b) for every there exists so that

:formula_4

for every 

(c) for every there exists so that

:formula_5

for every with |&quot;y&quot;| &lt; &quot;ρ&quot;, and every .

===Potential theory, PDE, and Clifford algebras===

After 1930, the interests of Riesz shifted to potential theory and partial differential equations. He made use of &quot;generalised potentials&quot;, generalisations of the Riemann–Liouville integral. In particular, Riesz discovered the Riesz potential, a generalisation of the Riemann–Liouville integral to dimension higher than one.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Riesz worked on Clifford algebras. His 1958 lecture notes, the complete version of which was only published in 1993 (), were dubbed by the physicist David Hestenes &quot;the midwife of the rebirth&quot; of Clifford algebras.

===Students===
Riesz&#x27;s doctoral students in Stockholm include Harald Cramér and Einar Carl Hille. In Lund, Riesz supervised the theses of Otto Frostman, Lars Gårding, Lars Hörmander, and Olof Thorin.

<doc id="1073135" wikidata="Q3303021" url="?curid=1073135" title="Maymunah bint al-Harith">
<text>Maymunah bint al-Harith al-Hilaliyyah (; ), was the eleventh and final wife of Muhammad. Her original name was Barrah (), which she changed to Maymunah—meaning &quot;good tidings&quot;—upon converting to Islam and marrying him, as his marriage to her marked the first time in seven years when he could enter his hometown of Mecca from Medina.

==Family==
Her father was Al-Harith ibn Hazn from the Hilali tribe of Mecca. Her mother was Hind bint Awf from the Himyari tribe in Yemen. Lubaba the Elder was her full sister. Her paternal half-sisters were Layla (Lubaba the Younger), Huzayla and Azza. Her maternal half-siblings were Mahmiyah ibn Jaz&#x27;i al-Zubaydi, Asma bint Umays (a wife of Abu Bakr), Salma bint Umays (a wife of Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib) and Awn ibn Umays. Ibn Kathir also mentions a tradition that Zaynab bint Khuzayma (a wife of Muhammad) was another maternal half-sister.

==Life==
Maymunah was first married to Abu Ruhm ibn Abd al-Uzza who later died. Not much is known about him.

In 629, Muhammad married her in a place known as Sarif, about from Mecca, just after the Lesser Pilgrimage. She was in her late 30s when she married him. Maymuna lived with Muhammad for three years until his death in 632.

Despite her position as a wife of the Prophet, Maymunah lived a humble and ascetic life. She performed Hajj annually along with Umrah, accumulating around 50 pilgrimages during her lifetime. Her dedication to family ties was also noteworthy; Aisha, praised Maymunah as one of the most pious and family-oriented among the wives of the Prophet.

Maymunah narrated several hadiths, offering insights into the Prophet’s practices of worship and household life. She described his night prayers, his method of performing ablution and ritual purification (ghusl), and rules on sadaqa. One of her famous contributions includes her narration of an incident where the Prophet consumed milk on the Day of Arafah, clarifying for his companions that he was not fasting that day. 

Maymunah also played a significant role in the emancipation of slaves, often offering prayers for them before granting their freedom.

==Death==

Maymuna is believed to have died in the month of Dhu al-Hijjah, 51 AH; January 671 CE. Her death date is debated however. According to Al-Tabari: &quot;Maymuna died in the year 61 AH (680–681 CE) during the caliphate of Yazid I. She was the last of the wives of the Prophet to die, and her age was then 80 or 81.&quot; However, Al-Tabari asserts elsewhere that Umm Salama outlived Maymuna. Abdullah ibn Abbas, her nephew, led her funeral prayer.

Ibn Hajar also cites a tradition implying that Maymuna predeceased Aisha: &quot;We stood on the walls of Medina, looking out … [Aisha said]: &#x27;By Allah! Maymuna is no more! She has gone, and you are left free to do whatever you like. She was the most pious of all of us and the most devoted to her relatives.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="1073139" wikidata="Q2661882" url="?curid=1073139" title="Cattistock">
<text>Cattistock is a village and civil parish in west Dorset, England, sited in the upper reaches of the Frome Valley, northwest of the county town Dorchester. The Dorset poet William Barnes called it &quot;elbow-streeted Cattstock&quot;, a comment on the less-than-linear village street. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 509.

==Parish church==
A church was built here in the 12th century by the monks of Milton Abbey, though this structure has not survived. The current church, dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, was rebuilt in the 19th century by architects Sir George Gilbert Scott and his son George Gilbert Scott Junior. The Perpendicular-styled tower was the work of the latter, and has led to the church being dubbed the &#x27;Cathedral of the Frome Valley&#x27;; he was also responsible for the porch, north aisle and vestry. A carillon of 35 bells was installed in the new tower a few years after its construction. This was the first carillon to be introduced to England and attracted hundreds of visitors to the valley, though the bells were destroyed by a fire in the tower on 15 September 1940. The fire also destroyed the very large clock, which previously almost spanned the width of the tower. In 1972 the Pevsner guide to Dorset architecture said that &quot;for the mid- to late-nineteenth century, this is the masterpiece amongst Dorset churches&quot;. The church is a Grade I Listed Building. 

==Chantmarle==

Nearly north of the village is Chantmarle, a house dating from the 15th century, with additions in the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries. It received its name – which means &quot;song of the blackbird&quot; in Norman French – from the Chauntmerles family, who lived on the site in the early 13th century. In 1910 Inigo Thomas designed new end wings and a terraced garden with ponds. In the late 20th century Chantmarle was used as a centre for police training. It then became a Christian retreat and wedding reception venue, but is now once more a private home.

==Cattistock Hunt==
The Cattistock Hunt is a foxhound pack established by a parson at Cattistock Lodge in the mid 18th century. It was given the name &#x27;The True Blue&#x27;.

The Hunt has been affiliated with all UK naval vessels named HMS Cattistock, including the latest to bear the name, HMS Cattistock (M31).

The village also has a close relationship with those named ships too and has hosted the ships&#x27; crews on many occasions.

An ensign and emblem shield of HMS Cattistock - a blue cornflower, the symbol of the Hunt&#x27;s colours and a wildflower local to the area - is displayed in the village church.

==Food festival==
Cattistock hosts a Dorset knob throwing event and the Frome Valley Food Festival every year on the first Sunday in May.

<text>Zerwikaptur is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several gentry families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
A legend about the origination of the coat of arms is used in the novel &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot; by Henryk Sienkiewicz, whereby a character Longinus Podbipięta managed to cut off the heads of three knights bearing the goat&#x27;s head on their arms with a single swing of his huge sword. Therefore he named his sword &quot;Zerwikaptur&quot;, literally meaning &quot;coif-snapper&quot;, and later got the coat of arms of this name. In fact, Zerwikaptur originated well before the times of the novel.

<text>Lieutenant Edward Wyndham Tennant (1 July 1897 – 22 September 1916) was a British war poet killed during the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
He was the son of Edward Tennant, who became Lord Glenconner in 1911, and Pamela Wyndham, a writer, and later wife of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon. His younger brothers were the eccentric Stephen Tennant and David Tennant, the founder of the Gargoyle Club.

Born at Stockton House, Stockton, Wiltshire, which his father had just leased from Major-General A. G. Yeatman-Biggs, Tennant was educated at Winchester College. At the age of seventeen he left school and joined the Grenadier Guards in the early weeks of the World War I.

Tennant was known to friends and family as &#x27;Bim&#x27;, but the origin of this nickname is unknown. It has been suggested that he was engaged before his death to Nancy Cunard, but a reliable source, Colin Tennant, 3rd Baron Glenconner, responded in a letter to a question on this point and stated that the suggestion was incorrect; Lois Gordon, Nancy Cunard&#x27;s biographer, in her extensive research, never came across any hint of such an alliance either.

==Death and memorial==
Tennant is buried at Guillemont in France in the Guillemont Road Cemetery, close to the remains of his friend and relative Raymond Asquith (eldest son of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith), who was killed the week before. The inscription on his gravestone reads: .

A memorial to Tennant, sculpted by Allan G. Wyon, was erected in Salisbury Cathedral. There are two inscriptions on the memorial, one above the low-relief portrait of Tennant, and one below.

The upper inscription reads: &quot;When things were at their worst he would go up and down in the trenches cheering the men, when danger was greatest his smile was loveliest.&quot;

The inscription below the portrait has the following wording:

<text>Fledg&#x27;ling Records is a British independent record label founded in 1991. The label has re-released some albums previously issued by Hokey Pokey Records which was also run by the Fledg&#x27;ling founder—David Suff.

<doc id="1073148" wikidata="Q4701736" url="?curid=1073148" title="Aksak coat of arms">
<text>Aksak is a Polish coat of arms of Tatar origin. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
Kasper Okińczyc was granted with a noble title by King Jan III Sobieski in 1683, after the Battle of Vienna, together with an estate called Luzinky. He was given also the command over the garrison of the city of Mścisław (modern Mstislav, Belarus), close to the border with Muscovy

The name of the coat of arms stems from Okińczyc&#x27;s personal nickname, possibly a Turkish language word &quot;aksak&quot; meaning lame. 
Possibly Okińczyc received a wound during the battle and started using the term as his nickname and later as a name of the symbol of his family.

==Blazon==

The blazon exists also with a heart pierced by an arrow, with blood drops.

==Notable bearers==
Notable bearers of this coat of arms include:

<text>Clara () is a town on the River Brosna in County Offaly, Ireland. It is the 10th largest town in the midlands of Ireland. The town had a population of 3,403 as of the 2022 census.

Clara&#x27;s local services include churches, schools, a branch of the Laois &amp; Offaly Education and Training Board, a library, doctor&#x27;s surgery, medical centre, pharmacies, health centre, family resource centre, shops, post office, credit union, hair and beauty salons, barbers, garages, pubs, eateries, a playground, public swimming pool, pitch and putt club, GAA club, and Clara Bog Visitor Centre. There is a Garda (police) station and fire station in the town, while the Midlands Regional Hospital is located approximately eleven kilometres away in Tullamore.

==Geography==
Clara is situated in the north of County Offaly near the border with County Westmeath, on the regional road R420 some 12 kilometres northwest of Tullamore. Clara Bog is located approximately 2.5 kilometres to the southeast of Clara town. Situated on a plain (&quot;Clóirtheach&quot; meaning plain or level place), the town is in reality an urban centre surrounded by a series of mini-villages. The town is connected to the River Shannon by one of its tributaries, the River Brosna. &quot;Clara&quot; is the modern name of what was previously known as the Barony of Kilcoursey and Parish of Kilbride. The earliest known map of Clara dates from the Ordnance Survey of 1838.

==History==
===Early history===

While the town as we know it today was established by Quakers in the mid-18th century, there is evidence of community habitation for some time. Situated on the Esker Riada, the ancient thoroughfare which connected the east and west coasts of Ireland, numerous ring forts are to be found in the countryside surrounding the town suggesting that the early settlement may have been a staging post for travellers. Just outside the town in Kilbride, the remnants of a 12th-century monastery testify to the existence of a religious presence. According to tradition this monastery was founded by St Brigid of Kildare (d.c 525 AD) and is linked by an ancient road to Durrow Abbey founded by St Colm Cille (St Columba). St Brigid&#x27;s original monastery, founded shortly after her religious profession – her first foundation, would have been constructed in wood and consisted of a number of buildings surrounding a central church. These buildings were replaced by stone structures in the 12th century. The original parish was named after St Brigid: Kilbride (from &quot;Cill Bhride&quot;: the Church of Brigid). The ruins of an ancient church are to be found not far from the monastery at the foot of a hill (Chapel Hill) and this may have been the original parish church.

===Development and industrialisation===
Politically the family which had dominion over the area was the Sinnach O&#x27;Catharniagh (Fox O&#x27;Carney) clan; they were referred to as the &quot;Muinter Tadgain&quot; (people of Tadgain). The O&#x27;Catharniagh were princes of Teffia (an area in County Westmeath). The ruins of their castle, Lehinch Castle, are to be found on a hill in Kilcoursey, less than a mile from the town centre. The McAuley family are also associated with the Barony of Kilcoursey. Mass rocks are also to be found in the hills outside the town, having provided secret places for Catholics to worship during the persecution which followed the Reformation.

The Fox family owned much of the district up until the 1650s. Following the involvement of the Chieftain, Hubert Fox in a rebellion in the 1640s – he was defending Catholic interests against the Puritan Oliver Cromwell who came to Ireland to suppress uprisings against English rule. Ironically, in 1599, Fox&#x27;s father, also Hubert, had signed an agreement of &quot;surrender and regrant&quot; with the English crown to avoid the complete destruction of his estates following the Nine Years&#x27; War: the lands were returned to Fox senior in recognition of his fealty. Hubert junior, however, was not so inclined, preferring to stand by the family&#x27;s traditional allegiance. Cromwell proved victorious and Fox lost his lands which were given to Samuel Rust, a Cromwellian soldier. He, in turn, sold the district to two families – the Armstrongs and the Bagots. The Armstrongs settled in the town and would eventually establish industries, including a linen factory. Andrew Armstrong (1727–1802) built the neo-classical Clara House on the west side of the town in the 1770s. One member of the Armstrong family, John Armstrong, uncle of Andrew, was Governor of Menorca and author of a history of the island in 1752. Andrew Armstrong died in 1802 and the estates were sold to the Cox family.

In 1825, the Goodbody family moved to Clara from Mountmellick and introduced industry into the town, trading under the name of J &amp; L F Goodbody. Buying flour mills at Erry and Charlestown, they developed the river Brosna and used it to harness power for their factories. In 1864 the Goodbodys started a jute factory at Clashawaun. The jute was imported from India and the resulting bags were exported worldwide. In the last decades of the 20th century, the factories declined and the last Goodbody factory closed in 1984. The family had provided the people of Clara with employment in a number of areas: factory work, domestic service and farming. Other industries in the town included flour mills, distilleries, a brewery, manufacturers of tobacco, soap, candles, and clothes together with food processing companies.

At the end of the 19th century and for much of the 20th century, the town&#x27;s prosperity led to a number of building projects. There are several stately houses in the town and surrounding countryside as the various members of the Goodbody family set up their households. Thanks to Catholic Emancipation in 1829 a more prominent Catholic church was built on the outskirts of the town in Charlestown, but this proved too small and in the 1880s the parish, now St Brigid&#x27;s Parish, built a neo-gothic church in the centre of the town on one side of the main square: a relic of St Brigid is preserved in the church. To cater for the needs of the townspeople, two religious orders founded communities and schools: the Franciscan Brothers arrived in 1821 and the Sisters of Mercy some years later. Other religious buildings in the town consist of St Brigid&#x27;s parish church for the Church of Ireland community (Anglican Communion) looking down over the fair green and the Friends&#x27; Meeting Hall (Quaker) which is no longer in use. As the town prospered so did social life, and a number of cultural and sporting associations were founded in the town.
===Death of Father Niall Molloy===

Father Niall Molloy (14 April 1933 - 8 July 1985) was a Catholic priest who was killed in mysterious circumstances in Kilcoursey House in Clara, County Offaly, the home of Richard and Therese Flynn. When the Garda Síochána arrived, they found that there were signs of violence in Flynn&#x27;s bedroom and that there was a large bloodstain on the carpet. The priest died the day after the wedding of the Flynns&#x27; daughter Maureen. Flynn was charged with manslaughter and with actual bodily harm, but the judge at his trial, a family friend, directed the jury to give a &#x27;not guilty&#x27; verdict. In 2011, a medical examination of brain tissue kept after the original post-mortem revealed that there was a high probability that the priest was alive up to six hours after the initial attack and therefore may have lived if medical help had been summoned. Molloy was parish priest of Castlecoote, County Roscommon at the time of his death.

==Transport==
Clara railway station opened on 3 October 1859, and located beside Railway View Housing Estate. It is on the main Dublin to Ballina / Westport / Galway railway line. Clara was once a railway junction, with a branch to Streamstown on the now disused Athlone–Mullingar link. There was also a railway junction west of Clara serving the Banagher branch line.
Clara is also served by the M6 Dublin/Galway motorway with junction 6 less than 5 minutes drive from the town centre.
In 2008 there was a proposal for a small regional airport in the area, which later fell through

==Sport==
Clara&#x27;s local GAA club is involved in Gaelic football and hurling from under 8 to senior level. Clara also has a soccer club and an athletic club. The town has two swimming pools, a pitch and putt club, and a powerlifting club. A golf driving range is located in the town also with the Esker Hills golf club located just outside the town. There is a local equestrian centre and sports centre also.

== Special Area of Conservation ==
Two kilometres from the town centre lies Clara Bog, a raised bog which contains rare flora. It was considered for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Clara Bog visitor centre is located beside the town&#x27;s library.
A bog boardwalk (Accessible from Ballinough, off Tullamore road) is very popular with local walkers but is virtually unknown to visitors. The boardwalk allows walkers to safely cross the surface of the bog. A much shorter, but more accessible bog boardwalk is also located 2 km from Clara on the main Rahan road.

<text>Boreyko is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
The symbol of a swastika was also popular with the nobility. Prior to Christianity, this sign was painted on the shields of knights. According to chronicles, prince Oleg who in the 9th century with his Rus Vikings had captured Constantinople, had nailed his shield to the cities gates, which had a large red Swastika painted on it. The noble house of Boreyko from Ruthenia also had swastikas as their coat of arms. The family had reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and their crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time. The origin of the family is tracked back to the eastern regions of today&#x27;s Ukraine. During several centuries the Boreyko noble families united against the Tsar Kingdom of Russia. 
==Blazon==

==Notable bearers==
Notable bearers of this coat of arms include: Borejko, Boreyko, Boyko, Borejka, Borzym, Radzichowski, Radziechowski.

During the Second World War families by these surnames living in the Polish–Lithuanian regions changed them in order to avoid persecution by the Soviet and/or Nazi authorities.

Alternative surnames : Bouejko, Bolejko, Borym, Radzikowski, etc.

<doc id="1073154" wikidata="Q17005745" url="?curid=1073154" title="Internal sin">
<text>Internal sin, in Christianity, is the idea that sin may be committed not only by outward deeds but also by the inner activity of the mind, quite apart from any external manifestation. Thought crimes were as old as heresy, but the Reformation&#x27;s alarms received new emphasis at the Council of Trent (Session XIV, chapter. v). The session, while reiterating that all mortal sins must be confessed, singled out the unspoken ones that &quot;sometimes more grievously wound the soul and are more dangerous than sins which are openly committed&quot;.

Three kinds of internal sin are usually distinguished by Catholics:
* &quot;delectatio morosa&quot;, the pleasure taken in a sinful thought or imagination even without desiring it;
* &quot;gaudium&quot;, dwelling with complacency on sins already committed; 
* &quot;desiderium&quot;, the desire for what is sinful.

== Biblical quotes==
* Matthew 5:28 &quot;But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart&quot;.
* Romans 6:12 &quot;Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires&quot;.

<text>Chalbury is a village in the English county of Dorset. It lies on the southern edge of Cranborne Chase within the East Dorset administrative district of the county, four miles north of Wimborne Minster and four miles west of Verwood. The village is sited on Chalbury Hill, the view from which has been described as &quot;one of the most fascinating in the county&quot;. The Dorset broadcaster Ralph Wightman wrote of the hill and its view:
:&quot;Here there is a hill which is only three hundred feet high but which manages to give a wonderful view over woodland, heath, fertile chalk and the distant Isle of Wight. This feeling of immense space seen from relatively small hills is a blessed peculiarity of Dorset.&quot;
The village has a population of 140 (2001). Journalist Mary Frances Billington was born at Chalbury in 1862, while her father was the rector at All Saints&#x27; Church.

== Governance ==
In the UK national parliament, Chalbury is within the North Dorset parliamentary constituency.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Chalbury is part of the Stour and Allen Vale ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

<doc id="1073172" wikidata="Q5882103" url="?curid=1073172" title="Naryn Castle, Meybod">
<text>The Naryn Castle (In Persian: نارین قلعه) or Narin Castle is a mud-adobe fort or castle in the town of Meybod, Iran. Built some 2,000 to 6,000 years ago, it has four towers and stands 40 meters (130 ft) high and contained a plumbing system. 

Naryn (or Narenj) Castle is common language for Mehrjerd Castle.

==Architecture==

The ruins of the structure stands 40 meters (130 ft) high from its base. Although built between 2,000 and 6,000 years ago, it contains what seems to be a type of plumbing system (made out of a kind of mortar called &quot;sarooj&quot;) which was built into its massive walls. Peculiarly similar in design to &quot;Ali Qapu&quot; palace of Isfahan, it has a terrace high on top of the structure whose circulation is provided by two helical stairwells (whose walls have caved in, making it inaccessible). The structure also has a large underground chamber (now filled by rubble), was possibly used as a prison. Four towers surround the entire compound, and a large gate furnishes access to a large courtyard.

This building has been built as an old fortress with three different floors, each for a different class of society.

Structures like Naryn Castle constituted the government stronghold in some of the older (pre-Islamic) towns of central Iran. Some of these castles incorporate mud bricks of the Medes period and of the Achaemenid and Sassanid dynasties.

Some believe that the Narin castles are descendants of ancient Zoroastrian fire-temples; some of the castles in Narin and Meybod, in Yazd province, are also called &quot;nareng&quot; castles (orange castles), possibly by folk etymology.

==Current conditions==
The castle at Meybod is currently under study but has not been faring very well. The structure seems to have been affected by numerous earthquakes throughout the ages.

<doc id="1073173" wikidata="Q3341305" url="?curid=1073173" title="Chaldon Herring">
<text>Chaldon Herring or East Chaldon is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset, about south-east of the county town of Dorchester. It is sited from the coast in the chalk hills of the South Dorset Downs. The highest point in the area is Chaldon Hill about to the south, overlooking the sea. In the 2011 census the civil parish had 59 households and a population of 140.

In 1086 in the Domesday Book, Chaldon Herring was recorded as &quot;Calvedone&quot; and, together with West Chaldon, appears in three entries.

The Herring family were landowners for a long period (as early as 1166 until at least 1372), so the village and parish appended their family name to the placename. Elizabeth Herring, daughter of John Herring of Chaldon Herring, was the great grandmother of John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford; the Herringham arms are displayed in the second grand quarter of Bedford&#x27;s coat of arms.

Chaldon Herring is notable for being the home of Llewelyn Powys and his wife, Alyse Gregory. In 1925 the couple moved to Dorset: firstly to the Coastguard Cottages on White Nothe and then to the nearby farmhouse Chydyok, where his two sisters, the poet and novelist, Philippa Powys, and the artist, Gertrude Powys, occupied the adjacent cottage. Various other writers and artists lived in the village at different times. These include the sisters Elizabeth Muntz, a sculptor and author, and Hope Muntz, a historian, who wrote &quot;The Golden Warrior&quot;; novelists Sylvia Townsend Warner and David Garnett; the poets Valentine Ackland and Gamel Woolsey; and the sculptor Stephen Tomlin.

The novelist Theodore &quot;T. F.&quot; Powys, older brother of Llewelyn, lived in Chaldon from 1904 until 1940, when he moved to Mappowder because of the war. Chaldon Herring was the inspiration for the fictitious village of Folly Down in his novel &quot;Mr Weston&#x27;s Good Wine&quot; and other works. It was at Theodore Powys&#x27;s house that novelist Sylvia Townsend Warner first met the poet Valentine Ackland. Warner&#x27;s diaries record that the two women lived together in Frome Vauchurch from 1930 until Valentine&#x27;s death in 1969; she died there on 1 May 1978.

Just north of the village are four prehistoric bowl barrows. The Five Marys, a group of round barrows, are on a ridge farther north with two more bowl barrows. These are all scheduled monuments.

The parish church is St. Nicholas. There is a restaurant-pub, The Sailor&#x27;s Return, and B. &amp; B. accommodation. The newest shop is in Winfrith Newburgh, a mile away. The village has 18 listed buildings, all at Grade II.

<text>Geysztor or Gieysztor is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several Szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
Name goes back to the year 1582 and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. There are two branches of the family. One is spelled Geysztor (in the south), the other Gieysztor (in the north). The schism occurred about two hundred years later (when the family started feuding).

==Blazon==
The Red field (warrior or martyr; military strength and magnanimity) means that the forefather was elevated to dukedom in battle (a blue background would have meant for administrative excellence).

Stars represent celestial goodness; noble person; excellence.

<doc id="1073175" wikidata="Q263779" url="?curid=1073175" title="Maria al-Qibtiyya">
<text>&#x27; (), better known as &#x27; or  (), or Maria the [[Copts|Copt]], died 637, was an Egyptian woman who, along with her sister Sirin bint Shamun, was given as a slave to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 628 by Al-Muqawqis, a Christian governor of Alexandria, during the territory&#x27;s Sasanian occupation. It is a subject of speculation if she married Muhammad or continued to be a concubine. She spent the rest of her life in Medina, and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died in his infancy, aged 2, and she died almost five years later.

Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (, &quot;Alábastrōn pólis&quot;, ), a village located near Antinoöpolis.

==Biography==

In the Islamic year 6 AH (627 – 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari&#x27;s &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot;. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as &quot;al-Muqawqis&quot;. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam.

Tabari recounts the story of Maria&#x27;s arrival from Egypt:

The death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.

=== Status as a wife or concubine ===
Muhammad&#x27;s earliest biographers, Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa&#x27;d, and al-Tabari mentioned Mariyah as Muhammad&#x27;s wife in their sirah.

Ibn Kathir states in his sirah that Muhammad married Mariyah:

Muhammad married Mariyah al-Qibtiyya, as narrated in Sahih Al-Mustadrak ala al-Sahihayn:

Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma&#x27;ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.
Some Islamic scholars point to a different Asbāb al-nuzūl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammad&#x27;s wife Aisha:

Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad&#x27;s wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.

There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:

The &#x27;female-slave&#x27; referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as &quot;sahih&quot; by Ibn Kathir, which names her &quot;Umm Ibrahim&quot; (the mother of Ibrahim).

In a report from Ibn &#x27;Abbas and &#x27;Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:

Some Islamic scholars point to a different Asbāb al-nuzūl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammad&#x27;s wife Aisha:

Al-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad&#x27;s wives and his slave, perhaps using &quot;wife&quot; in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.

One hadith attributed to Mus&#x27;ab b. &#x27;Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus&#x27;ab&#x27;s nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.

<text>The Coopworth is a modern New Zealand breed of sheep. It was developed by researchers at Lincoln College in the Canterbury region of the South Island between about 1956 and 1968, the result of cross-breeding of New Zealand Romney ewes and Border Leicester rams. It has become the second-most numerous sheep breed in New Zealand, and has been exported to Australia, some European countries, and the United States.

== History ==

The Coopworth was developed between about 1956 and 1968 at Lincoln College (now Lincoln University), near Christchurch in the Canterbury region of the South Island by researchers under Ian Coop. The aim of the project was to increase the prolificacy or lambing percentage of ewes. To this end, New Zealand Romney ewes were put to Border Leicester rams; the Border Leicester was at that time the most prolific breed in New Zealand. Successive generations were then selectively bred based on strict performance recording for factors including fertility, maternal qualities, rate of growth and fleece weight. Results came fast – by about the fourth generation the cross-bred line was thought better than a direct Romney–Border Leicester cross, despite the benefit of heterosis in the latter. A breed association, the Coopworth Sheep Society of New Zealand, was formed in 1968 after a meeting of breeders.

The Coopworth soon became widespread. By 1984 it was the second-most numerous breed in New Zealand after the Romney, constituting almost 20% of the national flock and almost half the number of Romneys; in 2000 it represented about 10% of the whole population, while the Romney made up almost 60%.

It was soon exported to Australia (from 1975), to the United States (from 1970) and to some European countries.

== Characteristics ==

The Coopworth looks much like the Romney, but is rather larger. It is of medium size: mature ewes weigh about , rams some It is polled, white-faced and white-woolled; the face and legs are free of wool. It is a lowland sheep, more suited to improved lowland pasture than to hill country.

The Woodlands Coopworth is a strain within the Coopworth breed, characterised by an X-linked gene which increases ovulation by about 40%, and so contributes to greater fecundity.

== Use ==

The Coopworth is reared for both meat and wool. Fleeces weigh about ; staple length is in the range with a fibre diameter of about (Bradford count 48/46s). The wool is used for clothing, for hand-spinning, and in carpet blends.

<text>Polish heraldry is the study of the coats of arms that have historically been used in Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It treats of specifically Polish heraldic traits and of the Polish heraldic system, contrasted with heraldic systems used elsewhere, notably in Western Europe. Due to the distinctive ways in which feudal societies evolved, Poland&#x27;s heraldic traditions differ substantially from those of the modern-day German lands and France.

Polish heraldry is an integral part of the history of the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility).

==History==
Unlike Western Europe, in Poland, the Polish nobles did not emerge exclusively from the feudal class of knights but stemmed in great part from earlier Slavic local rulers and free warriors and mercenaries. Rulers often hired these free warriors and mercenaries to form military units () and eventually, in the 11th century during the time of Casimir I the Restorer with the development of feudalism, armies paid by the Prince were replaced by knights that were paid in land. Much written evidence from the Middle Ages demonstrates how some elements of the Polish nobility did emerge from former Slavic rulers that were included in the ranks of the knightly class under the terms of the chivalric law () and .

Because Polish clans () have different origins, only part of the &quot;szlachta&quot; can be traced all the way back to the traditional old clan system based on kinship. The clans that could show kinship belonged to a House (), such as the House of Odrowąż. Later, when different Houses created different surnames for each property, the House turned into the Clan Odrowąż. Other szlachta were not related and their unions were mostly voluntary and based on fellowship and brotherhood rather than kinship, still being full members of the Clan, creating Clan politics like in Clan Ostoja or Clan Abdank, but forming a heraldic clan. Near the end of the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, due to adoptions and other circumstances, all Clans in Poland turned into Heraldic Clans.

In the year 1244, Bolesław, Duke of Masovia, identified members of the knights&#x27; clan as members of a &quot;genealogia:&quot;
I received my good servitors [Raciborz and Albert] from the land of [Great] Poland, and from the clan [&quot;genealogia&quot;] called Jelito, with my well-disposed knowledge [i.e., consent and encouragement] and the cry [&quot;vocitatio&quot;], [that is], the &quot;godło,&quot; [by the name of] &quot;Nagody,&quot; and I established them in the said land of mine, Masovia, [on the military tenure described elsewhere in the charter].
The documentation regarding Raciborz and Albert&#x27;s tenure is the earliest surviving of the use of the clan name and cry defining the honorable status of Polish knights. The names of knightly &quot;genealogiae&quot; only came to be associated with heraldic devices later in the Middle Ages and in the early modern period. The Polish clan name and cry ritualized the &quot;ius militare,&quot; i.e., the power to command an army; and they had been used sometime before 1244 to define knightly status.

According to Polish historian Tadeusz Manteuffel, a Polish clan (&quot;ród&quot;) consisted of people related by blood and descending from a common ancestor, giving the ród/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity (see &quot;gens&quot;). The &quot;starosta&quot; (or starszyna) had judicial and military power over the ród/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called &quot;gród&quot; were built where a unifying religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The &quot;opole&quot; was the territory occupied by a single tribe. Such clans often used signs (proto-coat of arms) that later, during 13th century become coat of arms of the House or the Clan. The origin of those proto-CoAs is controversial. Some, like Sulimirski, claim Sarmatian origin and some like historian Franciszek Piekosiński claim that those signs are Runes of dynastic tribal rulers.

Heraldic symbols began to be used in Poland in the 13th century. The generic Polish term for a coat of arms, &quot;herb&quot;, was used for the first time in the year 1415 at the Royal Office with text &quot;et quatuor herbis&quot;, originating as a borrowing of the Czech &quot;erb&quot;, which in turn came from the German &quot;Erbe&quot; – &quot;heritage&quot;.

During the Union of Horodło (1413), 47 Prince and Boyar families of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were adopted into 47 Polish noble clans and began to use Polish coats of arms.

==Medieval coats of arms==

Since there was no heraldic authority in Poland or in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, many old Polish coats of arms were changed over time by different publications, losing their original appearance. The was registered on 20 January 2010. Although many medieval Polish coats of arms were presented in Western European rolls of arms, there were no publications that presented original coats of arms in Poland until the 20th century, when began recovering old Polish coats of arms. His work was continued by Professor , who finally published an armorial of original Polish coats of arms.

The ancient Pałuki family coat of arms was visually close to the Topór coat of arms, and in time a similar coat was assumed by Clan Topór. As the Ostoja coat of arms evolved, the dragon was replaced by feathers and the cross by the sword, followed by other changes between ancient and modern versions.

Many Polish coats of arms feature so-called variations, which are particular to Polish heraldry. In many cases, variations are simple errors, sometimes the family wished to make a distinction within the clan and in other cases coats have been called variations of a particular family&#x27;s coat just because they look similar, which all together create a unique heraldic clan organisation in Poland. This is presented in the second part of the gallery, which shows many different variations of the Ostoja coat of arms.


None of the variations above have anything in common with Ostoja, they just look similar.

Starting with proto-arms and families like Odrowąż being the House of Odrowąż, Polish family names were appended in many cases with -&quot;cki&quot; or -&quot;ski&quot; in reference to the name of their properties; for example, if a person named Chełmski acquired the town of Poniec, he would change his surname to Poniecki. Furthermore, a Jerzykowski (de Jerzykowo) that owned the property of Baranowo changed his surname to Baranowski (de Baranowo) and a Baranowski that owned the property of Chrzastowo change the surname to Chrzastowski (de Chrzastowo). A family became a clan or &quot;heraldic family&quot; using the same coat of arms. Later, when clans adopted several families, they formed heraldic clans, families using the same arms, in many cases defending clan politics but not necessarily blood related to each other.

==Peculiarities==
Although the Polish heraldic system evolved under the influence of German heraldry, there are many notable differences.

The most striking peculiarity of the system is that a coat of arms does not belong to a single family. A number of unrelated families (sometimes hundreds of them), usually with a number of different family names, may use the same, undifferenced coat of arms, and each coat of arms has its own name. The total number of coats of arms in this system was relatively low – ca. 160 (Piekosiński) in the late Middle Ages. The same can be also seen in Western Europe when families of different surnames but sharing clan origin would use similar coats-of-arms, the fleur-de-lis of the many Capetian families being perhaps the best-known example.

One side-effect of this unique arrangement was that it became customary to refer to noblemen by both their family name and their coat of arms name (or &quot;clan name&quot;). For example, Jan Zamoyski &quot;herbu&quot; Jelita means &quot;Jan Zamoyski of the Jelita coat of arms&quot; (though it is often translated as &quot;of the clan Jelita&quot; or &quot;herbu&quot; is Latinized &quot;de armis&quot;). From the 15th to 17th centuries, the formula seems to have been to copy the ancient Roman naming convention: &quot;praenomen&quot; (or given name), &quot;nomen gentile&quot; (or Gens/Clan name) and &quot;cognomen&quot; (surname), following the Renaissance fashion. So we have &quot;Jan Jelita Zamoyski&quot;, forming a double-barrelled name (&quot;nazwisko złożone&quot;, literally &quot;compound name&quot;). Later, the double-barrelled name began to be joined with a hyphen: &quot;Jan Jelita-Zamoyski&quot;. (See Polish names).

The Polish émigrés of the 19th century sometimes used adaptations of their names according to the Western European (mainly French) style, becoming e.g. Balthasar Klossowski de Rola (Balthus), Jean de Bloch (Jan Gotlib Bloch), or Tamara de Lempicka. Some would also keep the Latin forms of their surnames, as Latin was the official language of the Kingdom of Poland, hence the popularity of Late-Medieval or Early-Modern forms such as &quot;de Zamosc Zamoyski&quot;.

A single coat of arms could appear in slightly different versions, typically in different colours, depending on the custom of the family using it. Such variations (&quot;odmiany&quot;) are still considered as representing the same coat of arms.

One of the most visually striking characteristics of Polish heraldry is the abundance of gules (red) fields. Among the oldest coats of arms in Poland, nearly half use a red background, with blue (azure) coming in a distant second. Nowhere else in Europe is there seen such a strong bias towards a particular colour scheme. It follows, however, the well-known heraldic custom of all Europe, of the vassals following the colour-scheme of their overlord, which found practical use on the battlefield.

Other typical features used in Polish heraldry include horseshoes, arrows, Maltese crosses, scythes, stars, and crescents. There are also many purely geometrical shapes for which a separate set of heraldic terms was invented. It has been suggested that originally all Polish coats of arms were based on such abstract geometrical shapes, but most were gradually &quot;rationalized&quot; into horseshoes, arrows and so on. If this hypothesis is correct, it suggests in turn that Polish heraldry, also unlike western European heraldry, may be at least partly derived from the &quot;Tamgas&quot;, marks used by Eurasian nomads such as the Sarmatians, Avars and Mongols, to mark property. Evidence of the origins of the system was considered scanty, and the hypothesis has been criticized as being part of &quot;Sarmatism&quot; (the Polish tradition of romanticizing their supposed Sarmatian ancestry). However, recent DNA projects that concern Polish Nobility proved that at least part of Polish Nobility is of Sarmatian origin.

A Polish coat of arms consists of shield, crest, helm, and crown. Mantling became fashionable during the 18th and 19th centuries. Supporters, mottos, and compartments normally do not appear, although certain individuals used them, especially in the final stages of the system&#x27;s development, partly in response to French and German influence. Preserved medieval evidence shows Polish coats-of-arms with mantling and supporters.

=== Shield ===

Polish coats of arms are divided in the same way as their western counterparts. However, Polish coats of arms is applied on clans rather than to separate families and new families where adopted to the Clan, using same CoA. Thus Polish escutcheons are rarely parted, there are however a lot of preserved quartered coats-of-arms. These would most often show the arms of the four grandparents of the bearer. Or also the paternal-paternal great-grandmother in the 5th field if the male-line coat-of-arms goes in the heart field.

The tradition of differentiating between the coat of arms proper and a lozenge granted to women did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, usually, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father or mother or even both (or a member of a clan who had adopted them). But also men or women could permanently adopt the arms of their wives or husbands and transmit them to their children, even after remarriages. The brisure was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat(s) of arms of their parent(s) and transmit them to their children. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had adopted a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the trend of the nobly titled marrying &quot;commoners&quot; and passing on their title to their spouse and children, forbidden in the Middle Ages. An illegitimate child could adopt her/his noble mother&#x27;s surname and title with the consent of the mother&#x27;s father but was often adopted and raised by the natural father&#x27;s family, thereby acquiring the father&#x27;s surname and title.

Heart-shaped shields were mostly used in representations of the coats of arms of royalty. Following the union between Poland and Lithuania, and the creation of the elective monarchy, it became customary to place the coats of Poland and Lithuania diagonally, with the coat of arms of the specific monarch placed centrally on top. Research continues to find out what a &quot;heart-shaped&quot; shield is. Most likely, the coat of Poland was placed on the left-right diagonal (I &amp; IV) and Lithuania on the right-left diagonal (II &amp; III) as evidenced in the shield at the top of this page. The specific monarch crest then being placed in the &quot;heart&quot; position.

===Tinctures===

In addition to these seven basic tinctures, which were standard in western Europe, many more tinctures were used in Poland and (after the union with Poland) Lithuania.

Traditionally coats of arms were published in various listings of szlachta and in armorials, known in Polish as &quot;herbarz&quot;. Such publications, akin to &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; or &quot;Gelre Armorial&quot; and descended from the tradition of rolls of arms, appeared in Poland regularly from the 15th century onwards. The first such armorial was &quot;Insignia seu clenodia incliti Regni Poloniae&quot; by Jan Długosz. In recent years growing interest in family histories has led to publication of numerous newly compiled listings of coats of arms and families. Some of the most notable among such publications are:

<text>Hipocentaur (Polish for &quot;Hippocentaur&quot;) is a Lithuanian and Polish coat of arms. It was used by a number of &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) families under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
The earliest images of the coat of arms come from 1422, when seals of two brothers from the Holszanski family were attached to the documents of the Treaty of Melno.

==Blazon==
J-B. Rietstap, specifying that the field of the shield is red, blazons the arms as:

&quot;De gueules, à un centaure Sagittaire au naturel, la tête retournée vers senestre, la queue levée, recourbée et terminée en tête de serpent. Casque couronné. Cimier: trois plumes d&#x27;autruche d&#x27;argent.&quot;

He also blazons the arms of &quot;Hornostay&quot; (Lithuania), with a blue field, as
&quot;D&#x27;azur au centaure sagittaire de carnation, ayant la queue terminée par un serpent qui fait jouer son dard, et acc. en pointe d&#x27;une rose d&#x27;argent (Hippocentaurus)&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="1073200" wikidata="Q2215951" url="?curid=1073200" title="Charlton Marshall">
<text>Charlton Marshall is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It lies within the North Dorset administrative district, on the A350 road south of the market town of Blandford Forum. It is sited on a river terrace above the floodplain of the River Stour, with most of the land in the parish stretching south-west over chalk hills. In the 2011 census the number of dwellings recorded within the parish was 513 and the population was 1,156.

Within the parish boundary is evidence of the sites of Anglo-Saxon burial mounds, and human habitation in the parish can be dated back at least a thousand years. Next to the river were three earlier settlements, which influenced the elongated layout of the current village. The parish church was rebuilt in 1713 and restored in 1895, although the tower dates from the 15th century. Charlton Marshall Halt railway station was once a halt on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.

Within the last half century Charlton Marshall has grown considerably, and there are now more than five times as many homes in the village as there were in the middle of the 19th century. A proposal to jointly bypass Charlton Marshall and neighbouring Spetisbury has never been realised.

== Governance ==
Charlton Marshall civil parish was in Riversdale electoral ward, which also includes Spetisbury civil parish to the south. The total ward population in the 2011 census was 1,711.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Charlton Marshall is part of the Winterborne North ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

<text>Kryszpin is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
The exact story behind this coat of arms is unknown. Both its blazoning and the features used are probably of foreign origin and were naturalised in Polish heraldry sometime in the 16th century, probably of German origin. It is somehow related to the Nieczuja coat of arms.

==Blazon==
Parted per pale, or and azure, in dexter two deer heads couped argent, in sinister lion passant argent. Both divided by a tree rump proper.

<doc id="1073202" wikidata="Q2164531" url="?curid=1073202" title="Rounder Records">
<text>Rounder Records is an independent record label founded in 1970 in Somerville, Massachusetts, by Marian Leighton Levy, Ken Irwin, and Bill Nowlin. Focused on American roots music, Rounder&#x27;s catalogue of more than 3000 titles includes records by Alison Krauss and Union Station, George Thorogood, Tony Rice, and Béla Fleck, in addition to re-releases of seminal albums by artists such as the Carter Family, Jelly Roll Morton, Lead Belly, and Woody Guthrie. &quot;Championing and preserving the music of artists whose music falls outside of the mainstream,&quot; Rounder releases have won 54 Grammy Awards representing diverse genres, from bluegrass, folk, reggae, and gospel to pop, rock, Americana, polka and world music. Acquired by Concord in 2010, Rounder is based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2016, The Rounder Founders (Levy, Irwin and Nowlin) were inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
Rounder was founded by Ken Irwin, Bill Nowlin, and Marian Leighton Levy. Nowlin and Irwin first met in 1962 as incoming freshman at Tufts University in the Boston suburb of Medford, Massachusetts. Exposure to The Greenbriar Boys, the Charles River Valley Boys, the &quot;Hillbilly at Harvard&quot; radio show, and fiddling conventions, as well as the musicians who performed at Club 47, one of the first venues in the Northeast to book African-American blues artists from the American south, fueled their interest in bluegrass, old-time, and other roots music. They were unable to find records by many of the artists they saw live: the records &quot;just didn&#x27;t exist.&quot;

Nowlin and Irwin met Levy, then a student at Clark University, in 1967. An &quot;unrepentant folkie,&quot; like Nowlin and Irwin, she moved to Boston to attend graduate school at Northeastern University. The three shared an apartment as well as a desire to bring roots music to a wider audience, and began to explore the idea of starting a record company. &quot;We were all involved in radical politics, and the anti-war movement, and a lot of our inspiration for starting Rounder had to do with minority culture and wanting to represent music that we really liked, but that was not in the mainstream,&quot; Levy said in a 2015 interview.

===1970s: George Pegram, Norman Blake, Rounder 0044, George Thorogood===
Financed with Irwin&#x27;s savings of $1500, Rounder was founded in 1970 in the Somerville apartment, a living/working/political collective. The name Rounder was chosen for several reasons: the shape of a vinyl record, the nickname for a hobo, and the name of the folk band The Holy Modal Rounders. Levy, Irwin and Nowlin also self-identified as &quot;Rounders&quot;, the name reflecting the &quot;outlaw self-image of three romantics who positioned themselves in opposition to capitalism, the programmatic rigidity of the old Left, and the more doctrinaire cultural rules of the folk revival itself.&quot; The lawyer who drew up Rounder&#x27;s papers of incorporation did so in exchange for two Rounder albums. 
Irwin and Nowlin were introduced to fiddle music through a Folkways recording of the 34th Old Time Fiddlers Convention, and in late 1969 (sources differ), for $125 , they bought the rights to a tape by a 76-year-old banjo player, George Pegram, who had been a star of the Fiddlers Convention. It became Rounder&#x27;s first release, Rounder 0001. Rounder 0002 was by the Spark Gap Wonder Boys; a local band, the album was recorded at the Harvard and MIT radio stations for &quot;the cost of the tape.&quot; 500 copies of each record were pressed. Both were released on October 20, 1970. To boost the label&#x27;s credibility—and get local record stores to stock their releases—Irwin, Nowlin, and Levy started distributing other small folk labels, and began selling albums at music festivals.

In 1971, the label released its first bluegrass album, &quot;One Morning in May,&quot; by Joe Val and the New England Bluegrass Boys. Over the next several years, they released bluegrass albums by old-time artists (Snuffy Jenkins and Pappy Sherrill, Highwoods Stringband, and The Blue Sky Boys), traditional bluegrass artists (Don Stover, Ted Lundy, Del McCoury, The Bailey Brothers, Buzz Busby), and progressive bluegrass artists, most notably by Country Cooking and Tony Trischka.

Believing that &quot;music doesn&#x27;t discriminate,&quot; Nowlin, Irwin and Leighton-Levy sought out female artists, then a rarity in the bluegrass world, and in the early 1970s released albums by Hazel Dickens and Alice Gerrard, who recorded as Hazel &amp; Alice, and Ola Belle Reed. By 1974, Rounder had put out 22 records, including the label&#x27;s breakthrough album, Norman Blake&#x27;s &quot;Home in Sulphur Springs&quot;. Realizing that Rounder was no longer a part-time pursuit, Irwin resigned from his job—he was a professor at the University of Lowell—and Nowlin and Levy left graduate school to run Rounder full-time. 
In 1975, Rounder released the self-titled debut album by J. D. Crowe and The New South. One of the &quot;most pioneering and influential records in the history of bluegrass,&quot;, it was commonly referred to by its stock number, Rounder 0044. The program notes from the 2016 Bluegrass Hall of Fame Induction ceremony stated that the record &quot;did much to chart the course of bluegrass for the balance of the 1970s and beyond.&quot;

In addition to new music, Rounder re-released 78 rpm discs from the 1920s and 1930s. In the mid-1970s, with a catalog of about 200 LPs by acoustic artists, the label expanded its Bluegrass focus to include folk, blues and other styles of music, notably signing NRBQ, Arlen Roth and George Thorogood and the Destroyers. In May 1977, Rounder released NRBQ&#x27;s &quot;All Hopped Up.&quot; Later that year, George Thorogood and the Destroyer&#x27;s eponymous debut was released; although it was rooted in blues, it was more of a rock album than any of the label&#x27;s previous releases. Within a year, the record sold more than 75,000 copies, a substantial achievement at the time for an independently distributed record. Rounder released the Destroyer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Move it on Over&quot;, in 1978. The title track, a Hank Williams cover, was released as a single and received heavy FM airplay. The album entered the American Top 40 and went gold, as did the band&#x27;s debut. Irwin described Thorogood&#x27;s success as a &quot;watershed&quot; moment for Rounder, stating that while it did not change the founder&#x27;s interest or mission, it made clear that the label needed to expand both its staff and its distribution. Rounder recorded Thorogood&#x27;s fourth record, &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot;, and released it through a joint venture with EMI. At the close of the decade, Rounder moved from their Somerville office to a larger office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 1979, Rounder&#x27;s employees decided to unionize, and Nowlin, Levy, and Irwin were strongly opposed. The workers voted to join Local 925 of the Service Employees International Union. As a result of their opposition to the union, relations between the employees and the founders were strained for several years.

=== 1980s: Heartbeat, Philo, Alison Krauss ===
Although they were approached by less traditional roots artists following Thorogood&#x27;s success, the founders signed artists that reflected the label&#x27;s original mission. Among others, they signed Johnny Copeland and Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown. Scott Billington, a musician and Rounder staff member, was recruited to produce Brown&#x27;s debut for Rounder with Jim Bateman, and together they pushed Brown to record classic blues songs. The resulting album, &quot;Alright Again!&quot;, won the 1982 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album. It was Rounder&#x27;s first Grammy.

In the early 80s, Rounder once again broadened its focus, establishing a reggae imprint, Heartbeat and adding Klezmer, Cajun, Zydeco and Tex-Mex Conjunto musicians to its roster. Throughout the decade, the label released records by esoteric artists who were unlikely to garner mainstream recognition, including Ted Hawkins, Jonathan Richman, and Sleepy LaBeef.

In 1984, Rounder acquired the traditional and folk music label Philo Records. Among others, the acquisition brought Utah Phillips, Dave Van Ronk, Christine Lavin, and singer-songwriter Nanci Griffith to the label. Griffith&#x27;s Rounder debut, &quot;Once in a Very Blue Moon&quot;, marked the &quot;emergence of a major talent.&quot; Critically acclaimed, the album was the foundation for Griffith&#x27;s 1993 success with the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; (released by Elektra).

Largely responsible for Rounder&#x27;s A&amp;R, Irwin listened to every demo tape that the label was sent. He first heard Alison Krauss in 1984 on a demo of the band Classical Grass, later known as Union Station, and Krauss—who mainly played fiddle and contributed vocal harmonies—sang lead on a gospel song. Irwin, taken with her voice, was interested in Krauss as a solo artist, and signed her to Rounder at 14. Once on the roster, Irwin brought Krauss (and her parents) to Nashville to find a producer for her Rounder debut. The album, &quot;Too Late to Cry&quot;, was released in 1987, when Krauss was 16. It was followed by the Union Station album &quot;Two Highways&quot; in 1989.

===1990s: Zoe Records, Mercury Records, Music for Little People, Liquid Audio===
Rounder released &quot;I&#x27;ve Got That Old Feeling&quot;, Krauss&#x27; second solo album, in 1990. It was her first album to hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and earned Krauss a 1991 Grammy Award—her first—in the Best Bluegrass album category. Over the course of the decade, Krauss would release a second solo album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Forget About It&quot;, and two albums with Union Station, &quot;Everytime You Say Goodbye&quot; (1992) and &quot;So Long So Wrong&quot;. (1997). &quot;Forget About It&quot; and &quot;So Long So Wrong&quot; were certified gold. Krauss won four Grammys as a solo artist and Union Station won five during the 1990s.

In 1991, producer Ron Levy partnered with Rounder to create and distribute the Bullseye Blues label, releasing music from Lowell Fulson, Smokin&#x27; Joe Kubek and Charles Brown. In the winter of that year, the company merged with Rykodisc distribution&#x27;s East Side Digital to form REP Co. along with Precision Sound. Rykodisc later restructured to form Distribution North America, which would handle many of Rounder&#x27;s albums.

Rounder acquired the children&#x27;s label, Music for Little People, in 1994. Renamed Rounder Kids, it functioned as a separate corporation within the Rounder Records Group. Artists including Raffi released records through Rounder Kids, which distributed labels 250 labels and 2200 titles.

Rounder bought the Chicago-based Flying Fish Records in fall of 1995. The label, founded in 1974 by Rounder associate Bruce Kaplan, had a catalog of over 500 records by artists including Sweet Honey in the Rock, Pete Seeger, and Doc Watson at the time of its acquisition. That same year, Krauss released the career retrospective, &quot;Now That I&#x27;ve Found You&quot;. The album charted at #2 on the country charts, and hit the top fifteen on the pop charts. It sold two million copies and received two Grammy Awards.

In 1997, the founders appointed Rounder&#x27;s first president and CEO, John Virant, who had been the label&#x27;s general counsel since 1992. Among other initiatives, Virant conceived of and oversaw the creation of a pop music imprint, Zoë, named for his daughter. Artists including Blake Babies, Juliana Hatfield, Kay Hanley and Sarah Harmer released records on the imprint.

A distribution agreement with Polygram&#x27;s Mercury Records was signed in 1998. Expected to increase the sales of new releases of artists such as Juliana Hatfield, the PolyGram Group Distribution affiliate handled more than a third of Rounder&#x27;s titles. Less prominent titles were sold through distributors DNA and Bayside.

In April 1999, the company signed an agreement with Liquid Audio, Inc. for digital distribution of its music over the Internet. By then, Mercury&#x27;s parent company PolyGram had been acquired by Universal. Universal Music and Video Distribution unit sold Rounder&#x27;s bigger titles.

===2000s: &quot;Raising Sand&quot;, Rounder Books, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Steve Martin===
While polka was a mainstay of Rounder&#x27;s catalog, in 2001 the company moved the musical style to the mainstream with the release of Jimmy Sturr&#x27;s &quot;Gone Polka&quot; album. &quot;Unabashed polka fan,&quot; Willie Nelson, whose first bands played polka, often recorded on Sturr&#x27;s albums, and four songs on &quot;Gone Polka&quot; featured Nelson&#x27;s vocals, illustrating &quot;the happy cross-cultural union between the Lone Star State and Eastern Europe.&quot;

In 2002, Rounder signed a deal with Provident Music Distribution to sell Rounder products to Christian retailers, and began marketing the recordings of jazz saxophonist Branford Marsalis&#x27;s Marsalis Music label.

Rounder Books was created in Spring 2004. The division&#x27;s first releases were Nowlin&#x27;s baseball biography &quot;Mr. Red Sox: The Johnny Pesky Story&quot;, and a book of collected fan essays, edited by Nowlin and Cecelia Tan. Nowlin, along with other co-writers, released another three Red Sox-themed books over the next six years. Other titles from Rounder Books included a children&#x27;s book by Raffi, &quot;Everybody Grows&quot;, and the company&#x27;s bestseller, Rush drummer/lyricist Neil Peart&#x27;s &quot;Roadshow: Landscape with Drums—A Concert Tour by Motorcycle&quot;.

In 1986, although pursued by Rounder, Mary Chapin Carpenter chose instead to sign with Columbia Records. Twenty years later, in 2006, she signed with Rounder. Moving beyond the country music she was associated with, on Rounder she released what many fans and critics regarded as the best albums of her career.

Echoing the early achievements of Hazel Dickens and Alison Krauss, in the male-dominated field of bluegrass music, in 2007 Rounder released &quot;Crowd Favorites,&quot; a compilation of six albums by Claire Lynch. The album earned multiple International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) awards and Lynch was inducted into the Alabama Bluegrass Hall of Fame. In 2005, Lynn Morris, Alecia Nugent and Rhonda Vincent were honored by the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America.

The Robert Plant/Alison Krauss album, &quot;Raising Sand,&quot; in 2007, was one of Rounder&#x27;s biggest hits both commercially and critically. It won five Grammys, including Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album, Record of the Year (for &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot;), Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for &quot;Rich Woman,&quot; and Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for &quot;Killing the Blues&quot;. Krauss was the sixth female artist to win five Grammys in a single night. &quot;Raising Sand&quot; was certified platinum in March 2008.

In 2009, Rounder reissued a series of 1920s and 1930s Carter Family recordings. The same year, the label launched what would become a 100-disc reissue series compiled by musicologist Alan Lomax whose archival project began in 1938 with the taping of Jelly Roll Morton, and ultimately included Lead Belly, Muddy Waters, Woody Guthrie, and many others. Steve Martin also released the first of his Rounder albums, &quot;The Crow: New Songs for the Five-String Banjo&quot; in 2009.

Releasing about 100 albums per year by the end of the decade, Rounder&#x27;s catalog had grown to include Del McCoury, David Grisman, the Whitstein Brothers, Madeleine Peyroux, and James King, as well as supergroups Dreadful Snakes (Jerry Douglas, Pat Enright, Bela Fleck, Mark Hembree, Blaine Sprouse, and Roland White) and Longview (Dudley Connell, James King, Don Rigsby, Joe Mullins, Glen Duncan, and Marshall Wilborn), and the compilation &quot;Oh Sister&quot;. Artists including Robert Plant, Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, Ann Wilson, Fleck, Minnie Driver, Rush, Cowboy Junkies, Griffith, Laura Nyro, Fairport Convention, Linda Thompson, Boz Scaggs, Nelson, Skaggs, and Joe Diffie among others, recorded for Rounder during the 2000s.

===2010s: Concord, 40th anniversary, John Strohm===
In April 2010, Los Angeles, California–based Concord Music Group acquired Rounder Records, adding the latter&#x27;s 3,000 titles to its own 10,000. Irwin, Nowlin and Leighton-Levy remained in creative and advisory roles. In an interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Leighton-Levy said: &quot;We felt this was better than simply trying to soldier on alone. It&#x27;s not an exit strategy. Concord acquired Rounder wanting it to continue what it is doing.&quot;

To celebrate its 40th anniversary, Rounder produced a concert at the Grand Ole Opry. Broadcast on PBS in March 2010, &quot;The Rounder Records 40th Anniversary Concert&quot; was released on DVD to benefit NARAS&#x27;s Grammy in the Schools Program. Performers included Krauss, Carpenter, Martin, Thomas, Fleck, and Peyroux.

In 2014, Rounder moved from Cambridge to Nashville, Concord&#x27;s base of operations.

In April 2015, Concord merged its new acquisition, the North Carolina–based label, Sugar Hill, with the Rounder Label Group. Founded in the late 1970s, the Sugar Hill catalog included records by Ricky Skaggs, Lee Ann Womack, Sarah Jarosz, Liz Longley, Corey Smith, Kasey Chambers, Sam Bush, moe., and Bryan Sutton and Black Prairie.
John Strohm, a musician and entertainment lawyer, became Rounder&#x27;s president in 2017, as Virant moved to a senior creative role. An attorney at the Nashville law firm Loeb &amp; Loeb at the time, Strohm had been instrumental in developing the careers of Alabama Shakes, Sturgill Simpson, The Civil Wars, Dawes, and Bon Iver, among others. A guitarist, drummer, and songwriter, Strohm spent half of his career playing in critically acclaimed alternative bands including the Blake Babies, Antenna, and the Lemonheads. He also released two albums as a solo artist, &quot;Vestavia&quot; in (1999) and &quot;Everyday Life&quot; in 2007.

<text>The Drysdale is a New Zealand breed of sheep. It was developed from 1931 by Francis Dry, and derives from sheep of the New Zealand Romney breed in which a mutation caused the coat to be particularly hairy, and thus suitable for carpet-making. It is a specialised carpet wool breed, but also a useful meat breed.

== History ==
Francis Dry in 1931 noticed a genetic freak, a Romney ram with a high percentage of very coarse wool. Crossing two Romneys and Cheviots resulted in a sheep with a lot of coarse fleece which is about with a 40 microns fibre diameter and a staple of . The coarse wool gene causes both male and female Drysdales to be horned. The male&#x27;s horn resembles a Wiltshire ram&#x27;s horn whereas the ewe&#x27;s horns are very small - usually only in length. Live weight is 60–70 kg.

<text>Charminster is a village and civil parish in west Dorset, England, situated on the River Cerne and A352 road north of the county town Dorchester. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 2,940 and also contains the hamlet of Charlton Down.

The village name derives from the River Cerne and the small &#x27;minster&#x27; church of St Mary, resulting in &quot;Cerneminster&quot; (recorded in 1223), which eventually evolved into Charminster. The village, which includes Wolfeton House, was the place of origin of Richard Norman and family, one of the Planters of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in America, who arrived there in ca. 1626. Scientist Margaret Bastock died in the village in 1982, aged 62.

Charminster was in the Charminster and Cerne Valley electoral ward, which stretches from the northern outskirts of Dorchester through Cerne Abbas to Minterne Magna. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,768.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Charminster is part of the Charminster St Mary&#x27;s ward for elections to Dorset Council.

== Facilities == 
As a relatively large village Charminster has an abundance of amenities, with three pubs, a village hall and a community center with the former having seating capacity in the main hall of 100 seated 120 standing and a further 10 or so in other rooms, as well as a village green at Charminster house used for fetes and community celebrations, beyond this the village has a park and a numerous variety of shops and business with a previously mentioned church and a First school

<text>Przyjaciel (Polish for &quot;Friend&quot;) also known as &quot;de Pryjatel&quot; and &quot;Amicus&quot; is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) families under the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

The coat of arms has its source in the following historical event during the reign of the Polish King, Bolesław IV the Curly (Kędzierzawy) (1125-1173), Duke Henryk, Prince of Sandomierz, the king&#x27;s brother, was waging war against the still pagan Prussians, in 1164, and was killed in a battle. The knight Mirosław, who hailed from the east, as his name suggests, and who was in the service of the king and king&#x27;s brother, Henryk, broke through the enemy lines with his men, in order to retrieve Henryk&#x27;s body and valuable armor, but was killed himself in the process. For Mirosław&#x27;s steadfast loyalty, in the memory of his bravery, King Bolesław of Poland bestowed this coat of arms and lands to Mirosław&#x27;s descendants.

==Blazon==
A shield of blue color, with a heart in a vessel, pierced from top to bottom by an arrow, helmet with five ostrich feathers, and the blue and yellow fringe, signifying the ancient colors of knight Mirosław&#x27;s ancestral origins. 

==Notable bearers==

<text>The River Cerne is a river in Dorset, England, which rises in the Chalk hills of the Dorset Downs at Minterne Magna, between High Stoy and Dogbury Hill, flows down a valley through Cerne Abbas and Charminster, and flows into the River Frome in Dorchester. The Cerne Valley lies in the Dorset National Landscape.

Its name is derived from the Primitive Welsh *&quot;carn&quot;, &quot;pile of stones,&quot; thus meaning &quot;the stony stream.&quot; The pronunciation with soft &#x27;c&#x27;, instead of &quot;chern&quot; as would be expected (Old English *&quot;ċēarn&quot;), is suggested as being due to Anglo-Norman influence.

The Cerne has been described as &quot;a friendly river, for none of its delightful villages shun the stream&quot;. Another wrote, &quot;The change from the sheep-grazed open downland landscape of the river&#x27;s source to the intimate enclosed beauty of Minterne Gardens is quite magical&quot;.

The river&#x27;s valley is one of several roughly parallel valleys which drain the dip slope of the Dorset Downs. The Cerne Valley Way is a circular walk taking in the aforementioned hamlets and villages, as well as Nether Cerne, Godmanstone and Forston. This walk follows the course from near its source in the basin formed by the hill of High Stoy and Dogbury to its junction with the Frome in the water meadows at Charminster. Attractions along the route include Britain&#x27;s largest hill figure, the Cerne Abbas Giant, Minterne House and Gardens and Hilfield Hill nature reserve.

The Cerne is largely groundwater fed with some upstream catchment, running primarily over chalk and upper greensand. The bed armour is mainly of flint overlain by seasonal sandy silt, with a healthy ecosystem of flora and fauna. A 2008 report by the Wild Trout Trust stated that a fishery owned by the Gallia family is located near to Nether Cerne which had been recognised by a trust conservation award. The report concluded that &quot;the habitat of the River Cerne was excellent, providing good quality habitat for all life stages of brown trout&quot;.

In the past, the river has over spilled into Cerne Abbas, however no river-related flooding has occurred since a relief scheme, involving a system of gullies and culverts, and a reservoir capable of holding 44,000,000 litres of floodwater, was commissioned in 1986.

<text>Radwan () is a Polish knights&#x27; clan (&quot;ród&quot;) and a Polish coat of arms used by the noble families within the clan (&quot;szlachta&quot;).

==Blazon==
Gules: a Gonfanon or surmounted by a Maltese Cross of the last. Crest – on a crowned helmet – three ostrich feathers proper.

Arms: gules, a gonfannon ensigned of a cross in chief, and fringed in base, all or. Issuant of a helmet ducally crowned; for a crest, three ostrich plumes proper.

==History==

Radwan is among the most ancient coats of arms. Its origin traces to Polish and German nobility.

The most ancient seal dates from 1443 and the first record from 1409. This coat of arms was widespread mainly in the regions of Kraków, Płock, Sandomierz, Sieradz, and also in Podlasie, Rawa, Ruthenia, and Lithuania. It exists in eight variants.

Families of magnate status (możni/high nobility) bearing Radwan arms were the Babski&#x27;s, and the Magnuszewski&#x27;s and Uchański&#x27;s (See: Jakub Uchański), parts of the Mazovian feudal elite; however, many branches of the Radwans never transcended the status of middle and lesser nobility.

&quot;In Poland, the Radwanice were noted relatively early (1274) as the descendants of Radwan, a knight [more properly a &quot;rycerz&quot; (German &quot;ritter&quot;)] active a few decades earlier. ...&quot;

Kasper Niesiecki S.J. (1682–1744) in his &quot;Herbarz Polski&quot; (with increased legal proofs and additions by Jan Nepomucen Bobrowicz [1805–1881] in the Leipzig editions, 1839–1846) writes:

&quot;It [Radwan coat of arms] was awarded during the reign of King Bolesław Smialy (1058–1079) on the occasion of a battle with Ruthenia; a captain named Radwan had been sent out on a foray with part of the army. He happened upon the enemy camp in such close quarters that they could neither protect themselves from a skirmish with the Ruthenians, nor fight with them, inasmuch as their numbers were so much smaller. But they all agreed it was better to fall dead on the spot than to encourage the enemy by fleeing. So with all their heart they sprang toward the Ruthenians, whose knights were daunted by this attack; but when they saw the small numbers against them, the Ruthenians grew bold, and not only took away their banner, but dispersed them as well. Captain Radwan, wishing to encourage his men to fight once more, rushed to a nearby church, where he seized the church&#x27;s banner; he then gathered his men and courageously attacked the enemy. The Ruthenians took this to mean a new army with fresh troops had joined the battle, and began to retreat and flee. So Radwan&#x27;s banner carried the day, and for this he received that church&#x27;s banner for his shield, as well as other gifts.Paprocki, however, gives this as occurring during the rule of Bolesław Chrobry [992–1025] in 1021. He writes that Radwan was a royal chancellor, which information he is supposed to have taken from ancient royal grants. I conclude from this that either this clan sign is more ancient than the time of Bolesław Śmiały [1058–1079] and originated in the time of Bolesław Krzywousty [1102–1138], to whom some authors ascribe its conferment on that aforementioned Radwan; or else that before the time of Bolesław Śmiały [1058–1079] the Radwans used some other arms in their seal: for instance, that Radwan whom Paprocki gives as Bishop of Poznań in 1138. Długosz, in &#x27;Vitae Episcop. Posnan. [Lives of the Bishops of Poznań]&#x27; does not include him under Radwan arms, but Sreniawa; there I, too, will speak of him.&quot;

From Little Poland, the Śreniawa family/gens was insignificant and financially modest; however, King Kazimierz the Great (1310–1370) supported them in Little Poland.

Radwan, Bishop of Poznań, assisted with the establishment of the first Commandery of the Knights of Saint John in Poznań circa 1187 or possibly May 6, 1170. The donation was made by Mieszko III Stary (1121? – 1202), High Duke of all Poland.
==Ancient Origins and Reason for Many Surnames==

&quot;See: Szlachta: Origins of szlachta surnames&quot;.

The Polish state paralleled the Roman Empire in that full rights of citizenship were limited to the nobility/szlachta. The Polish nobility/szlachta in Poland, where Latin was written and spoken far and wide, used the Roman naming convention of the tria nomina (praenomen, nomen, and cognomen) to distinguish Polish citizens/nobles/szlachta from the peasantry and foreigners, hence why so many surnames are associated with the Radwan coat of arms.

Nomen (nomen gentile—name of the gens/ród or clan):

Radwan

Cognomen (name of the family sept within the gens):

For example—Braniecki, Dąbrowski, Czcikowski, Dostojewski, Górski, Nicki, Zebrzydowski, etc.
==Notable bearers==

Notable bearers of this coat of arms have included:
* Dąbrowski Manor in Michałowice
* Jarosław Dąbrowski
* Stefan Tytus Dąbrowski

* Fyodor Dostoyevsky (Polish spelling &quot;Dostojewski&quot;)

* Samuel Osiński
* Jakub Uchański
* House of Zebrzydowski
** Andrzej Zebrzydowski
** Mikołaj Zebrzydowski

==Friedrich Nietzsche as Polish Nobleman Controversy: His Ring Bearing Radwan Coat of Arms==

Friedrich Nietzsche wore a signet ring bearing the Radwan coat of arms. He often claimed his ancestors were Polish noblemen called either &quot;Niëtzky&quot; or &quot;Niëzky,&quot; which was equated to the surname of the Polish family &quot;Nicki&quot; bearing the Radwan coat of arms. Gotard Nietzsche, a member of the Nicki family, left Poland for Prussia. His descendants later settled in the Electorate of Saxony circa the year 1700. All Saints&#x27; Church, in Wittenberg, Saxony, is where Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses in 1517, according to Philip Melanchthon, which began the Protestant Reformation.

Nietzsche&#x27;s statements:
*&quot;meine Vorfahren waren polnische Edelleute, noch die Mutter meines Großvaters war Polin&quot;
*transl.: &quot;my ancestors were Polish noblemen, even my grandfather&#x27;s mother was Polish&quot;
– letter to Heinrich von Stein, c. beginning of December 1882
*&quot;Man hat mich gelehrt, die Herkunft meines Blutes und Namens auf polnische Edelleute zurückzuführen, welche Niëtzky hießen und etwa vor hundert Jahren ihre Heimat und ihren Adel aufgaben, unerträglichen religiösen Bedrückungen endlich weichend: es waren nämlich Protestanten.&quot;
*transl.: &quot;I was taught to ascribe the origin of my blood and name to Polish noblemen who were called Niëtzky and left their home and nobleness about a hundred years ago, finally yielding to unbearable suppression: they were Protestants.&quot;
– Nachlass, Sommer 1882 21 [2]

*&quot;Meine Vorfahren waren polnische Edelleute (Niëzky); es scheint, dass der Typus gut erhalten ist, trotz dreier deutschen &quot;Mütter&quot;.&quot;
*transl.: &quot;My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Niëzky); it seems that the type is well preserved in spite of three German &quot;mothers&quot;&quot;
– letter to Georg Brandes, April 10, 1888

*&quot;Und doch waren meine Vorfahren polnische Edelleute: ich habe von daher viel Rassen-Instinkte im Leibe, wer weiss? zuletzt gar noch das liberum veto. Denke ich daran, wie oft ich unterwegs als Pole angeredet werde und von Polen selbst, wie selten man mich für einen Deutschen nimmt, so könnte es scheinen, dass ich nur zu den angesprenkelten Deutschen gehörte.&quot;
*transl.: &quot;And yet my ancestors were Polish noblemen: it is owing to them that I have so much race instinct in my blood, who knows? perhaps even the liberum veto. When I think of how often I have been accosted as a Pole when traveling, even by Poles themselves, and how seldom I have been taken for a German, it seems to me as if I belonged to those who have but a sprinkling of German in them.
– &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, Warum ich so weise bin (Why I am so wise) No. 3 (earlier version)

In her 1895 biography &quot;Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s&quot;, his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche discussed this, quoted the second statement above and told a longer version of the story, giving her aunts as a source. Also she says that not their great-grandfather (as Friedrich had claimed), but their great-great-grandfather had travelled from Poland to Saxony; that this travel had lasted three years, and that their great-grandfather was born in this time. Also she recalled a lost document called &quot;La famille seigneuriale de Niëtzky&quot; in which it was stated that a member of the family had to flee from Poland in 1716. In her 1895 retelling of the story, Förster-Nietzsche did not state clearly whether she thought it to be true or a family myth. Many Nietzsche biographies until today have used Förster-Nietzsche&#x27;s book as a source.

In 1898, Hans von Müller did some research concerning the Nietzsches&#x27; origins. He found that Nietzsche&#x27;s great-grandfather was born on February 26, 1714 (8 o&#x27;clock in the morning) in the town of Bibra and was given the name Gotthelf Engelbert some days later. His father, Nietzsche&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, was named Christoph and had lived in Bibra since at least 1709. At that time, Müller could not find earlier evidence or the family birth name of Christoph Nietzsche&#x27;s wife, but nevertheless published his results. In a private talk with Elisabeth, he jokingly said that if the lost document had put the events in 1706, not 1716, there would at least have been a possibility of it being true.

He was quite surprised when Elisabeth published a harsh rejection of his essay and there stated that she &quot;just sees from an old notebook&quot; that the lost document had really put the events in 1706, not 1716. Although she accepted Müller&#x27;s evidence, she found it mysterious why the family name of Christoph Nietzsche&#x27;s wife was &quot;concealed&quot; in the old church books. [Elisabeth&#x27;s appearing and disappearing &quot;old notebooks&quot; have often been a very practical source for her statements].

In 1905, a Polish writer named Bernhard Scharlitt began to take interest in Nietzsche&#x27;s family history and wrote letters to Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche. In the book &quot;Herbarz polski&quot;, he found a small note about a family &quot;Nicki&quot; belonging to the Radwan coat of arms, and conjectured that some Gotard Nietzsche had migrated from Poland to Prussia c. 1632, and that his descendant Christoph Nietzsche in 1706 had merely changed Prussia with Saxony.

He wrote this to Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, who quickly dismissed all her earlier conjectures, even the religious suppression so important to her brother, and also found &quot;after thorough research&quot; that in fact her brother had always written (two-syllable) &quot;Nicki&quot; and never the three-syllable form &quot;Niëzky&quot;. [An obvious lie, see the above quotations by Nietzsche]. Scharlitt was full of joy and published his conjectures and Elisabeth&#x27;s letters in a Polish-patriotic article.

However, in her new 1912 biography &quot;Der junge Nietzsche&quot;, Elisabeth did not repeat her enthusiastic support for Scharlitt&#x27;s conjectures – perhaps they had become inopportune in rising German nationalism. She now wrote &quot;Nicki&quot; but nevertheless claimed that phonetically it would be &quot;Niëzky&quot; with three syllables; she changed (that is, forged) her brother&#x27;s 1882 fragment (second quotation on top) from &quot;etwa vor hundert Jahren&quot; (about hundred years ago) to &quot;vor mehr als hundert Jahren&quot; (more than hundred years ago), but in the end said that she does not know anything for sure because &quot;papers have been lost&quot;.

What Scharlitt and Förster-Nietzsche did not know was that Hans von Müller after her strong rejection had abstained from an open debate, but had quietly pursued his research in old churchbooks, and that he was successful. His results are:

*Nietzsche&#x27;s great-great-great-great-grandfather:
*Mattheß Nitzsche, lived in Burkau
*Nietzsche&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather:
*Christoph Nitzsche [I.], baptized May 15, 1662, Burkau; married to Anna Grüner, daughter of Hanß Grüner
*Nietzsche&#x27;s great-great-grandfather:
*Christoph Nitzsche [II.], first marriage in 1707 in Eckartsberga, living in Bibra at least since 1709, died January 5, 1739, lower tax official in Bibra
**First marriage with Johanna Christiana Büttner, daughter of Johann Dietrich Büttner from Eckartsberga
**Second marriage with Margaretha Elisabetha Schönermarckin [the one whose family name Elisabeth rumoured to be &quot;mysteriously concealed&quot;], daughter of Ludwig Heinrich Schönermarck in Sondershausen)
*Nietzsche&#x27;s great-grandfather:
*Gotthelf (or Gotthilf) Engelbert Nitzsche, born February 26, 1714, in Bibra, died September 21, 1804, in Bibra, succeeded his father as lower tax official); is from Christoph&#x27;s [II.] first marriage, not from the second one as Müller had conjectured in 1898.
**(First) marriage with Johanne Amalie Herold, born November 10, 1717, in Reinsdorf, died September 17, 1770, in Bibra, married July 19, 1740)

Their seventh child was
*Nietzsche&#x27;s grandfather:
*Friedrich August Ludwig Nitzsche (or Nietzsche), born January 29, 1756, in Bibra, died March 16, 1826, in Eilenburg, a Lutheran pastor
**First marriage with Johanne Friederike Richter, married July 6, 1784, in Bibra)
**Second marriage with Erdmuthe Dorothee Krause (born December 11, 1778, in Reichenbach, died Naumburg April 3, 1865 – Nietzsche knew her – married October 9, 1809, in Naumburg)

Nietzsche&#x27;s father Carl Ludwig Nietzsche, from the second marriage and also a Lutheran pastor, born October 10, 1813, is well known.

Hans von Müller wrote down the story of the legend and his results in a private manuscript between 1935 and 1937. The manuscript was published for the first time in 2002

Max Oehler also published an article about this in 1937/1938 (see article on Oehler). Whereas one should remain sceptical about Oehler, who was a devote Nazi, Hans von Müller&#x27;s text is clearly not written in favour of some Nazi ideology. But Oehler&#x27;s and Müller&#x27;s results are essentially identical, Oehler only gives three more ancestors: Mattheß&#x27; father Hans Nitzsche, born c. 1620–1630; Hans&#x27; father Elias Nitzsche, born c. 1600; and Elias&#x27; father, name unknown, born c. 1570, all in Burkau. Both Oehler and Müller did not exclude a Slavic origin of the family; however, Müller suggests Sorbian rather than Polish origin.

As a possible source for the family myth Nietzsche&#x27;s aunts believed in, Müller suggests Adam Nietzki (1714–1780), professor of medicine in Halle and of Polish (but not noble) origin, and Christoph Niczky, of Hungarian nobility, both of whom were not further related to the family Nietzsche.

Modern Nietzsche scholarship does not believe in the legend of noble Polish ancestry. For example, in the Colli-Montinari edition of Nietzsche&#x27;s letters, the commentary on the above quoted letter to Brandes shortly notes:
*&quot;diese von N gepflegte Legende entbehrt jeder Grundlage&quot;
*transl.: &quot;this legend maintained by N lacks any basis&quot;

<doc id="1073229" wikidata="Q2469040" url="?curid=1073229" title="Chedington">
<text>Chedington is a small village and civil parish in west Dorset, England, situated near the A356 road southeast of Crewkerne in Somerset. Dorset County Council estimate that in 2013 the population of the civil parish was 130. It is administered as part of Parrett and Axe Parish Council.

The village lies between the headwaters of the River Parrett, to the north, and the River Axe to the south. The Parrett flows in a northerly direction to the Bristol Channel at Bridgwater, whilst the Axe flows south to the English Channel at Axmouth, thus locating Chedington on the watershed of England&#x27;s South West Peninsula.

== Chedington early references ==
The name of the village is Old English for &#x27;the farm of a man named Cedd&#x27;, but it was not included in the Domesday Book, being first mentioned over 100 years later in 1194. It grew up around Chedington Court, although it was the neighbouring village of South Perrott that provided the tradesmen needed to service the estate. Chedington Court itself was completely rebuilt in 1840 by the then owner William Trevelyan Cox, as a flamboyant, Jacobean-style mansion where curvilinear gables feature prominently. Across the narrow thoroughfare, directly opposite to Chedington Court, is the 16th-century Manor Farm, much altered in the 17th c. The porch of this dressed-stone building, bears the inscription &quot;Thomas Warren 1634&quot;. Lower Farm, house 250 yards S.W. of the church, is of two storeys built in the 17th century.

As John Marius Wilson (1805–1885) put it in the Imperial Gazetteer of England &amp; Wales 1870-2, most of Chedington&#x27;s eminences command superb views, with Somerset&#x27;s Mendip Hills and Hamdon Hills, from which much of Chedington itself is hewn, to the North-East. &quot;Tucked into the deep hills of western Dorset, just off the major tourist routes across England, Chedington is so small that its handful of cottages doesn&#x27;t even appear on some large-scale maps. Here, far from crowds that haunt Blenheim Palace, Stonehenge, Stratford-upon-Avon, or Haworth, I find the England of my dreams--quiet, pastoral, and sometimes endearingly eccentric...&quot;
It is probable Charles II of England whilst on the run after the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, travelled through or close by Chedington and Winyard&#x27;s Gap on his circuitous six-week journey to escape. He had travelled from the battlefield through a series of safe-houses through Castle Cary to Trent Manor House and then to Charmouth staying at the Queen&#x27;s Arms. Continuing to Bridport on the coast before turning back to Broadwindsor staying at the George Inn. He returned to Trent Manor House again and continued to Mere, Wiltshire and eventually to Shoreham-by-Sea where he made his successful escape.

== Chedington Court ==
Chedington Court, which dates from 1285, was re-built in old Ham Stone in Jacobean-style in 1840, a Grade II listed property with grounds and parkland of 31 acres which included the source of the River Parrett, with that of the Axe being nearby.
By 1855 it was occupied by William Trevelyan Cox JP followed by Captain William Trevelyan Hody JP in 1889. Then Sir Henry Peto, son of the Victorian railway magnate Morton Peto bought Chedington Court and its estate in 1893. He became High Sheriff in 1897 and Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Dorset. Like so many families they lost two sons in the Great War, the heir to the estate, 30-year-old Captain Henry Peto of the 10th Royal Hussars, who fell in the first Battle of Ypres in November 1914 and later the 27-year-old Sapper Walter Samuel Peto of the Royal Engineers killed while on patrol in Salonika December 1917. Sir Henry and Lady Peto lived in the house until his death in 1938.

By the early 1980s it had become a hotel, a small seven-bedroom country house property run by Philip and Hilary Chapman. Hilary had developed a fine culinary reputation in the kitchen, whilst Philip concentrated on front of house. It had received good reviews, including The New York Times in June 1987, &quot;Ten acres of garden containing a lovely variety mature trees and shrubs. There were sweeping lawns, elegant terraces and a summer house nestling under an ancient yew hedge close to a landscaped pool. We saw a croquet lawn, a putting green, and even a helicopter landing ground. Inside, a marvellous oak staircase sets the tone for the whole house which featured heavy brass door handles, leaded lights in stone mullions and gleaming polished oak floors with beautiful oriental carpets. Most of the furniture was Victorian. One of the rooms had a fine thirties suite from the old RMS Queen Mary&quot; and The Washington Post in March 1991. The Chapmans&#x27; invested in a new 9-hole Chedington Court Golf Club at South Perrott designed by David Hemstock in August 1991 later extended to 18-holes, with club professional Simon Tucker.

However, the hotel was sold in 1997 to Canadian businessman Brendan Clouston for £1.2 million and returned to residential use, upsetting the local villagers in the process. Apparently, he let off some birthday fireworks for his wife, which reportedly frightened the neighbours and caused livestock to panic. On the market again in 2003 for £5.95 million, after Clouston left for Scotland. The golf course went into receivership in August 2010, finally closed in December and returned to farm pasture. On the market again in 2015, the Chedington Court Estate is now owned by the Guy family who have grown the Estate which now encompasses an events and wellness venue, a world-class equestrian centre and the Winyard&#x27;s Gap Inn pub. Dr Geoffrey Guy is founding partner of GW Pharmaceuticals.

== Chedington church (deconsecrated)==
The site of the Old Church and Churchyard lies about 50 yards North East of the Victorian Church and now forms part of the private gardens of Chedington Court. A transcript record of some of the memorials between 1713 and 1971 feature on Dorset Online Parish Council (OPC)

The Victorian Parish Church, built c.1840-1, by Richard Carver (architect) (1792-1862) of Taunton. Formerly dedicated to St James, was made redundant in 1980 and has since been converted into a private dwelling. A grade II listed building since 1966. Originally consisting solely of nave and chancel, the church has Ham stone ashlar walls, a chamfered plinth, a slate roof with stone gable-copings and a scallop-shell motif above the doorway. The bell-cote housed a single bell, said to date from 1610. Later, George Vialls was commissioned to add an organ chamber, a baptistery and the south porch. The building was in service for less than 140 years before it was deconsecrated, its bell dismounted and its internal fixtures removed. &lt;br&gt;
Chedington parish is now combined with that of South Perrott The 13th c. Parish Church of St. Mary can be found in the southern part of that village.

== Village pub and Winyard&#x27;s Gap ==
At the north end of the village where the village road meets the A356 is a 17th century pub known as Winyard&#x27;s Gap Inn. The Inn&#x27;s previous name was the Three Horse Shoes. It became part of the Dorset backdrop for character statements featured in a series of trials at the Old Bailey in 1753. One of the most famous English criminal mysteries of the 18th century. It involved Mary Squires, an ageing gypsy, accused with Mrs Susannah &#x27;Mother&#x27; Wells of carrying out an abduction (Elizabeth Canning) for prostitution, as brothel matrons. They protested they were scapegoats. Mary Squires counter-claimed that she was with the smugglers, in Abbotsbury and Chedington, at the time when the prosecution accused her of cavorting with highwaymen. The magistrate was Henry Fielding (1707–54), who had used similar character material in his earlier novel Tom Jones. He allowed dubious evidence from Elizabeth Canning (1734–73) and an even less credible account from a young lady named Virtue Hall. Squires and Wells were tried and convicted. The newly elected Lord Mayor of London, a notable humanitarian and freeman of the Brewers&#x27; Company named Sir Crisp Gascoyne (1700–61), reviewed fresh evidence and eventually, Mary Squires secured a pardon, but Susannah Wells, was less fortunate as she had already been hanged. Years later the story would be re-told in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s 1906 narrative poem &#x27;A Trampwoman&#x27;s Tragedy&#x27;.

The Inn marks the western end of the Dorset Downs. The wooded viewpoint ridge looks north across most of Somerset from a strategic chalky pass into the Dorset downs. Along here, through Winyard&#x27;s Gap, King Charles led his troops after successful West Country campaigns in 1644 in England during the Civil War.

After the First World War, the National Trust, which owns Winyard&#x27;s Gap, donated 16 acres of land here for a memorial to the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division of the Dorsetshire Regiment and a replica of the monument found on Hill 112 at Caen in Normandy was erected.

== River Parrett Trail ==
Chedington is the starting point of the long River Parrett Trail, a long-distance footpath along the route of the River Parrett, which rises in the village. It passes many landmarks and places of interest including; Burrow Hill Cider Farm, Muchelney Abbey, West Sedgemoor, the Blake Museum, Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum, the site of the Battle of Sedgemoor (July 1685) and finally discharging into Bridgwater Bay.

<text>In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, an Eilenberg–MacLane space is a topological space with a single nontrivial homotopy group.

Let &quot;G&quot; be a group and &quot;n&quot; a positive integer. A connected topological space &quot;X&quot; is called an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type formula_1, if it has &quot;n&quot;-th homotopy group formula_2 isomorphic to &quot;G&quot; and all other homotopy groups trivial. Assuming that &quot;G&quot; is abelian in the case that formula_3, Eilenberg–MacLane spaces of type formula_1 always exist, and are all weak homotopy equivalent. Thus, one may consider formula_1 as referring to a weak homotopy equivalence class of spaces. It is common to refer to any representative as &quot;a formula_1&quot; or as &quot;a model of formula_1&quot;. Moreover, it is common to assume that this space is a CW-complex (which is always possible via CW approximation).

The name is derived from Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane, who introduced such spaces in the late 1940s.

As such, an Eilenberg–MacLane space is a special kind of topological space that in homotopy theory can be regarded as a building block for CW-complexes via fibrations in a Postnikov system. These spaces are important in many contexts in algebraic topology, including computations of homotopy groups of spheres, definition of cohomology operations, and for having a strong connection to singular cohomology.

A generalised Eilenberg–Maclane space is a space which has the homotopy type of a product of Eilenberg–Maclane spaces
formula_8.

==Examples==
* The unit circle formula_9 is a formula_10.
* The infinite-dimensional complex projective space formula_11 is a model of formula_12.
* The infinite-dimensional real projective space formula_13 is a formula_14.
* The wedge sum of &quot;k&quot; unit circles formula_15 is a formula_16, where formula_17 is the free group on &quot;k&quot; generators.
* The complement to any connected knot or graph in a 3-dimensional sphere formula_18 is of type formula_19; this is called the &quot;asphericity of knots&quot;, and is a 1957 theorem of Christos Papakyriakopoulos.
* Any compact, connected, non-positively curved manifold &quot;M&quot; is a formula_20, where formula_21 is the fundamental group of &quot;M&quot;. This is a consequence of the Cartan–Hadamard theorem.
* An infinite lens space formula_22 given by the quotient of formula_23 by the free action formula_24 for formula_25 is a formula_26. This can be shown using covering space theory and the fact that the infinite dimensional sphere is contractible. Note this includes formula_13 as a formula_14.
* The configuration space of formula_29 points in the plane is a formula_30, where formula_31 is the pure braid group on formula_29 strands.
* Correspondingly, the th unordered configuration space of formula_33 is a formula_34, where formula_35 denotes the -strand braid group. 
* The infinite symmetric product formula_36 of a &quot;n&quot;-sphere is a formula_37. More generally formula_38 is a formula_39 for all Moore spaces formula_40.

Some further elementary examples can be constructed from these by using the fact that the product formula_41 is formula_42. For instance the -dimensional Torus formula_43 is a formula_44.

==Constructing Eilenberg–MacLane spaces==
For formula_45 and formula_46 an arbitrary group the construction of formula_47 is identical to that of the classifying space of the group formula_46. Note that if G has a torsion element, then every CW-complex of type K(G,1) has to be infinite-dimensional.

There are multiple techniques for constructing higher Eilenberg-Maclane spaces. One of which is to construct a Moore space formula_49 for an abelian group formula_50: Take the wedge of &quot;n&quot;-spheres, one for each generator of the group &quot;A&quot; and realise the relations between these generators by attaching &quot;(n+1)&quot;-cells via corresponding maps in formula_51 of said wedge sum. Note that the lower homotopy groups formula_52 are already trivial by construction. Now iteratively kill all higher homotopy groups formula_53 by successively attaching cells of dimension greater than formula_54, and define formula_55 as direct limit under inclusion of this iteration.

Another useful technique is to use the geometric realization of simplicial abelian groups. This gives an explicit presentation of simplicial abelian groups which represent Eilenberg-Maclane spaces.

Another simplicial construction, in terms of classifying spaces and universal bundles, is given in J. Peter May&#x27;s book.

Since taking the loop space lowers the homotopy groups by one slot, we have a canonical homotopy equivalence formula_56, hence there is a fibration sequence
:formula_57.
Note that this is not a cofibration sequence ― the space formula_58 is not the homotopy cofiber of formula_59.

This fibration sequence can be used to study the cohomology of formula_58 from formula_1 using the Leray spectral sequence. This was exploited by Jean-Pierre Serre while he studied the homotopy groups of spheres using the Postnikov system and spectral sequences.

==Properties of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces==

===Bijection between homotopy classes of maps and cohomology===
An important property of formula_62&#x27;s is that for any abelian group &quot;G&quot;, and any based CW-complex &quot;X&quot;, the set formula_63 of based homotopy classes of based maps from &quot;X&quot; to formula_64 is in natural bijection with the &quot;n&quot;-th singular cohomology group formula_65 of the space &quot;X&quot;. Thus one says that the formula_66 are representing spaces for singular cohomology with coefficients in &quot;G&quot;. Since
:formula_67
there is a distinguished element formula_68 corresponding to the identity. The above bijection is given by the pullback of that element formula_69. This is similar to the Yoneda lemma of category theory.

A constructive proof of this theorem can be found here, another making use of the relation between omega-spectra and generalized reduced cohomology theories can be found here, and the main idea is sketched later as well. 

=== Loop spaces and Omega spectra ===
The loop space of an Eilenberg–MacLane space is again an Eilenberg–MacLane space: formula_70. Further there is an adjoint relation between the loop-space and the reduced suspension: formula_71, which gives formula_72 the structure of an abelian group, where the operation is the concatenation of loops. This makes the bijection formula_73 mentioned above a group isomorphism.

Also this property implies that Eilenberg–MacLane spaces with various &quot;n&quot; form an omega-spectrum, called an &quot;Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum&quot;. This spectrum defines via formula_74 a reduced cohomology theory on based CW-complexes and for any reduced cohomology theory formula_75 on CW-complexes with formula_76 for formula_77 there is a natural isomorphism formula_78, where formula_79 denotes reduced singular cohomology. Therefore these two cohomology theories coincide.

In a more general context, Brown representability says that every reduced cohomology theory on based CW-complexes comes from an omega-spectrum.

===Relation with homology===
For a fixed abelian group formula_46 there are maps on the stable homotopy groups 
:formula_81
induced by the map formula_82. Taking the direct limit over these maps, one can verify that this defines a reduced homology theory 
:formula_83
on CW complexes. Since formula_84 vanishes for formula_85, formula_86 agrees with reduced singular homology formula_87 with coefficients in G on CW-complexes.

=== Functoriality ===
It follows from the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology that the Eilenberg MacLane space is a &quot;quasi-functor&quot; of the group; that is, for each positive integer formula_29 if formula_89 is any homomorphism of abelian groups, then there is a non-empty set

: formula_90

satisfying formula_91
where formula_92 denotes the homotopy class of a continuous map formula_93 and formula_94

=== Relation with Postnikov/Whitehead towers ===
Every connected CW-complex formula_95 possesses a Postnikov tower, that is an inverse system of spaces:

:formula_96
such that for every formula_97:
#there are commuting maps formula_98, which induce isomorphism on formula_99 for formula_100 ,
#formula_101 for formula_102,
#the maps formula_103 are fibrations with fiber formula_104.

Dually there exists a Whitehead tower, which is a sequence of CW-complexes: 

:formula_105
such that for every formula_29: 
# the maps formula_107 induce isomorphism on formula_108 for formula_109,
# formula_110 is n-connected,
# the maps formula_111 are fibrations with fiber formula_112.

With help of Serre spectral sequences computations of higher homotopy groups of spheres can be made. For instance formula_113 and formula_114 using a Whitehead tower of formula_115 can be found here, more generally those of formula_116 using a Postnikov systems can be found here. 

=== Cohomology operations ===
For fixed natural numbers &quot;m,n&quot; and abelian groups &quot;G,H&quot; exists a bijection between the set of all cohomology operations formula_117 and formula_118 defined by formula_119, where formula_120 is a fundamental class. 

As a result, cohomology operations cannot decrease the degree of the cohomology groups and degree preserving cohomology operations are corresponding
to coefficient homomorphism formula_121. This follows from the Universal coefficient theorem for cohomology and the (m-1)-connectedness of formula_122.

Some interesting examples for cohomology operations are Steenrod Squares and Powers, when formula_123 are finite cyclic groups. When studying those the importance of the cohomology of formula_124 with coefficients in formula_125 becomes apparent quickly; some extensive tabeles of those groups can be found here. 

=== Group (co)homology ===
One can define the group (co)homology of G with coefficients in the group A as the singular (co)homology of the Eilenberg-MacLane space formula_47 with coefficients in A.

=== Further applications ===
The loop space construction described above is used in string theory to obtain, for example, the string group, the fivebrane group and so on, as the Whitehead tower arising from the short exact sequence
:formula_127
with formula_128 the string group, and formula_129 the spin group. The relevance of formula_12 lies in the fact that there are the homotopy equivalences
:formula_131
for the classifying space formula_132, and the fact formula_133. Notice that because the complex spin group is a group extension
:formula_134,
the String group can be thought of as a &quot;higher&quot; complex spin group extension, in the sense of higher group theory since the space formula_12 is an example of a higher group. It can be thought of the topological realization of the groupoid formula_136 whose object is a single point and whose morphisms are the group formula_137. Because of these homotopical properties, the construction generalizes: any given space formula_138 can be used to start a short exact sequence that kills the homotopy group formula_139 in a topological group.

In 1086, in the Domesday Book Cheselbourne was recorded as &quot;Ceseburne&quot;; it had 36 households, of meadow and one mill. It was in the hundred of Hilton and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Shaftesbury Abbey.

Cheselbourne used to be the site of a tradition known as &quot;Treading in the Wheat&quot;, in which young women from the village would walk the fields on Palm Sunday, dressed in white.

At Lyscombe Farm in the northwest of the parish are the remains of an early 13th-century chapel. The nave was once used as a bakehouse and then a farmworker&#x27;s dwelling. In 1957, a Dutch barn was built over the ruins.

<text>The Perendale is a breed of sheep developed in New Zealand by Massey Agricultural College (now Massey University) for use in steep hill situations. The breed is named after Sir Geoffrey Peren, and it achieves its aims by being the offspring of Romney ewes and Cheviot rams with sturdy legs. It is raised primarily for meat.

==History==
Since the early 1980s, the flock numbers of this sheep has increased, mainly because hill-country farming has increased and they are more adaptable to the terrain. 
Developed from the Cheviot and Romney, the Perendale is a dual-purpose sheep producing wool fibres of diameter with a staple length. The Perendale is characteristically a high fertility animal, and has great potential to produce a prime ewe lamb when crossed with the Merino. As a purebred, its hardiness makes it ideally suited to colder, high-rainfall areas. The Perendale is easy to care for; the ewes have little trouble lambing and are good mothers.

==Characteristics==
The mature body weight of a ram is and a ewe is . The average fiber diameter is 29 to 35 microns. The USDA wool grade is 44&#x27;s to 54&#x27;s.

<text>Gloucester ( ), a town in dairy and beef cattle country, is located in Mid-Coast Council, within the Barrington Coast hinterland of the lower Mid North Coast of the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is the closest town to world heritage Barrington Tops National Park.

Gloucester is situated on the North Coast railway line and can be accessed from the southeast from Newcastle, located via the Bucketts Way, or from the north via Thunderbolts Way. Gloucester River flows adjacent to the town, just above its junction with the Avon River.

At the 2016 census, Gloucester had a population of people.

== History ==
The Gloucester district was first visited by government surveyor Henry Dangar in January 1826 and then by Robert Dawson, Chief Agent for the Australian Agricultural Company later in the same year, accompanied by Henry Dangar. Settlement occurred in the 1830s. The township of Gloucester was first established in 1855, primarily for sheep farming, however it became apparent that the land was not entirely suitable. The main industries of the Gloucester area are tourism, timber, and cattle farming. The timber industry has been prevalent in Gloucester since the late 19th century, and it and cattle farming (dairy and beef cattle) are still major industries in and around Gloucester.

In 1876, gold was discovered in Copeland, a small town north-west of Gloucester. Copeland became a large town of over inhabitants due to the gold discovery and the large number of red cedar trees. However, the population has since dwindled to a few hundred.

The Australian Agricultural Company was originally awarded mineral rights to between the Karuah River and the Manning River which covered the Gloucester district. The company employed surveyors in 1856-7 to undertake a trial survey for a railway between Port Stephens and Stroud and further north to the Manning River, passing what became Gloucester. At the time it was felt that with the &quot;formidable obstructions&quot; from ranges and rivers, a railway line would be impracticable and construction did not proceed, and coal mining was abandoned before it had commenced.

In 1923, electricity came to Gloucester. The Gloucester Electric Supply Company Ltd was formed by Fred Lowe, who was called to Gloucester by a syndicate (mainly of local graziers) to assist in the development of a Gloucester electric supply. He presented plans for a ‘turn key’ installation of the complete plant which was accepted by the syndicate. The shareholders in the new company were Fred and his brother Ernest, who jointly held the great majority of the shares, and a number of local people. There were many ups and downs, especially during 1929, the depression. In the middle 1930s, the State Government was offering subsidies for the construction of rural lines. The first rural line along the Bucketts Road was opened on 9 September 1938. Fred Lowe designed and surveyed the line exercising his expertise in surveying which he acquired whilst working in New Zealand as a young man.
In 1943 the company’s 20-year franchise ended. However it was wartime and the Mid-Coast County Council did not exercise its right to acquire the company’s assets and take over the electricity undertaking till 1 July 1946. Fred was employed by the Council as its electrical engineer. He still persisted with rural line extensions and completed the Avon Valley line taking electricity to Stratford. He remained as council electrical engineer until he retired in 1951. At a farewell function the Shire President, Cr. J.N. Channon, said, &quot;We cannot let the opportunity pass without expressing our deep appreciation and gratitude to Mr Lowe for what he has done for Gloucester.&quot;

In 1995, Gloucester Coal, originally Stratford Coal, began mining in Stratford, a small village south of Gloucester. The Stratford mine is now owned by Yancoal and is the only operating coal mine in the valley. Plans by mining company AGL to install 330 coal seam gas wells in the Gloucestor Valley were cancelled in 2016 following a community campaign and blockade of exploration sites.

In March 1972 the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, VC and Lady Cutler toured the district and attended a formal Civic Reception at the Gloucester Bucketts Motel.

For most of the twentieth century it boasted two cinemas in the main thoroughfare - Church Street: The &quot;Star&quot; (opposite &quot;Permewans&quot;, closed c. 1968), and the &quot;Majestic Theatre&quot;, that was built in the early 1920s. The &quot;Majestic&quot; permanently closed its doors c. 1980 and the building still stands, now redeveloped as a shopping arcade.

The district&#x27;s weekly newspaper is &quot;The Gloucester Advocate&quot;.

== Transport ==
Forster Buslines runs route 308 from Forster to Gloucester with one service in each direction on school days.

==Events==
Gloucester was the venue for the first Groovin&#x27; the Moo music festival held at the Gloucester Showground on 24 April 2005. The festival included well known musical acts such as Screaming Jets, Killing Heidi and Evermore. Although the festival has not returned to Gloucester, it has gone on to be an annual event held in regional areas across Australia.

==Population==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 2,390 people in Gloucester.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 10.8% of the population. 
* 87.7% of people were born in Australia and 92.7% of people spoke only English at home.

<text>Chettle is a small village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It lies northeast of Blandford Forum. It is sited at the head of a gently sloping valley on the dip slope of the chalk formation called Cranborne Chase. The A354 trunk road crosses the valley about 1 km to the south. In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 90.

A 2008 report indicated that the entire village was owned by the Bourke family and operated in the mode of &quot;benevolent feudalism&quot;. A news item from 2015 confirmed the ownership and provided the following update about the community:The tiny hamlet, with its hotel, manor house, 40 cottages, farms and lumber yard has belonged to the Bourke family for more than 400 years, in a benign throwback to feudal times.

Chettle House, the village manor, is a red brick Baroque mansion designed by Thomas Archer, a pupil of Vanbrugh, and built by the Bastard brothers of Blandford Forum during the reign of Queen Anne. Pevsner called it &quot;the plum among Dorset houses of the early 18th century, and even nationally outstanding as a specimen of English Baroque&quot;. Two rounded ends were added to the house in 1912. 

From the 1950s to 2015 the house was a series of flats. After 2015, extensive renovations were completed by new owners; the house and gardens were closed to the public.

A book about Chettle, &quot;Enduring Village&quot;, was published in August, 2008.

<text>The Erasmus Programme (&quot;EuRopean Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students&quot;) is a European Union (EU) student exchange programme established in 1987. Erasmus+, or Erasmus Plus, is the new programme combining all the EU&#x27;s current schemes for education, training, youth and sport, the most recent programme covering the years from 2021 to 2027.

== Overview ==
Erasmus+ is the EU&#x27;s programme to support education, training, youth and sport in Europe. The programme involves the 27 EU Member States and 6 non-EU associated countries with 55 National Agencies responsible for the decentralised management of most of the programme&#x27;s actions. Other countries across the world may also participate in certain parts of the programme. The overall responsibility for the programme’s management, direction and evaluation lies with the European Commission (Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture), assisted by its Education, Audio-visual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA).

The objective of Erasmus+ is to promote transnational learning mobility and cooperation, as a mean of improving quality and excellence, supporting inclusion and equity, and boosting innovation in the fields of education, youth and sport. In all these sectors, the aim is to provide support, through lifelong learning, for the educational, professional and personal development of participants in Europe and beyond.

The programme&#x27;s objective is pursued through three key actions:

* Key action 1: Learning mobility of individuals
* Key action 2: Cooperation among organisations and institutions
* Key action 3: Support to policy development and cooperation

Other activities include &quot;Jean Monnet&quot; actions, which support teaching, learning, research and debates on European integration matters, e.g. on the EU&#x27;s future challenges and opportunities. 

Full information on the current profile and the activities for which funding within the programme is available can be found in the Erasmus+ Programme Guide.

Launched in 1987, the Erasmus programme was originally established to promote closer cooperation between universities and higher education institutions across Europe. Over time, the programme has expanded and is now referred to as Erasmus+, or Erasmus Plus, combining the EU&#x27;s different schemes for transnational cooperation and mobility in education, training, youth and sport in Europe and beyond. The Erasmus+ programme concluded its first funding cycle from 2014 to 2020 and is now in its second cycle, spanning from 2021 to 2027. Noted for its participation among staff, students, young people, and learners across age groups, as of 2021, the programme had engaged over 13 million participants. Its name refers to Erasmus of Rotterdam, a leading scholar and inspiring lecturer during the Renaissance period who travelled extensively in Europe to teach and study at a number of universities. At the same time, the word &quot;Erasmus&quot; is also the acronym for &quot;EuRopean Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students&quot;.

In 1989, the Erasmus Bureau invited 32 former Erasmus students for an evaluation meeting in Ghent, Belgium. The lack of peer-to-peer support was singled out as a major issue, but it was also a driving force behind the creation of the Erasmus Student Network. The organization supports students from the Erasmus programme and other bilateral agreements and cooperates with national agencies in order to help international students. As of 23 July 2020, the Erasmus Student Network consists of 534 local associations (&quot;sections&quot;) in 42 countries and has more than 15,000 volunteers across Europe.

As of 2014, 27 years after its creation, the programme had promoted the mobility of more than 3.3 million students within the European community. More than 5,000 higher education institutions from 38 countries are participating in the project.

The Erasmus Programme, along with several other independent programmes, was incorporated into the Socrates programme established by the European Commission in 1994. The Socrates programme ended on 31 December 1999 and was replaced with the Socrates II programme on 24 January 2000, which in turn was replaced by the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 on 1 January 2007.

Beside the more popular student mobility (SMS), the Erasmus+ programme promotes the teacher mobility (STA), by which university teachers can spend a short period, for a minimum of 2 teaching days and a maximum of 2 months, teaching at least 8 hours in a foreign partner university. The average and suggested stay is of 5 teaching days.

==Background and history==

===Origins of the name===

The programme is named after the Dutch philosopher, theologian, Renaissance Humanist, monk, and devout Roman Catholic, Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam, called &quot;the crowning glory of the Christian humanists&quot;. Erasmus, along with his good friend Thomas More, became one of the main figures of European intellectual life during the Renaissance. Known for his satire, Erasmus urged internal reform of the Catholic Church. He encouraged a recovery of the Catholic Patristic tradition against what he considered to be contemporary abuses of the Sacraments and certain excessive devotional practices. He famously clashed with Protestant revolutionary Martin Luther on the subject of free will. ERASMUS is a backronym meaning &quot;European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students&quot;. Erasmus travelled widely across Europe and he was a pioneer of the European Republic of Letters. He was one of the first intellectuals to use as a vehicle of diffusion of his ideas a path-breaking technology, namely the movable type and spent a lot of his time inside printing workshops.

The programme&#x27;s origins can be traced through a series of significant events documented on the official European Commission programme page:

* From 1973 to 1976, the first European-level education action programme was established.

* Between 1976 and 1987, the foundations for what would later become Erasmus were laid through the &quot;Joint Study Programme&quot; (JSP) scheme in higher education. The organisation and execution of the JSP was entrusted to the European Cultural Foundation. This initiative gained traction as more universities and students participated, contributing to the development of mobility, partnership, and joint curricula.

* From 1985 to 1987, the &quot;Erasmus&quot; proposal was developed and negotiated. In 1985, the Directorate for Education and Training presented the proposal to the Council and European Parliament. The Council officially adopted the &quot;Erasmus&quot; programme on June 15, 1987, and it was officially launched on July 1, 1987. The responsibility for the central operations office of the programme was in the hands of the European Cultural Foundation until 1995.

In 1969, the concept of promoting cultural, social, and academic exchanges among European students took root, thanks to the efforts of Italian educator and scientific consultant Sofia Corradi for the permanent conference of Italian university rectors. Her role allowed her to raise awareness about this idea and make it known in the academic and institutional spheres. The project was born after an initiative of the EGEE student association (now AEGEE) founded by Franck Biancheri (who later became president of the trans-European movement Newropeans) which in 1986–1987 convinced French president François Mitterrand to support the creation of the Erasmus programme.

This active collaboration between AEGEE and the European Commission and especially Domenico Lenarduzzi, Ministry of Public Education, allowed the approval of the Erasmus programme in 1987. It became an integral part of the Socrates I (1994–1999) and Socrates II (2000–2006) programmes. From 2007 it became one of the elements of the Lifelong Learning Programme (2007–2013).

In June 1984, the European Council decided in Fontainebleau to establish an ad-hoc European citizens&#x27; committee with the mission to make proposals to improve the image of the European Union. Each council member would select a member and together they should present a set of proposals to be approved at a future European Council. Under the chairmanship of Pietro Adonnino, the committee presented two successive reports that were approved at the Council session in Milan on the 28–29 of June 1985. Under the proposals that were advanced in these reports was the suggestion (to be found in the second report from number 5.6: University Cooperation) that the ministers for education and universities and higher-education establishments
# should establish a cross-frontier cooperation enabling students to pursue part of their studies in an establishment in a member state other than their own;
# should implement, a comprehensive European inter-university programme of exchanges and studies aimed at giving this opportunity to a significant section of the EU&#x27;s student population.
These suggestions were advanced by the Belgian member Prosper Thuysbaert and were discussed and approved by the committee.

===1987 European Commission proposal===
By the time the Erasmus Programme was adopted in June 1987, the European Commission had been supporting pilot student exchanges for six years. It proposed the original Erasmus Programme in early 1986, but reaction from the then member states varied: those with substantial exchange programmes of their own (essentially France, Germany and the United Kingdom) were broadly hostile; the remaining countries were broadly in favour. Exchanges between the member states and the European Commission deteriorated, and the latter withdrew the proposal in early 1987 to protest against the inadequacy of the triennial budget proposed by some member states.

===European Court of Justice decision===
This method of voting, a simple majority, was not accepted by some of the opposing member states, who challenged the adoption of the decision before the European Court of Justice. Although the court held that the adoption was procedurally flawed, it maintained the substance of the decision; a further decision, adapted in the light of the jurisprudence, was rapidly adopted by the Council of Ministers.

===Adoption and growth===
The programme built on the 1981–1986 pilot student exchanges, and although it was formally adopted only shortly before the beginning of the academic year 1987–1988, it was still possible for 3,244 students to participate in Erasmus in its first year. In 2006, over 150,000 students, or almost 1% of the European student population, took part. The proportion is higher among university teachers, where Erasmus teacher mobility is 1.9% of the teacher population in Europe, or 20,877 people.

From 1987 to 2006, over two million students benefited from Erasmus grants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Survey of the Socio-Economic Background of Erasmus Students - DG EAC 01/05&quot;&gt;Ec.europa.eu , Table: Erasmus student mobility (number of outgoing students): 1987/88-2006/07&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Erasmus Programme was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation.

===Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013===
After 2007, the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 replaced the Socrates programme as the overall umbrella under which the Erasmus (and other) programmes operated.

===Erasmus Mundus===

The Erasmus Mundus programme is a parallel programme oriented towards globalising European education and is open to non-Europeans with Europeans being exceptional cases.

===Citizens&#x27; initiative for more money 2014–2020===
In May 2012, Fraternité 2020 was registered as Europe&#x27;s first European Citizens&#x27; Initiative and a goal to increase the budget for EU exchange programmes like Erasmus or the European Voluntary Service starting in 2014. It ultimately collected only 71,057 signatures from citizens across the EU out of 1 million signatures needed by 1 November 2013.

===Erasmus+ Programme 2014–2020===
Erasmus+, also called Erasmus Plus, has been the new 14.7 billion euro catch-all framework programme for education, training, youth and sport from 2014 to 2020. The Erasmus+ programme combined all the EU&#x27;s schemes for education, training, youth and sport, including the Lifelong Learning Programme (Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig), Youth in Action and five international co-operation programmes (Erasmus Mundus, Tempus, Alfa, Edulink and the programme for co-operation with industrialised countries). The Erasmus+ regulation was signed on 11 December 2013.

Erasmus+ provided grants for a wide range of actions including the opportunity for students to undertake work placements abroad and for teachers and education staff to attend training courses. Projects are divided into two parts – formal and non-formal education – each of them with three key actions. Erasmus+ key action one provides an opportunity for teachers, headmasters, trainers and other staff of education institutions to participate in international training courses in different European countries.

The staff home institution must apply to receive the grant to send its staff members abroad for training.

Erasmus+ conducted projects in Central Asia&#x27;s Kazakhstan, funding 40 projects involving 47 Kazakh universities with more than 35.5 million euros.

With Brexit, the UK government decision not to participate in Erasmus+ meant UK students (9,993 in 2018) lost access to the Erasmus programme and EU students (29,797 in 2018) lost access to UK universities, despite some Conservatives such as Suella Braverman having benefitted from it and promises made by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson that &quot;There is no threat to the ERASMUS scheme.&quot; The UK decided to utilise the funds that would have been paid into Erasmus+ to create the Turing scheme, allowing 40,000 students p.a., from age 4 to university age, to gain experience overseas, without being limited to European destinations.

===Erasmus+ Programme 2021–2027===

On 30 May 2018, the European Commission adopted its proposal for the next Erasmus programme, with a doubling of the budget to 30 billion euros for the period 2021–2027. Further negotiations were expected to take place during the 2019–2024 European parliamentary term with the European Parliament and the European Council before the final programme is adopted. The agreement between the European Parliament and the European Council was adopted and the publication of the new regulation 2021/817 establishing the new Erasmus+ programme was made on 28 May 2021.

For the second phase of the programme, the EU has made the commitment to expand Erasmus+ further and to enrich it by introducing a new &#x27;greening&#x27; dimension as well as a strong new digital education component. The new greening dimension is designed to contribute to combating climate change and addressing other global challenges including health, while the digital education strand seeks in particular to improve the quality of online education in Europe which has grown considerably in the aftermath of the Covid 19 pandemic. Further transversal priorities for the programme are the commitment to social inclusion and diversity, and to promoting stronger participation in democratic life, common values and civic engagement.

==Participation and impact of the programme==

Nearly 14 million people have participated in the Erasmus programme since its creation. The young participants has increased significantly since 1987. Nearly 300,000 a year compared with only 3,244 in 1987. Spain is the country that has allowed most people to participate in Erasmus with more than 40,000 per year, slightly ahead of France, Germany and Italy. The countries receiving the most Erasmus students are Spain with more than 47,000 students and Germany with 32,800. Erasmus has positively impacted higher education, bringing educational, social, cultural, and economic benefits to institutions. It professionalizes international cooperation, strengthens academic ties, fosters research collaborations, and forms informal networks, creating friendships across borders. The programme has become a valued source of &#x27;soft power&#x27; and diplomatic value for participating countries. There are currently more than 4,000 higher institutions participating in Erasmus across the 37 countries. In 2012–13, 270,000 took part, the most popular destinations being Spain, Germany, Italy and France. Erasmus students represented 5 percent of European graduates as of 2012.

Studies have discussed issues related to the selection into the programme and the representativeness of the participants. Some studies have raised doubts about the inclusiveness of the programme, by socio-economic background, level of study, or academic performance. Thus, one study analyses the financial issues and family background of Erasmus students, showing that despite the fact that access to the programme has been moderately widened, there are still important socio-economic barriers to participation in the programme. Another study uncovered what seems to be an adverse self-selection of Erasmus students based on their prior academic performance, with higher-performing students less likely to participate than lower-performing ones. However, this case was based on four hundred graduates in only a Spanish university. Inversely, one study looking in details at French and Italian students found that the primary predictor of participation to Erasmus was students&#x27; prior academic records, not the occupation of their parents.

===Requirements===
The Erasmus Programme had previously been restricted to applicants who had completed at least one year of tertiary-level study, but it is now also available to secondary school students. Indeed, non-formal education programmes for adults, can expand opportunities for its students and staff through the development of international partnerships following the priorities of the Programme, such as inclusion and diversity, digital transformation, environment and climate change or participation in democratic life.

===Details===
Students who join the Erasmus Programme study at least three months or do an internship for a period of at least 2 months to an academic year in another European country. The former case is called a Student Mobility for Studies or SMS, while the latter case is called a Student Mobility of Placement or SMP. The Erasmus Programme guarantees that the period spent abroad is recognised by their university when they come back, as long as they abide by terms previously agreed. Switzerland has been suspended as a participant in the Erasmus programme as of 2015, following the popular vote to limit the immigration of EU citizens into Switzerland. As a consequence, Swiss students will not be able to apply for the programme and European students will not be able to spend time at a Swiss university under that programme.

A main part of the programme is that students do not pay extra tuition fees to the university that they visit. Students can also apply for an Erasmus grant to help cover the additional expense of living abroad. Students with disabilities can apply for an additional grant to cover extraordinary expenses.

To reduce expenses and increase mobility, many students also use the European Commission-supported accommodation network, CasaSwap, FlatClub, Erasmusinn, Eurasmus, Erasmate or Student Mundial, which are free websites where students and young people can rent, sublet, offer and swap accommodation – on a national and international basis. A derived benefit is that students can share knowledge and exchange tips and hints with each other before and after going abroad.

=== Impact ===
Erasmus has positively impacted higher education, bringing educational, social, cultural, and economic benefits to institutions. It professionalises international cooperation, strengthens academic ties, fosters research collaborations, and forms informal networks, creating friendships across borders. The programme has become a valued source of &#x27;soft power&#x27; and diplomatic value for participating countries.

External evaluations and a multitude of personal stories abound from successive generations of participants to confirm the extent to which their &quot;Erasmus experience&quot; provided them not only with enhanced knowledge and competence in their respective fields, but also with a transformative, life-enhancing dimension both in personal terms and for their careers. This is true of all parts of the programme forming the present Erasmus+, though most data is available for higher education.

== Erasmus in the media and popular culture ==

=== The &quot;Erasmus experience&quot; ===
For many higher education students, the Erasmus Programme is their first time living and studying in another country. Alongside academic study or practical training, the programme fosters learning and understanding of the host country, and the Erasmus experience is considered both a time for learning as well as a chance to socialize and experience a different culture, not to mention self-discovery. In this respect, and thanks to its popularity among students, it has emerged as a contemporary cultural phenomenon, inspiring books and films that explore the Erasmus experience.

=== Films ===
Most of the characters in the French-Spanish film &quot;L&#x27;Auberge espagnole&quot; (2002) are enrolled in the programme, which plays a central role in the film. 

Various documentary films have been produced around the programme, notably the Italian documentary &quot;Erasmus 24 7&quot; or Erasmus, notre plus belle année (2017).

=== Books ===
The self-finding experiences of Erasmus students in France form the basis for Davide Faraldi&#x27;s first novel &quot;Generazione Erasmus&quot; (2008).

In David Mitchell&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Slade House&quot;, an Erasmus party is the scene for an important experience for fresher student Sally Timms.

Pakistani novelist Nimra Ahmed&#x27;s novel &quot;Jannat K Patte&quot; (&quot;Leaves of Heaven&quot;) is based on the Erasmus programme, where the protagonist Haya goes to Sabancı University in Turkey through Erasmus Mundus, which marks a turning point in her life.

In the novel &quot;Normal People&quot; (2018) written by Irish author Sally Rooney and its subsequent adaptation for television, Marianne goes to Sweden via the Erasmus programme.

=== &quot;Cafébabel&quot; ===
The online public forum &quot;Cafébabel&quot; was founded in 2001 by Erasmus exchange programme students, and is headquartered in Paris. The forum is based on the principle of participatory journalism. As of June 2020 it had over 15,000 contributors as well as a team of professional editors and journalists in Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid and Berlin. Volunteer contributors simultaneously translate the forum into six languages – French, English, German, Italian, Spanish and Polish.

==The Erasmus generation==
Some academics have speculated that former Erasmus students will prove to be a powerful force in creating a pan-European identity. In 2005, the political scientist Stefan Wolff, for example, argued that &quot;Give it 15, 20 or 25 years, and Europe will be run by leaders with a completely different socialisation from those of today&quot;, referring to the so-called &#x27;Erasmus generation&#x27;. This term describes young Europeans who participate in Erasmus programme and are assumed to support European integration more actively when compared with their elder generations. The assumption is that young Europeans, who enjoyed the benefits of European integration, think of themselves as European citizens, and therefore create a base of support for further European integration. However, questions are raised about whether there is positive correlation between the programme and pro-European integration.

According to the former European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, Tibor Navracsics, Erasmus programme is a soft power tool and it reflects the political motivation behind its creation, including the task of legitimising the European institutions. This conception has already presented in the project of Sofia Corradi, an Italian educationalist creator of the Erasmus Programme. She gives a particular attention to the need to activate an exchange between young people from all over Europe to contribute to the strengthening of its unity and integrity.

One issue discussed is whether participation in the Erasmus programma helps generate more European solidarity. A study carried out by the European Commission in 2010, shows that participating to Erasmus strengthens tolerance. Another issue is whether Erasmus enables the mixing of Europeans. For example, more than a quarter of Erasmus participants meet their life partner through it and participation in Erasmus encourages mobility between European countries. Umberto Eco called it sexual integration. The European Commission estimates that the program has resulted directly in the births of over 1 million children, sometimes called &quot;Erasmus Babies&quot;.

As to whether Erasmus fosters a sense of European identity the results are mixed. Some research indicates that those participating in Erasmus exchanges are already significantly predisposed to be pro-European, leading some scholars to conclude that such exchange programmes are &#x27;preaching to the converted&#x27;. However, more recent research has criticised the earlier findings for being methodically flawed, relying primarily on the experience of British students and for using relatively small samples. Relying on a larger scale survey conducted on some 1700 students in six countries, Mitchell found that &#x27;participation in an Erasmus exchange is significantly and positively related to changes in both identification as European and identification with Europe&#x27;. In addition, it has also been submitted that the earlier literature confused cause and effect, since the existence of such programmes constitutes a tangible benefit provided by the EU to prospective students interested in going abroad, which may cause them to view the EU positively even prior to participation.

<doc id="1073270" wikidata="Q7226067" url="?curid=1073270" title="Polwarth sheep">
<text>Polwarth is a breed of sheep that was developed in Victoria, Australia in 1880. They were of one-quarter Lincoln and three-quarters Merino bloodlines. They are large, predominantly polled sheep with long, soft, fine wool and produce good meat carcasses. They were developed in an attempt to extend the grazing territory of the sheep because the Merino was found lacking in hardiness in this respect. They are a dual-purpose (meat and wool) breed with a major emphasis on wool production. Richard Dennis of Tarndwarncoort in southwest Victoria bred the Polwarth, first known as Dennis Comebacks. Descendants of Dennis&#x27; sheep continue to grow Polwarth wool at Tarndwarncoort, maintaining the original bloodlines in a flock referred to as the &quot;Blue Dots&quot;.

==Wool==
Polwarth wool is well regarded for its application in woolcraft. The longer staple length, up to 130mm, makes it easy for handspinning and felting. The wool is soft enough to wear against skin, and is known for its drape. Millspun yarns made solely of Polwarth wool are commercially available.

Polwarth sheep were developed with white wool; however, natural black, brown, and grey wool flocks have expanded the popularity of Polwarth wool for craft.

==Characteristics==
Mature ewes weigh and mature rams weigh . Ewes are excellent prime lamb mothers, producing lambs that have good lean carcasses. The high-yielding fleeces weigh an average six to seven kilograms, with a fibre diameter of 23 to 25 microns (58–60s).

==Economy==
The Polwarth Sheepbreeders&#x27; Association of Australia was formed in 1918 and the studbook closed in 1948.

Polwarths are now raised mostly in the higher rainfall regions of south-eastern Australia that have improved pastures. Polwarths have been exported into many countries, including South America, where they are known as &quot;Ideals&quot;. Polwarth and Corriedale form the main sheep breeds on the Falkland Islands.

<text>The  was a Japanese manufacturer of military aircraft during World War II. While it mainly manufactured other firms&#x27; designs, it was notable for the radical J7W &quot;Shinden&quot; fighter. Named after Kyushu island where the company was based.

The company originated from Fukuoka-based &quot;Watanabe Tekkōjo&quot; (Watanabe Steel Foundry), which started building aircraft in 1935. In 1943 the aircraft division was spun off as &quot;Kyūshū Hikōki&quot;, while the original company was renamed &quot;Kyūshū Heiki&quot; (Kyūshū Armaments).

After the war, the company was renamed &quot;Watanabe Jidōsha Kōgyō&quot; (Watanabe Automobile Industries) and manufactured automobile bodies and parts. It was dissolved in 2001.

<text>The Joint Declaration of the European Ministers of Education convened in Bologna on 19 June 1999 is the main guiding document of the Bologna process. It was adopted by ministers of education of 29 European countries at their meeting in Bologna in 1999.

It proposed a European Higher Education Area in which students and graduates could move freely between countries, using prior qualifications in one country as acceptable entry requirements for further study in another.

The principal aims agreed were:

# &quot;Adoption of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees&quot;. That is to say, countries should adopt common terminology and standards
# &quot;Adoption of a system essentially based on two main cycles, undergraduate and graduate. Access to the second cycle [graduate education] shall require successful completion of first cycle lasting a minimum of three years. The degree awarded after the first cycle shall also be relevant to the European labour market as an appropriate level of qualification. The second cycle should lead to the master and/or doctorate degree as in many European countries.&quot;

The Bergen meeting subsequently refined the second point, and produced a three-cycle framework of qualifications, which in the UK terminology (adopted, at least partially, by many European countries) would be Bachelor for a first degree of three years, Master for subsequent study, and Doctor for a degree which has &quot;made a contribution through original research that extends the frontier of knowledge by developing a substantial body of work&quot;.

The Bologna declaration has later been followed up a series of meetings between EU ministers. Each meeting has produced a communiqué based on their deliberations. To date these include the Prague communiqué (2001), the Berlin communiqué (2003), the Bergen communiqué (2005), the London communiqué (2007), the Leuven &amp; Louvain-la-Neuve communiqué (2009).

European Commission has published ( European Communities, Feb. 2009) an &quot;ECTS Users&#x27; Guide&quot;, including one &quot;Overview of national regulations (...)&quot; and &quot;Status of the proclamation&quot;.

The Bologna Ministerial Anniversary Conference 2010 in Budapest and Vienna was held in March 2010. It issued the Budapest-Vienna Declaration.

The communiqués indicate that progress is being made towards the Bologna Declaration&#x27;s aim of a European Higher Education Area, however such an area is not universally accepted as being a desirable outcome.

According to the Budapest-Vienna declaration, the next Ministerial Meeting was held in Bucharest on 26–27 April 2012.

<text>The Public University of Navarre (; ), also known by its acronym UPNA or NUP, is a public university created in 1987 by the government of the Spanish autonomous region of Navarre (, Basque: &quot;Nafarroa&quot;). It has three campuses, located in Pamplona and Tudela. Its activity began in 1989.

The main campus is located in Pamplona, in the outskirts of the city, near CA Osasuna&#x27;s El Sadar Stadium, and a new campus was opened in Tudela, a city in southern Navarre, in the 2008 - 2009 academic year. The Health Sciences Faculty (Spanish: Facultad de &quot;Ciencias de la Salud&quot;) was placed off-campus near the city&#x27;s two biggest hospitals.

Currently there are about 10,000 students enrolled in twenty-five different degrees, the most popular of which are Business Administration and several different engineering degrees.

There are also many foreign students taking part in the Erasmus programme, International Student Exchange Programs, Virrey Palafox, or other exchange programs.

== History ==
The Public University of Navarre was created in 1987 by the Parliament of Navarre, as an initiative by then president Gabriel Urralburu. In 1989, classes started in &quot;El Sario&quot; building, and the construction of the main building of the campus (&quot;Aulario&quot;) began. In 1990, the library and department buildings were finished. In 1993, the university elected its first rector. In 1995, they approved their first statutes, and in 1996 it already had 10,000 registered students.

In 1997, the &quot;Grupo 9 de Universidades&quot; (G9 of Universities) was founded as an alliance between nine Spanish universities, with its headquarters being in the &quot;Arrosadia&quot; Campus of the Public University of Navarre.

In 1998, both the dining room and the cafeteria were inaugurated. Two years later it already had a sports center (the &quot;Pabellón Universitario de Navarra&quot;), a modern facility with fronton, sports court and swimming pool.

In 2006, the university began its activities in Tudela. A year later it opened the student resident &quot;Los Abedules&quot;, and in 2008 the Tudela campus was finished. That year they also celebrated the first plenary session of the Student Council. In 2011, Campus Iberus was created, a consortium with the universities of Zaragoza, Lleida and La Rioja, which serves as an international excellence campus for universities located alongside the riverbank of the Ebro. In 2019, they began teaching a degree in Medicine, and in 2022 the university surpassed 10,000 pre-registrations.

Since the year 1998, the Brunet Foundation, part of the university, awards the Jaime Brunet International Prize and the Jaime Brunet University Prize.

==Demography==
At the 2011 census Chickerell&#x27;s population was 5,515. Most of the residents (97.4%) considered themselves to be of a white, British ethnicity. Some 18% of the population were under 15, 2.8% were 16 or 17, 25.9% were between 18 and 44, 22.3% were 45 to 59, and the largest proportion (32.3%) were over 60 years of age. The birth rate in Chickerell exceeds the death rate and there is a net inward migration resulting in a steady increase of the population.

<text>The Asbestos strike of 1949, based in and around the town of Asbestos, Quebec, Canada, was a four-month labour dispute by asbestos miners. It has traditionally been portrayed as a turning point in Quebec history that helped lead to the Quiet Revolution. It also helped launch the careers of Jean Marchand, Gérard Pelletier, and Pierre Trudeau.

== Events ==
At midnight on February 14, 1949, miners walked off the job at four asbestos mines in the Eastern Townships, near Asbestos, Quebec and Thetford Mines. Though these mines were owned by either American or English-Canadian companies, almost all the workers were francophones. The largest company was the American Johns-Manville firm. The union had several demands. These included the elimination of asbestos dust inside and outside of the mill; a fifteen cent an hour general wage increase; a five-cent an hour increase for night work; a social security fund to be administered by the union; the implementation of the Rand Formula; and &quot;double time&quot; payment for work on Sundays and holidays. These demands were radical in Quebec at the time, and the owners rejected them.

On February 13, 1949, the workers voted to strike. The National Federation of Mining Industry Employees and the Canadian Catholic Federation of Labour represented the workers. Jean Marchand was the general secretary of the latter and is often seen as the de facto leader of the strike. 

The strike was illegal. Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis sided strongly with the companies, largely due to his hostility to all forms of socialism. The provincial government sent squads of police to protect the mines. Duplessis&#x27; Union Nationale party had long been closely allied with the Catholic Church, but parts of the church would move to support the workers. The population and media of Quebec were sympathetic to the strikers. The lead reporter for &quot;Le Devoir&quot; was Gérard Pelletier, who was deeply sympathetic to the cause of the workers. Pierre Elliott Trudeau also covered the strike in a sympathetic manner.

Six weeks into the strike, Johns-Manville hired strikebreakers to keep the mines open. The community was deeply divided as some of the workers crossed the picket lines. The strike turned violent as the 5000 strikers attacked, destroying the property of the &quot;scabs&quot; and intimidating them through force. More police were sent to protect the strikebreakers. The striking miners and police fought on the picket line and hundreds of miners were arrested. Some of the incidents included: On March 14, a dynamite explosion destroyed part of a railroad track that led into the Johns-Manville Corporation Canadian subsidiary property. On March 16, strikers overturned a company jeep, injuring a passenger.

Strikers had the support of Canadian unions and some of the Catholic Church in Quebec. The Catholic Church, which had until that time been largely supportive of the Union Nationale government of Duplessis, profoundly affected the strike. Some priests backed the companies, but most sided with the strikers. On March 5, Archbishop Joseph Charbonneau delivered a fiercely pro-union speech asking all Catholics to donate to help the strikers. Premier Duplessis asked the church to transfer the archbishop to Vancouver because of his encouragement of the strike. The church refused, signaling a dramatic change in Quebec society. Charbonneau did resign and became the chaplain at a hospital in Victoria, British Columbia.

On May 5, the strikers launched an effort to shut down the mine in Asbestos by barricading the mine and every road into and out of town. Police attempts to force their way through the barricades failed. The strikers backed down when the police pledged to open fire on the strikers. The next day, the riot act was read and mass arrests of the strikers had begun, including a raid on the church. The arrested strikers were beaten and their leaders severely battered.

After the arrests, the unions decided that they must compromise, and began negotiations with the company. Archbishop Maurice Roy, of Quebec City, served as mediator. In June, the workers agreed to return to work with few gains. When the dispute ended, miners received a small pay increase, but many never regained their jobs.

== Significance ==
One of the most violent and bitter labour disputes in Quebec and Canadian history, the strike led to great upheaval in Quebec society. The strike was in large part led by Jean Marchand, a labour unionist. Journalist Gérard Pelletier and future Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, then a journalist, also played significant roles. Marchand, Pelletier and Trudeau would eventually become prominent Canadian politicians and were known later in their political careers as &quot;Les Trois Colombes&quot; (&quot;the Three Wise Men&quot;). They would largely establish the direction of Quebec federalism for a generation. 

Trudeau edited a book, &quot;The Asbestos Strike&quot;, that presented the strike as the origin of modern Quebec, portraying it as &quot;a violent announcement that a new era had begun.&quot; Some historians argue that the strikers were simply pursuing better conditions and that the resulting change in society was an unintended byproduct.

Popular opinion for most of the strike was broadly supportive of the striking workers. This support, beyond its moral value, manifested itself through monetary support and the supply of provisions. It is likely that the strike would have quickly failed had it not been for the establishment of this kind of support.

In 2004, a French-language book about the strike by author-historian Esther Delisle and Pierre K. Malouf was published under the title &quot;Le Quatuor d&#x27;Asbestos&quot;.

<text>OsCommerce (styled &quot;osCommerce&quot; - &quot;open source Commerce&quot;) is an e-commerce software solution. It can be used on any web server that has PHP and MySQL installed. It is available as free software under the GNU General Public License.

==History==
OsCommerce was started in March 2000 in Germany by Harald Ponce de Leon. The open source project was known as &quot;The Exchange Project&quot;. In its infancy, osCommerce was referred to by Ponce de Leon as &quot;a side thing&quot; and &quot;an example research study&quot;. By late 2001, a team formed for its development and in the words of Harald Ponce de Leon, this was the point the team started taking the project seriously. By 2005, over 2000 websites used osCommerce, and in 2009 this amount grew to 13,000. As of January 2024, BuiltWith reported 39,734 currently live sites using osCommerce.

In 2021, the Holbi Group purchased osCommerce from Ponce De Leon and announced their intention to create 4.x. Its release was eventually scheduled for March 2022, however it was delayed due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On 16 November 2021, osCommerce v4 Beta 1 was released to the limited number of Beta testers 

osCommerce v4 Beta 2 was released on 26 January 2022 to multiple Beta testers 

osCommerce v4 Public demo was released on 1 June 2022 

osCommerce v4 was released as a free shopping cart and open source Ecommerce platform on 25 July 2022 Major differences from the old versions was the use of the latest server software, separation of code and design, osCommerce App Shop and Apps (free and paid), introduction of multiple sale channels, multiple design templates, built in WYSIWYG editor.

==Official Version==

The current version is 4.0.

Previous versions and Add Ons for them were removed from osCommerce.com as they were made obsolete.

==Branches==
Distributed under the GNU General Public License, osCommerce is one of the earliest PHP based Open Source shopping cart software distributions. It inspired the creation of many other online store platforms, such as Magento. It has also spawned a number of forks, such as Zen Cart, xt:Commerce, oscMAX and Phoenix.

==Publicised vulnerabilities (old versions)==
In August 2011 three vulnerabilities in version 2.2 of the osCommerce system were exploited, allowing the addition of an iframe and JavaScript code to infect visitors to websites. Armorize reports this allowed infected web pages to hit 90,000 in a very short time until it was noticed and increasing further to 4.5 million pages within the space of a week.

OsCommerce 2.3 was made available in November 2011 and patched the exploited security holes.

When the demand for a responsive version of osCommerce 2.3 increased, community members took it upon themselves to develop one. Often referred to as osCommerce 2.3 (BS), it later evolved into a fork called Phoenix Cart.

<doc id="1073306" wikidata="Q1992917" url="?curid=1073306" title="Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013">
<text>The Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 (previously referred to as the &quot;Integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning&quot; or the &quot;Integrated programme&quot;) was the European Union programme for education and training.

==Introduction==
The Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 was established by &quot;Decision No.1720/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006&quot;. It was the single financial instrument available to the Commission for its directly managed education and training policies during the period covered by the European Union&#x27;s 2007–2013 financial perspective. The Programme continued the main actions launched under previous action programmes (in particular, it brings together the various actions financed under the Socrates programme and the Leonardo da Vinci programme). It had six sub-programmes:

*The Comenius programme, supporting actions for schools (from pre-primary schools to upper secondary or equivalent)
*The Erasmus programme, supporting exchanges of students in higher education, as well as cooperation between universities and colleges, etc.;
*The Leonardo da Vinci programme, supporting actions in initial and continuing professional education (including student and apprentice exchanges, cooperation between colleges, etc.)
*The Grundtvig programme, supporting actions in the field of adult education
*The Transversal programme covering activities in four themed areas across all sectors of education and training: policy cooperation and innovation in education and training; foreign language teaching; development of ICT-based content and services, such as Euroguidance and Ploteus; and dissemination of results of the programme;
*The Jean Monnet Programme, supporting institutions and actions in favour of European integration.

==Objectives==
The Programme&#x27;s objectives are first, to support the development of quality lifelong learning (a reference to the first paragraphs of Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty of Rome, which establish the European Union&#x27;s duties in education and training in those terms); and thereafter to help member states of the European Union develop their own education and training systems. Although the objectives are expressed in somewhat abstract terms, they are underpinned by actions which concentrate on the creation of links between people, institutions and countries in education and training – what the programme describes as the &quot;European Dimension&quot; of education and training.

==Actions supported==
The programme supports exchanges and connections between people, institutions and countries within the European Union and the European Economic Area.

===Exchanges between individuals===
These include (for example):

*Erasmus Student exchanges of between 3 and 12 months, in which students leave their home university and follow an agreed part of their course at another university in another country. No additional fees are payable, and the course is recognised by the home institution as part of course-work for the degree. Over 150,000 students did Erasmus student exchanges in the academic year 2005/6, and the cumulative total since 1987 is over 1,500,000.
*In-service training courses in school or adult education. The Comenius and Grundtvig programmes support participation in specific short work placements (internships) for professional students in companies in another country, to help them complete their skills

===Exchanges between institutions===
These include (for example):

*Developing partnerships between schools in different countries (&quot;Comenius partnerships&quot;) to run joint projects for and with their pupils.
*Similar projects are supported in the field of adult education by the Grundtvig programme.
*Joint projects run by universities in different countries to develop joint curricula, run short-term intensive programmes, or establish thematic networks in different disciplines

=== Connections between countries ===
These include (for example):
* Study visits for regional and national administrators in education, training and guidance
* Networks of national experts working together on issues of common interest.
* Publication of comparable statistics indicating how the various education and training systems are progressing.

==Programme mechanics==
The management of the programme was very largely decentralised to a network of &quot;national agencies&quot;, nominated by the participating countries. All individual mobility schemes and partnerships, and many multilateral projects, will be funded through these agencies. A limited number of projects will be handled centrally either by the European Commission itself or through its Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency – a public agency funded by the Commission and operating on its behalf.

== Funding ==
The Programme has an indicative total budget of €6.970 billion over the seven years 2007–2013. Minimum seven-year allocations for each of the four bigger programmes are laid down as follows:
# Erasmus programme: 40% (€2.788 billion)
# Leonardo da Vinci programme: 25% (€1.743 billion)
# Comenius programme: 13% (€0.906 billion)
# Grundtvig programme: 4% (€0.279 billion)

The remaining budget was to be spent on other actions and administrative costs. Experience of previous programmes suggests that the final seven-year budget will slightly exceed the current estimate

<text>USS &quot;Badger&quot; (DD–126) was a United States Navy in commission from 1919 to 1922 and from 1930 to 1945. She saw service during World War II. She was named for Commodore Oscar C. Badger.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Badger&quot; was launched on 24 August 1918 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Henry F. Bryan, granddaughter of Commodore Badger. She was commissioned on 29 May 1919.

==Service history==
===Pre-World War II===
Following her commissioning, &quot;Badger&quot; reported to the United States Atlantic Fleet. She steamed to the Mediterranean, where she cruised until August 1919. Upon her return to the United States East Coast, she was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, arriving at San Diego, California, in September 1919. She served at various naval bases on the United States West Coast until May 1922, when she was decommissioned.

Upon recommissioning in January 1930, &quot;Badger&quot; served with the Battle Force and Scouting Force in the Pacific. In April 1933, she returned to the Atlantic and thereafter participated in coastal cruises and reserve training. From 1938 to 1939, she operated with Special Squadron 4 based at Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. Upon her return to Norfolk, Virginia, she joined Destroyer Division 53, Patrol Force, with additional summer assignments to the Midshipmen Coastal Cruise Detachment.

From March to April 1941, &quot;Badger&quot; was refitted to better equip her for escort duties. Her gun armament and two triple mounts of torpedo tubes were removed, replaced by six 3&quot;/50 caliber dual-purpose guns. Two triple torpedo tube mounts were retained, and an improved anti-submarine armament of 24 depth charges was fitted.

===World War II===
The United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941. Between December 1941 and October 1944, &quot;Badger&quot; operated as a convoy escort in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Twice she escorted convoys to North Africa (15 October – 28 November 1943 and 15 February – 24 March 1944), and for a brief period (27 June – 1 September 1943) she served as a unit of anti-submarine hunter-killer groups, Task Groups 21.12 and 21.16.

In October 1944, &quot;Badger&quot; transited the Panama Canal and conducted anti submarine training in the Gulf of Panama off Balboa, Panama Canal Zone. Between 15 November 1944 and 20 June 1945, &quot;Badger&quot; served with the Anti-Submarine Development Detachment, Port Everglades, Florida, conducting anti-submarine warfare development exercises.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Badger&quot; arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 22 June 1945 and was decommissioned on 20 July 1945. She was sold on 30 November 1945 for scrapping.

==Awards==
* American Defense Service Medal
* European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service
* World War II Victory Medal

&quot;Badger&quot; received her battle star while operating with Task Group 21.12 in 1943.

<doc id="1073321" wikidata="Q2153905" url="?curid=1073321" title="Child Okeford">
<text>Child Okeford (sometimes written Childe Okeford) is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, east of the small town of Sturminster Newton. Child Okeford lies downstream from Sturminster, along the River Stour, which passes half a mile west of the village. In the 2021 census the civil parish had a population of 1,170.

==History==

On Hambledon Hill to the east of the village are a Neolithic ceremonial burial site and an Iron Age hill fort. The latter has multiple ramparts enclosing and is rich in occupation remains. It occupies the entire northern spur of the hill above and has been described as &quot;one of the most impressive earthworks in southern England&quot;.

In the Domesday Book of 1086 Child Okeford was recorded as &quot;Acford&quot; and appears in two entries. It had 39 households and a total taxable value of 10 geld units. By 1227 the village was known as &quot;Childacford&quot;. The village&#x27;s name derives from the Old English &quot;cild&quot;, meaning a noble-born son, plus &quot;ac&quot; and &quot;ford&quot;, also Old English, meaning an oak-tree ford. The noble-born son likely referred to an early owner.

In 1645 Hambledon Hill was the site of a battle in the English Civil War; a group of locals, who were antagonistic to the war and called themselves &quot;the Clubmen&quot;, attacked both Royalist and Parliamentarian forces and petitioned them to end the war. Under the leadership of the rector of nearby Compton Abbas, 2,000 of them assembled on the hill and defied Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s requests to lay down their arms. Cromwell sent in troops and defeated them, then locked up 300 prisoners in the church at Iwerne Courtney and extracted promises of good behaviour. Cromwell wrote of them as being &quot;poor silly creatures&quot; who &quot;promise to be very dutiful for time to come&quot;. A century later General James Wolfe used the hill&#x27;s steeper sides to prepare his troops; they later surprised the French at Quebec by scaling the Plains of Abraham under cover of darkness.

A World War I war memorial in the form of a stone cross stands at the road junction known in the village as The Cross.

The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ran to the west of the village through neighbouring Shillingstone railway station, until the line closed in 1966.

==Geography==

Child Okeford parish covers at an elevation of about , though the major part is below about . The underlying geology is Kimmeridge clay, upper and lower greensand, gault, some chalk in the east and river gravels by the River Stour.

==Demography==

==Governance==
Child Okeford is in the Dorset unitary authority area. For elections to Dorset Council it is in the Hill Forts and Upper Tarrants electoral ward. The parish was previously part of Sturminster Rural District from 1894 to 1974, and then part of North Dorset district from 1974 until the creation of the unitary Dorset district in 2019.

==Amenities==

Child Okeford has a village hall, community centre, playing field (including a football pitch and cricket pitch), doctor&#x27;s surgery, post office and general store, Church of England primary school, and a nursery or educational support centre for children age 0–11 years. 

==Notable residents==

In 1561 William Kethe was appointed vicar of the parish. He remained in the village until his death in 1594. Kethe wrote the hymns &quot;O worship the King, all glorious above&quot; and &quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot;, the latter adapted from Psalm 100 and set to the tune of The Old Hundredth. Other well known people who live or lived in the village include: the composer Sir John Tavener, who lived in the village until his death in 2013; TV presenter Harry Corbett, originator of Sooty and Sweep, who lived here until his death in 1989; TV presenter Mick Robertson, known for &quot;Magpie&quot;; and politician David James, who lived in the village whilst Conservative MP for North Dorset.

Both the names Thaya and Dyje have their origin in the Illyrian word &#x27;duja&#x27;, which can be translated as &#x27;rushing river&#x27;. The first written mention of Thaya is from 985, when the name was written as &quot;Taja&quot;.

==Characteristic==

From a water management point of view, the Thaya and German Thaya are two different rivers with separate numbering of river kilometres. From a broader point of view, the Thaya (as German Thaya) originates in the territory of Schweiggers at an elevation of and flows to Lanžhot, where it enters the Morava River at an elevation of . The confluence of the Thaya and Morava is the southernmost and the lowest point of Moravia.

The Thaya is long, of which (including the Austrian-Czech state border) is in the Czech Republic, making it the seventh longest river in the country. Its drainage basin has an area of , of which is in the Czech Republic. The name Thaya is used from the confluence of the German Thaya with the Moravian Thaya in Raabs an der Thaya and from this point to the confluence with the Morava, the river is long. 

The Thaya has 573 tributaries. The sources and longest tributaries of the Thaya are:
Notable indirect right tributaries are the streams Včelínek (length: 27.2 km) and Daníž (length: 25.5 km), which flow to the artificial canals of the Thaya.

==Settlements==

The most populated settlements on the river are the towns of Znojmo and Břeclav. The river flows through or along the following municipalities: Raabs an der Thaya, Ludweis-Aigen, Japons, Drosendorf-Zissersdorf, Vratěnín, Stálky, Uherčice, Podhradí nad Dyjí, Oslnovice, Starý Petřín, Bítov, Chvalatice, Lančov, Vranov nad Dyjí, Horní Břečkov, Hardegg, Lukov, Podmolí, Havraníky, Znojmo, Dobšice, Dyje, Tasovice, Krhovice, Strachotice, Slup, Valtrovice, Křídlůvky, Jaroslavice, Hrádek, Dyjákovice, Laa an der Thaya, Hevlín, Hrabětice, Hrušovany nad Jevišovkou, Wildendürnbach, Jevišovka, Drnholec, Brod nad Dyjí, Dolní Dunajovice, Pasohlávky, Dolní Věstonice, Pavlov, Milovice, Přítluky, Bulhary, Lednice, Podivín, Ladná, Břeclav, Bernhardsthal, Rabensburg, Hohenau an der March and Lanžhot.

==Bodies of water==

There are 7,225 bodies of water in the basin area within the Czech Republic. The largest of them are the three Nové Mlýny reservoirs, built directly on the Thaya. Other reservoirs built on the river are the Znojmo and Vranov reservoirs.

==Nature==

The river flows through the Podyjí and Thayatal national parks. Among the protected species that live in the river are the European crayfish and brown trout. The river is also a nesting place for the common kingfisher.

The area of the confluence of the Morava and Thaya, which also includes many pools, oxbow lakes and channels, is the most valuable ichthyological site in the country. About 80% of native Czech fish species can be found there, and 15% of them are endemic, living only there.

==Tourism==
The Thaya is suitable for river tourism. About of the river is navigable, including almost the entire flow in the Czech Republic. The river has enough water throughout the year and belongs to the rivers suitable for less experienced paddlers. The river flows through the tourist-attractive areas of the Podyjí and Thayatal national parks, and through the Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape, which is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

<text>Temple dance denotes a religious performance held in the temples, such as sadir, prescribed by Agamas (scriptures that codified temple rituals, etc.). Traces of these ancient temple dances of India are seen in Bharatanatyam and Odissi.

The sacred Hindu temple dance used to be performed by devadasis and Mahari Dance, who were supposed to manifest in the material body the heavenly dance of apsaras.

<doc id="1073349" wikidata="Q2167772" url="?curid=1073349" title="Rosslare Harbour">
<text>The village of Rosslare Harbour (), also known as Ballygerry, grew up to serve the needs of the harbour of the same name (now called Rosslare Europort), first developed in 1906 by the Great Western Railway and the Great Southern and Western Railway to accommodate steamferry traffic between Great Britain and Ireland. This port also serves France and Spain, traffic is mainly roll-on roll-off (RoRo). Rosslare Harbour railway station opened on 30 August 1906.

==Village==
Although the harbour itself is located close to, and for census purposes is co-terminous with, the village of Ballygeary, and within the townland of Ballygillane Big, it was named after the village of Rosslare, some 4 km away (8 km by road) along the coast. The village of Ballygeary was divided into two townlands, one known as &quot;tin town&quot; and the other as &quot;straw town&quot; or &quot;bamboo town&quot;. It is believed this was because of the roofs on the houses.

The village has a number of guesthouses, hotels, a Roman Catholic church, a post office and some shops, one of which being a Daybreak service station and is regarded as &quot;the heart and soul of Rosslare Harbour&quot; by locals. Just south of the harbour is a small strand leading to &quot;Greenore Point&quot;, where grey seals can sometimes be seen. The harbour is home to an RNLI lifeboat station.

The population of Rosslare Harbour reached 2,247 at the 2022 census, increasing 87% from 2016 and becoming one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the country.

==Railways and ferries==
Services provided by Irish Rail on the Dublin-Rosslare railway line from Rosslare Europort railway station to major places such as Wexford O&#x27;Hanrahan, Enniscorthy, Arklow, Wicklow, Greystones, Bray Daly to Dublin Connolly.

From Dublin Connolly onward rail connections via the Sligo Line links with Longford and Sligo and the Belfast Line links with Drogheda MacBride, Dundalk Clarke, Newry, Portadown and Belfast Grand Central.

==Bus transport==
Rosslare Harbour and Rosslare Europort are served by Bus Éireann routes 40, 132, 370, 379 and 385 and Local Link route 387. The main routes serving Rosslare Harbour are Bus Éireann &quot;Expressway&quot; route 40 which provides several services a day to/from Waterford via New Ross and the 387 to Wexford several times daily. Local route 370 replaces the rail service to Waterford and runs twice a day each way (except Sundays) serving locations in South County Wexford previously served by the railway; Bridgetown, Wellingtonbridge and Campile. &quot;Expressway&quot; route 2 used to link the Harbour with Dublin Airport every hour but was withdrawn in September 2012. There is now only one through bus a week to Dublin – route 132 departing Rosslare Europort on Thursday mornings. It runs cross-country via Carnew.

<text>The first USS &quot;Twiggs&quot; (DD–127) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for Major Levi Twiggs. She was later transferred to the Royal Navy, as HMS &quot;Leamington and to the [[Soviet Navy]] as Zhguchy&quot;, before returning to Britain to star in the film &quot;The Gift Horse&quot;, which depicts the St. Nazaire Raid.

==Service history==

=== United States Navy service ===
&quot;Twiggs&quot; was laid down on 23 January 1918 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. The ship was launched on 28 September 1918; sponsored by Miss Lillie S. Getchell, the granddaughter of Major Twiggs. &quot;Twiggs&quot; was commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 28 July 1919.

Following shakedown, the destroyer joined Destroyer Division 16 (DesDiv 16), Destroyer Squadron 4 (Desron 4), Pacific Fleet, late in October 1919 and operated out of San Diego, California, on training cruises through the spring of 1922. While performing this duty, &quot;Twiggs&quot; was classified DD-127 on 17 July 1920 during the Navy-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers. A combination of factors—increased operating costs, manpower shortages, and the general anti-military climate which followed World War I—resulted in a reduction of the Navy&#x27;s active Fleet. Accordingly, &quot;Twiggs&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 24 June 1922.

After almost eight years of inactivity, &quot;Twiggs&quot; was placed in commission again on 20 February 1930 at San Diego. She became flagship of DesDiv 14 and conducted operations out of San Diego with the Battle Fleet until late in the year. Early in February 1931, she headed south from San Francisco with the Battle Fleet to participate in the annual Fleet concentration with the Scouting Fleet. At the end of the exercises on 15 March 1931, &quot;Twiggs&quot; was reassigned to the Scouting Fleet, soon to be redesignated the Scouting Force as a result of the Fleet Reorganization of on 1 April 1931. &quot;Twiggs&quot; new home port was Charleston, South Carolina, whence she operated as flagship of DesDiv 7 until late in the spring of 1933. Sometime between 1 April and on 1 July 1933, she rejoined the Battle Force destroyers on the west coast as a unit of DesDiv 6, DesRon 2. The destroyer was completely active until on 1 November 1933 when she joined Rotating Reserve DesRon 20 at San Diego. She remained there in a caretaker status—with a minimum crew on board—until on 1 July 1934, when she returned to fully active duty with DesDiv 4, DesRon 2. She operated out of San Diego with the Battle Force destroyers until late in 1936 when she began preparations for decommissioning. On 6 April 1937, &quot;Twiggs&quot; was placed out of commission and berthed at San Diego once again.

Towards the end of the destroyer&#x27;s sojourn in San Diego&#x27;s &quot;red lead row&quot;, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. To augment the &quot;Neutrality Patrol&quot; which President Franklin Roosevelt had placed around the eastern seaboard and Gulf ports, the Navy quickly set the wheels in motion to recommission 77 destroyers and light minelayers which had been in reserve at either Philadelphia or San Diego. As part of this operation, &quot;Twiggs&quot; was recommissioned at San Diego on 30 September 1939, Cdr. Lyman K. Swenson in command.

As flagship for DesDiv 64, DesRon 32, &quot;Twiggs&quot; initially operated out of San Diego on shakedown and training cruises through November. In company with eight of her sister ships, she transited the Panama Canal early in December. Soon after reaching her new base at Key West, Florida, &quot;Twiggs&quot; got underway to shadow the British destroyer . Later in the month, she joined sister ship and the heavy cruiser in keeping a close watch on the Australian light cruiser as she prowled the Gulf of Yucatan on the alert to intercept the German liner which was attempting to slip through the Royal Navy to safety in Germany. The Americans maintained such a close surveillance of the Australian ship that her exasperated commander—Captain &quot;Fearless Freddie&quot; Farncomb—was heard to remark: &quot;Queer idea of &#x27;neutrality&#x27; these Americans have!&quot;

During her subsequent operations with DesDiv 64, &quot;Twiggs&quot; conducted neutrality patrols, training cruises for Naval Reserve contingents, battle practices, and exercises through the summer of 1940.

Meanwhile, by the spring of 1940, the Allied cause had taken a decided turn for the worse, as Norway fell after a disastrous British-Norwegian defense, and France and the Low Countries crumbled under the German &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;. In addition, German submarines—preying upon the convoys in the Atlantic which served as England&#x27;s lifeline—began taking heavy tolls on both the cargo ships and their escorts. After the fall of France, Britain found herself very much alone in her struggle to prevent German hegemony in Europe.

With British destroyer forces in bad shape (the beatings taken in Norway, in the Atlantic convoy lanes, and in the Dunkirk evacuation had cut deeply into the Royal Navy list of escort ships), Prime Minister Winston Churchill appealed to the U.S. for aid. By the summer of 1940, President Roosevelt hit upon a solution to the problems respectively facing the U.S. and Britain. Accordingly, he and the Prime Minister reached the Destroyers for Bases Agreement; in exchange for transferring 50 World War I-era destroyers to the British, the U.S. would gain 99-year leases on strategic base sites in the Western Hemisphere.

As the summer of 1940 gave way to fall, &quot;Twiggs&quot; began preparation for her transfer to Britain. She arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia—the turnover point for the &quot;50 ships that saved the world&quot;—on 16 October 1940. The destroyer was decommissioned on 23 October, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1941.

=== Royal Navy service ===
Turned over to the Royal Navy on 23 October 1940, the flush-decker became HMS &quot;Leamington&quot;, with the pennant number G 19, and Cdr. W. E. Banks, DSO, in command. She shifted to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, whence she departed on 4 November as part of the 4th &quot;Town&quot; Flotilla, bound for the British Isles. &quot;En route&quot; to Belfast, Northern Ireland, she and her sister ships passed through the scene of the action fought on 5 November 1940 by the armed merchant cruiser , in defense of the homeward-bound Convoy HX 84, against the German pocket battleship . &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;″s gallant delaying action enabled 32 of the 37 ships in the convoy to escape, although she herself was sunk in the action. &quot;Leamington&quot; searched for survivors but could find no signs of life.

&quot;Leamington&quot; arrived at Devonport Dockyard, on 15 November, where she was refitted for Royal Navy service. After workup and training, the destroyer was allocated to the 2nd Escort Group, Western Approaches Command, based at Londonderry Port. She conducted convoy escort missions across the Atlantic into 1941. On 28 April 1941, &quot;Leamington&quot; was one of three escorts detached from Convoy OB 314 to reinforce Convoy HX 121, under attack by German U-boats. When the corvette detected a submarine on her sonar, &quot;Leamington&quot; and sister ship joined &quot;Gladiolus&quot; in attacking the contact. Although &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was credited with sinking the submarine, post-war analysis showed that the submarine, was undamaged. On 27 May 1941, &quot;Leamington&quot; was part of the escort of Convoy OB 325 when she collided with the Norwegian merchant ship , which sank, killing five aboard the merchant ship. &quot;Leamington&quot; was under repair at Liverpool until July that year, when she rejoined the 2nd Escort Group, which moved to Iceland in September. On 11 September, the 2nd Escort Group, including &quot;Leamington&quot; was sent to reinforce Convoy SC 42 under heavy attack off the east coast of Greenland from the U-boats of the wolfpack &quot;Markgraf&quot;, which had sunk 15 ships from the convoy already. On the afternoon of 11 September, &quot;Leamington&quot; and the destroyer were sent ahead of the convoy to investigate a sighting by an aircraft of a submarine ahead of the Convoy. The two destroyers spotted on the surface and carried out a series of depth charge attacks against the submarine, which was destroyed with no survivors.

On 23 March 1942, the fast troop convoy WS 17 set out from the United Kingdom to Freetown, Sierra Leone, with &quot;Leamington&quot; part of the convoy&#x27;s escort. On 27 March 1942, the German submarine sighted the convoy, and radioed a sighting report with the hope that other U-boats could be directed to attack the convoy. The destroyer picked up the transmission, and used High-frequency direction finding (HF/DF) to direct an attack against the German submarine by &quot;Leamington&quot;, , and . They attacked and sunk &quot;U-587&quot; with depth charges, the first submarine sunk with the aid of shipboard HF/DF. On 27 June Convoy PQ 17 set out from Iceland for Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union, with &quot;Leamington&quot; joining the convoy&#x27;s close escort on 30 June. On 4 July, believing that the German battleship and other heavy ships had sortied against the convoy, the British First Sea Lord, Admiral Dudley Pound ordered that the convoy be scattered, with the escort, including &quot;Leamington&quot;, being withdrawn to the west. This exposed the lone, unescorted ships to continued unopposed attacks by German U-boats and aircraft. In total, PQ 17 lost 24 of 36 merchant ships, with 21 sunk after the order to scatter.

&quot;Leamington&quot; was refitted at Hartlepool, England, between July and November 1942. On 12 November, the Panamian registry merchantman SS &quot;Buchanan&quot; was torpedoed by . Thirteen days later, &quot;Leamington&quot;—assisted by aircraft—located one of the freighter&#x27;s four lifeboats and took aboard its 17 uninjured sailors.

=== Royal Canadian Navy service ===

In November 1942, the Royal Navy transferred &quot;Leamington&quot; to the Royal Canadian Navy, joining the Western Local Escort Force, escorting convoys from New York and Halifax, Nova Scotia to off Newfoundland, where the convoys were handed over to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force. She experienced extremely bad weather, with extensive icing conditions, while operating in the North Atlantic in late 1942 and early 1943. At one point, the ship reached Halifax after a severe gale on 22 January 1943, coated from bridge to forecastle deck with ice varying from thick.

In April 1943, &quot;Leamington&quot; collided with the American minesweeper and was under repair at Halifax until 3 June. Later that month, she collided with the merchant ship &quot;Mortimer&quot; and was repaired at Norfolk, Virginia with work continuing until October 1943.

=== Soviet Navy service ===
Departing Halifax on 22 December, &quot;Leamington&quot; returned to the British Isles and reverted to Royal Navy control. After a period of service based at Rosyth, Scotland, &quot;Leamington&quot; was placed in reserve at the Tyne. However, on 16 June 1944, the British loaned the ship to the Russians, who renamed her Zhguchy (rus. Жгучий, &quot;Fiery&quot;). She served under the Russian flag through 1949 and was returned to Great Britain in 1950, when she starred in the Trevor Howard film &quot;Gift Horse&quot; as the fictional &quot;HMS &quot;Ballantrae&quot;&quot;, (ex- &quot;USS &quot;Whittier&quot;&quot;) which depicted the St Nazaire Raid. She was subsequently sold to John Cashmore Ltd and broken up for scrap at Newport, Wales on 26 July 1951.

<text>The Sixes Mine is a group of former gold placer mines in the Georgia Gold Belt. They are near Sixes in Cherokee County, Georgia, United States, located off Bell&#x27;s Ferry Road, south of Canton, Georgia.

==History==
The Sixes Mine was originally worked by the Cherokee and was located near the Cherokee town called Sixes. It may have been in operation as early as 1819 and would therefore predate the Georgia Gold Rush. The discovery of six gold mines was the reason why the Cherokee Nation was forced off their land. The Trail of Tears march began in Cherokee County approximately from where Sixes Mine is located. After the Cherokee Nation was driven off their land, the Georgia Land Lottery of 1832 took place, which granted plots of land to Georgia residents who were fortunate enough to win the lottery. One such winner was Mrs. Mary G. Franklin, founder of the Franklin-Creighton Mine. 

The six mines that comprised the Sixes are the

* Three Hundred and One,
* Cherokee, Clarkston,
* Downing Creek Placer Mine,
* Macou Project,
* Putnam Mine.

==Current status==

The Sixes mine and Downing Creek Placer mines were both located in what is now the BridgeMill planned community. The Downing Creek Placer mine is located on private property on Downing Creek Court. 

The Three Hundred and One mine was located on county plat 301, 15th district.

The Cherokee Mine is located off Wooten Drive on Army Corps of Engineers property. Public access is difficult, and there is no easy approach. The mine can be accessed by boat on Allatoona Lake up Sixes Creek, or by foot into the Corps property tree line marked by red blazes on the trees across from the BridgeMill neighborhood swimming pool. Visiting and gold panning is allowed by the Corps, but only panning with shovels and pans in the stream bed.

<text>Church Knowle is a village and civil parish on the Isle of Purbeck in the county of Dorset in the south of England.

Church Knowle village is situated about west of Corfe Castle, south of Wareham and west of Swanage. In the 2011 census the parish—which includes the settlements of East Creech and Furzebrook to the north—had 114 households and a population of 261.

The church is named Saint Peter&#x27;s Church. Church Knowle Fete is held in the grounds of the Old Rectory every August.

==Pike family==
Buried in the Churchyard at Church Knowle are the two brothers who brought the first steam locomotive (Primus) to Purbeck in 1866 - The Pike Brothers - John William and William Joseph Pike (Purbeck Ball Clay Merchants). They are buried together with their relatives. John is buried with his mother-in-law Charlotte Bridges Mayer, who was the daughter of William Adams of London and wife of the potter Thomas Mayer. John lived at Westport House in Wareham, now the site of the home of Purbeck District Council. William Joseph lived in North Street Wareham. William Joseph&#x27;s 7-year-old son was drowned in Studland Bay and is buried alongside his father. John and William Joseph&#x27;s clay merchant father - William lived nearby at Bucknowle House and it was here that the Pike Brothers were born. William Pike&#x27;s father-in-law was Jacob Warburton who founded the New Hall Pottery in Staffordshire and also leased Bucknowle Farm when he retired to be close to his daughters, Ann and Catherine. Catherine had married local land owner William Voss.

Warburton Pike was born at Church Knowle and was another son of William Pike. He was educated at University College London and went on to the Middle Temple where he was certified as a Special Pleader. In 1879 Pike published &quot;Translations from Dante, Petrarch, Michael Angelo and Vittoria Colonna&quot; and went on to be the first person to translate Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; into English in 1881. Although he died in Highgate, he is buried alongside his family in St. Peter&#x27;s graveyard.

==1945 Air Disaster== 
On 15 June 1945 a Royal Air Force, Consolidated Liberator C Mk IX (JT985) crashed in the village of Kingston near Church Knowle while on a flight from RAF Holmsley South to Palam, Delhi India via RAF Castel Benito, Libya. The aircraft had low fuel pressure and attempted to return to RAF Holmsley in bad weather. All 27 onboard the aircraft died in the crash.

<doc id="1073394" wikidata="Q2376308" url="?curid=1073394" title="Clifton Maybank">
<text>Clifton Maybank is a hamlet and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It is located about a mile southwest of the village of Bradford Abbas. It is known for Clifton Maybank House, a country house with surviving Tudor fabric. Dorset County Council estimate that the population of the parish in 2013 was 40.

==Clifton Maybank settlement==
Clifton Maybank is recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Clistone&quot;, held by William Malbank, a tenant of Hugh, Earl of Chester in 1086, and it is from Malbank that the &#x27;Maybank&#x27; suffix derives. 

Writing in 1811, Samuel Lewis stated that the village had 60 inhabitants and that the church at Clifton Maybank had &quot;been in ruins for a century&quot;.

==Clifton Maybank GWR railway station==
On 13 June 1864 a new line was opened from the GWR Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth line up to a new Clifton Maybank goods station located on the south side of the LSWR Yeovil Junction railway station. The GWR was, until 1874, a 7 ft (2,134 mm) broad gauge line and broad and standard gauge wagons could be brought alongside each other at Clifton Maybank to allow goods to be transhipped between them.

The transfer shed used for transhipping goods and approximately ¼ mile of track along the Clifton Maybank spur are now part of the Yeovil Railway Centre, where steam trains named the Clifton Maybank Rambler are being run in 2019.

==Clifton Maybank House==
Once site of an ancient chapelry dependent of nearby Yetminster, the early history of the house of Clifton Maybank (sometimes named Clifton Maubank or Clifton House) is obscure. Remaining are several structures, some of which were formerly interconnected, and part of which (called by Rogers, a screen) was removed to nearby Montacute House.

The Horsey family of Horsey near Bridgwater in Somerset held properties in and around Clifton Maybank during the fifteenth century. When John Horsey (1479–1531) died, he was buried at Yetminster parish church, near Clifton Maybank. His son, Sir John Horsey substantially increased the family&#x27;s wealth and power. Little is known of the Horsey family house at Clifton Maybank at this time, but it is known that the poet Sir Thomas Wyatt died while staying at the house in 1542. Sir John died four years later in 1546. Soon after this his oldest son, Sir John Horsey, made Clifton Maybank his principal residence and began a major and expensive rebuilding process on the house, using the local Ham stone. It has been described as &quot;one of the most spectacular of the group of contemporary houses in the district, which included Barrington, Melbury, and Montacute.&quot; The Horsey family fortunes entered a period of slow decline, and in 1786 much of the house was dismantled and sold – one main front of the building being transferred to Montacute House and the early 17th century lodge was removed in 1800 to Hinton St George.

After decline in the 18th century the buildings became a working farm, but were then restored in the late 19th – early 20th century. The house itself was reconditioned in 1906-7 with additions on the north and east sides. The present house is thought to have been the east wing of the original building, of which the main block extended to the west from the middle of the existing wing. The south front of the present house is original and was formerly of two storeys with attics (as was the front transferred to Montacute). The door in the modern porch incorporates some late 16th-century woodwork. The west front may have been redesigned after the 1786 demolitions, but the central gable has a reset oriel window with Tudor roses and horses&#x27; heads (for Horsey). An early 16th-century detached building to the southeast has also been remodelled: it originally extended further northwards. No depiction of the original building is known. The house was the country home of the art historian Professor Michael Jaffé.

There is archaeological evidence of the pre-1650 landscape in the grounds of Clifton Maybank House.

Clifton Maybank House is Grade I listed and the gardens are also of note, although they are not listed on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.

<doc id="1073399" wikidata="Q5547503" url="?curid=1073399" title="Georgia Gold Belt">
<text>The largest quantities of gold found in the eastern United States were found in the Georgia Gold Belt, extending from eastern Alabama to Rabun County, Georgia. The biggest concentration of gold was found in White, Lumpkin, and northern Cherokee counties in Georgia. The gold in the Georgia Gold Belt was close to 24 karat (100%) purity. Most of the gold was found in eroded rock (saprolite) and mixed in with quartz.

Besides placer deposits of gold, and gold bearing quartz in weathered rock, gold also occurs in quartz veins. The most profitable veins, in the Dahlonega District, occur in the contact zone between mica-schists and granite or diorite.

The discovery of gold in the Georgia Gold Belt in 1828 led to the Georgia Gold Rush. The historic cities of Auraria and Dahlonega were the primary beneficiaries of the gold discovery, and a branch mint of the United States Mint was operated in Dahlonega until 1861. The Georgia Gold Belt is part of a zone of gold deposits in the southeast United States that runs from Alabama to Virginia. Smaller gold deposits can be found farther north.

<doc id="1073400" wikidata="Q5142966" url="?curid=1073400" title="Colehill">
<text>Colehill is a parish neighbouring Wimborne Minster, in Dorset, England. It had a population of 7,000 in 2001, which decreased to 6,927 people at the 2011 census.

==History==
The name Colehill originated in 1431 as Colhulle, becoming Colhill in 1518 and Collehill in 1547, later getting the simplified spelling of Colehill, but the origins of Colehill as a settlement predate this by a long way.

Six round barrows, which can still be seen, show that people lived here as early as 2000 BC. The River Stour would have been navigable; there is evidence that in about 500 BC, peoples from Continental Europe were populating the South West, bringing the culture of the early Iron Age. Fortifications at Hengistbury Head and more forts inland were established then.

Part of the tracks survive, running parallel to the river from the coastal fort through modern locations such as Parley and Stapehill to Badbury Rings. It is thought that the line of Middlehill Road derives from one of these very early tracks.

Later in Roman times Wimborne developed as an important trading centre on the River Stour, and as a junction for further tracks from Poole to Badbury Rings and on to Salisbury. Another track radiating eastward possibly set the line for what was to become in modern times the A31. Bridges replaced the fords (Canford) in about 100 AD.

There then followed the Saxon invasion and the formation of the Kingdom of Wessex. Agriculture became established and with it clearance of some small plots on the sunny heathland slopes around Colehill. Over the centuries farms grew until, with the impetus of inclosure acts (1750 to 1860), they were consolidated into the estates that we know of today – Kingston Lacy, Hanham and Uddens estates.

==Colehill today==

There are two first schools in Colehill, (Colehill First School and Hayeswood First School), a primary school (St Catherine&#x27;s RC Primary School &amp; Kindergarten), a middle school (St Michael&#x27;s) and a foundation school (Beaucroft Foundation School (SEND)).

There is also a private school (Dumpton&#x27;s). The main public hall is Colehill Memorial Hall, and nearby is the community library which was re-opened in February 2013. It is run by volunteers with some support from the then Dorset County Council and its successor council, Dorset Council. Colehill has a pharmacy, a hairdressers, and three post offices and convenience stores.

A parish plan for Colehill was published in 2008. Many of the planned actions have been implemented, including the community library mentioned above. A website was published in November 2008; it is updated regularly and all local organisations are encouraged to contribute. Colehill appears on Twitter and Facebook.

Traffic calming in Middlehill Road has been introduced and the major roundabout on the A31 at Canford Bottom has been re-engineered. A parish initiative succeeded in rebuilding the Reef as a youth and community centre for the people of Colehill and Wimborne. Over £500K was raised locally and assistance given by East Dorset District Council. The building was completed in 2016 and is fully in use with the activities continuing to expand.

There are a few houses in Colehill dating from the 1860s and rapid expansion took place in the 20th century. The population rose from 1786 in 1951 to 5370 in 1971. Several large estates of modern family homes were built and there is quite a lot of infill building. The Parish Church, Church of England, is &quot;St Michaels and All Angels&quot;.

It was designed by Caröe in 1893 and is a half brick and half timber construction in the Arts and Crafts style. Nearby and close to the war memorial at the centre of the village are the Triangle Woods which have village green status. There are areas of common land, a recreation ground at Oliver&#x27;s Park, and a Local Nature Reserve at Leigh Common. The area is well wooded and the local Forestry Commission plantation at Cannon Hill is very popular for walking.

The District Council&#x27;s Core Strategy, approved in 2013, placed over half of East Dorset&#x27;s New Neighbourhood development in Colehill; it comprises 630 homes along the Cranborne Road and 350 south of the Leigh Road A31.

As of 2014 a significant part of Colehill (including the New Neighbourhoods) was designated as a parish ward of Wimborne. In part compensation areas of Stapehill, west of the Canford Bottom roundabout, were transferred from Ferndown to the Colehill parish ward.

==Notable people==

* Tim Berners Lee- World Wide Web creator
* Micheal Medwin- Actor
* Roger Johnson- Footballer
* Al Stewart- Musician

==Politics==
There are three electoral wards within the parish (Colehill East, Colehill Hayes &amp; Colehill West). In the new unitary Dorset Council (May 2019) these wards were joined with the Wimborne Minster East electoral ward to form a two-member electoral division (Colehill &amp; Wimborne Minster East).

Colehill became part of the Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency at the 2010 general election.

<text>No. 14 Squadron of the Royal Air Force currently operates the Beechcraft Shadow R1 (a modified Beechcraft Super King Air) in the Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) role from RAF Waddington.

==History==

===First World War===
No. 14 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed on 3 February 1915 at Shoreham with Maurice Farman S.11 and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 aircraft. After a few months of training at Hounslow and Fort Grange, Gosport it departed for the Middle East in November of that same year for Army co-operation duties during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. In 1916 the squadron&#x27;s B.E.2s were supplemented with a small number of Airco DH.1A two seat fighters for escort duties, with the type remaining in use until March 1917. Other fighters operated by the squadron&#x27;s fighter flight included the Bristol Scout and Vickers F.B.19, but the fighter flight left the squadron in August 1917 to form No. 111 Squadron. The squadron flew in support of British forces in the Third Battle of Gaza in late 1917. In November 1917 the squadron was equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8s, which were used to perform reconnaissance duties, attacking the Turkish Seventh Army as it retreated following the Battle of Nablus. It was recalled to the UK in January 1919 and disbanded the following month.

====Squadron motto====

The Squadron motto—&quot;I spread my wings and keep my promise&quot;—is believed by many, including the RAF, to be an extract from the Koran as suggested to the RAF by the Emir of Transjordan but in Arabic, this is not quite as depicted on the Squadron badge. The nickname of the squadron was &quot;Crusaders&quot;, which reflected the Crusader motif on the squadron&#x27;s badge. This nickname was dropped in 2024 after a complaint from within the service of the connotations of the Crusaders in regards to the Muslims that they fought.

===Between the wars===
On 1 February 1920 the squadron was reformed in Ramleh by renumbering No. 111 Squadron. The squadron operated Bristol Fighters and used them for various duties including photo surveying and air policing. The squadron patrolled Trans-Jordan and Palestine for the next 20 years and it was during this period that the squadron gained its Arabic motto. Airco DH.9A bombers supplemented the squadron&#x27;s Bristol fighters in June 1924, using them to attack and together with RAF-operated armoured cars help defeat a several-thousand strong raiding force of Ikhwan tribesmen at Umm el Amad, south of Amman in Jordan in August that year. The squadron fully equipped with DH.9As in January 1926. Fairey IIIFs replaced the squadron&#x27;s DH.9As in November 1929, using them on reconnaissance duties during civil unrest in Palestine. The Fairey Gordon, a radial engined derivative of the IIIF re-equipped the squadron in September 1932, being used for operations against Arab rioters during the 1933 Palestine riots. In March 1938, the squadron replaced its Gordons with Vickers Wellesley monoplane bombers.

===Second World War===
When the Second World War broke out the squadron was transferred to Egypt but soon returned to Amman. In May 1940, with the likelihood of war between Britain and Italy increasing rapidly, 14 Squadron was ordered to move to Port Sudan to reinforce the weak RAF forces in East Africa facing Italian forces in Ethiopia and Eritrea. On 10 June, Italy declared war on Britain and France, and on the night of 11/12 June 14 Squadron flew its first offensive mission of the Second World War, when nine Wellesleys bombed fuel storage tanks and the airfield at Massawa. It lost its first Wellesley to Italian defences on 14 June during a second raid against Massawa. The squadron received a single Supermarine Walrus from 47 Squadron which was used for patrols over the Red Sea in July 1940, while the squadron&#x27;s Wellesleys continued bombing missions against Italian targets. The Squadron started to receive twin-engined Bristol Blenheims in September that year, flying its first Blenheim mission on 20 September, and flying its final Wellesley sortie on 20 November. In March 1941 it carried out bombing raids in support of the assault on Keren.
In April 1941, following the liberation of Addis Ababa, the squadron was sent to Egypt for operations over the Western Desert. The squadron was deployed in support of Operation Brevity on 15–16 May 1941, an unsuccessful British offensive, and carried out attacks on German and Italian motor transport, with five Blenheims being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters of III &quot;Gruppe&quot;, &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 27 while carrying out strafing attacks along the Tobruk–Capuzzo road on 21 May. The squadron flew attacks against Maleme Airfield on 25 and 27 May during the Battle of Crete, and in June, flew in support of Operation Battleaxe, another unsuccessful British offensive in the Western Desert. On 7 July 1941, the squadron withdrew from the Western Desert, being based in Palestine and Iraq until it returned to Egypt in November 1941.
On 17 August 1942, 14 Squadron was withdrawn from operations to convert to the Martin Marauder, the first RAF Squadron to operate this American bomber. The squadron flew its first operational mission with the Marauder, a maritime reconnaissance mission on 26 October 1942. The squadron used its Marauders for long-range maritime reconnaissance missions, minelaying and anti-shipping attack with torpedoes over the Aegean. The squadron&#x27;s Marauders sank a tanker with torpedoes on 19 January 1943 and two more merchant ships on 21 February. In March 1943, it started performing anti-submarine missions and long-range maritime reconnaissance missions, finding targets to be attacked by other anti-shipping units, operating out of Blida and then Maison Blanche in Algeria. In May 1943 the squadron supplemented its Marauders by six ex-USAAF P-51A Mustangs on loan, which equipped an additional flight for offensive operations, but these were returned to the USAAF in July, the squadron continuing to operate the Marauder. It operated detachments in Italy and Sardinia, moving completely to Alghero in Sardinia in June 1944. In July 1944, the squadron began to operate maritime patrol operations in conjunction with the Bristol Beaufighters of 39 Squadron, with a Marauder cruising offshore and directing Beaufighters to attack any shipping spotted. The squadron flew its last Marauder mission on 21 September that year, leaving its equipment behind when it transferred back to the UK.

The squadron operated within RAF Coastal Command from 24 October 1944. On its return to the UK, the squadron was based at RAF Chivenor and carried out anti-submarine mission over the Western Approaches and the Bay of Biscay using Vickers Wellington Mk.XIVs. The squadron was again disbanded on 1 June 1945 but was reborn the same day, when 143 Squadron at RAF Banff, equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito Mk.VI in the anti-shipping strike role, was renumbered. This incarnation of the squadron was short lived, being disbanded on 31 March 1946.

===With RAF Germany===
Disbandment did not last long however, the following day No. 128 Squadron, operating Mosquito B.16s at RAF Wahn in Germany, was renumbered No.14 squadron and the squadron lived again. In December 1947 the Mosquito B.16s were replaced with the Mosquito B.35 variant. The squadron moved to RAF Celle in September 1949, but this was a short placement as they moved again in November 1950, this time to RAF Fassberg. In 1951 the squadron received de Havilland Vampire FB.5s to replace the Mosquitos, while in 1953 the Vampires made place for de Havilland Venom FB.1s.
The squadron converted to the day-fighter role when it received Hawker Hunter F.4s in 1955 while based at RAF Oldenburg, where they stayed for two years before moving to RAF Ahlhorn. The squadron used the Hunters until 17 December 1962, when the unit was disbanded at RAF Gutersloh. The same day however No. 88 Squadron was renumbered No.14 Squadron, flying English Electric Canberra B(I).8s from RAF Wildenrath.

On 30 June 1970 the squadron was reformed at RAF Bruggen and operated McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR.2s until April 1975, when they were replaced with the SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1. From 1976 their role at RAF Bruggen, assigned to SACEUR, was support of the army in a European land battle, first in a conventional role, and later in a nuclear delivery role should tactical nuclear weapons be used. The squadron&#x27;s twelve Jaguars were expected by RAF planning staff to suffer attrition of one third their strength, leaving sufficient survivors to deliver their stockpile of eight WE.177 nuclear bombs. From 1986 the squadron&#x27;s twelve Jaguars were exchanged for twelve Tornado GR.1s, for use in a similar role. Tornados were able to carry two WE.177 nuclear bombs, and the RAF staff expected that there would be enough survivors of the conventional war phase to deliver an increased stock of eighteen bombs. The squadron&#x27;s role operating WE.177 nuclear bombs was programmed to remain in place until the mid 1990s.

In August 1990, the squadron was dispatched to Bahrain in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as part of Operation Granby along with two other squadrons from Bruggen, no. 9 and no. 31 Squadrons.

===Iraq and Afghanistan===
The squadron returned to the UK from Germany in January 2001. It operated from RAF Lossiemouth, as the Tornado GR4 Force squadron specialising in Low Level TIALD, night electro-optical low level and operational low flying. It participated in Operation Resinate (South), flying sorties from Ali Al Salem AB, Kuwait until January 2003. The squadron returned to Ali Al Salem in August 2003 as part of Operation TELIC (phase 4). In September 2003, the 6 Tornado&#x27;s took off from Ali Al Salem for the last time and started flying operational missions over Iraq and landing at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

Four crews from the squadron took part in the first detachment of Tornado GR Force personnel to Operation HERRICK in summer 2009. 14 Squadron carried out its only autonomous detachment to Kandahar between November 2010 and February 2011, flying day and night in support of ISAF forces across Afghanistan. The squadron mounted ground alert as well as flying numerous planned recce sorties using the RAPTOR pod, and CAS sorties equipped with Paveway IV 500 lb bombs and Dual Mode Seeker MBDA Brimstone missiles.
After its return to the UK in 2011, it was announced that the squadron would be disbanded as one of the two Tornado squadrons due to cease operations as part of the 2010 SDSR along with XIII Squadron based at RAF Marham.

The squadron ceased operations in March 2011, and, after a formal review by the Duke of York, was formally disbanded on 1 June 2011. Squadron Leader Eric Aldrovandi, a Burmese Python, who had served as the regimental mascot and had been with the squadron since its re-equipment with the Tornado in 1985, took the opportunity to retire and was transferred to Amazonia, a visitor attraction at Strathclyde Country Park.

===Reformation===
The Squadron was re-formed on 14 October 2011 at RAF Waddington operating the Beechcraft Shadow R1 in a Tactical ISR support role, an activity which had previously been operated as a Flight under V(AC) Squadron.

From September 2014, the squadron temporarily relocated to Coningsby along with V(AC) Squadron due to the resurfacing of RAF Waddington&#x27;s runway which took over a year to complete. It was announced in 2017 that the Squadron&#x27;s fleet of five Shadow R1 would be increased by three and further upgrades would be funded.

<doc id="1073405" wikidata="Q286794" url="?curid=1073405" title="Salakta">
<text>Salakta is a small Tunisian village situated by the sea.

Salakta has been occupied or ruled by many civilisations, including the Phoenicians, Byzantines, Romans, and Muslim Oubéidines. The attractions include a beach, catacombs, an ancient cemetery and a museum. It is in Salakta that the mosaics &quot;Lion&quot; (with huge proportions, and which is displayed in the Bardo National Museum) was found.

Though not an established name in Tunisian tourism, Salakta is nevertheless one of the oldest historical sites in the country. Most of this is now under the sea, unfortunately.
Its population swells from few hundreds to few thousands in summer when most of its people come back from Europe or from other Tunisian regions in order to spend summer.

==Description==
Salakta is a village in the Sahel, Tunisia located five kilometers from Ksour Essef. (35°24&#x27;N, 11°03&#x27;E) Its name is derived from the Latin Sullecthum ( &quot;blessed place&quot; ) because of the beauty of its beach.

The village is attached to the delegation of Ksour Essef in the Mahdia Governorate, it had a population of 3,477 in 2004.

==History==

The town was a port exporting wheat, and later of olive oils, and wines.
The fishing port was successively occupied by the Phoenicians, the Byzantines, the Romans and then the Arabs. 
The village was a privileged place for the Byzantines under Justinian who used it as a strategic point for their conquests. Belisarius&#x27;s invasion of Africa began during the Vandalic War in 533, not far from Salakta on the Caput Vada.

During the Second World War, both the French Army and the German Afrika Korps maintained a military base here.

==Archaeological remains==

Salakta is one of the oldest historical sites in the country. It features a small museum set within the site of the ancient site. However, the majority of the latter is under the sea.

One of the main mosaics of the Bardo National Museum, representing an African lion, was discovered in Salakta in 1958. In Roman times, Salakta was an important commercial port under the name of Syllectum or Sullectum. One of the offices of the Place des Corporations in Ostia bears the name of the navicularii of Syllectum, and oil amphorae with the original mark A SYLL have been found in Ostia and Salakta, Archaeological evidence of a trade of active oil between Salakta and Rome.

==Tourism==
The beaches, the catacombs, an ancient cemetery, as well as the archaeological museum founded in 1980, are worth visiting. The museum shows excavation finds from the surrounding area, in particular terracotta as well as a large mosaic of a Berberlöwen. The mosaic has a height of about 3 meters and dates from the 3rd century. There are necropolises of the megalithic culture in the surroundings.

Although Salakta is not particularly important for tourism from abroad, it is still one of the oldest historical sites in the country. Most of the ancient settlement is now below the sea level. The population of Salakta developed not least due to the tourism and attractiveness of the beaches of few hundred people to several thousand today.

==Bishopric==
Sullectum was the seat of a bishopric during the Roman Empire but this moved to near modern Mahdia in the Middle Ages. The ancient bishopric was re-established in name in the 20th century as a titular bishopric, with the current bishop being Ulrich Boom of Würzburg.

<doc id="1073407" wikidata="Q3520964" url="?curid=1073407" title="Karan Thapar">
<text>Karan Thapar (born 5 November 1955) is an Indian journalist, news presenter and interviewer working with The Wire. Thapar was associated with CNN-IBN and hosted &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; and &quot;The Last Word&quot;. Some of the celebrities he has interviewed include Narendra Modi and Shah Rukh Khan. He was also associated with India Today, hosted the shows &quot;To the Point&quot; and &quot;Nothing But The Truth&quot; and is doing an exclusive series of Interviews with &quot;The Wire&quot; on his show the Interview with Karan Thapar.

==Early life and education==

Karan Thapar is the youngest child of former Chief of the Army Staff General Pran Nath Thapar and Bimla Thapar. The late journalist Romesh Thapar was his cousin and Thapar is also a cousin to historian Romila Thapar.

Thapar is also related distantly to the family of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru&#x27;s niece, the writer Nayantara Sahgal, was married to Gautam Sahgal, brother of Bimla Thapar, his mother.

He is an alumnus of The Doon School in Dehradun and Stowe School in England. While at Doon, Thapar was the editor-in-chief of the school magazine &quot;The Doon School Weekly&quot;. 

Thapar graduated with a degree in Economics and Political Philosophy from Pembroke College, Cambridge University in 1977. In the same year, he was also President of the Cambridge Union. After which he obtained a doctorate in International Relations from St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford University.

==Career==
He began his career in journalism with &quot;The Times&quot; in Lagos, Nigeria and later worked as their Lead Writer on the Indian subcontinent till 1981. In 1982 he joined &quot;London Weekend Television&quot; in the United Kingdom where he worked for the next 11 years. In London he was one of the co-presenters of Eastern Eye magazine program for South Asian minorities in UK. He moved to India in 1991 and worked with &quot;The Hindustan Times Television Group&quot;, &quot;Home TV&quot; and &quot;United Television&quot; before setting up his own production house in August 2001, Infotainment Television, which makes programmes for amongst others BBC, Miroshka, Doordarshan and Channel News Asia. 

Thapar is noted for his aggressive interviews with leading politicians and celebrities. A few of his shows which have been much watched are &quot;Eyewitness&quot;, &quot;Tonight at 10&quot;, &quot;In Focus with Karan&quot;, &quot;Line of Fire&quot;, &quot;War of Words&quot; &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; and &quot;The Last Word&quot;. In 2004, Thapar famously interviewed late former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, J. Jayalalithaa. It ended with Jayalalithaa snapping at him and tossing the mic on the table, saying that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t a pleasure talking to you&quot; and chose to leave with a &quot;Namaste&quot; not responding to his handshake. In 2007, Thapar also famously interviewed current Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (then the Chief Minister of Gujarat). A few minutes after the interview started, Thapar asked a few questions regarding the Modi administrations&#x27; actions during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Modi abruptly stopped the interview just three minutes in while saying &quot;dosti bani rahe&quot; (Hindustani for &quot;Let the friendship be intact&quot;) which became a popular internet meme. He later said that interviewing A. R. Rahman was the toughest in his career due to Rahman&#x27;s shy nature.

In 2020–21, Thapar wrote a column &quot;As I see it&quot; in the daily newspaper &quot;The Asian Age&quot;. In August 2021, the management of &quot;The Asian Age&quot; objected to Thapar&#x27;s regular column after he wrote about the &#x27;1947 Violence Against Jammu Muslims&#x27;. The violence against the Muslim residents of Jammu during the partition led to their mass displacement from the Jammu region. Thapar stopped writing for the column and said &quot;The 1947 violence against Jammu&#x27;s Muslims that unfolded over a period of three-four months in 1947 is well-documented and has been historically accounted for. It is something that no one can contest. So I gather that the owners are under enormous pressure, presumably from Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah.&quot;

As of 2021, he is doing the regular show &quot;The Interview with Karan Thapar&quot; after joining &quot;The Wire&quot;.

<text>Compton Abbas is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England. It lies south of the town of Shaftesbury. It is sited on greensand strata on the edge of the Blackmore Vale, below the chalk downs of Cranborne Chase. On top of these hills is Compton Abbas Airfield. The A350 road between Wiltshire and the south coast passes through the village. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 216. The name &quot;Compton Abbas&quot; derives from the Saxon &quot;cumb-ton&quot;, meaning &#x27;village in a narrow valley&#x27;, plus &quot;abbas&quot; which refers to Shaftesbury Abbey (the land was owned by the abbess). The church, St. Mary&#x27;s, was built in 1866 to replace the older structure which was more remote from the village.

== Places of interest ==
The tower of the Church of St Mary in East Compton is a Grade I listed building.

== Politics ==
Compton Abbas is part of the North Dorset constituency for elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Compton Abbas is part of the Beacon ward for elections to Dorset Council.

<doc id="1073414" wikidata="Q211328" url="?curid=1073414" title="Great Morava">
<text>The Great Morava (, ) is the final section of the Morava (), a major river system in Serbia.

== Etymology ==
According to Predrag Komatina from the Institute for Byzantine Studies in Belgrade, the Great Morava is named after the Merehani, an early Slavic tribe who were still unconquered by the Bulgars during the time of the Bavarian Geographer. However, after 845, the Bulgars added these Slavs to their &quot;societas&quot; (they are last mentioned in 853).

== Length ==
The Great Morava begins at the confluence of the South Morava and the West Morava, located near the village of Stalać, a major railway junction in Central Serbia. From there to its confluence with the Danube northeast of the city of Smederevo, the Velika Morava is 185 km long. With its longer branch, the West Morava, it is 493 km long. The South Morava, which represents the natural headwaters of the Morava, used to be longer than the West Morava, but due to the regulations of river bed and melioration, it is shorter nowadays.

At one time (regulations were made on all three branches making them shorter) the Morava was over 600 km long. Today, the most distant water source in the Morava watershed is the source of the Ibar River, the right and longest tributary of the Zapadna Morava, originating in Montenegro, which gives the Ibar-West Morava-Great Morava river system a length of 550 km, which still makes it the longest waterway in the Balkan Peninsula.

== Geography ==
The drainage basin of the Velika Morava is 6,126 km2, and of the whole Morava system is 38,207 km2 (of that, 1,237 km2 are in Bulgaria and 44 km2 are in the Republic of Macedonia). This drainage basin covers 42,38% the area of Serbia. Velika Morava flows through the most fertile and densely populated area of Central Serbia, called the Morava river valley or Pomoravlje. Pomoravlje was formed in a fossil bay of a vast, ancient Pannonian Sea which dried out 200,000 years ago. Through about half of its length it passes through beautiful Bagrdan gorge (Bagrdanska klisura). In past centuries, it was known for its seemingly endless forests, but there is almost nothing left today of those old woods. It flows into the Danube between the villages of Kulič &amp; Dubravica, in the coal mining basin of Kostolac, one of two major mines in its drainage basin (the other one being Resava coal basin, in valley of the Velika Morava&#x27;s right tributary Resava). The average discharge of the Velika Morava on its confluence with Danube is 255 m3/s (120 m3/s brought by Zapadna Morava, 100 m3/s by Južna Morava, and 35 m3/s amounted by the Velika Morava itself).

== Tributaries ==

Tributaries of the Velika Morava are short, the longest one being the Jasenica (79 km) and others rarely exceeding 50 km. Right tributaries are: Jovanovačka reka, Crnica, Ravanica, Resava and Resavica (or Resavčina). Left tributaries are more numerous, including: Kalenićka reka, Lugomir, Belica River, Lepenica, Rača, and Jasenica. Many of them don&#x27;t carry much water, but in rainy years, they are known for causing major floods, which has been a big problem for the entire Morava river system. Before it meets the Danube, the Velika Morava splits, creating a 47 km long arm called the Jezava, which flows into the Danube separately, in the town of Smederevo. It is joined by a longer (51 km) river, the Ralja, from the left.

==Improvements==
The Velika Morava represents a textbook example of a meandering river. It used to be 245 km long, but directly from its origin to the Danube, the distance is only 118 km; its meandering ratio is 118:245, one of the highest in Europe.

The riverbed is 80–200 m wide, and the depth as much as 10 m. Notorious for its flooding, the Morava has changed its course many times, and old river bends have become small lakes, known as &quot;moravište&quot;. Južna Morava, with extremely high erosion in its drainage basin, brings huge amounts of silt which is elevating Velika Morava&#x27;s river bed, making floods even more frequent.

Beginning in 1966, huge works began on all three rivers to prevent future floodings. Series of reservoirs were made on tributaries (lakes Bovan, Ćelije, and others) and meanders were cut through, making river courses straightened, which made them shorter (in the case of the Velika Morava, from 245 to 185 km). It was projected that it would shorten by as much as 152 km, and that it would become navigable again.

The Morava and its tributaries still flood often, so its bed remains elevated, despite dozens of gravel-digging companies in cities and villages near the river&#x27;s upper course (Lozovik, Lugavčina, Lučica, Velika Plana, etc.).

==Navigation==

Today, Velika Morava is navigable for only 3 km from its mouth. In the past it was navigable all the way to the city of Ćuprija, for about 3/4 of its length. But, as mentioned before, Velika Morava gets buried under the materials brought by the Južna Morava.

When the melioration program began in 1966, it was projected it would become navigable again, in the first phase to Ćuprija, and in the next all the way to Stalać, making it 100% navigable. None of this was accomplished. From time to time, the idea of digging a Morava-Vardar Canal is proposed, which would connect a Danube-Morava-Vardar-Aegean Sea route.

Technical problems of making this waterway would be enormous (neither the Morava nor the Vardar are navigable), the usefulness of its creation is debatable (whether the route would be used much), and the estimated costs are deemed prohibitive.

==Settlements==

Although Morava valley has always been the most populous part of Serbia, disastrous floodings prevented people from settling on the river banks itself. The only urban settlement on the river banks is Ćuprija, but it often suffers from floods (including several times in the 1990s).

Other urban settlements, built a little further away from the river itself, include: Paraćin, Jagodina, Batočina, Lapovo, Svilajnac, Velika Plana, Požarevac and Smederevo. Smaller places and villages include: Varvarin, Glogovac, Markovac, Veliko Orašje, Miloševac and Lozovik.

==Tradition==

The Romans called it &quot;Margus&quot; (in addition to that, the Zapadna Morava was named &quot;Brongus&quot;, and Južna Morava was &quot;Angrus&quot;). The modern-day city of Ćuprija existed in Roman times as &quot;Horreum Margi&quot; (meaning &quot;The Granary of Margus&quot;).

In Serbian history, its valley became the cradle of the modern Serbian state in the beginning of the 19th century (so called &quot;Moravian Serbia&quot;; Moravska Srbija). Many songs were written in celebration of Morava and its fertility, but most of them also talked about casualties and damages done by the river during floods.

Songs are even made today about it; the most famous are: &quot;Oj Moravo&quot; (&quot;Oh, Morava&quot;), &quot;Moravo, tija reko&quot; (&quot;Morava, you quiet river&quot;), &quot;Uz Moravu vetar duva&quot; (&quot;Wind blows up the Morava&quot;), &quot;Na Moravi vodenica stara&quot; (&quot;Old mill on Morava&quot;), &quot;Moravac kolo&quot; (&quot;Morava kolo&quot;), etc.

&quot;Oj Moravo&quot; may be the most characteristic:

:&#x27;Oj Moravo, moje selo ravno,
:Kad si ravno što si vodoplavno

:Kiša pade, te Morava dođe,
:Te poplavi moje selo ravno

:A u selu Jovanove dvore,
:I u dvoru Jovanovu ljubu&#x27;

:&quot;Oh, Morava, my plain village,&quot;
:&quot;If it&#x27;s so plain, why do you flood it&quot;

:&quot;Rains came, so Morava rose,&quot;
:&quot;And flooded my plain village&quot;

:&quot;And in the village it flooded Jovan&#x27;s home,&quot;
:&quot;And in it, his loving wife&quot;&#x27;

<text>Compton Valence is a small village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It lies approximately west of the county town Dorchester. It is sited at the head of a narrow valley, formed by a small tributary of the River Frome, and is surrounded by the hills of the Dorset Downs, which has led to it having been described as &quot;a pocket of habitation in the downs.&quot; Dorset County Council estimate that in 2013 the population of the parish was 50.

The parish church has a 15th-century tower, but the rest of the building was rebuilt in 1838–1839 by Benjamin Ferrey. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

The locality is known to geologists for the &#x27;Compton Valence Dome&#x27;, arising from the local upcoming of the chalk strata. The core of this geological structure has been eroded to reveal the older underlying Middle Jurassic mudstones. It lies astride the Wynford Fault and is thought to arise from a complex intersection of faults in the area.

Compton Valence is known locally for its display of snowdrops, which fill the road verges in late winter.

<text>Joliette () is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1935 and since 1968.

==Geography==
This electoral district, located northeast of Montreal in the Quebec region of Lanaudière, currently consists of:
*the Regional County Municipality of Matawinie, including Communauté Atikamekw de Manawan indian reserve
*the Regional County Municipality of Joliette.

It is bounded by the:
* electoral district of Repentigny and Berthier—Maskinongé and the Saint Lawrence River to the south
* electoral district of Saint-Maurice—Champlain to the east and north
* Lac Nemiscachingue and the electoral districts of Rivière-du-Nord, Montcalm and Laurentides—Labelle to the west

== Demographics ==
&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 93.4% White, 3.8% Indigenous, 1.1% Black

Languages: 92.5% French, 2.1% English, 1.8% Atikamekw

Religions: 70.0% Christian (63.5% Catholic, 6.5% Other), 28.4% None

Median income: $37,200 (2020)

Average income: $45,280 (2020)

==History==
It was created by the British North America Act of 1867 which preserved existing electoral districts in Lower Canada. In 1933, Joliette became part of the new electoral district of Joliette—L&#x27;Assomption—Montcalm.

It was created again in 1966 from Berthier—Maskinongé—delanaudière, Joliette—L&#x27;Assomption—Montcalm and Terrebonne ridings.

This riding lost territory to Berthier—Maskinongé during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will largely be replaced by Joliette—Manawan. It loses the municipalities of Saint-Donat and Notre-Dame-de-la-Merci to Laurentides—Labelle; loses Entrelacs and Chertsey to Les Pays-d&#x27;en-Haut; and gains the Domaine-Ouellet area from Repentigny.

<text>&quot;Ohne dich&quot; ( &quot;Without You&quot;) is a song by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released on 22 November 2004 as the third single from their fourth studio album, &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; (2004).

==Composition==
&quot;Ohne dich&quot; can be seen as expressing mourning over the loss of a loved person. It follows a slow, even romantic ballad style. The central motif is &quot;Without you, I cannot be..., With you, I am alone also...&quot;. This song also features how death is not just mourning but a bond between the people that are there at the funeral. It&#x27;s not all about death, it&#x27;s about the remembrance of this person and how they brought everyone closer.

The visuals play off what are called Heimatfilms and the reference to the birds no longer singing (&quot;Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr&quot;) could refer also to the Wandervogel with a nostalgic feeling of loss of the freedom they embodied, which was manifested with ballads and nature wandering.

==Live story==
The song debuted live in its beta version in 2000, in a concert just for members of the fan club. After that, it was dropped during the 2001–02 Mutter tour.
It returned to the setlists for the 2004–05 Reise, Reise tour, in which it was played in almost every concert, exceptions being festivals. Usually, sparks would rain over Till Lindemann during the final chorus.
In those of the live shows that Apocalyptica was the support act, they played the cellos in the song. The song wasn&#x27;t played in the &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; tour, but it reappeared for the Made In Germany 1995–2011 tour, Download festival 2013 and the European Stadium Tour 2019.

==Video==
The video was filmed in the Kaun Valley and on the Großglockner in Austria. It shows the band climbing in the mountains when lead vocalist Till Lindemann falls and gets badly hurt. In the night, while the band sits in the tent, Lindemann looks longingly out of the tent up to the mountain&#x27;s peak as gangrene eats away at his injured leg. The band members eat and rest while bassist Oliver Riedel engraves their names on a pan&#x27;s lid to leave as a testimony of their presence on the mountain, as others have done. The next day, the band starts to climb the mountain again, carrying Lindemann. In the end, they reach the mountain peak; Lindemann takes a look around and dies satisfied.

<text>Number 15 Squadron, sometimes written as No. XV Squadron, was a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It most recently operated the Panavia Tornado GR4 from RAF Lossiemouth as No. XV (Reserve) Squadron. It was the RAF&#x27;s Operational Conversion Unit for the Tornado GR4 which taught pilots and Weapon Systems Officers (WSO) how to fly the aircraft and what tactics to use to best exploit the performance of their aircraft and its weapons.

==History==

===World War I===
No. 15 Squadron was first formed at Farnborough Airfield on 1 March 1915 as a Royal Flying Corps training unit, commanded by Major Philip Joubert de la Ferté. It was mainly equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2cs, supplemented with a few Bristol Scouts, and moved to France on 22 December 1915, undertaking a reconnaissance role in support of the Army. It operated in support of IV Corps during the Battle of the Somme in summer 1916, suffering heavy losses from both ground fire and German fighter aircraft. It was praised by Douglas Haig for its work in support of the Fifth Army in the Ancre salient in January 1917.

It was again heavily committed to action in support of the offensive at Arras in spring 1917. It re-equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in June 1917, retaining the &quot;Harry Tate&quot; (a rhyming-slang term for the aircraft) until the end of the First World War. The squadron was based at La Gorgue in northern France from 7 July until 18 August 2017.

For the great tank attack at the Battle of Cambrai (November–December 2017), No.15 Squadron was specially tasked with checking the camouflaging of the troops, guns and dumps assembled before the attack.

The squadron moved back to the United Kingdom in February 1919, and was disbanded at Fowlmere on 31 December that year.

One of the officers who began his career in the squadron during this era was future Air Marshal Sir Charles Steele.

===Interwar 1919–1939===
It reformed on 20 March 1924 at Martlesham Heath as part of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, mainly carrying out test flying of bomber aircraft. No. 15 was again reformed in 1934 at RAF Abingdon as a light bomber squadron equipped with the Hawker Hart. Its Commanding Officer of the day, Squadron Leader T W Elmhirst, DFC, instigated the squadron&#x27;s tradition of writing its squadron number in Roman numerals. It received Hawker Hinds as a temporary replacement for the Harts before re-equipping with Fairey Battle monoplanes in 1938.

===World War II===

Still equipped with Fairey Battle light bombers, the squadron flew to France in September 1939 as part of No. 71 Wing, Advanced Air Striking Force. It departed from RAF Abingdon circa 2 September. After returning to the UK, the following year it re-equipped first with Bristol Blenheims and again with Vickers Wellingtons before becoming one of the first Short Stirling bomber squadrons. One famous Stirling was donated by Lady MacRobert in memory of her three sons killed in RAF service and named &quot;MacRobert&#x27;s Reply&quot;.

In 1943, the squadron converted to Avro Lancasters and was based at RAF Mildenhall. In mid-1945 the squadron was involved in Operation mana dropping food to Dutch civilians and later in repatriation flights for returning allied POWs.

===Cold War service===
In 1947, the Lancasters were replaced with Avro Lincolns, before the squadron adopted the nuclear strike role with Boeing Washingtons in 1951.

No. XV Squadron re-equipped with the English Electric Canberra B.2 bomber in June 1953, whilst at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, later moving to RAF Cottesmore, Rutland and then to RAF Honington, Suffolk. The Canberra was used in combat in the Suez Crisis and dropped the most bombs in the eighteen days of conflict. The Squadron disbanded on 15 April 1957.

On 1 September 1958, it was reformed as the second Handley Page Victor squadron, stationed at RAF Cottesmore. In 1962, it was one of the many squadrons ready for action during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Deploying to RAF Tengah in 1963, it was on hand as a show of force to deter Indonesia during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. Following this, it was disbanded on 31 October 1964 upon withdrawal from overseas detachment. It was then intended to be reformed with the BAC TSR-2 and then the General Dynamics F-111K, but with both acquisitions cancelled, these plans were not carried out.

===Service as a nuclear force===

In 1970, the Squadron was finally reformed with the Blackburn Buccaneer S.2B at RAF Honington, shortly afterwards moving to RAF Laarbruch in Germany. From 1971 their task at RAF Laarbruch, assigned to SACEUR, was the support of the army in a European land battle, first in a conventional role, and later in a tactical nuclear delivery role, if required. RAF planning staff expected the squadron&#x27;s twelve Buccaneer S2B aircraft to suffer attrition of one third their strength, leaving sufficient survivors, with those held back in reserve from the conventional phase, to deliver the squadron&#x27;s allocation of eighteen WE.177 nuclear bombs.

In 1983, the squadron exchanged their twelve Buccaneer S2s for the same number of Tornado GR.1s, for use in a similar role from early 1984. Because of the UK&#x27;s commitment to SACEUR, this involved the use of the &quot;Designate&quot; process whereby a Tornado squadron was formed and worked up at Honington and once operational moved to Laarbruch and assumed the No.15 Squadron identity from the Buccaneer unit. This made the squadron the first Tornado unit in Germany - a force that would grow to eight squadrons - and remained in the nuclear delivery role for SACEUR with an increased allocation of 18 weapons owing to the Tornado&#x27;s ability to carry two bombs. The squadron&#x27;s nuclear delivery role assigned to SACEUR continued at this strength until 1991, when it disbanded.

===Desert Storm onwards===

Deployed to Bahrain during the build-up to Operation Desert Storm, the Squadron was given the specific brief to knock out Iraqi Air Force bases by bombing the runways. On its second mission, an ultra-low-level daylight mission against Ar Rumaylah airfield with Squadron Leader Pablo Mason leading a flight of four Tornados, his number two crew of John Peters and navigator John Nichol were shot down and became POWs. Mason (along with many other RAF tornado crews) flew a total of 24 bombing missions in Desert Storm, from ultra-low-level daylight, medium-level night bombing and, on 2 February 1991, the first-ever Buccaneer/Tornado attack using laser-guided bombs. During the conflict (14 February), another aircraft crewed by XV Squadron personnel was shot down, resulting in the loss of Flt Lt Stephen Hicks and the capture of Flt Lt Rupert Clark.

In 1992 No.45 (Reserve) Squadron, the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit based at RAF Honington changed its &quot;shadow&quot; identity to No.15 (Reserve) Squadron, remaining at RAF Honington until 1993 assigned to SACEUR in the role it had performed when based at RAF Laarbruch. The squadron&#x27;s equipment of twenty-six aircraft and thirty-nine WE.177 nuclear bombs was unusually large. Relocation to RAF Lossiemouth in 1994 brought reassignment to SACLANT in the maritime strike role, armed with a variety of conventional weapons and eighteen WE.177 nuclear bombs. After the closure of the Cottesmore-based Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment (TTTE) in 1999, 15(R) Squadron assumed responsibility for both conversion to the Tornado and weapons training.

The squadron disbanded on 31 March 2017 in preparation for the retirement of the Tornado GR4 in 2019. The squadron aircraft and crews will be absorbed into front-line squadrons at RAF Marham who will carry out refresher training when required. The squadron completed its final operational flying on 17 March 2017.

<text>Coombe Keynes is a hamlet, civil parish and depopulated village in the Purbeck district of Dorset, England. The village is about south of Wool and about west-south-west of Wareham.

In 2013 the population of the civil parish was estimated to be 80. There are 22 houses in the hamlet and 37 properties in the parish as a whole.

==History==
Coombe Keynes was part of Winfrith Hundred. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Cume, held by Gilbert de Magminot, Bishop of Lisieux. The name Keynes derives from the later Lords of the Manor, the de Cahaignes family, who also held Tarrant Keyneston.

Later Coombe Keynes&#x27; population declined until it is now only a hamlet. The lost part of the settlement was immediately east of the parish church. The area is now a field what appear to be platforms where cottages stood and a hollow way that would have been a lane. This depopulated area is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

The Church of England parish church of the Holy Rood was formerly the centre of a large parish that included the village of Wool. In 1844 Wool was made into a separate parish. The two ecclesiastical parishes were recombined in 1967.

The chancel arch and west tower of Holy Rood church is 13th-century. The rest of the church was rebuilt in 1860–61 to designs by Thomas Hicks. It is a Gothic Revival building with nave, chancel and north porch. It was deconsecrated in 1974 and is now used as a secular function room managed by the Coombe Keynes Trust.

The Coombe Keynes Chalice, a rare pre-Reformation chalice with an octagonal foot with embellished angles on the stem, is now kept in the Dorset Museum.

<text>USS &quot;DeLong&quot; (DD-129) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;DeLong&quot;, named for Lieutenant Commander George W. DeLong (1844–1881), an Arctic explorer, was launched 29 October 1918 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Miss E. DeL. Mills, granddaughter of Lt. Cmdr. DeLong; and commissioned 20 September 1919. &quot;DeLong&quot; sailed from New York 3 November 1919, and after joining in exercises at Guantanamo Bay, and patrolling off Honduras arrived at San Diego 24 December. She sailed in maneuvers and torpedo practice off Coronado Roads until placed in reserve 20 June 1920. After extended overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, she returned to San Diego 26 June 1921 and began operating from that port 21 October with 50 percent of her complement. On 1 December 1921 she went aground in a heavy fog at Half Moon Bay. A tug and two destroyers, &quot;Badger&quot; (DD-126) and &quot;Ballard&quot; (DD-267), stood by to assist. On 17 December she was salvaged and towed to Mare Island Navy Yard. &quot;DeLong&quot; was decommissioned 18 March 1922 and her hulk sold 25 September 1922.

<text>Crossways is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It lies east of the county town Dorchester. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 2,267.

In the early 1930s Crossways was a hamlet of scattered bungalows and cottages. At that time the Air Ministry acquired local heath and farmland to build an airfield. This airfield was completed in 1937 and was known briefly as RAF Woodsford, although it was renamed RAF Warmwell a year later. RAF Warmwell played an important part in World War II, being a major fighter station during the Battle of Britain, and offering fighter protection for Portland Naval Base and other important south coast areas. The village has been used for filming on many occasions.

During the following years, the runways and operational areas disappeared as a result of the extraction of valuable sand and gravel by mineral companies, however the influence of the airfield can still be seen today. The village hall used to have a multi-functional role, being used by the airmen for recreational use - cinema, gymnasium and NAAFI - but also was used on occasions as a morgue. It is in use constantly to this day. Much of the present village of Crossways is built on the eastern part of the former airfield site.

In the early 1970s the local government authority for the area decided to build blocks of flats, houses and bungalows at Crossways to provide much-needed accommodation for displaced families in the area, and to fulfill a growing need for housing at the time. This resulted in a very rapid expansion in the size of the community. There is a thriving business park nearby and a new school opened in September 2006.

<doc id="1073448" wikidata="Q5306535" url="?curid=1073448" title="Dreamcake">
<text>Dreamcake is the first album by the Halifax, Nova Scotia, band Jale. It was released in 1994 on Sub Pop Records.

The only Jale album with the singer-songwriter-drummer Alyson McLeod, the songs on &quot;Dreamcake&quot; are considered edgier and more emotional than those of Jale&#x27;s later work.

The closing track, &quot;Promise&quot;, written by Jennifer Pierce and Patrick Pentland of Sloan, and sung by Pierce, was released as a single.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote that the album &quot;displays a precocious craft that lifts [Jale] well above one-trick-pony status.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot; called &quot;Dreamcake&quot; one of the ten best Canadian-made Sub Pop records, writing that &quot;hypnotic Halifax pop swirls between the speakers on &#x27;Again,&#x27; while &#x27;Mend&#x27; threads together elements of jangling twee and paisley-print psychedelia.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;with a bit less aggression than Hole and less cutesy-ness than Shonen Knife, [Jale] incorporate just enough guitar noise to counterbalance all those delightful pop hooks.&quot;

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote: &quot;A diverse collection of contemporary electric indie-pop styles (some audibly influenced by Sloan) from a palette of appealing melodies, gentle harmony singing and buzzing guitar power, the casual-sounding record articulates the longings and frustrations of mindful young women who know when to draw the line and walk away from a bad scene.&quot;

<text>The Enns () is a southern tributary of the river Danube in Austria, joining northward at the city of Enns. It forms much of the border between the states of Lower Austria and Upper Austria. The Enns spans , in a flat-J-shape. It flows from its source near the village Flachau, generally eastward through Radstadt, Schladming, and Liezen, then turns north near Hieflau, to flow past Weyer and Ternberg through Steyr, and further north to the Danube at Enns (&quot;see map in References&quot;).

==Name==
It was known in Latin as &quot;Anisus&quot; or &quot;Anasus&quot;, of uncertain origin; Anreiter et al. tried to link it to an Indo-European *&quot;on&quot;- and the hydronymic suffix *&quot;-is-&quot;. Later sources call it &quot;Ensa&quot; or &quot;Enisa&quot;. Others have linked it to Upper Danubian Vasconic *&quot;an&quot;, &quot;water.&quot; Another possible link is Greek ᾰ̓νῠστός (&quot;anystos&quot;, &quot;useful&quot;). The West Slavic languages have different names for the river: in Czech it is called the &quot;Enže&quot;; in Slovak, the &quot;Enža&quot;; and in Polish, the &quot;Aniza&quot;.

== Geography ==
The Enns has its source in the Radstädter Tauern mountains in the Austrian state of Salzburg. In a valley which developed during the ice age, it flows at the border between the Northern Limestone Alps and the Central Eastern Alps on an eastern trajectory through Styria, where it passes the Dachstein group at its southern side. Between Admont and Hieflau, it takes a turn to the North and passes through the Gesäuse, a gorge of a length of , where it penetrates the limestone of the Ennstaler Alpen. Flowing to the north from there on, it reaches the state of Upper Austria at the mouth of the . North of Steyr, it forms the border between Upper Austria and Lower Austria (formerly also known as &quot;Austria above the Enns&quot; and &quot;Austria below the Enns&quot;). Finally, it meets the Danube at Mauthausen and the city of Enns. It is the longest river solely in Austria.

The Enns is a typical wild water river and draws its water from an area of , which makes it the fifth-largest in Austria. Its average discharge at the mouth is .

The Anisian Age in the Triassic Period of geological time is named from Anisus, the Latin name of the river Enns.

== History ==
In the middle of the 19th century, canals began to be built along the between Weißenbach and the Gesäuse, in order to make use of the water for agriculture and forestry.

In total, ten power plants with a total generative power of 345 megawatts have been built by the &quot;Ennskraftwerke AG&quot;.

== Towns along the river ==

== Hydroelectric power stations ==
Currently, there are 15 hydroelectric power stations on the Enns. The power stations are listed beginning at the headwaters:

== Tributaries ==
The most important inflows are the Palten, the Salza and the Steyr. Other tributaries are the Northern Taurach and the Erzbach.

== Transport ==
A major transit route connecting Germany and Slovenia through Austria runs through the Enns valley.
The so-called (&quot;iron road&quot;) runs along the river between Hieflau and Enns, along which iron ore has been transported from the Styrian Erzberg (&quot;ore mountain&quot;) to the steel mill in Linz. The 263km Enns Radweg cyclepath follows the river starting at Flachauwinkl and finishing where the Enns enters the Danube.

<text>Dewlish is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, and is situated approximately north-east of the county town Dorchester. The village is sited in the valley of the small Devil&#x27;s Brook among the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs; the parish covers about and extends west to include part of the valley of the small Cheselbourne stream, and east to include a dry valley at Dennet&#x27;s Bottom. The surrounding area is part of the Dorset National Landscape area. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 284.

Dewlish was also the main part of the Liberty of the same name, including Dewlish itself and a part of Milborne St Andrew.

==Dewlish House==
One of the most significant properties in the area, Dewlish House was built in 1702. It served as the childhood home of John Michel (who later became a field marshal) from 1804 to 1823 and later served as his retirement home between 1880 and 1886. Recently owned by Mr and Mrs Anthony Boyden (from 1962 to 2020) the Grade I-listed Queen Anne style house and its property were sold in 2020. The buyer was an American already living in the UK.

==Church of All Saints==

The parish church of All Saints, south of the village, is a Grade II* listed building.The oldest parts of the building are of the 12th century, and it was modified and enlarged in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. There was restoration in 1872 by T. H. Wyatt, when the south aisle was remodelled and an organ chamber was added. In the north aisle is a monument to Sir John Michel (1886).

==History and prehistory==
===Court Close===

To the east and south of the parish church and west of the Devil&#x27;s Brook there are earthworks, the remains of a former settlement. They are a scheduled monument. On the tithe map of 1844 it has the name Court Close. It covers an area of about . Most of it is occupied by a large embanked enclosure, within which there are banks and scarps; its purpose is unknown. In the east there is a small rectangular moat, once probably enclosing a manor house.

===Roman villa===
About 1740 the tessellated pavement of a Roman villa was discovered in the village, near Michel&#x27;s Farm. In 1971 a full excavation began of the site; by 1973, 24 rooms of the villa, including a bath suite, had been revealed. Further excavation established that there were three main settlement areas, dating from the Iron Age, early Roman and late Roman, an occupation period of 400 to 500 years.

In February 2021 it was announced that a mosaic from the Roman villa, discovered in 1974, showing a leopard attacking an antelope, would be displayed in the Dorset County Museum at Dorchester, after £150,000 was raised to buy it. It had been bought at auction in 2018 for an international collector, but export was suspended. Jon Murden, director of the museum, said that the piece was &quot;one of the most significant 4th-century Roman mosaics in the country&quot;.

==Population==

===Mammoths===
In the 19th century the remains of two prehistoric mammoths, dating from about one million years BC, were found in the hillside above the village; two of the tusks were taken to the county museum at Dorchester.

<doc id="1073462" wikidata="Q3397734" url="?curid=1073462" title="Pontiac (federal electoral district)">
<text>Pontiac (formerly known as Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle) is a federal electoral district in western Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1949 and since 1968.

In every election since its creation except 1979 and 2011, Pontiac has been a bellwether electoral district whose electoral winner also was a member of the winning party.

==History==
The electoral district existed over three distinct periods:
*It was created by the British North America Act of 1867 which preserved existing electoral districts in Lower Canada. It was redistributed into the new electoral districts of Pontiac—Témiscamingue and Villeneuve in 1947.
*In 1966, an electoral district of Pontiac was created from Pontiac—Témiscamingue and parts of Gatineau and Labelle. Then, in 1978, it was renamed &quot;Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle&quot;.
*In 2003, the electoral district of Pontiac was created again during a redistribution of the ridings in western Quebec.

Pontiac lost territory to Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation and gained territory from Hull—Aylmer and Gatineau during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will largely be replaced by Pontiac—Kitigan Zibi. The new name refers to the reservation of Kitigan Zibi. It loses Val-des-Monts to Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation; loses that part of the City of Gatineau west of Montée Paiement to the riding of Gatineau; and gains the rest of the Plateau neighbourhood from Hull—Aylmer.

==Geography==
The electoral district includes:
* the regional county municipality of Pontiac
* the Regional County Municipality of La Vallée-de-la-Gatineau, including Rapid Lake and Kitigan Zibi indian reserves
* that part of the City of Gatineau northwest of a line following Montée Paiment to Autoroute 50 to Boulevard la Vérendrye Ouest.
* that part of the City of Gatineau northwest of a line following Promenade de la Gatineau to Boulevard Saint-Raymond to Chemin Pink to Boulevard des Grives to Boulevard des Allumettières to Chemin Eardley
* the regional county municipality of Les Collines-de-l&#x27;Outaouais (excepting L&#x27;Ange-Gardien and Notre-Dame-de-la-Salette)

The neighbouring ridings are Abitibi—Témiscamingue, Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou, Saint-Maurice—Champlain, Laurentides—Labelle, Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation, Hull—Aylmer and Gatineau (in Quebec) and Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, Ottawa—Orléans, Ottawa West—Nepean, Carleton—Mississippi Mills, and Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke (in Ontario).

==Demographics==
&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 80.6% White, 7.9% Indigenous, 5.6% Black, 2.1% Arab, 1.2% Latin American

Languages: 65.1% French, 22.7% English, 1.5% Arabic, 1.2% Spanish

<doc id="1073467" wikidata="Q307712" url="?curid=1073467" title="Abdank coat of arms">
<text>Abdank is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several &quot;szlachta&quot; families in the times of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==Blazoning==
Gules &quot;łękawica&quot; argent, crest: łąkawica as in arms.

==History==

According to Kasper Niesiecki, the beginning of this shield dates from the time of Krakus, a mythological Polish monarch who founded and gave his name to the city of Kraków. On Wawel Mount, where Kraków&#x27;s castle stood, from the Wisła (Vistula) river side, a man-eating dragon showed up. One day a man called Skuba, a young shoemaker, took the skin of a flayed sheep, put tar and sulphur and fire-brand into it and threw it into the dragon&#x27;s lair. The dragon, not recognizing the deception, assumed it was a sacrifice from the people of Kraków and ate the fake sheep. The fire in his belly ignited it and as a result the dragon became very thirsty. He drank and drank the water from the Wisła river until he finally exploded and died. For his heroic deed Krakus granted Skuba the letter &quot;W&quot; to his shield, standing either for &quot;wąż&quot; (snake) or for Wawel. This letter can be seen on the Abdank coat of arms.

The Awdaniec Clan (such as it may be) has been called variously: &quot;Awdaniec,&quot; &quot;Abdaniec,&quot; &quot;Abdanka,&quot; &quot;Awdanc,&quot; &quot;Awdanczyc,&quot; &quot;Habdaniec,&quot; &quot;Habdank,&quot; &quot;Habdaniec,&quot; &quot;Hebdank,&quot; &quot;Lakotka,&quot; &quot;Lekawa,&quot; &quot;Lekawica,&quot; &quot;Lekotka,&quot; &quot;Bialkotka,&quot; &quot;Szczedrzyk,&quot; &quot;Skuba,&quot; and probably other things similar and dissimilar. Known recorded war cries are: &quot;Abdaniec!,&quot; &quot;Abdank!,&quot;&quot;Awdaniec!,&quot; &quot;Habdank!,&quot; and &quot;Hebdank!.&quot;

<text>Korab is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by many &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) families under the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

* Motto of the Korab coat of arms: &quot;Deo Gloria&quot; (&quot;Glory to God&quot;).
* First Mention: 1242 Zbislaw of Korab appointed Voivode of Sieradz
* Second Registry: 1292 from the Seal of Korab.
* Third Registry: 1480s - Revised. &quot;The golden Watchtower within the Ark of Noah was removed from the Seal of Korab and replaced with a Black Mast.
In 1983 the Polish Korab coat of arms was unusually incorporated into a grant of arms by the English College of Arms in London. These new arms included the Ciołek Arms held by the Zelenski (Zileinski) clan which were used as the crest of the Armorial Bearings with the shield of the Korab remaining the same. The two families were united by marriage in 1977. This was an unusual grant of arms and said to have made heraldic history in England.

==Notable bearers==

Notable bearers of this coat of arms have included:

* Zbislaw of Sieradz
* Janisław I, Archbishop of Gniezno
* Jan Łaski (1456–1531), Primate of Poland
* Hieronymus Łaski
* Jakub Zadzik
* Wojciech Chrzanowski (1793-1861), polish general
* Ludomił Rayski
* Jacques Hnizdovsky (1915-1985) — Ukrainian-American painter, printmaker, graphic designer, illustrator and sculptor

<doc id="1073475" wikidata="Q2719899" url="?curid=1073475" title="Catch 'em if You Can">
<text>&quot;Catch &#x27;em if You Can&quot; is the eighteenth episode of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 25, 2004. The episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Matthew Nastuk.

In this episode, Bart and Lisa refuse to accompany Homer and Marge to their uncle&#x27;s birthday, so the parents decide to have a romantic vacation by themselves in Miami instead. When the children learn where they went, they decide to pursue their parents. The episode was well received by critics.

==Plot==
Bart lectures the other students on the bus on the topic of water balloons. After he hits Lisa with one, she fights with him all the way home. Marge stops them after Maggie is accidentally thrown into a box of cat litter and tells the pair that they are going to Ohio to celebrate Uncle Tyrone&#x27;s birthday. Bart and Lisa are saddened with the idea as Tyrone complained last year about why he is still alive. Homer and Marge relent and allow the kids to stay home; but Marge insists they do one family activity together. They all rent a romantic film; Bart and Lisa are unimpressed by it such that they ruin any moment the film might have created for Homer and Marge.

Homer and Marge look forward to their trip without the children as they ruin every possible chance of intimacy for them. At the airport the next day, they see people in another queue, dressed in Hawaiian shirts and skimpy tops, going to Miami. This causes them to reminisce on their less-than-stellar honeymoon at a beach billboard in a run-down area of Springfield. On a whim, they decide to forego visiting Tyrone and get on the plane to Miami as a second honeymoon. As the flight is overbooked, they are upgraded to first-class, much to their delight.

Bart, Lisa and Grampa learn on the news that the hotel in Dayton where Marge and Homer are supposed to be staying has been completely wiped out by a tornado. They suddenly get a call from Marge, informing them that all is well. Suspicious, Bart uses last-call return to find out the last incoming phone number and discovers their parents are in Miami. He and Lisa get Grampa to take them there.

Homer and Marge see the children waiting for them outside their hotel room door, so they run from the ready-to-track-them-down pair, causing Bart and Lisa to summon a hot pursuit of their parents in an instrumental musical montage and an animated sequence. They will not have any trouble paying for their chase, considering Homer has borrowed Ned Flanders&#x27; credit card and Bart has borrowed Rod Flanders&#x27; credit card. Meanwhile, in Miami, Grampa finds companionship with an old man named Raúl who responds by turning his hearing aid off.

Homer and Marge finally find themselves at the Niagara Falls, only to find the children are already there. When Bart and Lisa confront them, they agree to let them mess about in the room, making them even more despondent. The next day, Bart and Lisa, feeling a little guilty, decide to give their parents some space, and go to an amusement park, inadvertently running into Homer and Marge who snuck off for some time alone. Refusing to allow Lisa to explain, an angry Homer and Marge start running away again and find refuge in a giant inflatable castle, which their lovemaking antics cause them to fall into the Niagara River. The Canadian and American rescue teams start to fight over who is to rescue as the couple floats towards the falls and certain death, only to be saved by their large flotation device. They pass by the Maid of the Mist, whose captain asks them if there is anyone alive. Homer and Marge shout they are more alive than any of the boat&#x27;s squares from inside the inflatable castle, as it floats away, and they engage in martial artistic sexual intercourse underneath the falls. Bart and Lisa, watching from a telescope, decide that everything worked out just fine.

Meanwhile, back in Springfield, Ned and Rod Flanders receive their monthly credit card bills and gasp at the charges Homer and Bart have run up.

==Cultural references==

The title of the episode is a reference to the film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, which is also parodied in the musical montage.

When Bart and Lisa arrive in Miami, an excerpt of the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; theme song is heard.

Homer is traveling by air in first class and says &quot;Look at me, I&#x27;m reading &quot;The Economist&quot;. Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?&quot; and when questioned by his wife, he simply replies &quot;It is!&quot; Four days later, &quot;The Economist&quot; indeed had an article about Indonesia referring to the &quot;crossroads&quot;, and mentioned the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode in short weekly commentaries. The title of the issue was &quot;Indonesia&#x27;s Gambit&quot;. About seven months later, &quot;The Economist&quot; ran a cover headline reading &quot;Indonesia at a Crossroads&quot;. The running gag continued with a direct reference on Sept. 22nd, 2013, an indirect one on Oct. 4th 2014, and another direct one on Nov. 20, 2024.

* Drederick Tatum tells Homer and Marge as they roll out of an elevator he is fighting a White Rhino at the Tropicana (a real Atlantic City casino) with shows at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 &amp; Midnight.
* Next to the Lackluster Video (itself a spoof of Blockbuster Video) entrance, there is a sign that reads &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t star Sandra Bullock, your rental is free!&quot;.
* In the same video store, Moe nervously enters the &quot;ADULT FILMS&quot; section in the back, to which Bart follows him in euphoric expectation, only to find out that the private room features arthouse movies from &quot;Merchant-Ivory&quot;, &quot;Truffaut&quot;, &quot;Unfunny Woody Allen&quot;, &quot;Henry Jaglom&quot;, &quot;Bergman&quot;, &quot;Spike &amp; Ang Lee&quot; rather than adult movies. (Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; can be read listed in the &quot;Spike &amp; Ang Lee&quot; section as well as its correct place.)
* There is a &quot;Futurama&quot; poster in the Lackluster video store.
* The song playing on the record player that the two older men are carrying is a re-recorded version of &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; by The Andrews Sisters on Capitol Records.
* The other people at Uncle Tyrone&#x27;s birthday are the Simpsons that Homer gathered in the episode &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot;.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode earned a 3.4 rating and was watched by 9.28 million viewers, which was the 42nd most-watched show that week.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; the episode was &quot;a fairly okay show&quot;. He liked the scene of Grampa trying to seduce old women.

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis did not like the episode, but Brendan Dando related to certain scenes because he was a parent although he thought the writing was &quot;absurd&quot;.

<text>The school UWC Red Cross Nordic (Norwegian: UWC Røde Kors Nordisk), formerly known as Red Cross Nordic United World College, was founded in 1995, located in Norway. It is the ninth member of the today 18 United World Colleges, others having been established in Wales, Canada, Hong Kong, Italy, India, Singapore, Swaziland, United States, Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Germany, Armenia, China, Thailand, Japan, and Tanzania. Patrons of the college and the movement include Nelson Mandela, Queen Noor of Jordan and Queen Sonja of Norway. The first college, UWC Atlantic College, was established by the German educationalist Kurt Hahn to promote international understanding and peace. Students are selected by UWC National Committees or selection contacts in over 150 countries on merit and many receive full scholarships. After the two-year education following the guidelines of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program students usually go on to higher education. UWC students are eligible to participate in the Shelby Davis Scholarship program, which funds undergraduate studies (based on need) for UWC students at many US universities. The school is led by the Rektor, Pelham Lindfield Roberts, Deputy Rektor, Natasha Lambert and the Board of Governors, currently chaired by Elizabeth Sellevold.

==Location and facilities==

UWCRCN is located on the remote shores of Flekke in the community of Fjaler, Sogn og Fjordane County, Western Coastal, Norway at approximately . The college enrolls 200 students aged 16 to 20 from more than 80 different nations, including teenagers from SOS Children&#x27;s Villages and refugees. The College not only focuses on academics, but also seeks to find a balance between studies, community services and activities. It lies alongside the Red Cross Haugland Rehabilitation Centre. The two institutions work closely together and share many facilities. The College has become a reality through the cooperative efforts of many organizations including the Norwegian National Committee of UWC, the Norwegian Red Cross and the host municipality of Fjaler. UWC Red Cross Nordic was set up with support from all Nordic countries, which provide the funding for the yearly running of it. In addition private sponsors have supported the building program and recent renovation efforts.


==Activities==

Activities offered at the college include, among many others, climbing, kayaking and hiking, Model United Nations (MUN), environmental groups and musical activities. The college raises political awareness through presentations held by external guest speakers and students on political issues which are open to the whole college and the surrounding community. The college participates in aid projects and works with the local and national Red Cross. The school has its own Red Cross Youth group. Many staff members and all students offer a range of activities to youngsters from many Norwegian schools during one week courses in spring, summer and autumn. This is organised through the college Leirskule (Camp School) program which is led by staff with the additional support of EVS volunteers.

==Aims==
The aim of UWC is to use education as a force to unite peoples, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future. UWC Red Cross Nordic, with a special emphasis on Nordic, environmental and humanitarian concerns, brings highly motivated young students from all parts of the world so they can live and learn together. The college&#x27;s objective is to help students become active, involved and educated citizens whose attitudes towards understanding and service will be a powerful catalyst for change. Through these students, who are selected on merit as representatives of their countries, UWCRCN hopes to influence their wider communities to become more understanding, compassionate and peaceful. The international UWC organization aims &quot;to create a better and more tolerant world”.

<text>So Wound is the second (and last) album by the Halifax (Nova Scotia) rock band Jale, released in 1996 on Sub Pop Records. A consciously more power-pop album than its predecessor, &quot;Dreamcake&quot;, &quot;So Wound&quot; received critical praise but failed to make significant radio impact.

Shortly after the release of &quot;So Wound&quot;, the band split up.

==Critical reception==
Ira Robbins, in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, wrote: &quot;Appreciably elevating the band’s skill and confidence levels from indie pop cuteness to real contention (while upholding the lyrical fortitude), the album is a taut, purposeful marvel of great pop songs in a number of cohesively connected modes.&quot;

<text>Frayssinet-le-Gélat (; ) is a commune in the Lot department in south-western France.

==History==
In Frayssinet-le-Gélat, members of the French underground shot and killed a German officer. For this crime, 15 hostages were taken and assassinated by the SS. Ten were young males from one-child families and five were young women. This was to prevent any further family line of descent. The schoolmaster tried to escape but was shot outside the school. Each May 21, villagers gather outside the church for an act of remembrance. Outside the church is a small monument mounted with a stone cross, and a plaque bearing the names of the victims. Another monument to the 15th victim stands where he was shot.

<text>BBC Children in Need is the BBC&#x27;s UK charity for disadvantaged children and young people in the UK. Between 1980 and 2023, it raised over £1 billion for them.

An annual telethon is held in November and televised on BBC One and BBC Two. Pudsey Bear has been &quot;BBC Children in Need&quot;&#x27;s mascot since 1985, whilst Sir Terry Wogan was its long-standing host for 35 years. A prominent annual event in British television, &quot;Children in Need&quot; is one of two high-profile British telethons. It is the only charity belonging to the BBC, the other telethon being Red Nose Day, supporting Comic Relief.

Following the closure of the BBC Television Centre, the telethon broadcasts took place at the BBC Elstree Centre from 2013 to 2020. The telethon previously lasted for up to 7 hours, but since 2020, it has been reduced to a 3-hour programme from 7pm to 10pm. In relation to the event having content designed for family viewing, the watershed is delayed until 11:30pm.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the telethon was reduced to a singular programme with only four presenters: Mel Giedroyc, Alex Scott, Chris Ramsey and Stephen Mangan. As of November 2021, the annual telethon takes place at Dock10, MediaCityUK in Salford. In October 2023 it was reported that for the first time in &quot;Children in Need&quot; history, the BBC&#x27;s 2023 appeal broadcast would have its first child co-presenter, with children&#x27;s TV star and upcoming &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Lenny Rush taking on the role.

==History==
=== Earlier BBC appeals ===
The BBC&#x27;s first broadcast charity appeal took place in 1927, in the form of a five-minute radio broadcast on Christmas Day. It raised about £1,342, which was donated to four children&#x27;s charities.

The first televised appeal took place in 1955 and was called the &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; Christmas Appeal, with the yellow glove puppet Sooty Bear and Harry Corbett fronting it. The Christmas Day Appeals continued on TV and radio until 1979. During that time a total of £625,836 was raised. Terry Wogan first appeared during this five-minute appeal in 1978 and again in 1979. Sometimes cartoon characters such as Peter Pan and Tom and Jerry were used.

=== &quot;BBC Children in Need&quot; ===
In 1980, the first &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon was broadcast. It was a series of short segments linking the evening&#x27;s programming instead of the usual continuity. It was devoted to raising money exclusively destined for charities working with children in the United Kingdom. The new format, presented by Terry Wogan, Sue Lawley and Esther Rantzen, saw a dramatic increase in public donations: £1 million was raised that year.

The format was developed throughout the 1980s to the point where the telethon segments grew longer, and the regular programming diminished, eventually being dropped altogether in 1984 in favor of a single continuous program. This format has expanded to include additional events broadcast on radio and online. As a regular presenter, Wogan had become firmly associated with the annual event, continuing to host it until 2014. The following year, he began to experience ill health, from which he passed away in 2016.

In 1988, BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; became a registered charity (number 802052) in England and Wales, followed by registration in Scotland (SC039557) in 2008. In 2020, it attended a Formula One Race with Mclaren F1 Team to help support &quot;Children in Need&quot; in Turkey.

Since 2016, the chief executive has been Simon Antrobus.

===Sponsorships===
Asda has been a part of the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity. Other sponsorships include McDonald&#x27;s, One Stop, Greggs, Enterprise, Welcome Break (which includes WHSmith, Waitrose, Subway, Burger King, Pret a Manger, Starbucks and Harry Ramsden&#x27;s), and Cineworld additionally joined the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity. The 2025 Sidemen Charity Match, held at Wembley Stadium, will be raising money for Children in Need.

==Sir Terry Wogan Fundraiser of the Year Award==
An award called the Sir Terry Wogan Fundraiser of the Year has been presented since 2016 to someone who has gone above and beyond to help raise money for &quot;Children in Need&quot;. The award was set up by Wogan&#x27;s family and was presented by Terry&#x27;s son, Mark, at the 2016 telethon in memory of the late Sir Terry Wogan. Joanna Lumley awarded it to Ellie and Abbie Holloway during the 2017 telethon. In 2021 Michael Ball presented the award to Amy Wright.

== Telethon ==

=== Acts ===
The telethon features performances from many top singers and groups, with many celebrities also appearing on the -hour-long programme performing various activities such as sketches or musical numbers. Featured celebrities often include those from programmes on rival network ITV, including some appearing in-character, or from the sets of their own programmes. A performance by BBC newsreaders became an annual fixture. Stars of newly opened West End musicals regularly perform a number from their show later in the evening after &quot;curtain call&quot; in their respective theatres.

=== Broadcast ===
The BBC devotes the entire night&#x27;s programming on its flagship channel BBC One to the &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon, with the exception of 35 minutes at 10 o&#x27;clock. simultaneously, &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;, Weather and Regional News airs, and activity continues on BBC Two with special programming, such as &quot;Mastermind Children in Need&quot;, which is a form of &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, with four celebrities answering questions on a chosen subject and on general knowledge.

Before the telethon itself, the BBC has broadcast &quot;Children in Need&quot; specials including &quot;DIY SOS The Big Build&quot;, &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot;, &quot;The One Show&quot;, in which hosts Matt Baker and Alex Jones did a rickshaw challenge and a celebrity version of &quot;Pointless.&quot; In which Pudsey assists hosts Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman.

Unlike the other BBC charity telethon Comic Relief, &quot;Children in Need&quot; relies substantially on the BBC regions for input into the telethon night. The BBC English regions all have around 5–8-minute round-ups every hour during the telethon. This does not interrupt the schedule of items shown from BBC Television Centre as the presenters usually hand over to the regions, giving those in the main network studio a short break.
BBC Scotland, BBC Cymru Wales and BBC Northern Ireland opted out of the network schedule with a considerable amount of local fundraising news and activities from their broadcast area. Usually they went over to the network broadcast at various times of the night, and usually they showed some network items later than when the English regions saw them. This was to give the BBC nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a much larger slot than the BBC English regions because the &quot;nations&quot; comprise a distinct audience of the BBC. Usually BBC Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed back to network coverage from around 1:00 am on the telethon night. For the 2010 appeal this changed, with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales deciding not to have their usual opt-outs and instead following the English regions&#x27; pattern of having updates every hour.

=== &quot;Children in Need&quot; Choir ===
Since 2011, one of the acts is a choir where over 1000 children come together in the studio and in around 8-10 locations across the UK and sing one song live in unison from the various locations.

== Pudsey Bear ==

The mascot fronting the &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal is called Pudsey Bear. He was created and named in 1985 by BBC graphic designer Joanna Lane, who worked in the BBC&#x27;s design department. Asked to revamp the logo, with a brief to improve the charity&#x27;s image, Lane said &quot;It was like a lightbulb moment for me. We were bouncing ideas off each other and I latched on to this idea of a teddy bear. I immediately realised there was a huge potential for a mascot beyond the 2D logo&quot;. The bear was named after her hometown of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, where her grandfather was mayor.

A reproduction of the bear mascot (made of vegetation) is in Pudsey park, near the town centre. Originally introduced for the 1985 appeal, Pudsey Bear was created as a triangular shaped logo, depicting a yellow-orange teddy bear with a red bandana tied over one eye. The bandana had a pattern of small black triangles. The mouth of the bear depicted a sad expression. The lettering &quot;BBC&quot; appeared as 3 circular black buttons running vertically down the front of the bear, one capital letter on each, in white. Perpendicular to the buttons, the words &quot;children-in-need&quot; appeared in all lower case letters along the base of the triangular outline. Accessibility for young readers, and people with disabilities including speech and reading challenges, were factors weighed by the designer Joanna Ball, specifically the &quot;P&quot; sound in &quot;Pudsey&quot; name, and the choice of all lower case sans serif letters for the logotype.
The original design was adapted for various applications for use in the 1985 appeal, both 2D graphics and three-dimensional objects. Items using the original 1985 design included a filmed opening title sequence, using cartoon cell animation, a postage stamp, and a prototype soft toy, commissioned from a film and TV prop maker (citation). The original prototype soft toy was orange and reflected the design of the logo, which was then adapted for approximately 12 identical bears, one for each regional BBC Television Studio. These bears were numbered and tagged with the official logo and auctioned off as part of the appeal. The number 1 Pudsey Bear was allocated to the Leeds region. Joanna Lumley appeared with one of the soft toys during the opening of Blackpool Illuminations and named Pudsey Bear the official mascot of the BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal.

In 1986, the logo was redesigned. Whilst retaining the concept of a teddy bear with a bandana over one eye, all other elements were changed. Specifically, the triangular elements of the underlying design were abandoned, and the corporate identity colour scheme was changed. The new bandana design was white with red spots, one of the buttons was removed and the logotype now appeared as building blocks, which spelled out &quot;BBC CHILDREN IN NEED&quot; in capital letters. Pudsey now had a smiling expression on his face rather than a sad one in the previous logo.

In 2007, Pudsey and the logo were redesigned again. This time, Pudsey&#x27;s bandana had multicoloured spots, and all of the buttons were removed. By 2009, Pudsey had been joined by another bear, a brown female bear named &quot;Blush&quot;. She had a spotty bow with the pattern similar to Pudsey&#x27;s bandana pattern. In 2013, Moshi Monsters introduced Pudsey as an in-game item for 100 Rox.

The &quot;Children in Need 2015&quot; campaign on 13 November 2015 marked the thirtieth birthday of Pudsey Bear, who has been the charity&#x27;s mascot since 1985.

In 2022, as part of the corporate BBC rebrand, the logo was completely redesigned. The phrase &quot;CHILDREN IN NEED&quot; in capital letters appeared in a modified rounded version of BBC Reith Sans Bold, and Pudsey Bear was removed as part of the logo. Despite this, Pudsey Bear remained in use as a mascot and was also given a redesign which involved making the multicoloured spots on his bandana larger and adding multicoloured spots onto the soles of his now white feet.

== Criticism ==

In November 2006, Intelligent Giving published an article about &quot;Children in Need&quot;, which attracted wide attention across the British media. The article, titled &quot;Four Things Wrong with Pudsey&quot;, described donations to &quot;Children in Need&quot; as a &quot;lazy and inefficient way of giving&quot; and pointed out that, as a grant-giving charity, &quot;Children in Need&quot; would use donations to pay two sets of administration costs. It also described the quality of some of its public reporting as &quot;shambolic&quot;.

In 2007, it was reported that presenter Terry Wogan had been receiving an annual honorarium since 1980 (amounting to £9,065 in 2005). This made him the only celebrity paid for his participation in &quot;Children in Need&quot;. According to Wogan&#x27;s account, he would &quot;quite happily do it for nothing&quot; and had &quot;never asked for a fee&quot;. The BBC stated that the amount, which was paid from BBC resources rather than from the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity fund, had &quot;never been negotiated&quot;, having instead increased in line with inflation. Two days before the 2007 event, Wogan waived his fee.

There has been concern about the type of groups receiving funding from &quot;Children in Need&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Ross Clark noted that funding goes towards controversial groups such as Women in Prison, which campaigns against jailing female criminals. Another charity highlighted was the Children&#x27;s Legal Centre, which provided funding for Shabina Begum to sue her school as she wanted to wear the jilbāb. Clark pondered whether donors seeing cancer victims on screen would appreciate &quot;that a slice of their donation would be going into the pockets of Cherie Blair to help a teenage girl sue her school over her refusal to wear a school uniform&quot;.

A former BBC governor said that Jimmy Savile was kept away from &quot;Children in Need&quot;. Sir Roger Jones who was also chairman of the charity said he had suspicions about Savile a decade before the news of Savile&#x27;s sexual abuse scandal came to public light in 2012. His comments came on the day an inquiry began into whether the BBC&#x27;s child protection and whistle-blowing policies were acceptable.

During November 2024, Rosie Millard stepped down as Chair of BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; after protesting over grants awarded to an LGBT youth charity whose former chief had been involved in a child abuse scandal.

<text>Sas or Szász (origin: Slavic for &#x27;Saxon&#x27;, Polish: &quot;Sas&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Szász&quot;, Romanian: &quot;Saș&quot;, Ukrainian: &quot;Сас&quot;) is a Central European coat of arms. It was borne since the medieval period by several Transylvanian-Saxon Hungarian, Ruthenian, Ukrainian, and Polish-Lithuanian noble families. The house was once a mighty princely and ducal house with origins in Saxony, Transylvania, Hungary and Ruthenia.

==History==
Ancient Polish-Lithuanian historians like Szymon Okolski say that the origin of these arms is derived from Saxony, where during the mid-12th century King Géza II of Hungary invited Germanic peoples of Saxony to settle in, establish trading centres and defend relatively sparsely populated Transylvania in the Kingdom of Hungary, upon which the Transylvanian Saxons were later given a privileged status in the &quot;Diploma Andreanum&quot; (Golden Charter of Transylvanian Saxons) issued by King Andrew II of Hungary (see Transylvanian Saxons).

The origins of the dynastic House of Sas or Szász vary depending on the source. According to the chronicles of Albertus Strepa; the outstanding military leader &quot;Comes Huyd of Hungary&quot; (a Transylvanian-Saxon), entered Galicia in 1236 with his mighty army of allied mounted warrior knights to the service of Daniel of Galicia King of Ruthenia, and each was rewarded with lands in Red Ruthenia that Huyd and his allied noble knights settled, being referred to as the &quot;Sas/Szász&quot; (Saxon) due to their Transylvanian Saxon dialect and origin.

According to the chronicles of Wojciech Strepa; &quot;Comes Huyd [Hujd] of Hungary&quot;, having come with his mighty army of allied mounted warrior knights to the service of Lev I of Galicia (1269–1301) the son of Daniel of Galicia King of Ruthenia, and having allied himself with Lithuania, drove the Eastern barbarians out of Mazovia. In reward for his knightly deeds, he was given, among other gifts, Lev&#x27;s widowed sister-in-law N.N. of Galicia Princess of Kholm as a wife (the widow of Lev&#x27;s brother Shvarn Daniilovich, sister of Vaišvilkas, daughter of King Mindaugas of Lithuania from the House of Mindaugas) and along with his allied knights lands in the territory of Red Ruthenia that they settled.

Count Huyd, who bore on his coat of arms the blue (azure) escutcheon with the gold (or) crescent, gold stars and gold arrow, and the knights who allied under his battle banner, are said to have been the progenitors of the House of Sas (Szász).
Early origins also point to the Hungarian Transylvanian-Saxon &quot;Voivodes&quot; Dragoş I de Bedeu (Bedő) voivode of Maramureș Prince of Moldavia and his successor son Sas de Beltiug (Hungarian &quot;Szász de Béltek&quot;) Prince of Moldavia, who bore the blue (azure) escutcheon with the gold crescent, gold stars and gold arrow on their coat of arms. Other notable scions of Dragoş I were Bartolomeu Drágfi of Beltiug (Béltek), &quot;Comes Perpetuus&quot; of Middle Szolnok (1479–1488), Voivode of Transylvania and &quot;Comes&quot; of the Székely people (1493–1499), who had distinguished himself earlier as a royal knight of the Hungarian Royal Court defeating the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Breadfield (1479) together with Pál Kinizsi, István Báthory, Vuk Branković and Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân. At the time of King Matthias Corvinus&#x27; death, Bartholomew Drágfi of Beltiug (Béltek) was among the wealthiest landowners of the country, three castles, two manor houses, eight market towns and about 200 villages were in his property. His estates in Middle Szolnok and Satu Mare included the castles of Chioar and Ardud together with the large lordships surrounding them, and further, the castles of Șoimi and the &quot;castellum&quot; of Ceheiu. Another important family member, among others, was Ioan Drágfi of Beltiug (Béltek) &quot;Comes&quot; of Temes County in 1525, who died 1526 in the Battle of Mohács.

Written descriptions of the Sas/Szász coat of arms in classical heraldic references, such as in &quot;Herby rycerstwa polskiego&quot; (1584), &quot;Korona Polska/Herbarz Polski&quot; (1728–1846) and Siebmacher&#x27;s armorial book on the Hungarian and Transylvanian nobility, describe the arms in blue (azure) tincture, as borne by the families Drágfi (Hungarian patronym for &quot;son of Drag&quot;) of Beltiug (Béltek) scions of Dragoş I of Bedeu, Jan Daniłowicz herbu Sas, Dziedoszycki (Dzieduszycki) h. Sas and Berlicz-Strutynskių (Strutyński) h. Sas. Some families, however, bear this coat of arms on a red (gules) tincture field, in &quot;Orbis Polonus&quot; (1641–43) the Sas clan arms is described as being of &quot;sanguineus&quot; Latin for &quot;blood red&quot; tincture, such as borne by the Counts Komarnicki herbu Sas family in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.

In 1843 the former palace became the property of Count Seweryn Uruski herbu Sas (1817–1890), marshal of the nobility of Warsaw Province, privy counselor of the Imperial Court and president of the College of Arms of the Polish Kingdom, who demolished the former palace and commissioned architect Andrzej Gołoński to design and raise a new palace in its place with Renaissance architecture. The sculptor Ludwika Kaufman was commissioned to carve the Sas coat of arms in reverence of the great progenitors of the Sas (Saxon) house. After the death of Seweryn Uruski in 1890 the palace became the property of his wife Countess Ermancja Tyzenhauz h. Bawół, then his youngest surviving issue Countess Maria Uruska h. Sas (1860–1931) who married Vladimir Światopełk-Czetwertyński.

Burned during World War II by the occupying German forces in the Warsaw uprising, the palace remained in the ownership of the Światopełk-Czetwertyński family until 1947, then passed into the possession of the University of Warsaw. During the years 1948–1951 the palace was restored by the architect Jan Dąbrowski. Today it houses the Department of Geography and Regional Studies.

<text>Durweston ( ) is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It lies northwest of the town of Blandford Forum. It is sited by the River Stour at the point where it flows out of the Blackmore Vale through a steep, narrow gap between the Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 398.

==History==
In 1086 Durweston appeared in two entries in the Domesday Book, being recorded as &quot;Derwinestone&quot; and &quot;Dervinestone&quot;. It was in Pimperne Hundred, had fifteen households, of vineyards and a total taxable value of 6.5 geld units. The tenants-in-chief were Aiulf the chamberlain and Hawise, wife of Hugh son of Grip. &quot;Dyrwyneston&quot; may be another variation.

Durweston parish was previously two parishes: Durweston and Knighton. The present-day parish church is on the site of the church that belonged to Knighton parish; the original Durweston church occupied a site near Durweston Mill, though little trace remains today. The two parishes were combined in 1381 for reasons not known. The current church was mostly rebuilt in 1846, though the tower dates from the 15th century.

A new village hall was opened in Durweston in April 2003. It is a venue for entertainment events and social gatherings, and is also a business conference centre for the wider community of North Dorset.

==Geography==
Durweston village is sited on the southwest bank of the River Stour at an altitude of . Measured directly, it is northwest of Blandford Forum, southeast of Sturminster Newton and south of Shaftesbury. The A357 main road between Blandford and Sturminster passes through the village. Durweston parish covers and extends west from the river over chalk hills, reaching an altitude of about .

==Culture==

Durweston is one of the last places in the area, if not the last, to maintain a tradition known as &quot;shroving&quot;, a regional juvenile begging custom of obscure origin. Every Shrove Tuesday children from Durweston Primary School process around the village during the morning, calling on local people, singing songs and giving flowers. Those who are visited may also give the children bread or other tidbits to eat. One suggestion for the tradition&#x27;s origin is that it is a survival of a medieval dole, though it was unrecorded in the region before the end of the 18th century. By the 1950s it continued in only a few places, and only survives at Durweston due to a bequest in 1925.

The shroving chant which was repeated at each door in the expectation of a gift of confectionary:

&quot;We be come a shroving

For a piece of truckle-cheese

Or a piece of bacon

Of your own making

So light the fire and het the pan

For we be come a shroving&quot;&lt;br&gt;

For many generations the people who live in Durweston have sung a collection of carols unique to their village, now known as the Durweston Carols. These were probably composed between 1750–1850, and form part of a forgotten repertory from English parish churches. These came to be known as &#x27;gallery carols&#x27; because they were often performed by groups of voices and instruments in the west gallery of country parish churches and, until 1877, there was a gallery in Durweston Church. During the Christmas period of 2009, residents of the village and the surrounding area gathered to record and document the Durweston Carols.

==Media==
Durweston has its own monthly village magazine &quot;Durweston News&quot;, as well as a bi-monthly Christian &quot;Benefice Magazine&quot; shared with the neighbouring parishes of Stourpaine, Pimperne and Bryanston.

==Miscellaneous==
A coastal minesweeper called HMS &quot;Durweston&quot; was launched at the Dorset Yacht Company’s Hamworthy yard on 18 August 1955.

<text>Des chiffres et des lettres (; &quot;Numbers and Letters&quot;) is a French television programme which originally aired from 1965 to 2024. It was created by Armand Jammot and tests the numeracy skills and vocabulary of two contestants. It was one of the longest-running game shows in the world, and the inspiration for &quot;Countdown&quot; on Britain&#x27;s Channel 4.

The game debuted in 1965 as &quot;Le mot le plus long&quot; using letters only, and reached its present format in 1972. From 2004 to 2024, it was transmitted on France 3 after 39 years first on Antenne 2 and then France 2. It had been hosted since 1992 by Laurent Romejko, who was originally assisted by Arielle Boulin-Prat and Bertrand Renard, the latter two respectively checking words proposed by the contestants and providing solutions to the number problems the contestants fail to solve. Renard was hired on the show at the age of 19, after having won as a contestant in 12 consecutive matches. Starting on 17 September 2022, Boulin-Prat was replaced by Blandine Maire and Renard by Stéphane Crosnier, due to disputes over their salaries and the terms of their contracts. The show came to an end on 25 August 2024 after a 52-year run, it aired at weekends during its last two years. 

The show was seen throughout the world on TV5Monde including TV5 Québec Canada throughout Canada.

==Rules==
Two contestants played against one another. As the title of the game indicates, it was based on two skills, numeracy and literacy, and featured three types of challenges:

* Standard letter/number problems, in which both contestants have a chance to score points
* &quot;Duels,&quot; speed problems in which only one contestant can score
* A &quot;Final Sprint,&quot; consisting of two problems that each award points to only one contestant

The first player to win two games out of three, or to win a single game by 50 points or more, wins the match and takes/retains the championship. 

Each show is made up of 16 problems presented in three sections. The first and second sections consist of two letter problems and two numbers problems played alternatively and followed by a duel. The third round consists of two letter problems and two numbers problems played alternatively and followed by the final sprint. If the players are tied at the end of the program a buzzer question is used to break the tie.

Winners can remain on the show for up to 10 consecutive matches.

===&quot;Numbers round&quot;===
Six numbers are chosen at random from a group consisting of the integers 1 through 10 inclusive, 25, 50, 75, and 100. It is possible for the same number to be chosen more than once. A random three-digit target number from 101 to 999 is then generated, and the contestants are given 40 seconds to work out a series of calculations whose final total is equal to that target. They may only use the four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and do not have to use all six numbers. Only positive integers may be obtained at any step, and no number may be used more times than it appears in the selection. 

====Example====
:Numbers given:
::8 4 4 6 8 9

:Target number:
::594

:: 8 + 8 = 16
:: 16 × 4 = 64
:: 6 − 4 = 2
:: 64 + 2 = 66
:: 66 × 9 = 594

Or

:: 8 × 8 = 64
:: 64 − 4 = 60
:: 60 + 6 = 66
:: 66 × 9 = 594

Contestants signal that they have obtained the target number by saying &quot;le compte est bon&quot; (&quot;the total is good&quot;), then give the details of their calculations. Ten points are awarded for reaching the target exactly, or for coming as close as possible if an exact solution cannot be reached (as verified by a computer). If neither contestant obtains the best possible solution, the one who comes closest to the target scores seven points. Both contestants score in this case if their results are identical or equally close to the target on either side.

====Numbo====
In 1987, Daniel Defays implemented a computer program called &quot;Numbo&quot; which uses probabilistic parallel processing to model human performance in the game &quot;Le compte est bon&quot;.

===&quot;Letters round&quot;===
In this round, one contestant is asked how many vowels they would like to be used in a selection of 10 randomly generated letters, each chosen unseen from all possible vowels or consonants. The same letter may appear more than once. The game originally used seven letters, increasing with time to eight and then nine; the 10-letter rule was instituted on 4 April 2010. Contestants previously selected letters by calling for one vowel or consonant at a time.

Once the letters are selected, the contestants are given 30 seconds to form the longest word possible, using each letter no more times than it appears. The contestant who forms the longer valid word scores one point per letter used; if both contestants find the same word or words of equal length, each one scores. Diacritics are not shown on the letters, but may be added as needed: for instance, the French word &quot;épeler&quot; (to spell) can be formed with the tiles E P E L E R.

====Example====
* With the following letters:

::T O C E D A M I T S

it is possible to get the French words &quot;dictats, amodies&quot; and &quot;mastoïde&quot;.
* With the following letters:

::R U R E T E C E R Z

it is possible to get the French words &quot;recruter&quot; and &quot;érecteur&quot;.

===Duels===
There are several variations of the &quot;duel&quot; section:

* The classic version: given a selection of 10 letters, use each of them once and only once to form two words fitting a common theme
* &quot;L&#x27;un dans l&#x27;autre&quot; (&quot;one within the other&quot;): with ten given letters, find a ten-letter word and another word, within the first; one a proper noun, the other a common noun
* &quot;La bonne orthographe&quot; (&quot;correct spelling&quot;): be the first to spell a given word correctly
* &quot;Le calcul mental&quot; (&quot;mental arithmetic&quot;): be the first to complete a sequence of calculations in one&#x27;s head (e.g. (((((889 - 662) + 697) / 7) * 6) / 4) ; answer = 198)

Only one answer is accepted, from the first player to buzz-in. If the answer is correct, ten points (originally five points) are awarded to the player giving it. If the answer is incorrect, the opponent receives three points.

Before the regular letters and numbers rounds, a toss-up duel is played, with the winner earning a &quot;sesame,&quot; or joker, that can be used in the final bonus game (introduced in 2016).

=== Final sprint ===
At the end of the game, the contestants play the &quot;final sprint&quot; where they have to solve two problems. As opposed to the other rounds during the game (except duels), these have been generated prior to the show and they admit at least one perfect solution (either a 10-letter word or a number that can be found with the six given numbers) the contestants must find as fast as possible. As in duels, only one answer is accepted, from the first player to provide one. If the answer is correct, five points are awarded to the player giving it. If the answer is incorrect, the player&#x27;s opponent receives three points.

Each contestant, starting from the lowest-scored one, chooses which kind of problem they want to play with : numbers or letters.

=== Les mots de la fin ===
This round was introduced in 2016 along with a new set for the show. Only the winning contestant plays this round, and they have two minutes to find the longest word possible in eight different 10-letter selections, receiving €100 per correct answer given. The length of the longest word is given for each selection. The contestant may pass as often as desired, and the selections are cycled until the time expires or all eight have been solved. If the contestant has a joker earned from the opening duel, they may call &quot;sesame&quot; and receive the €100 for the current letter selection. If the contestant solves all eight selections without using the joker, they win an extra €100 for a daily potential maximum of €900.

The maximum possible winnings a contestant can achieve is €9,000 over 10 matches.

==International versions==
Legend:
: Currently airing or returning
: No longer airing
: Non-broadcast pilot

===Australian version===

An Australian version, called &quot;Letters And Numbers&quot; (the literal translation of the original), commenced airing on SBS on 2 August 2010. It was hosted by Richard Morecroft. It closely followed the gameplay of the UK version, albeit with a slightly more modern set (with subtly animated background), but the clock, manual letterboards and whiteboard for the maths problems were all present. In the course of the show there were 5 letter rounds, 3 number rounds and a final Conundrum round. The winners of each show carried over to the next episode (up to a maximum of 6 episodes, upon which they must retire), whilst the runner-up went home with a Macquarie dictionary. SBS &quot;retired&quot; the show in June 2012 and replaced it with the British version of the program, &quot;Countdown&quot; (not to be confused with the Australian music show of the same name).

===Danish version===
The Danish version was called &quot;Stav et tal&quot; (spell a number) and aired on DR.

===Dutch version===
&quot;Cijfers en Letters&quot; was broadcast in the Netherlands by public broadcasting organisation KRO from 1975 until 1988. Hosts were Han van der Meer, Maartje van Weegen, Robert ten Brink and Bob Bouma.

===Flemish version===
&quot;Cijfers en Letters&quot; was broadcast in Flanders on the Flemish commercial television channel VTM from 1989 until 1993. Host of the show was former radio host and DJ Jackie Dewaele, also known as Zaki. Assists were Walter De Meyere and Carine Van de Ven.

===Greek version===
The Greek version of the game show, Grámmata kai Arithmoí (), debuted 13 February 1976 on ERT1 with television host Christos Oikonomou. This version was televised until 28 December 1981.

On Monday 20 November 1989, Mega Channel produced a new version of &quot;Grámmata kai Arithmoí&quot; with television host Kostas Papadonopoulos, but this was cancelled after 19 February 1990 after 15 episodes, as Papandonopoulos&#x27; schedule had more-important obligations and the producers were unable to find a replacement host.

===Italian version===
&quot;Paroliamo&quot; is the name of the Italian version of the game, aired by Telemontecarlo and Rai Due for ten seasons.

===South African version===
The South African version was called &quot;A Word or 2&quot;, and aired on SABC2, from 1998–2008, hosted by Jeremy Mansfield. It followed a similar format to the UK version.

In the letters game, there were three stacks of consonants and vowels. Like in the French version, contestants picked alternately, but the person to begin the round also got to choose which of the three stacks was used for the round.

During the word games, both contestants score regardless of whether it&#x27;s the winning word or not. During the numbers games, only the closer answer scores.

The winner of each game earned R1000, and returned for another game. The runner-up won a dictionary and the home game. The ultimate winner won a R40,000 laptop, while the runner-up won a R10,000 PC.

===Spanish version===
The Spanish TV show &quot;Cifras y letras&quot; (&quot;Numbers and Letters&quot;) is another adaptation of &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot; on TVE 2. Originally presented by Elisenda Roca as of 1991, with a lavishly artistic designed studio and the music for each round being extracted from classical music, a movie soundtrack or similar. There are four rounds consisting of a number game followed by two letter games. Between the second and third round there was a duel that consists of finding two words on the same theme from the nine letters provided.

Points:
* Words are worth one point per letter, but a nine-letter word is worth double; that is, 18 points.
* The correct sum gets 9 points.
* The duel is worth 10 points. Just like the French show, only one answer is accepted, but if the answer is wrong the other player gets 10 points.

The winner would win 100,000 pesetas (€602) and get to play again the next day. If the game was tied, they both would get to play again the next day and each player would win 50,000 pesetas (€301).

The show has returned to La 2 in January 2024, hosted by Aitor Albizua.

===Swedish version===
The Swedish version was called &quot;Tänk till tusen&quot;, and aired on SVT1 from 21 December 1985 until 21 May 1988. It was hosted by Ulf Wickbom.

===Turkish version===
&quot;Bir Kelime Bir İşlem&quot; which means &quot;One word, one operation&quot; is the name of the Turkish version of the game, aired by TRT.

===Yugoslavian version===

&quot;Brojke i slova&quot; is the name of the Yugoslavian version of the game, produced by the TV center Zagreb for airing on the common Yugoslavian network JRT. The show used the Serbo-Croatian language and ran throughout the 1980s.

===UK version===
The first UK version of the series was broadcast on Yorkshire Television who commissioned a series of eight shows under the title &quot;Calendar Countdown&quot; which was to be a spin-off of their regional news programme &quot;Calendar&quot;. As the presenter of &quot;Calendar&quot;, Richard Whiteley was the natural choice to present. These shows were only broadcast in the Yorkshire area. The current long-running United Kingdom series &quot;Countdown&quot; began in 1982 on Channel 4 but still made by Yorkshire Television. It is a close adaptation of the same format, the main differences are that the rounds last only 30 seconds instead of 45, only one contestant chooses the letters or numbers in each round and the &quot;duels&quot; are replaced with the &quot;&quot;Countdown&quot; Conundrum&quot;, a nine-letter anagram.

The style of presentation is notably (and deliberately) more old-fashioned and uses no computerised elements whatsoever, other than a random number generator for the numbers round. Whereas contestants on &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot; use computer touchscreens to register their words / number solutions, &quot;Countdown&quot; contestants use pen and paper. Unlike &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot;″ computerised displays, &quot;Countdown&quot;″s letters and numbers are displayed as tiles physically placed on a board, with the time limit being measured using a huge analogue clock that stands behind the contestants, as opposed to a bar gradually filling in. The clock and the music played during the rounds, have become icons of the UK show.

No major prizes are offered; winners receive a teapot styled to resemble the clock and defeated contestants and retiring champions receive an assortment of show-themed merchandise. The top players during each series are invited back at its end to compete against each other for prizes that have included, at different times, a full leather-bound set of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, book tokens, and laptop computers. The low-tech and low-budget nature of the production is a subject of numerous jokes within the programme.

===U.S. version===
An unsold pilot for a U.S. version titled &quot;Countdown&quot; was filmed on 18 September 1990 hosted by Los Angeles Radio personality Michael Jackson, announced by Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, and produced by the Guber-Peters Company (successor to Barris Industries now owned by Sony Pictures Television). In 2023, the full pilot was posted on Wink Martindale&#x27;s YouTube page as part of his ongoing Wink&#x27;s Vault series.

====Main game====
Two teams, each with one celebrity (Heather Thomas &amp; Woody Harrelson) competed in a series of rounds involving forming words from a series of nine letters.

Letter tiles are arranged face-down into two piles; one all consonants, the other vowels. The contestant picks a pile, and Jackson reveals the top tile from that pile and places it on the board. A selection of nine tiles is generated in this way, and must contain at least three vowels and four consonants. Then, the clock is started and both contestants have 30 seconds to come up with the longest word they can make from the available letters. Each letter may be used only as often as it appears in the selection.

Both team members write down the words they have found during the round, in case they have the same one. The players may confer, but each player comes up with an individual word and shows them Match Game style at the end of the 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds are up, the players declare the length of their chosen word, with the player who selected the letters declaring first. If either player has not written their word down in time, he/she must declare this also. The words are then revealed. If either player has not written their word down, that is revealed first; otherwise, the shorter word is shown first. The teams score one point for each letter in both words, up to a maximum of 18. If a contestant offers an invalid word then they score no points. If the second player reveals the same word as the first, this must be proved by showing the word to the other contestant. Finally, two word authorities (Tony Pandolfo, Lori Huggins) reveal the best word they could find from the selection, aided by the production team.

Should a team find a 9-letter word, they instantly win $25,000.

The team with the most points after three rounds wins the game and goes on to the bonus round.

====Bonus round====
The team has 45 seconds to solve seven scrambled words (four, five, six, seven, seven, eight and nine letters long). All words had something in common, like &quot;At the Movies&quot;. The celebrity was allowed to assist. Getting each word was worth $200 and all seven words were worth $10,000.

As in the 80s versions of &quot;Pyramid&quot;, two games are played with the contestants switching celebrities for game two. The player with the most money from the bonus round returned the next day. If there was a tie, both players returned the next day.

<doc id="1073507" wikidata="Q2557968" url="?curid=1073507" title="Ślepowron coat of arms">
<text>Ślepowron is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the fifteenth century, the descendants of the Ślepowron family began to use names taken from their lands. This led to many different surnames being created within one family, symbolically united under the Korwin (raven) coat of arms, which is thus unique in Polish heraldry. Wawrzęta Korwin de Ślepowron is the oldest known ancestor of the family, although their oral traditions claim descent from Marcus Valerius Corvus, a Roman general.

==Blazon==

A black raven with a gold ring in its beak and its wings somewhat extended for flight, facing right, standing atop a cross, on the shoulders of a horseshoe standing erect with heels at the bottom.

The shield is blue and the horseshoe silver. Above the shield, on a crowned helmet stands a similar raven.

The horseshoe and cross were added to the coat of arms due to a marriage alliance with the Pobog clan. A later version adopted by many Korwin families is the Korwin coat of arms, in which the raven stands on a log rather than a horseshoe..
==History==

The name Ślepowron is said to be taken from the village of Ślepowrony near Płońsk, Mazowsze, which belonged to the then-established Korwin-Piotrowski family. According to &quot;Herbów Rycerstwa Polskiego&quot; by Bartosz Paprocki) this village was given to the knight Wawrzęta de Ślepowrony by Fr. Konrad Mazowiecki.

===Motto===
“Kości spròchniałe powstańcie z mogiły, 
Przywdziejcie ducha i ciało i siły&#x27; - 
Woronicz (found in Herbarz Polski, Hipolit Stupnicki)

===Sarmatian Totem===
The raven is of much older, legendary pagan origins. A Polish aristocratic clan of Sarmatian origin chose the raven, possibly as its &quot;rodnidze&quot; or clan totem.

===The 1224 Grant===

Many centuries later, a raven is attested in a grant of privilege to Warzęta Korwin z Ślepowrony, from Duke Konrad I of Masovia, given at Warsaw in 1224.

===The Roman-Hungarian legend===

The full Korwin shield, with the ring in the raven&#x27;s beak, came to Poland from Hungary almost two centuries later, via the &quot;Roman-Hungarian legend&quot; amid contacts between the Polish nobility and the Hungarian Royal Court.

====Roman legend====

The Roman tribune Marcus Valerius Corvus, born 370 BC of the gens Valerii, in 349BC accepted a challenge to single combat by a barbarian warrior. During the combat, a raven perched upon Valerius&#x27; helmet and pecked his foe&#x27;s eyes so fiercely that the barbarian was blinded. In memory of his victory, Valerius got the agnomen &quot;Corvinus&quot; from &quot;Corvus&quot; (raven). Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus (64BC-8AD) was Caesar Augustus&#x27; co-consul.

====Hungarian/Polish legend====
In the Kingdom of Hungary, the Wallachian-Hungarian family of Korvin had flourished since the 15th century. Janos Hunyadi and his son Matthias Corvinus Hunyadi, King of Hungary and Bohemia, called themselves &quot;Corvinus&quot; and minted coins displaying a raven with a ring.

The epithet &quot;Corvinus&quot; was coined by Matthias&#x27; biographer, the Italian Antonio Bonfini, who claimed that the Hunyadi family descended from Marcus Valerius Corvinus, who had supposedly settled on the Dacian-Pannonian frontiers, the future Hungary. This claim was later taken over by the Polish aristocrats connected with the Hungarian Hunyadi family. 
==== House Medonich ====
The house of Medonich, of Magyar origin, anciently held territories in the Moldavian region of eastern Hungary, in the forests of Transylvania and Moldavia. The family was recorded to attend the national council of 1221 in which King Andras II issued the Golden Bull according self-determination to the nobles and gentry

Konrada Mazowieckiego established the Slepowron, Stracchowa, Drozkzion and Wola clans in 1224. His descendants through his son Korwin or Corwins were nobles in north Italy. Another branch settled in Drozkzino Latvia and Slavonia. One member of the Medonich family appeared at the Prussian court in 1414 acting as a representative for his family in Galacia; another appeared at Dobryczn in 1674.

===King Matthias&#x27;s Ring===

In addition to the above, the Silesian Annals tell that a raven carried off the ring which King Matthias, (who was also ruler of the Duchy of Głogów, and Suzerain of all the Silesian duchies), had removed from his finger. Matthias chased the bird down and slew it, retrieving the ring - and in commemoration of this event, he took the Raven as a symbol for his signet sign.

Volney Erskine Howard was born in Norridgewock, Somerset County, Maine on October 22, 1809, to Richard Howard, a prosperous farmer. He attended Bloomfield Academy, Skowhegan, Maine and Waterford College. At the age of 22, Howard traveled to Mississippi to study law and he commenced law practice in Brandon, Mississippi. He was a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1836; reporter of the supreme court of the State of Mississippi; unsuccessful Democratic Party candidate for election in 1840 to the Twenty-seventh Congress; and editor of the &quot;Mississippian,&quot; a Democratic newspaper published at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

After his unsuccessful run in 1840, he moved to New Orleans, practicing law there until December 1844, and then moved to San Antonio to serve in the Republic of Texas. He was appointed the first Attorney General of the State of Texas in 1846 by Governor J. Pinckney Henderson, but he declined the appointment. He represented Texas&#x27;s District 2 in the U.S. Congress from 1849 to 1853 but lost a third re-election bid to Peter Hansborough Bell.

Appointed attorney to the Land Commission of California by President Franklin Pierce, Howard left Texas to move to California. He resigned after a few months to practice law in San Francisco. In 1856, he was appointed Adjutant General of California, following the resignation of William T. Sherman during the time of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance. His attempt to oppose the Committee by force failed. 

Afterward, he moved to Sacramento in 1858 to practice law but decided to leave northern California because he had made too many enemies while battling the vigilantes in San Francisco. In 1861 he moved to Los Angeles, where he served as District Attorney from 1861 to 1870, and served as one of the first judges of the Los Angeles Superior Court beginning in 1879. He was a delegate to the California constitutional convention in 1878–1879. His law firm included two of his lawyer sons, Charles Howard (killed in a gunfight with Daniel B. Nichols, son of a former mayor of Los Angeles, in 1869 in a saloon) and Frank H. Howard, who served as city attorney of Los Angeles. He served only one term on the bench, due to the ill health. He was nominated to a seat on the United States Supreme Court but declined because of failing health.

Howard died in Santa Monica, California on May 14, 1889 and was buried at Fort Hill Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Howard County, Texas was named in his honor.

<text>is a fictional character from the Japanese science fiction anime television series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; and its sequel &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, part of the Gundam franchise. In the former, Athrun Zala is introduced as a member from the military organization ZAFT, composed of genetically enhanced humans known as Coordinators. Participating in the war between Coordinators and regular humans, referred to as Naturals, Athrun discovered that his childhood friend Kira Yamato was a member of the Naturals&#x27; military organization, the Earth Alliance, despite being a Coordinator. Across the series, Athrun encounters Kira and, after almost killing him, Athrun starts questioning his own motives to participate in the war. Athrun returns in &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; participating in another war and is the protagonist of its compilation films. He is voiced in Japanese by Akira Ishida and in English by Sam Vincent in the Ocean dub and by Chris Hackney in the NYAV dub.

Athrun has appeared in manga adaptations from the series, taking the leading role in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge&quot;. He is featured in games from both &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and the Gundam franchise, as well as crossovers in general. Athrun&#x27;s character has been highly popular, taking high spots in polls from the Gundam franchise, as well as the Anime Grand Prix polls. Publications from manga, anime and other media have commented on Athrun&#x27;s character, providing positive response due to his relationships and his role in the series.

==Appearances==

===In the TV series===
In &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; Athrun is one of the genetically enhanced humans known as Coordinators who joined the military organization ZAFT that battles the regular humans, the Naturals, in the Bloody Valentine War. His appearance begins at the start of the series Athrun is a member of Rau Le Creuset&#x27;s team which carries out a ZAFT raid on the neutral colony Heliopolis. The team steals several advanced mobile suits created by the Earth Alliance; Athrun himself confiscates the . During the raid he finds that his childhood friend Kira Yamato has become the pilot of the mobile suit GAT-X105 Strike. As ZAFT is assigned to destroy the Earth Alliance ship Archangel, Athrun encounters Kira at times as the latter was protecting the ship to protect his friends. When Kira kills one of Athrun&#x27;s comrades in combat, Athrun tries to kill Kira by self-destructing the Aegis alongside the Strike, escaping just before its detonation. He is found by Cagalli Yula Athha of the neutral country Orb, who despite being angered by Kira&#x27;s supposed death, allows him to return to ZAFT after both discuss the reasons for killing.

After returning to ZAFT, Athrun is given the mobile suit by his father Patrick Zala for his achievements in war. Patrick orders him to track and recapture or destroy the mobile suit ZGMF-X10A Freedom, which was stolen by Athrun&#x27;s fiancée Lacus Clyne and to eliminate her. He is unable to follow his orders after he learns that Kira is alive and is the pilot of the Freedom. As the Archangel plans to face both ZAFT and the Earth Alliance to end the war, Athrun decides to talk to his father. Patrick reveals that he intends to continue the war on until all the Naturals have been exterminated. Upon Athrun&#x27;s refusal to reveal the location of Freedom and Justice, Patrick&#x27;s soldiers arrest him. He is later saved by the Clyne faction and joins the newly formed resistance group called the Three Ships Alliance which includes the Archangel. To end the war, Athrun and Cagalli go into Jachin Due. There they find Patrick was shot by a ZAFT commander before he could fire the superweapon GENESIS. Athrun then destroys GENESIS by detonating the nuclear-powered Justice inside it, to stop ZAFT&#x27;s attack.

Two years after the war in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, Athrun is living under the pseudonym working as Cagalli&#x27;s bodyguard, who rules Orb. In the declaration of the Second Bloody Valentine War, Athrun returns to ZAFT, hoping to avert the war. Athrun meets with ZAFT Chairman Gilbert Durandal, who appoints him a member of the elite special forces, FAITH. Athrun is assigned the new mobile suit and joins the ship Minerva from ZAFT. There, Athrun becomes commander of the mobile suit pilots, becoming a mentor to Shinn Asuka, though the two do not always get along well. In the fights against the Earth Alliance, the Archangel interferes to reduce the number of casualties, but Athrun decides not to return with them, stating that they are making the situation worse. During a clash between the three groups, the Saviour is destroyed by Kira&#x27;s Freedom, leaving Athrun without a mobile suit. Following ZAFT&#x27;s attack on the Archangel, Athrun begins to question their motives. Later, he learns that Durandal is preparing to frame him as a traitor. Athrun escapes from ZAFT with Meyrin Hawke in a stolen mobile suit, which is later destroyed by Shinn. The pair is rescued by the Archangel. During ZAFT&#x27;s invasion of Orb, Lacus gives Athrun the mobile suit, which he uses to join Kira and the Archangel to fight against ZAFT. Athrun goes into space aboard the Archangel and fights alongside them in their attempt to stop Durandal from implementing his plans. In the final battle against ZAFT he assists in the destruction of the superweapon Requiem, defeating Shinn along the way.

In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom, one year after the events of &quot;Destiny&quot;, Athrun is not a member of Compass like the other cast, but works as an agent of Terminal, alongside his former ZAFT colleague Meryin. Interestingly, he does not pilot the upgraded Immortal Justice, instead opting to let his mentee, Shinn, pilot it in his stead. He makes a surprise appearance later in the film, assisting Kira and the Compass team after they are ambushed by the Black Knights, piloting a Z&#x27;Gok. He reveals the true nature of the Foundation to the rest of the protagonists, as well as their plans involving the use of Requiem and the Destiny Plan, and snaps Kira out of his depression to renew his will to fight. In the film&#x27;s climactic battle, he engages the Black Knights ace pilot, Shura, revealing within the Z&#x27;Gok is his original Infinite Justice, now upgraded to the Inifnite Justice Type II. He is able to defeat Shura by humorously thinking of Cagalli sexually; freaking Shura out to avoid being mind controlled (Shura yells at Athrun for having an &quot;impure fantasy;&quot; a conversation Cagalli hears, who gets annoyed and blushes when she realizes what Athrun was thinking), and reunites with her at the end of the film on Earth, where it is revealed she still has the ring he gave her from &quot;Destiny&quot;.

=== In other media ===
Athrun appears in the original video animation &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus&quot; that expands his role from the sequel&#x27;s finale. Author Chimaki Kuori had enjoyed Athrun&#x27;s character in the &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; which resulted in the manga series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge&quot;, telling the events from the TV series from Athrun&#x27;s point of view.

Athrun appears in the two series of films compilations of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;, and is the narrative figure from the latter ones. He remains as an Orb soldier in the latter series&#x27; end, working alongside his former ZAFT comrades.

He also does not pilot a Gundam for the majority of the film, instead piloting a Z&#x27;Gok in his signature red colors. In the climax of the film during the final battle, the Z&#x27;Gok is revealed to be a shell unit for his true mobile suit, the ZGMF-X191M2 Inifinite Justice Type II.

==Reception==
Athrun&#x27;s character has been well received by anime fans, having appeared in the Anime Grand Prix popularity polls in the category of favorite male characters. He came in second in 2002, fourth in 2003, first in 2004, second in 2005, and third in 2006. In a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll, Athrun was voted as the third most popular male anime character from the 2000s. Two Sunrise polls asked fans what was the most memorable characters from &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; and from &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot;; Athrun was fifth in the former and third in the latter. In the poll focused in the best team ups between former enemies, he and Kira were second. In an online poll from 2012, Athrun was voted as &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;″s second most popular character. His Japanese voice actor Akira Ishida won as the most popular voice actor in the Seiyu Awards 2004 for his portrayal as Athrun in the category &quot;Best Actors in supporting roles&quot;. Athrun, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the Gundam series, were recognized in the second set of &quot;Anime Heroes and Heroines&quot; stamps, released in Japan in 2005.

Critical reception for Athrun&#x27;s character has often been positive. THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Derrick L. Tucker cited him as strong character with his questions regarding war resembling Kira&#x27;s. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment stated that while &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was primarily focused on Kira&#x27;s growth, Athrun often &quot;stole the show in a lot of ways&quot; citing their rivalry and his angst displayed during its final episodes. Comments have also been focused on Athrun&#x27;s and Kira&#x27;s relationship with IGN&#x27;s Andy Patrizio disliking the number of times they shouted each other&#x27;s names. Writing for Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme was worried about how much would Kira&#x27;s and Athrun&#x27;s relationship would be focused in &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, but liked how Lacus&#x27;s introduction added tension to it, because of how she and Kira started relating despite Athrun being engaged with her. Moreover, Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed the development from their rivalry as it resulted in well done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits. Furthermore, Athrun&#x27;s confrontations with Cagalli across the series were praised due to how their characters&#x27; were developed while talking with each other.

Reviewing the manga of &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; Julie Gray from Comic Book Bin praised his relationship with Cagalli, emphasizing how integral is it to the story. Don Houston from DVD Talk commented on Athrun&#x27;s background regarding his actions against his father to stop his plans &quot;in the name of super greater calling&quot;. Houston wondered about his future actions in &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; regarding his return to ZAFT as well as how his relationship with Durandal would be developed. Athrun&#x27;s last battle against Shinn Asuka in &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; was Liversidge&#x27;s favorite moment from the DVD he reviewed mainly due to how the former gives the latter &quot;a much deserved kicking&quot; with Athrun losing his temper. Samuel Vincent&#x27;s portrayal as Athrun in &quot;Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; was pointed by Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network as one of the strongest ones from the casting.

According to the website &quot;&quot; the couple Cagalli and Athrun is highly popular and the film &quot;Gundam Seed Freedom&quot; alongside its novelization cheered up the fans thanks to its focus on them and this can be explored further more as parallel to Kira and Lacus.

<text>Packet forwarding is the relaying of packets from one network segment to another by nodes in a computer network.

==Models==

The simplest forwarding modelunicastinginvolves a packet being relayed from link to link along a chain leading from the packet&#x27;s source to its destination. However, other forwarding strategies are commonly used. Broadcasting requires a packet to be duplicated and copies sent on multiple links with the goal of delivering a copy to every device on the network. In practice, broadcast packets are not forwarded everywhere on a network, but only to devices within a broadcast domain, making &quot;broadcast&quot; a relative term. Less common than broadcasting, but perhaps of greater utility and theoretical significance, is multicasting, where a packet is selectively duplicated and copies delivered to each of a set of recipients.

Networking technologies tend to naturally support certain forwarding models. For example, fiber optics and copper cables run directly from one machine to another to form a natural unicast mediadata transmitted at one end is received by only one machine at the other end. However, as illustrated in the diagrams, nodes can forward packets to create multicast or broadcast distributions from naturally unicast media. Likewise, traditional Ethernet (10BASE5 and 10BASE2, but not the more modern 10BASE-T) are natural broadcast mediaall the nodes are attached to a single long cable and a packet transmitted by one device is seen by every other device attached to the cable. Ethernet nodes implement unicast by ignoring packets not directly addressed to them. A wireless network is naturally multicast all devices within a reception radius of a transmitter can receive its packets. Wireless nodes ignore packets addressed to other devices, but require forwarding to reach nodes outside their reception radius.

==Decisions==
At nodes where multiple outgoing links are available, the choice of which, all, or any to use for forwarding a given packet requires a decision-making process that, while simple in concept, is sometimes bewilderingly complex. Since a forwarding decision must be made for every packet handled by a node, the total time required for this can become a major limiting factor in overall network performance. Much of the design effort of high-speed routers and switches has been focused on making rapid forwarding decisions for large numbers of packets.

The forwarding decision is generally made using one of two processes: routing, which uses information encoded in a device&#x27;s address to infer its location on the network, or bridging, which makes no assumptions about where addresses are located and depends heavily on broadcasting to locate unknown addresses. The heavy overhead of broadcasting has led to the dominance of routing in large networks, particularly the Internet; bridging is largely relegated to small networks where the overhead of broadcasting is tolerable. However, since large networks are usually composed of many smaller networks linked together, it would be inaccurate to state that bridging has no use on the Internet; rather, its use is localized.

==Methods==
A node can use one of two different methods to forward packets: store-and-forward or cut-through switching.

<text>Edmondsham is a village in Dorset, England. It is north west of Verwood and north of Bournemouth, near the source of a small stream which flows into the River Crane, Dorset; both are Sites of Special Scientific Interest. In the 2001 census it had a population of 200.

A rare shiny-leafed form of wych elm similar to &#x27;Nitida&#x27; was found in the village in the early 20th century, a leaf specimen prepared for the Kew Herbarium by Augustin Ley in 1910.

==Edmondsham House==

Edmondsham House was built in 1589 by builders William Arnold and family, and in 1905 was described by Sir Frederick Treves as &quot;grey with age&quot; and hence &quot;like a mist in the wood&quot;. The house and gardens are open to the public.

<doc id="1073527" wikidata="Q6144224" url="?curid=1073527" title="USS Cero (SS-225)">
<text>USS &quot;Cero&quot; (SS-225), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first submarine and second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the cero.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Cero&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 24 August 1942 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut. She was launched 4 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Katherine J. Barbey — the wife of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, Commanding officer of the Amphibious Force, Southwest Pacific Force at the time — and commissioned 4 July 1943.

==First War Patrol==
&quot;Cero&quot; cleared New London 17 August 1943 for Pacific waters, and on 26 September sailed from Pearl Harbor, bound for the East China and Yellow Seas on her first war patrol. This patrol was also the first American wolfpack, comprising &quot;Cero&quot;, , and , commanded from &quot;Cero&quot; by Captain &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen. At dawn on 12 October, &quot;Cero&quot; made her first attack, on a convoy of three freighters escorted by two destroyers; one of the merchantmen was heavily damaged. During this patrol, she damaged two other freighters, and a small patrol boat which she engaged on the surface.

==Second, Third, and Fourth War Patrols==
After refitting at Midway from 16 November to 13 December 1943, &quot;Cero&quot;, Edward Dissette commanding, made an unproductive second war patrol along the Truk-New Ireland route, then put into Milne Bay, New Guinea, from 12 January to 4 February 1944. Returning to the Truk-New Ireland shipping lanes, she attacked a freighter (later sunk by one of her sister submarines) and inflicted damage on another merchantman. She put into Brisbane, Australia, 2 March, and sailed 3 April on her fourth war patrol, off the Palau Islands. On 11 April 1944, a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber mistakenly strafed and bombed &quot;Cero&quot; as she submerged in the western Pacific Ocean about east-northeast of Biak Island. &quot;Cero&quot; suffered no damage or casualties. Her most successful day to date came on 23 May 1944, when she attacked two freighters and a tanker, sinking one cargo ship, and damaging the tanker.

==Fifth and Sixth War Patrols==
&quot;Cero&quot; was refitted at Seeadler Harbor, Manus, from 2 to 26 June 1944, then put to sea for the dangerous waters off Mindanao, where on 5 August, she sent another tanker to the bottom; fifteen days later she finished her fifth patrol at Brisbane.

On 19 September 1944, &quot;Cero&quot; cleared Darwin, Australia, for the Mindanao and Sulu Seas for her sixth patrol. She called &quot;en route&quot; at Mios Woendi, where she took on board of supplies for Philippine guerrillas, along with 16 soldiers headed for behind-the-lines operations in Luzon. Although not permitted by her orders to attack escorted merchantmen while on this mission, &quot;Cero&quot; encountered two small craft on 27 October, and in a resulting gun action, damaged both and forced them ashore. On 3 November, north of Manila, she made contact with the guerrillas, landed the soldiers and supplies, and took aboard four evacuees. Later attacked by a Japanese submarine, an alert bridge crew, led by Jim &quot;Red Dog&quot; Vermillion, enabled &quot;Cero&quot; to evade a torpedo aimed at her. Mission completed, she returned to Pearl Harbor 24 November, then sailed to the West Coast for overhaul.

==Seventh War Patrol==
&quot;Cero&quot;, now commanded by Raymond Berthrong, shoved off for action from Pearl Harbor once more 31 March 1945, on her seventh and most productive war patrol. Cruising off Honshū and Hokkaidō, she not only provided lifeguard services for air strikes on Japan, but sank two picket boats and damaged a third, as well as sending three freighters and a large trawler to the bottom.

==Eighth War Patrol==
Refitted at Guam and Saipan between 27 May and 27 June 1945, &quot;Cero&quot;, commanded by Raymond Berthrong, had lifeguard and picket duty off Honshū for her eighth war patrol. On 15 July, she rescued three survivors of a downed bomber, and later that day bombarded the Japanese lighthouse and radio station at Shiriya Saki, Honshū. On 18 July, while sailing for the Kurile Islands, &quot;Cero&quot; came under enemy air attack; a bomb that landed close aboard caused damage so extensive that the sub was forced to cut short her patrol and head for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 30 July.

==Post-World War II==
&quot;Cero&quot; made prolonged visits to New Orleans and Baton Rouge before arriving 5 November 1945 at New London, where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve 8 June 1946. She was recommissioned 4 February 1952, and on 22 March, &quot;Cero&quot; arrived at her new home port of Key West, Florida. For the next year she cruised in the Caribbean Sea and aided in the work of the Fleet Sonar School, then sailed north for inactivation. She was again decommissioned and placed in reserve at New London 23 December 1953.

&quot;Cero&quot; also served as a reserve pierside training vessel at the Detroit Naval Armory across from Belle Isle from 1960 to 1967, replacing . &quot;Cero&quot; was in turn replaced by 

&quot;Cero&quot; was sold for scrap in 1970.

==Honors and awards==

* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with seven battle stars for World War II service

Of &quot;Cero&quot;′s eight war patrols, all but the second were designated as &quot;successful.&quot; She is credited with having sunk a total of 18,159 tons of shipping.

<doc id="1073533" wikidata="Q2008562" url="?curid=1073533" title="Evershot">
<text>Evershot is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southwest England, situated approximately south of Yeovil in Somerset. It is the second highest village in the county at above sea-level. Evershot parish encompasses part of the nearby hamlet of Holywell, east of Evershot village. Dorset County Council&#x27;s latest (2013) estimate of the parish population is 210. The village has connections with the writer Thomas Hardy.

== Toponymy ==
There are several theories on the origins of the name Evershot. One is that it derives from &#x27;Eafor&#x27;s Holt&#x27;, &#x27;eafor&#x27; meaning wild boar and &#x27;holt&#x27; meaning wood. A similar theory places the origin at &#x27;eafor sceat,&#x27; meaning &#x27;wild boar thicket.&#x27; This fits in with the history of the village, but does not account for other names the village has had in the past. In 1202, the village was referred to as &#x27;Teversict,&#x27; and in 1268 &#x27;Theuershet.&#x27; This likely refers to the colour of the soil – the Old English word &#x27;teofor&#x27; meaning red lead. Another theory is that the name derives from &#x27;Varia&#x27;, an alternative name for the River Frome, and &#x27;shot&#x27;, the Saxon word for a brook.

== History ==
It is hard to trace the history of the village before the Norman conquest, but it is believed Evershot began as a boar pen approximately 1,100 years ago. Due to its close proximity to the River Frome a settlement was built nearby.

The oldest remains to be found in Evershot are three standing stones named the Three Dumb Sisters, now a bench. Local legend says that these are three sisters turned to stone for dancing on the Sabbath. It is believed that they originate from a plot of land close to the village, but it is not known when they were built or moved. They are possibly Bronze Age in origin.

In 1628 Christopher Stickland founded Stickland&#x27;s School &quot;...for reading, writing and grammar... for the instruction and breeding of men children ... a schoolmaster there for ever to train up, instruct and teach the same child in good learning, true religion and the fear of God.&quot;

In the 18th and 19th centuries economic activities in the village included tanning, turnery and coopery. Local timber supplies provided raw materials for these industries, such as oak bark for tanning. Products such as tanned hides, bowls, ladles and cheese vats were sent for sale as far away as Bristol, and subsidiary trades evolved to support the village&#x27;s population, which reached 600 in 1851.
In 1857 the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway (later the Great Western Railway) opened a line through the parish with a station for the village at Holywell, though difficulties were encountered in constructing a tunnel through the area&#x27;s greensand.

A fire in the village in 1865 destroyed eighteen buildings and left more than a hundred people homeless. Three fire engines were required to extinguish the blaze. It is likely that, had there not been the river nearby, the entire village would have been destroyed. Not a single person was killed during the &#x27;Great Fire of Evershot,&#x27; and a considerable amount was raised to help the homeless (£70 in two days, the equivalent of over £3000 today).

==Geography==
Evershot village is sited on greensand approximately above sea-level, among chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. It is the second highest village in the county, the highest being Ashmore in Cranborne Chase. The area forms the watershed between the drainage basins of the River Yeo, which flows north to the Bristol Channel, and the River Frome, which flows southeast to Poole Harbour. The village hall is the starting point for the Frome Valley Trail. Evershot is south of Yeovil, northwest of Dorchester and northeast of Bridport.

==Demography==
Dorset County Council&#x27;s latest (2013) estimate of the parish population is 210.

In the 2011 census the population of Evershot parish combined with the small neighbouring parishes of West Chelborough and East Chelborough was 334. No data from 2011 has been published for Evershot parish alone.

The historic population figures in the censuses between 1921 and 2001 are shown in the table below. Evershot parish is also shown separately for these census returns.
== Landmarks ==

=== St Osmund&#x27;s Church ===
The parish church of St Osmund is built on the site of an earlier chapel, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, dating back to the time of Richard the Lionheart. The first rector of Frome St Quintin and Evershot is listed in the church simply as Herveus, in 1115. Only the font basin, chancel arch and part of the tower arch of this earlier chapel remain within the current church, which was renovated to some extent in the 15th century, again in 1765, before a final rebuilding in 1852—3 and 1864. It features a Perpendicular tower and arcades. In 1889 the organ was also restored, renovated, and added to. The church clock was gifted in 1853 by the 3rd Earl of Ilchester at a cost of £150. It was designed by Edmund Beckett Denison and built by Edward John Dent. It is hand-wound once a week. Between 1783 and 1787, the poet George Crabbe was rector of the church. The church is Grade II* listed.

The source of the River Frome is in Back Lane, close to the church. Next to it is St John&#x27;s well, which was restored in 2000 and features information on local geology and history. The names of villagers were put on a plaque. The village is the starting point for the Frome Valley Trail long-distance footpath. 

Summer Lodge Country House Hotel was built in 1798 as a dower house by Henry Fox-Strangways, 2nd Earl of Ilchester. It was enlarged in 1893 and in 1979 became a hotel.

The village hall was given to the village after being used by the military during the Second World War. It is mostly used for music and art events.

To the west is a prominent rounded summit known as West Hill which is high.

==Thomas Hardy==
Evershot has connections with the writer Thomas Hardy, who called it &#x27;Evershead&#x27; in his fictional Wessex. The Acorn Inn featured as &#x27;The Sow and Acorn&#x27; in several of his works, including &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;. Tess Cottage in the village is named after that novel&#x27;s eponymous heroine, who stayed in a fictional version of it when visiting &#x27;Evershead&#x27;.

Hardy was also an architect and in 1893 he designed an extension for what is now the Summer Lodge Country House Hotel in the centre of the village. Hardy&#x27;s mother, Jemima Hand, was born and married in the neighbouring village of Melbury Osmond.

The Hardy Way long-distance footpath runs through the village.

<text>Wetaskiwin was a federal electoral district in Alberta, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1925 to 2015.

==Geography==
In its final configuration, the riding was located south of Edmonton and was legally described as commencing at the intersection of the westerly limit of the Town of Devon with the right bank of the North Saskatchewan River; thence generally southeasterly along the westerly limit of said town to the southwesterly corner of said town (at Highway 60); thence southerly along said highway to Township Road 494; thence easterly along said road to the westerly limit of the City of Leduc; thence easterly, southerly, easterly, northerly and easterly along the southerly limit of said city to Highway No. 623; thence easterly along said highway to the easterly limit of Leduc County; thence generally southwesterly along said limit to the northerly limit of the County of Wetaskiwin No. 10; thence easterly and generally southerly along the northerly and easterly limits of said county to the easterly limit of Ponoka County; thence generally southerly along said limit to the northerly limit of Lacombe County; thence generally southeasterly, generally southerly and generally westerly along the northerly, easterly and southerly limits of said county to the east boundary of R 4 W 5; thence south along the east boundary of R 4 W 5 to the south boundary of Tp 38; thence west along the south boundary of Tp 38 to the west boundary of R 8 W 5; thence north along the west boundary of R 8 W 5 to the north boundary of Tp 41; thence east along the north boundary of Tp 41 to the right bank of the North Saskatchewan River; thence generally northerly and generally easterly along said bank to the point of commencement.

This federal electoral riding represents the County of Wetaskiwin No. 10, Ponoka County, Lacombe County, Leduc County, part of Clearwater County and the cities of Wetaskiwin and Lacombe.

==History==
This riding was created in 1924 from Strathcona and Victoria ridings.

Like most federal ridings in Alberta, it elected a United Farmers of Alberta MP, former Calgary labour reformer William Irvine, in 1926 and 1930. Then, in 1935 and 1940, it elected Norman Jaques of the radical monetary reform party Social Credit.

Like most other ridings in rural Alberta, Wetaskiwin veered sharply to the right after World War II. It was represented by a centre-right MP without interruption from 1935 onward: Social Credit from 1935 to 1958, the Progressive Conservatives from 1958 to 1993, Reform from 1993 to 2000, the Canadian Alliance from 2000 to 2003, and the Conservatives after 2003. Individual centrist, centre-left or left-wing candidates were usually lucky to approach 20 percent of the vote; the last time a single candidate from a non-right-wing party cleared that hurdle was the 1968 federal election.

That aside, in this riding in every election from 1925 to 1957 (excepting 1935) and in 1962, the successful candidate did not win a majority of the riding&#x27;s votes. More votes went to the unsuccessful candidates than went to the successful one.

In 2003, a portion of Red Deer riding was transferred to this electoral district. These boundaries took effect at the 2004 Canadian federal election.

The riding was abolished ahead of the 2015 election. The bulk of the riding, including Lacombe, was merged with the northern portion of Red Deer to form Red Deer—Lacombe. Much of the northern portion, including the city of Wetaskiwin, was merged with Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont to form Edmonton—Wetaskiwin. Smaller portions were transferred to Yellowhead and Battle River—Crowfoot.

===Members of Parliament===











===Last member of Parliament===
Its most recent member of Parliament before it ceased to exist was Blaine Calkins, a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.

==Candidates for the 2006 election==

In the spring of 2005, Dale Johnston announced that he would not be a candidate in the next federal election. A nomination meeting held in May 2005 selected Blaine Calkins as the Conservative Party candidate. Calkins was born and raised in the Lacombe area. He is a graduate of the University of Alberta, and a tenured faculty member at Red Deer College. He began his career in politics as a member of the Lacombe Town Council, and as such has been involved with the Board of Directors of the Lacombe Municipal Ambulance Society, the Board of Directors for Family and Community Support Services, The Municipal Planning Commission, David Thompson Tourist Council and the Disaster Services Committee. Calkins has been involved in the Reform/Canadian Alliance/Conservative Party since becoming a member in 1996. He served on the Candidate Nomination Committee for the Canadian Alliance Wetaskiwin Riding in 1999, and joined the Board of Directors in 2000. Since then, he has held various Board positions, including President, Vice President and Director of Communications.

Peter Crossley was the Liberal Party candidate for the 2006 election. Mr Crossley is a graduate from the University of Alberta and has an honours law degree from the University of Wales at Cardiff. He has operated his own law practice in Rocky Mountain House for the past 12 years, and has served on the Red Deer Kidney Foundation, the Rocky Kinsmen, and the Rotary Club.

Jim Graves was the candidate for the New Democratic Party in the 2006 election . Graves has 27 years of experience as a Professional Engineer, and has been a farmer-rancher since 1989.

Tom Lampman was the Green Party&#x27;s candidate for Wetaskiwin in the 2006 election . Lampman was the only candidate who also ran in the 2004 federal election, where he outperformed his party&#x27;s nationwide results by capturing 6.2% of the vote. Like the other candidates, he has experience with the farming industry, as he runs an agricultural consulting business specializing in dairy. One of his specific environmental concerns is thermal pollution from electric power generation. Lampman resides outside of Calmar.

<doc id="1073539" wikidata="Q57770" url="?curid=1073539" title="Argentine Air Force">
<text>The Argentine Air Force (, or simply FAA) is the air force of Argentina and one of three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic. In 2018, it had 13,837 military and 6,900 civilian personnel. FAA commander in chief is Brigadier Gustavo Valverde.

==History==
The Air Force&#x27;s history began with the establishment of the Army Aviation Service&#x27;s &quot;Escuela de Aviación Militar&quot; (&#x27;Military Aviation School&#x27;) on 10 August 1912.

=== Interwar period ===
Throughout the years following World War I, the predecessor to the Argentine Air Force received various aircraft from France and Italy. In 1922, the was temporarily disbanded, resulting in the formation of (&#x27;Aviation Group One&#x27;) as an operational unit. During 1925, the was reopened, and the (&#x27;Observation Group Three&#x27;) created, with becoming known as shortly after.

In 1927, the General Aeronautics Authority () was created to coordinate the country&#x27;s military aviation. In that same year, the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (lit. &#x27;Military Aircraft Factory&#x27;, FMA), which would play a crucial role in the country&#x27;s aviation industry, was founded in Córdoba. Despite that, throughout the 1930s, Argentina acquired various aircraft from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States.

By 1938–39, Argentina&#x27;s air power consisted of roughly 3,200 personnel (including about 200 officers) and maintained approximately 230 aircraft. Roughly 150 of these were operated by the army and included Dewoitine D.21 and Curtiss P-36 Hawk fighters; Breguet 19 reconnaissance planes; Northrop A-17 and Martin B-10 bombers, North American NA-16 trainers, Focke-Wulf Fw 58 multi-role planes, Junkers Ju 52 transports, and Fairchild 82s. Approximately 80 out of the 230 aircraft present were operated by the navy and included the Supermarine Southampton, Supermarine Walrus, Fairey Seal, Fairey III, Vought O2U Corsair, Consolidated P2Y, Curtiss T-32 Condor II, Douglas Dolphin, and Grumman J2F Duck.

=== World War II and immediate post-war ===
The first step towards establishing the Air Force as a separate branch of the Armed Forces was taken during 11 February 1944 to establish the Aeronautical Command-in-Chief (&quot;Comando en Jefe de Aeronáutica&quot;) directly under the mandate of the Department of War. This later became the Argentine Air Force by decree on 4 January 1945, which also created the Secretary of Aeronautics (&quot;Secretaría de Aeronáutica&quot;).

At the end of World War II, the Air Force began a process of modernization. This &#x27;golden age&#x27; (roughly 1945–1955) was ushered in by the availability of foreign currency in Argentina, an abundance of now-unemployed aerospace engineers from Germany, Italy, and France, and the British provision of latest-generation engines alongside other aircraft parts. In his first term, President Juan Perón brought teams of European engineers to the FMA, then known as the &quot;Instituto Aerotécnico&quot; (&#x27;Aerotechnical Institute&#x27;), or I.Ae., to promote aircraft technological development. The count totaled to around 750 workers, including two teams of German designers (led by Kurt Tank) and the French engineer Émile Dewoitine.

In 1947, the Air Force purchased 100 Gloster Meteor jet fighters. These aircraft were paid for by the United States to partially pay back its debt to Argentina, which had provided them with raw materials during World War II. This purchase caused the Argentine Air Force to become the first in Latin America equipped with jet-propelled combat fighters. In addition, several Avro Lincoln and Avro Lancaster bombers were also acquired.

The Air Force, with former Luftwaffe officers as consultants and with the European teams that Perón had brought, also began to develop its own aircraft, including the I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I and the I.Ae. 33 Pulqui II jet fighter prototypes. These manufactures gave Argentina the positions of the first country in Latin America and the sixth in the world to develop jet fighter technology on its own. Other Argentina-developed aircraft included the prototypes the I.Ae. 23 trainer, the bi-motor fighter I.Ae. 30 Ñancú, and the assault glider I.Ae. 25 Mañque; and the production twin-engine I.Ae. 35 Huanquero transport, the I. Ae 22 DL advanced trainer, and the I.Ae 24 Calquín twin-engine attack-bomber; as well as rockets, and planes for civilian use (like the FMA 20 El Boyero). 

=== Cold War period ===

==== The &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; (1955) ====
The Argentine Air Force came into active operation for the first time on June 16, 1955, during the bombing of the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires. Government loyalist Gloster Meteors fought rebel planes that attempted a failed assassination of the President as part of a coup d&#x27;état. The plan failed, and the rebels bombed the city and the House of Government. In the following September coup, the Air Force supported Perón&#x27;s government by initiating combat operations and transporting troops and arms with a meager five aircraft defecting to the other side. After the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; succeeded and the coup took place, previously mentioned manufacturing operations ceased and most foreign workers left the country, including engineer Kurt Tank who went to work in India. Despite claims that the Argentine Air Force &quot;baptism by fire&quot; took place during the Malvinas War (1982), this was actually the first time it entered combat.

==== Antarctic support ====

During 1952, the Air Force started supplying the Antarctic scientific bases using ski-equipped Douglas C-47s. Previously, President Juan Perón had created the Antarctic Task Forces (FATA, &quot;Fuerzas de Tareas Antárticas&quot;) to fulfill this purpose. In 1970, the Air Force began operating C-130 Hercules aircraft into Antarctica. The Fokker F-28 Fellowship presidential aircraft is reported to be the first jet to have landed there, in 1973. Since the 1970s, DHC-6 Twin Otters have also been deployed, with the Air Force launching Operation Transantar in October 1973. This resulted in the first trans-Antarctic three-continent flight in history when a Hercules C-130 flew between Río Gallegos; Marambio Base; Christchurch, New Zealand and Canberra, Australia.

==== Modernization (1960s–1970s) ====
In the 1960s, new aircraft were incorporated, including the F-86F Sabre jet fighter and the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk mainly used for ground-attack. During the 1970s, the Air Force re-equipped itself with Mirage III interceptors, IAI Dagger multi-role fighters, and C-130 Hercules cargo planes. A counter-insurgency airplane, the Pucará, was also manufactured and used in substantial numbers. The Air Force also had an important role in the 1976 coup which lead to a military dictatorship that lasted until 1983.

==== Falklands War (1982) ====

The Falklands War was the first war fought by the Argentine Air Force against an external enemy. Some operational aircraft were obsolete. However, the airforce came close to winning the war for Argentina. During the war, the Air Force division of the Military Junta was called the &quot;Fuerza Aérea Sur&quot; (FAS, &#x27;Southern Air Force&#x27;), and led by Ernesto Crespo.

Air engagements began on May 1, 1982 with the UK&#x27;s Royal Air Force initiating Operation Black Buck, in which the Avro Vulcan bomber XM607 attacked military air bases on the islands. The Task Force then sent Sea Harriers to attack positions at Stanley and Goose Green, where the first Argentine casualties occurred.

The Argentine Air Force reacted by sending multiple IAI Dagger, A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft, and Mirage III interceptors into the fray. The Mirage III went into combat with the Harriers on Bourbon Island, with one Mirage lost to a Harrier. On May 21, the Battle of San Carlos (&quot;Bomb Alley&quot;) began once the Air Force attacked a detachment of British ships involved in the landing in the San Carlos Water. The Dagger and Skyhawk aircraft sank three British ships (HMS &quot;Coventry&quot;, a Type 42 destroyer; and two frigates, HMS &quot;Antelope&quot; and HMS &quot;Ardent&quot;).

On June 8, the Air Force carried out an operation in Bluff Cove. The British were using the landing ships RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; and RFA &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; to position the 5th Infantry Brigade for an assault on Port Stanley. As these ships were unloading and therefore vulnerable, they were attacked by nine A-4 Skyhawks in two waves, while five Daggers attacked the escorting frigate and four more conducted a decoy mission over the north of the islands to draw off British Sea Harriers. The Skyhawks destroyed the landing craft &quot;Foxtrot 4&quot;, damaged the &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; so badly that it was subsequently scuttled and also severely damaged the &quot;Sir Tristram,&quot; although she survived and was later rebuilt. Fire and explosions on the ships resulted in 56 deaths and 150 wounded; the worst single loss of life for the British in the war. After their attack, three A-4s from the second wave were shot down by Sea Harriers, killing all three pilots. All the explosive ordnance deployed by the Daggers failed to explode.

On June 13, the A-4 Skyhawks of the Argentine Air Force renewed their attacks in two formations of four aircraft each and launched an attack against enemy troops and helicopters. On June 14, 1982, the Argentine command surrendered, returning control of the Falklands, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands to the United Kingdom. The Argentine Air Force suffered 55 dead and 47 wounded, with 505 combat departures and 62 aircraft losses, as listed below:
* 19 A-4 Skyhawk
* 2 Mirage III
* 11 Dagger
* 2 Canberra
* 24 IA-58 Pucará
* 1 C-130H Hercules
* 1 Learjet 35
* 2 Bell 212
=== Post-war (1983–2003) ===
After the war, the UK imposed an arms embargo on Argentina. The United States, however, sold Argentina 36 A-4AR Fighting hawks, a refurbished and upgraded version of the A-4 Skyhawks. Other equipment purchased by Argentina were: 23 US Army surplus OV-1 Mohawks, 2 C-130B, and 1 Lockheed L-100-30. 

Argentina started the development of brand new aircraft, including the FMA IA-63 Pampa, the combat fighter FMA SAIA 90, and the subsequent transformation of the Condor missile into a medium-range ballistic missile. Of these, only the Pampa was successfully developed.

During 1994, President Carlos Menem discontinued mandatory military service and began allowing women to serve.

=== Support to UN peacekeeping missions ===
The Argentine Air Force has been involved in United Nations peacekeeping missions, sending a contingent to Cyprus in 1994 and deploying Bell 212 helicopters to Haiti during 2005.

=== Early 21st century ===
In early 2005, seventeen brigadiers, including the Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Carlos Rohde, were fired by President Néstor Kirchner following a scandal involving drug trafficking through Ezeiza International Airport. Kirchner cited failures in the security systems of the Argentine airports, which were overseen by the National Aeronautic Police, then a branch of the Air Force (predecessor of the today independent Airport Security Police), and cover-ups of the scandal.

==== 2010s ====
, budgetary constraints continued, leading to the disbanding of the Boeing 707 transport squadron and maintenance problems for half of the C-130 Hercules fleet.

In August 2010, a contract was signed for two Mi-17E helicopters, plus an option on a further three, to support Antarctic bases.

The FAA has been seeking to replace its ageing force with more capable and more serviceable modern aircraft. The acquisition of Spanish Mirage F1Ms, IAI Kfir Block 60s and Saab Gripen E/Fs were considered, but as of February 2015, all of those deals appear to have stalled; the Mirage F1 deal was scrapped by the Spanish government in March 2014, after pressure from the UK to not assist in FAA modernization over tensions between the countries over the Falkland Islands. The UK has also managed to veto the sale of Gripen E/Fs, as 30% of the Gripen&#x27;s parts are manufactured there. The deal with Israel has reportedly stalled for technical and political reasons. China has allegedly offered JF-17/FC-1&#x27;s and Chengdu J-10&#x27;s to Argentina. The two countries have formed a working group to look into the transfer of 14 aircraft. Russia had also offered to lease 12 Su-24 strike aircraft to the FAA, but Jane&#x27;s reported that the Su-24 would not be very useful to the FAA and that &quot;it would appear that any proposed transfer of such aircraft is likely the result of Russia playing political games with the UK over the continuing crisis in Ukraine.&quot; All Mirages were officially decommissioned on 30 November 2015. The A-4s were grounded , for lack of spares; in any case only 4–5 were airworthy with the rest in storage at Villa Reynolds. When Barack Obama visited in March 2016, Air Force One was accompanied by US Air Force F-16s because Argentina could only offer Pucarás and Pampas for air defense.

As of July 2019, the Argentine Air Force and government selected the KAI FA-50 as its interim fighter. With this act being the first step in modernizing the fighter force and replacing the Mirage 3, Dagger, and Mirage 5 fighters that have also been retired; it was also anticipated that obtaining FA-50 would help mitigate the retirement of the Martin A-4AR Fightinghawk fleet, as they were ageing and becoming difficult to maintain. As of 2020, it is reported that as few as six of the Fightinghawk aircraft remain operational. While no specific numbers of aircraft to purchase were given, the media reported that up to 10 FA-50s were considered. Despite elections coming in October 2019, the deal had been expected to go through. An Argentine delegation first visited the Republic of Korea Air Force in September 2016. At that time an FAA pilot was able to test fly the TA-50 Golden Eagle operational trainer variant of the FA-50.

However, the deal appeared to have been canceled in early 2020, leaving the Air Force without a fighter replacement. Some sources suggested that the cancellation was due to the financial pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, while others reported that British intervention played a part by preventing the export of an aircraft incorporating various British components. In October 2020, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) confirmed that since major components of the aircraft were supplied by the U.K., the aircraft could not be exported to Argentina. Britain similarly blocked the potential sale of Brazilian license-built Saab Gripen aircraft to Argentina, given that some avionics were of British origin. Argentina was now said to be exploring the potential acquisition of aircraft from Russia, China, India or Pakistan. However, even sales of Chinese aircraft reportedly encountered potential problems since the ejector seats of the aircraft were the MK6, manufactured by Martin-Baker in the UK.

==== 2020s ====
Early in 2021, Russia made several proposals related to the acquisition of aircraft by Argentina including the apparent offer of MiG-35 fighters. These built on earlier offers of the MiG-29 as well as on measures being undertaken to extend the life of Mi-171E helicopters acquired by Argentina in 2010 to support operations in Antarctica.

To improve transport capabilities, two Fokker F-28 aircraft which had been decommissioned in 2019, have been refurbished and put into service, the last one (TC-53) in early August 2021.

In mid 2021, one analysis found that the numbers of operational aircraft with offensive combat capability were practically at a level of zero. In addition to only around six A-4 &quot;Fightinghawk&quot; aircraft being operational, the availability of C-130 transport aircraft was only assessed as being at six of originally 14 aircraft. However, 23 IA-63 &quot;Pampa&quot;, 12 T-6C+ &quot;Texan II&quot; and 12 EMB-312 &quot;Tucano&quot; trainer aircraft were reported operational as of 2021. In September 2021, the Government officially included funding of $664 million in a draft budget for Congress involving the purchase of new combat aircraft. In 2022, talks with China over the potential purchase of JF-17 Thunders, and possibly Chengdu J-10s, and with India for HAL Tejas fighter jets came to the fore. However in December 2022, Argentine President Alberto Fernández appeared to reject the notion of buying new fighter aircraft for air force, stating: “There are other priorities before buying weapons, definitely”. Referring to the strategic and political situation in South America he further commented that: “There are no war problems, peace is the common denominator between us.” It was simultaneously confirmed that the fighter aircraft replacement program had been stopped.
In early 2023, Argentina confirmed the purchase of six Bell 407 for the Armed Forces and plans for the modernization of its inventory of Hughes 500Ds pending the arrival of new Beechcraft TC-12B Hurons.

In June 2023, Argentina received an additional leased C-130 from the US, bringing the total number of operational C-130 to five aircraft. At the same time, the Biden administration asked Congress to approve the potential sale of former Royal Danish Air Force F-16s, as well as former Royal Norwegian Air Force P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, to Argentina. While the US was reportedly supporting the sale in order to avoid the possibility that Argentina would turn to China for its fighter aircraft, it was anticipated that the United Kingdom would urge Denmark not to make the sale. It was also unclear whether the combined acquisition cost (of $447 million USD) would be considered affordable by Argentina. On 11 October 2023, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Regional Security Mira Resnick confirmed to Jorge Argüello, Argentinean ambassador to the US, that the State Department has approved the transfer of 38 F-16s from Denmark. In March 2024, it was reported that the number of aircraft had been reduced to 24 but that discussions on concluding the deal would be initiated. On March 26, 2024, the Danish Defence Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, signed a letter of intent with his Argentine counterpart to transfer the aircraft.

==Organization==
The Argentine Air Force (FAA) is one of the three branches of the Argentine military, having equal status with the Army and the Navy; the President of Argentina is Commander-in-Chief of all three.

The FAA is headed by the Chief of the General Staff (), directly appointed by the President. The Chief of Staff usually holds the rank of Brigadier General, the highest rank of the Air Force, being seconded by the Deputy Chief of the General Staff and three senior officers in charge of the FAA&#x27;s three Commands: the Air Operations, the Personnel, and the Materiel Command.

The Air Operations Command () is the branch of the Air Force responsible for aerospace defense, air operations, planning, training, and technical and logistical support of the air units. Subordinate to the Air Operations Command are the Air Brigades (), the Air Force&#x27;s major operative units, as well as the airspace surveillance and control group (Grupo VYCEA, Argentine Air Force). There is currently estimated to be a total of eight air brigades operational. Brigades are headquartered at Military Air Bases ( (BAMs).

Each Air Brigade is made up of three Groups, each bearing the same number as their mother Brigade. These groups include:
*One Air Group (), which operates the aircraft assigned to the Brigade. The Air Group is divided into a variable number of Air Squadrons. Air Groups may be named according to their primary mission, for example, an air group specialized in fighter operations receives the designation of Fighter Group (&quot;Grupo de Caza&quot;). Currently, the Air Force includes three Fighter Groups (4th, 5th, and 6th), one Attack Group (3rd), one Transport Group (1st), and three plain Air Groups (2nd, 7th, and 9th). The 7th Air Group operates all the helicopters of the Air Force, while the 2nd includes a small reconnaissance unit as well as light transport aircraft. 9th Air Group is a light transport unit.
*One Technical Group (), in charge of the maintenance and repair of the Brigade&#x27;s aircraft.
*One Base Group (), responsible for the airbase itself, weather forecasting, flight control, runway maintenance, etc. Base Groups also include Base Flights (), generally made up of two or three liaison aircraft.

The Personnel Command () is responsible for the training, education, assignment, and welfare of Air Force personnel. Under the control of the Personnel Command are the Military Aviation School (which educates the future officers of the Air Force), the Air Force Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) School, and other educational and training units.

The Materiel Command () deals with planning and executing the Air Force&#x27;s logistics regarding flying and ground materiel. Materiel Command includes &quot;Quilmes&quot; and &quot;Río Cuarto&quot; Material Areas (repairing and maintenance units) and &quot;El Palomar&quot; Logistical Area.

<text>The Sigma Protocol is the last novel written completely by Robert Ludlum, and was published posthumously. It is the story of the son of a Holocaust survivor who gets entangled in an international conspiracy by industrialists and financiers to take advantage of wartime technology.

==Plot==
Ben Hartman is vacationing in Switzerland when he meets his old school buddy Jimmy Cavanaugh - who tries to kill him. As he dodges assassins, mysterious tails, and police while searching for a safe place to hide, he finds his twin brother, Peter, who was thought to have died in an airplane crash several years earlier. Peter describes an international corporation which was formed in the last days of World War II, composed of financiers, influential members of large corporations, and Nazi brass. He gives Ben a photo of some of the leaders, only to find out that their father was a member. Soon, Peter is killed by an assassin, and Ben escapes with his life again. He later meets up with Liesel (Peter&#x27;s girlfriend).

Meanwhile, United States Department of Justice Agent Anna Navarro is recruited by a secretive group within the DoJ to investigate the deaths of a list of influential men around the world who have been dying mysteriously. Her probes turn up false leads, possible coverups, and dead ends, until she finds out that the men have been poisoned by someone using the same obscure toxin. Following the leads, she finds that the men she had been assigned to investigate are part of an international group of financiers and business moguls. She soon finds out that she has been reported &quot;off the reservation&quot;, and the attempts begin on her life as well.

Through their own distinct investigative means, the two protagonists discover more about the shadowy group, which is called Sigma. It is learned that Sigma has grown from a simple attempt to plunder the Nazi treasury and stabilize the industrial and financial state of the world in the wake of the war, to a political and financial machine which controls as many as 75% of the world&#x27;s leading companies, and has enough covert political clout to directly influence the outcome of the likes of Presidential elections. Sigma also helped some of the Nazi war criminals, including Nazi doctor Gerhard Lenz, evade capture.

Protagonists Hartman and Navarro eventually meet and form an alliance, since both are being hunted by Sigma assassins. Through their concerted efforts, they discover that Sigma is experiencing an internal struggle. The founders, who are dead or dying, believe that Sigma should disband, as it had played its role in the world; they&#x27;re called the &quot;angeli rebelli&quot;, and are being hunted by the new Sigma leadership. That new leadership, an apparently philanthropic doctor named Jürgen Lenz, son of Sigma founding member Gerhard Lenz, has decided on a new direction for the group, and is determined to eliminate any internal opposition.

Navarro is kidnapped by Lenz, and Hartman tracks them to an old castle in the Austrian Alps. Successfully infiltrating the castle, he discovers Sigma&#x27;s new direction: age reversal. Lenz had found a way to reverse human aging based largely on WW2 era experimentation on children with premature aging also known as Progeria, and he had been treating some of the world&#x27;s elite to reverse their aging as well. Lenz was his own first successful experiment, for his real name is Gerhard Lenz - he is the Nazi doctor and a founding member of Sigma. After killing Lenz, Hartman and Navarro escape in a helicopter, while the castle is destroyed by an avalanche.

The book is based on the Bilderberg Group and the myths and mysteries surrounding it.

==Film adaptation==
On May 16, 2016, Universal Pictures and Captivate Entertainment announced the film adaptation will be a part of a cinematic universe of Robert Ludlum adaptations such as: &quot;The Janson Directive,&quot; &quot;The Covert One series,&quot; &quot;The Parsifal Mosaic&quot; and crossover films.

<text>Bearsted ( , ) is a village and civil parish with a railway station in mid-Kent, England, two miles (3.2 km) east of Maidstone town centre.

==Geography==
The village was historically concentrated around Church Lane and The Green which includes The Street. The village is on the north bank of the River Len, a tributary of the River Medway at the foot of the North Downs. A stream, the Lilk, flows south into the river Len through Bearsted.

Although part of the growing conurbation of Maidstone, the centre of Bearsted retains a traditional village look with 59 listed properties, many surrounding the village green, flanked by two pubs.

The parish of Bearsted has a population of 8010 (2001 figure) and is broadly divided into two areas of development. The traditional village of Bearsted with modern development around its conservation areas lies north of the A20 Ashford Road and the Madginford neighbourhood, largely constructed in the 1960s, lies south of the Ashford Road. The area includes a small supermarket and shopping centre, a park and ride facility and primary school. The parish also incorporates part of tudor Mote Park on its western boundary. Parts of Madginford were formerly part of the parish of Otham but to avoid division have been appropriated as part of Bearsted.

==Transport==
The village is connected by:
* Road: the A20 (London to Dover) trunk road passes through the village and junction 7 on the M20 motorway is 1.5 miles (2.5 km) north-west.
* Rail: Bearsted railway station on the Maidstone Line opened with the rail line on 1 July 1884. The station was originally named &quot;Bearsted and Thurnham&quot;.
* Footpaths: both the ancient Pilgrims&#x27; Way and the modern North Downs Way run along the North Downs north of Bearsted.

==Governance==
Bearsted in elections every four years elects one representative to Kent County Council; this is currently:
Bearsted elects three representatives to Maidstone Borough Council; they are currently:

The parish council has 15 elected councillors with published monthly meeting dates at Madginford Hall, Egremont Road, Bearsted, Maidstone ME15 8LH or St Peter&#x27;s Church Hall, Button Lane. Sometimes the finance and the planning committee meet at King George V Memorial Hall. In 2011 the parish council was elected, with elections every four years.

==History==
Holy Cross Church is located on Church Lane to the south of the green. A fair used to be held here on Holy Cross Day, an ancient festival traced back to 335 AD when the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was dedicated in Jerusalem. The dedication to Holy Cross appears to have been a relatively popular one for pre-Conquest foundations. It is a Grade I listed building. Its stone arch is partially Saxon, embedded with later work. On three corners of the tower are stone beasts. Many books on Kent describe the animals on the tower as bears, and say these represent the name of the village.

Hasted&#x27;s History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 5 (1798) reveals that the Anglo-Saxon name for the settlement was “Bergestede”, meaning “place on the hill/barrow”; other accounts refer to its earlier names as “Berghamstyde” and “Berghstede”. If the “Bergh” element does refer to a barrow (burial mound), this may be indicative of a church being sited on a previously revered site, in accordance with the advice of Pope Gregory to St. Augustine in 601 AD, which raises the possibility of this being a particularly early church site. It is possible that Bearsted is the “Berghamstyde” at which King Wihtred of Kent held a Council in 696AD and where he issued laws which are amongst the earliest of the Saxon written law codes.

The Green was known as the Hothe and used as common land and from the 15th to 17th centuries, a number of the buildings which provide The Green&#x27;s historical character were built.

==Listed buildings in the conservation areas==

Within the Holy Cross conservation area are:
Within Bearsted (The Green) Conservation area, which includes part of The Street from Oliver&#x27;s Cottages westward, the listed buildings with the dates of oldest sections, are: 


==Amenities==
The village is home to a tennis club along with a cricket club, bowls club and both a Scout group (1st Bearsted The Scarlet Pimpernels, founded 1912) and a Guide unit. Other establishments include a Rifle Club and The Bearsted and Thurnham Club, a private members&#x27; club, established in 1906, which overlooks the village green.

== Kent International Gateway Group Plans==

In early 2007, the Kent International Gateway Group announced plans to build a large rail-freight and logistics depot in the corridor between Bearsted bounded by the railway line and the M20 motorway, an area which in use as fields and woodland. The controversial plans raised significant objections from local residents and the Campaign to Protect Rural England.

The planning application was rejected by the local planning authority, Maidstone Borough Council, and a public inquiry was held into Axa&#x27;s appeal of this decision between 13 October 2009 and 23 December 2009. Following the public inquiry and review of the resulting Inspector&#x27;s report, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, rejected the appeal and refused planning permission for the development on 5 August 2010.

<text>Mario Kart DS is a 2005 kart racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It was released in November 2005 in North America, Europe, and Australia, and on December 8, 2005, in Japan. The game was re-released for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in North America and PAL regions in April 2015 and in Japan in May 2016. The game is the fifth main entry in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, and the first to be playable via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection online service. Like other games in the series, &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; features characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; series and pits them against each other as they race in karts on tracks based on locations in the &quot;Mario&quot; series.

The game received critical acclaim and was praised for its graphics and gameplay as well as its Battle and Versus mode but was criticized for its repetitive single-player mode. &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; received several awards, including Editors&#x27; Choice Awards from &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;G-Phoria&quot;″s Best Handheld Game award, and &quot;IGN&quot;″s Best Racing/Driving Game.

&quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; was the best-selling game in its first month of release and held that position the following month. Overall, &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; is the third best-selling game for the Nintendo DS as of March 2016 and the third best-selling &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game, behind &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;, with 23.6 million units sold worldwide.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; is a racing game in which the player, as a &quot;Mario&quot; franchise character, races in a kart against seven other characters.
Each course features item boxes that the player can drive through to receive a randomly selected item. Some items allow the player to attack other racers to slow them down, while other items can be used to speed up their own kart to pass other racers more easily.

The game features a base roster of the eight playable characters from &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart: Super Circuit&quot;, along with four unlockable characters Daisy, Dry Bones, Waluigi, and R.O.B. for a total of 12. Each character has three unique karts to choose from, each of which vary in attributes such as top speed, acceleration, and handling.

The game features five single-player game modes: Grand Prix, Time Trial, Versus, Battle, and Mission. The Grand Prix and Versus modes require the player to choose an engine class from among 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. The classes serve as difficulty levels—the higher the engine class, the faster all karts go. In addition, a Mirror mode can be unlocked, in which karts use 150cc engines and tracks are horizontally flipped. The game features 32 courses across eight cups, half of which are new tracks and half of which contain tracks from previous &quot;Mario Kart&quot; games (known as Retro Grand Prix).

The game also features a multiplayer mode, in which eight players race each other using the DS Download Play feature for consoles without a cartridge or a multi-card wireless LAN connection. This version has limited courses available, and players with no cartridges play as Shy Guy, a character unavailable in normal play.

Until its discontinuation on May 20, 2014, &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; supported online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, in which up to 4 players could play together.

==Development and release==
Nintendo announced on May 11, 2004, that they planned to release a &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game for the Nintendo DS, releasing some gameplay video footage at the same time. The company offered the game for the public to play for the first time at the 2005 Game Developers Conference, where the game&#x27;s wireless feature was also showcased. &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; was produced by Hideki Konno. The game runs at a consistent 60 frames per second and uses full 3D characters and environments.

&quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; is the first &quot;Mario Kart&quot; iteration to support online play. Konno remarked that although both &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; and the &quot;Halo&quot; series feature online play, he noted that most of the people who use the feature in &quot;Halo&quot; games were &quot;hardcore gamers&quot;. With &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, Konno wanted &quot;everyone to go online, and the technology and time is right for that to happen&quot;. As the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game for the Nintendo DS, the developers tested several features that took advantage of the device&#x27;s bottom touchscreen. They considered letting players place items anywhere on the track instead of just behind their kart. However, the developers found it too confusing because the game already had too many distractions, making it difficult to control where to place items while racing.

In an interview, Konno noted that tracks from previous &quot;Mario Kart&quot; games were included in &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; so that players who played the original &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System would feel more familiar with the DS iteration of the series.

&quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; was released by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS in North America on November 14, 2005, in Australia on November 17, 2005, in Europe in November 2005, and in Japan on December 8, 2005. Nintendo later revealed that &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; would also be sold bundled with a new red-colored Nintendo DS starting on November 28, 2005, along with &quot;a checkered-flag wrist strap, and racing-inspired decals to customize new red handheld&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; was released to critical acclaim; it holds an aggregated score of 91% on Metacritic. Praise focused on the game&#x27;s graphics and gameplay, while criticism targeted its repetitive single-player mode. &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; received Editors&#x27; Choice awards from &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;. The game was nominated by &quot;GameSpot&quot; for several Best of 2005 awards, including Best Multiplayer Game, Best Driving Game, and Best DS Game, winning the lattermost. The game received &quot;G-Phoria&quot;″s Best Handheld Game award. &quot;IGN&quot; gave the game the awards for Best Racing/Driving Game. During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; in the categories of &quot;Racing Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay&quot;.

Several reviews praised the game for living up to the standards set by its predecessors. Finding the game&#x27;s online shortcomings annoying, &quot;GameSpy&quot; still believed that the single-player mode and local wireless gameplay more than made up for them. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; noticed that &quot;the best features of past &quot;Mario Kart&quot; games are back&quot; and work well with the new features in &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, calling the result &quot;the most impressive game to ever hit the Nintendo DS and also the best game in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series&quot;. &quot;X-Play&quot; shared this sentiment, and remarked that the game shattered all of its expectations, making it the &quot;best kart racing game ever released—handheld or otherwise&quot;. &quot;GameZone&quot; also believed that &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; &quot;lives up to its legacy&quot; with its inventive courses, &quot;stellar&quot; multiplayer, and &quot;more replay value than any other racer in its class&quot;. Alejandro K. Brown of &quot;CBS News&quot; appreciated the game&#x27;s unique use of Nintendo DS features, such as its microphone and wireless connectivity. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; named &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; the best DS game of all time, beating out &quot;Pokémon Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; (2nd) and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars&quot; (3rd).

Finding it hard to imagine how Nintendo could make a &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game better than &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; lauded &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;″s gameplay and depth in its design. &quot;GameSpot&quot; called the game a &quot;significant step forward&quot; for the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, partly because it is the first in the series to feature online play. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; remarked that the game &quot;goes the distance&quot; with its single-player and multiplayer modes. &quot;1Up.com&quot; complimented the &quot;surprisingly compelling package&quot;, describing it as a &quot;portable racing game on par with anything ever to appear on a console&quot;. Video game magazine &quot;GamePro&quot; was pleased with the variety of racers, courses, modes, and multiplayer options offered, toting the game as a &quot;must play&quot; for any Nintendo fan and a requisite for any Nintendo DS owner to purchase. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; as the &quot;most complete&quot; &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game, despite a few graphical shortcomings. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; enjoyed the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode, calling it &quot;genuinely practical to play with other people&quot;. British publication &quot;GamesTM&quot; criticized the game for being simply a &quot;polishing of the Mario Kart concept and little else&quot;.

The game was the first for the Nintendo DS to take advantage of the console&#x27;s Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection feature. By the end of its debut week in the United States, 112,000 people purchased the game, of which 52,000 of them had logged onto Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to play against other people over the Internet.

===Sales===
&quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; was the best-selling handheld game in its debut month of November 2005 in the United States. It was the 10th best-selling game of 2008, and the best-selling Nintendo DS game of that year. In Japan, the game sold 224,411 copies in its first week. &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; sold 3,112,363 units as of July 2008, and 3,224,996 copies as of January 2009, making it the sixth best-selling game for the Nintendo DS since the console&#x27;s release. In the United States, it sold 910,000 copies and earned $31 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 23rd highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, or PlayStation Portable in that country. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 26th on a list of greatest Nintendo games. As of March 2016, &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; has sold 23.6 million units worldwide.

<text>Nordenham () is a town in the Wesermarsch district, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is located at the mouth (on the west bank) of the Weser river on the Butjadingen peninsula on the coast of the North Sea. The seaport city of Bremerhaven is located on the other side (east bank) of the river. The Midgard-seaport in Nordenham is the largest private-owned harbor in Germany.

==Geography==

===Geographical location===

Nordenham is located on the West Bank of the Weser River across from Bremerhaven along the river&#x27;s mouth at the North Sea, north of the cities of Bremen and Oldenburg. The local environment is mainly marshland, specifically &quot;Marsch oder Schwemmland&quot;.

===Boroughs===
Nordenham is composed of 35 dorfs, each of which with a history as a separate community: Abbehausen, Abbehauser Groden, Abbehauser Hörne, Abbehauserwisch, Atens, Atenserfeld, Blexen, Blexersande, Blexerwurp, Bulterweg, Butterburg, Einswarden, Ellwürden, Enjebuhr, Esenshamm, Esenshammer Altendeich, Esenshammer Oberdeich, Esenshammergroden, Friedrich-August-Hütte, Grebswarden, Großensiel, Havendorf, Heering, Hoffe, Kloster, Moorseersand, Oberdeich, Phiesewarden, Rahden, Sarve, Schockumerdeich, Schweewarden, Schütting, Tettens, Treuenfeld, and Volkers. Two nearby islands are also part of the town: Langlütjen I und Langlütjen II.

==History==

Nordenham evolved from the town of Atens due to the efforts by merchant Wilhelm Müller who traded cattle and sheep to England in the late 19th century. Some of the oldest parts of the modern town area are the old villages or &quot;Wurtendörfer&quot; (roughly translated as &#x27;terp villages&#x27;) Blexen, Einswarden and Atens. Bishop Willehad, the Northumbrian-born missionary of the Frisians, died in Blexen in the year 789, which is also commonly accepted to be Blexen&#x27;s year of foundation. In 1407, the &quot;Vredeborch&quot; or &quot;Friedeburg&quot; (to be translated as &quot;peace castle&quot;) was erected by the Hanseatic city of Bremen, a castle (although it was probably more a kind of large fortified house) to protect interests against the rebellious inhabitants, the Rüstringer Frisians. The stronghold was destroyed in 1425 and it is possible that the site was later used by a monastery.
Nordenham&#x27;s town founder Wilhelm Müller later built his farm house and a restaurant on the same site. In 1959 those were demolished and the still existing community hall was built there. The town hall was built in 1953 and moved into by the local authority in January 1954.

Between 1499 and 1514, the area was conquered by the County of Oldenburg and in 1813 by the French emperor Napoleon, whose army shot ten local inhabitants at the church in Blexen.

On May 1, 1908 Nordenham was granted 2nd class town rights and since 1955 Nordenham is an independent town in the Wesermarsch district.

Due to government industrialisation programs in the 1960s and 1970s, various industries opened plants in Nordenham. Among others, the main industries are a nuclear power plant near Esenshamm, which politically belongs to the neighbouring borough of Stadland, airplane construction (Premium AEROTEC) and chemical industry. On the &quot;Butjadingen peninsula&quot; outside Nordenham people do dairy farming or work in the tourism industry.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Nordenham is twinned with:
* Peterlee, England, United Kingdom (1981)
* Świnoujście, Poland (1992)
* Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, France (2011)

==Transport==
Due to the town&#x27;s location, transport connections are below par. There is a ferry to Bremerhaven at Blexen, though it has suffered from steady declines in passenger numbers ever since the Weser tunnel some 10 km south of Nordenham opened.
The town is connected to the regional road network by Bundesstraße 212 which intersects with Bundesstraße 437 near the Weser tunnel, offering connections to the A 27 and A 28 motorways.

Nordenham can be reached by RegionalExpress trains; Nordenham railway station sees hourly trains to Bremen. Nordenham has been integrated into the Bremen S-Bahn network since its opening in 2010.

==Economy==
A large part of the population of the town - approximately 4,500 persons - is employed in industrial companies including Prysmian, Norddeutsche Seekabelwerke (NSW), Premium Aerotec, Rhenus Midgard, Kronos Titan, Xstrata and NKT Cables

==Notable people==
*Klaus Dede (1935–2018), journalist and writer
*Roy Horn (1944–2020), German-American magician and entertainer, member of Siegfried &amp; Roy
*Jürgen Rieger (1946–2009), lawyer and politician (NPD)
*Ina Korter (born 1955), politician (Greens) and member of the Landtag
*Tolga Ciğerci (born 1992), footballer, played over 230 games

<text>Cordell Jackson (née Miller; July 15, 1923 – October 14, 2004) was an American guitarist thought to be the first woman to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own rock and roll music label.

==Early life==
She was born Cordell Miller in Pontotoc, Mississippi, where her father led a string band, the Pontotoc Ridge Runners. As a child she learned guitar, piano, harmonica and double bass, and soon began performing in her father&#x27;s band and on radio in Tupelo. In 1943, she graduated from high school and married William Jackson. The couple settled in Memphis, Tennessee, where Jackson worked as a riveter, joined the Fisher Air Craft Band, and wrote songs. After installing recording equipment in her home in 1947, she recorded demo records for Sam Phillips before he set up Sun Records.

==Career==
Jackson founded the Moon Records label in Memphis in 1956, and released her first single &quot;Beboppers Christmas&quot; under the label in the same year. Unable to break into the Sun label&#x27;s stable of male artists, she received the advice and assistance of RCA Records&#x27; Chet Atkins in forming this new label to release her music. She began releasing and promoting on the label singles she recorded in her home studio, serving as engineer, producer and arranger. The artists recorded included her and a small family of early rock and roll, rockabilly, and country music performers she recruited from several Southern states, such as Allen Page, Earl Patterson, and Johnny Tate. In addition to running Moon Records, Jackson worked various day jobs throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including as an interior decorator, D.J., and printer.

Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns and Alex Chilton helped create new interest in her career in the 1980s when they began covering some of her Moon label&#x27;s old singles such as &quot;Dateless Night&quot;, a song she originally wrote in the 1950s for Florida artist Allen Page. Jackson then began playing occasional shows in the 1980s with her signature red Hagstrom electric guitar in Memphis, Hoboken, New York, and Chicago nightclubs. Although she typically performed as a solo artist, she was occasionally supported by other bands, including the A-Bones. She recorded new material on her label with Memphis musicians Colonel Robert Morris and Bob Holden, becoming known as a &quot;rock-and-roll granny&quot; solo guitar instrumentalist. She appeared in 1991 and 1992 on national talk shows like &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and in a Budweiser commercial duelling with rockabilly artist Brian Setzer on guitar. Jackson also produced a contemporary Christian radio show, &quot;Let&#x27;s Keep the Family Together America.&quot;

In the late 1990s, Jackson co-wrote and played with rockabilly icon Colonel Robert Morris in Memphis. Colonel Robert also helped edit the book based on her life and career. She appeared as &quot;Bathroom Lady&quot; in the 1992 &quot;The Gun in Betty Lou&#x27;s Handbag&quot;, and as an extra in &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;!

Her Moon Records label was the oldest continuously operating label in Memphis at the time of her death in 2004. &quot;The 50s Rock on the Moon of Memphis, Tennessee + an Oddity&quot;, a compilation album of the label&#x27;s 1950s singles, was released on vinyl in the early 1980s and was later sold on compact disc until her death in 2004. The original 1950s vinyl singles compiled on that album have been displayed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. She also released video singles through her label in the 1990s, including &quot;Football Widow&quot; and filmmaker Dan Rose&#x27;s production of &quot;The Split.&quot; Her marketing of her own video singles, as opposed to marketing them in multiple-song video collections, is reputed to be another first in her innovative lifetime of doing things her own way, bucking the trends of standard industry practice.

Jackson&#x27;s only solo full-length album to date, &quot;Cordell Jackson — Live in Chicago&quot; was released by Pravda Records in 1997. Information and memorabilia about Jackson is included in the Memphis Rock N&#x27; Soul Museum in Memphis, as well as the National Museum of American History.

==Death==
Jackson died of pancreatic cancer in Memphis on October 14, 2004, aged 81.
