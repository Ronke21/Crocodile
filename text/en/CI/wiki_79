<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Hiratsuka, in the west of Kanagawa Prefecture, part of the Greater Tokyo Area. The club plays in the J1 League, which is the top tier of football in the country. Their home stadium is Hiratsuka Athletics Stadium. &quot;Shonan&quot; refers to a coastal area along Sagami Bay that includes Hiratsuka. &quot;Bellmare&quot; is a portmanteau of the Italian words &quot;bello&quot; and &quot;mare&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful sea&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early years as corporate team (1968–1992) ===
The club was founded in 1968 as &quot;Towa Real Estate SC&quot; in Nasu, Tochigi. They were promoted to the Japan Soccer League (JSL) Division 1 in 1972. They changed their name to &quot;Fujita Kogyo SC&quot; when Towa Estate Development gave up the ownership to their parent company Fujita Industries, which moved the club to Hiratsuka.

They won the JSL three times (including two doubles with the Emperor&#x27;s Cup) between 1977 and 1981. They were nevertheless relegated to the JSL&#x27;s Division 2 in 1990. Although they won the last JSL Division 2 season in 1991–92, the professionalization and formation of the J.League meant they did not meet the new top flight league&#x27;s criteria and the runners-up, Kashima Antlers (formerly Sumitomo), were promoted instead.

===1993: JFL===
In 1993, they adopted new name &quot;Shonan Bellmare&quot;. Their application to the J.League Associate membership was accepted. They played in the former Japan Football League Division 1 and won the league championship. After Hiratsuka City Council committed to finance the refurbishment of the Hiratsuka Stadium to meet the J.League requirements, J.League accepted the club.

===1994–1997: Golden era===
The club was forced to change their name to Bellmare Hiratsuka because J.League required the participants to designate only one city or town as their hometown and include its name in the club names at that time. The club initially struggled to cope with the J.League opponents and finished 11th out of 12 in the first stage of the 1994 season. However, they came back in the second stage and finished 2nd. With this momentum, the club won the 1994–1995 Emperor&#x27;s Cup. This title qualified Bellmare for the 1996 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, which they won by beating Iraq&#x27;s Al Talaba in the final. Hidetoshi Nakata joined the team in 1995 and they also successfully recruited Brazilian-born Wagner Lopes and influential Korean international Hong Myung-bo. This is arguably the most successful period of the club.

===1998–1999: Difficult period===
Four Bellmare players were selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. They were Nakata, Lopes, Hong (for South Korea) and a goalkeeper Nobuyuki Kojima. However, as Nakata left for Italian club Perugia just after the World Cup, the club&#x27;s fortune started to decline. The main sponsor Fujita decided to discontinue the financial support in 1999 due to their own financial difficulties. It forced the club to release some highly paid players including Lopes, Hong and Kojima. They finished bottom of J1 in 1999 and were relegated to J2.

===2000–2009: J2 League===
The club made a new start. The ownership was transferred to a community-owned organisation. They also changed their name to Shonan Bellmare as J.League allowed them to enlarge their designated hometowns to include several cities and towns surrounding Hiratsuka. The club&#x27;s performance on the pitch has not been strong and they have not been serious contenders for the promotion to J1 so far.

A J1 comeback in 2010, if they are able to achieve promotion, will be the first without Fujita as their sponsor. Although for a time they refused to consider their history as the championship-winning Fujita corporate team in their current history, this year they celebrated the club&#x27;s 40-year anniversary in 2009 as deduced from the badge in their Web site.

On 5 December 2009, Shonan returned to J1 as third-place finishers in 2009 seasons.

===2010–present: Return to J1 League===
The club returned to the J1 in 2010, but injured one after another and J2 was relegated after leaving four games.
In the end, he won 21 consecutive league games. It was the worst record of J1 at that time.
After that, the team will be repeatedly demoted to J2 and promoted to J1.

In recent years, the team has been steadily improving.
In 2014, the team made good progress in the J2, winning 14 consecutive games from the opening. The team was defeated by Ehime FC in the 15th round, but after that they lost 21 battles. J1 automatic promotion is confirmed. As a result, he won the J2 with 31 wins, 8 draws, 3 losses and 101 points in the 2014 season.
In 2016, in the J1, Shonan Bellmare was the final result in 8th place, and it was the first time for J1 to remain in history. In addition, at the EAFF E-1 Football Championship 2015 held in August, Wataru Endo, who was on the team at the time, participated as a representative of Japan.
In 2018, won the J.League Cup. It was the first time for Shonan Bellmare to win three major titles since winning the 74th Emperor&#x27;s Cup in the Bellmare Hiratsuka.

On the operational side, there was some report that the club fell into excess debt of more than 100 million yen in February 2012, and in the worst case the club itself could be dissolved (the actual amount of excess debt was 82.68 million yen). However, the debt insolvency was resolved by two capital increases. 
In April 2018, SANEI ARCHITECTURE PLANNING, which was the largest shareholder of Shonan Bellmare, established &quot;Merudia RIZAP Shonan Sports Partners&quot; in collaboration with RIZAP GROUP. The new company acquired a 50% stake in Shonan Bellmare. RIZAP GROUP intends to invest 1 billion yen in Bellmare over the next three years. 

== Rivalries ==
Historically the Shonan area was part of a pre-modern province, Sagami Province, whereas Yokohama and Kawasaki were part of Musashi Province, hence Bellmare&#x27;s intraprefectural rivalries with Yokohama F. Marinos, Yokohama FC and Kawasaki Frontale are based on the hard-working port cities of South Musashi as opposed to the more laid-back attitude of Sagami.

<text>Todd Jason Replogle (born 1969) is an American video game programmer best known as the co-creator of the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; series. He wrote six 2D action games for MS-DOS released as shareware by Apogee Software between 1990 and 1993. This includes &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem II&quot;, which are multidirectional scrolling platform games.

Replogle worked as a programmer on a team of developers for &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, published in 1996. One of the first major 2.5D games following &quot;Doom&quot;, it used the Build engine by Ken Silverman.

After &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, Replogle started some technical experimentation into what would later become &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;. He retired from the gaming industry in 1997. The last game Replogle was known to be working on was called &quot;Mr. Fist&quot;. This was something he showed to 3D Realms, but it was never published.

==Personal life==
Replogle graduated from Soquel High School in Soquel, California as a member of the class of 1987. He lives with his wife Malisa and son Tyler in Chonburi, Thailand.

<text>Pauline Polaire (stage name of Giulietta Gozzi) was an Italian actress.

Giuletta Gozzi was born in Ravenna, Italy, on 30 June 1904. She was the niece of the Italian actress Hesperia, née Olga Mambelli. She died in Rome on 11 February 1986.

The similarity of her name with that of French actress Polaire has given rise to some confusion in their filmographies in sites specialized in cinema.

<text>William Estes Nipper (; born October 21, 1978), known professionally as Will Estes, is an American actor. He is known for his role from 2010 to 2024 on CBS police drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; as Jameson &quot;Jamie&quot; Reagan, a New York City Police Department officer and the youngest son of the police commissioner, played by Tom Selleck. Prior to that role, he starred as J.J. Pryor, on the NBC drama &quot;American Dreams&quot;.

==Early life==

Estes was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, where he currently resides.

==Career==

Estes&#x27; break-out movie role was Seaman Ronald &#x27;Rabbit&#x27; Parker on &quot;U-571&quot;. Early in his career, he did many commercials including Fruit of the Loom and numerous guest starring roles in series like &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; and &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;.

Estes landed his first major role in a television series when he was chosen out of 700 other children to play Will McCollough (essentially the &quot;Timmy&quot; role) in the syndicated &quot;New Lassie&quot; series, which ran from 1989 to 1992. Since then, he has had many starring roles in television series and he dabbled in the music video industry. He has appeared in Meat Loaf&#x27;s video &quot;Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are&quot; (from &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot;) and was in Bon Jovi&#x27;s video &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; with Shiri Appleby.

In 2000, according to a 2005 &quot;Soap Talk&quot; interview, Estes was asked by Jon Bon Jovi to be in his music video after he worked with Estes on &quot;U-571&quot;. Estes did most of his own stunts in the video.

Estes had a leading role in the Fox series &quot;Reunion&quot;. The series followed six best friends over the course of 20 years, with each episode marking the next successive year. When the group meets up for its 20th high school reunion, one turns up dead at the end of the night. In late 2005, Fox announced that the series would be canceled because of low ratings and the identity of the murderer would not be revealed.

Estes portrayed Jack Kerouac in the 2007 short film &quot;Luz Del Mundo&quot;, written by Ty Roberts and David Trimble, directed by Ty Roberts, and produced by Ryan McWhirter and John Pitts. He has also appeared in a couple of photographs, in the books &quot;Hollywood Splash&quot; and &quot;Men Before 10 AM Too&quot;. He was nominated four times for one award, the Young Artist Awards for &quot;The New Lassie&quot; and &quot;Kirk&quot;.

Since 2010, Estes has been playing Jamie Reagan in the police procedural television series &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

<doc id="1071123" wikidata="Q360424" url="?curid=1071123" title="Adobe Premiere Pro">
<text>Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline-based non-linear video editing software developed by Adobe Inc., distributed as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. Primarily aimed at professional video editing, the program also provides an advanced set of tools for creating special effects and visual effects. Its derivative version, Adobe Premiere Elements, is targeted at the consumer market and features a more accessible interface. Initially released in 2003, it succeeded Adobe Premiere, which was first introduced in 1991.

CNN was one of the early adopters of Adobe Premiere Pro. In 2007, certain departments of the BBC also adopted the software. Premiere Pro has been used in the editing of multiple notable films and series, as well as projects such as Madonna&#x27;s Confessions Tour.

== History ==
===Original Adobe Premiere===

The original version of Adobe Premiere was developed by Adobe Systems. It was first launched in 1991. Premiere was one of the first computer non-linear editing systems. The first version for Mac was released in 1991, and the first version for Microsoft Windows was released in September 1993. Its final version was released in 2002.

The project began at SuperMac Technology as ReelTime, a QuickTime-based video editor for its VideoSpigot video capture card. SuperMac engineer Randy Ubillos created a working demo of ReelTime in about 10 weeks while QuickTime was still in beta. The software project was acquired by Adobe Systems in August 1991 and was renamed Adobe Premiere. Ubillos also left SuperMac to join Adobe.

Premiere was the second of many QuickTime-based video editors on the market. As a result, its ability to import new video formats could also be upgraded by updating to a newer compatible version of QuickTime. However, it was limited to processing video and images that were 1024 pixels wide, or less.

Premiere included 24 transition effects and a plug-in architecture that was compatible with some Photoshop filters.

Premiere was based on ReelTime, a product acquired from SuperMac Technologies Inc. and was one of the first computer-based NLEs (non-linear editing system), with its first release on Mac in 1991. Adobe briefly abandoned the Mac platform after version 6 of Premiere. Up until version Premiere Pro 2.0 (CS2), the software packaging featured a galloping horse, in a nod to Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s work, &quot;Sallie Gardner at a Gallop&quot;.

===Release of Adobe Premiere Pro===
Adobe Premiere Pro was launched in 2003. It was a re-written version of Premiere. Premiere Pro refers to versions released in 2003 and later, whereas Premiere refers to the earlier releases.

== Features ==
Premiere Pro supports high-resolution video editing at up to 10,240 × 8,192 resolution, up to 32 bits per channel color, in both RGB and YUV. Audio sample-level editing, VST audio plug-in support, and 5.1 surround sound mixing are available. The plug-in architecture enables it to import and export formats, supporting a wide variety of video and audio file formats and codecs on both MacOS and Windows. When used with CineForm Neo, it supports 3D editing with the ability to view 3D material using 2D monitors while making individual left and right eye adjustments.

Premiere Pro can be used to import video, audio and graphics, and to create new, edited versions of video that can be exported to the medium and format necessary for distribution. When creating videos using Premiere Pro, various videos, still images and audio files can be edited together. Titles and motion graphics can be added to videos and filters can be applied along with other effects.

Premiere Pro was used in films such as &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, &quot;Dust to Glory&quot; (for video capture processing), and also in places such as Madonna&#x27;s Confessions Tour.

=== Workflow integration ===
;* After Effects
: Through Adobe Dynamic Link, compositions from Adobe After Effects may be imported and played back directly on the Premiere Pro timeline. The After Effects composition can be modified, and after switching back to Premiere Pro, the clip will update with the changes. Likewise, Premiere Pro projects can be imported into After Effects. Clips can be copied between the two applications while preserving most clip attributes. Premiere Pro also supports many After Effects plug-ins.

;* Premiere Rush
:Video projects in Premiere Rush can be opened in Premiere Pro to make edits and open windows that are more complex.

;* Photoshop
: Adobe Photoshop files can be opened directly from Premiere Pro to be edited in Photoshop. Any changes will immediately be updated when the Photoshop file is saved and focus returns to Premiere Pro.

;* Illustrator
: Adobe Illustrator files can also be opened directly in Premiere Pro. These files are generally vector files, which means that they are mathematical paths that can expand or decrease with any zoom level.

;* Adobe Story, OnLocation and Prelude
: The Premiere Pro workflow takes advantage of metadata in the script of video production. The script is created in or brought into Adobe Story, then passed to Adobe OnLocation to capture footage and attach any relevant metadata from the script to that footage. Finally, in Premiere Pro, speech recognition can match the audio to the dialogue from the script in the metadata. Clips can be searched based on their dialogue in Premiere Pro, and can be sent to Adobe Encore to make searchable web DVDs. Encore was discontinued with the release of Adobe Creative Cloud. Adobe Prelude replaces OnLocation in CS6 and above.
:* Others
:There are other integration functions, such as Edit in Adobe Audition, Dynamic Link to Encore, and Reveal in Adobe Bridge. In June 2020, Adobe launched a stock audio offering for Premiere Pro users.

Various extensions are available for Premiere Pro, provided by third parties. These include music libraries, graphic elements, and workflow improvements. Extensions open in their own panel within the Premiere Pro interface.

Plug-ins can be created for Premiere Pro to add additional functionality. Plug-ins can serve several purposes, such as video and audio effects and adding additional codec and hardware support. They can be created specifically for Premiere Pro, or they can be created for After Effects and still run on Premiere Pro. Popular plug-in suites include Red Giant, BorisFX, and NewBlue.

== Adobe Premiere family ==
The Adobe Premiere family is a group of applications and services made by Adobe Inc. for the use of professional non-linear video editing. Several features of the Adobe Premiere family are non-linear video editing, metadata and ingest logging, media output encoding, and more.

=== Current applications ===
* Dynamic Link is a workflow that integrates After Effects with Premiere Pro and with the discontinued Encore, allowing files to be transferred between the two without re-rendering.
*Elements Organizer is the digital asset management app for Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements. It is able to organize all photos and video projects all in one place.
*Media Encoder is a tool to output video files in order support more audiences and to lessen the file size.
* Premiere Elements is a video editing software application published by Adobe Systems. It is a scaled-down version of Premiere Pro and is tailored to novice editors and consumers.

Its main competitors are Final Cut Express (no longer sold), AVS Video Editor, PowerDirector, Pinnacle Studio, Sony Vegas Movie Studio, Sony Vegas, Corel VideoStudio, and iMovie. Unlike many of its competitors, Premiere Elements can handle unlimited video and audio tracks, with multiple keyframe effects applied to each clip, as well as picture-in-picture and chroma key capabilities. It also supports many third-party plug-ins for additional features, including Premiere Pro plug-ins, After Effects plug-ins, and VST effects. It can create bars and tone and a countdown leader, just like Premiere Pro. The program also features real-time video rendering which allows the user to instantly preview edits made to the video timeline. It is available for Windows and MacOS.
* Premiere Pro is a timeline-based video editing software application developed by Adobe Inc. and published as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud licensing program. First launched in 2003, Adobe Premiere Pro is a successor of Adobe Premiere (first launched in 1991).

*Premiere Express was a rich Internet application for simple editing of digital video files. The release was announced on February 21, 2007. The program itself is served as a free tool for users of YouTube, Photobucket, and MTV.com. As Adobe Systems allowed websites to contact them to request Express, YouTube received it on their website as a way of remixing videos on a member&#x27;s YouTube account. Known as &quot;YouTube&#x27;s Video Remixer&quot;, it was found on TestTube at . It was later taken down.
*Premiere Limited Edition (LE) was a video editor for novice video editors and hobbyists. It contains most of the features of the professional version but with fewer and simpler options. It was instead replaced by Premiere Elements in September 2004.
* SpeedGrade is a tool for performing color corrections and developing looks for Premiere projects. SpeedGrade was discontinued on August 22, 2017, but can still be used by subscribers at the time. Features from SpeedGrade are now found in the Lumetri Color Correction feature in Premiere Pro.
* Story was a screenwriting and film/TV pre-production online application which integrates with the Premiere family. It allows users to create scripts for movies and TV shows.
* Ultra is a discontinued chroma key compositing app, which removes the background of video usually recorded on a blue or green screen and combines it with another video background. Ultra was only available in the CS3 package. It was later incorporated into Premiere Elements and Visual Communicator. Later versions of Premiere Pro and After Effects have had built-in chroma key compositing features.

<text>The Remote Imaging Protocol and its associated Remote Imaging Protocol Script language, RIP&quot;scrip&quot;, is a graphics language that provides a system for sending vector graphics over low-bandwidth links, notably modems. It was originally created by Jeff Reeder, Jim Bergman, and Mark Hayton of TeleGrafix Communications in Huntington Beach, California to enhance bulletin board systems and other applications.

RIPscrip was introduced in 1992 and consisted of ASCII-text descriptions of vector-drawn graphics and images, along with facilities to create menus and clickable buttons. These were sent from the BBS instead of the more common ANSI color-coded text-mode screens, and were interpreted on the user&#x27;s end by a RIP-enabled terminal program such as TeleGrafix&#x27;s own RIPTerm. Lines of text appeared in one display, graphics in another. RIPscrip could not be used as the basis for a complete GUI, as it included no text editing system.

RIPscript 1.5x was a text-based wrapper around the Borland Graphics Interface (BGI). Drawing primitives all relied on the BGI, fonts were limited to those provided by the BGI (*.CHR). RIPscrip icon (.ICN) file format was that of the BGI getImage() and putImage() functions. The choice to include the BGI flood fill function was considered by many to be a mistake, as third-party implementations of the RIPscrip protocol often failed to implement Bezier curves the same way Telegrafix had, thus leading to the flood fill leaking out of the intended object and filling the entire screen. Telegrafix never published their Bezier algorithm or a complete RIPscrip specification, thus forcing developers wishing to implement RIPscrip to purchase Telegrafix&#x27;s expensive developers kit, containing pre-compiled BGI wrapper DLLs.

Early versions of RIPscrip were tightly tied to the EGA 640×350 EGA standard and had a decidedly MS-DOS-like feel. Later versions provided resolution independence (after a fashion), expanded color palettes, and the ability to work over telnet for Internet access. By this time public access to the World Wide Web caused interest in bulletin board systems to rapidly decline, resulting in the eventual end of RIPscrip development and the company. Although RIPscrip 2.0 was released and 3.0 was planned, the most common version of RIPscrip in actual use was the 1.5x series.

Vector image standards which are present on the World Wide Web today that draw some similarities include Adobe Flash and SVG.

==Description==
RIPscrip is a simple page description language similar in concept to PostScript or HPGL. Graphics output is described in a series of text instructions, which have been heavily optimized in RIPscrip to be as short as possible in order to save transmission time.:

A RIPscrip aware terminal watches for lines beginning with a special RIPscrip escape character and interprets the following instructions, passing along non-escaped lines to the text output screen. RIPscrip used separate text and graphics displays, one each, and although it could draw text into the graphics screen, the speed of doing so was such that it was not useful for general text output or editing. Generally, a system using RIPscrip would use the graphics screen for presenting menus, with conventional editing and input taking place in the text screen. RIPscrip would not normally be used to build a conventional GUI with multiple windows or mouse-driven text editing, for instance.

The RIPscrip escape character was the exclamation mark, codice_1. RIPscrip commands were always preceded by the vertical bar, codice_2, followed by a single-letter command. Later versions optionally inserted digits between the vertical bar and command letter, indicating what version of RIPscrip was needed to interpret that command, allowing older terminals to quickly filter out non-supported features. A common command one would find in a RIPscrip file would be to set the size and position of the text output window, typically something like codice_3, with the &quot;w&quot; command for &quot;window&quot;, followed by a series of numbers indicating its location and size.

RIPscrip commands could be stacked together on a single line for compactness. For instance, codice_4 sets up the standard graphics viewport output window with codice_5, erases any existing image with codice_6 (redundant as the window was just reset), sets the color to green with codice_7, and then draws text with codice_8. More complex drawings would normally be built out of a series of stacked commands, each one representing some part of the overall drawing to be created, breaking it into logical groups.

In addition to basic graphics like lines and circles, RIPscrip also included commands for interactive objects, notably buttons. The codice_9 command drew a button into the display at a specified location with and optional icon, hot key, and label. When the button was pressed with the mouse or hot key, the last parameter, the &quot;host command&quot; string, was sent back to the server. In this way the RIPscrip author could produce graphical menus for commands in the system, perhaps one that lists all the available forums by sending the text &quot;FPA&quot; for &quot;forums, public, all&quot;. These strings would be different for every host software, and also tend to be somewhat different from system to system.

<text>SS &quot;Europa, laterSS &quot;Liberté IMO 5607332, was an ocean liner built for the German shipping company Norddeutsche Lloyd (NDL) to work the transatlantic sea route. Launched in 1928, she and her sister ship, , were the two most advanced, high-speed steam turbine ocean vessels of their day, with both earning the Blue Riband.

After World War II, French line &quot;Compagnie Générale Transatlantique&quot; was awarded the &quot;Europa&quot; as a war prize to replace the destroyed &quot;&quot;, which had caught fire and capsized at her moorings while interned by the United States in New York City. &quot;Europa&quot; was refitted at Le Havre and rechristened the Liberté, serving until the arrival of the in 1961 as the premier liner in the &quot;Compagnie&#x27;s&quot; fleet. She was laid up in 1962 and scrapped at La Spezia, Italy, in 1963.

==History==
===Construction===
&quot;Europa&quot; was built in 1928 with her sister ship to be the second 50,000–gross ton North German Lloyd liner. They both were powered with advanced high-speed steam turbine engines and and a low streamlined profile.

&quot;Europa&quot; and her slightly larger sister ship were designed to have a cruising speed of 27.5 knots, allowing an Atlantic crossing time of 5 days. This enabled Norddeutsche Lloyd to run regular weekly crossings with two ships, an operation that previously required three.
The &quot;Europa&quot; was launched at Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard, Hamburg on Wednesday, August 15, 1928. &quot;Europa&quot; was intended to be completed in spring 1929. However, on the morning of 26 March 1929, a fire broke out while still at the equipment dock. The fire raged all day and was only brought under control in the evening. The ship&#x27;s turbines were damaged heavily in addition to significant damage to the remainder of the ship. After long discussions between builder and shipping company, it was decided to repair the ship. Within eleven months the ship was finished and completed on February 22, 1930. The cause of the fire has never been clearly identified.

===Blue Riband===
&quot;Europa&quot; made her maiden voyage to New York on 19 March 1930 taking the westbound Blue Riband from with the average speed of 27.91 knots and a crossing time of 4 days, 17 hours and 6 minutes. During the voyage many of her passengers were disturbed by the soot coming out of &quot;Europa&quot;&#x27;s low funnels. The problem was corrected by raising the funnels by 15 feet, though decreasing her low profile. After they were raised, there were no more complaints. She held the Riband until &quot;Bremen&quot; recaptured it in June 1933.

===Aircraft===
Like &quot;Bremen&quot;, &quot;Europa&quot; had a small seaplane launched from a catapult on her upper deck between the funnels. The airplane flew from the ship to a landing at the seaplane port in Blexen.

The catapult was removed from both &quot;Bremen&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot; after a few years of service.

===World War II===
&quot;Europa&quot; was inactive for most of World War II. There were plans to use her as a transport in Operation Sea Lion, the intended invasion of Great Britain, and later conversion to an aircraft carrier. None of these plans came to pass, and in 1945, she was captured by the Allies and used as a troopship, sailing as the USS &quot;Europa&quot; (AP-177). The United States claimed the ship as a war prize on 8 May 1945 and gave the vessel to the US Navy, which commissioned &quot;Europa&quot; 25 August 1945. &quot;Europa&quot; cleared Bremerhaven on 11 September 1945 for Southampton, England, where she loaded 4,500 homeward-bound American troops, arriving in New York City on 24 September. After alteration to increase her troop-carrying capacity, she made two voyages to Southampton to bring US servicemen home to the United States. She sailed from New York once more, on 15 March 1946, bound for Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands, and Bremerhaven, where she moored on 24 March.

&quot;Europa&quot; suffered from small fires caused by the removal of the ship&#x27;s original high-quality fittings and installation of inferior replacements to compensate for material shortages in the war effort. Also, several serious hull cracks were discovered. The vessel was decommissioned on 2 May 1946 and delivered to the State Department on 8 June 1946. She was later transferred to France in partial payment of war reparations.

===French Line===

After World War II French line &quot;Compagnie Générale Transatlantique&quot; was awarded &quot;Europa&quot; as a war prize to replace the destroyed , which had caught fire and capsized at her moorings while interned by the United States in New York City. &quot;Europa&quot; was taken to Le Havre for refitting – which proved fraught with difficulties. On December 8, 1946, a storm caused her to break free from her moorings and she collided with the wreck of &quot;&quot;, causing significant damage to her hull. She was raised in April 1947 and towed to the Ateliers et Chantiers de Saint-Nazaire Penhoët shipyard in Saint-Nazaire to complete her refitting. She suffered some further damage when the ship caught fire once again in October 1949, resulting in damage to some of her passenger space. Finally, on August 2, 1950, wearing CGT black-topped red funnels in place of NDL yellow, she made her maiden voyage to New York under her new name, Liberté. After five years and two near disasters the crossing was uneventful. Sailing the Le Havre – New York route, and she went on to serve as the premier transatlantic liner in the French Line fleet until the arrival of the 66,000-ton in 1961. &quot;Liberté&quot; was laid up in 1962 and scrapped at La Spezia, Italy, in 1963.

&quot;Liberté&quot; was featured prominently in the Jane Russell film &quot;The French Line&quot;. &quot;Liberté&quot; made an appearance in the opening credits of the 1953 film &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, as well as the 1954 classic film &quot;Sabrina&quot;, starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, in the final scenes of the film.
==Fate==
&quot;Liberté&quot; was scrapped in La Spezia, Italy, in 1964.

<doc id="1071139" wikidata="Q599401" url="?curid=1071139" title="Mighty Jack">
<text>is a tokusatsu science fiction/espionage/action TV series. Created by Japanese effects wizard Eiji Tsuburaya, the show was produced by Tsuburaya Productions and was broadcast on Fuji TV from April 6, 1968 to June 29, 1968, with a total of 13 one-hour episodes. The music for the episodes was done by Isao Tomita and Kunio Miyauchi.

Reportedly, Eiji Tsuburaya considered this series his masterwork because the focus was on the people, rather than on the vehicles and special effects (the show never had any monsters or aliens, as his more famous shows &quot;Ultra Q&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot; and &quot;Ultra Seven&quot; did). This focus on the people was similar to the works of Gerry Anderson, of which Tsuburaya was a big fan. The Mighty Jack mecha/HQ featured in this series also has some similarities to Tsuburaya&#x27;s previous TV masterpiece, &quot;Ultra Seven&quot;.

Even for the original series of 13 one hour-long episodes, the ratings were low. The follow-up series, &quot;Fight! Mighty Jack&quot;, fared better in the ratings, perhaps because of its inclusion of monsters and aliens, rather than purely human evildoers like Q.

The insignia of the titular heroic spy team has also become the current logo for Tsuburaya Productions.

==Plot==
&quot;Mighty Jack&quot; is the name of both a top-secret international peacekeeping organization&#x27;s 11 agents, and the technologically advanced flying submarine &quot;Mighty-Gō&quot; they use to fight the plots of the terrorist organization &quot;Q&quot;.

* Noriaka Inoue
* Mitsuru Ōya

* Annu Mari
* Eijirō Yanagi

== Episodes ==
== &quot;Fight! Mighty Jack&quot; ==
The more comical sequel series, , aired on the same network from July 6 to December 28, 1968, with a total of 26 half-hour episodes, equaling the original in length.

This series has several humorous references to the early Ultra Series.

* The opening scene of the series (with a reverse paint-swirling effect forming &quot;MJ&quot; before a burst of red envelops the scene, with a yellow &quot;Fight! Mighty Jack&quot; superimposed) is almost exactly like that of &quot;Ultraman&quot;
* One episode of this series is quite notable, as it features a comical guest appearance by Kohji Moritsugu, who played Dan Moroboshi, the alter-ego of Ultra Seven, poking fun at his popular role. He plays a mechanic, who, in one scene, looked as though he was about to transform into Ultra Seven by pulling the Ultra Eye from his pocket to put it on, but the red object he slowly pulls from his pocket is actually a small wrench, with which he gets right to work on fixing a machine.

== &quot;Mighty Jack&quot; in the U.S. ==
In 1986, American producer Sandy Frank took the first and sixth episodes of &quot;Mighty Jack&quot; (without any of the episodes that were released in between or afterward) and combined them into a dubbed feature-length film of the same name. The movie gained its widest exposure in the United States when it was shown as a &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode on Comedy Central (originally shown on the UHF station KTMA TV 23 during the show&#x27;s KTMA season).

<doc id="1071141" wikidata="Q3507544" url="?curid=1071141" title="South Granville, Vancouver">
<text>Established in 1997, South Granville (or less commonly &quot;Uptown&quot;) is an upscale Business Improvement Area (BIA) and neighbourhood south of Vancouver&#x27;s downtown core, centred along Granville Street and bordered by the neighbourhoods of Kitsilano, Fairview and Shaughnessy.

Separated from Downtown by False Creek, the area runs along Granville Street from the south side of the Granville Street Bridge up to 16th Ave, where storefronts are replaced by the residences and hedges of Shaughnessy.

1907 has been decided as the unofficial birth year of the neighbourhood. In that year Richard Marpole drew up plans for Shaughnessy Heights, the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s newest subdivision south of 16th Ave, pitched as an alternative to the then-upscale West End (&quot;Blueblood Alley&quot;). This is now known as &quot;First Shaughnessy&quot;, or simply Shaughnessy. That same year, what was once Centre Street was given its present name, Granville Street, as the portion north of the bridge already bore that name. In 2007, the South Granville BIA commemorated the neighbourhood&#x27;s centennial by encasing a state-of-the-art, stainless steel time capsule in concrete and stone under the entrance of the historic Stanley Theatre.

As well as being a fast-growing neighbourhood of residences, shops and restaurants, South Granville is home to a vibrant arts and culture scene. The neighbourhood contains a strip, between Broadway and the foot of the Granville Bridge, known as &quot;Gallery Row&quot; which is home to a number of art galleries: Bau-Xi Gallery, Douglas Reynolds Gallery, Ian Tan Gallery, Petley Jones Gallery, Uno Langmann. The South Granville Gallery Association (SGGA) represents the leading fine art galleries on Gallery Row. Further south, the neighbourhood is home to the historic Stanley Theatre, built in 1931. Once a popular cinema in its early days, the Stanley Theatre is now the stage of the Arts Club Theatre Company and the Industrial Alliance Stage.

<doc id="1071147" wikidata="Q1093773" url="?curid=1071147" title="Twelve Bens">
<text>The Twelve Bens or Twelve Pins, also called the Benna Beola (), is a mountain range of mostly sharp-peaked quartzite summits and ridges in the Connemara National Park in County Galway, in the west of Ireland. The widest definition of the range includes the Garraun Complex to the north as well as several isolated peaks to the west, and is designated a Special Area of Conservation.

The highest point is Benbaun at . The range is a popular location for hill-walking activities with the 16–kilometre 8–9 hour Glencoaghan Horseshoe, considered one of the best ridge-walks in Ireland. Topographically, the range is partnered with the Maumturks range to the east of the Inagh valley (a Western Way route); and both share a common geology being largely composed of metamorphic marine rocks, being predominantly resistant quartzite but with deposits of schists in the valleys (known as &quot;Connemara Dalradian&quot; rocks).

==Naming==
&quot;Ben&quot; is an anglicized form of the Irish word &quot;binn&quot;, meaning &quot;peak&quot;. According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, &quot;An odd thing about the Twelve Bens of Connemara is that nobody seems to know exactly which are the twelve peaks in question&quot;, and noting that there are almost 20 peaks with &quot;Ben&quot; or &quot;Binn&quot; in their name. Tempan notes that term &quot;twelve peaks&quot; can be at least dated to the Irish historian Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh, whose writings in 1684 said: &quot;On the north-west of Ballynahinsy [Ballynahinch], are the twelve high mountaines of Bennabeola, called by marriners the twelve stakes [stacks], being the first land they discover as they come from the maine [sea]&quot;, but he did not list them.

The most common list of the twelve peaks in question are the peaks with an elevation above 500 metres in the core range, and that are not considered subsidiary peaks (e.g. they have a non-trivial prominence, and have been traditionally noted as peaks on historic maps, per below).

Tempan notes the issue of &quot;twelve&quot; does not arise in the Irish language name as they are simply labelled &quot;Na Beanna Beola&quot;, which translates as &quot;the peaks of Beola&quot;. Beola was a leader of the Fir Bolg, and a giant; his name appears in that of the Connemara village Toombeola.

==Geography==

The Twelve Bens range is a core massif of 22 peaks above in elevation, centred around the highest peak in the range, Benbaun . To the north of this core massif lies the separate subsidiary massif of the Garraun Complex with 9 peaks around Garraun . To the west of the core massif lies 7 other isolated or subsidiary &quot;outlier&quot; peaks, thus giving a total of 38 Bens with an elevation above 100 metres.

While the Bens are not as high as those of the ranges in County Kerry (e.g. MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks and the Mountains of the Dingle Peninsula), their rocky peaks and ridges contrast with the surrounding sea-level landscape (unlike Kerry, there are no mountain-passes in Connemara), and give the range an imposing feel.

The range is bounded by the Inagh Valley and the R344 road to the east, while the N59 road (or the &quot;Clifden Road&quot;), circles and bounds the core massif (and most of the outliers), from the southerly, westerly and northerly directions. The Garraun Complex lies to the north of the N59 road at Kylemore Lough.

===Core massif===
The 22 peaks in the core massif of the Twelve Bens range naturally split into three sections:

The core massif is also known for its deep glaciated U-shaped valleys, around which groups of Bens lie in a &quot;horseshoe formation&quot;:

==Geology==

The core massif of the Twelve Bens range is largely composed of metamorphic marine rocks, being predominantly resistant quartzite but with deposits of schists in the valleys (known as &quot;Connemara Dalradian&quot; rocks).

These rocks derive from sediments that were deposited in a warm shelf sea some 700 to 550 million years ago (e.g. Precambrian-Cambrian). Movements in the Earth&#x27;s crust, and the closure of the Iapetus Ocean, transformed these sediments into crystalline schists that lie underneath the base of the mountain range, which local erosion and uplift then brought to the surface. The summits of the core massif (and some outliers) are made of weather-resistant quartzite, while the sides of the peaks are composed of schists and grey marbles.

In contrast, the mountains to the north of the core Twelve Bens massif, the Garraun Complex, have a different type of geology, that is composed of gneiss and different forms of sandstones and mudstones.

Scattered throughout the range are parts of gabbro (Doughruagh and Currywongaun), mica schist (Muckanaght), and outcrops of marble (south of Kylemore Lough).

The final Ice Age, circa 10,000 years ago, also sculpted the landscape leaving behind deposits of sand and gravel; there are widespread boulder-clay and erratic boulders across the range.

==Special Area of Conservation (SAC)==

The entire Twelve Bens range (including the Garraun Complex) is a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) (Site Code:002031), as selected for a range of habitats and species listed under the Annex I / II of the E.U. Habitats Directive. The items of note on the SAC habitats list includes: Oligotrophic Waters, Alpine Heaths, Active Blanket Bogs, remnants of Oak Woodland, Rhynchosporion Vegetation, and Siliceous Scree and Rocky Slopes; while the species list includes: Freshwater Pearl Mussel, Atlantic Salmon, Otter, and Slender Naiad. In addition, the 16,163-hectare site includes a some of the rarer &quot;Red Data Book&quot; species of plant. The SAC directive on the range describes it as &quot;One of the largest and most varied sites of conservation interest in Ireland&quot;.

==Climbing==
The range is popular with hill walkers, fell runners, and rock climbers,
===Hill walking===

The &quot;Irish Times&quot; outdoors correspondent, John G. Dwyer, said of the Twelve Bens, &quot;These are true kickass mountains, with criminally stunning views [..]&quot;.
The 8–9 hour Glencoaghan Horseshoe is noted as providing some of the &quot;most exhilarating mountaineering in Ireland&quot;, and is called &quot;a true classic&quot; by guidebook authors. Other similar distanced &quot;horseshoe&quot; loop walks are the 19–kilometre 10–12 hour &quot;Owenglin Horseshoe&quot;, the 15–kilometre 8–9 hour &quot;Gleninagh Horseshoe&quot;, and the 14–kilometre 6–7 hour &quot;Glencorbet Horseshoe&quot;.

An even more serious undertaking is the &quot;Twelve Bens Challenge&quot;, climbing all 12 Bens in a single 24-hour day.

===Rock climbing===

The Twelve Bens have a number of rock climbing locations, the most notable of which is in the Gleann Eighneach valley at the eastern spur of Benncorr (from Binn an tSaighdiúra to Bencorrbeg; also called &quot;Carrot Ridge&quot;). The climbs vary from Diff (D) to Very Severe (VS) and range from 150 metres to 320 metres in length, with notable routes being Carrot Ridge (275m D), and Seventh Heaven (330m HS).

In addition, the large easterly corrie between the summits of Derryclare and the summit of Bencorr, known as (meaning &quot;wood of the big corrie&quot;), also contains several large 200 metre multi-pitch graded rock climbs at grades of Diff (D) to Very Diff (VD), the most notable of which is &quot;The Knave&quot; (VD, 225 m); and the smaller corrie between the summit of Bencorr and the summit of Bencorr North Top, known as &quot;Log an Choire Bhig&quot;, (&quot;wood of the small corrie&quot;), has a number of shorter but harder climbs including &quot;Corner Climb&quot; (VS 4c, 30 m).

==List of peaks==

The following is a download from the &quot;MountainViews Online Database&quot;, who list 38 identifiable peaks in the wider Twelve Bens range (i.e. core massif, Garraun complex, and various outliers to the west), with an elevation, or height, above 

The list below highlights the 12 Bens most associated with being the &quot;Twelve Bens&quot; from Ó Flaithbheartaigh&#x27;s original record. Of the standalone &quot;Bens&quot; (e.g. not listed as a &quot;Top&quot; of a parent Ben) that are over in height but are not listed in this 12, Binn an tSaighdiúra has a prominence of only 8 metres and would not qualify as an independent mountain on any recognised scale (the lowest prominence is 15 metres for the Vandeleur-Lynam classification); Maumonght does have a prominence exceeding 50 metres, and even has a subsidiary peak (Maumonght SW Top), however, Maumonght rarely appears on historic maps of the range and is not considered a &quot;Ben&quot;; Bencorrbeag also has a non-trivial prominence of 42 metres, however, it is considered unlikely given its positioning that it could have been distinguished by mariners from the sea (Ó Flaithbheartaigh&#x27;s original premise).

<text>Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) was a Junior Certificate subject offered in Ireland from 1997 to 2019. CSPE was a mandatory, non-academic subject that was mainly focused on project work. CSPE was offered only at Common Level, unlike most other subjects, which are offered at both Higher and Ordinary Level.

==Further details==
*CSPE is a &quot;common level&quot; subject unlike other subjects in the curriculum. The course encourages civic responsibility through the development of skills of active participation and through the undertaking of Action Projects and teaches about the basis of the Irish political system.
*There are seven key concepts in CSPE these include the promotion of Rights and Responsibilities, Human Dignity, Stewardship, Development, Democracy, Law and Interdependence

==Examination==
A total of 40% of the marks in the exam were awarded for a written theory test, which included such things as producing a poster, letter or article on a CSPE topic (such as poverty, racism, discrimination, etc.) and interpreting opinion polls. The written exam also had a number of short questions.

The remaining 60% of the marks were given for a report on an &quot;Action Project&quot; performed by an entire class of students at a time. This has to be based on one of the core topics - e.g. workers rights, environmentalism, racism, human rights, etc.

As from 2019, CSPE is not a subject in the Junior Certificate exam, but is still taught in schools.

==Senior Cycle==

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) have worked on a subject which focuses on citizenship as part of the Leaving Certificate curriculum. Politics and Society is based on key sociological concepts. This subject aims to develop the learner&#x27;s capacity to engage in reflective and active citizenship, informed by the insights and skills of social and political sciences.

Politics and Society was introduced as a new Leaving Certificate subject in September 2016 and was examined for certification for the first time in June 2018.

==Global==

===France===
In France, the equivalent of CSPE is called ECJS (&quot;éducation civique, juridique et sociale&quot;).

<doc id="1071155" wikidata="Q1940268" url="?curid=1071155" title="Mediterranean Fleet">
<text>The British Mediterranean Fleet, also known as the Mediterranean Station, was a formation of the Royal Navy. The Fleet was one of the most prestigious commands in the navy for the majority of its history, defending the vital sea link between the United Kingdom and the majority of the British Empire in the Eastern Hemisphere. The first Commander-in-Chief for the Mediterranean Fleet was the appointment of General at Sea Robert Blake in September 1654 (styled as Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet). The Fleet was in existence until 1967.

==Pre-Second World War==
The Royal Navy gained a foothold in the Mediterranean Sea when Gibraltar was captured by the British in 1704 during the War of Spanish Succession, and formally allocated to Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Though the British had maintained a naval presence in the Mediterranean before, the capture of Gibraltar allowed the British to establish their first naval base there. The British also used Port Mahon, on the island of Menorca, as a naval base. However, British control there was only temporary; Menorca changed hands numerous times, and was permanently ceded to Spain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens. In 1800, the British took Malta, which was to be handed over to the Knights of Malta under the Treaty of Amiens. When the Napoleonic Wars resumed in 1803, the British kept Malta for use as a naval base. Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the British continued their presence in Malta, and turned it into the main base for the Mediterranean Fleet. Between the 1860s and 1900s, the British undertook a number of projects to improve the harbours and dockyard facilities, and Malta&#x27;s harbours were sufficient to allow the entire fleet to be safely moored there.

In the last decade of the nineteenth century, the Mediterranean Fleet was the largest single squadron of the Royal Navy, with ten first-class battleships—double the number in the Channel Fleet—and a large number of smaller warships.

On 22 June 1893, the bulk of the fleet, eight battleships and three large cruisers, were conducting their annual summer exercises off Tripoli, Lebanon, when the fleet&#x27;s flagship, the battleship , collided with the battleship . &quot;Victoria&quot; sank within fifteen minutes, taking 358 crew with her. Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, was among the dead.

Of the three original s which entered service in the first half of 1908, two ( and ) joined the Mediterranean Fleet in 1914. They and formed the nucleus of the fleet at the start of the First World War when British forces pursued the German ships &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;.

A recently modernised became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief and Second-in-Command, Mediterranean Fleet in 1926.

==Second World War==

Malta, as part of the British Empire from 1814, was a shipping station and was the headquarters for the Mediterranean Fleet until the mid-1930s. Due to the perceived threat of air-attack from the Italian mainland, the fleet was moved to Alexandria, Egypt, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.

Sir Andrew Cunningham took command of the fleet from on 3 September 1939, and under him the major formations of the Fleet were the 1st Battle Squadron (, , and ) 1st Cruiser Squadron (, , and ), 3rd Cruiser Squadron (, , ), Rear Admiral John Tovey, with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Destroyer Flotillas, and the aircraft carrier .

In 1940, the Mediterranean Fleet carried out a successful aircraft carrier attack on the Italian Fleet at Taranto by air. Other major actions included the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Battle of Crete. The Fleet had to block Italian and later German reinforcements and supplies for the North African Campaign.

==Post war==

In October 1946, hit a mine in the Corfu Channel, starting a series of events known as the Corfu Channel Incident. The channel was cleared in &quot;Operation Recoil&quot; the next month, involving 11 minesweepers under the guidance of , two cruisers, three destroyers, and three frigates.

In May 1948, Sir Arthur Power took over as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean, and in his first act arranged a show of force to discourage the crossing of Jewish refugees into Palestine. When later that year Britain pulled out of the British Mandate of Palestine, &quot;Ocean&quot;, four destroyers, and two frigates escorted the departing High Commissioner, aboard the cruiser . The force stayed to cover the evacuation of British troops into the Haifa enclave and south via Gaza.

From 1952 to 1967, the post of Commander in Chief Mediterranean Fleet was given a dual-hatted role as NATO Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Mediterranean in charge of all forces assigned to NATO in the Mediterranean Area. The British made strong representations within NATO in discussions regarding the development of the Mediterranean NATO command structure, wishing to retain their direction of NATO naval command in the Mediterranean to protect their sea lines of communication running through the Mediterranean to the Middle East and Far East. When a NATO naval commander, Admiral Robert B. Carney, C-in-C Allied Forces Southern Europe, was appointed, relations with the incumbent British C-in-C, Admiral Sir John Edelsten, were frosty. Edlesten, on making an apparently friendly offer of the use of communications facilities to Carney, who initially lacked secure communications facilities, was met with &quot;I&#x27;m not about to play Faust to your Mephistopheles through the medium of communications!&quot;

In 1956, ships of the fleet, together with the French Navy, took part in the Suez War against Egypt.

From 1957 to 1959, Rear Admiral Charles Madden held the post of Flag Officer, Malta, with responsibilities for three squadrons of minesweepers, an amphibious warfare squadron, and a flotilla of submarines stationed at the bases around Valletta Harbour. In this capacity, he had to employ considerable diplomatic skill to maintain good relations with Dom Mintoff, the nationalistic prime minister of Malta.

In the 1960s, as the importance of maintaining the link between the United Kingdom and British territories and commitments East of Suez decreased as the Empire was dismantled, and the focus of Cold War naval responsibilities moved to the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Fleet was gradually drawn down, finally disbanding in June 1967. Eric Grove, in &quot;Vanguard to Trident&quot;, details how by the mid-1960s the permanent strength of the Fleet was &quot;reduced to a single small escort squadron [appears to have been 30th Escort Squadron with , , plus another ship] and a coastal minesweeper squadron.&quot; Deployments to the Beira Patrol and elsewhere reduced the escort total in 1966 from four to two ships, and then to no frigates at all. The Fleet&#x27;s assets and area of responsibility were absorbed into the new Western Fleet. As a result of this change, the UK relinquished the NATO post of Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Mediterranean, which was abolished.

==Principal officers ==
===Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Sea===
Note: This list is incomplete. The majority of officers listed were appointed as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Sea sometimes Commander-in-Chief, at the Mediterranean Sea earlier officers appointed to command either fleets/squadrons stationed in the Mediterranean for particular operations were styled differently see notes next to their listing

===Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet===

The first Commander-in-Chief for the Mediterranean Fleet may have been named as early as 1665. Commanders-in-chief have included:

====Chief of Staff====
The Chief of Staff was the principal staff officer (PSO), who is the coordinator of the supporting staff or a primary aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief.
====Fleet Headquarters====
The Mediterranean Fleets shore headquarters was initially based at Port Mahon Dockyard, Minorca for most of the eighteenth century. It rotated between Gibraltar and Malta from 1791 to 1812. From 1813 to July 1939 it was permanently at Malta Dockyard. In August 1939 the C-in-C Mediterranean Fleet moved his HQ afloat on board until April 1940. He was then back onshore at Malta until February 1941. He transferred it again to HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; until July 1942. In August 1942 headquarters were moved to Alexandria where they remained from June 1940 to February 1943. HQ was changed again but this time in rotation between Algiers and Taranto until June 1944. It then moved back to Malta until it was abolished in 1967.

=====Senior Flag Officers with fleet responsibilities=====

==Subordinate formations==
&quot;Note: At various times included the following&quot;.

Parts of the Admiral of Patrols&#x27; Auxiliary Patrol during World War One were within the Mediterranean. Several patrol zones were under British authority.

<text>The Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University is a private music and dance conservatory and preparatory school in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1857, it become affiliated with Johns Hopkins in 1977.

==History==
Philanthropist and merchant George Peabody (1795–1869) founded the institute in 1857 and opened it in 1866 with a bequest of about $800,000. This sum, from his personal fortune, was amassed initially in Massachusetts and later augmented in Baltimore (where he lived and worked from 1815 to 1835). It vastly increased through banking and finance during following residences in New York City and London, where he became the wealthiest American of his time.

Completion of the white marble Grecian-Italianate west wing, the original building housing the institute, designed by Edmund George Lind, was delayed by the Civil War. It was dedicated in 1866, with Peabody, having traveled across the North Atlantic Ocean, speaking at the ceremonies on the front steps in front of the Washington Monument circle before a large audience of notaries and citizens including hundreds of assembled pupils from the Baltimore City Public Schools. Under the direction of well-known musicians, composers, conductors, and Peabody alumni, the conservatory, concerts, lecture series, library and art gallery, along with the &quot;Peabody Prizes&quot; (an annual awarding of gold, silver and bronze medals with certificates and cash to top graduates of the city), attracted a considerable national attention to the Institute and the city&#x27;s growing culture. Under strong academic leadership, the Peabody evolved into an internationally renowned cultural and literary center through the late 19th and the 20th centuries, especially after a major expansion in 1877–1878, with the completion of its eastern half housing the George Peabody Library with five stacked tiers of wrought iron balconies holding book stacks(shelves), surmounted by a beveled glass skylight, one of the most beautiful and distinctive libraries in the U.S.

The 1878 east wing on East Mount Vernon Place, containing the affiliated George Peabody Library, joined the other rows of townhouses, mansions, art gallery, clubs, hotels, and churches around the Washington Monument which developed into the Mount Vernon neighborhood on the former estate of Revolutionary War commander John Eager Howard. The institute grew from a local academy, with an art and sculpture gallery, public lecture series, and the extensive reference library which, although non-circulating, predated the first public library system in America. The library was created and endowed in 1882 by Peabody&#x27;s friend Enoch Pratt. In turn, both Peabody and Pratt inspired the expansive philanthropic efforts of Scottish-American steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie.

In 1955, Peabody inaugurated a sacred music department led by Arthur Howes, which is now defunct.Its electronic music department, founded by composer Jean Eichelberger Ivey in 1967, was the first in any American conservatory, and remains the home of two historic Moog modular synthesizers from its first decade in operation.

In 1978, Peabody began working with Baltimore&#x27;s Johns Hopkins University under an affiliation agreement.In 1985, the institute officially became a constituent school of Johns Hopkins.

Peabody is one of 156 schools in the United States that offers a Doctorate of Musical Arts degree. It houses two libraries: the historical George Peabody Library (originally the Peabody Institute Library) established when the Institute opened in 1866, renowned for its collection of 19th-century and other rare books; and an additional music reference academic library, the Arthur Friedheim Library (named for the Russian-born pianist/ conductor), that includes more than 100,000 books, scores, and recordings.

The conservatory was later supplemented by a preparatory school and auditorium. &quot;Peabody Prizes&quot; are awarded to top high school graduates beginning the following year at commencement exercises and continued for 122 years as an annual tradition with public announcements to city media.

Additional structures along East Centre Street and Saint Paul Street, including a parking garage and two dormitory towers, were constructed in 1971. During the early 1990s, several remaining townhouses on East Mount Vernon Place to the east intersection with St. Paul were acquired and rebuilt, along with other townhouses with distinctive iron scrollwork balconies facing North Charles Street to the south. This enabled The Peabody to round out its tight campus of attached buildings to the entire city block bounded by Charles (Washington Place), Monument (Mount Vernon Place), St. Paul, and Centre Streets.

The Peabody campus is included in the Mount Vernon Place Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1971. The main building on Mount Vernon Place, built during 1857-1878, was designated a Baltimore City Landmark on October 14, 1975.

<doc id="1071168" wikidata="Q1822165" url="?curid=1071168" title="Lewis Theobald">
<text>Lewis Theobald (baptised 2 April 1688 – 18 September 1744), English textual editor and author, was a landmark figure both in the history of Shakespearean editing and in literary satire. He was vital for the establishment of fair texts for Shakespeare, and he was the first avatar of Dulness in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot;.

==Life and work==
Lewis Theobald was the son of Peter Theobald, an attorney, and his second wife, Mary. He was born in Sittingbourne, Kent, and baptized there on 2 April 1688.

When Peter Theobald died in 1690, Lewis was taken into the Rockingham household and educated with the sons of the family, which gave him the grounding in Greek and Latin that would serve his scholarship throughout his career. As a young man, he was apprenticed to an attorney and then set up his own law practice in London. In 1707, possibly while he was apprenticing, he published &quot;A Pindaric Ode on the Union of Scotland and England&quot; and &quot;Naufragium Britannicum.&quot;. In 1708 his tragedy &quot;The Persian Princess&quot; was performed at Drury Lane.

Theobald translated Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; in 1714 and was contracted by Bernard Lintot to translate the seven tragedies of Aeschylus but didn&#x27;t deliver. He translated Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Ajax&quot;, and &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; in 1715. Theobald also wrote for the Tory &quot;Mist&#x27;s Journal.&quot; He attempted to make a living with drama and began to work with John Rich at Drury Lane, writing pantomimes for him including &quot;Harlequin Sorcerer&quot; (1725), &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot; (1726), &quot;The Rape of Proserpine&quot; (1727), and &quot;Perseus and Andromeda&quot; (1730); many of these had music by Johann Ernst Galliard. He also probably plagiarized a man named Henry Meystayer. Meystayer had given Theobald a draft of a play called &quot;The Perfidious Brother&quot; to review, and Theobald had it produced as his own work.

Theobald&#x27;s fame and contribution to English letters rests with his 1726 &quot;Shakespeare Restored, or a Specimen of the many Errors as well Committed as Unamended by Mr Pope in his late edition of this poet; designed not only to correct the said Edition, but to restore the true Reading of Shakespeare in all the Editions ever published.&quot; Theobald&#x27;s variorum is, as its subtitle says, a reaction to Alexander Pope&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare. Pope had &quot;smoothed&quot; Shakespeare&#x27;s lines, and, most particularly, Pope had, indeed, missed many textual errors. In fact, when Pope produced a second edition of his Shakespeare in 1728, he incorporated many of Theobald&#x27;s textual readings. Pope claimed that he took in only &quot;about twenty-five words&quot; of Theobald&#x27;s corrections, but, in truth, he took in most of them. Additionally, Pope claimed that Theobald hid his information from Pope.

Pope was as much a better poet than Theobald as Theobald was a better editor than Pope, and the events surrounding Theobald&#x27;s attack and Pope&#x27;s counter-attack show both men at their heights. Theobald&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare Restored&quot; is a judicious, if ill-tempered, answer to Pope&#x27;s edition, but in 1733 Theobald produced a rival edition of Shakespeare in seven volumes for Jacob Tonson, the book seller. For the edition, Theobald worked with Bishop Warburton, who later (1747) also published an edition of Shakespeare. 
Theobald&#x27;s 1733 edition was far the best produced before 1750, and it has been the cornerstone of all subsequent editions. Theobald not only corrected variants but chose among best texts and undid many of the changes to the text that had been made by earlier 18th century editors. Edmond Malone&#x27;s later edition (the standard from which modern editors act) was built on Theobald&#x27;s.

==Theobald the Dunce==
Theobald (pronounced by Pope as &quot;Tibbald,&quot; though living members of his branch of the Theobald family say it was pronounced as spelled then, as it is today) was rewarded for his public rebuke of Pope by becoming the first hero of Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot; in 1728. In the &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot;, Pope goes much farther. In the apparatus to the poem, he collects ill comments made on Theobald by others, gives evidence that Theobald wrote letters to &quot;Mist&#x27;s Journal&quot; praising himself, and argues that Theobald had meant his &quot;Shakespeare Restored&quot; as an ambush. One of the damning bits of evidence came from John Dennis, who wrote of Theobald&#x27;s Ovid: &quot;There is a notorious Ideot . . . who from an under-spur-leather to the Law, is become an under-strapper to the Play-house, who has lately burlesqu&#x27;d the Metamorphoses of &quot;Ovid&quot; by a vile Translation&quot; (&quot;Remarks on Pope&#x27;s Homer&quot; p. 90). Until the second version of &quot;The Dunciad&quot; in 1741, Theobald remained the chief of the &quot;Dunces&quot; who led the way toward night (see the &quot;translatio stultitiae&quot;) by debasing public taste and bringing &quot;Smithfield muses to the ears of kings.&quot; Pope attacks Theobald&#x27;s plagiarism and work in vulgar drama directly, but the reason for the fury was in all likelihood the &quot;Shakespeare Restored.&quot; Even though Theobald&#x27;s work is invaluable, Pope succeeded in so utterly obliterating the character of the man that he is known by those who do not work with Shakespeare only as a dunce, as a dusty, pedantic, and dull witted scribe. In this, &quot;The Dunciad&quot; affected Theobald&#x27;s reputation for posterity much as Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot; affected Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s.

==&quot;Double Falshood&quot;==
In 1727, Theobald produced a play &quot;Double Falshood; or The Distrest Lovers&quot;, which he claimed to have based on a lost play by Shakespeare. Pope attacked it as a fraud, but admitted in private that he believed Theobald to have worked from, at the least, a genuine period work. Modern scholarship continues to be divided on the question of whether Theobald was truthful in his claim. &quot;Double Falshood&quot; may be based on the lost &quot;Cardenio&quot;, by Shakespeare and John Fletcher, which Theobald may have had access to in a surviving manuscript, which he revised for the tastes of the early eighteenth century. However, Theobald&#x27;s claims about the origins of the play are not consistent and have not been uniformly accepted by critics.

<text>Affpuddle is a small village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Affpuddle and Turnerspuddle, in the Dorset district of the ceremonial county of Dorset, England, east of Dorchester. The local travel links are from the village to Moreton railway station and to Bournemouth International Airport. Part of the village street is the B3390, which divides the village into two. Affpuddle parish included the settlements of Briantspuddle to the east and Pallington to the south. In the 2001 census this parish had a population of 402. On 1 April 2010 the parish was abolished and merged with Turners Puddle to form &quot;Affpuddle &amp; Turnerspuddle&quot;. In the 2011 census this joint parish had 200 households and a population of 436.

Affpuddle village is in the Piddle valley, just north of the Purbeck conifer plantations and heathland, in a valley beside the villages of Tolpuddle and Puddletown. The village is linear and made of brick, stone and thatched cottages and has a 13th-century church dedicated to St Laurence.

==History==
The village was established during or before the Saxon era, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Affapidela&quot;, having a manor house belonging to the Abbot of Cerne. After the Dissolution the village became an estate of the Lawrence family, an ancestor of whom married the heiress of a branch of the Washington family, from another branch of which descended George Washington. The Washington arms was quartered by the Lawrences and thus appears on the north wall of the chancel in the village church on a Lawrence monument. The church of St Laurence is noted for its elaborate pews, dated 1545 or 1547, and the finely carved pulpit, undated but in a very similar style. The church dates from the 13th century but was enlarged by an aisle and a tower in the 15th century. Other features of interest are the Norman font and south doorway.

The earliest records in Dorset of the agricultural practice of flooding fields to form watermeadows refer to Affpuddle in the early 17th century; Edward Lawrence, the lord of the manor at the time, was interested in agricultural improvement and favoured the use of flooding here and in neighbouring Briantspiddle and Pallington, where he also had manors.

The village later belonged to the Framptons of Moreton, noted for their involvement with the Tolpuddle Martyrs. John Lock who gave key evidence against them also lived in the village.

<text>Allington is a neighbourhood of Bridport in Dorset, England, immediately north-west of Bridport town centre on the west bank of the River Brit. Formerly a separate village and civil parish, Allington and Bridport had grown to be contiguous by the end of the 19th century.

Allington Hill rises to above the town; it is managed by the Woodland Trust. The hill is characteristic of the Upper Greensand hills and ridges found in the Marshwood and Powerstock Vales National Character Area.

In 1086 in the Domesday Book Allington was recorded as &quot;Adelingtone&quot;; it had 21 households, 3 ploughlands, of meadow and one mill. It was in Goderthorn Hundred and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Turstin son of Rolf.
The parish church at North Allington, dedicated to St Swithun, was designed by Charles Wallis of Dorchester and built in 1826–27, and is a Grade II* listed building. It is in classical style, and is unusual for the survival of a high proportion of the original internal fittings, including the pews, gallery, a pulpit (of two originally present) and glazing.

==Governance==
At the lower tier of local government, Allington is in Bridport civil parish. It is part of Bridport West and Allington electoral ward, which elects five of the 20 members of Bridport Town Council.

The upper tier of local government is the Dorset unitary authority. Allington is in Bridport electoral ward, which elects three of the 82 members of Dorset Council. Before the creation of the Dorset unitary authority, Allington was in West Dorset district from 1974 to 2019. Before this, Allington civil parish was in Bridport Rural District from 1894 to 1974, though much of the built-up part of Allington had already transferred to Bridport Municipal Borough.

For elections to the UK national parliament, Allington is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

===Allington parish===
Historically, Allington was a civil parish separate from Bridport. Over time, much of the built-up area of the Allington neighbourhood, including the area around St Swithun&#x27;s Church, transferred to Bridport Municipal Borough or later Bridport civil parish, leaving only a suburban fringe and rural hinterland in Allington parish. When the parish was abolished on 1 April 2024, rural parts of the parish area which weren&#x27;t taken into Bridport parish went to Symondsbury parish.

In the 2011 census, Allington civil parish had 371 dwellings, 339 households and a population of 766.

<text>PlayMaker Football is an American football simulation produced by PlayMaker Software. The first version of the game was released in 1989 by Broderbund for the Macintosh. It has since been ported to the Microsoft Windows and Palm OS. The most recent versions are 2.4 for the Macintosh and Palm OS platforms and 2.3 for the Microsoft Windows platform.

==Summary==
&quot;PlayMaker Football&quot; allows one to take the role of a coach of a team of 30 football players. The coach can create a team using the Team Draft mode of the program, and then design and test plays using the Chalkboard Editor mode. The Chalkboard Editor mode also allows the coach to create artificial intelligence settings for each play, used by the program to determine which play to call on each down of a game. The Game mode allows the coach to play games between two teams, each under the control of a coach or the computer.

&quot;PlayMaker Football&quot; spawned a small but dedicated community of players on online providers such as America Online and CompuServe. This community is still around today, with several internet sites available for coaches to join organized leagues.

&quot;PlayMaker Football 2.0&quot; was released in 1996 for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows.

==Reception==
&quot;PlayMaker Football 2.1.4&quot; was reviewed by mymac.com in 1997. The reviewers highlighted the realism, sound effects and the community of enthusiasts that were present online.

<text>Alton Pancras is a small village and civil parish in Dorset, England. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 175.

The village church is dedicated to Saint Pancras, which provides part of the village name. The parish was formerly a liberty, containing only the parish itself.

==History==

Evidence of prehistoric human activity within the parish includes two round barrows on the hills to the east of the village (one on West Hill and one on Church Hill), the remains of &#x27;Celtic&#x27; fields and strip lynchets on many of the surrounding hills, and a possible settlement just south of the summit of Church Hill. Dating is not definite but the &#x27;Celtic&#x27; fields were probably in use between the Bronze Age and the end of the Romano-British period. The possible settlement is probably Romano-British. Subsequent cultivation, particularly in modern times, has destroyed much of the evidence.

The village itself was likely first settled by Saxons during the expansion of the Kingdom of Wessex. The name of the village was then Awultune, meaning in West Saxon &#x27;village at the source of the river&#x27; (the River Piddle). The village was previously two separate settlements: Barcombe and Alton, both of which had their own open field system. In 1086 in the Domesday Book the village was recorded as &quot;Altone&quot;. It had 26 households, was in Cerne, Totcombe and Modbury Hundred, and the tenant-in-chief was the Bishop of Salisbury. Local tradition believes that after conversion to Christianity, the village name incorporated the little-known St Pancras and that by the time of the Battle of Agincourt (1415), was known as Aulton Pancras. However, in Christopher Saxton&#x27;s map of 1575 it is still known as &#x27;Ælton&#x27; and in John Speed&#x27;s map of 1610, it is listed as &#x27;Alton&#x27;. In a later 1760 map by Emanuel Bowen, the village is listed as &#x27;Alton Pancras&#x27;.

The current church was restored in the 19th century after an earlier Norman church was near collapse. All that remains of the old church is the 15th-century tower and a Norman arch. The church organ used to be a fairground organ. The floor tiles were created by Poole Pottery.

==Governance==

For elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Alton Pancras is in the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

In local government, Alton Pancras is in the Dorset unitary authority. For elections to Dorset Council it is in the Chalk Valleys electoral ward.

At the parish level – the lowest tier of local government – Alton Pancras is one of three parishes governed by Piddle Valley Group Parish Council. The other parishes are Piddlehinton and Piddletrenthide.
==Geography==

Alton Pancras civil parish covers at the head of the valley of the River Piddle. The valley is on the dip slope of the Dorset Downs and drains from north to south. Several small side combes extend east and west. In the east the parish includes part of a tributary valley at Watcombe Bottom, north of Plush, and in the northeast it extends north of the escarpment to Alton Common in the Blackmore Vale. The underlying geology of the parish is mostly chalk, except for the Alton Common extension, which is on greensand, gault and Kimmeridge clay. Alton Pancras village is sited in the valley near the source of the River Piddle at an altitude of about . The altitude of the parish is between about at its highest point on the hills to the west, to about at its lowest point where the river leaves the parish in the south. The broadcaster and agriculturist Ralph Wightman, who was born and lived in the nearby village of Piddletrenthide, described the hills surrounding the village as &quot;very much in the centre of Dorset&quot;. All of Alton Pancras parish is within the Dorset National Landscape area. Horse Close Wood on Alton Common is a Woodland Trust wood, though it is not open to the public.

Alton Pancras village is situated on the B3143 road, which connects it to the county town of Dorchester to the south. Other local travel links include Maiden Newton railway station to the south-west, and Bournemouth International Airport to the east.

==Demography==

In the 2011 census Alton Pancras civil parish had 72 dwellings, 71 households and a population of 175. The average age of parish residents was 42, compared to 39.3 for England as a whole. 16.0% of residents were age 65 or over, compared to 16.4% for England as a whole.

<text>Shall We Dance? is a 2004 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Peter Chelsom and starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, and Susan Sarandon. It is a remake of the 1996 Japanese film of the same name.

==Plot==
John Clark is a lawyer with a charming wife, Beverly, and a loving family, who nevertheless feels that something is missing as he makes his way every day through the city. Each evening on his commute home through Chicago, John sees a beautiful woman staring with a lost expression through the window of a dance studio. Haunted by her gaze, John impulsively jumps off the train one night, and signs up for ballroom dancing lessons, hoping to meet her.

At first, it seems like a mistake. His teacher turns out not to be the woman in the window, Paulina, but the studio&#x27;s older namesake, Miss Mitzi, and John proves to be just as clumsy as his equally clueless classmates Chic and Vern on the dance-floor. Even worse, when he does meet Paulina, she icily tells John she hopes he has come to the studio to seriously study dance and not to look for a date. But, as his lessons continue, John falls in love with dancing.

Keeping his new obsession from his family and co-workers, John feverishly trains for Chicago&#x27;s biggest dance competition. His friendship with Paulina blossoms, as his enthusiasm rekindles her own lost passion for dance. But the more time John spends away from home, the more his wife Beverly becomes suspicious. She hires a private investigator to find out what John is doing, but when she finds out the truth, she chooses to discontinue the investigation and not invade her husband&#x27;s privacy.

John is partnered with Bobbie for the competition, although his friend Link steps in to do the Latin dances. Link and Bobbie do well in the Latin dances, and while John and Bobbie&#x27;s waltz goes well, John hears his wife and daughter in the crowd during the quickstep, and is distracted by trying to find them. He and Bobbie fall and are disqualified, and John and Beverly argue in the parking garage. John quits dancing, to everyone&#x27;s dismay.

Paulina, having been inspired by John to take up competing again, is leaving to go to Europe, and is having a going-away party at the dance studio. She sends John an invitation, but he is not convinced to go until his wife leaves out a pair of dancing shoes that she bought him. He goes and meets Beverly at work, convinces her that while he loves dancing, he still loves her just as much, and he teaches her to dance. They go to the party, and John and Paulina have one last dance before she leaves.

The end scene shows everyone afterwards: Link and Bobbie are now together; Chic, who was actually gay, dances at a club with his partner; Miss Mitzi finds a new partner, and they are happy together; John and Beverly are happier than before and dance in the kitchen; Vern, newly married to his fiancée, dances with her at their wedding; the private investigator that Beverly hired, Devine, starts up dance lessons; and Paulina, with a new partner, competes at the Blackpool Dance Festival, the competition that she had lost the year before.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film debuted on October 15, 2004, grossing $11,783,467 in its opening weekend, placing fourth at the North American box office. Despite its 27% decline in gross earnings, it rose to the third spot the following week. The film ran for 133 days, grossing $57,890,460 in the United States and $112,238,000 internationally, for a worldwide total of $170,128,460.

===Reception===
&quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; received a 47% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 158 critics. The consensus states: &quot;The cast is warmly appealing, but with the loss of cultural context and addition of big-name celebrities, this American version loses the nuances of the original.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating &quot;I enjoyed the Japanese version so much I invited it to my Overlooked Film Festival a few years ago, but this remake offers pleasures of its own.&quot;

==Title==
The original Japanese film had a question mark in its title, and the publicity poster for this film also includes it. However, the actual film titles on the US film appear as simply &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;, leading to some online sources, including IMDb, referring to it without showing the question mark. The inclusion of the question mark serves to distinguish these two films from the 1937 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;.

<doc id="1071235" wikidata="Q1796768" url="?curid=1071235" title="Chrismukkah">
<text>Chrismukkah is a pop-culture portmanteau neologism referring to the merging of the holidays of Christianity&#x27;s Christmas and Judaism&#x27;s Hanukkah. It first arose in the German-speaking countries within middle-class Jews of the 19th century. After World War II, Chrismukkah became particularly popular in the United States, but is also celebrated in other countries.

The term was popularized beginning in December 2003 by the TV drama &quot;The O.C.&quot;, wherein character Seth Cohen creates the holiday to signify his upbringing in an interfaith household with a Jewish father and Protestant mother. The holiday can also be adopted by all-Jewish households who celebrate Christmas as a secular holiday.

==History==
The proximity of the beginning of the Hanukkah festival on the 25th of Kislev (end of November/December) to Christmas led to the so-called &quot;December Dilemma&quot; for Jewish families living in societies that were largely Christian. The history of an informal merger between Hanukkah and Christmas dates back to 19th century Germany and Austria. In German it is called Weihnukka, a combination of the words &quot;Weihnachten&quot; (Christmas) and &quot;Hanukkah&quot;.

In the 19th century, Christmas had established itself in the German-speaking countries as a festival in which, in addition to the spiritual significance, values such as family and charity were in the foreground. Christmas customs such as the Christmas tree, Christmas decorations, gifts or Christmas dinner were perceived more as a seasonal than a strictly Christian tradition. The proximity of the beginning of the Hanukkah festival to Christmas and the adoption of various traditions such as a decorated tree or gifts led to a mixture of traditions that were referred to as &quot;Weihnukka&quot; at the time. Modern Jewish families in particular adopted elements of the Christmas tradition in the Hanukkah festival. For example, Hanukkah gifts or money became common in the 19th century. Many families from the assimilated German-Jewish bourgeoisie celebrated Christmas directly as a purely secular winter festival. The first historically documented Christmas tree was erected in Vienna in 1814 by the Jewish socialite Fanny von Arnstein, who had brought this custom from Berlin. The founder of Zionism Theodor Herzl also celebrated Christmas or at least allowed a tree to be set up in his house for his children and suggested the name &quot;Hanukkah Tree&quot;. Common elements of this secular Christmas festival and its influence on the Hanukkah festival among Jews were a Hanukkah tree or Hanukkah bush as a counterpart to the Christmas tree, the Hanukkah Man, who, as a counterpart to Santa Claus, brought the presents for the children, or the Hanukkah calendar with eight flaps.

After the Shoah and the associated near-extinction of Jewish life in central Europe, cultural life increasingly shifted to the United States. Here it became common to celebrate both festivals due to interfaith marriages between Jews and Christians and the associated wish of both partners to maintain their respective festivals and customs. The so-called “December dilemma” arose in Jewish families, namely the desire to add something similar to the popular festival of Christmas with its traditions, celebrations and gifts. Gifts for the Hanukkah festival in particular were to enhance this festival and contrast Christmas with something of equal emotional value.

In the 1990s, the popular sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; often portrayed Jewish characters Rachel, Ross and Monica celebrating Christmas with their Christian friends, signifying many contemporary American Jewish households who celebrate Christmas in the strictly secular sense.

Chrismukkah was named for the first time, and prominently featured, in the FOX television program &quot;The O.C.&quot; (2003–2007). Show creator Josh Schwartz used the holiday (which the writers almost named &quot;Hanimas&quot;) to depict, he later said,

On &quot;The O.C.&quot;, as a way to merge his parents&#x27; two faiths, Seth Cohen claims to have &quot;created the greatest superholiday known to mankind&quot; when he was six years old. The series included annual Chrismukkah episodes for every season of its run. Particulars of when exactly the holiday was celebrated were not given; Seth simply said in the first season&#x27;s Chrismukkah episode that it was &quot;eight days of presents, followed by one day of &quot;many&quot; presents,&quot; with a stress on the word &quot;many&quot; (this was repeated in the second season&#x27;s Chrismukkah episode by Seth&#x27;s new brother Ryan, with an added &quot;many&quot;). The only references to how it was celebrated, other than the family displaying both a Christmas tree and a Hanukkah menorah, was that the Cohens spent Christmas Day itself at home eating Chinese takeout and watching movies like &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; on TV (as opposed to going out for Chinese food and seeing a movie, as many American Jews have done for years). Chrismukkah later received mention in the television series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

In 2004, Chrismukkah.com was launched by Ron and Michelle Gompertz, a Jewish-Christian intermarried couple in Bozeman, Montana. Their website took the fictional &quot;O.C.&quot; Chrismukkah and brought it into reality, selling humorous Chrismukkah greeting cards and dispensing detailed mythology about the fictional holiday. The Chrismukkah.com website was widely credited with popularizing Chrismukkah to a non-television watching audience. Chrismukkah.com stirred up controversy in the Fall of 2004 when the New York Catholic League issued a national press release opposing Chrismukkah. Further, The Catholic League and the New York Board of Rabbis, in a joint statement, condemned Chrismukkah as &quot;insulting&quot; to Jews and Christians.

In December 2004, Chrismukkah was listed in &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the buzzwords of the year. It was also reported in a Scottish newspaper, that Chrismukkah had been added to the authoritative &quot;Chambers&quot; dictionary. In 2005, Chrismukkah.com founder Ron Gompertz authored a humorous book of Chrismukkah recipes called &quot;Chrismukkah! The Merry Mish-Mash Holiday Cookbook.&quot; Gompertz&#x27;s follow-up book, entitled &quot;Chrismukkah – Everything You Need to Know to Celebrate the Hybrid Holiday&quot; (published by Stewart, Tabori and Chang) was released in October 2006. A rival book by Gersh Kuntzman, &quot;Chrismukkah: The Official Guide to the World&#x27;s Best-Loved Holiday&quot; (Sasquatch Press), came out at around the same time. In &quot;A Kosher Christmas: &#x27;Tis the Season to Be Jewish,&quot;(Rutgers University Press, 2013) author Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut, Ph.D discusses Chrismukkah and the creation of Festivus and other hybrid holidays among Jews in America during December. In 2006 &quot;USA Today&quot; described Chrismukkah as &quot;[t]he newest faux holiday that companies are using to make a buck this season&quot;. Chrismukkah is also celebrated as an ironic, alternative holiday, much like the &quot;Seinfeld&quot;-derived &quot;Festivus&quot;. 

The Jewish Museum Berlin held a special exhibition about &quot;Weihnukka&quot; in 2005.

==Exact coincidence of Hanukkah with Christmas==
In 2005, the sunset of December 25 coincided with 25 Kislev, the first night of Hanukkah, making Christmas Day and the beginning of Hanukkah the same day. This happened again 2024. In 2016, the sunset of December 24 coincided with 25 Kislev, the first day of Hanukkah, making Christmas Eve and the beginning of Hanukkah the same day. This will not happen again until 2027.

==Similar holidays==
A similarly named holiday called Christmanukkah was featured in &quot;The Strangerhood&quot;. Unlike Chrismukkah, Christmanukkah is twenty days long (twelve days of Christmas and another eight for Hanukkah), and all of the days are spent receiving gifts and eating until passing out. Pants and pumpkin cider are considered a traditional gift.

Hannumass was created by Boyz II Men singer Wanya Morris and his wife. Referenced in ABC&#x27;s &quot;A Very Boy Band Holiday&quot;.

Similar neologisms such as &quot;Chrismahanukwanzakah&quot; and &quot;HanuKwanzMas&quot; blend Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.

<doc id="1071240" wikidata="Q3119443" url="?curid=1071240" title="Batcombe, Dorset">
<text>Batcombe is a small straggling village and civil parish in Dorset, England, situated north-west of Dorchester below the northern scarp slope of the Dorset Downs. The name Batcombe derives from the Old English &quot;Bata&quot;, a man&#x27;s name, and &quot;cumb&quot;, meaning valley. In 1201 it was known as &quot;Batecumbe&quot;. The local travel links are located from the village to Chetnole railway station and to Bournemouth International Airport. The main road running through the village is Stile Way. Dorset County Council&#x27;s 2013 mid-year estimate of the population of the civil parish was 120. The civil parish is served by High Stoy Parish Council, which also covers Hermitage and Hilfield parishes.

== Parish church ==
The church of St Mary Magdalene is on an ancient site. There has probably been a church there from the 11th century. The current building comprises a chancel, nave and 15th-century tower. The interior contains a font that has a Norman column (made from Ham Hill stone) with a cube-shaped limestone basin (probably made from Portesham stone); the basin is probably older than the column. The church interior also contains an elaborate stone screen, which is also made from Ham Hill stone.

== Cross-in-Hand ==
Above the village rises Batcombe Down and, further east, Gore Hill, near the top of which is a small stone pillar known as the Cross-in-Hand (or Cross and Hand). The pillar, a Grade II listed structure and a Scheduled Ancient Monument, is a little over in height and may date from before the Norman Conquest, as do other shafts such as the Pillar of Eliseg. At one time there may have been a hand carved on one face, but nothing is visible today, though the pillar has acquired stories about images of a ghostly hand being seen grasping a bowl at its top. Thomas Hardy used the pillar in his novel &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, in a scene in which Alec d&#x27;Urberville instructs Tess to &quot;put your hand upon that stone hand, and swear that you will never tempt me—by your charms or ways.&quot; The pillar also features in Hardy&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lost Pyx&quot;.

== Manor house ==
The Minterne family was for a long time the Lords of the Manor and Newlands Farm was the manor house between the 16th and 18th centuries. The front roadside wall of the farmhouse has an ashlar hamstone archway dating from 1622.

== Folklore ==
The parish church is the subject of one of Dorset&#x27;s more curious tales, in which the local squire—who was known as &#x27;Conjuring Minterne&#x27;—once rode his horse off Batcombe Hill and knocked off one of the pinnacles on the tower. He dabbled in magic and was regarded with a great deal of fear and superstition locally. After setting off to ride over steep Batcombe Hill one day, he suddenly remembered he had left his magic book open on the table, where his servants might find it. To save going back by the road, he turned his horse round and spurred it to attempt a massive leap over the church, knocking off the pinnacle as he soared clear over the tower. The fearful villagers were afraid that they might offend the devil by repairing the damage, so for a hundred years they left it alone. When it was repaired, they repaired it at a crooked angle. It is said that Minterne vowed that he would be buried neither in nor out of the church, so he was buried half in and half out of the Minterne Chapel. Much of the church was rebuilt by John Hicks in 1864, which resulted in the loss of the Minterne chapel. The memorial tablets were repositioned on the north side of the tower.

A &quot;conjurer&quot; used to be an important character in a Dorset village, and was generally of good reputation. He was supposed to be gifted with supernatural power, which he exercised for good, and by his incantations and ceremonies he cured many sicknesses.

<text>Olímpia is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, in the Microregion of São José do Rio Preto. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 55,130 inhabitants. The city has a total area of .

==History==

The oldest archaeological evidence in the territory dates back to the centuries 9th or 10th. In the early 1990s, workers of construction found four funerary urns containing bones, bead necklaces, and pots inside, which was later linked to the Tupi, and Macro Je people. Although it is known that Latin America was inhabited by nomadic tribes, this is actually the oldest evidence of human presence in the area prior to European colonization.

In the 19th century, the foundation of Olimpia (formerly knows as Fazenda Olhos d&#x27;Água, and then, Vila Olímpia) is related to the coffee industry during the Empire of Brazil, when plantation owners meet the demand of labor.

With the exhaustion of the gold mines, people abandoned their previous sites in search of a better one. The new settlers focus on the unexplored areas to dedicate themselves to agriculture and cattle raising.

The first reports indicate that a farmer named &quot;Antônio Joaquim dos Santos&quot; was the first settler to establish a farm in the 19th century. He named his property as &quot;Fazenda Olhos D&#x27;Água&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Water holes farm&quot;) due to the amount of water springs in the area.

The increasing numbers of migrant colonials settling in the area and the need for a collectivized farming led the local community the decision to create the village. In 1903, the landowners invitated the English immigrants Robert John Reid, and William Leatherbarrow, to separate the lands and establish the city.

The town was elevated to a district of Barretos on December 18, 1906, and named as &quot;Vila Olímpia&quot; in honor to Maria Olímpia Rodrigues Vieira, who was the daughter of Antônio Olímpio Rodrigues Vieira. Vieira was one of the founders of the city.

Nowadays, a range of buildings reveal the timeline of Olimpia&#x27;s history and were declared historical landmarks, such as the old railway station, and the first hospital of the city &quot;Beneficiência Portuguesa&quot;.

The city was separated from Barretos on December 7, 1917.

In July 2014, it was approved by the São Paulo State Legislative Assembly, a bill that turned Olímpia into a Touristic Municipality.

<text>Monterey Regional Airport is three miles (5 km) southeast of Monterey, in Monterey County, California, United States. It was created in 1936 and was known as the Monterey Peninsula Airport until the board of directors renamed it on September 14, 2011.

The airport is owned by the municipalities that make up the Monterey Peninsula Airport District. It is a public entity and its five-member board of directors is publicly elected.

The airport has its origins with flights from the polo field of the Hotel Del Monte in 1910. In 1941, local communities formed the Monterey Peninsula Airport District and acquired land to build an airport. World War II intervened, and the U.S. Navy leased the land, opening Naval Auxiliary Air Station Monterey on May 23, 1943. The Navy remained at the airport until 1972.

==Runways==
The airport covers and has two runways:
* 10R/28L: asphalt
* 10L/28R: asphalt

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===


As of September 2024, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines are the only airlines serving Monterey with mainline jets. Allegiant planned to fly Boeing 757-200s nonstop to Honolulu starting in November 2012; however, this Hawaii service never started and was subsequently permanently cancelled. Avelo Airlines also planned Boeing 737-800 service to Burbank beginning in September 2021; however, this service was also cancelled temporarily before it launched.

===Historical airline service===

In 1933, Pacific Seaboard Air Lines scheduled passenger flights on single engine Bellanca CH-300s, two daily round trips involving Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles, Monterey, Salinas, San Jose, and San Francisco. Pacific Seaboard later moved its operation to the eastern U.S., was renamed Chicago and Southern Air Lines, and become a domestic and international airline that in 1953 was acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines.

According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in late 1978. four airlines were operating daily nonstop jet service on the short hop from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) including Air California with Boeing 737-200s, Hughes Airwest with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) with Boeing 727-200s, and United Airlines with Boeing 737-200s. This same OAG also lists nonstop 737 jet service operated by United and nonstop 727 jet service operated by Pacific Southwest from the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), nonstop 737 service operated by Air California from Ontario, CA (ONT), Orange County, CA (SNA). and Sacramento (SMF) as well as direct, no change of plane 737 jet service operated by United from Denver (DEN), Reno (RNO). and Salt Lake City (SLC) and also direct one-stop 737 service by Air California and direct one-stop 727 service by Pacific Southwest from San Diego (SAN). 

Before starting 727 service, Pacific Air Lines served Monterey with Martin 4-0-4s followed by Fairchild F-27s. Predecessor Southwest Airways began serving Monterey in the late 1940s with Douglas DC-3s. Pacific Air Lines merged with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines in 1968 to form Air West, which was renamed Hughes Airwest in 1970 after its acquisition by Howard Hughes.

==Accidents and incidents==
On June 14, 1964 at about 7:35 pm a Piper PA-28 (tail number N5384W) hit trees in Monterey, killing the 34-year-old student pilot. The investigation into the fatal accident revealed that the pilot misjudged his altitude, flying too low and under the influence of alcohol. The crash also caused the Piper to catch fire.

On August 17, 1968 at about 12:36 pm, a Cessna 210 (tail number N9676T) stalled while landing at the Monterey Peninsula Airport. During the landing, the 48-year-old pilot suffered a heart attack, which caused his Cessna to stall. The Cessna was destroyed upon impact. The pilot had about 5,743 flight hours of experience.

On July 26, 1979 at about 9:43 pm a Cessna 320A (tail number N3005R) crashed during its final approach to Monterey. The 62-year-old pilot used improper Instrument Flight Rules operations. The pilot had about 3,621 flight hours.

On August 23, 1984 at about 8:51 pm a Cessna 320C (tail number N7AE) departed from Monterey under Special Visual Flight Rules with a 58-year-old pilot and four passengers. At about 8:55 pm Air Traffic Control advised N7AE to turn left to avoid rising terrain. The Cessna was unable to avoid the terrain, crashed, and caught fire; all aboard died. The investigation revealed that the pilot made poor decisions and did not follow instructions from Air Traffic Control. The pilot had about 2,041 hours of flight experience.

On July 27, 1985 a Piper PA-28-235 (tail number N15548) took off from Monterey to practice holding patterns over Monterey Bay. About 12 minutes into the flight, the 60-year-old pilot radioed Air Traffic Control, &quot;Mayday, rough engine.&quot; The Piper disappeared from Air Traffic Control&#x27;s radar at about 1300 feet. Later the United States Coast Guard discovered pieces of the Piper in the ocean. The investigation revealed that the pilot used improper procedures. The pilot had about 1,923 hours of flight experience.

On July 24, 1987 a Piper PA-32R-301T (tail number N82793) was cleared for an Instrument Landing System approach when the 39-year-old pilot decided to conduct a go around procedure. About 30 seconds after initiating the procedure, the pilot radioed Air Traffic Control, &quot;Seven niner three, in trouble.&quot; Sixteen seconds later another transmission is broadcast, &quot;I have, I have an emergency back here.&quot; The Piper was seen making a 400-foot descent below assigned altitude and disappeared into Monterey Bay. A boater reported seeing the Piper &quot;dive out&quot; of a cloud and crash into the water. The investigation revealed that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation and lacked instrument flying time. The pilot had about 528 hours of flight experience.

On September 8, 1987 at about 5:50 pm, a Beechcraft 95 (tail number N845B), being flown by a 31-year-old student pilot, was conducting multi-engine training at Monterey. The pilot started practicing Instrument Landing System approaches. During an approach for a landing, the Beechcraft crashed into the ground. The investigation revealed that there was inadequate supervision during the training exercise. The pilot and student pilot were killed.

On June 24, 1992 a Cessna 421B (tail number N628RJ), the 40-year-old pilot and two passengers took off from Monterey. About three minutes after takeoff the Cessna collided with a hill about three miles east of the airport. The investigation revealed that ground fog and overconfidence in the pilot caused the accident. All three were killed. The pilot had about 75 hours of flight experience.

On August 7, 1997 at about 8:00 pm a Grumman American AA-5 (tail number N6086L) took off from Monterey. The Grumman was later found 18 miles south of the airport. It had crashed into the mountains which caused the Grumman to catch fire. The 31-year-old pilot had about 4,000 hours of flight experience.

On October 12, 1997 at about 5:28 pm a Rutan Long-EZ (tail number N555JD) being flown by musician and performer John Denver crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove. After taking off from Monterey the Long-EZ started its climb then descended into the bay. The investigation revealed that the collision was caused by the fuel valve selector being in an improper position. Inadequate flight planning also contributed to the collision. John Denver had about 2,750 hours of flight experience and was fatally injured in this accident.

On July 13, 2021, at around 10:42 am, a Cessna 421C (tail number N678SW), piloted by Mary Ellen Carlin crashed into a suburban residential area killing the pilot, passenger and a pet. Investigators found that the Cessna 421C diverged from its flight plan, resulting in a crash less than five minutes after departure.

<text>Po‘e or poke is a Polynesian pudding usually eaten as a dessert.

==Etymology==
The Tahitian word &quot;po&#x27;e&quot; is derived from the proto-Polynesian root &quot;poke&quot; which means &quot;to mix&quot;, &quot;to knead&quot;. It is still called &quot;poke&quot; in all Polynesian languages except in the Tahitian language and in the Austral language on the island of Raivavae where the glottal stop (written as an apostrophe &#x27;) has replaced the voiceless velar stop (k).

==Preparation==
Traditionally po&#x27;e was made by cooking and mashing bananas into a smooth consistency and mixing together with arrowroot flour. The mixture was wrapped in banana leaves and baked in an earth oven until set into a pudding-like consistency, cut into smaller pieces and served together with coconut cream. Modern versions of the recipe replace bananas with other fruits such as papaya, mango or squash and using cassava or corn starch as the thickening agent.

<text>Quartermaster is a military term, the meaning of which depends on the country and service. In land armies, a quartermaster is an officer who supervises logistics and requisitions, manages stores or barracks, and distributes supplies and . In many navies, a quartermaster is a seaman or petty officer with responsibility for navigation and operation of the helm of a ship.

The term appears to derive from the title of a German royal official, the . This term meant &quot;master of quarters&quot; (where &quot;quarters&quot; refers to lodging or accommodation). Alternatively, it could have been derived from &quot;master of the quarterdeck&quot; where the helmsman and captain controlled the ship. The term&#x27;s first use in English was as a naval term, which entered English in the 15th century via the equivalent French and Dutch naval titles and , respectively. The term began to refer to army officers in English around 1600.

==Army use==

For land armies, the term was first coined in Germany as &quot;Quartiermeister&quot; and initially denoted a court official with the duty of preparing the monarch&#x27;s sleeping quarters. In the 17th century, it started to be used in various militaries in the sense of organizing supplies.

From at least the English Civil War period until 1813, the quartermaster was the senior NCO in a British cavalry troop, in which context he had nothing to do with supply. In that year, the position was replaced by the new appointment of troop sergeant major, with the cavalry adopting commissioned, regimental quartermasters as described above.

===Canada===
From Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps standing orders:

In recent years, the quartermaster has been a specially trained officer of the Royal Canadian Logistics Service, though CFR (commissioned from ranks) officers have been known to accept regimental appointments such as quartermaster.

===Israel===

In the IDF, the battalion quartermaster is also the commander of the battalions support company, known as the battalion headquarters company. In the standing army he is usually a captain, but the role is a major&#x27;s role. In the reserve army he is usually a major. While most of the staff officers are directly under the command of the battalion commander, the quartermaster has a lieutenant, a logistics officer and a junior ordnance officer (the battalion&#x27;s ordnance platoon commander) under his direct command. He is in charge of all logistics issues in the battalion and also in charge of the battalion&#x27;s headquarter&#x27;s day-to-day life.
He is commissioned as an officer by the &quot;ramatkal&quot; (the army&#x27;s general chief of staff), and as a logistic officer by &quot;kalar&quot; (the army&#x27;s general logistic officer).
In large camps and higher headquarters (brigade, division and corps HQ), apart from the staff officer in charge of logistics, there is also a role defined mostly as &quot;camp commander&quot;, who is in charge of the HQ logistic issues, ceremonies and parades and discipline. These duties differ slightly in the air force and navy. The ranks of IDF quartermasters vary from sergeant major to CWO, depending on the size of the camp. Most soldiers refer to him as &quot;rasar&quot; (the Hebrew acronym for the rank of 2WO) without regarding his actual rank. Quartermasters are identified (in all IDF branches) by a blue and white aiguillette on the left shoulder.

===Switzerland===
In the Swiss Army, a quartermaster (Qm) is an officer (from 2 Lt. to colonel) in charge with the coordination of the (accountancy, post-service, fuel resupply, &quot;all sort of food&quot; resupply and others) of a battalion, regiment and brigade/division. His function is more a control and supervision function: a staff officer for the respective commander. The Qm has a direct subordinate at company level: it is the company quartermaster sergeant. The company quartermaster sergeant is known since the 18th century as or and has the rank equivalent of a senior non-commissioned-officer like the company sergeant major (since 2001 company chief sergeant major, CMS) and they are ranked (for better understanding in NATO-ranks even though Switzerland, as a neutral state, is not part of NATO) OR-7 in the senior NCO&#x27;s category (). For technical questions, the QMS is subordinated to the Qm officer (Qm 2 Lt, Qm 1 lt or Qm captain incorporated in the staff of a battalion/group). The tasks of resupply are assigned at company level to the two SNCO&#x27;s (CSM and QMS). The QMS is the material executor of the Qm tasks at company level and for the command chain together with the CSM, directly subordinated to the company commander (captain) as staff NCOs. The is also the substitute of the chief sergeant major (), if considering the command platoon by itself.

===United Kingdom===
In the British Army and Royal Marines, the quartermaster (QM) is the commissioned officer in a battalion or regiment responsible for supply. By longstanding tradition, they are always commissioned from the ranks and hold the rank of captain or major (although until the 20th century the quartermaster was usually a lieutenant). Some units also have a technical quartermaster, who is in charge of technical stores. The quartermaster is assisted by the regimental quartermaster sergeant (RQMS) (and the technical quartermaster by the technical quartermaster sergeant (TQMS)) and a staff of storemen. The QM, RQMS and storemen are drawn from the regiment or corps in which they work, not from the Royal Logistic Corps (or its predecessors), which is responsible for issuing and transporting supplies to them. Units which specialize in supply are known as &quot;supply&quot; units, not &quot;quartermaster&quot; units, and their personnel as suppliers or logistics specialists (&quot;log specs&quot;). Traditionally, the quartermaster had previously served as RQMS and then regimental sergeant major (RSM) of the unit of which he later became quartermaster.

===United States===
In the United States Army, the term is used to describe all supply personnel and units that are part of the United States Army Quartermaster Corps (USQMC), which was formerly the Quartermaster Department. It is a sustainment, formerly combat service support (CSS), branch of the United States Army. It is also one of three U.S. Army logistics branches, the others being the Transportation Corps and the Ordnance Corps.

==Navy use==

===Belgium===
In Belgium, the naval ranks of quartermaster, chief quartermaster, and first chief quartermaster are used.
===France===

In the French Navy, Quartermaster () is a junior rank, equivalent to a French Army and Air Force Corporal. The French rank has nothing to do with supplies. This rank is also used by many other navies based on the French Navy.

===Norway===
In the Norwegian navy, is a rank equal to an army sergeant.

===United Kingdom===
In the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies (Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, Indian Navy, and South African Navy), the quartermaster is the senior member of the gangway staff when the ship is alongside and is responsible for supervising the boatswain&#x27;s mate and the security of the brow. They are also responsible for steering the ship while at sea.

===United States===

The quartermaster is the enlisted member in charge of the watch-to-watch navigation and the maintenance, correction, and preparation of nautical charts and navigation publications. They are also responsible for navigational instruments and clocks and the training of ship&#x27;s lookouts and helmsmen. They perform these duties under the control of the ship&#x27;s navigator or other officer if there was no officer navigator. In the modern navy, a quartermaster is a petty officer who specializes in navigation. The rating abbreviation is QM. The symbol used for the rating and worn on uniforms is a . The colloquial form of address for a quartermaster is &quot;Wheels&quot;.

On U.S. Navy submarines, the job of a quartermaster is done by a qualified navigation electronics technician (NAV-ET). Along with the job of a Navy surface QM, NAV-ETs are also responsible for electronic systems that deal with navigation, internal communications, atmosphere monitoring, ship&#x27;s entertainment systems, re-circulatory air systems (ventilation) and remote valve indication or manipulation.

After 2004, the U.S. Navy disestablished the signalman rating (SM); signalmen were responsible for visual communications, and many of the personnel and their responsibilities were incorporated in the QM rating.

The U.S. Navy rating dealing with supply and logistics is logistics specialist (LS) which would be equivalent to the Army quartermaster.

====Coast guard====
The structure of ranks and job specialties of the United States Coast Guard is similar to that of the United States Navy. The Coast Guard used a quartermaster rating until the summer of 2003, when the rating was merged into the boatswain&#x27;s mate rating.

The Coast Guard&#x27;s quartermasters had the same duties as the Navy&#x27;s, with the exception that—at some point after World War II—the Coast Guard folded the duties of its signalman rating into the quartermaster rating. Also, in recent decades, quartermaster was one of the only two Coast Guard enlisted ratings permitted to hold command of a small boat station (command otherwise being reserved for officers), with the other enlisted man&#x27;s &quot;command rating&quot; being the boatswain&#x27;s mate.
=== NATO code ===
While the rank is used in a number of NATO countries, it is ranked differently depending on the country.

==Piracy==
Pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy elevated the rank of quartermaster to much higher powers and responsibilities than it had aboard non-pirate merchant or naval vessels. On pirate ships, the quartermaster was often granted a veto power by a pirate ship&#x27;s &quot;Articles of Agreement&quot;, in order to create an officer who could counterbalance the powers of the pirate captain. Pirate quartermasters, like pirate captains, were usually elected by their crews.

It was often the quartermaster&#x27;s responsibility to lead the pirate boarding party when boarding another ship. This was usually done from the quarterdeck (the place where two ships touched during the boarding attack).

The quartermaster ranked higher than any other officer aboard the ship except the captain himself, and could veto the captain&#x27;s decisions whenever the ship was not chasing a prize or engaged in battle. The quartermaster also was chiefly responsible for discipline, assessing punishments for crewmen who transgressed the articles.

According to pirate Captain Charles Johnson, ghost author of the 18th century source, &quot;A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates&quot;, aboard a pirate ship &quot;the Captain can undertake nothing which the Quarter-Master does not approve. We may say, the Quarter-Master is a humble Imitation of the Roman Tribune of the People; he speaks for, and looks after the Interest of the Crew&quot;.

Several quartermasters, notably among them Calico Jack Rackham, became captains after their previous captain was killed or deposed.

==Scouting==
A Scout quartermaster within the Scout movement is responsible for maintaining all the normal camping supplies in a Scout troop or pack. This may include, but is not limited to, camping supplies, tents, &quot;chuck boxes&quot; (containers holding food and cooking supplies), stoves, camp fuel (propane, naphtha, etc.), tarps, camping trailers, dining flys, etc.

The Quartermaster Award is also the highest rank in the Sea Scouts, BSA, an older youth (age 13–21) co-ed program. A quartermaster (kwartiermeester) is in the Netherlands the assistant patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Bak), in Flanders it is the patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Kwartier).

<text>Bere Regis () is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England, situated north-west of Wareham. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 1,745.

The village has one shop, a family-owned cheese barn, a post office, and two pubs, The Royal Oak and The Drax Arms. The parish church is St. John the Baptist Church. The village features in the Domesday Book of 1086.

==History==

Woodbury Hill, east of Bere Regis village, is the site of an Iron Age contour hill-fort, the ramparts of which enclose on a flat-topped spur of land.

The original settlements in the parish were Shitterton, Bere Regis village and Dodding&#x27;s Farm, which are all sited by the Bere or Milborne Stream. Later settlements were small farms in the Piddle Valley to the south, first recorded between the mid 13th and mid 14th centuries.

Edward I made Bere Regis a free borough and it was an important market town for a long period, though all domestic buildings built before 1600 have since been destroyed by serious fires in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.

==Governance==

Bere Regis is in an electoral ward that bears its name and includes neighbouring Bloxworth. The ward population in the 2011 census was 1,945. The ward forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Mid Dorset and North Poole. Its Member of Parliament since 2024 is the Liberal Democrat Vikki Slade.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Bere Regis is part of the West Purbeck ward which elects 2 members to Dorset Council.

It is formerly governed by Purbeck District Council and Bere Regis Parish Council at the parish level. The parish council meets once per month.

==Geography==

Bere Regis village is sited by the side of the small Bere River or Bere Stream, a tributary of the River Piddle, where the chalk of the Dorset Downs, to the north, dips beneath newer deposits of clay, sands and gravels. The village is situated at the western terminus of the A31 road (Guildford – Bere Regis), where it joins the A35 (Southampton – Honiton), although both roads now bypass the village. The local travel hubs are Wareham railway station, from the village, and Bournemouth Airport, away.

To the south-east of the village a large conifer plantation, Wareham Forest, stretches several miles to Wareham. To the west is Dorchester, north is Blandford Forum and east is Bournemouth. Further to the south is the chalk ridge of the Purbeck Hills, and to the south is the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site on the English Channel.

==Architecture==

Having suffered extensive fires throughout its history, including the most serious in 1777, the village has lost many of its older buildings. There is, however, a selection of Georgian and Victorian buildings. The nearby hamlet of Shitterton, protected by the Bere River from the fires, still retains an extensive selection of older buildings, predominantly thatch. Amongst them is the oldest residential building in the parish; the 550-year-old Honeycombe Cottage.

The oldest parts of the parish church of St John the Baptist are of the 12th century, but additions were made in the following three centuries. The tower is built of stone-and-flint chequerwork, and the timber roof of the nave is said to have been the gift of Cardinal John Morton. Features of interest include the arcades, some 16th-century seating and a number of Purbeck marble monuments. The Victorian and later stained glass is of poor quality.
==Demography==

In the 2011 census Bere Regis civil parish had 852 dwellings, 803 households and a population of 1,745 (867 male, 878 female).

==Education==

The village has one village school: Bere Regis Primary &amp; Pre-School located in Southbrook. This is a mixed primary school for children aged 4–10.

==Literature==

The village featured in several novels of Thomas Hardy, most notably, &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;. The village was portrayed as &#x27;Kingsbere&#x27;, and the D&#x27;Urberville family was based on the Turberville family of Bere Regis. This family name has evolved to Turbyfill.

==Sport and recreation==

Bere Regis has an active village sports club and playing fields which can be used for different sports. Bere Regis FC are one of the oldest Football Clubs in England and in Dorset, having been formed in 1885 when they were known as the &#x27;Arabs&#x27;. They are a well established team.

<doc id="1071272" wikidata="Q2407757" url="?curid=1071272" title="Bettiscombe">
<text>Bettiscombe is a small village and civil parish in west Dorset, England, situated in the Marshwood Vale west of Beaminster. Dorset County Council&#x27;s 2013 mid-year estimate of the population of the civil parish is 50.

==History==
The parish church, dedicated to St Stephen, has two windows in the chancel and possibly one in the west tower dating from about 1400, although the rest of the structure was rebuilt by John Hicks in 1862.

==Skull legend==
Bettiscombe Manor, a manor house in the village, is known as &quot;The House of the screaming skull&quot; due to a legend dating from the 19th century. Other ghost stories are also associated with the manor. The legend maintains that the skull is that of a Jamaican slave belonging to John Frederick Pinney.

Azariah Pinney&#x27;s descendants disposed of their Nevis estates and returned to the family home of Bettiscombe Manor in 1830, accompanied by one of the family&#x27;s black slaves. While in his master&#x27;s service, the servant was taken seriously ill with suspected tuberculosis. As he lay dying, the servant swore that he would never rest unless his body was returned to his homeland of Nevis, but when he died, John Frederick Pinney refused to pay for such an expensive burial and instead had the body interred in the grounds of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church cemetery. After the burial, ill fortune plagued the village for many months and screams and crying were heard coming from the cemetery. Other disturbances were reported from the manor house, such as windows rattling and doors slamming of their own accord. The villagers went to the manor to seek advice. The body of the servant was exhumed and the body taken to the manor house. In the process of time the skeleton has long since vanished, except for the skull.

In 1963 a professor of human and comparative anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons stated that the skull was not that of a black man but that of a European female aged between twenty-five and thirty.

<text>Bincombe is a small village, or hamlet, and civil parish in Dorset, England, north of Weymouth. The village is from Upwey railway station and from Bournemouth International Airport. The main road running through the village is Icen Lane. The civil parish, which includes a small part of the settlement of Broadwey to the west, had a population of 514 in the 2011 census.

The village stands on a limestone ridge south of Dorchester. Holy Trinity Church dates from the early 13th century.

Large military camps for the observation of the English Channel were formed on the hills in this parish in the reign of George III, and two deserters, in trying to escape with details of the different camps, were captured in the English Channel, tried by court martial and shot on Bincombe Down. Their remains are buried in the churchyard, where the stone can still be seen. The same incident, differently interpreted, forms the basis of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Melancholy Hussar of the German Legion&quot;.

The Master and Fellows of Caius College, Cambridge, are the principal landowners.

<text>A finite-state transducer (FST) is a finite-state machine with two memory &quot;tapes&quot;, following the terminology for Turing machines: an input tape and an output tape. This contrasts with an ordinary finite-state automaton, which has a single tape. An FST is a type of finite-state automaton (FSA) that maps between two sets of symbols. An FST is more general than an FSA. An FSA defines a formal language by defining a set of accepted strings, while an FST defines a relation between sets of strings.

An FST will read a set of strings on the input tape and generate a set of relations on the output tape. An FST can be thought of as a translator or relater between strings in a set.

In morphological parsing, an example would be inputting a string of letters into the FST, the FST would then output a string of morphemes.

==Overview==
An automaton can be said to &quot;recognize&quot; a string if we view the content of its tape as input. In other words, the automaton computes a function that maps strings into the set {0,1}. Alternatively, we can say that an automaton &quot;generates&quot; strings, which means viewing its tape as an output tape. On this view, the automaton generates a formal language, which is a set of strings. The two views of automata are equivalent: the function that the automaton computes is precisely the indicator function of the set of strings it generates. The class of languages generated by finite automata is known as the class of regular languages.

The two tapes of a transducer are typically viewed as an input tape and an output tape. On this view, a transducer is said to &quot;transduce&quot; (i.e., translate) the contents of its input tape to its output tape, by accepting a string on its input tape and generating another string on its output tape. It may do so nondeterministically and it may produce more than one output for each input string. A transducer may also produce no output for a given input string, in which case it is said to &quot;reject&quot; the input. In general, a transducer computes a relation between two formal languages.

Each string-to-string finite-state transducer relates the input alphabet Σ to the output alphabet Γ. Relations &quot;R&quot; on Σ*×Γ* that can be implemented as finite-state transducers are called rational relations. Rational relations that are partial functions, i.e. that relate every input string from Σ* to at most one Γ*, are called rational functions.

Finite-state transducers are often used for phonological and morphological analysis in natural language processing research and applications. Pioneers in this field include Ronald Kaplan, Lauri Karttunen, Martin Kay and Kimmo Koskenniemi.
A common way of using transducers is in a so-called &quot;cascade&quot;, where transducers for various operations are combined into a single transducer by repeated application of the composition operator (defined below).

==Formal construction==

Formally, a finite transducer &quot;T&quot; is a 6-tuple () such that:

* is a finite set, the set of &quot;states&quot;;
* is a finite set, called the &quot;input alphabet&quot;;
* is a finite set, called the &quot;output alphabet&quot;;
* is a subset of , the set of &quot;initial states&quot;;
* is a subset of , the set of &quot;final states&quot;; and
* formula_1 (where ε is the empty string) is the &quot;transition relation&quot;.

We can view (&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;) as a labeled directed graph, known as the &quot;transition graph&quot; of &quot;T&quot;: the set of vertices is &quot;Q&quot;, and formula_2 means that there is a labeled edge going from vertex &quot;q&quot; to vertex &quot;r&quot;. We also say that &quot;a&quot; is the &quot;input label&quot; and &quot;b&quot; the &quot;output label&quot; of that edge.

NOTE: This definition of finite transducer is also called &quot;letter transducer&quot; (Roche and Schabes 1997); alternative definitions are possible, but can all be converted into transducers following this one.

Define the &quot;extended transition relation&quot; formula_3 as the smallest set such that:

* formula_4;
* formula_5 for all formula_6; and
* whenever formula_7 and formula_8 then formula_9.

The extended transition relation is essentially the reflexive transitive closure of the transition graph that has been augmented to take edge labels into account. The elements of formula_3 are known as &quot;paths&quot;. The edge labels of a path are obtained by concatenating the edge labels of its constituent transitions in order.

The &quot;behavior&quot; of the transducer &quot;T&quot; is the rational relation [&quot;T&quot;] defined as follows: formula_11 if and only if there exists formula_12 and formula_13 such that formula_14. This is to say that &quot;T&quot; transduces a string formula_15 into a string formula_16 if there exists a path from an initial state to a final state whose input label is &quot;x&quot; and whose output label is &quot;y&quot;.

===Weighted automata===

Finite State Transducers can be weighted, where each transition is labelled with a weight in addition to the input and output labels. A Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) over a set &quot;K&quot; of weights can be defined similarly to an unweighted one as an 8-tuple , where:
* are defined as above;
* formula_17 (where &quot;ε&quot; is the empty string) is the finite set of transitions;
* formula_18 maps initial states to weights;
* formula_19 maps final states to weights.
In order to make certain operations on WFSTs well-defined, it is convenient to require the set of weights to form a semiring. Two typical semirings used in practice are the log semiring and tropical semiring: nondeterministic automata may be regarded as having weights in the Boolean semiring.

===Stochastic FST===
Stochastic FSTs (also known as probabilistic FSTs or statistical FSTs) are presumably a form of weighted FST.

==Operations on finite-state transducers==

The following operations defined on finite automata also apply to finite transducers:

* Union. Given transducers and , there exists a transducer formula_20 such that formula_21 if and only if formula_11 or formula_23.
* Concatenation. Given transducers and , there exists a transducer formula_24 such that formula_25 if and only if there exist formula_26 with formula_27 and formula_28
* Kleene closure. Given a transducer , there might exist a transducer formula_29 with the following properties:
:: and formula_30 does not hold unless mandated by () or ().
* Composition. Given a transducer on alphabets Σ and Γ and a transducer on alphabets Γ and Δ, there exists a transducer formula_31 on Σ and Δ such that formula_32 if and only if there exists a string formula_16 such that formula_11 and formula_35. This operation extends to the weighted case.

:This definition uses the same notation used in mathematics for relation composition. However, the conventional reading for relation composition is the other way around: given two relations and , formula_36 when there exist some such that formula_37 and formula_38

* Projection to an automaton. There are two projection functions: formula_39 preserves the input tape, and formula_40 preserves the output tape. The first projection, formula_39 is defined as follows:

: Given a transducer , there exists a finite automaton formula_42 such that formula_42 accepts &quot;x&quot; if and only if there exists a string &quot;y&quot; for which formula_44

:The second projection, formula_40 is defined similarly.

* Determinization. Given a transducer , we want to build an equivalent transducer that has a unique initial state and such that no two transitions leaving any state share the same input label. The powerset construction can be extended to transducers, or even weighted transducers, but sometimes fails to halt; indeed, some non-deterministic transducers do not admit equivalent deterministic transducers. Characterizations of determinizable transducers have been proposed along with efficient algorithms to test them: they rely on the semiring used in the weighted case as well as a general property on the structure of the transducer (the twins property).
* Weight pushing for the weighted case.
* Minimization for the weighted case.
* Removal of epsilon-transitions.

==Additional properties of finite-state transducers==

* It is decidable whether the relation [&quot;T&quot;] of a transducer &quot;T&quot; is empty.
* It is decidable whether there exists a string &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;[&quot;T&quot;]&quot;y&quot; for a given string &quot;x&quot;.
* It is undecidable whether two transducers are equivalent. Equivalence is however decidable in the special case where the relation [&quot;T&quot;] of a transducer &quot;T&quot; is a (partial) function.
* If one defines the alphabet of labels formula_46, finite-state transducers are isomorphic to NDFA over the alphabet formula_47, and may therefore be determinized (turned into deterministic finite automata over the alphabet formula_48) and subsequently minimized so that they have the minimum number of states.

==Applications==

FSTs are used in the lexical analysis phase of compilers to associate semantic value with the discovered tokens.

Context-sensitive rewriting rules of the form &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; / &quot;c&quot; _ &quot;d&quot;, used in linguistics to model phonological rules and sound change, are computationally equivalent to finite-state transducers, provided that application is nonrecursive, i.e. the rule is not allowed to rewrite the same substring twice.

Weighted FSTs found applications in natural language processing, including machine translation, and in machine learning. An implementation for part-of-speech tagging can be found as one component of the OpenGrm library.

<doc id="1071315" wikidata="Q5575341" url="?curid=1071315" title="Goat locker">
<text>In , the goat locker is a lounge, sleeping area, and galley on board a naval vessel which is reserved for the exclusive use of chief petty officers. By tradition, all other personnel, including officers and even the commanding officer, must request permission to enter the goat locker.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;goat locker&quot; takes its origins from wooden ship sailing times, when goats were kept aboard ship. The goat was used for its ability to consume nearly all forms of refuse, and produce milk for the crew. The quarters for the goat were traditionally in the Chief Petty Officer mess, which inherited the moniker &quot;goat locker&quot;. In modern times, &quot;goat locker&quot; represents any gathering place, on- or off-ship, where Chief Petty Officers hold private functions.

== Special dinnerware ==
The United States Navy, in respect for the position of Chief Petty Officers, formerly provided dinnerware made specifically for the goat locker.

The special insignia (topmark) used on this china to denote the Chief Petty Officer&#x27;s Mess were the letters &quot;USN&quot; beneath the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;Fouled, Fluked, and Stocked Anchor&quot;.

Official china was produced for the US Navy by manufacturers such as Tepco, Shenango, Buffalo, Sterling and Homer Laughlin from the early 1930s through World War II, and was used until the 1960s when inventories were consumed. This Navy china made for the Chief Petty Officer&#x27;s &quot;Goat Locker&quot; is rare, as it is typically kept as an heirloom passed down through generations.

<text>Lisa Kennedy Montgomery (born September 8, 1972), referred to mononymously as Kennedy, is an American libertarian political commentator, radio personality, author, and former MTV VJ. She is a commentator on Fox News Channel, a primary guest host of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Outnumbered&quot; and &quot;The Five,&quot; host of the podcast &quot;Kennedy Saves The World&quot; on Fox News Radio and a columnist for The Daily Mail. Kennedy was the host of MTV&#x27;s now-defunct daily late-night alternative-rock program &quot;Alternative Nation&quot; throughout much of the 1990s. She hosted &quot;Kennedy&quot; on the Fox Business Network from 2015 to 2023.

==Early life==
Lisa Kennedy Montgomery was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and raised in Lake Oswego, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. Kennedy and her two brothers were raised by her mother. She is of Romanian and Scottish descent. She attended Lakeridge High School. She attended Santa Monica College before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles; she later completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 2005.

Kennedy interned as a DJ at KROQ radio in Los Angeles as a teenager. She was known on KROQ as &quot;the Virgin Kennedy&quot;.

==Career==
Kennedy began her career as a VJ on MTV in 1992. She hosted &quot;Alternative Nation&quot; from 1992 to 1997. By 1995, she had become such a recognizable cultural figure that the sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; introduced a new character named McGovern, modeled after her.

In 1999, Kennedy published her book &quot;Hey Ladies! Tales and Tips for Curious Girls&quot;, in which she incorporated a multitude of personal experiences. That same year, she moved to Seattle to host &quot;The Buzz&quot; on KQBZ radio; the show was a mix of news, local issues, and comedy. Montgomery left Seattle in 2001 to cohost a morning radio show with Ahmet Zappa on the Comedy World Radio Network, &quot;The Future with Ahmet &amp; Kennedy&quot;, a similar mix of current events and comedy. She later co-hosted a morning show with Malibu Dan, &quot;The Big House&quot;.

Beginning June 3, 2002, Kennedy hosted Game Show Network&#x27;s &quot;Friend or Foe?&quot;, which ran for two seasons. On April 1, 2003, she guest-hosted the GSN show &quot;WinTuition&quot; as part of GSN&#x27;s April Fools prank where hosts swap places, while the original hosts usually appear as cameos, and play as contestants in &quot;Lingo&quot; for charity. She also hosted GSN&#x27;s &quot;Who Wants to Be Governor of California?&quot;, a televised debate among fringe candidates in the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, such as actors Gary Coleman and Mary Carey.

Beginning September 23, 2005, Kennedy appeared as an occasional panelist on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Best Week Ever&quot; and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Scarborough Country&quot;. In October 2005, she became host of Fox Reality&#x27;s &quot;Reality Remix&quot; until that series ended in June 2008.

In December 2007, she guest-hosted the evening show several times on Los Angeles talk-radio station KFI, before being hired by the station for a regular Sunday-afternoon show. In April 2008, she joined Bryan Suits as cohost of the &quot;Kennedy &amp; Suits Show&quot; at that station through September 30, 2009. She hosted &quot;Music in the Mornings&quot; on KYSR in Los Angeles from 2009 until March 2014.

On January 18, 2011, she began appearing as Anthony Sullivan&#x27;s assistant on &quot;PitchMen&quot;, looking for new inventions to promote in infomercials.

Kennedy joined Fox Business Network as a contributor in 2012. She co-hosted &quot;The Independents&quot;, a current-events and political discussion show, from its debut on December 9, 2013. The show was cancelled in January 2015, but she continued as host of her own program, &quot;Kennedy&quot;. &quot;Kennedy&quot; was put on hiatus March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 19, 2020, the program ended its seven-month hiatus. On May 31, 2023, Fox Business announced that it would be ending &quot;Kennedy&quot; after 8 years. She continues to serve as a regular guest/host on Fox News.

Following the cancellation of &quot;Kennedy&quot; on FBN, Kennedy announced that her podcast &quot;Kennedy Saves The World&quot; would be putting out episodes Monday-Friday at 7 p.m. EST beginning on June 26, 2023.

She is also a contributor to Reason.com and Reason.tv, and occasionally serves as guest host for Bill Carroll, John and Ken, and Tim Conway Jr. on KFI. She was a correspondent on the Fox Business talk show &quot;Stossel&quot;, and made occasional appearances as a panelist and guest host on Fox News&#x27; &quot;Red Eye&quot;. She makes appearances on other Fox talk shows, such as &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, &quot;The Five&quot;, and &quot;Gutfeld&quot;!.

Kennedy served as a regular host of &quot;Fox News Saturday Night&quot; from June 2023 through January 2024.

==Politics==
Kennedy is registered as unaffiliated.
She is a supporter of same-sex marriage, and officiated at the wedding of fellow Fox contributor Guy Benson to husband Adam Wise. She also supports privatization of Social Security. She opposes the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and bureaucratic regulation. 

Kennedy described herself as an &quot;ardent Republican&quot; in 1994. At MTV&#x27;s 1993 Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Inaugural Ball for Bill Clinton, she chanted, &quot;Nixon now! Nixon now!&quot; whenever the Clintons went on stage. Along with being a fan of Richard Nixon, she supported Dan Quayle and Bob Dole. She was a speaker at the 1996 Republican National Convention.

She later abandoned social conservatism, saying, &quot;Social conservatism was really bringing me down, and I realized, as time went on, that I wasn&#x27;t a Bush conservative. I was really a libertarian.&quot; She was first introduced to libertarianism when Kurt Loder suggested she read Ayn Rand&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot;. She actively supported Gary Johnson in both the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.

In March 2012, &quot;Reason&quot; published an article by Kennedy saying atheism is a religion on par with theistic religions. In 2014, according to Robert Draper, her show is not pro-Republican; it &quot;bash[es] not only &#x27;Obamacare&#x27; but also the N.S.A., neoconservatives and social scolds.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kennedy is divorced from former professional snowboarder Dave Lee; the couple has two daughters.

Prior to 1995, Kennedy dated Goo Goo Dolls frontman and guitarist John Rzeznik. The song &quot;Name&quot; was written about her.

She has the Romanian flag tattooed on her left ankle, and a pink Republican elephant tattooed on her upper left thigh.

In September 2012, during an appearance on &quot;Red Eye&quot;, Kennedy said she had been diagnosed with celiac disease, leading her to change to a more meat-based diet.

Kennedy is a triathlete.

At the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards, Kennedy was involved in an on-air verbal altercation with host Roseanne Barr over a fellatio joke involving Rush Limbaugh.

Excerpts from Kennedy&#x27;s segment on Fox were featured in the &quot;Now this&quot; segment of the thirteenth episode of season 11 of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.

<text>Ourinhos is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 114,352 (2020 est.) in an area of . The elevation is .

The municipality of Ourinhos was created in 1919 by separating it from Salto Grande. One version of its etymology is that the name &quot;Ourinhos&quot; (small gold pebbles) is a reference to the old city of Ourinho, on the other side of the Paranapanema river, which today is Jacarezinho, in Paraná state. Today, the city is formed by the town of Ourinhos, which is the only district headquarters, also subdivided into about 120 neighborhoods. It is also one of the main cities in São Paulo state&#x27;s SW region, having trade and services as its main economic activities. In agriculture, sugar cane, soy, and corn (maize) are the main crops.

The city also has an important cultural tradition that goes from arts and crafts to theater, music and sports. The city also stands out in its promotion of cultural and economic events and fairs often organized by the city hall and with the help of local companies. The major one is the Ourinhos Agricultural and Industrial Fair (FAPI), which is held annually in June and is considered one of the largest events of this nature in Brazil.

The city is served by Jornalista Benedito Pimentel State Airport.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Predrag Koraksić Corax (; born 15 June 1933) is a Serbian political caricaturist.

==Name signature==
He writes his signature Corax using Latin characters and spelling.

==Biography==
Koraksić was born on 15 June 1933 in Gornja Gorevnica, near Čačak. His parents are Stojan and Zorka (née Borić), who were teachers. His father, who was also one of the Partisan Movement leaders, was killed during the World War II by Chetniks in 1941. Corax spent four years as a refugee.

After the war Corax graduated from the grammar school in Zemun and studied architecture in Belgrade, but dropped out in his third year of studies. Corax started his professional cartoonist career in 1950 in newspaper &quot;Jež&quot;. Afterwards, Corax worked for &quot;Večernje novosti&quot;, from which he was expelled after the court process in 1993.

Since 1989, Corax worked for the independent newspaper &quot;Borba&quot;, but moved to &quot;Danas&quot;, where he still works, when Borba was taken over by the Serbian government. From 1990 until 2005 he was working for magazine &quot;Vreme&quot;, where he was a member of the editorial board.

==Cartoons==
Corax&#x27;s cartoons are humorous accounts of contemporary, mostly Serbian, political events. He rarely uses any written text in his cartoons, but relies on caricatures of politicians for the message be self-explanatory. His strips are currently being published frequently by Serbian newspaper Danas.

He is a prominent cartoonist in Serbia, as his cartoons are published in well known publications and his style is easily recognized. He also published several books, among which are: the &quot;Past Continuous Tense&quot; () and the &quot;Phenomenon of Rusty Spoon&quot; (), covering political life in Serbia from 1990 to 2016 in caricatures form. For his works he said that throughout his career: &quot;(he) took care that the caricature should not offend anyone, not to be excessive, not to insult, but to be ridicule, irony, that a person laughs&quot;. Commenting on inspiration for making cartoons about politicians, he said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been always driven mad by arrogance, which is actually a dominant characteristic of those people, ruthlessness, lies, deceit... and especially nationalism.&quot;

Throughout career, his sarcastic cartoons about politicians have made a bunch of high-ranking officials of Serbia offended, that they even publicly criticized his work (in pretty negative way). Among them, most notable are at the time of Presidents of Yugoslavia Dobrica Ćosić, Slobodan Milošević and Vojislav Koštunica, and in recent years President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić. From time to time, political leaders have also tried to obstruct his work following the provocative cartoons aimed at them, by replacing main editors in newspapers where he works or by cancelling his art exhibitions in public libraries without proper explanation.

==Awards==
In October 2004, he was rewarded French Légion d&#x27;honneur. In December 2017, he was awarded with &quot;Dobar primer Novog Optimizma&quot; award.

==Personal life==
Koraksić is married to Branislava (née Galić), with whom he has two children - Tatjana and Uroš.

<doc id="1071335" wikidata="Q809093" url="?curid=1071335" title="Barry Sadler">
<text>Barry Allen Sadler (November 1, 1940 – November 5, 1989) was an American soldier, singer-songwriter and author. Sadler served as a Green Beret medic, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant. He served in the Vietnam War from late December 1964 to late May 1965. Most of his work has a military theme, and he is best known for his patriotic song &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot;, a No. 1 hit in 1966. He died at age 49 after being shot in the head in Guatemala City.

==Early life==
Sadler was born in Carlsbad, New Mexico, the second son of John Sadler and Bebe Littlefield of Phoenix, Arizona. According to Sadler&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;m a Lucky One&quot;, his father developed a successful plumbing and electrical business in Carlsbad and owned several farms in the area. He describes his mother as managing restaurants and bars, and at times, games in casinos.

The family relocated often. His parents divorced when Sadler was five, and his father died not long after at age 36 from a rare form of nervous system cancer. His mother moved her family around as she worked at temporary jobs in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.

==Career==
===Enlistment===
Sadler dropped out of high school in the tenth grade in Leadville, Colorado. In 1958, at 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He finished his General Educational Development certificate while in the Air Force. He trained as a radar technician in 1958 and was stationed in Japan. After his discharge in 1961, Sadler enlisted in the U.S. Army, and volunteered for Airborne and Special Forces, opting to be a medic.

===Wounded in action===
When he completed Airborne training, he underwent the lengthy training as a combat medic at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In May 1965, while he was on a combat patrol southeast of Pleiku in the Central Highlands, he was severely wounded in the knee by a feces-covered punji stick. Sadler dressed the wound with a cotton swab and an adhesive bandage, then completed the patrol; however, he subsequently developed a serious infection in his leg, and was evacuated to Clark Air Base Hospital in The Philippines. Doctors were forced to surgically enlarge the wound to drain it and to administer large doses of penicillin. Sadler returned to Fort Bragg where he made a complete recovery.

===The Ballad of the Green Berets===

Sadler recorded his famous song, &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot;, a patriotic tune about the Special Forces, in December 1965. The writer Robin Moore, author of the novel &quot;The Green Berets,&quot; which became a 1968 movie, &quot;The Green Berets,&quot; featuring John Wayne, helped Sadler with lyrics and with getting a recording contract with RCA Victor Records. &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; arranged as a choral version by Ken Darby was the title song of the movie. Moore also wrote an introduction to Sadler&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;m a Lucky One,&quot; which he dictated to Tom Mahoney and was published by the Macmillan Company in 1967. &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; was released by RCA Victor Records in January 1966, and became a fast-selling single, holding No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks from March 5 to April 2, 1966. The record sold more than nine million copies. The song was a great success in many U.S. cities; it scored five weeks at No. 1 on the weekly Good Guys music survey at WMCA, the top popular music radio station in New York during 1966. He sang it for his television debut on January 30 on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Sadler had recorded an album of similarly themed songs which he titled &quot;Ballads of the Green Berets&quot;. It sold a million copies during the first five weeks of its release. Sadler had a minor success later the same year when the similarly patriotic-themed single &quot;The &#x27;A&#x27; Team&quot; scored No. 28.

==Later years==
===Literary works===
Sadler was unable to score anything close to a major success with his other songs, though &quot;The A-Team&quot; was a Top 30 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart single during 1966. He was honorably discharged from the Army in May 1967, and moved with his family to Tucson, Arizona. After minor acting parts in four episodes of two TV western series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; and &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, and in the 1968 caper film &quot;Dayton&#x27;s Devils&quot; starring Rory Calhoun, he moved to Nashville and began writing pulp fiction novels. His popular Casca series is about the title character, Casca Rufio Longinius (a combination of Longinus and the Wandering Jew), supposedly the Roman soldier who thrust his lance into Christ&#x27;s side during the crucifixion. Casca is cursed to remain a soldier until the Second Coming. The novels feature Casca&#x27;s life from biblical times to the 20th century. Sadler wrote the first twenty-two books. After his death, the series was continued with books by other authors.

*List of works in the Casca novel series

===Death of Lee Emerson Bellamy===
On December 1, 1978, at about 11 p.m., Sadler shot a country music songwriter named Lee Emerson Bellamy with one bullet to the head. Bellamy died the next day. The shooting was the culmination of a month-long dispute the men had concerning Darlene Sharpe, who was Bellamy&#x27;s former girlfriend, and Sadler&#x27;s lover at the time. Bellamy made many harassing telephone calls to Sadler and Sharpe, had one violent confrontation in a Nashville bar&#x27;s parking lot, and threatened both their lives.

On the night in question, Bellamy made several threatening telephone calls, including one to the Natchez Trace Restaurant where Sadler and Sharpe were having dinner and drinks with two friends. This resulted in Sadler asking a bartender to telephone the police, who never responded. Bellamy later went to Sharpe&#x27;s apartment complex and knocked on the door. Sadler exited through a side door. On seeing Sadler, Bellamy fled to his van. It was at that time, Sadler testified, that he saw a flash of metal. Believing it to be a gun, he fired one shot. The bullet struck Bellamy right between the eyes, and he died several hours later in a Nashville hospital. It turned out that Bellamy was unarmed. According to court records, Sadler had then placed a handgun in Bellamy&#x27;s van, presumably to strengthen his claim of self-defense. After a plea bargain, on June 1, 1979, Sadler was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the death of Bellamy, and sentenced to from 4 to 5 years in prison. His legal team worked to lower the sentence, which a judge reduced to just 30 days in the county workhouse. He served 28 days. Sadler was sued for wrongful death by Bellamy&#x27;s stepson, and was ordered to pay compensation of about $10,000.

===Death===
Sadler moved to Guatemala City in 1984. He continued to write and publish his &quot;Casca&quot; books and produced a never-released self-defense video. On September 7, 1988, he was shot in the head while sitting in a cab in Guatemala City. His manager, family, and friends believed it to be a robbery. Sadler was flown to the United States by friends in a private jet.

He underwent surgery at the Nashville Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital, and remained in a coma for about six weeks. After emerging from the coma, Sadler was a quadriplegic and had suffered significant brain damage. He was finally released in January 1989, but his family reported him missing. A dispute over who would be his legal guardian erupted between his wife and mother and resulted in a judge mandating a psychiatric evaluation. A few days later he was found in time to be present at a competency hearing.

After being moved to the Cleveland VA Hospital for specialized treatment, he was removed from the hospital by two former Green Berets and his mother, Blanche (Bebe) Sadler. After a contentious court battle waged by his wife and children, a court in Tennessee ruled that Sadler be put under the care of an independent guardian. He was moved to the VA Hospital in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in February 1989, but he never recovered from his injury. He died there of cardiac arrest on November 5, 1989, four days after his 49th birthday. Barry Sadler was survived by his wife, Lavona, a daughter, Brooke, and two sons, Thor and Baron.

<doc id="1071347" wikidata="Q553113" url="?curid=1071347" title="Beatus of Liébana">
<text>Beatus of Liébana (; ) was a monk, theologian, and author of the &quot;Commentary on the Apocalypse&quot;, mostly a compendium of previous authorities&#x27; views on the biblical &quot;Book of Revelation&quot; or &quot;Apocalypse of John&quot;. This had a local influence, mostly in the Iberian Peninsula, up to about the 13th century, but is today remembered mainly for the 27 surviving manuscript copies that are heavily illustrated in an often spectacular series of miniatures that are outstanding monuments of Mozarabic art. Examples include the Morgan Beatus and Saint-Sever Beatus; these are covered further at the article on the book. Most unusually for a work of Christian theology, it appears that Beatus always intended his book to be illustrated, and he is attributed with the original designs, and possibly the execution, of the first illustrations, which have not survived.

Aside from his work, almost nothing is known about Beatus. He was a monk and probably an abbot at the monastery of Santo Toribio de Liébana, Cantabria, in the Kingdom of Asturias, the only region of Spain remaining outside of Muslim control. It is thought that he was probably one the large number of monastic refugees who moved north, to lands remaining under Christian rule after the Muslim conquest of southern and central Spain. Beatus appears to have been well known by his contemporaries. He was a correspondent with the notable Christian scholar, Alcuin, and a confidant of queen Adosinda, daughter of Alfonso I of Asturias and wife of Silo of Asturias. He was present when Adosinda took her vows as a nun in 785, the last record we have of his life. A supposed biography, the &quot;Life of Beatus&quot;, has been identified as a 17th-century fraud with no historical value.

For Beatus, the observation and reading of such works was a sacred action, akin to communion. Beatus treats the reading of the book as the same as the body, and so by reading the book, the reader is one with Christ. He also led the opposition against a Spanish variant of Adoptionism, the heretical belief that Christ was the son of God by adoption, an idea first propounded in Spain by Elipandus, the bishop of Toledo.

An important, and enduring, influence of Beatus seems to be that he established the idea in Spain that Iberia had been converted by the Apostle James.

==Apocalypse commentary==

He is best remembered today as the author of the &quot;Commentary on the Apocalypse&quot;, written in 776, then revised in 784 and again in 786. The &quot;Commentary&quot; is a work of erudition but without great originality, made up principally of extracts from the texts of Church authorities including Augustine of Hippo, Tyconius, Ambrose, Irenaeus, and Isidore of Seville. He relied most heavily on the lost &quot;Commentary&quot; by Tyconius, whose writing provided Beatus with much of the text for his work. Later versions added the commentary by Jerome on the Book of Daniel, and other material to most manuscripts.

The &quot;Commentary&quot; was popular in Iberia during the Middle Ages and survives in at least 32 manuscripts (usually called a &quot;Beatus&quot;) from the 9th through the 13th centuries. No contemporary copies of Beatus&#x27;s work have survived. Not all of the manuscripts are complete, and some exist only in fragmentary form. Twenty-six of these manuscripts are lavishly decorated and have been recognized as some of the best examples of the Mozarabic style of illumination.

===Beatus map===
Of special interest to cartographers is a world map included in the second book of the &quot;Commentary&quot;. Unlike most medieval maps which showed only the three known continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, the Beatus map also displayed a fourth, unknown continent. The original purpose of the map was evangelical, displaying the apostles preaching in every part of the world, including the fourth continent. The original map has been lost but several copies have survived, all featuring an eastern orientation and paradise with four rivers flowing from it.

==Adoptionism controversy==
Beatus was a vocal opponent of a Spanish variant of adoptionism, the belief that Christ was the son of God by adoption, an idea first put forward by Elipandus, Bishop of Toledo and Bishop Felix of Urgell on the Iberian Peninsula. Elipandus and Felix declared that Jesus, in respect to his human nature, was the adopted son of God by God&#x27;s grace, thus emphasizing the distinction between the divinity and the humanity of Christ. Beatus and other opponents of adoptionism, such as Alcuin and Paulinus II of Aquileia, feared that this view would so divide the person of the Savior that the reality of the incarnation would be lost. In addition, many theologians were concerned that this adoptionism was a new version of the Nestorianism advanced by Nestorius.

In 794, Elipandus attacked Beatus in a letter to the bishops of Gaul, calling Beatus a pseudo-prophet and accusing him of having falsely announced the imminent end of the world. In response to the controversy, Charlemagne called together the Council of Frankfurt in 794. The assembled bishops condemned adoptionism as a heresy and in 798, Pope Leo III confirmed the heresy of adoptionism.

<text>The Modern Antiquarian: A Pre-Millennial Odyssey Through Megalithic Britain is a guide book written by Julian Cope, published in 1998. It is written as a travelogue of British megalithic sites, including Stonehenge and Avebury. Types of artifacts catalogued include stone circles, hillforts and barrows.

==Details==
In the introduction Cope explains how a visit to Avebury Stone Circle inspired his enthusiasm for the subject. He was disappointed with the quality of available guidebooks, so decided to write his own. He visited and researched hundreds of sites over eight years, selecting about 300 of the most significant for the book.

The book is divided into two sections, the first being ten essays by Cope about various aspects of British Isles megalithic culture. The second and main part of the book is a geographically arranged gazetteer of the sites. Each entry includes field notes, directions, map references and photographs or drawings.

A documentary film of the same name was made for the BBC in mid-2000. A website based on the book was launched in 2000. It invites users to add their own knowledge, research and photographs of the ancient sites of Britain and Ireland and currently holds information on over 7,400 archaeological sites. As of 2004 the book had sold more than 40,000 copies.

In October 2004 Cope published the follow-up volume &quot;The Megalithic European&quot; on 300 sites scattered across Europe and Scandinavia.

<doc id="1071349" wikidata="Q497179" url="?curid=1071349" title="Nazaré, Portugal">
<text>Nazaré () is a Portuguese town and municipality located in the Oeste region, in the historical province of Estremadura, and in the Leiria District. The municipality has a population of 14,889 in an area of 82.43 km2, while the town itself has around 10,000 inhabitants.

It is one of the most popular seaside resorts in the Silver Coast (&quot;Costa de Prata&quot;).

The town of Nazaré consists of three neighbourhoods: &quot;Praia&quot; (along the beach), &quot;Sítio&quot; (an old village, on top of a cliff) and &quot;Pederneira&quot; (another old village, on a hilltop). &quot;Praia&quot; and &quot;Sítio&quot; are linked by the Nazaré Funicular, a funicular railway.

The present mayor is Walter Chicharro, a member of the Socialist Party. The municipal holiday is on 8 September, as part of the Our Lady Of Nazaré Festival, a ten-day religious and secular celebration with processions, bullfights, fireworks, folk dancing and a fair.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Nazaré&quot; is the Portuguese version of &quot;Nazareth&quot;, the biblical city in the Holy Land.

== History and legend ==

The earliest settlements were in Pederneira and in Sítio, above the beach. They provided the inhabitants with refuge against raids by Viking and, later, French, English and Dutch pirates, that lasted until as late as the beginning of the 19th century. In fact, only in the 19th century, with the gradual end of maritime piracy, was possible for the people to start occupying the &quot;Praia&quot; which is today considered the town center.

According to the Legend of Nazaré, the town derives its name from a small wooden statue of the Virgin Mary, brought from Nazareth, Holy Land, to a monastery near the city of Mérida, Spain, by a monk in the 4th century. The statue was brought to its current location in 711 by another monk, Romano, accompanied by Roderic, the last Visigoth king of today&#x27;s Portugal. After their arrival at the seaside they decided to become hermits. Romano lived and died in a small natural grotto, on top of a cliff above the sea. After his death and according to his wishes, the king buried him in the grotto. Roderic left the statue of the Black Madonna in the grotto on an altar.

The first church in &quot;Sítio&quot; was built over the grotto to commemorate a miraculous intervention in 1182 by the Virgin Mary, which saved the life of the 12th-century Portuguese knight Dom Fuas Roupinho (possibly a templar) while he was hunting deer one morning in a dense fog. The episode is usually referred to as the Legend of Nazaré. In memory of the miracle he had a chapel (&quot;Capela da Memória&quot;) built over the small grotto, where the miraculous statue had been placed by king Roderic. Beside the chapel, on a rocky outcrop 110 meters above the Atlantic, one can still see the mark made in the rock by one of the hooves of Dom Fuas&#x27; horse. This Church of Nazareth, high on the rocky outcrop over Pederneira Bay, was noted as a landmark in sailors&#x27; manuals.

In 1377, King Fernando I of Portugal founded a new, more spacious church, which was totally transformed between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Nazaré is a rich baroque building, with splendid tiles on its interior. Behind and above the main altar, visitors can see and venerate the miraculous statue of Our Lady of Nazaré. The religious figures are crowned by 18th century diadems, presented to the church by King John VI. The sacred image is wrapped with a green cloak decorated with gold, gifted to the Virgin Mary by King John V. The main chapel is separated from the body of the church with an arcade made from &quot;pau-santo&quot; and a few pillars decorated with mosaics in 19th century Italian marble.

=== Economy ===
The Nazarene coastline is among the most dangerous in the world with its high waves, with local fishermen that have braved them for centuries. The town’s reliance on the sea for food production and economic viability is a result of the unique climate that differs from the surrounding Mediterranean eco-zone where land-farming is more common. Fishing in Nazaré is an activity carried out entirely by the village men, leaving the women to run daily life and daily governance in the town. These distinctly gendered roles and adherence to rudimentary fishing practices are widely believed to be the primary reason the town has not yet developed into a modern industrial society.

==Geography==
The municipality of Nazaré borders the Atlantic to the west and is surrounded entirely by the municipality of Alcobaça to the north, east and south.

===Climate===

Nazaré has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The town&#x27;s climate is moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and the seasonal upwelling phenomena typical of western Portugal gives it cool to warm, dry and overall sunny summers. As a result of the marine layer, morning and evening fogs are very frequent in the summer and can persist all day on rare occasions. The seasonal downwelling on the other hand is most common in the winter and gives Nazaré a more unstable, Atlantic dominated weather with often overcast, rainy and stormy days, clear days, however, are not uncommon in this season. Temperatures above or below are very uncommon. Nazaré also experiences some seasonal lag, with temperatures in September being warmer than those in June.

===Human geography===
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 3 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Famalicão
* Nazaré
* Valado dos Frades

==Culture==
===Tourism===

Over the 20th century, Nazaré progressively evolved from a fishing village to a point of interest among Portuguese and international tourists, advertising itself as a picturesque seaside village.

Located on the Atlantic coast, it has long sandy beaches, attracting many tourists in the summer. The town used to be known for the traditional costumes worn by the fishermen. Women traditionally wear a headscarf and flannel skirt, embroidered in seven different colours. The costumes are still worn occasionally.
It is quite visited due to the religious festivals dedicated to Our Lady of Nazaré, in which there are processions and also some profane celebrations.

Many of the tourists and Catholic pilgrims who visit Central Portugal, and especially the internationally famous Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (located nearby in Cova da Iria), go to Nazaré for a visit or to watch the surfing championships.

===Museums and cultural centers===
* Doctor Joaquim Manso Folk and Archeological Museum
* Sacred Art Museum of Reitor Luís Nesi
* Fisherman House-Museum
* Nazaré Bullring
* Nazaré Cultural Centre

===Surfing===

Nazaré is a popular surfing destination because of the high breaking waves that form due to the presence of the underwater Nazaré Canyon. The canyon increases and converges the incoming ocean swell which, in conjunction with the local water current, dramatically enlarges wave heights.

Due to the height of the waves, numerous surfing records have been set at Nazaré. In November 2011, surfer Garrett McNamara surfed a then-record-breaking giant wave measuring from trough to crest, at Praia do Norte, Nazaré. On 8 November 2017 Brazilian surfer Rodrigo Koxa broke the previous record by surfing a wave of . In October 2020, German surfer Sebastian Steudtner broke this record, riding a wave which was measured at .

There has been a marked increase in visitors to viewing points for surfing competitions, such as the lighthouse at the Fort of São Miguel Arcanjo, which has seen numbers increase from 80,000 visitors in 2015 to 174,000 in 2017.

On 18 January 2018, Brazilian big-wave surfer Maya Gabeira surfed a wave of 24.7 meters (74 feet).

On 5 January 2023, Brazilian professional surfer Márcio Freire died whilst practicing tow-in surfing.

== International relations ==
Nazaré is twinned with:
* Badajoz, Spain (since 1987)
* Nogent-sur-Marne, France (since 1993)
* Zushi, Japan (since 2004)

== Notable people ==

* Luis Soares (born 1964 in Nazaré), a long-distance runner, competed for France at the 1992 Summer Olympics
* Brothers Ricardo Esgaio (born 1993) &amp; Tiago Esgaio (born 1995), Portuguese footballers
* Brothers Mauro Eustáquio (born 1993) &amp; Stephen Eustáquio (born 1996), Canadian footballers

<text>Fort Coligny was a fortress founded by Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1555, in what constituted the so-called France Antarctique historical episode.

For protection against attacks by hostile Indians and the Portuguese, Villegaignon built the fortress with the help of the 500 colonists who travelled with him in two ships armed by the king of France, on a small island called Serigipe by the Indians of the region, near the mouth of the large Guanabara Bay. The island was rocky and almost barren, but served Villegaignon&#x27;s purpose of being near the shore, at the same time achieving a good defensive position against attacks from sea and land.

The fortress fell and was destroyed on March 17, 1560, under the siege of Portugal&#x27;s navy and troops under the command of Mem de Sá, third Governor-General of Brazil. Villegaignon had already returned to France, in 1558.

The fortress was named as such in honor of Villegaignon&#x27;s supporter and friend, the French Admiral and leader of the Huguenots, Gaspard de Coligny. After the foundation of Rio de Janeiro in 1565 by Estácio de Sá and the expulsion of the French in 1567 a new fortress was built there by the Portuguese, in order to defend the mouth of the Guanabara Bay, by crossing fire with two other fortresses, Guajará and Santa Cruz. This fortress was almost totally destroyed by bombardment in a revolt of the Navy, in 1893. Today, the island, which was renamed &quot;Island of Villegaignon&quot;, is home to the Naval School since 1938, and is now permanently connected to the continent, near the Santos Dumont Airport.

<text>The Estelada (; pl. &quot;Estelades&quot;; full name &quot;Senyera estelada&quot;, , from &quot;estel&quot;, &quot;star&quot;) is a flag flown by Catalan independence supporters to express their support for an independent Catalonia or independent &quot;Països Catalans&quot; (Catalan Countries, the Catalan-speaking territory, which includes Valencia and the Balearic Islands). 
The design of the &quot;Estelada&quot; comprises the red-and-yellow bars of the &quot;Senyera&quot;, with the addition of a five-pointed star in a triangle at the hoist.

The use of this flag as a protest symbol within Catalan nationalism has become more notable since the 1970s Spanish transition to democracy. The self-proclaimed Catalan Republic of 2017 did not adopt the Estelada as its national flag, instead using the regular Senyera.

== Design and meaning ==
The flag dates from the early 20th century; it was most probably designed in 1918 by Vicenç Albert Ballester i Camps. It came from combining the traditional four red stripes over a yellow field of the &quot;Senyera&quot; with a blue triangle at the hoist containing a five-pointed white star, inspired by the flags of Cuba, the Philippines and Puerto Rico. Later designs combine the &quot;Senyera&quot; with a yellow triangle at the hoist containing a five-pointed red star. In both designs the lone star motif means Catalan independence.

== History ==

The 3rd Article of the provisional Constitution of the Catalan Republic, written and approved in 1928 in Cuba by the &quot;Assemblea Constituent&quot; (Constituent Assembly) of Catalan separatism, specifically provided that the official flag of the Catalan Republic should consist of four red bars on a yellow field, superimposed with a white five-pointed star in a blue triangle.

The star in the flag comes from the early days of nationalism, the lone star symbolising national freedom and independence. Cuba&#x27;s fight for its independence was watched closely by the Catalanists of the nineteenth century and in 1906, when the Cuban War of Independence ended, the &quot;Centre Catalanista de Santiago de Cuba&quot; (Catalanist Centre of Santiago de Cuba) was created. An embryonic Catalan &quot;estelada&quot; flag could already be seen: in the middle of a &quot;senyera&quot; there was a white star with five points.

The first star with a clear nationalist intent known in Catalonia is from before 1904, associated with the &quot;Unió Catalanista&quot; (Catalanist Union). It is a stamp commemorating the acquisition of the &quot;Pi de les Tres Branques&quot; (Three-Branched Pine) by the Catalanist Union.

Later, in 1906, a star appeared in the nameplate of the magazine &quot;Fora Grillons!&quot; (Breaking Chains!), published in Santiago de Cuba by Catalan exiles - a publication that had already clearly proclaimed the independence of Catalonia.

During the late 1910s, once World War I was over, Europe saw a wave of new nation-states being created, with the assistance of President Woodrow Wilson.

The politics of the League of Nations (and later the United Nations) allowed many nations to seize the opportunity of independence, and Czechoslovakia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Iceland did so in 1918; other nations like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia, were declared independent, but were then immediately annexed by the Soviet Union.
From the nations that hoped for independence, pressure groups began to mobilize internationally. In the Catalan case, the &quot;Comitè Pro-Catalunya&quot; (Pro-Catalonia Committee) was one of the most active. It was in this context that a need was perceived to have a flag as a symbol of Catalan aspiration; and, of course, a star appeared on it. Since then the &quot;estelada&quot; flag began to be spoken of. It was probably designed by Vicenç Albert Ballester, with the blue triangle signifying the blue sky of humanity, and the white star symbolizing freedom.

The first photograph in which the flag appeared was in a publication dated the bulletin &quot;L’intransigent&quot; (The Intransigent) in 1918. It shows a group of young Americans and Catalan separatists holding both flags. Also in 1918, there was a comic strip in circulation—a stamp without postal value—dedicated to the future League of Nations, where there was also an &quot;estelada&quot;.

There are several kinds of &quot;estelada&quot;. One is in the last number of &quot;La Tralla&quot; (&quot;The Whip&quot;, a radical separatist magazine from the 1920s), before the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by Miguel Primo de Rivera. The other is in a document published by the &quot;Comitè Pro-Catalunya&quot; written in Catalan and Arabic, to greet and encourage one of the Moroccan leaders who revolted against Spain.

In Cuba, it appeared for first time in the nameplate of the magazine &quot;La Nova Catalunya&quot; (1920), (The New Catalonia). The &quot;estelada&quot; flag went on to appear in other Catalan separatist publications.

An &quot;estelada&quot; was owned by Francesc Macià during the failed invasion of Prats de Molló in 1926; it appeared between the imprisonment of the Catalan volunteers and their transfer to Paris to be put on trial. There are photographs of the volunteers with the &quot;estelada&quot; in several other places.

In 1928, with the presidency of Francesc Macià in the Constituent Assembly of the Catalan independence movement, the &quot;estelada&quot; was again seen, and the Catalan separatists made it their flag.

During this period a new practice began, and continues to the present day; whenever a prominent Catalan nationalist dies, as a sign of mourning, his comrades will cover the red bars of the &quot;estelada&quot; with a black cloth, leaving the star visible to signify that they will continue pursuing the same ideals.

Later, during the period from 1931 to 1936, the &quot;estelada&quot; still appears numerous times. Some of these flags only have two colours due to the shortage of money, but the traditional &quot;estelada&quot; with the blue triangle and white star was kept.

After the Francoist dictatorship came to power, the &quot;Front Nacional de Catalunya&quot; (National Front of Catalonia), or FNC, which used the Catalan flag and the &quot;estelada&quot;, was formed in response to the new Spanish nationalist regime.

During the sixties, in the university section of the FNC, there was a faction called the &quot;Partit Socialista d’Alliberament Nacional dels Països Catalans&quot;, (Socialist Party for the National Liberation of the Catalan Countries), or PSAN. Because this party wanted to make its own socialist and Marxist ideas clear, it decided to change the colour of the star to red; in 1969, this new version of the &quot;estelada&quot; started to appear at PSAN meetings.

In the mid-seventies, the PSAN had, in turn, its own splits. They led to the creation of a new movement, the &quot;Moviment d’Unificació Marxista&quot; (Movement of Marxist Unification), which started to use the red star inside a white triangle, while the PSAN kept the red star inside a yellow triangle.

The unification of the two versions of the flag could only take place when the Movement of Marxist Unification and the &quot;Bloc d’Esquerra d’Alliberament Nacional&quot; (Left National Liberation Bloc), or BEAN, both disbanded. At that time the flag with the red star and the yellow triangle were a symbol of both socialist and communist separatists.

== Current use ==

As of 2005 both kinds of &quot;Estelada&quot; flag (the classic and the red) are used at the same time.

After the Fall of Communism in Europe the red star of the &quot;Estelada groga&quot; (yellow estelada) has steadily lost some of its original leftist meaning, but not totally. It is sometimes currently flown just as a simpler and less cluttered version of the &quot;Estelada&quot; in the traditional Catalan colors. 

The estelada is ubiquitous as a simplified symbol - four vertical bars topped by a star, sprayed or daubed on walls, lampposts or mailboxes all over Catalonia. These simple graffiti are most often in one basic color, either in black or red. More elaborate large pro-independence graffiti use often the red-star &quot;Estelada&quot; as a symbol. 

In 2016, the Spanish government prohibited football fans from bringing esteladas to the Copa del Rey final match between Barcelona and Sevilla, held in Madrid. The government applied the article 2.1 of the Law on Sports, which prohibits the display of symbols that &quot;incite, foment or help violent or terrorist behavior.&quot; A Madrid judge overruled the ban after Barcelona complained, citing freedom of expression.

== Valencian nationalist Senyera ==

The Valencian nationalist Senyera, also known simply as &quot;Estrelada&quot;, is a flag of Valencian Community that evolved from the regional flag based on the former Catalan &quot;Estelada&quot;.

The white star version has been used by Valencian nationalist groups since the early 20th century. Some of these groups may be &quot;blaverist&quot; (Valencian regionalist, as opposed to Catalan nationalist) in their ideology, especially those with more pro-sovereign positions.

The oldest extant document showing this &quot;Estrelada&quot; - with a red star - is a war poster of the Valencian Left.

== Variations ==
Since its creation, various &quot;Estelades&quot;, or &quot;Estrelades&quot; (such as the Andalusian, Aragonese or Galician separatist flags) have been adopted by leftist separatist movements within Spain. Some &quot;Estelades&quot; have also been used for other purposes than separatism.

<text>OpenEdge Advanced Business Language, or OpenEdge ABL for short, is a business application development language created and maintained by Progress Software Corporation. Typically classified as a fourth-generation programming language, it utilizes an English-like syntax to simplify software development. The language was called PROGRESS or Progress 4GL up until version 9, but in 2006, PSC changed the name to OpenEdge Advanced Business Language (OpenEdge ABL), in order to overcome a presumed industry perception that 4GLs were less capable than other languages. 

OpenEdge ABL helps developers to develop applications optionally using its own integrated relational database and programming tools. These applications are portable across computing systems and allow access to various popular data sources without having to learn the underlying data access methods. This means that the end-user of these products can be unaware of the underlying architecture.

By combining a fourth-generation language and relational database, OpenEdge ABL allows the use of the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model for developing software. 

==History==
The original Progress 4GL was designed in 1981 as an architecture-independent language and integrated database system that could be used by non-experts to develop business applications by people who were not computer scientists but were knowledgeable in their business domain. At that time, business applications were often written in COBOL (for machines like corporate IBM mainframes) and sometimes in C (for departmental minicomputers running the UNIX operating system). When the IBM PC became popular, it developed a need for business software that could be used on those and other inexpensive computers. The Progress system was created to be used on both IBM PC machines running DOS and on a variety of computers that could run UNIX and minicomputer operating systems such as OpenVMS.

==Syntax and semantics==

Progress ABL is a strongly typed, late-bound, English-like programming language. Although initially designed as a procedural language, starting with version 10.1 it was enhanced with object-oriented grammar elements, which can be mixed with the original procedural style. A block of code may have a transaction scoped to it, in which case database changes will be committed when it completes. An error raised within such a block will undo these changes. These defaults may be overridden by the programmer.

Simple programs run without a graphical user interface, but there is syntax to create one programmatically, or programmers can use the provided tools to build one.

==Examples==

===Hello World===
The following ABL code creates a window with the text &quot;Hello, World!&quot; and a button labelled &quot;OK&quot;.

DEFINE VARIABLE w AS HANDLE NO-UNDO.

CREATE WINDOW w ASSIGN 
 WIDTH = 50
 HEIGHT = 5
 MESSAGE-AREA = FALSE
 STATUS-AREA = FALSE. 

CURRENT-WINDOW = w.

DEFINE BUTTON btnOK LABEL &quot;OK&quot; SIZE 12 BY 1.2.
FORM 
 &quot;Hello World!&quot; VIEW-AS TEXT AT COL 20 ROW 2
 btnOK AT COL 20 ROW 4
 WITH FRAME f SIZE 50 BY 5 NO-BOX THREE-D.

VIEW FRAME f.
ENABLE btnOK WITH FRAME f.
WAIT-FOR &quot;CHOOSE&quot; OF btnOK.
DELETE OBJECT w.
A message-box can be used to achieve the same effect:

MESSAGE &quot;Hello World!&quot;
 VIEW-AS ALERT-BOX INFO BUTTONS OK.

The codice_1 parameter controls the message icons, and can be replaced with codice_2 or codice_3 for different looks.

The most basic &quot;Hello, World&quot; program is:

DISPLAY &quot;Hello &quot;.
===SQL codice_4 equivalent===

The SQL statement:

SELECT * FROM customer;

(along with your chosen language connection and display procedures) can be expressed in Progress / ABL as:

FOR EACH customer NO-LOCK:
 DISPLAY customer.
END.
===SQL codice_5 equivalent===

The SQL statement:

UPDATE customer 
 SET salesman = &#x27;Fred&#x27;
 WHERE custno = 14;

(again, along with your chosen language connection and display procedures) can be expressed in Progress / ABL as:

FOR EACH customer WHERE customer.custno = 14 EXCLUSIVE-LOCK:
 ASSIGN customer.salesman = &#x27;Fred&#x27;.
END.
(Some assumptions have been made about indexing, locking and transaction scoping in order to keep this example simple.)

Data access in the ABL is record based as opposed to result-set based processing in traditional SQL-based languages. In SQL operations work on a set of records, in the ABL, the operation is applied to a record at a time - much like using a cursor in SQL. Record-based processing provides a clean and reliable locking mechanism which allows the developer to EXECUTIVE-LOCK, SHARE-LOCK or NO-LOCK a record when accessed by the application. 

==Application areas==

The language is used in a wide variety of application areas, some examples:

* Mortgage and Auto Loan Origination at US Banks 
* Rental Car Reservation Systems
* Manufacturing ERP 
* Wholesale Distribution ERP
* Warehouse Systems
* Transportation Systems
* Commercial Service Force Dispatching
* Security Card Systems
* Gaming Systems (think Las Vegas, not video)

OpenEdge can be used for:
* Microsoft Windows GUI (Graphical User Interface)
* WWW Programming (UNIX and Windows)
* CHUI (CHaracter User Interface) (UNIX and Windows)
* JSON and XML appserver programming (UNIX and Windows)
* as well background process programming (UNIX and Windows).

<doc id="1071369" wikidata="Q1436999" url="?curid=1071369" title="Ford Tempo">
<text>The Ford Tempo is a front-engine, front-drive, five passenger, two- or four-door sedan manufactured and marketed by Ford for model years 1984-1994, over a single generation. The successor of the Ford Fairmont, the Tempo marked both the downsizing of the Ford compact car line and its adoption of front-wheel drive. Through its production, the model line was offered as a two-door coupe and four-door sedan, with the Mercury Topaz marketed as its divisional counterpart (no Lincoln version was sold). 

Deriving its chassis underpinnings and powertrain from the Ford Escort, the Tempo was the first aerodynamically styled sedan introduced by Ford. First seen on the 1982 Ford Sierra hatchbacks (designed by Ford of Europe) and the 1983 Ford Thunderbird, the model line was followed by the 1986 Ford Taurus.

Produced across multiple facilities in North America, the Tempo/Topaz was produced in a single generation of two-doors; two generations of four-door sedans were produced. For the 1995 model year, the Tempo/Topaz four-door sedan was replaced by the Ford Contour (and Mercury Mystique), developed from the Ford Mondeo; the two-door Tempo was not directly replaced.

==Development==
In the late 1970s Ford began planning to replace their compact rear wheel drive Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr models with a new smaller front wheel drive (FWD) car. This new compact was expected to compete in the marketplace with General Motors&#x27; X-Body, but wound up more similar to GM&#x27;s J-cars. Ford&#x27;s chief development engineer for the new car was Ed Cascardo.

The Tempo and Topaz chassis shared some parts with the front-wheel-drive platform used on the first North American Ford Escort, but with a wheelbase stretched by and distinctive new bodies. There were few common components due to the Tempo and Topaz&#x27;s larger size. Switching to front-wheel drive freed up interior space that would have otherwise been lost to accommodate a driveshaft and rear differential.

Wind tunnel testing on the Tempo began in December 1978. More than 450 hours of testing resulted in over 950 different design changes. The Tempo and Topaz both featured windshields inclined at a 60° angle and aircraft-inspired door frames, two features that had both appeared on the Thunderbird and Cougar in 1983. The door frames wrapped up into the roofline, which improved sealing, allowed for hidden drip rails, and cleaned up the A-pillar area of the car. The rear track was widened, improving aerodynamic efficiency. The front grille was laid back and the leading edge of the hood was tuned for aerodynamic cleanliness. The wheels were pushed out to the corners of the body, reducing turbulence. The cars&#x27; backlights were also laid down at 60°, and the rear deck was raised, reducing drag and resulting in greater fuel efficiency. Viewed from the side, the raised trunk imparted a wedge stance to the car which was especially prominent on the two-door coupes. The aerodynamic work resulted in a coefficient of drag (formula_1) of 0.36 for the two-door Tempo, equal to that of the aero Ford Thunderbird. The four door returned a drag coefficient of 0.37.

The Tempo was designed for a four-cylinder engine, but all production of Ford&#x27;s 2.3 L Lima OHC four was committed to other product lines. In 1983 Ford had stopped production of their 200 cubic inch Thriftpower inline six, leaving unused capacity at the Lima Engine plant. Ford developed a four-cylinder engine that shared some features of the Thriftpower six, topped with a new cylinder head and using other new technologies, while repurposing as much tooling as possible at the Lima plant.

When the cars were released, a turbocharged version of the new four cylinder was said to be in development, but this engine never became available. At that point, a V6 was not being considered.

Released in 1983 as a 1984 model, more than 107,000 two-door Tempos and more than 295,000 four-door Tempos were sold in its first year.

==Features==
===Chassis and suspension===
The Tempo&#x27;s chassis is a steel unibody. The structure from the firewall forward is shared with the contemporary Ford Escort.

The Tempo&#x27;s front suspension on each side comprises a lower lateral link triangulated by the anti-roll bar and a coil over MacPherson strut. The rear &quot;Quadralink&quot; suspension is two parallel lower lateral control links and a radius rod per side, with coil over MacPherson struts. This differed from the Escort&#x27;s rear suspension, which used a lower lateral arm, radius rod, and non-concentric coil spring and shock absorber. The Tempo was the first ever American built Ford with an independent rear suspension using MacPherson struts.

Brakes are discs in front and drums in back.

Steering is by power assisted rack and pinion, with three turns lock-to-lock.

Standard tires on base models are 175/80R13, while higher trim levels have 185/70R14, and sportier models are fitted with Michelin TRX 185/65R365 metric tires on aluminum wheels.

===Powertrain===
The Tempo&#x27;s four cylinder gasoline engine is called the &quot;High Swirl Combustion&quot; (HSC) engine and displaces 2.3 L. It has a cast iron block and head, with a single cam-in-block and two overhead valves (OHV) per cylinder with pushrods and rocker arms. The HSC engine was also offered in a &quot;High Specific Output&quot; (HSO) version producing .

In 1992 the 3.0 L Ford Vulcan V6 engine became an option in the Tempo. Fitting the Vulcan V6 into the Tempo required changes to the water pump, and use of a more restrictive exhaust system that reduced maximum power.

The original base transmission in the gasoline fueled Tempo/Topaz is a four-speed IB4 manual that made up part of what Ford called the &quot;Fuel Saver&quot; powertrain. A five-speed MTX-III manual or a three-speed FLC automatic were optional upgrades.

From 1984 to 1986 a version of Mazda&#x27;s four-cylinder RF diesel engine was offered in the Tempo and Topaz. The only transmission paired with the diesel engine was the 5-speed manual.

===All Wheel Drive===
An optional All Wheel Drive (AWD) system became available in the Tempo and Topaz in 1987, and was offered until 1991. Although Ford had a long history with four wheel drive, and had built prototypes based on other car models before, the AWD Tempo was their first production passenger sedan to offer four wheel drive.

This design of part-time system is not meant for serious off-road driving, nor for use on dry streets. It is designed specifically to provide additional traction in slippery road conditions. The system is controlled by a rocker switch in the interior. When activated, the system engages a clutch which sends power to a limited-slip rear differential via a new driveshaft. There is no transfer case.

The all-wheel-drive system adds to the weight of the car, and increases ride height by just .

The only engine offered with the AWD option was the HSO four cylinder, with the 3-speed automatic transmission.

In 1991 Ford started referring to the system as &quot;Four Wheel Drive&quot; instead of All Wheel Drive.

==First generation (1984–1987)==


The first generation Tempo and Topaz were unveiled on the deck of the USS Intrepid, a decommissioned aircraft carrier that had been turned into a floating museum in New York Harbor. They were released on 26 May 1983 as 1984 models. An early advertisement for the car featured a Tempo sedan performing a 360 degree loop on a stunt track. The car in the ad was securely attached to a track, and was pulled through the shot rather than operating under its own power.

As Ford&#x27;s first downsized compact car, the Tempo arrived four years after GM&#x27;s compact X-Bodies in 1979 for the 1980 model years, and two and a half years after Chrysler&#x27;s compact K-cars were introduced. The four door Tempo had three windows in profile, somewhat similar to the European Ford Sierra, while the four-door Topaz received a more upright C-pillar without rear quarter windows. The front of the car featured two sealed-beam halogen headlamps in chrome trimmed recessed mounts, and the grille between them featured four thin horizontal slats, swept back to allow for greater air flow into the engine compartment and over the hood.

The first generation Tempo came standard with a four-cylinder 2.3 L gasoline engine or an optional Mazda-built 2.0 L diesel engine. In late 1985 the four speed manual transmission was discontinued and the five-speed became standard. A slight modification was made to the five-speed transmission, moving the &quot;reverse&quot; position in the shift pattern from right beside first gear to the opposite bottom corner to reduce the likelihood of mistakenly selecting reverse rather than first gear during takeoff. Other changes for 1985 included a redesigned instrument panel with passenger side shelf, side window demisters, and a redesigned driver&#x27;s pod with separate area for the radio. Also for 1985, the engine received a new central fuel injection (CFI) system, although the carbureted version was offered in Canada until 1987.

The instrument panel featured a new, easier to read gauge layout, with all switches and controls placed within easy reach of the driver.

In early 1985, the Tempo became the first production American automobile to feature a driver&#x27;s side airbag as a supplemental restraint system. In 1984, Ford entered a contract with the General Services Administration and the Department of Transportation to supply 5,000 airbag-equipped Tempos. Half also received a special windshield designed to minimize lacerations to passengers, and all were early recipients of the high-mounted brake lights that became required by law in 1986.

===1986 update===

In October 1985, the Tempo and the Topaz received several minor changes for the 1986 model year. The rectangular sealed-beam halogen headlamps were replaced with new, plastic composite enclosures with a replaceable lamp. The new headlights were flush-mounted to match the redesigned front corner lights and freshly restyled grille, which more closely matched that of the new Taurus that debuted in 1986, while the Topaz received a half pseudo-lightbar grille similar to the one on the upcoming Sable. In back, the trunk and taillights were slightly restyled.

In 1986, the Tempo surpassed the Hyundai Pony to become the best selling new car in Canada. A new &quot;LX&quot; luxury trim level replaced the GLX. An all-wheel-drive model was added for 1987 on both 2- and 4-door. It included all the interior amenities of the LX/LS models, and the HSO engine from the Sport (detailed below). An automatic transaxle was standard, and the AWD was driver-selected with a pushbutton.

From 1985 to 1987, Ford offered the Sport GL, which included unique interior and exterior styling cues, the 2.3 L HSO engine, alloy wheels, tachometer, and the five-speed manual transaxle with a lower (numerically higher) final drive ratio of 3.73 for quicker acceleration. It was badged simply as &quot;GL&quot;, but was recognizable because it lacked the GL&#x27;s chrome front and rear bumpers, had 14&quot; alloy wheels and charcoal trim accents.

===Trim levels===
First generation Tempo trim levels:
* L (Entry level model)
* GL (Mid-range model. Also Sport GL)
* GLX (Luxury model. 1984 and 1985 model years only)
* LX (Luxury model. Introduced for 1986. Replaced the GLX)
* AWD (1987 model year only.)

First generation Topaz trim levels:
* L (Entry level model. 1984 model year only)
* GS (Mid-range model. Equivalent to Tempo GL)
* GS-AWD (1987 model year only)
* LS (Luxury model)
* LS-AWD (1987 model year only)
* XR5 (Sport model. 1987 model year only. Coupe only)

==Second generation (1988–1994)==

For 1988, the Tempo and Topaz sedans were redesigned, while the coupes were facelifted — in each case more resembling their Taurus and Sable counterparts. Both cars arrived in November 1987. The Tempo received a restyled grille with three thin horizontal chrome bars, composite flush-mounted rectangular headlamps and restyled front turn signals. The Tempo GLS, received a black grille and &quot;D&quot; pillar; flush mounted tail lamps and revised rear quarter window. The Topaz received a more formal, more vertical rear window, waterfall grille, more revised wheels, and solid red tail lamps. The HSO engine was standard equipment on the Mercury Topaz XR5 and LTS models.

Both the sedan and coupe received a revised instrument panels with a central gauge cluster that included a standard engine temperature gauge, and ergonomic driver controls. Fan and windshield wiper controls were mounted on rotary-style switches on either side of the instrument panel, and the HVAC controls received a new push-button control layout. Other changes included revised interior door panels. A driver&#x27;s side airbag continued as an option. LX and AWD models received chrome and wood trim on the dash and doors. Topaz models featured a tachometer-equipped gauge cluster and a front center armrest as standard.

For the 1991 model year the all-wheel drive Tempo and Topaz and the Canadian market exclusive entry-level Tempo L were discontinued. For 1992, the Tempo and Topaz were mildly restyled, with the Tempo gaining body-colored side trim that replaced the black and chrome trim, as well as full body-colored bumpers. The Tempo&#x27;s three bar chrome grille was replaced with a body-colored monochromatic piece, while the Topaz&#x27;s chrome grille was replaced with a non-functional light-bar.

Also for 1992, the 3.0 L Vulcan V6 engine from the Taurus and Sable was introduced as an option for the GL and LX models, and as the standard engine on the GLS. The 1992 model year was the last year of the GLS, as it and its Topaz counterpart were discontinued in 1993. This left the Tempo with only two trim level options, GL and LX. 1992 also brought a slightly redesigned gauge cluster, with a tachometer reading up to 7,000 rpm instead of the previous 6,000 rpm. A fuel door indicator was added to the fuel gauge as an arrow pointing to the side of the car where the fuel door was located. 1992 was the only year when a speedometer reading to 120 mph was available in American models, and only in the GLS, XR5 and LTS trim levels; all other model years read to 85 MPH.

A revised body with eight headlamps was previewed late in 1991, and a redesigned Tempo was expected for 1993 or 1998. The Tempo was discontinued in 1994, replaced by the Contour for model year 1995. 

===Trim levels===
Second generation Tempo trim levels:
*L (Entry level model. Discontinued in 1991)
*GL (Mid-range model)
*LX (Luxury model. Sedan only)
*AWD (Includes LX trim. Sedan only. Discontinued in 1991)
*GLS (Replaced Sport GL as the performance oriented model. Discontinued in 1992)

Second generation Topaz trim levels:
* GS (Mid-range model equivalent to the Tempo GL. Available from November 1987 to 1994)
* GS-AWD (Available from November 1987 to 1991)

==End of production==
Although a third-generation Tempo had been spotted testing in 1990, this was eventually scrapped in favor of replacing the car with an adapted version of the European Ford Mondeo, then late in development. By 1993 Ford had been losing money on the Tempo for a decade. While the Tempo had long been a loss leader for Ford, the incoming Contour was based on the Mondeo, one of the most expensive cars in Ford&#x27;s European lineup. Ford was unsuccessful in drawing a distinction between the Tempo and Contour, and many buyers assumed that the new car would be priced the same as the old, causing some to face a large sticker shock.

For buyers shopping for a compact Ford, moving to the Contour came with a jump in price: the range topping 1994 Tempo LX sedan with V6 cost about $12,900, , while a base model 1995 Contour GL with four-cylinder engine and manual transmission was $13,990, .

1994 marked the last year for the &quot;HSC&quot; engine, the 2.5 L having been dropped from the Taurus in 1991. It was also the end for the 3-speed FLC automatic transmission, with the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer using the Ford F-4EAT transmission.

The last Ford Tempo was built at Oakville Assembly on May 20, 1994. The facility was retooled to build the Ford Windstar. Kansas City Assembly and Cuautitlán Assembly became assembly points for the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique.

==Production figures==
The Tempo was a sales success for Ford, staying one of the top ten best selling cars in the US, if not one of the top five, during its entire production run. For the introductory, extended 1984 model year (16 months long), Ford sold a total of 531,468 examples of the Tempo and Topaz combined, but this was also the nameplate&#x27;s best year. All model year production figures for the Tempo are as follows:



==Other markets==
===China===
During the early 1990s, in an attempt to ease trade tensions with the United States, China agreed to buy millions of dollars worth of automobiles from each of the Big Three American automakers; the share of the deal for Ford was worth $32 million. Along with reducing Chinese dependence on imports of Japanese automobiles, the arrangement let China keep its favored nation status with the United States (despite political tensions of the late 1980s).

In 1992, Ford began sales operations in China for the first time, introducing the Tempo alongside the Ford Taurus, Ford Crown Victoria, Ford Aerostar, and the Lincoln Town Car. In total, the Chinese government purchased over 8,200 Tempos, with the initial order of 3010 1992 four-door Tempo sedans serving as the largest single fleet order ever received by Ford. In addition of the fitment of metric-unit instrument panels, the Tempo underwent several revisions for the Chinese market, including modifications of the fuel system to accommodate leaded fuel, heavier-duty suspension, and heavier-grade wiring.

The initial government fleet order was originally intended for use as taxis and tourist vehicles; all were white-colored GL-trim four-door sedans. Following their importation, the Tempos remained under government ownership under official use, later sold to private owners.

===Mexico===
Ford assembled and sold two models based on the American Tempo in Mexico — the Ford Topaz and the Ford Ghia.

The cars were built in Ford&#x27;s Cuautitlán Assembly plant. The lower level of automation at that plant translated into higher assembly costs, making a Mexican-built Ford Topaz retail for about US$400 more than a more well equipped US model with more effective pollution controls.

The first to hit the Mexican market was the Ford Topaz, debuting in 1984. This car was based on the American Tempo, and was offered in both two door and four door sedan versions. Like the US model, the Ford Topaz was restyled in 1988.

The Ford Ghia debuted in 1991. Based on the American Mercury Topaz, this model was more luxuriously trimmed, based on the American Topaz LS. With wood grain panel doors, power antena, and 5 band stereo graphic equalizer, alloy wheels 14&quot;, similar a BBS model used by European Ford Fiesta or Volkswagen Golf GTi. A 4 Cylinders 2.3 L only available. For 1992, A 3-speed automatic transmission and V6 engine were only available. Also, leather interior.

==T-Drive Tempo==
In or around 1990, a modified Tempo was used as a rolling testbed for a new powertrain configuration that Ford called &quot;T-Drive&quot;. This system used transverse inline engines with the drive for the transmission taken off the center of the crankshaft, rather than the end.

The test Tempo&#x27;s original transverse straight four engine and transaxle were replaced with a transversely mounted DOHC straight-eight engine and a center-mounted longitudinal transaxle, making the Tempo Rear Wheel Drive. The T-Drive specification allowed for engines of 4, 6, and 8 cylinders of 2.0 L, 3.2 L, and 4.0 L respectively, and the Tempo received the largest engine. Power output was estimated to have been in the range of . It is possible that the Tempo was chosen as it could accommodate a drive shaft and rear differential, due to the availability of the AWD model. This 8 cylinder, RWD Tempo with independent rear suspension was shown briefly and never seen again.

In 1991, the T-Drive technology was unveiled to the public as part of two concept cars; the Contour sedan and the Mystique minivan. It did not go into production.

<text>Richard Paul Bacon (born 30 November 1975) is an English television and radio presenter and producer. He has worked on television shows including &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, and on radio stations including Capital FM, Xfm London and BBC Radio Five Live. In 2016, Bacon became the presenter of The National Geographic Channel&#x27;s reboot of its documentary and panel discussion TV series, &quot;Explorer&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Bacon grew up in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and was educated at St Peter&#x27;s Church of England Primary School on Bellamy Road, followed by two private schools, also in Nottinghamshire: at Wellow House School, a preparatory school in the village of Wellow, and then at Worksop College, a boarding school in Worksop. He studied Business Studies with Electronics at Nottingham Trent University, but dropped out after a year.

==Life and career==
His first job in the media was as a reporter for BBC Radio Nottingham, notably on the programme &quot;The Beat&quot;. In February 1996, he joined L!VE TV as a reporter; this saw him being banned from the State Opening of Parliament, and having a beer thrown at him by Damon Albarn as he tried to interview him leaving a nightclub.

===&quot;Blue Peter&quot;===
Bacon&#x27;s television break was as a presenter on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, which he joined on 21 February 1997. He presented alongside Romana D&#x27;Annunzio, Katy Hill, Konnie Huq and Stuart Miles. On 19 October 1998, he was the programme&#x27;s first-ever presenter to have his contract terminated in mid-season, after the tabloid newspaper &quot;News of the World&quot; published a report of Bacon taking cocaine. His tenure on the programme lasted just over 18 months. The then head of BBC children&#x27;s programmes Lorraine Heggessey went on air to explain Bacon&#x27;s dismissal to CBBC viewers. Bacon was required to return his Blue Peter badge upon his dismissal.

On the 60th anniversary of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, former presenter Peter Purves presented Bacon with a Blue Peter badge.

===TV career since &quot;Blue Peter&quot;===
Bacon&#x27;s television career survived the setback, and he has since presented such shows as &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and reality TV shows &quot;Back To Reality&quot; and &quot;Castaway Exposed&quot;.

In August 2005, the band The Magic Numbers walked out of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, after Bacon made a remark that was widely thought to be about the body shape of members of the band; during rehearsals he referred to the band as a &quot;big, fat melting pot of talent&quot;.

Between 2006 and 2011, Bacon narrated the BBC Three series &quot;Most Annoying People&quot;.

Bacon guest-hosted ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; during 2005, Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; on several occasions during 2007 and 2008, and BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot; from 2008 to 2009. He was the narrator for series 1 to 3 of Sky&#x27;s police documentary &quot;Brit Cops&quot;.

In late 2010, he presented &quot;Richard Bacon&#x27;s Beer &amp; Pizza Club&quot; on ITV4. A second series aired in late 2011. Just before the 2010 World Cup he hosted a show called &quot;World Cup&#x27;s Most Shocking Moments&quot;, with Peter Crouch.

Bacon presented editions of BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;Young Voters&#x27; Question Time&quot;. He has made several TV cameo appearances as himself, including &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; in 2007 (in which his character hires escort girls to play Scrabble with him all night), the episode &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; of the TV series &quot;FM&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Thick of It&quot; (both in 2009) and an episode of &quot;Psychoville&quot; in 2011. In October 2011, he hosted BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;Up for Hire&quot;, an interactive series over the course of five nights tackling one of Britain&#x27;s biggest issues – youth unemployment. He also presented &quot;Brit Cops: Frontline Crime&quot; on Sky TV.

In April 2012, he presented the Channel 4 television series &quot;Hidden Talent&quot;, each programme of which featured ordinary members of the public taking tests in certain fields or skills to identify any previously unidentified talent.

On 13 January 2013, Bacon appeared on &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot; with his family playing against Louie Spence. On 25 November 2013, Bacon hosted one series of ITV&#x27;s game show &quot;Show Me the Telly&quot;. On 8 December 2013, he guest-presented an episode of &quot;Sunday Scoop&quot;.

On 17 February 2014, he hosted a one-off show, &quot;Benefits Britain: The Debate&quot;, for Channel 4. In the same year he presented the live Channel 4 programme &quot;How Rich Are You?&quot;, about the UK economy.

In 2015, Bacon co-presented the first series of &quot;The Big Painting Challenge&quot; alongside Una Stubbs for BBC One, and sports show &quot;Eternal Glory&quot; for ITV. He also joined Reena Ninan as a substitute co-host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Now&quot; overnight and &quot;America This Morning&quot; news programme.

In November 2016 Bacon became the presenter of the National Geographic Channel&#x27;s &quot;Explorer&quot; programme, which comprises several (usually three) short films, introduced by Bacon, involving matters of social, political, environmental or humanitarian significance. Each film is then discussed before a live studio audience with Bacon moderating, and usually includes the filmmaker or another representative of the film and at least one expert on either side of the issue. For the debut show, Bacon hiked through Yosemite National Park with President Barack Obama.

In June 2017, he began hosting a daily half-hour newsmagazine show called &quot;Top 30&quot;. It originally aired on Fox affiliates for four weeks before being picked up as a regular series, broadcast nationally across America in September 2017. On 13 September 2017, it was renewed through 2019.

In July 2019, he was a guest presenter filling in for Piers Morgan on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;.

In October 2019, the American TV network ABC commissioned his original &quot;whodunnit&quot; game show format &quot;The Hustler&quot; for an eight-part series, hosted by Craig Ferguson. Production began in the fall, with Bacon serving as one of its executive producers. It was cancelled in 2022. Richard Bacon has also produced &quot;This Is My House&quot; (2021–2022) and &quot;I Literally Just Told You&quot; (2021) presented by Jimmy Carr.

===Radio career===
Bacon joined BBC Radio 5 Live to present the late-night show on Saturdays and Sundays. After this, he worked as an announcer for BBC 7 and then a DJ for Capital FM followed by Xfm London.

He returned to 5 Live, and from November 2007 until December 2009 presented the late-night programme, in which his sign-off (&quot;Goodnight Great Britain, wherever you are&quot;) copied that of Jack Killian, the main character in the NBC television series &quot;Midnight Caller&quot;. He also on occasion stood in for Simon Mayo in the daytime film review programme, and stated that his favourite film is &quot;The Apartment&quot;.

In January 2010, Bacon became the regular presenter of the 5 Live mid-afternoon show from Mondays to Thursdays, in which he replaced the departing Simon Mayo. The show covered news, sport, celebrity interviews and special features. On Tuesdays there was a TV review with Boyd Hilton and another guest, looking back over the week&#x27;s television and previewing future programmes. In the Moan-In on Wednesdays, listeners could share their moans and receive marks out of 10 from Bacon and a guest, often Dave Vitty. On Thursdays the feature was Chart The Week, where two guests would discuss the week&#x27;s most talked-about news stories. At the same time, Bacon started to present a regular Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio 6 Music; he later left to concentrate on other commitments. He returned to 6 Music in January 2012 for six weeks to present a Saturday morning programme.

Bacon&#x27;s afternoon show attracted criticism for its content, which was classified by the BBC Trust as &quot;news&quot;. Rival broadcaster Talksport made a general complaint in 2010 to the BBC Trust, claiming the BBC Radio 5 Live station was not providing its mandatory 75% news output, &quot;with many items falling outside of the remit, such as &#x27;entertainment-based interviews&#x27; and listener-generated features.&quot; Talksport&#x27;s complaint &quot;particularly singl[ed] out Bacon&#x27;s two-hour weekday afternoon show for criticism&quot;, finding in a poll that only 20% of listeners considered Bacon&#x27;s show to comprise &quot;news&quot;. In their response, the BBC Trust rejected Talksport&#x27;s complaints, but admitted that a review was required to develop &quot;&#x27;a more nuanced method of monitoring the proportion of news output&#x27; on 5 Live compared to the current system, which counts the whole of Richard Bacon&#x27;s afternoon show as news&quot;.

In August 2011, Bacon recommended that his listeners should watch a YouTube video of comedian Doug Stanhope, in which he mocked Sarah Palin&#x27;s disabled son Trig. The Down&#x27;s Syndrome Association complained to the BBC about the broadcast, stating &quot;the association is shocked that a BBC employee has publicised the work of a comedian which is nothing more than a vile offensive rant.&quot; Both Bacon and the BBC apologised for the broadcast, with Bacon writing &quot;I full well understand my responsibilities as a broadcaster and such a reference fell below the standards I set myself personally in my broadcasting.&quot;

On 1 July 2014, it was announced that Bacon would be leaving BBC Radio 5 Live later in the year. Bacon&#x27;s last Radio 5 Live show was broadcast on 24 September 2014.

Bacon also has covered for Simon Mayo on his BBC Radio 2 &quot;Drivetime&quot; show, when Mayo was on holiday in August 2015, and more recently in April 2016.

Bacon covered for Ian Payne on his LBC afternoon shows on 6 and 7 July 2019.

==Personal life==
Bacon married Rebecca McFarlane in 2008. They live in Los Angeles, where Bacon works in U.S. television. They have two children. His father-in-law is John McFarlane, who served as chairman of Barclays from 2015 to 2019.

In October 2011, Bacon announced on his podcast that he had been contacted by the Metropolitan Police, who advised him that his phone had been hacked by the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.

On 28 March 2018, Bacon explained to Nicky Campbell in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live that at the age of 42 he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), about which he said &quot;I like having it a lot, it is who I am. It&#x27;s just learning to work with it and manage it means that life gets less chaotic and painful for my wife and children.&quot;

In July 2018, he was placed in an induced coma after becoming ill with pneumonia.

In October 2019, he discussed his alcohol addiction.

===Charity===
Bacon is a celebrity supporter of the British Red Cross and is particularly interested in their National Flood Appeal and international messaging services.

<text>In telecommunications, an area code overlay complex is a telephone numbering plan that assigns multiple area codes to the same geographic numbering plan area (NPA). Area code overlays are implemented in territories of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) to mitigate exhaustion of central office codes in growth areas. The method has been in use since 1992, and has been the exclusive method of area code relief since 2007.

==History==
From the inception of the North American Numbering Plan in 1947 until 1992, the only method of introducing new area codes was the area code split. It divided an existing numbering plan area (NPA) into multiple regions, one of which retained the existing area code. The other parts were assigned a new NPA code each. 

The retaining area was usually the historically more established or developed place, and required no numbering changes. It gained numbering capacity by acquiring the central office codes of the other areas, because those were delegated to a new area code in the process. The existing central office codes in the separated areas are maintained in the new numbering plan area, so that the only change for existing subscribers is the change of area code. Thus, only area code references, where present for long-distance calling, required updating in directories, letterheads, and business cards. Local, seven-digit dialing was unaffected by the area code change.

With the proliferation of electronic switching systems starting in the 1980s, it became possible to implement another method for expanding numbering plan resources, the area code &quot;overlay&quot;. In an overlay numbering plan, also called &quot;overlay complex&quot;, an additional area code is assigned to an existing numbering plan area, thereby avoiding the need for existing customers in the reassigned regions to change telephone numbers. The first use of that solution was in New York City in 1992, when area code 917 was overlaid to two numbering plan areas, Manhattan&#x27;s area code 212, and area code 718 in the outer boroughs.

==Methodology==
Most implementations of the overlay method have required ten-digit dialing, by including the area code, for all subscribers for all calling destinations, local or long-distance.

===Exceptions===
Near numbering plan area boundaries, special situations arose at times when established communities extended on both sides of the boundary. To preserve local community integrity, identity, and convenience, a party could dial an office prefix for a local call with only seven-digits, but the destination was technically located in the adjacent number plan area. If a subscriber called a distant office prefix with the same area code, the call would require the dialing prefix &quot;1&quot; before the seven- or ten-digit number.

A similar practice was implemented on a large scale in the metropolitan area of Washington, DC, and its suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. Most of the Washington region&#x27;s inner ring is a single local calling area, even though it is split between three area codes–the District&#x27;s area code 202, Maryland&#x27;s area code 301 and Northern Virginia&#x27;s area code 703. For most of the second half of the 20th century, it was possible to dial any number in the metro area with just seven digits. The entire area implemented a system of central office code protection in which no central office code was duplicated in the entire area. Each existing central office code was properly routed with each area code in the region so that each telephone number in the region could be dialed with any of the regional area codes, giving the appearance of an overlay plan. One side effect of this scheme was that if a number was in use in any portion of the Washington area, the corresponding number in Maryland or Virginia could only be used in an area considered a safe distance from the metro area, such as western Virginia or the Eastern Shore of Maryland. This system was ended in 1991 due to an impending number shortage on both sides of the Potomac River.

A similar method was employed in Canada&#x27;s capital, Ottawa. It shared the same calling area as Hull, its twin city in Quebec, even though Ottawa was in area code 613 and Hull was in area code 819. Until 2006, it was possible to place a call between Ottawa and Hull with only seven digits. That continued even after Hull was merged into the larger city of Gatineau in 2002. That was implemented in a way that the same number could not be duplicated anywhere in eastern Ontario or western Quebec, even in areas a safe distance from the Ottawa area. However, Canada&#x27;s inefficient number allocation system and the proliferation of cellphones brought 819 to the brink of exhaustion by the turn of the century. The only available numbers in 819 could have theoretically been used in the former Hull, but they could not be issued without ending seven-digit dialing between Ottawa and Hull. As was the case in Washington, the only way to free up numbers was to end seven-digit dialing in the area, which was done in 2006. The sole legacy of the old system is a &quot;dual dialability&quot; system for federal government numbers on both sides of the provincial border; all federal government offices on the Quebec side duplicated several exchanges worth of their counterparts on the Ontario side.

===Rapid growth===
Urban sprawl accelerated the rate of expansion of metropolitan areas, and multiple split plans have caused the geographical area of a given area code in those regions to shrink, except in countries that assign shorter area codes and longer local numbers in areas with high population densities. The rapid growth in popularity of electronic devices (pagers and then mobile phones), in addition to regular landline growth, increased demand for new phone numbers even more. Although landline growth has sharply dropped and even decreased, largely by the elimination of residential landlines in favor of personal mobile phones, it has been replaced by the even worse problem of data-only devices (hotspots, modems, netbooks, and especially popular tablets), which still require a telephone number for use on cellular networks even if they are unable to make or receive regular calls.

The rise in popularity of mobile devices has added to the pressure against split plans, as an area-code change affecting the exchange in which a cellphone is based not only forces customers to reprogram their phones but also requires the wireless carrier to reassign the number of every device based in those areas. While phones with a SIM card have their own mobile device number updated automatically, there is still the inconvenience of users having to update their contact lists for local family members or others who have had their numbers changed too.

===Compromise===
Most overlay plans introduced the inconvenience of mandatory ten-digit dialing in which the area code must always be included even for local calls. Ten-digit dialing is not a technically necessary requirement, and 917 was initially deployed without it, but a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate instituted it at the demand of major telephone companies, to whom an overlay is considered a disadvantage to competitors. In Canada, ten-digit dialing is also a requirement of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in overlay area codes.

==Popularity==
Overlays were initially met with resistance, as they result in multiple area codes in the same geographic area, which requires ten-digit dialing. In many cases, such as 847 in Chicago&#x27;s northwestern suburbs and 212 in New York City, an overlay was an additional disruption to a community that had already been subject to one or multiple code splits, encountering pushback from state regulators or consumer groups. However, overlay plans were eventually used much more widely in some areas than others. For example, much of Ohio has large overlay complexes, as has northern Georgia and the North Carolina Piedmont. Connecticut, Illinois, Oregon, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and, more recently, California have also implemented many overlays. No area code splits have been performed since 2007, when area code 575 split off 505 in New Mexico, and no splits are proposed.

Telecommunications companies have increasingly favored overlays even in sparsely-populated rural areas in which ten-digit local numbers are unnecessary, as split plans force cellular providers to reprogram millions of client handsets. Customers also incur costs to publish new letterheads and to reprogram stored address book data on individual devices. Overlays have become more expedient as the proliferation of cell phones has accelerated area codes exhaustion. In most relief planning projects, overlays have become the sole option considered in the planning stage.

This is especially practiced for area codes that have been pushed back to the brink of exhaustion after being recently split, as carriers want to minimize additional customer inconveniences. For example, Maryland had been served solely by area code 301 from the implementation of the area code system until 1990, when everything from Baltimore eastward was split off as area code 410. Within only five years, 410 was already on the brink of exhaustion due to Baltimore&#x27;s rapid growth and the proliferation of cell phones, pagers, fax machines and dial-up Internet lines. However, the area&#x27;s dominant telephone provider, Bell Atlantic (now part of Verizon) realized that a split would have forced residents of either Baltimore or the Eastern Shore to change their numbers for the second time in the 1990s. Accordingly, area code 443 was created as an overlay for all of the eastern portion of Maryland in 1996.

Overlay plans also favor incumbent wireline carriers over new entrants, as the established firm already has large allocations of numbers in the more desirable existing code, and subscribers of new or growing competing carriers are relegated to unfamiliar, new codes.

The first example of an area code overlaid on an entire U.S. jurisdiction was Puerto Rico, with area code 939 added to the numbering plan area of area code 787, in 2001. Puerto Rico had just been split from area code 809, the area code for much of the Caribbean, in 1996. A split was deemed unfeasible due to the island&#x27;s extremely dense population and the lack of a suitable boundary for a split. Additionally, a split would have forced half of Puerto Ricans to change telephone numbers for the second time in a decade.

The first instance of a &quot;statewide&quot; overlay was West Virginia&#x27;s area code 304, in 2009. West Virginia had been served by 304 since the inception of the North American Numbering Plan, but it was obvious by 2007 that the state needed a new area code. At first, state officials voted to split off northern West Virginia with area code 681 and to leave southern West Virginia in 304. However, lobbying by the telecommunications industry led the state to reverse the decision and turn 681 into an overlay. Idaho followed that precedent in 2017 by overlaying area code 208 with 986.

The area codes for four of the five largest Canadian markets (416 in Toronto, 514 in Montreal, 604 in Vancouver, and 403 in Calgary) were split in the 1990s. Overlays gained popularity in the Canadian telephone network in the early 2000s. The proliferation of cellphones, fax machines, pagers, and dial-up Internet connections, particularly in larger markets threatened central office code exhaustion in many areas.

Particularly severe allocation problems manifested themselves at the turn of the century in Metro Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe, the center of Canada&#x27;s largest local calling area. This area had been served by 416 since the institution of the area code system. Despite the Golden Horseshoe&#x27;s explosive growth in the second half of the 20th century, numbers in the region were used up fairly quickly. As a result, the number allocation problem was not as severe in 416 as it was in the rest of Canada. Nevertheless, it was severe enough to force Toronto&#x27;s suburban ring into area code 905 in 1993. While the Golden Horseshoe would have likely needed another area code due to its continued growth, it is very likely that the immediate need for relief would have been staved off had it been possible to reallocate numbers from the smaller rate centers in the region to Metro Toronto. Within two years of the 905 split, 416 was back on the verge of exhaustion. American cities such as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles had been split between two area codes, but that solution was quickly ruled out for Metro Toronto because of the area&#x27;s extremely dense population and the lack of a suitable boundary for a split. It was ultimately decided to overlay 416 with area code 647 in 2001, two years after Metro Toronto was merged into the &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto.

The successful implementation of 647 triggered the rapid adoption of overlays across Canada. By 2023, seven-digit dialing had been effectively eliminated nationwide in Canada (as well as in most of the United States), due to both overlays and other regulatory requirements. Overlays are now the preferred method of expansion in Canada, and no numbering plan areas have been split in the country since 1999.

British Columbia and the Prairie Provinces have followed Puerto Rico and West Virginia&#x27;s lead with province-wide overlays. In those cases, a factor behind the decision was the desire to spare rural areas the expense and burden of changing their numbers.

==Types==
The North American Numbering Plan Administrator recognizes several types of overlays:

In a &quot;distributed overlay&quot;, or &quot;all-services overlay&quot;, an entire existing numbering plan area (NPA) gains another area code serving the entire area. Most area code overlays are of this kind.

In a &quot;single concentrated overlay&quot;, only the high-growth portion of an existing area gains a second area code. This was previously implemented in several numbering plan areas, but all of them have since covered entire NPAs.

In a &quot;multiple concentrated overlay&quot;, the entire existing numbering plan area gains multiple additional area codes, each of which serves a different subsection of the original. This has never been implemented.

In a &quot;multiple-area distributed overlay&quot;, two or more numbering plan areas gain a single new area code covering the entire area, either concurrently or in phases. Examples include 872 in Chicago, Illinois (over 312 and 773) as well as 587 and 825 in Alberta (over 403 and 780). In a phased example, area code 564 was implemented initially only on area code 360 in 2017, but will expand to three other codes when needed, in western Washington.

A &quot;boundary-extension overlay&quot; is a type in which one or more neighboring numbering plan areas (with an overlay code or a primary area code) is expanded. Examples include 321 over 407 in central Florida and 778 over 250 in British Columbia. In 1999, 281 was the first of this type, merging with 713 in Houston. Later that year, 972 merged with 214, followed by 323 merging with 213 in Los Angeles in 2017, and 858, in San Diego, with 619 a year later. In 2023, the first multiple boundary-extension overlay was implemented with the folding of area codes 602, 480, and 623 into a single overlay complex for the Phoenix metropolitan area.

&quot;Service-specific overlays&quot; are not practiced in the NANP. Only one case, the first overlay area code in the NANPA, 917, was an example of this. It was established originally as an area code specifically for cellphones and pagers in New York City, but soon afterward, the FCC specified that area codes must not be service-specific, but it grandfathered this use for 917. Later, 917 became available for landline assignments in New York City.

==Number pool management==
The persistent unpopularity of new area code creation by splits or overlays has contributed to a change in the rules of number block allocation to conserve the pool of available telephone numbers. The change, which allowed for the assignment of smaller number blocks, is commonly known as telephone number pooling, and has slowed the need for new area codes. For example, the western half of Washington, including Seattle, narrowly avoided the need for an overlay in 2001. Area code 564, originally planned for introduction in October 2001, was delayed indefinitely in August 2001 after state regulators determined that the use of number pooling had resulted in more efficiency in the use of telephone numbers in western Washington. The 564 overlay complex was delayed until 2017.

Number pooling is not practiced in Canada. Every competing carrier is issued blocks of 10,000 numbers for every rate center in which it offers service, regardless of its actual subscriber count. Individual rate centers exist even in the smallest hamlets, and even tiny unincorporated villages receive multiple blocks of 10,000 numbers. Larger cities, particularly &quot;megacities&quot; that were created by amalgamations in the 1990s and early 2000s, have multiple rate centers, which were not combined for years, if at all. For example, Mississauga, Canada&#x27;s sixth-largest city, is split between five rate centers even though it has been a single municipality since 1974. Hamilton, the nation&#x27;s tenth-largest city, is split between nine rate centers. Surrey, the nation&#x27;s twelfth-largest city, is split between three rate centers and part of a fourth, while Ottawa is split between 11. Overlays became the preferred relief solution in Canada, partly because it is not possible to reassign a number from a smaller rate center to a larger one, even if the smaller rate center has enough numbers to serve it. By 2013, as mentioned above, seven-digit dialling had been eliminated in all eight of Canada&#x27;s original numbering plan areas.

<text>David Whyte Macdonald is a Scottish zoologist and conservationist. He is the Director of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) at the University of Oxford, which he founded in 1986. He holds a Senior Research Fellowship at Lady Margaret Hall with the Title of Distinction of Professor of Wildlife Conservation. He has been an active wildlife conservationist since graduating from Oxford.

==Career==
David Macdonald&#x27;s concept was, and remains, to undertake original research on aspects of fundamental biology relevant to solving practical problems of wildlife conservation and environmental management, and thus to underpin policy formation and public debate of the many issues that surround the conservation of wildlife and its habitats. From his early work on red foxes he retains a specialisation in carnivores, with an increasing emphasis on felids. He has published over 300 papers in refereed international journals, and written or edited more than a dozen books, of which the most recent is &quot;Key Topics in Conservation Biology&quot;.

Amongst other things he is currently a visiting professor at Imperial College, chair of the Darwin Advisory Committee, Chair of Natural England&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee and board member, a Trustee of Earthwatch Europe and WWF-UK, and council member of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.

He has done much to popularise biology with the general public. He is known for his documentary films and his popular books, for which he has twice won the Natural World Author of the Year award. His &quot;Night of the Fox&quot; won the BAFTA for Best Documentary Film of 1976, &quot;Running with the Fox&quot; won the Natural History Book of the Year award for 1987, and &quot;Meerkats United&quot; won the Wildscreen 1988 award. His films include the popular BBC seven-part series &quot;The Velvet Claw&quot;, a natural history of carnivores.

==Awards and honours==
He won the Dawkins Prize for Conservation and Animal Welfare in 2005, he was awarded the American Society of Mammalogists&#x27; Merriam Prize for research in mammalogy in 2006, and in 2007 The Mammal Society of Great Britain&#x27;s equivalent medal. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 2008.

Macdonald was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.

<text>Bothenhampton is a village in the civil parish of Bridport, in southwest Dorset, England, just outside the town of Bridport. It is separated from the town only by the River Asker and the A35 Bridport by-pass. In the 2011 census the civil parish—which includes the settlement of Walditch—had a population of 2,131.

The parish church, Holy Trinity, was designed by the Arts and Crafts movement architect Edward Schroeder Prior in 1889. It was his first church. By the late 19th century the 15th century Old Holy Trinity Church had fallen into disrepair. There are 2 Commonwealth War Graves in the old churchyard. The new church was funded by J. P. F. Gundry, one of the directors of the West Bay Building Company, by public subscription and anonymous donation. The roof is the most radical feature of the church. The arches spring at 2’6 above floor level and rise to a ridge 30’ high. The windows are filled with a forerunner of Prior&#x27;s Early English glass. The altar table and furnishings were designed by another leading Arts and Crafts Movement architect, William Lethaby, as was the altar front with its intertwined wild roses, leaves and stems.

At the end of the village is the village park, which is a memorial to John Holt. Annual events, such as a barn dance organised by the Bothenhampton village hall committee, take place in the John Holt play area.

In 1801 the population was 334 and in 1901 this was still only 423. New houses were built between the 1st and 2nd world wars and there was a lot of building in the 1960s. By 1980 the population had grown to approx 1200 and by 2001 it had become 2186. By 2001 11% of Bothenhampton&#x27;s population were aged under 16, 42% were aged between 16 and 59 and 47% were aged 60 and over.

The civil parish and parish council were abolished with effect from 1 April 2024, with the parish area taken into Bridport.

<text>Progress Software Corporation is an American public company that produces software for creating and deploying business applications. Founded in Burlington, Massachusetts with offices in 16 countries, the company posted revenues of $531.3 million (USD) in 2021 and employs approximately 2100 people.

== History ==
=== 1980s: DLC to Progress Software ===
Progress Software was co-founded by several MIT graduates, including Joseph W. Alsop, Clyde Kessel, and Chip Ziering in 1981. Originally called Data Language Corporation (DLC), the company changed its name to Progress Software in 1987, the same name of its main product, Progress.

=== 1990s: Public company ===
In 1991, Progress Software joined the NASDAQ.

=== 2000s: Broad expansion ===
In 2002, Progress Software acquired Stylus Studio developer eXcelon Corporation for approximately $24 million. In 2003, Progress Software acquired DataDirect Technologies for $88 million. In 2004, Progress Software acquired Persistence Software for $16 million. In 2005, Progress acquired complex event processing company Apama. In January 2006, Progress Software acquired Actional Corporation. In 2006, Progress Software acquired Neon Systems, a company specializing in modernizing 3270 applications. 

In 2008, Progress Software acquired Xcalia, a data integration company, and Mindreef, which developed SOAPscope products. In September 2008, Progress acquired IONA Technologies, developer of service-oriented architecture platforms Artix and Orbix, for $146 million.

=== 2010s: Focusing and rebranding ===
In 2010, Progress Software acquired business process management vendor Savvion Inc. In April 2011, Progress Software sold their SWIFT integration product &quot;ADS&quot; (formally Iona&#x27;s &quot;Artix Data Services&quot;) to C24 Technologies Ltd. The product was re-branded to its former name &quot;Integration Objects&quot;.

In 2012, Progress announced its shift to become a much more narrowly focused specialist vendor, looking to sell or decommission most of their existing products. In June 2012, the company sold its open source division FuseSource, which was spun out from the IONA business in October 2010, to Red Hat. In October 2012, Progress Software sold the brands Sonic, Savvion, Actional and DataXtend (DXSI) to Trilogy which created the company Aurea Software. In December 2012, the Orbix, Orbacus and Artix product lines were sold to Micro Focus International for $15 million.

In 2013, Progress Software acquired Rollbase Inc. and Software AG acquired Apama activities from Progress Software. In 2014, Progress acquired Cincinnati-based Modulus. Also in 2014, Progress acquired Telerik, a provider of application development tools. In 2019, Progress Software acquired Ipswitch, Inc., an IT management vendor known for its MOVEit managed file transfer platform.

In May 2016, Progress Software re-branded as &quot;Progress&quot; in an effort to &quot;shed any doubts it was not living up to its name&quot;.

=== 2020s: Targeted expansion ===
In 2020, Progress Software announced the acquisition of Chef Software Inc., the developers of the Chef configuration management tool. The acquisition was completed by October 2020. In 2021, Progress Software acquired Kemp Technologies, who build load balancing products. The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2021. In 2023, Progress Software acquired database vendor MarkLogic Corporation. In 2024, Progress Software acquired ShareFile from Cloud Software. The acquisition was completed on October 31, 2024.

== Data breaches ==
In 2023, a security vulnerability in Progress-owned file transfer software MOVEit was exploited in a data breach affecting various companies and government organizations. A running total maintained by cybersecurity company Emsisoft showed that more than 2,500 organizations were known to have been impacted as of October 25, 2023 with more than 80 percent of those organizations being US-based. The cybercriminal organization Clop was alleged to have been partially responsible for the attacks, and claimed responsibility for breaches of 1st Source, the BBC, British Airways, the New York City Department of Education, Putnam Investments, and Shell among others.

At Harvard University, Pipes taught large courses on Imperial Russia as well as the Russian Revolution and guided over 80 graduate students to their PhDs. In 1976, he headed Team B, a team of analysts organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who analyzed the strategic capacities and goals of the Soviet military and political leadership. Pipes is the father of American historian Daniel Pipes.

==Early life==
Richard Pipes was born in Cieszyn, Poland to an assimilated Jewish family (whose name had originally been spelled &quot;Piepes&quot; in German spelling, which in pronunciation is the same as the Polish spelling &quot;Pipes&quot; His father was a businessman and a Polish legionnaire during World War I. He was a co-owner of the chocolate factory Dea in Cieszyn, before he moved to Warsaw in 1929. During the time Pipes attended the in Michejda Street. By Pipes&#x27;s own account, during his childhood and youth, he never thought about the Soviet Union; the major cultural influences on him were Polish and German. When he was age 16, Pipes saw Adolf Hitler at Marszałkowska Street in Warsaw during Hitler&#x27;s victory tour after the Invasion of Poland. The Pipes family fled occupied Poland in October 1939 and arrived in the United States in July 1940, after seven months passing through Italy. Pipes became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1943 while serving in the United States Army Air Corps. He was educated at Muskingum College, Cornell University, and Harvard University. In October 1944, Pipes was sent to Camp Ritchie, Maryland, to receive training in psychological warfare.

==Career==
Pipes taught at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1996. He was the director of Harvard&#x27;s Russian Research Center from 1968 to 1973 and later Baird Professor Emeritus of History at Harvard University. In 1962 he delivered a series of lectures on Russian intellectual history at Leningrad State University. He acted as senior consultant at the Stanford Research Institute from 1973 to 1978. During the 1970s, he was an advisor to Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson. In 1981 and 1982 he served as a member of the National Security Council, holding the post of Director of East European and Soviet Affairs under President Ronald Reagan. He also became head of the Nationalities Working Group. Pipes was a member of the Committee on the Present Danger from 1977 until 1992 and belonged to the Council of Foreign Relations. He also attended two Bilderberg Meetings, at both of which he lectured. In the 1970s, Pipes was a leading critic of détente, which he described as &quot;inspired by intellectual indolence and based on ignorance of one&#x27;s antagonist and therefore inherently inept&quot;.

===Team B===
Pipes was head of the 1976 Team B, composed of civilian experts and retired military officers and agreed to by then-CIA director George H. W. Bush at the urging of the president&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) as a competitive analysis exercise. Team B was created at the instigation of then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as an antagonist force to a group of CIA intelligence officials known as Team A. His hope was that it would produce a much more aggressive assessment of Soviet Union military capabilities. Unsurprisingly, it argued that the National Intelligence Estimate on the Soviet Union, generated yearly by the CIA, underestimated both Soviet military strategy and ambition and misinterpreted Soviet strategic intentions.

Team B faced criticism. The international relations journalist Fred Kaplan writes that Team B &quot;turns out to have been wrong on nearly every point.&quot; Pipes&#x27;s group insisted that the Soviet Union, as of 1976, maintained &quot;a large and expanding Gross National Product,&quot; and argued that the CIA belief that economic chaos hindered the USSR&#x27;s defenses was a ruse on the part of the USSR. One CIA employee called Team B &quot;a kangaroo court&quot;.

Pipes called Team B&#x27;s evidence &quot;soft.&quot; Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed several new weapons, featuring a nuclear-armed submarine fleet that used a system that did not depend on active sonar, and was thus undetectable by existing technology.

According to Pipes, &quot;Team B was appointed to look at the evidence and to see if we could conclude that the actual Soviet strategy is different from ours, i.e. the strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). It has now been demonstrated totally that it was&quot;. In 1986, Pipes maintained that Team B contributed to creating more realistic defense estimates.

In what was meant to be an &quot;off-the-record&quot; interview, Pipes told Reuters in March 1981 that &quot;Soviet leaders would have to choose between peacefully changing their Communist system in the direction followed by the West or going to war. There is no other alternative and it could go either wayDétente is dead.&quot; Pipes also stated in the interview that Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany was susceptible to pressure from the Russians. It was learned independently that Pipes was the official who spoke to Reuters. This potentially jeopardized Pipes&#x27; job. The White House and the &quot;incensed&quot; State Department issued statements repudiating Pipes&#x27; comments.

===Writings on Russian history===
Pipes wrote many books on Russian history, including &quot;Russia under the Old Regime&quot; (1974), &quot;The Russian Revolution&quot; (1990), and &quot;Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime&quot; (1994), and was a frequent interviewee in the press on the matters of Soviet history and foreign affairs. His writings also appear in &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. At Harvard, he taught large courses on Imperial Russia as well as the Russian Revolution and guided over 80 graduate students to their PhDs.

Pipes was the leading expert on philosopher Peter Struve.

Pipes is known for arguing that the origins of the Soviet Union can be traced to the separate path taken by 15th-century Muscovy, in a Russian version of the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; thesis. In Pipes&#x27; opinion, Muscovy differed from every other State in Europe in that it had no concept of private property, and that everything was regarded as the property of the Grand Duke/Tsar. In Pipes&#x27; view, this separate path undertaken by Russia (possibly under Mongol influence) ensured that Russia would be an autocratic state with values fundamentally dissimilar from those of Western civilization. Pipes argued that this &quot;patrimonialism&quot; of Imperial Russia started to break down when Russian leaders attempted to modernize in the 19th century, without seeking to change the basic &quot;patrimonial&quot; structure of Russian society. In Pipes&#x27;s opinion, this separate course undertaken by Russia over the centuries made Russia uniquely open to revolution in 1917. Pipes strongly criticized the values of the radical &quot;intelligentsia&quot; of late Imperial Russia for what he sees as their fanaticism and inability to accept reality. Pipes stressed that the Soviet Union was an expansionist, totalitarian state bent on world conquest. He is also known for the thesis that, contrary to many traditional histories of the Soviet Union at the time, the October Revolution was, rather than a popular general uprising, a coup under false slogans foisted upon the majority of the Russians by a tiny segment of the population driven by a select group of radical intellectuals, who subsequently established a one-party dictatorship that was intolerant and repressive from the start.

In 1992, Pipes served as an expert witness in the Constitutional Court of Russia&#x27;s trial of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

==Reception==
His writing has provoked discussions in the academic community, for example in &quot;The Russian Review&quot; among several others. Among members of this school, Lynne Viola and Sheila Fitzpatrick write that Pipes focused too narrowly on intellectuals as causal agents. Peter Kenez, a former PhD student of Pipes&#x27;, argued that Pipes approached Soviet History as a prosecutor, intent solely on proving the criminal intent of the defendant, to the exclusion of anything else, and described Pipes as a researcher of &quot;great reputation&quot; but with passionate anti-communist views.

Other critics have written that Pipes wrote at length about what Pipes described as Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s unspoken assumptions and conclusions while neglecting what Lenin actually said. Alexander Rabinowitch writes that whenever a document can serve Pipes&#x27; long-standing crusade to demonize Lenin, Pipes commented on it at length; if the document allows Lenin to be seen in a less negative light, Pipes passed over it without comment. Pipes&#x27; critics argued that his historical writings perpetuated the Soviet Union as &quot;evil empire&quot; narrative in an attempt &quot;to put the clock back a few decades to the times when Cold War demonology was the norm.&quot; Diane P. Koenker described &quot;The Russian Revolution&quot; as having a &quot;fundamentally reactionary&quot; perspective that presents a sympathetic view of imperial forces and depicted Lenin as a &quot;single-minded, ruthless and cowardly intellectual&quot;.

Following the demise of the USSR, Pipes charged the revisionists with skewing their research, by means of statistics, to support their preconceived ideological interpretation of events, which made the results of their research &quot;as unreadable as they were irrelevant for the understanding of the subject,&quot; to provide intellectual cover for Soviet terror and acting as simpletons and/or communist dupes. He also stated that their attempt at &quot;history from below&quot; only obfuscated the fact that &quot;Soviet citizens were the helpless victims of a totalitarian regime driven primarily by a lust for power.&quot;

==Honors==
Pipes had an extensive list of honors, including: Honorary Consul of the Republic of Georgia, Foreign Member of the Polish Academy of Learning (PAU), Commander&#x27;s Cross of Merit of the Republic of Poland, Honorary DHL at Adelphi College, Honorary LLD at Muskingum College, Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Silesia, Szczecin University, and the University of Warsaw. Honorary Doctor of Political Science from the Tbilisi (Georgia) School of Political Studies. Annual Spring Lecturer of the Norwegian Nobel Peace Institute, Walter Channing Cabot Fellow of Harvard University, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Guggenheim Fellow (twice), Fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies and recipient of the George Louis Beer Prize of the American Historical Association. He was a member of the Board of Advisors of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. He served on a number of editorial boards including that of the International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence. He received one of the 2007 National Humanities Medals and in 2009 he was awarded both the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and the Brigham–Kanner Property Rights Prize by the William &amp; Mary Law School.
In 2010, Pipes received the medal &quot;Bene Merito&quot; awarded by the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs. From 2010 to 2014, he participated in the annual Valdai Discussion Club.

He was a member of the advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

==Personal life==
Pipes married Irene Eugenia Roth in 1946; the couple had two children, Daniel and Steven. Their son Daniel Pipes is a scholar of Middle Eastern affairs.

Pipes died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on May 17, 2018, at the age of 94.

<text>Bourton is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated north of the A303 road on the border with Somerset and Wiltshire between Mere and Wincanton. The parish is the most northerly in Dorset and in the 2011 census had a population of 822. &quot;Bourton&quot; is the most populous village in the electoral ward called Bourton and District. The District extends to Silton then south to Buckhorn Weston and Kington Magna. The total ward population at the abovementioned census was 1,905. The village lies on the River Stour which passes through the historic Bourton Mill, once home to the second largest water wheel in Britain ( in diameter) .

The village has two stores, a petrol station and a public house. The White Lion Inn stands on the High Street, which leads off what was the old main London to Exeter road before the village was bypassed to the south in 1992 by the A303. St George&#x27;s Church, which stands on one of the highest points in the village, was built via public subscription in 1810 and borders the primary school of the same name.

The point at which the counties of Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire meet beside the lake at the rear of Bourton Mill is marked by Egbert&#x27;s Stone which once fell into the River Stour, but was rescued and re-erected. In 878 it formed the rallying point for Alfred the Great&#x27;s troops before the Battle of Ethandun. His grandfather, Egbert of Wessex, was said to have placed the stone there to settle the shire boundaries. Just over the county border is King Alfred&#x27;s Tower.

The mill, which is mentioned in the Domesday Book, has had many incarnations. As a linen mill it processed flax and supplied canvas to the Royal Navy but when industry declined it was developed into a foundry with a blast furnace and was one of the first places to make the new threshing machines in the West of England. It went on to build boilers, steam lorries and gas engines as well as gaining a reputation as a builder of water wheels. During the First World War Mills Bombs were produced here in vast quantities. After the Gasper dam burst upriver in the summer of 1917, much of the machinery was washed from the factory and it took a number of years for industry to restart on the site. When it did return in 1933 the factory entered its final phase as a dried milk processing plant and this continued up until its closure in 1998. It has now been demolished to make way for the Mill Lake development.

Chaffeymoor House, located in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty at Chaffeymoor, is a large 17th-century house. It is a Grade II listed building. Its gardens are open to the public.

The nearest railway station is in neighbouring Gillingham. Trains run on the Exeter to Waterloo line.

<doc id="1071415" wikidata="Q7699109" url="?curid=1071415" title="Ten-digit dialing">
<text>Ten-digit dialing is a telephone dialing procedure in the countries and territories of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). It is the practice of including the area code of a telephone number when dialing to initiate a telephone call. When necessary, the ten-digit number may be prefixed with the trunk code &quot;1&quot;, which is referred to as &quot;1+10-digit dialing&quot; or &quot;national format&quot;.

==History==
The implementation and expansion of the North American Numbering Plan between 1947 and 1992 preserved a long-standing practice in the United States and Canada that callers should only need to dial the local seven-digit telephone number when placing a call within the caller&#x27;s exchange area or within the home numbering plan area (NPA). In seven-digit dialing, callers dial the three-digit central office code and the four-digit station number of the destination telephone if it resides in the same numbering plan area. Dialing of an area code before the telephone number, referred to as ten-digit dialing, was only necessary for &quot;foreign NPA&quot; (FNPA) calls.

Some communities with significant parts on both sides of an area code boundary implemented central office code protection, where possible, to ensure the same seven-digit local number was not assigned in two different area codes in the same city to assure seven-digit dialing in the entire community.

==Code exhaustion relief==
When the demand for telecommunication services in a numbering plan area threatens to exceed the capacity of telephone numbers of a single area code, the local public service agency and the Federal Communications Commission initiate relief measures to mitigate the exhaustion, and assure continued service with minimal customer impact in the affected areas.

===Area code split===
In an area code split, the established practice of relief from 1947 to 1992, the affected numbering plan area is divided into suitable parts, most often two, and assigned a new area code to one of the areas, while maintaining the existing area code in the other. The area that retained the code was most commonly the denser-populated or geographically or historically more significant part. This freed the telephone numbers already issued in the new area for use in the existing, now smaller, numbering plan area. This practice preserved seven-digit dialing in all affected areas.

===Area code overlay===
By 1992, a new method of relief became available from the proliferation of electronic switching systems that were based on stored program control (SPC), which reduced the need for electromechanical extensions of the switching fabric. This made it possible to assign multiple area codes to a single numbering plan area. An area code overlay required additional technology in all affected switching systems to recognize the local area codes and select the appropriate routing for local calls, even within the wire center. This eliminated the possibility of maintaining seven-digit dialing, and required the dialing of ten digits for all calls.

Consumer groups and some state regulators, such as the Illinois Commerce Commission and Citizens Utility Board for northwest Chicago, and the NYS Public Service Commission in NYC, opposed the requirement with attempts at litigation.
The added effort in remembering and dialing longer numbers was perceived as a disadvantage of overlay plans, which were introduced to reduce the inconveniences associated with the traditional method of splitting an area. However, overlays have become the primary relief method and ten-digit dialing has become increasingly common in the U.S. and Canada.

==1+10 dialing==
Long-distance calls within a numbering plan area may also require dialing of an extra leading digit, designated as &quot;1+10D&quot;. This became standard in all of North America by beginning of 1995 to allow introduction of [[interchangeable NPA codes], which are area codes that did not have a 0 or 1 as the middle digit and could therefore be confused with the central office code.

Dialing &quot;1&quot; before the area code is most often required only for long-distance calls. Some telephone systems in early overlay areas do not accept a &quot;1&quot; before the area code for local calls; all Canadian landlines follow this pattern. However, in metropolitan [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], as well as the entire state of [[California]], the initial &quot;1&quot; is required even for local calls for landline phones located within an overlay complex or with a single NPA that also serves customers with a 988 NXX (see below). All cellphones in North America ignore this and only require the user to dial ten digits.

==Ten-digit dialing in non-overlay areas==
A few area codes not part of any overlay complex nonetheless require ten-digit dialing if part of the local calling area is within an overlay complex. For example, the [[Fort Knox]] [[United States Army|Army]] base in [[Kentucky]] is served by [[area code 502]], but its local calling area includes cities that are served by the [[Area codes 270 and 364|270/364 overlay complex]]. As a result, Fort Knox imposed ten-digit dialing for all off-base numbers when the 270/364 overlay was established in 2014.

A July 2020 order by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] required ten-digit dialing of telephone numbers with area codes in the United States that were not overlaid, but had an assignment of the central office prefix &quot;988&quot;, conflicting with its designation for the [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]] by federal law.

NANPA Planning Letter 544 cites 83 area codes affected in 37 states. Three additional area codes were already transitioning to ten-digit dialing as the result of overlay implementations. Central office code 988 was in the process of discontinuation for [[area code 904]]. While included in the list of 83 area codes, [[area code 701]] in North Dakota will not be converted to ten-digit dialing because the 32 telephone numbers in the 988 central office were reassigned to another prefix. Several of these codes have subsequently been converted to overlay complexes and the implementation of such complexes could be expedited as the transition to ten-digit dialing was not necessary.

As part of Canada&#x27;s implementation of a national 9-8-8 hotline, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) announced in August 2022 that all remaining Canadian non-overlay areas with seven-digit dialing, most of which use &quot;988&quot; as a central office code under their respective area codes, were required to convert to ten-digit dialing by May 31, 2023. A partial exception was granted for the three northern territories served by [[area code 867]], which was not projected to exhaust until at least 2043; only the [[Yellowknife]] area (which contains the 988 exchange) was required to convert, with seven-digit dialing remaining optional elsewhere in the region due in part to unique geographical and cultural considerations.

<text>Bradford Abbas is a village and civil parish in north-west Dorset, England, on the border with Somerset. The village is south-east of Yeovil and south-west of Sherborne. The parish includes the small settlement of Saxon Maybank to the north, and had a population of 975 at the 2011 Census.

The name of the village signifies the &quot;Abbot&#x27;s broad ford&quot; on the River Ivel, the abbot in question being that of Sherborne; the land was given to Sherborne Abbey by King Alfred the Great.

In the dry summer of 2010 cropmarks in sun-parched fields of barley, visible from the air, revealed the existence of a previously unsuspected 1st-century temporary Roman camp, one of only four detected in southwest Britain. In the 19th century five Roman kilns were found in a field to the east of the village. Also found at the site were pottery, roof slates, bracelets and querns.

== Parish Church of St Mary ==
The oldest part of the church is the chancel, dating from the 12th century, though the main construction of the church is 15th century and was started by William Bradford, Abbot of Sherborne. 

The tower has many niches on its west face, two containing finely carved original figures. The stone rood screen dates from the 15th century, and some of the steps leading to the rood loft are still extant.

<text>Bradford Peverell is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset, north-west of the county town Dorchester. It is sited by the south bank of the River Frome, among low chalk hills on the dip slope of the Dorset Downs. The A37 road between Dorchester and Yeovil passes to the north of the village on the other side of the river&#x27;s water meadows. In the 2011 census the population of the parish (which includes the hamlet of Muckleford to the north-west) was 357.

Historian John Hutchins was born in Bradford Peverell in 1698. His work on the history of the county, &quot;History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset&quot;, was published in 1774.

In the 1st century a Roman aqueduct ran through where the village is now sited. It followed a line from Notton, a few miles upstream, to Dorchester, which then was the Roman town of Durnovaria. The remaining sections of the aqueduct are a scheduled monument.

St Mary&#x27;s parish church is a grade II* listed building. In 1850 it was rebuilt in a 13th/14th-century style, though various fittings and monuments were retained from the earlier building. The new design was by Decimus Burton.

The Frome Valley Trail long-distance footpath runs through the village.

<text>Joseph Carlton Loser (October 1, 1892 – July 31, 1984) was an American politician and a United States representative from Tennessee.

==Biography==
Loser (pronounced &quot;low-ser&quot;) was born in Davidson County, Tennessee, son of Henry James and Willie May McConnico Loser. He attended public schools and the former YMCA Law School (now Nashville School of Law). He was secretary to the mayor of Nashville from 1917 to 1920 and was admitted to the bar in 1922. In 1923 he completed the requirements for the LL. B. degree at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee.

==Career==
In 1923 Loser became assistant city attorney for Nashville, and in 1929 he became an assistant district attorney. He became district attorney for the former 10th Circuit, a position he held from 1934 until 1956. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1944, 1956, and 1960. He was a member of the United States Coast Guard Reserve in 1944; a presidential elector in 1956; and secretary of the Democratic Executive Committee of Tennessee from 1954 to 1958.

In 1956, 5th District Congressman Percy Priest died a month before the election. A special primary was held to replace Priest on the ballot, and Loser won the nomination. This was tantamount to victory a month later, as no Republican had been elected to Congress from Nashville since Reconstruction. He was re-elected in 1958 and 1960, and served from January 3, 1957, to January 3, 1963.

In August 1962 Loser had seemingly been renominated for a fourth term. However, an investigation into the primary election revealed serious irregularities. Loser&#x27;s major opponent in this contest was Richard Fulton. However, it was largely the instigation of a minor candidate, iron worker and labor union activist Raymond Love, that caused a re-examination of the primary by the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;. The &quot;Tennessean&quot; ran stories on its front page indicating a pattern of serious voter fraud, and a lawsuit was filed. The number of votes in question would not have in any event been adequate to have caused the election of Love, but could possibly have been enough to have thrown the election to Fulton. Love, stating that his only desire was one for a clean, honest election in any case, withdrew from the primary, which was rerun by court order. In the second primary, conducted under close scrutiny, Fulton defeated Loser decisively and went on to be elected that fall and to seven subsequent terms.

Loser withdrew from public life after his defeat.

==Personal life and death==
Loser&#x27;s father-in-law, William Gupton, served as the mayor of Nashville from 1917 to 1921.

Loser died on July 31, 1984 (age 91 years, 304 days) in Nashville. He is interred at Woodlawn Memorial Park, Nashville, Tennessee.

<text>Unio Trium Nationum (Latin for &quot;Union of the Three Nations&quot;) was a pact of mutual aid codified in 1437 by three Estates of Transylvania: the (largely Hungarian) nobility, the Saxon (German) patrician class (represented by the Transylvanian Saxon University), and the free military Székelys.
The union was directed against the whole of the peasantry, regardless of ethnicity, in response to the Transylvanian peasant revolt.

In this typical feudal estate parliament, the peasants (whether Hungarian, Saxon, Székely, or Romanian in origin) were not represented, and they did not benefit from its acts, as the commoners were not considered to be members of these feudal &quot;nations&quot;.

==Background==
===Medieval administrative structure in Transylvania===

In medieval times, Transylvania was organised into two separate types of territorial units: the Noble Counties (Comitates) were ruled by feudal landlords. Here, the majority of population were Hungarian and Romanian serfs. In other regions called Seats, the free Székely and Saxon nations lived without feudal landlords and had the royal privilege to have local authority and self-government.

===Events leading to the Union===
With the rise of the Ottoman Empire, one of the first major Ottoman military campaigns against Transylvanian parts of the Kingdom of Hungary was organised in 1421. The invading forces entered the region from Wallachia. The Saxons and Székelys living in the border area tried to defend themselves, but were heavily outnumbered by the intruders. King Sigismund was not able to react promptly because he had recently inherited the Bohemian throne and was involved there in the Hussite Wars. Also, Transylvanian Diets had not been organized for decades and there was no forum to coordinate defence preparations of the three nations. Left alone, the Saxon Burzenland and the Székely Seat of Háromszék, both in the border region, were ravaged. Sigismund reacted to the attack only years later, leading a series of military campaigns against the Ottomans in Wallachia. The Ottomans, allied with the Wallachian Voivode, returned in 1432 and Southern Transylvania suffered serious damages again.

In the same period, nobles and church authorities in Central Transylvania were concerned about protesting and revolting serfs. Hungarian and Romanian (Vlach) peasants were dissatisfied with high taxes and restrictions to their free movement. Scattered peasant protests turned into a serious revolt in 1437, when peasants and Hungarian nobles defeated the troops of the landholders. The Budai Nagy Antal Revolt was triggered by an attempt by the Bishop of Transylvania to collect taxes. Although the revolt was led by Hungarian noble Antal Nagy de Buda, it consisted of a coalition of various elements of Transylvanian society. This included Hungarian and Romanian serfs as well as the burghers of Kolozsvár (&quot;Klausenburg&quot;, &quot;Cluj&quot;), and resulted in the lower taxes codified by the Treaty of Kolozsmonostor. Pál Vajdaházi, one of the leaders of the revolt, was referred to in this document as &#x27; (Standard-bearer of the Union of Hungarian and Romanian inhabitants of this province of Hungary). Consequently, it is possible that the rebels considered themselves inhabitants of the Estate of Hungarians and Romanians (&#x27;).

===Brotherly Union (Union of Kápolna)===
Despite the pressing issues at hand, the Transylvanian Diet was still not called together by the Voivode, resulting in the various nobles initiating a meeting of the three nations. After a gap of almost half a century, the estates now had the opportunity to discuss Transylvanian issues together. On this occasion, the nobles set up an alliance with Székelys and Saxons who were still afraid of possible Ottoman incursions. The alliance of mutual aid, signed in Kápolna (present-day (Căpâlna), was called the &quot;Fraterna Unio&quot; (Brotherly Union), and was designed to protect the parties both from revolts and Ottoman attacks. While the existence of the Union helped the indigenous inhabitants to re-negotiate and partly modify the terms of the previous agreement, the alliance did not organize any serious military operations until the end of 1437. At that time, the alliance defeated the opposition after the death of King Sigismund in December.

==Founding of the Union of Three Nations==
After the successful campaign, the alliance of Hungarian nobles, Székelys, and Saxon elite was codified in the &quot;Unio Trium Nationum&quot; (&quot;Union of Three Nations&quot;) on February 2, 1438. Like the Brotherly Union, the new Union provided mutual aid against peasant revolts and Ottoman attacks. The Union ensured that the (Hungarian and Romanian) serfs continued to be excluded from the political life of Transylvania, although they were the majority of the population in the Noble Counties (&quot;Comitates&quot;). The Romanians adhered to Eastern Orthodoxy, which in predominantly Catholic Hungary was considered heretical.

The alliance of the three privileged estates was effective for centuries and provided the framework of internal and international relations of Transylvania. After the 18th century, when the danger of Ottoman or Tatar attacks was over, the Union became an alliance of the three estates to protect their vested rights from those who were not represented in the Transylvanian Diet. In the 19th century, the term &quot;three nations&quot; became charged with ethnic considerations, because Romanians were consequently excluded from Transylvanian government.

In 1711, the Bulgarians of Alvinc and Déva (led by church leader Balázs Marinovics) and the Armenians also claimed the privileges of a fourth and fifth &quot;natio&quot;, but their demands were not met with the elevation of their communities to that privileged status.

<text>Rummenohl, now officially Hagen-Rummenohl, is a locality within the independent city of Hagen in the eastern part of the Ruhr region, in Germany. It lies in the valley of the river Volme, about 13 km upstream (south) of the city centre of Hagen.

==History==
The former independent settlement of Dahl, consisting of Dahl, Priorei and Rummenohl, was incorporated in 1970 into the town of Breckerfeld in the district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of Ennepe-Ruhr. In 1975, the Parliament of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia decided to transfer it to the metropolitan district of Hagen.

=== Industrial history ===
Rummenohl has for centuries been a centre of ironworking, using the power of the river Volme to process iron ore from the Siegerland. The opening on 16 March 1874 of the single-track Volmetalbahn, which made a connection for goods traffic to Brügge (Lüdenscheid) and beyond that to Meinerzhagen, improved its integration into the developing Ruhr. Goods traffic to Lüdenscheid via Brügge was discontinued in early 1996.

In the early 1870s, Alfred Nobel founded a factory in Rummenohl to manufacture dynamite. On 5 June 1910 it was struck by lightning and exploded.

Beginning in 1908, gunpowder was manufactured in the valley of the Sterbecke, which flows into the Volme in Rummenohl. In peacetime, 100 people worked there; during World War I, the number rose to over 2,000. In wartime, the factory primarily produced landmines, cartridges and charges for grenades; after the war, it once more produced explosives for road construction and mining. A spur railway connected the distant factory on the heights near Selkinghausen to the Volmetal-Bahn railway line, negotiating the difference in height by means of several switchbacks. Beginning in 1926, the factory was gradually closed down. After World War II, the buildings served as accommodations for bombing victims and refugees. The building was torn down in the 1960s in the course of construction of the A45 Autobahn.

In 1918, a new church was built. The grain mill and former smithy at Krummewiese, on the northern edge of Rummenohl, which had been in operation since 1824, was shut down in 1952.</text><links>

<text>Bradpole is a village in the civil parish of Bridport, in south west Dorset, England, in the Brit valley, outside Bridport. In the 2011 census the population of the parish was 2,339.

In 1651 Charles II passed through Bradpole in his efforts to evade capture after he failed to sail to France from Charmouth following his defeat at the Battle of Worcester. An inscribed stone in the south of the parish, where Lee Lane meets the A35 trunk road between Bridport and Dorchester, marks the place where he took a turning off the main road to escape from his pursuers.

Bradpole is the birthplace of industrialist and Liberal Party politician William Edward Forster (1818–1886), who was instrumental in bringing through the 1870 Elementary Education Act. He is commemorated by the village Memorial Hall.

The parish church was built in 1845, following two previous buildings on the same site. Its communion cup dates from the 16th century. A chapel of ease, St Andrew&#x27;s, was built in 1858-60 and is now redundant.

The civil parish and parish council were abolished with effect from 1 April 2024, with the parish area taken into Bridport, part also went to Symondsbury.

<text>The River Towy (, ; also known as the River Tywi) is one of the longest rivers flowing entirely within Wales. Its total length is . It is noted for its sea trout and salmon fishing.

==Route==
The Towy rises within of the source of the River Teifi on the lower slopes of Crug Gynan in the Cambrian Mountains. Flowing through the steep hills of the Tywi Forest, it forms the boundary between Ceredigion and Powys. The river flows generally south-westwards through Carmarthenshire, passing through the towns of Llandovery and Llandeilo.

Its total length is . with numerous tributaries that include the Cothi, Gwili, Brân, and Doethie.

In Carmarthen, it is joined by a substantial tributary, the River Gwili, at Abergwili. The estuary meets Carmarthen Bay east of the Pendine Sands along with the River Taf and both branches of the River Gwendraeth. The estuary was guarded by Llansteffan Castle, a 12th-century Norman castle.

==Damming of the Towy==

About from its source, the swift flow of the Towy is interrupted by the Llyn Brianne reservoir, created in 1972 by damming a section of the river to store winter rain for release into the river during dry periods. The reservoir supports the new abstraction at Nantgaredig which supplies a large swathe of south-east Wales with drinking water. The flow in the River Towy would have been unable to sustain such an abstraction were it not for the release of water from the upland reservoir.

==Ecology==
===Fish===
The Towy is a national draw for big sea trout (local name &quot;sewin&quot;), the seagoing form of the brown trout, &quot;Salmo trutta&quot;. These fish enter the river each spring and early summer to breed in the tributaries. The river is thought to produce more double-figure (10 lbs plus, or about 5 kg or more) sea trout than any other in Britain. Anglers and estuary netsmen have taken these fish to over in weight. In summer and autumn there is also a substantial run of Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;). In May the Towy has a run of the rare and protected twaite shad and allis shad. The Towy also contains brown trout, eels, pike, and a variety of small fish species, and is home to brook lampreys, river lampreys and sea lampreys.

The Towy has the distinction of having accidentally produced by far the biggest fish ever taken on rod and line in fresh water in Britain. This was a sturgeon (&quot;Acipwienser sturio&quot;) weighing 388 lb (176 kg) and in length which was caught in the river near Nantgaredig by Alec Allen on 28 July 1932.
The last sturgeon in UK waters was seen in the river in 1993. 

===Mammals===
The Towy has a thriving population of otters, as well as many commoner mammal species. Grey seals are common in the lower reaches and sometimes penetrate several miles up river in pursuit of sea trout and salmon.

===Birds===
The Towy and surrounding valley () are home to a very large variety of water and wetland birds. Among the more distinctive species found along the river are sand martins, common sandpipers, little ringed plovers, dippers, kingfishers and grey wagtails. Red kites and buzzards are numerous. Goosanders and cormorants prey on sea trout and salmon.

===Plants===
The prevalence of oxbow lakes in the Towy valley provides some spectacular shows through the year. In summer at Bishop&#x27;s Pond in Abergwili (an oxbow lake formed when the river flooded in 1802) there is a spectacular show of yellow water lilies on the pond when the water level drops and reed sweet-grass fringes the edges – a species also found nearby in the Teifi valley further west in Pembrokeshire, in Gower, in Powys (especially along the Montgomery Canal), on Anglesey and in several sites along the North Wales coast.

==Glanrhyd Bridge disaster==
On 19 October 1987, three days after the Great Storm of 1987, four people were killed when a train plunged off Glanrhyd Bridge near Llangadog into the flooded river.

<text>Nathdwara is a city in the Rajsamand district of the state of Rajasthan, India. It is located in the Aravalli hills, on the banks of the Banas River and is 48 kilometres north-east of Udaipur. Shrinathji, is a swarup of lord Krishna which resembles his 7-year-old &quot;infant&quot; incarnation of Krishna. The deity was originally worshiped at Jatpura, Mathura and was shifted in the year 1672 from Govardhan hill, near Mathura along holy river Yamuna after being retained at Agra for almost six months. Literally, Nathdwara means &#x27;Gateway to Shrinathji (God)&#x27;. 

Nathdwara is a significant Vaishnavite shrine pertaining to the Pushti Marg or the Vallabh Sampradaya or the Shuddha Advaita founded by Vallabha Acharya, revered mainly by people of Gujarat and Rajasthan, among others. Vitthal Nathji, son of Vallabhacharya institutionalised the worship of Shrinathji at Nathdwara. Today also the Royal king family of Nathdwara belongs to the lineage of vallabhacharya mahaprabhuji. They are called Tilkayat or tikaet of Nathdwara.

Daily Eight Darshan opens for devotees as per schedule by temple. Mangala, Shringar, Gwala, Rajbhog, Uthapan, Aarti, and Shayan. 

Mobile phones, socks, and shoes are not allowed. There are lockers near the gate you can put your phone and shoes in. 

== Religion ==

=== Vallabha Sampradaya ===
The religion of the town of Nathdwara is centered on the Pushtimarg sect of Vaishnava Hinduism and primarlily the Shrinathji Temple.

==== Shrinathji Temple ====

The shrine at Nathdwara was built in the 17th century at the spot as exactly ordained by Shrinathji himself. The idol of the Lord Krishna was being transferred from Vrindaban to protect it from the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. When the idol reached the spot at village Sihad or Sinhad, the wheels of bullock cart in which the idol was being transported sank axle-deep in mud and could not be moved any further. The accompanying priests realised that the particular place was the Lord&#x27;s chosen spot and accordingly, a temple was built there under the rule and protection of the then Maharana Raj Singh of Mewar. Shrinathji Temple is also known as &#x27;Haveli of Shrinathji&#x27; (mansion).

==== Naveet Priya and Madan Mohan Temples ====
The idol of Naveet Priya came to Nathdwara with Shrinathji and is the form of Krishna as a child. Madan Mohan was gifted to Shri Nathji by the wife of Maharana Fateh Singh of Udaipur and Mewar. These two temples are under the same administration as the Shrinathji Temple.

==== Vithal Nath Temple ====
The image of Vithal Nath is the second of the seven svarups of the Pushtimarg sect. Its administration is separate from that of the above temples.

=== Other ===
Other deities worshipped in temples in the town include Khera Mata, Mahadeva, Hanuman, Mataji (in various forms), and Thakurji (non-Vallabhite Vaishnava temples). There is also a small presence of Islam and Jainism.

<text>Radio Flyer is a 1992 American drama-fantasy film directed by Richard Donner and written by David Mickey Evans. It stars Lorraine Bracco, John Heard, Elijah Wood, Joseph Mazzello, Adam Baldwin, and Ben Johnson and is narrated by Tom Hanks. Evans was to make his directorial debut on the film but was replaced by Donner. Michael Douglas and Evans were executive producers. Filming locations included Novato, California, and Columbia Airport in Columbia, California.

==Plot==
Mike observes his two sons fighting, with one insisting that a promise doesn&#x27;t mean anything. To help them understand that a promise does mean something, he tells them the story of his youth. In 1969, 11-year-old Mike, 8-year-old Bobby, their mother, Mary, and their German Shepherd, Shane, relocate from New Jersey to Novato, California after their father/husband leaves them,but caused during his father&#x27;s lifetime when he died at an unknown early age. There, Mary weds a new man named Jack MacKenzie, who the children call &quot;The King&quot;. Unbeknownst to Mary, The King is an alcoholic who often gets drunk and beats Bobby. The King also repeatedly plays Hank Williams’s &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot; on his record player.

Seeing that Mary has found happiness at last with The King, Bobby swears Mike to secrecy about the abuse. Instead, the two boys seek adventures to occupy the time that would otherwise be spent with The King; they recount the &quot;seven great abilities and fascinations&quot; of childhood while exploring their new surroundings and dealing with the neighborhood bullies. An unsupervised incident in the kitchen in which the boys attempt to create an anti-monster potion to get rid of The King leads to Bobby being hospitalized by The King, but Shane gets revenge on The King by violently biting him on the arm. After spending time in jail, The King is released following the death of his mother and returns to their house with flowers and chocolates promising never to drink or abuse Bobby again; he violates his promise while the boys are at school and nearly kills Shane. As a result, the brothers devise a plan for Bobby to escape The King once and for all. Mary also starts to catch on to The King&#x27;s true nature and finally requests a divorce.

Inspired by the urban legend of a boy named Fisher who attempted to fly away on his bicycle over a cliff nicknamed “The Wishing Spot”, the two convert their eponymous Radio Flyer toy wagon into an airplane in the hopes of sending Bobby and Shane away from harm. They draw up a schematic diagram with wings and an engine and scavenge numerous parts, secretly using The King&#x27;s tools to build the aircraft in their shed. The boys also raise money through various means, such as retrieving lost balls on a golf course and selling them back to the golfers. After leaving a farewell letter for their mother, the brothers take the device to the cliff at night, but The King discovers their plan and attempts to stop them, prompting Shane to furiously attack him. Bobby then speeds down the hill alone (knocking out The King with the wing of his plane) and triumphantly soars into the air as Mike and Shane look on. Mary arrives with police officer Jim Daugherty and Daugherty arrests The King and Mary gets divorced. Though Mike never sees Bobby again, he continues to receive postcards from him from places all over the world.

Back in the present, Mike reiterates to his sons the importance of keeping a promise, and imparts a lesson about history being in the mind of the teller. He concludes his story by saying, &quot;That’s how I remember it.&quot;

==Production==
David Mickey Evans&#x27;s script for &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; was a hot property around Hollywood, and Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures started a bidding war around it in November 1989. Warner had eyes on it as a vehicle for veteran director Richard Donner, while Columbia was buying it on behalf of Michael Douglas&#x27;s production outfit Stonebridge Entertainment, which had a major production deal with the latter studio. Just before Thanksgiving, Columbia paid Evans a huge sum for a first-time Hollywood screenwriter: $1.25 million. The deal also gave Evans the opportunity to direct even though he had no prior experience helming a film. Douglas, however, believed Evans had the vision to pull it off. This was the first film Columbia put into production under the ownership of Sony, as well as one of the first films to be greenlit by the studio&#x27;s new management, led by Peter Guber and Jon Peters.

Filming started on June 18, 1990. Under Evans&#x27;s direction, the film starred Rosanna Arquette as the mother, Tomas Arana as Jack, and Luke Edwards and James Badge Dale as the children. The budget was set at $17–18 million after Evans agreed to cut some expensive effects sequences. However, Stonebridge executives found the dailies disappointing, and after 10 days of filming, Douglas shut down production, at a loss of $5 million. Douglas then recruited Richard Donner as the film&#x27;s new director. With Evans&#x27;s blessing, Donner accepted with a $5 million paycheck, while his wife, producer Lauren Shuler Donner, came on board. Evans remained on the film as an executive producer. With the major players recast, &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; resumed production that October. Donner had Evans rewrite the script extensively to find a way to balance escapist fantasy and child abuse without alienating the audience.

The film&#x27;s original ending featured a present-day coda where a now-adult Mike, played by Tom Hanks, takes his children to the National Air and Space Museum, where the Radio Flyer/Plane hybrid is displayed next to the Wright Brothers&#x27; flying machine. Test audiences were confused by this ending and re-shoots led to the modern-day prologue and epilogue seen in the final film.

A video game adaption of the film was being developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Ocean Software.

The film was dedicated to the memory of script supervisor Nancy Benta Hansen and uncredited production assistant Simone Fuentes, &quot;whose professionalism and humor we miss.&quot;

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 35% based on reviews from 40 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;Overlaying its whimsical concept onto a gritty story of domestic abuse, &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; is a family film that is too harrowing for children and too saccharine for their parents.&quot;

Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin both criticized the film for presenting fantasy as a way of escaping child abuse. Said Ebert, &quot;I was so appalled, watching this kid hurtling down the hill in his pathetic contraption, that I didn&#x27;t know which ending would be worse. If he fell to his death, that would be unthinkable, but if he soared up to the moon, it would be unforgivable—because you can&#x27;t escape from child abuse in little red wagons, and even the people who made this picture should have been ashamed to suggest otherwise.&quot;

Because the film in fact ends with Bobby successfully evading his stepfather forever, viewers (including Ebert himself) have taken to speculating on the &quot;true&quot; ending, assuming that the one presented was a case of an unreliable narrator.

In a 2004 interview promoting Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Elijah Wood recalled his time on Radio Flyer fondly. He praised Richard Donner as an &quot;amazing&quot; director and remembered the warm atmosphere on set. He particularly recalled celebrating his tenth birthday during the shoot, with Donner giving gifts to both him and co-star Joseph Mazzello to ensure no one felt left out. Wood highlighted that it was a fun and positive experience.

<text>The Siegerland is a region of Germany covering the old district of Siegen (now part of the district of Siegen-Wittgenstein in North Rhine-Westphalia) and the upper part of the district of Altenkirchen, belonging to the Rhineland-Palatinate adjoining it to the west.

Geologically, the Siegerland belongs to the Rhenish Massif (Rheinisches Schiefergebirge, &quot;Rhenish Slate Mountains&quot;). The point of highest elevation is the &quot;Riemen&quot;, at 678 metres above sea level. The river Sieg, a right tributary of the river Rhine, has its source in the town of Netphen in the Rothaar Mountains.

The region around the city of Siegen is centered in the middle of Germany. It includes the municipalities of Hilchenbach, Netphen, Kreuztal, Freudenberg and Siegen, and the communities of Wilnsdorf, Burbach and Neunkirchen, all in North Rhine-Westphalia, and in the Rhineland-Palatinate the municipalities of Kirchen, Herdorf and Betzdorf, with the community of Daaden. The population is approximately 300,000.

The region also has a dialect Siegerländisch which is spoken by many of its inhabitants.

<doc id="1071482" wikidata="Q7889891" url="?curid=1071482" title="United States Fleet">
<text>The United States Fleet was an organization in the United States Navy from 1922 until after World War II. The acronym CINCUS, pronounced &quot;sink us&quot;, was used for the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. This was replaced by COMINCH in December, 1941, under the , when it was redefined and given operational command over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic Fleets, as well as all naval coastal forces. The authorized the offices of the CNO and COMINCH to be held by a single officer; Admiral Ernest J. King was first to do so, and in 1944 was promoted to the five-star rank of fleet admiral.

==Establishment==
The directive of 6 December 1922 combined the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the U.S. Atlantic Fleet to form the United States Fleet. The main body of its ships, the Battle Fleet, was stationed in the Pacific Ocean and the Scouting Fleet was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, the &quot;Control Force&quot;, protecting the Atlantic sea lanes, and the &quot;Fleet Base Force&quot; were included. Remaining independent of the United States Fleet were the Asiatic Fleet, the Naval Forces in Europe, the Special Service Squadron (Caribbean), and all U.S. Navy submarines.

During 1930, the Battle Fleet and Scouting Fleet were renamed the Battle Force and the Scouting Force. The Submarine Force was also placed under control of the CINCUS. The Control Force was abolished in 1931. The Special Service Squadron and the Asiatic Fleet were retained, both still apparently independent of the U.S. Fleet. The United States Fleet was reorganized on 1 April 1931 into Battle Force, Scouting Force, Submarine Force, and Base Force.

==Reorganization in 1941==
With the start of World War II in Europe, the U.S. Navy began to plan for the possibility of war in the Atlantic as well as the Pacific. On 1 February 1941, General Order 143 was issued, abolishing the &quot;United States Fleet&quot; organization. In its place, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and the U.S. Pacific Fleet were re-established, each under its own commander in chief. The Asiatic Fleet remained an independent organization as before.

The additional title of Commander in Chief, United States Fleet was given to one of the three fleet commanders (Atlantic, Pacific, or Asiatic) in the event of two or more fleets operating together. Except for this provision, the individual commanders in chief were responsible directly to the President of the United States and the Secretary of the Navy.

Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel was appointed the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CINCUS) and the Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) on 1 February 1941, carrying the temporary rank of admiral starting on that date. Kimmel was relieved as the CINCUS / CINCPAC on 17 December 1941, shortly after the devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

On the following day, by of 18 December 1941, the position of Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (COMINCH) was redefined, and given operational command over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic Fleets, as well as all naval coastal forces. The acronym change from CINCUS to COMINCH was suggested by Admiral Ernest J. King, who feared that the pronunciation of the post would be demoralizing in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack. On 20 December, Admiral Ernest J. King was assigned as the COMINCH. One important difference from the previous post of CINCUS was that Admiral King insisted that his headquarters would always be in Washington, D.C., rather than with the Fleet.

Dividing command of the Navy between the COMINCH, Admiral King, and the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral Harold R. Stark, did not prove to be very effective. President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed this problem with his of 12 March 1942, which designated that the offices of the CNO and COMINCH would be held by a single officer, and Admiral King was selected to be CNO in addition to being COMINCH. King relieved Stark as CNO on 29 March 1942, and wore both of these &quot;hats&quot; for the remainder of the war.

==Abolition==

After the war, the position of Commander in Chief, United States Fleet was no longer needed. Thus, on September 29, 1945, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9635, which revoked both EO 8984 &amp; EO 9096 and transferred all the responsibilities of the COMINCH to the CNO. Since that time, the CNO has nearly always been the highest-ranking U.S. Navy officer. Following passage of the National Security Act of 1947, the CNO is by law the highest-ranking naval officer on active duty, except when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (a position created by the 1949 amendments of the National Security Act) and/or the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (a position created by the Goldwater-Nichols Act in 1986) is also a U.S. Navy officer.

<doc id="1071486" wikidata="Q1708157" url="?curid=1071486" title="Joseph W. Byrns Jr.">
<text>Joseph Wellington Byrns Jr. (August 15, 1903 – March 8, 1973) was an American attorney and one-term U.S. Representative from Tennessee.

==Biography==
Byrns was born in Davidson County, Tennessee, the son of former House Speaker Joseph W. Byrns and Julia Woodard. He completed his schooling at the Emerson Institute in Washington, D.C. in 1923 while his father was serving in Congress. In 1928, he graduated from the Vanderbilt University Law School and was admitted to the bar the same year. Byrns was first married to Cornelia Park in 1929, but the marriage ended in divorce. It is said that Cornelia liked being Mrs. Joseph W. Byrns Jr., and for the rest of her life refused to acknowledge the divorce. Byrns later enjoyed a happy marriage to Mrs. Lillie (Warmack) Adams of Goodlettsville, Tennessee.

==Career==
From 1930 to 1938, Byrns was a member of the reserve component of the former Army Air Corps, where he became a captain.

In 1938, Byrns won the Democratic nomination for his father&#x27;s old House seat and was elected to that office in November of that year. He served that one term, from January 3, 1939 to January 3, 1941, and won the Democratic nomination for a second one in 1940. His vote for an amendment that would have postponed the operation of the Selective Service Act by 60 days helped to inspire opposition from an independent candidate named Percy Priest, who was a member of the editorial staff of the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;. Priest defeated Byrns by a 50%-43% margin (24,565 votes to 20,933 votes, with 3,459 votes going to the Republican nominee). After his defeat, he resumed the practice of law.

Byrns served on active duty in the United States Army during World War II, from June 23, 1942 until August 17, 1945, almost all of this time in the European Theater of Operations.

Although Byrns achieved some stature during his life, he was always overshadowed by the successes and popularity of his father. Afterwards, he retired to Florida.

==Death==
Byrns died in Daytona Beach, Florida on March 8, 1973, aged 69, and is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville along with his parents and second wife.

<doc id="1071488" wikidata="Q212756" url="?curid=1071488" title="David Suazo">
<text>Óscar David Suazo Velázquez (born 5 November 1979) is a Honduran retired professional footballer turned coach who played as a striker. Suazo played more than 300 league games and scored over 90 league goals in Italy during a span of 12 seasons.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Nicknamed &quot;La Pantera&quot; (The Panther) or &quot;El Rey David&quot; (The King David), Suazo was born in San Pedro Sula. In his early career, he developed alongside his cousin, Maynor Suazo, who also went on to play for the Honduras national team. Suazo took his first steps at Olimpia Reserves and later went on to play at the Liga Bancaria. After his participation in 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, he was acquired by domestic club team Olimpia. He continued to impress playing for Olimpia&#x27;s youth system under the coaching of the late Angel Ramón Paz (&quot;Mon Paz&quot;) and earned a spot on the top squad before turning 20 years old.

===Cagliari===
Óscar Tabárez, then-coach of Italian side Cagliari, was impressed by Suazo&#x27;s performance and did not hesitate in bringing him to Europe, for US$2 million transfer fee and US$200,000 tax to National Autonomous Federation of Football of Honduras, as well as 15–20% of the future capital gain if Cagliari sold the player above the US$2.2 million price tag. Suazo officially joined the club ahead of the 1999–2000 Serie A season. In his first year with the team, he scored one goal in 13 league appearances, and at the end of the 1999–2000 season, Cagliari were relegated to Serie B where they would remain until the 2003–04 season

===Internazionale===
On 13 June 2007, reports arose that Suazo had agreed terms with Serie A champions Internazionale. Six days later, however, crosstown rivals and reigning European champions Milan announced that they themselves had acquired Suazo. While Milan claimed they had successfully negotiated with Cagliari, the deal with Inter was confirmed by Cagliari chairman Massimo Cellino. Meanwhile, one of Suazo&#x27;s agents, Carlo Pallavicino, added to the confusion by saying, &quot;Suazo has not had any contact with Milan and he still has not given his consent to the transfer.&quot; It was later announced that Suazo was confirmed with Inter on 26 June for €14 million fee (with about US$2.5 million was required to pay by Cagliari to Olimpia) after Milan officially withdrew their contract offer. Since Suazo himself wanted to keep his initial agreement with Inter. &quot;It was an issue of respect. The &quot;Rossoneri&quot; (nickname of Milan) understood that I had a promise with coach Roberto Mancini, Marco Branca and chairman Massimo Moratti.&quot; He scored his first Inter goal against Genoa and scored a total of eight goals throughout his first season with the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; (the nickname of Inter).

===Loans===
After a less-than-impressive first season with Inter, Suazo was loaned to Portuguese club Benfica for the 2008–09 season. Suazo however, appeared in just 12 league matches and scored just four goals during the season. Following his return to Inter in June 2009, he was given limited squad space and failed to make any starts for his club.

On 29 December 2009, it was confirmed that Suazo had been authorized to play friendly match for Genoa, two days before the opening of the winter transfer window. After the opening of the transfer window, Suazo officially joined Genoa on a six-month loan deal, where he replaced Sergio Floccari, who was transferred to Lazio on 4 January. This was part of a deal that completed a three-way, three-man swap in which Inter also received Goran Pandev from Lazio on free transfer.

Suazo made his debut for Genoa against Milan in a losing effort, appearing on the scoresheet in the process. He scored the second goal for Genoa and was eventually substituted in the 80th minute for Hernán Crespo. His loan with Genoa proved to be highly unsuccessful, as the player scored a mere 2 goals in 16 Serie A appearances.

===Return to Inter===
After his Genoa loan expired, Suazo returned to Inter but, in part because of a long-term injury, he was not included in the first-team, thus failing to make a single appearance in the entire 2010–11 season. Suazo&#x27;s contract with Inter expired on 30 June 2011, leaving the player without a contract. Since then, he was linked with a comeback at Cagliari following a trial period. This was a possibility that was later confirmed by club chairman Massimo Cellino, who, on 13 July 2011, confirmed Suazo&#x27;s return to Sardinia by the end of the transfer window, and defined his signing as &quot;a cherry on the pie&quot;. The transfer, however, collapsed after Suazo was asked to leave Cagliari&#x27;s pre-season camp after Cellino opted against the move and changed his decision about the transfer.

===Catania===

On 12 August 2011, Suazo signed for Catania on a one-year deal. He was officially presented on the same day alongside new arrivals Mario Paglialunga and Davide Lanzafame. Suazo was assigned the number 9 jersey, though only would make six appearances during his time in Sicily, which ended upon the expiration of his contract on 30 June 2012.

On 27 March 2013, at the age of 33, he announced his retirement from football, due to his persisting struggles with knee injuries.

==International career==
Suazo played for the Honduras national under-20 football team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship. He made his senior debut for Honduras in a May 1999 friendly match against Haiti and has earned a total of 57 caps, scoring 17 goals. He has represented his country in 30 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He also played at the 2000 Summer Olympics and at the 2003 UNCAF Nations Cup as well as at the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He also played a few minutes of Honduras&#x27; first match at the 2001 Copa América.

His final international appearance came on 12 June 2012, in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Canada.

==Post-playing and coaching career==
Following his retirement as a player, Suazo was hired by his former team Cagliari as a scout. In 2014, he joined the first team coaching staff as an assistant to Ivo Pulga for the final part of the season; he successively was appointed to the same role by the end of the 2014–15 season, supporting new head coach Gianluca Festa.

For the 2015–16 season, he was named new youth team coach for the &quot;Giovanissimi Nazionali&quot;.

On 5 June 2018, he was appointed manager of Serie B side Brescia by Massimo Cellino, former chairman of his while at Cagliari. He was however sacked on 18 September 2018 after a negative start to the new season.

On 13 May 2021, Suazo returned into management as the new head coach of struggling Sardinian Serie D side Carbonia. After guiding Carbonia to safety, on 31 July 2021 he agreed a two-year contract extension with the club. On 24 June 2022, Carbonia and Suazo parted ways, following the team&#x27;s relegation to Eccellenza at the end of the 2021–22 Serie D season.

==Style of play==
A quick and physically strong striker, Suazo is considered to be one of the greatest players Honduras has ever produced. His main characteristic as a forward was his incredible speed, both on and off the ball, which made him arguably one of the fastest Serie A players of his time. His pace and acceleration made him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks and allowed him to create space and provide depth to his team with his runs from behind. In spite of his ability, however, he was often injury prone throughout his career. He also possessed notable determination and great leadership skills on the pitch, serving as Cagliari&#x27;s captain. Suazo also took several penalties and occasionally scored from free kicks.

==Personal life==
David&#x27;s brothers are Nicolás and Ruben Suazo. Former internationals Maynor Suazo and Hendry Thomas are his cousins. He holds Italian nationality due to his marriage to an Italian woman, Elisa Secchi, in 2005. They have two sons, David Edoardo and Luis Gabriel, with the latter (born 2008) having followed on his father&#x27;s footsteps and having been signed by Juventus in 2022, joining the Under-15 team.

<text>Arthur Hughes (June 24, 1894 – December 28, 1982) was an American actor on the stage, radio and films. On Broadway, he performed in two dozen plays between 1923 and 1968, including &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1931–32) and &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot; (1930–31). On television he appeared in &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

Hughes played Steven Dallas on the radio soap opera &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; and was perhaps best known as title character Bill Davidson on the long-running daytime radio serial, &quot;Just Plain Bill&quot;. He also acted in other well-known radio programs such as the &quot;Fu Manchu Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons&quot;. During the 1960s, he appeared in several TV movies. He also appeared in films, including &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974) and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Bananas&quot; (1971).

Hughes and Edward Pawley, of &quot;Big Town&quot; fame, were good friends. They were roommates in their early years in New York City where they were appearing in Broadway plays. They appeared together in a popular Broadway production titled &quot;Subway Express&quot; (1929). Hughes was a witness at Pawley&#x27;s marriage to his first wife, stage actress Martina May Martin, in 1922.

<text>The Volme is a river in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and is a tributary of the river Ruhr. It is long, of which about lie within the city limits of Hagen. Its largest tributary is the Ennepe.

The Volme rises at above sea level in the southeastern part of the Ruhr region, southeast of the town Meinerzhagen. It flows through the municipalities of Meinerzhagen, Kierspe, Halver (Oberbrügge), Lüdenscheid (Brügge), Schalksmühle and Hagen and empties into the Ruhr at above sea level. In the city of Hagen, the Volme is predominantly canalised, and since 2004 has been under restoration.

Tributaries of the Volme are, from the mouth upstream:
*Ennepe (in Hagen centre)
*Sterbecke (in Hagen-Rummenohl)
*Hälver (in Schalksmühle)
*Elspe (in Lüdenscheid-Brügge)
*Wiebelsaat (in Meinerzhagen)

==Industrial development==
In the pre-industrial age, numerous mills, smithies and foundries arose along the Volme, from which the iron industry developed during the 19th and the 20th centuries. The Hagen–Dieringhausen railway runs through the valley.

<doc id="1071501" wikidata="Q7471" url="?curid=1071501" title="Emperor Taizu of Song">
<text>Emperor Taizu of Song (21 March 927 – 14 November 976), personal name Zhao Kuangyin, courtesy name Yuanlang, was the founding emperor of the Song dynasty of China. He reigned from 960 until his death in 976. Formerly a distinguished military general of the Later Zhou dynasty, Emperor Taizu came to power after staging a coup d&#x27;état and forcing Emperor Gong, the last Later Zhou ruler, to abdicate the throne in his favor.

During his reign, Emperor Taizu conquered the states of Southern Tang, Later Shu, Southern Han, and Jingnan, thus reunifying most of China proper. To strengthen his control, he lessened the power of military generals and relied on civilian officials in administration. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Zhao Kuangyi (Emperor Taizong).

==Early life==
Born in Luoyang to military commander Zhao Hongyin, Zhao Kuangyin grew up excelling in mounted archery. Once, riding an untamed horse without a bridle, he knocked his forehead on the wall above the city gate and fell off, but got right back up and chased the horse, eventually subduing it while going unharmed. In the mid-940s, he married Lady He on his father&#x27;s arrangement. After wandering around for a few years, in 949 he joined the army of Guo Wei, a &quot;jiedushi&quot; (military governor) of the Later Han dynasty, and helped Guo quell Li Shouzhen&#x27;s rebellion.

==Career under Later Zhou==
In 951, Guo Wei rebelled and created the Later Zhou dynasty. Because of his brilliant combat skills, Zhao Kuangyin was promoted to a palace guard commander. Chai Rong (Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou) frequently met Guo Wei and noticed Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s potential. Under his command, Zhao Kuangyin was made into a commander of the cavalry units. Under Chai Rong, Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s rise to power had begun.

Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s career started at the Battle of Gaoping, against the alliance of the Northern Han and Liao dynasties.

This rivalry started when Chai Rong ascended the throne and Liu Chong decided to work with the Liao dynasty. In the initial confrontation, the army&#x27;s right flank, led by Fan Aineng () and He Hui (), was defeated. Looking at the situation, Zhao Kuangyin and Zhang Yongde () led 4000 elite Palace troops to counter the Liao army. Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s exhortation for the loyalty to the emperor quickly strengthened morale. The small force held off the larger Liao army until reinforcements arrived. In the end, the successful counter repelled the Northern Han back to Taiyuan.

The victory raised Zhao Kuangyin up to the post of the grand commander of the palace guards, as well as reorganising and training them. More importantly, he developed the relations with other generals and officials related to the Chief of Palace, including Shi Shouxin, Wang Shenqi (), Yang Guangyi (), Wang Zhengzhong (), Liu Qingyi (), Liu Shouzhong (), Liu Yanrang (), Mi Xin (), Tian Chongjin (), Pan Mei, his brother Zhao Kuangyi, Shen Yilun (), Lu Xuqing, Zhao Pu (), Chu Zhaofu (). Within a few years, Zhao Kuangyin completely controlled the palace guards and even developed a set of officials under him with the people mentioned above.

Soon, he was promoted to a &quot;jiedushi&quot; (military governor), controlling most of the military power under Chai Rong. Nevertheless, he still had two rivals – Zhang Yongde (Guo Wei&#x27;s son-in-law) and Li Chongjin (Guo Wei&#x27;s nephew). In 959, after a trap set by Zhao Kuangyin, Zhang Yongde was demoted. After the death of Chai Rong, the Later Zhou throne was left to his seven-year-old son Guo Zongxun, and the second rival, Li Chongjin, soon found himself lacking the political backing. As a result, Zhao Kuangyin was able to use his influence to transfer Li Chongjin to Yang Prefecture as a &quot;jiedushi&quot;.

==Chenqiao Mutiny==

In 960, word reached the chancellor Fan Zhi that Northern Han and Liao dynasties were once again allied to invade them again. Without verifying the reliability of the hearsay, Fan Zhi sent Zhao Kuangyin to combat the alliance. After traveling 40 &quot;li&quot;, there was a clamour that a &quot;prophet&quot; saw two suns fighting, and that this meant the transfer of the Mandate of Heaven to Zhao Kuangyin. The story effectively spread around the army: there came discontent of the &quot;command&quot; of the young emperor and a shift of loyalty to Zhao Kuangyin. A few days later, when Zhao Kuangyin was drunk in his tent, all the troops had not slept the whole night; they got their weapons and started yelling. Zhao Pu and Zhang Kuangyi, who were guarding the tent, saw the situation and went into the tent to wake up Zhao Kuangyin. When Zhao Kuangyin came out, all the troops yelled, &quot;The army is without a master, we are willing to make the general the new emperor.&quot; Allegedly, Zhao Kuangyin took the power reluctantly, only under the urging of his soldiers. The midnight mutiny of officers forcibly urged Zhao Kuangyin to the throne; but, when the officers presented him to the troops as their new commander-in-chief he refused the imperial nomination until they swore unconditional obedience to him as leader. News of the rebellion soon reached the court and chaos erupted. The only person who thought about a resistance was Han Tong, but he was killed by one of Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s generals when he reached home.

Upon entering the capital to take his seat on the throne, Zhao Kuangyin made an executive order prohibiting the troops from looting the city or otherwise violating the rights of the population.

This coup would allow Zhao Kuangyin to become emperor in 960. With the gates opened for him, he became emperor with no resistance. Before the chancellor Fan Zhi could say anything, one of Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s generals pointed a sword at him and said, &quot;We are without masters. Today, we must have an emperor.&quot; After the officials looked at each other and knew it was hopeless to resist; they all bowed down. With the court under control, Zhao Kuangyin was officially proclaimed emperor. The new dynasty&#x27;s name, Song, was inspired by the army Zhao Kuangyin commanded in Song Prefecture.

After the declaration, Zhao Kuangyin sent the dethroned young emperor Guo Zongxun with his mother to the Western Capital (). He personally ordered the Zhao family to receive the Chai family into their family&#x27;s care for generations.

==As emperor==
In 960, Zhao Kuangyin helped reunite most of China proper after the fragmentation and rebellion between the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907 and the establishment of the Song dynasty. The plan set during Chai Rong&#x27;s reign was to first conquer the north, then the south. During Emperor Taizu&#x27;s reign, there was a change in strategy. He would conquer all the smaller states such as Later Shu, Southern Han and Southern Tang. The exception was the strong Northern Han in the north at Taiyuan supported by the Khitans of the Liao dynasty. Emperor Taizu&#x27;s strategy was to win over the independent southern states as the south was weaker than the north as the Liao dynasty supported Northern Han.

In 968, Emperor Taizu personally led the army against the Northern Han. At first, his forces tore through the defences and placed Taiyuan under siege, but was ultimately forced to retreat after he struck against the defences of the Northern Han with the Liao cavalry coming in to support.Emperor Taizu established the core Song Ancestor Rules and Policy for the later Song emperors. He was remembered for his expansion of the imperial examination system such that most of the civil service were recruited through the exams (in contrast to the Tang where less than 10% of the civil servants came through exams). He also created academies that allowed a great deal of freedom of discussion and thought, which facilitated the growth of scientific advance, economic reforms as well as achievements in arts and literature.

Emperor Taizu is well known for bringing the power of the military under control, ending the era of the warlords, centralizing the state over regional commanders and so preventing anyone else rising to power as he did. Upon becoming emperor, he invited the general officers to a lavish banquet, where he convinced them all to retire as military leaders or accept minor posts, in favour of enjoying extensive estates and generous retirement funds and benefits which he then offered them. At a certain point during the feast, the new emperor made a speech to the military officers assembled there, which he began by expressing his deep gratitude to each and all of them for placing him on the throne, and that now that he had the power to do so, he wished to reward them to the utmost of his ability; then he went on to say that he thought the present company would all understand that he could not feel at ease on his new throne, with them continuing in command of their various armies of troops: and, he said, that if they duly considered the ramifications of the matter, neither would they. He then sincerely promised that they and their families would live in happiness and harmony, if they accepted his offer to retire with the stated benefits: eventually, none of the generals refused his terms, and thus began a period of relative internal peace within the realm for the duration of the Song dynasty which he thus founded, also better securing the military forces for involvement with the rival surrounding empires.

Many Song and later sources record the story of the &quot;Taizu&#x27;s Oath&quot;, which forbade his successors from killing scholar-officials. However, this story might be a later construct.

Emperor Taizu established a Reserve Treasury as a deposit treasury for the purpose of either attempting to purchase the Sixteen Prefectures or to recover them through funding military action. He launched a military expedition to recover them before his death, and his successor attempted twice more, leading to twenty-five years of sporadic fighting between the Song and the Khitan Liao.

==Death and succession dispute==

Emperor Taizu reigned for seventeen years and died in 976 at the age of 49. Curiously, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Zhao Kuangyi (Emperor Taizong), even though he had two grown sons – Zhao Dezhao, the Prince of Yan (951–979), and Zhao Defang, the Prince of Qin (959–981). The traditional historical accounts place emphasis on the role Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s mother played in the decision which was made shortly after the Song dynasty was proclaimed (around 961). So for nearly his entire reign, it was known and accepted that Zhao Kuangyi would succeed him.

In folklore, the story known as &quot;shadows by the candle and sounds from an axe&quot; is very popular and suggests that Emperor Taizu was murdered by his brother, who was after the throne. After his death, Taizu was interred at the Yongchang Mausoleum, near Gongyi. 

After Emperor Taizong, the line of succession passed on to his son and descendants rather than those of Emperor Taizu. However, when Emperor Gaozong (1127–1161) failed to produce an heir, he selected a descendant of Emperor Taizu to be his adopted heir to succeed him in 1161. After 1161, all the subsequent Song emperors were descended from Emperor Taizu through his two sons, Zhao Dezhao and Zhao Defang.

==Family==

Zhao Kuangyin&#x27;s family was of fairly modest origins and cannot be traced back with any certainty further than the Later Tang. His great great grandfather Zhao Tiao was an official who served in Zhuozhou in Hebei Province near where the family lived. His descendants Zhao Ting and Zhao Jing also served as local officials in Hebei Province. Zhao Jing&#x27;s son Zhao Hongyin decided against a civil career and became a military officer instead under Zhuangzong of Later Tang: he knew that in times of disunity it would be a military career that would lead to success.

==In popular culture==
===Religion===
The Great Ancestor of the Song sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples in partnership with Yang Gun.

===Literature===
The late 16th century novel by Xiong Damu () called &quot;Records of the Two Songs, South and North&quot; () is a historical novel about imperial China from roughly 926 to 1022. The first 50 chapters detail the fall of Later Tang and the rise and fall of Later Jin, Later Han and Later Zhou, with a focus on the legends of Zhao Kuangyin. The last 50 chapters focus on the &quot;Generals of the Yang Family&quot; legends. As a result, the book is in later publications usually split in two separate parts under various different names.

A 1797 novel written by Wu Xuan () called &quot;Legends of the Flying Dragon&quot; () proved to be very popular in his time. He expanded the stories on Zhao Kuangyin in Xiong Damu&#x27;s book and added a &quot;wuxia&quot; twist to it. Another novel &quot;Emperor Taizu of Song Thrice Sets off for Southern Tang, Trapped in Shouzhou City&quot; () was written by an &quot;Antiquarian Master&quot; () in 1858.

While these stories mostly use historical figures as supporting characters, a number of fictional characters became famously associated with Zhao Kuangyin:

* Zhao Jingniang (), a beautiful teenage girl whom Zhao Kuangyin saved from kidnappers and protected during her journey home. She developed strong romantic feelings about Zhao Kuangyin, but he only regarded her as a younger sister. She eventually committed suicide when a misunderstanding occurred.
* Zheng En (), courtesy name Ziming (), the third sworn brother of Zhao Kuangyin and Chai Rong in the stories. He is portrayed as dark-skinned, strong and loyal, with a simple temperament. He was accidentally killed by a drunk Zhao Kuangyin.

===Martial arts===
According to martial arts traditional lore, Emperor Taizu created a Shaolin-based fighting style known as &quot;Taizu Changquan&quot; (太祖長拳; literally &quot;Taizu Long Fist&quot;). It is the core style of the present-day Long Fist style. Whether he really did invent this style or if it even dates from this time is not actually known.

===Films===
A Chinese 4D film tentatively titled &quot;Unifying the Country&quot; () is planned to be directed by Academy Award–winning Danish director Bille August. The film is said to center on Zhao Kuangyin as well as Li Yu (last ruler of Southern Tang) and Qian Chu (last ruler of Wuyue).

===Television series===
* &quot;Military Control&quot; (), a 1988 Hong Kong series starring Gordon Liu as Zhao Kuangyin.
* &quot;Zhao Kuangyin&quot; (), a 1995 Chinese series starring Zhao Xiguang as Zhao Kuangyin.
* &quot;The Preordained Emperor&quot; (), a 1998 Taiwanese series starring Lin You-hsing as Zhao Kuangyin.
* &quot;Zhao Kuangyin&quot; (), a 2013 Chinese series starring Chen Jianbin as Zhao Kuangyin.
* A Change of Destiny is a 2007 TVB series in which Zhao Kuangyiin appears as a supporting character portrayed by Kwok Fung.

Three independent television series focused on the complex relationships between Zhao Kuangyin, Li Houzhu (Li Congjia) and the many women in their lives. They are:
* &quot;The Sword and the Song&quot; (), a 1986 Singaporean series starring Lin Mingzhe as Zhao Kuangyin and Li Wenhai as Li Congjia
* &quot;Love, Sword, Mountain &amp; River&quot; (), a 1996 Taiwanese series starring Wu Hsing-kuo as Zhao Kuangyin and Chin Feng as Li Congjia
* &quot;Li Houzhu and Zhao Kuangyin&quot; (), a 2006 Chinese series starring Huang Wen-hao as Zhao Kuangyin and Nicky Wu as Li Congjia

<text>Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. (MSLO) is an American diversified media and merchandising company founded by Martha Stewart in 1997 and owned by Marquee Brands LLC since April 2019. It is organized into four business segments: publishing, Internet, broadcasting media platforms, and merchandising product lines. MSLO&#x27;s business holdings include a variety of print publications, television and radio programming, and e-commerce websites.

==History==
The company was founded in 1997 by Martha Stewart as an umbrella company for the various media and merchandising ventures linked to the Martha Stewart brand. It went public, via an initial public offering, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on October 19, 1999. The stock opened at US$18 a share, but shot up to $38 a share, making Stewart an instant billionaire.

On August 6, 2002, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the company for misleading investors by issuing materially false and misleading statements, and its officers using insider information to avoid losses. A settlement of $30 million was approved in 2007.

In 2004, the company previously recognized as expense its estimate of annual subscription-acquisition costs rateably throughout the year. After reviewing this matter with its independent certified public accounting firm and its audit committee, the company determined on October 26, 2004, to change the method of accounting for interim period expense recognition of its subscription acquisition costs. The company recognized subscription-acquisition costs in the period in which the acquisition efforts took place and restated the financial statements.

On February 19, 2008, the company announced that it had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock. With the exclusion of Lagasse&#x27;s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consisted of the rights to television programs such as &quot;Essence of Emeril&quot; and &quot;Emeril Live&quot;, Emeril Lagasse&#x27;s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.

Stewart had served as president, chairwoman and chief executive officer of the company until being forced to resign as a result of the 2001 ImClone insider trading case. As part of an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, she was banned from serving in any role that would allow her to prepare, audit or disclose financial results of a public company until August 2011. In effect, this banned her from serving as an officer of her own company.

Stewart rejoined the board of directors of her namesake company in September 2011 and became its chairwoman once again in May 2012.

In 2012, Macy&#x27;s sued MSLO and J.C. Penney after the two companies decided, in 2011, to partner up and open up what would be called &quot;Martha Stewart Home Shops&quot;. Macy&#x27;s sued MSLO for &quot;breach of contract&quot; and sued J.C. Penney for &quot;interfering with its agreement with Martha Stewart&quot;. Both of these lawsuits were combined in December 2013. Macy&#x27;s goal was to stop J.C. Penney from selling MSLO merchandise that was supposed to be sold exclusively at Macy&#x27;s. Macy&#x27;s settled a portion of its lawsuit with MSLO over a home-products deal, however, Macy&#x27;s continues to sue J.C. Penney. MSLO did not disclose the terms of the settlement. This lawsuit cost between &quot;$7 million and $8 million in legal costs&quot;, according to MSLO&#x27;s chief executive officer Daniel Dienst.

The Omnimedia media division stopped printing &quot;Everyday Food&quot; and &quot;Whole Living&quot; magazines while the &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; magazine moved from monthly to eleven issues per year in 2013.

On December 4, 2015, it was announced that Sequential Brands Group acquired MSLO. As a result of its acquisition, MSLO requested that the NYSE suspend trading and de-list the company&#x27;s common stock.

In March 2017, MSLO partnered with Marley Spoon Inc. to have Martha &amp; Marley Spoon meal kit service delivered by Amazon Fresh to customers in Dallas, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., metropolitan areas.

Sequential Brands Group agreed in April 2019 to sell MSLO, including the Emeril brand, to Marquee Brands holding company for $175 million with benchmarked additional payments. The lease on MSLO&#x27;s headquarters in the Starrett-Lehigh Building in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan was not included in the deal, but Marquee could assume the lease. Marquee Brands owns various companies, including the BCBG Max Azria brand, and is a subsidiary of asset manager Neuberger Berman.

==Publishing==
The company has published various magazines, including:
* &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; (final print issue May 2022)
* &quot;Martha Stewart Weddings&quot; 
** special issues including the annual &quot;Holiday Cookies&quot;
* &quot;&quot; (canceled)
* &quot;Martha Stewart Kids&quot; (canceled)
* &quot;Martha Stewart Baby&quot; (canceled)
* &quot;Everyday Food&quot; (canceled 2013)
* &quot;Whole Living&quot; (canceled 2013)

Four newspaper columns — &quot;Ask Martha&quot;, &quot;Living&quot;, &quot;Weddings&quot; and &quot;Everyday Food&quot; — are distributed to newspapers throughout the U.S. via The New York Times Syndicate.

Current books are published through Random House&#x27;s Clarkson Potter division; earlier titles were offered through subsidiaries of Time Warner prior to Stewart&#x27;s spin-off of her business ventures from its corporate umbrella.

==Television and radio==

===Television===
On 15 November 2005, MSLO named NBC&#x27;s Sheraton Kalouria as president of television for MSLO. He was responsible for development and production of global programming for cable, broadcast, syndication and DVD as well as managing MSLO&#x27;s development in the area of digital content for video on demand, web and mobile platforms.

*&quot;Martha&quot; (syndicated, daily)
*&quot;Everyday Food&quot; (PBS, weekly)
*&quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot;
*&quot;From Martha&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;

Although MSLO retained no technical ownership stake in NBC&#x27;s program &quot;The Apprentice: Martha Stewart&quot;, the company, its magazines, and various business ventures were prominently featured in each episode. Mark Burnett, who produced the series, is also co-producer of the company&#x27;s daily talk show, &quot;Martha&quot;.

===DVD===

MSLO began marketing instructional DVDs in late 2005 through a partnership with Warner Bros., with the first five offerings oriented toward cooking and holiday and special-event planning.

===Radio===

MSLO operated a satellite radio channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio, on Channel 110 of SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Among programs on the channel there was a weekday-evening talk show co-hosted by Martha Stewart&#x27;s daughter Alexis Stewart, &quot;Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer&quot;. Alexis left the radio show in June 2011 leaving Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt as the sole host. The show was cancelled in December 2011 and Koppelman-Hutt was terminated.

==Internet and direct commerce==
The company&#x27;s Internet and Direct Commerce segment includes its website marthastewart.com and a direct-to-consumer flower business, marthastewartflowers.com.

Through an agreement with Touchpoint, it designed a line of customizable greeting cards under the Marthascards banner, which were sourced and fulfilled by Touchpoint. This agreement was replaced by a new program with Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2006.

In November 2006, MSLO announced its launch of Martha&#x27;s Circle which is a lifestyle-oriented blog-advertising network whose charter members included Apartment Therapy, Smitten Kitchen, and Charles &amp; Hudson.

Historically, the company also produced a print and online catalog, &quot;Martha by Mail&quot;, which was launched in 1997 and later rebranded as &quot;Martha Stewart: The Catalog for Living&quot;. Following Stewart&#x27;s public fallout and the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, the company decided to discontinue both the online and print editions in 2003. The final print catalog was mailed in January 2004, and the online store closed in June of that year.

==Merchandising==

MSLO additionally offers various home goods through its mass-market Martha Stewart Everyday brand in Kmart stores throughout the United States, and at Sears Canada in Canada. Furniture and paint are part of the company&#x27;s specialty-retail-oriented Martha Stewart Signature brand through a partnership with Bernhardt Furniture Company and previously with Sherwin-Williams.

In October 2006, the company announced a new agreement with Lowe&#x27;s to develop an exclusive interior paints line, which replaced its previous contract with Sherwin-Williams. The new line of paints, &quot;Martha Stewart Colors&quot;, launched in April 2007.

In April 2006, the company announced its plans to develop a new, upmarket merchandise line with Macy&#x27;s, Inc. (at the time named Federated Department Stores) launched in Macy&#x27;s stores in 2007.

The company also announced its intention to design a new paper-based crafts product line, Martha Stewart Crafts, with EK Success, initially planned for release in time for the Holiday
2006 season, which later debuted in early 2007 at Michael&#x27;s stores.

In the fall of 2009, MSLO announced the development of a line of outdoor furniture, indoor organization, kitchen cabinets, and decor products at Home Depot.

On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company&#x27;s stock. JCPenney planned to put &quot;mini-Martha Stewart shops&quot; in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.

=== Wine ===

On September 14, 2007, MSLO announced that it had agreed to a partnership with E &amp; J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with the label &quot;Martha Stewart Vintage&quot; for sale in six cities. The 15,000 cases to be sold included: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon).

MSLO also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO&#x27;s library of recipes.

<text>Marion Oliver McCaw Hall (often abbreviated to McCaw Hall) is a performing arts hall in Seattle, Washington. Located on the grounds of the Seattle Center and owned by the city of Seattle, McCaw Hall&#x27;s two principal tenants are Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet. The building is named for Marion Oliver McCaw, whose four sons donated $20 million to fund a major renovation in 2003. It was formerly known as the Civic Auditorium and Seattle Opera House.

==History==

The building originally opened in 1928 as the Civic Auditorium. Its construction was funded by a donation from Seattle saloon owner James Osborne and a voter-approved municipal bond issue; the site was donated to the city by David Denny, one of the members of the Denny Party credited with founding the city of Seattle. The auditorium became the home of the Seattle Symphony and also hosted several touring shows. In 1956, voters passed another bond measure to fund expansion of the Civic Auditorium for use as a venue in the upcoming World&#x27;s Fair. Construction began in 1959, and the auditorium reopened as the Seattle Opera House on April 21, 1962 – the opening day of the World&#x27;s Fair – with a Seattle Symphony performance featuring Igor Stravinsky as a guest conductor and Van Cliburn as a guest soloist.

The Opera House hosted several performances during the World&#x27;s Fair, including live telecasts of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, a science fiction panel discussion featuring Ray Bradbury and Rod Serling, as well as multiple concerts and dance performances featuring acts from around the world. The Seattle Opera company was founded in 1963 and held its first season in the Opera House in 1964. Pacific Northwest Ballet was founded in 1972 and held its first season in the Opera House in 1973. Seattle Symphony held its final concert in the Opera House on June 30, 1998, and moved to the newly completed Benaroya Hall soon after.

In 1999, voters passed a bond measure to fund another major renovation to the Opera House. The &quot;most dramatic&quot; renovation and expansion of the Opera House began in 2002. Cell phone pioneer Craig McCaw along with his three brothers donated $20 million to help fund construction and as a result the newly renovated building was named Marion Oliver McCaw Hall, after their mother. LMN Architects oversaw the renovation and McCaw Hall opened in late June 2003. The first concert at the renovated venue took place on September 29, 2003.

<doc id="1071533" wikidata="Q2991331" url="?curid=1071533" title="Missisquoi County, Quebec">
<text>Missisquoi County () is a historical county in Quebec. It was formed between 1825 and 1831 and included historical Bedford County, Lower Canada. In the early 1980s Quebec abolished its counties. Much of Missisquoi County became the Brome-Missisquoi Regional County Municipality except the southwestern part was transferred to Le Haut-Richelieu Regional County Municipality.

The name of the county is derived from an Algonquin Abenaki language word meaning &quot;lots of waterfowl&quot;.

Missisquoi County, part of the Eastern Townships (one of roughly 12 regions in Québec), is located on the western fringes of the Appalachian foothills, giving it a rolling landscape on its eastern part. The western part of the county is situated on the Richelieu River plains.

Missisquoi County is bound entirely on the south for 51 km by the Canada–US border (45° N) from 72°40.5′ W to the middle of the Richelieu River (73°20.8′ W), to the east by Brome County for 23 km along the meridian defined by 72°40.5′ W, to the northeast by Brome County and the northwest by Rouville County, and to the west by Iberville County and the Richelieu River (Saint-Jean County is on the other side of the river). The northernmost point of the county is at 45°21′ N and 73° W and is also the junction of the borders of Missisquoi County, Rouville County and Iberville County. The westernmost point of the county is on the Richelieu River at the Canada–US border at 45° N and 73°20′ W.

The county is divided into four townships, and there are two discontinuous zones along its western fringes without any township designation divided under the pre-1760 French parochial framework. The townships are the Township of Farnham in the north, Township of Dunham in the east and Township of Stanbridge to the west, and Township of Saint Armand along the Canada–US border. The county seat is the Town of Bedford located at 45°7′ N and 72°59′ W in the southwestern part of the Township of Stanbridge. Other major towns in the county are Farnham in the township of the same name and Cowansville in the northeastern corner of Dunham Township.

<doc id="1071538" wikidata="Q3487430" url="?curid=1071538" title="The Return of the Archons">
<text>&quot;The Return of the Archons&quot; is the twenty-first episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Boris Sobelman (based on a story by Gene Roddenberry), and directed by Joseph Pevney, it first aired on February 9, 1967.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; visit a seemingly peaceful planet whose inhabitants are &quot;of the Body&quot;, controlled by an unseen ruler, and enjoy a night of violence during &quot;Festival&quot;.

The episode contains &quot;Star Trek&quot; first reference to the Prime Directive.

==Plot==
The , under the command of Captain Kirk, arrives at the planet Beta III in the C-111 system where the USS &quot;Archon&quot; was reported lost nearly 100 years earlier. Lt. Sulu is the only member of the landing party who beams up from the planet&#x27;s surface, and exhibits inexplicable euphoria, as well as insisting the crew &quot;is not of the Body&quot; and referring to them as &quot;Archons&quot;. Kirk beams down with another party to investigate. They find the inhabitants living in a 19th-century Earth-style culture, ruled over by cloaked and cowled &quot;Lawgivers&quot; and a reclusive dictator, Landru. Their arrival is shortly followed by the &quot;Festival&quot;, a period of violence, destruction, and sexual aggression.

Kirk&#x27;s landing party seeks shelter from the mob at a boarding house owned by Reger. A friend of Reger&#x27;s suspects that the visitors are &quot;not of the Body&quot; (the whole of Betan society), and summons Lawgivers. When the landing party refuses to come with the Lawgivers, the Lawgivers become immobile. Reger leads the &quot;Enterprise&quot; landing team to a hiding place. En route, a telepathic command causes the townspeople to attack the landing party. They stun the attackers with their phasers, and find Lt. O&#x27;Neil, the other member of the original landing party, among them. They take O&#x27;Neil with them, but keep him sedated on Reger&#x27;s advice. Reger reveals that Landru &quot;pulled the Archons down from the skies&quot;. Contacting the ship, Kirk learns that heat beams from the planet are attacking the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which must use all its power for its shields. Its orbit is deteriorating and it will crash in 12 hours unless the beams are turned off.

A projection of Landru appears in the hiding place, and Kirk and his team are rendered unconscious by hypersonic waves. The landing party is imprisoned in a dungeon. Dr. Leonard McCoy is &quot;absorbed into the Body&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, placed under Landru&#x27;s mental control, but Marplon, a member of the underground against Landru, rescues Kirk and Spock. Reger and Marplon tell how Landru saved their society from war and anarchy 6,000 years ago and reduced the planet&#x27;s technology to a simpler level.

Overhearing their whispered plans, McCoy summons the Lawgivers. Kirk and Spock subdue them and don their robes. Marplon takes Kirk and Spock to the Hall of Audiences, where priests commune with Landru. A projection of Landru appears and threatens them. Kirk and Spock use their phasers to blast through the wall and expose a computer programmed by Landru, who died 6,000 years ago. The computer neutralizes their phasers. Kirk and Spock argue with the computer, that because it has destroyed the creativity of the people by disallowing their free will, it is evil and should self-destruct, freeing the people of Beta III. The computer suffers &#x27;a mental breakdown&#x27; and complies.

The heat beams stop, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is saved. Kirk agrees to leave Federation advisors and educators on the planet to help reform the civilization.

==Production==
&quot;The Return of the Archons&quot; was the first appearance in &quot;Star Trek&quot; for actor Charles Macaulay. He later appeared as Jaris, ruler of Argelius II, in the second-season episode &quot;Wolf in the Fold&quot;. This was actor Jon Lormer&#x27;s second appearance on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He had previously appeared as Dr. Theodore Haskins in the episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot; and made a third appearance as an unnamed old man in the third-season episode &quot;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot;. David L. Ross made his third appearance on &quot;Star Trek&quot; in this episode, after having appeared as a security guard in the episodes &quot;Miri&quot; and as a transporter chief in &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot; earlier in the first season. He received his first speaking role as Lieutenant Johnson in the second season episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, and appeared in another speaking role as Lt. Galloway in the second season episode &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;. Character actor Sid Haig has a role as one of the hooded Lawgivers who first confront the landing party in Reger&#x27;s boarding house.

&quot;The Return of the Archons&quot; introduces for the first time the Federation&#x27;s Prime Directive. However, an important modification is made to the absolutist non-interference rule almost immediately. Kirk argues that the Prime Directive does not bar interference with other cultures, but rather bars interference only with a &quot;living and growing&quot; culture. Scholar Eric Greene argues this is reflective of the &quot;frontier myth&quot; of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and American foreign policy in the late 20th century, in which a superior culture expands to impose its understanding of freedom and progress on others. M. Keith Booker, interpreting the politics of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, agrees, noting that in leaving behind a sociological team to &quot;help restore the planet&#x27;s culture to a more human form&quot; means restoring it to one that &quot;suits the values of the Federation and twenty-third century Earth.&quot; Indeed, the Prime Directive would only truly be honored during the series in the episode &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;.

Location shooting for &quot;Return of the Archons&quot; occurred on the 40 Acres backlot in Culver City, California. The street scenes were part of the &quot;Town of Atlanta&quot;, a set which consists of a mid-1800s city street, a town square, and a residential area (originally constructed for the motion picture &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1939). The dungeon set was first constructed for this episode, and reused in the first-season episode &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot;. Marplon&#x27;s absorption booth console was also reused several times in the series. It reappeared (with modifications) as a relay station in the second-season episode &quot;I, Mudd&quot;, as a Federation outpost control panel in the third-season episode &quot;The Lights of Zetar&quot;, the housing for the Romulan cloaking device in the third-season episode &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot;, and as the force field control station at the penal colony Elba II in the third-season episode &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;. The computer that ruled Beta III was seen again (slightly modified) in the first-season episode &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;. The doors to the Hall of Audiences were a re-use of doors previously seen in the episode &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot; and were reused in &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;.

The episode contains two errors. When the &quot;Festival&quot; breaks out, the mob begins hurling stones at the landing party. A large &quot;rock&quot; made of papier-mâché accidentally hits one of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; security personnel in the head. The actor stayed in character and kept running to ensure that the take was not ruined. When the landing party rests in a bedroom at Reger&#x27;s boarding house, the windows are blacked out in all wide shots, but clearly transparent and showing the street outside in all close-ups.

==Reception==
Eric Greene observes that &quot;Return of the Archons&quot; is the first time &quot;Star Trek&quot; attempted to deal with issues of war and peace raised by the Vietnam War, and established a template that was used in a number of subsequent episodes such as &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, and &quot;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot;. The Federation&#x27;s moral superiority is exhibited through its emphasis on individual freedom, progress, and resort to violence only in self-defense, while the Betan society is criticized for its state control, stagnation, and reliance on aggression. Greene argues that these episodes prefigure the Borg Collective, a far more overt totalitarian (even Soviet) metaphor introduced in the series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Scholar M. Keith Booker notes that the episode presents Kirk &quot;at his most American&quot;, valuing struggle against obstacles as the highest virtue and denouncing the Betan utopia (equated with Stalinism) as dehumanizing.

Scholars Michael A. Burstein and John Kenneth Muir note that the plot of &quot;The Return of the Archons&quot; (in which Kirk and company discover a stagnant society worshiping a god-like being whom Kirk destroys with human illogic) became something of a cliché in the decades after the series ended. Burstein criticizes the episode for attacking organized religion, which it presented as suppressing freedom and creativity. But religious scholar Michael Anthony Corey praises the episode for realizing that the elimination of a huge number of moral evils can occur only by causing a single, massive moral evil (the loss of free will). Corey points out that the episode seems to draw heavily on German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;Principle of Radical Optimism&quot;, which concludes that ours is the best of all possible worlds because it contains the conditions for human existence (and not because it has a greater or lesser number of moral evils).

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &quot;B&quot; rating, describing the episode as having a &quot;loose, unpolished feeling&quot; and lacking &quot;the force of the series&#x27; best story lines&quot;, but praised the story&#x27;s ambition.

&quot;Return of the Archons&quot; is one of actor Ben Stiller&#x27;s favorite episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. &quot;Red Hour&quot;, the time of day when the &quot;Festival&quot; begins, is the name of his production company.

This was noted as one of the episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; that does not have a traditional villain, and noted that computers gone wrong as a villain might be expected in a technologically advanced culture as depicted by &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
The &quot;Festival&quot; in this episode served as the inspiration behind the 2013 film &quot;The Purge&quot;, and the subsequent media franchise it spawned.

<text>Gonzalo Torrente Ballester (13 June 1910 – 27 January 1999) was a Spanish writer associated with the Generation of &#x27;36 movement. 

==Life==
He was born in Serantes, Ferrol, Galicia, and received his first education there, subsequently attending the universities of Santiago de Compostela and Oviedo.

Although primarily a novelist, he also published journalism, essays, and plays. His career as a writer began in Oviedo, but developed largely in Madrid.

Before the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, he traveled to Paris with the intention of writing his doctoral thesis and there he was surprised by the coup d&#x27;etat of July 18, 1936. After hesitating, he returned to Spain in October to be with his family. From the bus that was taking him home, he saw the bodies of victims of the repression in the ditches. His father exclaimed by way of greeting: &quot;Don&#x27;t you know that many of your friends have been shot?&quot;. He followed the recommendation of a priest he trusted and joined the Falange. His first novel, &quot;Javier Mariño&quot;, appeared in 1943, and he continued to publish novels almost until his death, receiving major prizes for some of them.

Despite his affiliation to the Falangists, from 1939, when he returned to Santiago to take up a university post, he increasingly distanced himself from the party. He joined in protests in favour of striking Asturian miners in 1962, and was expelled from his teaching post at the university as a result. In the mid-1960s he had a number of problems with government censors.

He left Spain for a post at the University at Albany, State University of New York in 1966, and remained there until 1973 as the university&#x27;s first distinguished professor. In 1975 he moved to the city of Salamanca, where he remained until his death. After his return to Spain, he was increasingly celebrated: he was elected to seat &quot;E&quot; of the Real Academia Española, which he took up on 27 May 1977, and was awarded the premier Spanish literary prize, the Cervantes Prize, in 1985.

Immediately after his death, the Fundación Gonzalo Torrente Ballester was set up to protect, study and disseminate his work.

<doc id="1071548" wikidata="Q3772556" url="?curid=1071548" title="Natsume Atari">
<text>, formerly from 1987 to 2013, is a Japanese video game developer and publisher. Natsume Atari is based in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan and is known for developing licensed titles and mobile games.

The company was founded as Natsume Co., Ltd. in 1987. In 1995, its American division Natsume Inc. split to become an independent company. The name &quot;Natsume&quot; was retained by both companies in their respective countries. In 2013, Natsume Co., Ltd. renamed itself Natsume Atari following a merger with its subsidiary Atari Inc. (a pachinko company, not to be confused with the American game company) that year. Since 2016, Natsume Atari&#x27;s division Tengo Project has developed modern remakes to classic video games.

==Products==
During the NES and SNES era, Natsume Atari developed numerous titles, often licensed, such as &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. Natsume Inc published a wide range of titles, including those developed by Natsume Co. Ltd., such as &quot;S.C.A.T.&quot;, &quot;Wild Guns&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Ninja&quot;. Natsume Atari also released the SNES game &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; as well as &quot;Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals&quot;. Natsume Atari had also developed the Medarot games up until the end of the GBA era, and Natsume Inc. published some of them outside of Japan.

A sizeable amount of Natsume Atari&#x27;s products were video games it developed for other publishers. Some of its biggest clients over the years included Imagineer, Bandai, THQ and Taito. Most of Natsume Atari&#x27;s video games, as a sub-contractor, were original titles, but it occasionally developed some ports as well. Taito, in particular, outsourced the development of three of its Master System ports to Natsume Co., Ltd.: &quot;Sagaia&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;Special Criminal Investigation&quot;.

==Corporate divisions==
Natsume Co., Ltd. was founded in Japan on October 20, 1987. It became the parent company of Natsume Inc., founded in May 1988. Natsume Inc. started publishing video games in 1990. By 1995, Natsume Inc. had broken away into its own company and is separately owned and operated.

In October 2002, Natsume Co., Ltd. founded the pachinko company Atari Inc. (not to be confused with the American game company) in Osaka, which specialized in developing slot and pinball machines. On May 6, 2005, Natsume Solution began operation in Shinjuku. This division specializes on web site development, providing mobile solutions/services and developing web systems. On March 1, 2006, Natsume Solution was merged with Evolve.

Natsume Co., Ltd. changed its name to Natsume Atari in October 2013, and it is not directly connected to Natsume Inc. or its subsidiary Natsume Inc. Japan. Despite their corporate split off, Natsume Atari and Natsume Inc. have continued to collaborate on a number of occasions.

Within Natsume Atari exists Tengo Project, an internal development team established as early as 2008 for the production of &quot;Omega Five&quot;, which has shifted its focus to modern revivals of classic video games. Composed of veteran developers with an average age of 54 (as of 2022), its permanent members are composer Hiroyuki Iwatsuki, designer Shunichi Taniguchi, and programmer Toshiyasu Miyabe. Its works include &quot;Wild Guns Reloaded&quot;, &quot;The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors&quot; and &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined&quot;.

==Works==

===Pre-split Natsume===
These are games produced while Natsume Inc., was still operating as a subsidiary of Natsume Co., Ltd. Natsume Inc. would publish only Natsume Co., Ltd.&#x27;s games until becoming independent in the mid-90s.

===Natsume Atari / Natsume Co., Ltd.===
Natsume Atari, formerly Natsume Co., Ltd, has mostly acted as a developer since splitting from Natsume Inc. - although it has also published some games, notably in the &quot;Medarot&quot; series.

<doc id="1071555" wikidata="Q7017243" url="?curid=1071555" title="Newbury Street">
<text>Newbury Street is located in the Back Bay area of Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States. It runs roughly east–west, from the Boston Public Garden to Brookline Avenue. The road crosses several major arteries along its path, with an entrance to the Massachusetts Turnpike westbound at Massachusetts Avenue. Newbury Street is known for its retail shops and restaurants.

==Description==
East of Massachusetts Avenue, Newbury Street is a mile-long street lined with historic 19th-century brownstones that contain hundreds of shops and restaurants, making it a popular destination for tourists and locals. Most of the &quot;high-end boutiques&quot; are located near the Boston Public Garden end of Newbury Street. As the address numbers climb, the shops become slightly less expensive and more bohemian up to Massachusetts Avenue.

West of Massachusetts Avenue, the street borders the Massachusetts Turnpike on its unbuilt southern side, while the northern side is reserved mainly for parking and rear service entrances for buildings on Commonwealth Avenue. Newbury Street is interrupted by the Muddy River and Charlesgate Park. It then continues to border the Turnpike on its southern side until it meets Brookline Avenue. The shopping district might be able to expand as a result of a major project that is being considered for decking over the Turnpike to the west of Massachusetts Avenue.

Newbury Street has a mix of shops and eateries. Its renovated brownstone buildings feature coffee shops, cafes, and restaurants, with stores at all retail levels. However, due to the concentration of upscale luxury stores at its easternmost end, it is known as one of the most expensive streets in the world.

Donlyn Lyndon, the Eva Li Professor Emeritus of Architecture and Urban Design at the University of California, Berkeley, writes that west of Clarendon Street

Since 2000, the City of Boston has experimented with closing Newbury Street between Berkeley Street and Massachusetts Avenue to vehicular traffic on Sundays during the summer. This &quot;Open Newbury Street&quot; program was extended by the addition of two December weekends .

==History==
===Early history===


Newbury Street&#x27;s name celebrates the victory of the Puritans in the 1643 Battle of Newbury in the English Civil War. Newbury Street was one of the earliest roads in Boston, its portion was renamed Washington Street by the end of the 18th century. The current road was created during the filling in of Back Bay in the mid-19th century.

The 1893 edition of &quot;Baedeker&#x27;s United States&quot; catalogs Boston&#x27;s &quot;finest residence streets&quot; as Commonwealth Avenue, Beacon Street, Marlborough Street, Newbury Street, and Mt. Vernon Street. William J. Geddis, however, notes that it was &quot;the least fashionable Street in Back Bay.&quot;

Owen Wister&#x27;s novel, &quot;Philosophy 4&quot;, set in the 1870s, mentions Newbury Street:

The first commercial establishments opened around 1905. By the late 1920s, lower Newbury Street had begun to establish itself as a destination for well-heeled society. With the establishment of Boston&#x27;s Junior League in 1907, formal dances became very fashionable, and elegant apparel shops prospered. By 1911, 24 Newbury St. featured a salon for lessons in &quot;social and aesthetic dance.&quot; As more retailers moved in, many lower floor shops began to feature wide glass windows to exhibit luxury goods. In the late 1950s, fashionable boutiques included Darée, Charles Sumner, Miss Harvey (at #32), furriers and Joseph Antell. One of Newbury&#x27;s oldest and most established retailers is the Brooks Brothers department store which occupies its original quarters at the corner of Berkeley St.

===Transformation into a shopping district===
The transformation that turned Newbury Street into a trendy shopping district probably began in the 1970s with the opening of the original Newbury Comics.

From 1970 until the late 1990s, lower Newbury Street was lined with posh up-and-coming art galleries. Newbury Street mavens and hipsters spent Saturday afternoons gallery hopping and enjoying the ubiquitous &quot;wine and cheese&quot; art openings.

The renowned music instrument retailer E.U. Wurlitzer Music and Sound was a part of the greater Boston music scene since 1890, and the store had been located at 360 Newbury Street (on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue) after moving from its LaGrange Street address in the mid-1960s. The building was a plain yellow-brick building by the time the company went out of business in the mid-1980s. In 1989, it was renovated under the direction of architect Frank Gehry and won the Parker Award as the most beautiful new building in Boston. According to architecture columnist Robert Campbell, Gehry &quot;took a blandly forgettable building and transformed it into a monument... It&#x27;s the first significant example in Boston of a movement known as deconstruction. Deconstructionist buildings are designed to look as if their parts are either colliding or exploding, usually at crazy angles.&quot;

===Recent history===
Since the turn of the 21st century, Newbury Street has maintained its transformative shopping experience alongside an evolving retail industry. Made-to-measure suits, eco-friendly products, guide shops and concept stores are offerings now commonly found in the area. The street has retained both its sophisticated architectural style and its eclectic mix of retailers, from luxury brands and high-end boutiques to innovative up-and-coming companies, cafés and restaurants. Stores such as Tiffany &amp; Co, Cartier, Valentino, rag &amp; bone, Jack Wills, Steven Alan, Zara, Urban Outfitters, Lady M, Uniqlo and Muji comprise the diverse retail landscape.

More recently, the district has become a popular destination for highly produced pop up shops. Many e-commerce brands use temporary storefronts on Newbury Street to test the Boston market for expansion, often landing as permanent fixtures on the street. Local and national celebrities such as Julian Edelman, Kanye West, Martellus Bennett, and Gretta Monahan have also created or contributed to pop up activations on Newbury Street.

==Notable places==
* The first building completed in Back Bay after it was filled in 1860 was Emmanuel Church at 15 Newbury Street. 
* At 234 Berkeley Street, between Newbury and Boylston Streets, is a notable building designed by William G. Preston in the classical French Beaux-Arts architecture style for the Boston Society of Natural History in 1864. Lyndon describes it as &quot;a remarkably serene Classical building with none of the latent boosterism of its near contemporary, Old City Hall.&quot; The museum was renamed the Museum of Science in 1945 and moved to Science Park. It was the site of a Bonwit Teller store from 1947 to 1989 and the men&#x27;s retailer Louis, Boston from 1990 to 2010. In March 2013, the extensively renovated building re-opened as a Restoration Hardware flagship store.
* Between 1865 and 1916, Newbury Street was the location of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its Boston campus grew to include two large academic buildings adjacent to the Natural History Museum, one of which was also designed by Preston. By the beginning of the 20th century, smaller scaled townhouses and social establishments filled in much of the length of street frontage. By 1939, MIT&#x27;s grand structures were demolished and replaced by an insurance building. Gentleman&#x27;s Clubs on Newbury Street included MIT&#x27;s Technology Club at #83 across from the original main campus.
* Boston Architectural College at 320 Newbury Street and 322 Newbury Street, the United States&#x27; oldest and largest private college of spatial design, made its home on Newbury Street in the early 1960s. A national design competition was held in 1964, and the winning entry (by Ashley, Myer &amp; Associates) houses the BAC to this day. The main campus building located at 320 Newbury Street is a large Brutalist building, a major example of this style in Back Bay. The college also owns 951/955 Boylston, which is connected to the fire station at 941 Boylston. The fire station is still active, housing Boston Fire Department Engine Company 33, and Ladder Company 15. The west elevation of the 320 Newbury building is articulated with a mural by the artist Richard Haas, which was completed in 1975. The &quot;trompe l&#x27;oeil&quot; full-scale cross-section of a Classical-style building and dome provides a contrast to the Brutalist style of the building. 
* On the corner of Exeter and Newbury Street—the address is given both as 181 Newbury Street and as 26 Exeter Street—is a striking building designed by Boston architects Hartwell and Richardson in the Romanesque Revival style. It was originally built in 1885 as the First Spiritual Temple, a Spiritualist church. In 1914 it became a movie theater, the Exeter Street Theatre. The movie theater was notable both for its ambiance (&quot;You felt like you were in some kind of Tudor manor or English country church&quot;) and programming (&quot;It was a theater where people did not call to see &quot;what&quot; movie was playing, but called only to determine if the movie had changed&quot;). Beginning in the mid-1970s, the theater&#x27;s midnight screenings of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; gave the movie a popular cult following, often attracting patrons dressed up in costumes based on characters in the film.
* After 70 years the Exeter Street Theatre closed in 1984, due to declining box-office revenues. Its illustrious interior was dismantled and transformed into a Conran&#x27;s furniture store. After the failure of Conran&#x27;s, it became a Waterstone&#x27;s bookstore, whose extensive inventory was ruined by massive flooding caused by sprinklers set off by a fire in the T.G.I. Friday&#x27;s restaurant downstairs. Since 2005 the Kingsley Montessori School has occupied the building, with offices on the upper floors and a restaurant at street level.
* In 2012, the chocolatier L.A. Burdick opened its fourth location on Newbury Street.
* In 2023, Newbury Street has witnessed the emergence of several noteworthy establishments, contributing to the street&#x27;s reputation as a hub of luxury and style. Notable among these recent additions are renowned stores including New Balance, Moscot, and Byredo.

<text>Broadmayne is a village in the English county of Dorset. It lies two miles south-east of the county town Dorchester. The A352 main road between Dorchester (from Sherborne) and Wareham passes through the village. In the 2001 Census the population of the village was 1,864, reducing to 1,204 at the 2011 Census. There is an electoral ward of the same name whose population at the above census was 1,870. Village facilities and services include a post office, a clinic (closed since 2014) and a public house (&quot;The Black Dog&quot;). There are two churches in the village, both of which were redesigned by Thomas Hardy, who was an architect before he became a novelist. The parish church of St Martin dates from the 13th century and has a notable south tower.

==History==
Broadmayne parish has a long history of human settlement. In the Domesday Book of 1086, one of two settlements named Maine in Culliford Tree Hundred was later called Friar Mayne to avoid confusion with another Maine (Parva Maene) sited at Little Mayne Farm in West Knighton parish. Between 1290 and 1338, a preceptory of the Knights Hospitaller was established at Friar Mayne. The preceptory declined in activity, then in 1533 began leasing its bailiwick to provide stipends for rectories, vicarages, and the larger preceptories in other locations.

The family estate of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the founder of the State of Maine in the northeast United States, was in Broadmayne; one theory is that the state was named after the village.

== Politics ==
After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Broadmayne is part of the Winterborne and Broadmayne ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

<doc id="1071574" wikidata="Q7239843" url="?curid=1071574" title="Preferred Roaming List">
<text>The Preferred Roaming List (PRL) is a database residing in a wireless (primarily CDMA) device, such as a cellphone, that contains information used during the system selection and acquisition process. In the case of -based CDMA devices, the PRL resides on the R-UIM. The PRL indicates which bands, sub bands, and service provider identifiers will be scanned and in what priority order. Without a PRL, the device may not be able to roam, i.e. obtain service outside of the home area. There may be cases where missing or corrupt PRLs can lead to a customer not having service at all.

On many networks, regularly updating the PRL is advised if the subscriber uses the device outside the home area frequently, particularly if they do so in multiple different areas. This allows the phone to choose the best roaming carriers, particularly &quot;roaming partners&quot; with whom the home carrier has a cost-saving roaming agreement, rather than using non-affiliated carriers. PRL files can also be used to identify home networks along with roaming partners, thus making the PRL an actual list that determines the total coverage of the subscriber, both home and roaming coverage.

The PRL is built by an operator and is normally not accessible to the user. Many operators provide the ability for the user to download the latest PRL to their device by dialing an Over-the-air (OTA) feature code. In the United States, for Verizon / MetroPCS / US Cellular, this feature code is *228 (*ACT). For Sprint, it is ##873283# (it is also possible to use code ##72786# on Android or ##25327# on iOS to completely clear out the service programming and redo OTA activation, which includes updating the PRL). In Canada, for Telus Mobility, the PRL update feature code is *22803 (*ACT03).

==PRL structure==
The PRL consists of two tables (along with some header and overhead information):
:*Acquisition Table – An indexed list of frequencies on which the device may search for particular systems. The idea behind the acquisition table is to optimize the acquisition time by identifying only the frequencies that should be searched, rather than searching the entire frequency spectrum. The information contained in each acquisition table entry includes an index, the network type, and associated channel blocks.
:*System Table – A prioritized list of systems that the device is permitted to access (Preferred Systems) and those that it is explicitly forbidden to access (Negative Systems). Note that it is also possible to indicate forbidden systems using a separate SID/NID Lockout List in the handset; however, this is not a recommended approach as it creates control over system selection outside of the PRL. 
::Each system table entry belongs to a geographic area known as a GEO. These GEOs are listed in priority order. Each IS-95/1xRTT system is identified by either SID/NID or, in the case of enhanced PRL, SID/NID or MCC/MNC. To support 1xEV-DO systems, the PRL must be IS-683-C or later. Each 1xEV-DO system is identified by a Subnet ID. For hybrid mode operation (i.e. IS-95/1xRTT and 1xEV-DO), association tags are used link an IS-95/1xRTT system with one or more 1xEV-DO systems. Hybrid systems always attempt to select an IS-95/1xRTT system first, then use the association tag to attempt to select an associated 1xEV-DO system.
::Each entry also provides an acquisition table index where the frequencies associated with that system are identified and a roaming indicator that dictates what type of indication should be displayed to the user when they are receiving service from that system.

==PRL modes of operation==

The PRL may operate in one of two modes, dictated by a Preferred Only indicator:
:*Permissive Mode (&quot;a.k.a. Open PRL, Not Preferred Mode&quot;) – The device will attempt to acquire preferred systems; however, if no preferred systems can be located, then the device may select systems that are not listed in the PRL system table. It still will not select negative systems; but, if no preferred systems can be found and an unknown system is available, then it will select the unknown system. While this mode of operation is easier to maintain, because new partners can be chosen even if they are not explicitly listed in the PRL, it carries with it the danger of allowing the mobile device to become camped onto a system that will not provide it with service.
:*Restrictive Mode (&quot;a.k.a. Closed PRL, Preferred Only Mode&quot;) – The device will only acquire systems identified as preferred in the PRL system table. While this mode of operation gives operators the most control over the system selection process, it requires that PRLs be kept up-to-date to ensure that newly added roaming partners can be selected. Note that even if a PRL is restrictive according to the preferred only indicator, the use of wildcard SID/NID or MCC/MNC values as preferred systems would essentially make the PRL permissive, because wildcards match any system that is located.

<text>Broadwindsor () is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in South West England. It lies west of Beaminster. Broadwindsor was formerly a liberty, containing only the parish itself. Dorset County Council estimate that in 2013 the population of the civil parish was 1,320. In the 2011 census the population of the parish, combined with that of the small parish of Seaborough to the north, was 1,378.

The parish church is principally Perpendicular in style, though it has origins in the 12th and 13th centuries, and was rebuilt in 1868. Thomas Fuller, who wrote &quot;The Worthies of England&quot; and &quot;The History of the Holy Warre&quot;, preached here between 1634 and 1650.

King Charles II stayed the night in the village on 23 September 1651, after his flight from the Battle of Worcester.

The settlement has a long history, with Paleolithic hand axes found to the west on Hursey Comman, a Bronze Age gold strip found just to the north of the village, a Roman fort, Waddon Hill, between Broadwindsor and Stoke Abbott, and a Roman hypocaust from the mid second century found between Broadwindsor and Little Windsor in about 1910.

The parish includes the village of Drimpton.

<text>An artpack is an archive of computer artwork which is distributed in a compressed format such as ZIP or RAR.

While most artpacks today contain either ANSI and ASCII art or &quot;hirez&quot; VGA, they may also include a combination of RIPscrip art, tracked or otherwise digital music, poetry and editorials, 3D computer animation and related software utilities.

The first artpack ever was &quot;The Acquisition&quot;, released by ACiD Productions in the early 1990s. Artpacks were originally released on a monthly basis by competing groups in the artscene, naming their files accordingly, i.e. . Very few groups still carry on the tradition of monthly releases in this day, rather they opt to numbering their artpacks in sequence rather than by date, i.e. , releasing their artpacks without any defined schedule.

In retrospect, artpacks are recognized as one of the primary reasons that the early computer art scene is so well preserved and documented in relation to other underground computer scenes at the time.

Granny Goose Foods, Inc. was founded in Oakland, California, by Matthew Barr in 1946. In 1993, the company acquired the Laura Scudder brand from Borden, Inc., but due to intense competition from PepsiCo&#x27;s Frito-Lay and Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Eagle Snacks could not make a profit, so the entire company was put up for sale in 1995.

In 2000, the company moved most of its operations from its corporate headquarters in Oakland to Kaysville, Utah. That same year, Snak King acquired Granny Goose&#x27;s corn chip, tortilla chip, popcorn, potato chip and extruded snack lines.

The Granny Goose potato chip line is produced by Shearer&#x27;s Foods under license from Snak King. Granny Goose products can be readily found in the Western United States.

In the Philippines, Granny Goose was known for its Tortillos and Kornets corn-based snacks manufactured by General Milling Corporation (GMC) under license from Granny Goose Foods Inc. since 1982. GMC would later acquire the trademark rights for the Philippines. In 2008, Universal Robina Corporation acquired the Granny Goose snack business of GMC.

==Mascot and advertising==
Its logo and mascot, also named Granny Goose, is an anthropomorphic cartoon goose. In a series of television commercials first aired in the 1960s, the company&#x27;s spokesperson, who self-identified as &quot;Granny Goose&quot;, was portrayed by actor Philip Carey as an ultra-masculine tough guy, depicted in the commercials as such manly stereotypes as a cowboy or a James Bond-style spy.

<doc id="1071601" wikidata="Q528912" url="?curid=1071601" title="Crowbar (American band)">
<text>Crowbar is an American sludge metal band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1990. The band is fronted by vocalist/guitarist Kirk Windstein, Crowbar&#x27;s sole constant member. 

Infusing a slow, brooding doom metal sound with the aggression of hardcore punk, Crowbar along with other bands in the New Orleans heavy metal scene pioneered a style known as sludge metal, though Windstein himself has admitted a dislike for the term. 

The band are also known for their covers of songs from outside of their immediate genre; these include Gary Wright&#x27;s &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; on &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; on &quot;Odd Fellows Rest&quot;, and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;No Quarter&quot; on &quot;Crowbar&quot;.

==History==
===Origins (1988–1991)===
The band dates back to 1988, when Kirk Windstein joined the New Orleans hardcore punk band ShellShock. He met Jimmy Bower, who was their drummer, and they quickly became friends. The band collapsed when Mike Hatch, their guitarist, committed suicide in late 1988. The band hence replaced Hatch with Kevin Noonan and continued under the new name, Aftershock. Under that name they released a demo in mid-1989 and then renamed themselves again as Wrequiem, with their bassist Mike Savoie leaving the band and Todd Strange replacing him. They renamed themselves yet again in 1990 as The Slugs, and released a demo in mid-1990, but the band collapsed.

Windstein considered becoming the bass player for New Orleans–based groove metal band Exhorder but he and Strange reformed their band, with Craig Nunenmacher as the drummer. Nunenmacher was later replaced by Tommy Buckley from Soilent Green, and Kevin Noonan returned on guitar. The band renamed themselves Crowbar in mid-1991, after their label warned them that another band called &quot;The Slugs&quot; already existed; the name Crowbar was borrowed from one of Windstein&#x27;s side-projects. Windstein has listed Celtic Frost as one of the band&#x27;s early influences in terms of sound.

===Career (1991–present)===

Crowbar&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Obedience thru Suffering&quot;, was released in 1991, but failed to achieve significant sales or airplay. By 1993&#x27;s self-titled album, personal friend Phil Anselmo (Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual) produced the record, which eventually led to national promotion on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. In addition, the videos for &quot;All I Had (I Gave)&quot; and &quot;Existence Is Punishment&quot; were commented on by &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. Following this success, the band went on to record music videos, embark on major tours with Pantera, and record more albums.

Their stage antics, immortalized in Pantera&#x27;s third home video and Crowbar&#x27;s &quot;Like Broken Glass&quot; home video, became infamous. The band continued recording and touring. In 1994, the Pantera video for the song &quot;I&#x27;m Broken&quot; showed Anselmo wearing a Crowbar/Eyehategod T-shirt. Original drummer Nunenmacher left the band in 1996 and was replaced by Jimmy Bower from Down and Eyehategod, and for their 1996 release, Anselmo sang backup on a few tracks on &quot;Broken Glass&quot;.

In 2000, after recording and releasing &quot;Equilibrium&quot; with Sid Montz on drums, Nunenmacher rejoined the band for the &quot;Penchant for Violence Tour&quot; with &quot;The Brotherhood of Brewtality&quot; Black Label Society and Sixty Watt Shaman. Halfway through the tour, Nunenmacher replaced BLS&#x27;s drummer Phil Ondich and pulled double duty for the rest of the tour, eventually joining BLS permanently.

The band continues to perform, borrowing members from New Orleans metal bands like Goatwhore and Acid Bath. In their 2005 release, &quot;Lifesblood for the Downtrodden&quot;, Pantera bassist Rex Brown lent his bass skills and keyboard playing. Down&#x27;s producer Warren Riker assisted in production. Also in 2005, Beavis and Butt-Head&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Existence Is Punishment&quot; appeared on the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head: The Mike Judge Collection&quot; No. 3 DVD.

The band is also known for covering other bands&#x27; material and putting a heavy spin on it. Crowbar covered Gary Wright&#x27;s &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; on their &quot;Equilibrium&quot; album, Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; on &quot;Odd Fellows Rest&quot;, and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;No Quarter&quot; on &quot;Crowbar&quot;.

On April 21, 2008, the albums &quot;Crowbar&quot;, &quot;Time Heals Nothing&quot;, and the &quot;Live+1&quot; EP were reissued in Europe with bonus and multimedia tracks. On May 24, 2009, it was announced that Phil Anselmo&#x27;s Housecore Records would be re-releasing Crowbar&#x27;s back catalog.

In December 2009, Crowbar toured with Hatebreed, The Acacia Strain, The Casualties, and Thy Will Be Done as part of the Stillborn Fest.

As of September 2010, Crowbar is under contract with E1 Music in North America and Century Media in Europe, and released their ninth studio album, &quot;Sever the Wicked Hand&quot;, on February 8, 2011. This date is the sixth anniversary of the release of their previous album, &quot;Lifesblood for the Downtrodden&quot;. The band embarked on a six-date UK tour in January 2011.

Bassist Pat Bruders left Crowbar in September 2013. Bruders explained he wanted to focus on touring with Down. He told &quot;Louder than Hell&quot;, &quot;It is better for all parties in Crowbar and in Down that I leave Crowbar. With Down&#x27;s brutal tour schedule and overseas shows. It is better if I focus 100 percent of my time to Down. There are no hard feelings with my bandmates of Crowbar.&quot; Bruders was replaced by Jeff Golden, who formerly played with Six Feet Under, Thy Will Be Done, and Goatwhore.

Crowbar entered the studio in late 2013 to begin recording &quot;Symmetry in Black&quot;, which was released in North America on May 27, 2014, via E1 Music.

In May 2016, bassist Jeff Golden announced on his Facebook page that he had been fired from the band.
Shortly after Golden&#x27;s departure, Windstein announced that founding bassist Todd Strange would return to the band. In July 2018, Strange had retired from touring although he will remain a member of the band. His final performance was at the &quot;Odd Fellows Rest&quot; 20th anniversary show on August 4, 2018. Shane Wesley is his live replacement and had already played on Crowbar&#x27;s summer European tour.

In mid 2017, Crowbar supported Overkill on the annual Metal Alliance tour. In the spring of 2018, Crowbar opened up for Hatebreed on their &quot;20 Years of Desire&quot; and &quot;15 Years of Perseverance&quot; tours. Crowbar opened up for Killswitch Engage on a short fall tour in November 2018.

Crowbar&#x27;s twelfth studio album (and their first in six years) &quot;Zero and Below&quot; was released on March 4, 2022. The band toured North America and Europe with Sepultura and Sacred Reich in support of the album.

==Style==
Crowbar&#x27;s music has been described as sludge metal. According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, Crowbar &quot;combines the doomy heft of Black Sabbath, the intense riffage of Pantera, and the intricate progressions of Metallica&quot;. According to author J. J. Anselmi, Crowbar&#x27;s sound has evolved from &quot;unadultered aggression to [embracing] haunting quietude&quot;. Crowbar&#x27;s early material is said to have &quot;[slowed] down caveman hardcore to a knuckled crawl&quot;, while their later output has been said to have &quot;illustrated a penchant for dynamic eeriness, intermixing brutish heaviness with foreboding ether&quot;.

They have cited influences including Melvins, Black Sabbath, Carnivore, Witchfinder General, Saint Vitus, and Trouble.

<text>The Westinghouse AN/ASQ-153\AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike is an electro-optical laser designator targeting pod used to direct laser-guided bombs (LGBs) to target in daylight, visual conditions. It contained a laser boresighted to a television camera, which displayed its image on a cockpit screen.

==Development==
Pave Spike was developed to replace the earlier Pave Knife laser designator used by USAF F-4D/E Phantom II which was bulky, slowing the F-4 and restricting maneuverability while occupying one of the weapons pylons on the F-4. Pave Spike was much smaller, the 144-inch-long (3.66 m), 420-lb (209 kg) pod was designed for carriage on the left, forward AIM-7 Sparrow missile station of the F-4. Because it was smaller and nestled into the semi-submerged AIM-7 station, it did not restrict F-4 speed or maneuverability, nor did it occupy a precious weapons pylon. The F-4 still had three AIM-7 stations in which it could carry the usual radar-guided missiles. Pave Spike, like Pave Knife, had a clear dome nose through which a television camera viewed the target area, and through which the laser could fire to designate the target. The entire nose assembly gimbaled to look throughout the hemisphere below the jet.

By 1976 the F–4 Fighter Weapons School squadron, the 414th Fighter Weapons Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, was flying its F-4E fighters with the new Pave Spike pod and learning how to employ the system throughout its performance envelope. The pod was on the leading edge of technology for the day and had several operating modes and bombing options.

The system offered the crew three options to acquire, or see, the target in the pod&#x27;s television picture. In the most basic mode, the pod looked straight ahead, at the same location as the pilot&#x27;s pipper on his gunsight. The pilot pointed the gunsight at the target, the Weapon systems officer (WSO) saw it in the TV picture, and, after taking command of the pod, tracked the target with his radar control handle. This mode was called 12-acquire or 12-vis because the pod looked at the visual point at the jet&#x27;s 12 o&#x27;clock. A second acquisition mode was 9-acquire, or 9-vis. In this mode, the pod looked directly left of the aircraft at 9 o&#x27;clock. This mode enabled the crew to point the pod at the target before they rolled in on the attack if the target was on the left side of the airplane. The third mode, weapons release computer system acquire, was at once the most useful and the most difficult to use because of its complexity. During their mission planning, the crew measured the distance between a point that was easy to find and their intended target. As they approached the target, the crew could fly over the preplanned point, whereupon the WSO pushed a button that commanded the pod to look directly at the target over the premeasured distance.

All of these modes were particularly useful if the crews planned to fly at low altitude to the target, then pop up to higher altitudes to drop their LGB. In fact, a proficient crew might plan to use all three, each one as a backup for the other, during the attack. As the attackers zipped toward the target, they would plan to have the target offset to their left side. First, they would fly over a known point and insert the weapons release computer system (WRCS) offsets to slave the pod toward the target. Then, at a specific distance from the target, the pilot would select full afterburner and start a 20- or 30-degree climb, while visually scanning out the left side for the target. If the WRCS acquire worked perfectly, then the WSO would see the target in the picture. If not, and the pilot saw the target visually, he would tell the WSO to put the pod in 9-acquire to find the target. If that worked, fine, but if it did not, then the pilot would start a left roll in and put his pipper on the target, after telling the WSO to change acquisition modes again to the 12-acquire option.

For low altitude attacks crews adopted a 10-degree loft, from the target. With the pod in 12-acquire, the crew flew directly at the target at very low altitude. As soon as the WSO saw the target in his TV, he took command of the pod and started lasing the target. A cockpit indicator displayed exact laser range to the target, and, at precisely two miles from the target, the pilot depressed the release button and pulled sharply up. The computer would then release the bomb at 10 degrees of climb. The whole pull-up and release process took only two seconds. Immediately after the bomb came off, the pilot would start a 6-g turn away from the target and back to low altitude, while the WSO lased the target until the bomb hit.

In December 1978 the 414th Fighter Weapons Squadron got the opportunity to demonstrate how the Pave Spike pod and the new 500-pound GBU-12 Paveway II could perform at low altitude. The Air Force hosted a precision-guided munitions firepower demonstration for the secretary of defense to showcase improvements in precision munitions. The squadron successfully destroyed a fuel tank partially filled with expired jet fuel with four LGBs in a low-altitude loft attack. By the end of the 1970s Pave Spike tactics and systems were a mature part of the F-4 fleet.

Even though Pave Spike was a good system, it was suited for use only during periods of good visibility during the daytime. At night, in haze, or in bad weather, the pod was virtually useless.

==Service==
156 examples of the original AN/ASQ-153 were used from 1974 through 1989. 

In 1979, the Royal Air Force acquired a number of the simplified AN/AVQ-23E pods for their Blackburn Buccaneers. Twelve aircraft equipped with the pod were deployed to Saudi Arabia for the Gulf War to initially perform laser designation for other RAF aircraft Later in the air campaign, these aircraft would carry laser-designated bombs themselves.

The pod is now obsolete, and is being phased out in favour of newer systems like LANTIRN and AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR.

The National Museum of the United States Air Force holds a Pave Spike in its collection.

<text>Bryanston is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated on the River Stour west of Blandford Forum. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 925. The village is adjacent to the grounds of Bryanston School, an independent school.

The village was named after Brian de Lisle, a Baron at the court of King John. The Rogers family owned it for a long period of time, and it was later purchased by Sir William Portman, 6th Baronet, who took part in crushing Monmouth&#x27;s rebellion in 1685. In the 1890s the Portman family built a large country house, designed by Richard Norman Shaw and set in . Since 1927 the building has been the home of Bryanston School. In 1950 Viscount Portman gave up the Bryanston Estates as part payment of death duties. The estate was then owned by the crown until 2015 when the estate was purchased by a UK company held on behalf of the Viscount Rothermere and his son the Hon Vere Harmsworth for an initially undisclosed sum, which the Crown Estate confirmed in a Freedom Of Information request to have been £43million.

<doc id="1071607" wikidata="Q1594238" url="?curid=1071607" title="Bone char">
<text>Bone char () is a porous, black, granular material produced by charring animal bones. Its composition varies depending on how it is made; however, it consists mainly of tricalcium phosphate (or hydroxyapatite) 57–80%, calcium carbonate 6–10% and carbon 7–10%. It is primarily used for filtration and decolorisation.

==Production==
Bone char is primarily made from cattle and pig bones; however, to prevent the spread of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, the skull and spine are no longer used. The bones are heated in a sealed vessel at up to ; the oxygen concentration must be kept low while doing this, as it affects the quality of the product, particularly its adsorption capacity. Most of the organic material in the bones is driven off by heat, and was historically collected as Dippel&#x27;s oil; that which is not driven off remains as activated carbon in the final product. Heating bones in an oxygen-rich atmosphere gives bone ash, which is chemically quite different.

Used bone char can be regenerated by washing with hot water to remove impurities, followed by heating to in a kiln with a controlled amount of air.

== Uses ==

===Water treatment===
The tricalcium phosphate in bone char can be used to remove fluoride and metal ions from water, making it useful for the treatment of drinking supplies.
Bone charcoal is the oldest known water defluoridation agent and was widely used in the United States from the 1940s through to the 1960s. As it can be generated cheaply and locally it is still used in certain developing countries, such as Tanzania.
Bone chars usually have lower surface areas than activated carbons, but present high adsorptive capacities for certain metals, particularly those from group 12 (copper, zinc, and cadmium). Other highly toxic metal ions, such as those of arsenic and lead may also be removed.
The practical example of the use of bone char in water purification is demonstrated by use of nanofiltration in Tanzania.

===Sugar refining===
Historically, bone char was often used in sugar refining as a decolorizing and deashing agent, particularly in cane sugar as this contains more colored impurities.

Bone char possesses a low decoloration capacity and must be used in large quantities, however, it is also able to remove various inorganic impurities, most importantly sulfates and the ions of magnesium and calcium. The removal of these is beneficial, as it reduces the level of scaling later in the refining process, when the sugar solution is concentrated. Modern alternatives to bone char include activated carbon and ion-exchange resins. However, a small number of companies remain completely or partially dependent on bone char for sugar refinement.

===Black pigment===
Bone char is also used as a black pigment for artist&#x27;s paint, printmaking, calligraphic and drawing inks as well as other artistic applications because of its deepness of color and excellent tinting strength. Bone black and ivory black are artists&#x27; pigments which have been in use since historic times—by both old masters like Rembrandt and Velázquez and more modern painters such as Manet and Picasso. The black dresses and high hats of the gentlemen in Manet&#x27;s &quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot; are painted in ivory black.

Ivory black was formerly made by grinding charred ivory in oil. Nowadays ivory black is considered a synonym for bone black. Actual ivory is no longer used because of the expense and because animals that are natural sources of ivory are subject to international control as endangered species.

===Niche uses===
*It is used to refine crude oil in the production of petroleum jelly.
*In the 18th and 19th centuries, bone char mixed with tallow or wax (or both) was used by soldiers in the field to impregnate military leather equipment, both to increase its lifespan and as the simplest way to obtain pigment for black leatherware. Military and civilians used it as shoe polish and preservative, including on shoes with the &quot;rough&quot; side out. In period reference materials, it is referred to as &quot;black ball&quot;.
*The ESA-NASA Solar Orbiter satellite uses a refined form of bone char applied to its titanium heatshield. This protects it against the glare and heat of the sun. Irish company Embio developed the coating and uses its &#x27;CoBlast&#x27; technique, originally developed to coat titanium medical implants.
==In popular culture==
* The production of bone char was featured on the Discovery Channel&#x27;s TV series &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;, on episode 19 of season 5, &quot;Bone Black&quot;, originally broadcast on 9 February 2010.
* Human bone char, referred to as &quot;bone charcoal&quot;, is mentioned in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;. The bones come from US soldiers who died in combat during WWII and were buried in a lake in Italy, and the char is used for filters in cigarettes.
* Human bone char is mentioned in Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;. The work contains a reference to soldiers not dying in vain because their bones will be used to make bone charcoal (&quot;spodium&quot;) for sugar refineries, the protagonist getting disciplined by his commander for wondering whether the coal from officers&#x27; bones is sold to the refineries at a higher price than that made from ordinary privates&#x27; bones.

<doc id="1071613" wikidata="Q131584" url="?curid=1071613" title="Papaver somniferum">
<text>Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy or breadseed poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is the species of plant from which both opium and poppy seeds are derived and is also a valuable ornamental plant grown in gardens. Its native range was the eastern Mediterranean region, but has since been obscured by widespread introduction and cultivation since ancient times to the present day. It is now naturalized across much of the world with temperate climates.

This poppy is grown as an agricultural crop on a large scale, for one of three primary purposes: to produce poppy seeds, to produce opium (for use mainly by the pharmaceutical industry), and to produce other alkaloids (mainly thebaine and oripavine) that are processed by pharmaceutical companies into drugs such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. Each of these goals has special breeds that are targeted at one of these businesses, and breeding efforts (including biotechnological ones) are continually underway. A comparatively small amount of &quot;P. somniferum&quot; is also produced commercially for ornamental purposes.

Today many varieties have been bred that do not produce a significant quantity of opium. The cultivar &#x27;Sujata&#x27; produces no latex at all. Breadseed poppy is more accurate as a common name today because all varieties of &quot;P. somniferum&quot; produce edible seeds. This differentiation has strong implications for legal policy surrounding the growing of this plant.

==Description==
&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; is an annual herb growing to about tall. The plant is strongly glaucous, giving a greyish-green appearance, and the stem and leaves bear a sparse distribution of coarse hairs. The large leaves are lobed, the upper stem leaves clasping the stem, the lowest leaves with a short petiole. The flowers are up to diameter, normally with four white, mauve or red petals, sometimes with dark markings at the base. The fruit is a hairless, rounded capsule topped with 12–18 radiating stigmatic rays, or fluted cap. All parts of the plant exude white latex when wounded.

=== Metabolism ===
The alkaloids are organic nitrogenous compounds, derivatives of secondary metabolism, synthesized through the metabolic pathway of benzylisoquinoline. First, the amino acid phenylalanine, through the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, is transformed into tyrosine. Tyrosine can follow two different routes: by tyrosine hydroxylase it can form L-dopamine (L-DOPA), or it can be reduced to form 4-phenylhydroxyacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Subsequently, L-DOPA reacts with 4-HPAA and, through a series of reactions, forms (S) -norcoclaurine, which carries the benzylisoquinoline skeleton that gives its name to this pathway. The conversion of (S) -norcoclaurin to (S) -reticuline is one of the key points, since from (S) -reticuline morphine can be formed through the morphinan route, noscapine through the path of the noscapina or berberina.

=== Genome ===
The poppy genome contains 51,213 genes encoding proteins distributed 81.6% in 11 individual chromosomes and 18.4% remaining in unplaced scaffolds. In addition, 70.9% of the genome is made up of repetitive elements, of which the most represented are the long terminal repeat retrotransposons. This enrichment of genes is related to the maintenance of homeostasis and a positive regulation of transcription.

The analysis of synergy of the opium poppy reveals traces of segmental duplications 110 million years ago (MYA), before the divergence between &quot;Papaveraceae&quot; and Ranunculaceae, and an event of duplication of the complete genome makes 7.8 MYA.

The genes are possibly grouped as follows:

* The genes responsible for the conversion of (S) -reticuline to noscapine are found on chromosome 11.
* The genes responsible for the conversion of (S) -reticuline to thebaine are found on chromosome 11.
* The genes responsible for the conversion of thebaine are found in chromosome 1, chromosome 2, chromosome 7, and perhaps others.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; was formally described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in his seminal publication &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753 on page 508.

===Varieties and cultivars ===
&quot;P. somniferum&quot; has had a very long tradition of use, starting in the Neolithic. This long period of time allowed the development of a broad range of different forms. In total there are 52 botanical varieties. Breeding of &quot;P. somniferum&quot; faces a challenge caused by the contradictory breeding goals for this species. On one hand a very high content of alkaloids is requested for medical uses. The global demand for the alkaloids and the pharmaceutical derivatives has increased in the past years. Therefore, there is a need for the development of varieties with a high opium yield. On the other hand, the food industry demands as low alkaloid contents as possible.

There is one accepted subspecies, &quot;P. somniferum&quot; subsp. &quot;setigerum&quot; (DC.) Arcang. There are also many varieties and cultivars. Colors of the flowers vary widely, as do other physical characteristics, such as number and shape of petals , number of flowers and fruits, number of seeds, color of seeds, and production of opium. &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; var. &quot;paeoniflorum&quot; is a variety with flowers that are highly double, and are grown in many colors. &quot;P. somniferum&quot; var. &quot;laciniatum&quot; is a variety with flowers that are highly double and deeply lobed. The variety &quot;Sujata&quot; produces no latex and no commercial utility for opioid production.

==Distribution and habitat==
The native range of opium poppy is probably the Eastern Mediterranean, but extensive cultivation and introduction of the species throughout Europe since ancient times have obscured its origin. It has escaped from cultivation, or has been introduced and become naturalized extensively in all regions of the British Isles, particularly in the south and east and in almost all other countries of the world with suitable, temperate climates.

== Ecology ==
=== Diseases ===
&quot;P. somniferum&quot; is susceptible to several fungal, insect and virus infections including seed borne diseases such as downy mildew and root rot. The use of pesticides in combination to cultural methods have been considered as major control measures for various poppy diseases.

The fungal pathogen &quot;Peronospora arborescens&quot;, the causal agent of downy mildew, occurs preferentially during wet and humid conditions. This oomycete penetrates the roots through oospores and infects the leaves as conidia in a secondary infection. The fungus causes hypertrophy and curvature of the stem and flower stalks. The symptoms are chlorosis and curling of the affected tissues with necrotic spots. The leaf under-surface is covered with a downy mildew coating containing conidiospores that spread the infection further leading to plant damage and death. Another downy mildew species, &quot;Peronospora somniferi&quot;, produces systemic infections leading to stunting and deformation of poppy plants. Downy mildew can be controlled preventively at the initial stage of seed development through several fungicide applications.

Leaf blight caused by the fungus &quot;Helminthosporium papaveris&quot; is one of the most destructive poppy diseases worldwide. The seed-borne fungus causes root rot in young plants and stunted stems in plants at a higher development stage, where leaf spots appear on the leaves and is being transmitted to capsules and seeds. Early sowing of seeds and deep plowing of poppy residues can reduce fungal inoculum during the plant growing season in the following year on neighboring poppy stocks, respectively.

Mosaic diseases in &quot;p. somniferum&quot; are caused by rattle virus and the Carlavirus. In 2006, a novel virus tentatively called &quot;opium poppy mosaic virus&quot; (OPMV) from the genus &quot;Umbravirus&quot; was isolated from &quot;p. somniferum&quot; containing leaf mosaic and mottling symptoms, in New Zealand.

=== Pests ===
There are only a few pests that can do harm to &quot;P. somniferum&quot;.

Flea beetles perforate the leaves of young plants and aphids suck on the sap of the flower buds. The poppy root weevil (&quot;Stenocarus ruficornis&quot;) is another significant pest. The insect lives in the soil and migrates in spring to the poppy fields after crop emergence. Adults damage the leaves of small plants by eating them. Female lay their eggs into the tissue of lower leaves. Insect larvae hatch and burrow into the soil to complete their life cycle on the poppy roots as adults.

==Cultivation==

In the growth development of &quot;P. somniferum&quot;, six stages can be distinguished. The growth development starts with the growth of the seedlings. In a second step the rosette-type leaves and stalks are formed. After that budding (hook stage) takes place as a third step. The hook stage is followed by flowering. Subsequently, technical maturity is reached, which means that the plant is ready for cutting. The last step is biological maturity; dry seeds are ripened. The photoperiod seems to be the main determinant of flower development of &quot;P. somniferum&quot;.

&quot;P. somniferum&quot; shows a very slow development in the beginning of its vegetation period. Due to this fact the competition of weeds is very high in early stages. It is very important to control weeds effectively in the first 50 days after sowing. Additionally, &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; is rather susceptible to herbicides. The pre-emergence application of the herbicide chlortoluron has been shown to be effective in reducing weed levels. However, in the last decade the weed management of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; has shifted from pre-emergence treatments to post-emergence treatments. Especially, the application of the two herbicides mesotrione and tembotrione has become very popular. The combined application of those two herbicides has been shown to be recommendable for effective weed management in &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;. Sowing time (autumn or spring), preceding crop and soil texture are important variables influencing the weed species composition. A highly abundant weed species in &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; fields was shown to be &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;. &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; and &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot; are congeners and belong to the same plant family, which impedes the chemical control of this weed species. Therefore, weed management represents a big challenge and requires technological knowledge from the farmer. In order to increase the efficiency of weed control not only chemical weed control should be applied but also mechanical weed control.

For &quot;P. somniferum&quot;, a growth density of 70 to 80 plants per square meter is recommended. Latex-to-biomass yield is greatest under conditions of slight water deficit.

===Ornamental===
Live plants and seeds of the opium poppy are widely sold by seed companies and nurseries in most of the western world, including the United States. Poppies are sought after by gardeners for the vivid coloration of the blooms, the hardiness and reliability of the poppy plants, the exotic chocolate-vegetal fragrance note of some cultivars, and the ease of growing the plants from purchased flats of seedlings or by direct sowing of the seed. Poppy seed pods are also sold for dried flower arrangements.

Though &quot;opium poppy and poppy straw&quot; are listed in Schedule II of the United States&#x27; Controlled Substances Act, &quot;P. somniferum&quot; can be grown legally in the United States as a seed crop or ornamental flower. During the summer, opium poppies can be seen flowering in gardens throughout North America and Europe, and displays are found in many private plantings, as well as in public botanical and museum gardens such as United States Botanical Garden, Missouri Botanical Garden, and North Carolina Botanical Garden.

Many countries grow the plants, and some rely heavily on the commercial production of the drug as a major source of income. As an additional source of profit, the seeds of the same plants are sold for use in foods, so the cultivation of the plant is a significant source of income. This international trade in seeds of &quot;P. somniferum&quot; was addressed by a UN resolution &quot;to fight the international trade in illicit opium poppy seeds&quot; on 28 July 1998.

===Production===
====Food====

In 2018, world production of poppy seeds for consumption was 76,240 tonnes, led by Turkey with 35% of the world total (table). Poppy seed production and trade are susceptible to fluctuations mainly due to unstable yields. The performance of most genotypes of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; is very susceptible to environmental changes. This behaviour led to a stagnation of the poppy seed market value between 2008 and 2009 as a consequence of high stock levels, bad weather and poor quality. The world leading importer of poppy seed is India (16 000 tonnes), followed by Russia, Poland and Germany.

Poppy seed oil remains a niche product due to the lower yield compared to conventional oil crops.

====Medicine====
Australia (Tasmania), Turkey and India are the major producers of poppy for medicinal purposes and poppy-based drugs, such as morphine or codeine. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, in 2014, that Tasmania was the largest producer of the poppy cultivars used for thebaine (85% of the world&#x27;s supply) and oripavine (100% of the world&#x27;s supply) production. Tasmania also had 25% of the world&#x27;s opium and codeine production.

===Restrictions===
In most of Central and Eastern Europe, poppy seed is commonly used for traditional pastries and cakes, and it is legal to grow poppies throughout the region, although Germany requires a licence.

Since January 1999 in the Czech Republic, according to the &quot;167/1998 Sb. Addictive Substances Act&quot;, poppies growing in fields larger than is obliged for reporting to the local Custom Office. Extraction of opium from the plants is prohibited by law (§ 15 letter d/ of the act). It is also prohibited to grow varieties with more than 0.8% of morphine in dry matter of their capsules, excluding research and experimental purposes (§24/1b/ of the act). The name &quot;Czech blue poppy&quot; refers to blue poppy seeds used for food.

The United Kingdom does not require a licence for opium poppy cultivation, but does for extracting opium for medicinal products.

In the United States, opium poppies and poppy straw are prohibited. As the opium poppy is legal for culinary or esthetic reasons, poppies were once grown as a cash crop by farmers in California. The law of poppy cultivation in the United States is somewhat ambiguous. The reason for the ambiguity is that the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942 (now repealed) stated that any opium poppies should be declared illegal, except if the farmers were issued a state permit. § 3 of the Opium Poppy Control Act stated: It shall be unlawful for any person who is not the holder of a license authorizing him to produce the opium poppy, duly issued to him by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with the provisions of this Act, to produce the opium poppy, or to permit the production of the opium poppy in or upon any place owned, occupied, used, or controlled by him. This led to the Poppy Rebellion, and to the Narcotics Bureau arresting anyone planting opium poppies and forcing the destruction of poppy fields of anyone who defied the prohibition of poppy cultivation. Though the press of those days favored the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the state of California supported the farmers who grew opium poppies for their seeds for uses in foods such as poppy seed muffins. Today, this area of law has remained vague and remains somewhat controversial in the United States. The Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942 was repealed on 27 October 1970.

Under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, opium poppy and poppy straw are listed as Schedule II drugs under ACSN 9630. Most (all?) states also use this classification under the uniform penal code. Possession of a Schedule II drug is a federal and state felony.

Canada forbids possessing, seeking or obtaining the opium poppy &quot;(Papaver somniferum)&quot;, its preparations, derivatives, alkaloids and salts, although an exception is made for poppy seed.

In some parts of Australia, &quot;P. somniferum&quot; is illegal to cultivate, but in Tasmania, some 50% of the world supply is cultivated.

In New Zealand, it is legal to cultivate the opium poppy as long as it is not used to produce controlled drugs.

In United Arab Emirates the cultivation of the opium poppy is illegal, as is possession of poppy seed. At least one man has been imprisoned for possessing poppy seed obtained from a bread roll.

Burma bans cultivation in certain provinces. In northern Burma bans have ended a century-old tradition of growing the opium poppy. Between 20,000 and 30,000 former poppy farmers left the Kokang region as a result of the ban in 2002. People from the Wa region, where the ban was implemented in 2005, fled to areas where growing opium is still possible.

In South Korea, the cultivation of the opium poppy is strictly prohibited.

==Uses==
===History===
Use of the opium poppy predates written history. The making and use of opium was known to the ancient Minoans. Its sap was later named &quot;opion&quot; by the ancient Greeks. The English name is based on the Latin adaptation of the Greek form.
Evidence of the early domestication of opium poppy has been discovered through small botanical remains found in regions of the Mediterranean and west of the Rhine River, predating circa 5000 BC. These samples found in various Neolithic sites show the incredibly early cultivation and natural spread of the plant throughout western Europe.

Opium was used for treating asthma, stomach illnesses, and bad eyesight.

Opium became a major colonial commodity, moving legally and illegally through trade networks on the Indian subcontinent, Colonial America, Qing China and others. Members of the East India Company saw the opium trade as an investment opportunity beginning in 1683. In 1773, the Governor of Bengal established a monopoly on the production of Bengal opium, on behalf of the East India Company administration. The cultivation and manufacture of Indian opium was further centralized and controlled through a series of acts issued between 1797 and 1949. East India Company merchants balanced an economic deficit from the importation of Chinese tea by selling Indian opium which was smuggled into China in defiance of Qing government bans. This trade led to the First and Second Opium Wars.

Many modern writers, particularly in the 19th century, have written on the opium poppy and its effects, notably Thomas de Quincey in &quot;Confessions of an English Opium Eater&quot;.

The French Romantic composer Hector Berlioz used opium for inspiration, subsequently producing his Symphonie Fantastique. In this work, a young artist overdoses on opium and experiences a series of visions of his unrequited love.

In the US, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello estate in 1987. It removed the poppy plants that had been planted continually there since Jefferson was alive and using opium from them. Employees of the foundation also destroyed gift shop items like shirts depicting the poppy and packets of the heirloom seed.

===Poppy seeds and oil===


Poppy seeds from &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; are an important food item and the source of poppy seed oil, an edible oil that has many uses. The seeds contain very low levels of opiates and the oil extracted from them contains even less. Both the oil and the seed residue also have commercial uses.

The poppy press cake as a residue of the oil pressing can be used as fodder for different animals as e.g., poultry and fancy fowls. Especially in the time of the molt of the birds, the cake is nutritive and fits to their special needs. Next to the animal fodder, poppy offers other by-products. For example, the stem of the plant can be used for energy briquettes and pellets to heat.

Poppy seeds are used as a food in many cultures. They may be used whole by bakers to decorate their products or milled and mixed with sugar as a sweet filling. They have a creamy and nut-like flavor, and when used with ground coconut, the seeds provide a unique and flavour-rich curry base. They can be dry roasted and ground to be used in wet curry (curry paste) or dry curry.

When the European Union attempted to ban the cultivation of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; by private individuals on a small scale (such as personal gardens), citizens in EU countries where poppy seed is eaten heavily, such as countries in the Central-Eastern region, strongly resisted the plan, causing the EU to change course. Singapore, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are among nations that ban even having poppy seeds, not just growing the plants for them. The UAE has a long prison sentence for anyone possessing poppy seeds.

===Opiates===

The opium poppy is the principal source of opium, the dried latex produced by the seed pods. Opium contains a class of naturally occurring alkaloids known as opiates, that include morphine, codeine, thebaine, oripavine, papaverine and noscapine. The specific epithet &quot;somniferum&quot; means &quot;sleep-bringing&quot;, referring to the sedative properties of some of these opiates.

The opiate drugs are extracted from opium. The latex oozes from incisions made on the green seed pods and is collected once dry. Tincture of opium or laudanum, consisting of opium dissolved in alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and water, is one of many unapproved drugs regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its marketing and distribution persists because its historical use preceded the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act of 1938. Tincture of opium B.P., containing 1% w/v of anhydrous morphine, also remains in the British Pharmacopoeia, listed as a Class A substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

Morphine is the predominant alkaloid found in the cultivated varieties of opium poppy that are used for opium production. Other varieties produce minimal opium or none at all, such as the latex-free Sujata type. Non-opium cultivars that are planted for drug production feature a high level of thebaine or oripavine. Those are refined into drugs like oxycodone. Raw opium contains about 8–14% morphine by dry weight, or more in high-yield cultivars. It may be used directly or chemically modified to produce semi-synthetic opioids such as heroin.

==Culture==
Opium poppies (flower and fruit) appear on the coat of arms of the Royal College of Anaesthetists.

<text>The Chicago Reader, or Reader (stylized as ЯEADER), is an American alternative newspaper in Chicago, Illinois, noted for its literary style of journalism and coverage of the arts, particularly film and theater. The &quot;Reader&quot; has been recognized as a pioneer among alternative weeklies for both its creative nonfiction and its commercial scheme. Richard Karpel, then-executive director of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, wrote:

[T]he most significant historical event in the creation of the modern alt-weekly occurred in Chicago in 1971, when the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; pioneered the practice of free circulation, a cornerstone of today&#x27;s alternative papers. The &quot;Reader&quot; also developed a new kind of journalism, ignoring the news and focusing on everyday life and ordinary people.

The &quot;Reader&quot; was founded by a group of friends from Carleton College, and four of them remained its primary owners for 36 years. While annual revenue reached an all-time high of $22.6 million in 2002, double what it had been a decade earlier, profits and readership then went into steep decline, and ownership changed several times between 2007 and 2018. In 2022, the owners transferred the &quot;Reader&quot; to a new non-profit organization, the Reader Institute for Community Journalism.

On June 22, 2020, the &quot;Reader&quot;, citing a 90% drop in advertising revenue due to COVID-19 shutdowns, announced that it was pivoting from a weekly to a biweekly print schedule, with a renewed focus on digital content and storytelling and a refreshed special issues calendar. The Reader returned to weekly publishing in June 2024. The &quot;Reader&quot; is dated every Thursday and distributed free on Wednesday and Thursday via street boxes and cooperating retail outlets. the paper claimed to have nearly 1,200 locations in the Chicago metropolitan area and circulation of 60,000, a fraction of what circulation had been in the mid-2000s. The &quot;Reader&quot; remains among the largest and most successful alternative newspapers in the country. Weekly readership had once been put at 450,000. 

==Publication history==

=== 1971–1995 ===
&quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; was founded by Robert A. Roth, who grew up in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. His ambition was to start a weekly publication for young Chicagoans like Boston&#x27;s &quot;The Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Boston After Dark&quot;. Those papers were sold on newsstands but were also given away, mostly on campuses, to bolster circulation. Roth believed that 100-percent free circulation would work better, and he persuaded several friends from Carleton College, including Robert E. McCamant, Thomas J. Rehwaldt and Thomas K. Yoder, to join him in his venture. They pooled about $16,000 (about $125,000 in 2024 dollars) and published the first issue, 16 pages, on October 1, 1971.

One year later, in its first anniversary issue, the &quot;Reader&quot; published an article titled &quot;What Kind of Paper is This, Anyway?&quot; in which it answered &quot;Questions we&#x27;ve heard over and over in the past year.&quot; This article reported that the paper had lost nearly $20,000 in its first ten months of operation but that the owners were &quot;confident it will work out in the end.&quot; It explained the rationale behind free circulation and the paper&#x27;s unconventional editorial philosophy: &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t the &quot;Reader&quot; print news? Tom Wolfe wrote us, &#x27;The Future of the newspaper (as opposed to the past, which is available at every newsstand) lies in your direction, i.e., the sheet willing to deal with &quot;the way we live now. That sums up our thoughts quite well: we find street sellers more interesting than politicians, and musicians more interesting than the Cubs. They are closer to home.&quot;

In its early years the Reader was published out of apartments shared by the owner-founders, Roth, McCamant, Rehwaldt and Yoder. The first apartment was in Hyde Park—the University of Chicago neighborhood on the south side of Chicago—and the second was in Rogers Park on the far north side. Working for ownership in lieu of pay, the owner-founders ultimately owned more than 90% of the company. In 1975 the paper began to earn a profit, incorporated, and rented office space in the downtown area that later came to be known as River North.

In 1979, a reporter for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of Arlington Heights, Illinois, called the &quot;Reader&quot; &quot;the fastest growing alternative weekly in the U.S.&quot; In 1986, an article in the Chicago Tribune estimated the &quot;Reader&quot;&#x27;s annual revenues at $6.7 million. In 1996, &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot; projected revenue of $14.6 million. The National Journal&#x27;s Convention Daily (published during the 1996 Democratic National Convention in Chicago) reported that the &quot;Reader&quot; was &quot;an enormous financial success. It&#x27;s now as thick as many Sunday papers and is published in four sections that total around 180 pages.&quot; This report put the circulation at 138,000.

=== 1995–2006 ===
The &quot;Reader&quot; began experimenting with electronic distribution in 1995 with an automated telephone service called &quot;SpaceFinder&quot;, which offered search and &quot;faxback&quot; delivery of the paper&#x27;s apartment rental ads, one of its most important franchises. Later in 1995 the paper&#x27;s &quot;Matches&quot; personal ads were made available on the Web, and in early 1996 the SpaceFinder fax system was adapted for Web searching. Also in 1996 the &quot;Reader&quot; partnered with Yahoo to bring its entertainment listings online and introduced a Web site and an AOL user area built around its popular syndicated column &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;.

The &quot;Reader&quot; became so profitable in the late 1990s that it added a suburban edition, &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Guide to Arts &amp; Entertainment,&quot; but by 2006 it was operating at a loss. It faced severe competitive pressure starting near the turn of the century, as some of its key elements became widely available online. Websites offered entertainment listings, schedules, and reviews. Classified ads, a major source of revenue in the 1990s, migrated to Craigslist and other online services that published ads for free and made them easily searchable.

By 2000 much of the paper&#x27;s content was available online, but the &quot;Reader&quot; still resisted publishing a Web version of the entire paper. It concentrated on database information like classifieds and listings, leaving the long cover stories and many other articles to be delivered in print only. In 2005, when many similar publications had long been offering all their content online, the &quot;Reader&quot; began offering its articles in PDF format, showing pages just as they appeared in print — an attempt to provide value to the display advertisers who accounted for much of the paper&#x27;s revenue. By 2007 the PDFs were gone and all of the paper&#x27;s content was available online, along with a variety of blogs and Web-only features.

A 2008 article in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; by Edward McClelland, a former &quot;Reader&quot; staff writer (then known as Ted Kleine), faulted the &quot;Reader&quot; for having been slow to embrace the Web and suggested that it had trouble appealing to a new generation of young readers. &quot;Alternative weeklies are expected to be eternally youthful&quot;, McClelland wrote. &quot;The &quot;Reader&quot; is finding that a tough act to pull off as it approaches forty.&quot; He also suggested the &quot;Reader&quot; had grown complacent &quot;because it was still raking in ad profits through the early 2000s&quot; and its troubles were aggravated by a 2004 makeover that included &quot;features on fashion&quot; and a &quot;tattooed, twenty-seven-year-old stripper&quot; writing a late-night party column. &quot;The feeling was the &quot;Reader&quot; had to be reinvented ... and change its character.&quot;

=== 2007–2017 ===
After being owned by the same four founders since 1971, ownership of the &quot;Reader&quot; changed several times between 2007 and 2018.

The precipitous decline in profits from 2004 to 2006 prompted owner-founder Tom Rehwaldt to file a lawsuit against the company. This lawsuit led to the sale of the &quot;Reader&quot; and its sibling, &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;, to Creative Loafing in July 2007, publisher of alternative weeklies in Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Tampa and Sarasota, Florida. Creative Loafing filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. In August 2009, the bankruptcy court awarded the company to Creative Loafing&#x27;s chief creditor, Atalaya Capital Management, which had loaned $30 million to pay for most of the purchase price for the &quot;Reader&quot; and the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;.

In late 2007, under a budget cutback imposed by the new owners at Creative Loafing, the &quot;Reader&quot; laid off several of its most experienced journalists, including John Conroy, Harold Henderson, Tori Marlan and Steve Bogira. The paper had de-emphasized the tradition of offbeat feature stories in favor of theme issues and aggressive, opinionated reporting on city government, for example its extensive coverage of tax increment financing (TIFs) by Ben Joravsky, who has been a staff writer since the 1980s. Though the staff was much smaller than it was before the sale, many other key figures remained as of June 2010, including media critic Michael Miner, film critic J.R. Jones, arts reporter Deanna Isaacs, food writer Mike Sula, theater critic Albert Williams, and music writers Peter Margasak and Miles Raymer. In November 2009, James Warren, former managing editor for features at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, was named president and publisher. In March, 2010, Warren resigned. In June, longtime editor Alison True was fired by acting publisher Alison Draper and Creative Loafing CEO Marty Petty, sparking outrage among the paper&#x27;s remaining audience. In July, Draper was named publisher, managing editor Kiki Yablon was promoted to editor, and Geoff Dougherty was named associate publisher. Dougherty had founded and subsequently closed the online Chi-Town Daily News and its successor, the print-and-online Chicago Current, which he closed to take the &quot;Reader&quot; job.

In 2012, the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; was acquired by Wrapports LLC, parent company of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

Managing editor Jake Malooley was formally named Editor-in-Chief in July 2015. In February 2018 Malooley was fired by phone at O&#x27;Hare Airport as he returned from his honeymoon by newly appointed Executive Editor Mark Konkol. Konkol was fired by Sun-Times Media only 19 days after his appointment, following the publication of a controversial editorial cartoon that was deemed to be race baiting.

On July 13, 2017, a consortium consisting of private investors &amp; the Chicago Federation of Labor, led by businessman &amp; former Chicago alderman Edwin Eisendrath, through Eisendrath&#x27;s company, ST Acquisition Holdings, acquired the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; from Wrapports, beating out Chicago-based publishing company Tronc for ownership.

=== 2018–2025===
Effective October 1, 2018, Sun-Times Media sold the &quot;Reader&quot; to a private investment group, which formed an L3C to make the purchase. The major investors were Chicagoans Elzie Higginbottom and Leonard Goodman. Tracy Baim was named publisher and Anne Elizabeth Moore editor. Moore&#x27;s tenure as editor was short-lived; she abruptly departed in March 2019. In June 2019 Karen Hawkins and Sujay Kumar were announced as new editors in chief, previously managing editors who had been serving as interim editors in chief following Moore&#x27;s departure. In November 2020, the &quot;Reader&quot; announced co-editor Hawkins would also serve as co-publisher with Baim, while Baim was also made president.

On June 22, 2020, the &quot;Reader&quot;, citing a 90% drop in advertising revenue due to COVID-19 shutdowns, announced that it was pivoting from a weekly to a biweekly print schedule, with a renewed focus on digital content and storytelling and a refreshed special issues calendar.

On May 16, 2022, ownership of the &quot;Reader&quot; was transferred to the new non-profit organization Reader Institute for Community Journalism. The transfer had been delayed by a debilitating public dispute between publisher Tracy Baim and then-editor in chief Karen Hawkins on one side, and co-owner Leonard Goodman on the other, in 2021 and 2022.

Goodman, who had submitted a semi-regular column for the &quot;Reader&quot; since he and Higginbottom acquired the newspaper, wrote one (edited by Hawkins) in November 2021 about his hesitancy to vaccinate his young daughter against COVID-19. 

After the column appeared in print, objections from the editorial staff and a public outcry prompted Baim and Hawkins to first defend the column (Hawkins tweeted in defense of it and privately assured Goodman the column was &quot;bulletproof&quot;) before changing their minds and commissioning a post-publication fact-check that found multiple inaccuracies and errors. Baim proposed publishing the fact-check online with the column, but Goodman and allied board members accused Baim of censorship and demanded her resignation before allowing the transfer to a nonprofit; she refused. Baim, Goodman, and the board remained in a stalemate for months, unable to reach an agreement. 

In April 2022 the newspaper&#x27;s editorial union, saying the dispute threatened the future of the newspaper, mounted a public pressure campaign that culminated in protests outside of Goodman&#x27;s mansion, and after two weeks, he agreed to give up ownership and allow the transfer to a nonprofit. In return, Baim agreed to keep the column at the center of the dispute online.

In June 2022, Hawkins left the &quot;Reader&quot;. In August, Baim announced that she would resign by the end of the year. Solomon Lieberman was hired as new CEO and publisher in February 2023. Salem Collo-Julin was named editor in chief in March 2023.

In May 2024, the newspaper announced it would return to a weekly print schedule.

In January 2025, Lieberman resigned, and the RICJ announced a round of layoffs due to &quot;a combination of financial losses, operational challenges, and external pressures [that] has brought the Reader to an imminent risk of closure.&quot;

== Content ==
The &quot;Reader&quot; was designed to serve young readers, mostly singles in their 20s, who in the early 1970s lived in distinct neighborhoods along Chicago&#x27;s lakefront, such as Hyde Park, Lincoln Park, and Lake View. Later this demographic group moved west, to neighborhoods like Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Logan Square, and the &quot;Reader&quot; moved with them. The paper&#x27;s appeal was based on a variety of elements. Most obvious early on was a focus on pop culture for a generation who were not served by the entertainment coverage of daily newspapers. Like many alternative weeklies, the &quot;Reader&quot; relied heavily on coverage and extensive listings of arts and cultural events, especially live music, film, and theater.

As the paper prospered and its budget expanded, investigative and political reporting became another important part of the mix. &quot;Reader&quot; articles by freelance writer David Moberg are credited with helping to elect Chicago&#x27;s first black mayor, the late Harold Washington. Staff writer John Conroy wrote extensively, over a period of more than 17 years, on police torture in Chicago; his reporting was instrumental in the ouster and prosecution of Commander Jon Burge, the leader of a police torture ring, and in the release of several wrongly convicted prisoners from death row.

The &quot;Reader&quot; was perhaps best known for its deep, immersive style of literary journalism, publishing long, detailed cover stories, often on subjects that had little to do with the news of the day. An oft-cited example is a 19,000-word article on beekeeping by staff editor Michael Lenehan. This article won the AAAS Westinghouse Science Journalism Award, awarded by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in 1978. Steve Bogira&#x27;s 1988 article &quot;A Fire in the Family&quot; used an apartment-building fire as the starting point for a 15,000-word chronicle of life among the underclass, following three generations of a west-side family and touching on urban issues such as addiction, discrimination, crime, and teen pregnancy. It won the Peter Lisagor Award for Exemplary Journalism, awarded by the Chicago Headline Club. Ben Joravsky&#x27;s &quot;A Simple Game&quot; followed a public high school basketball team for a full year. Published in two parts, a total of 40,000 words, it was reprinted in the anthology &quot;Best American Sportswriting 1993&quot;. Contributor Lee Sandlin&#x27;s two-part 1997 essay, “Losing the War,” was later adapted for broadcast by the public radio show &quot;This American Life&quot; and it was anthologized in a 2007 collection, &quot;The New Kings of Nonfiction&quot;. The &quot;Reader&quot; has won 30 Alternative Newsweekly Awards since 1996.

Another element of the &quot;Reader&quot;″s appeal was its free classified ads to individuals. Ads were seen as another source of information alongside the journalism and listings.

== Design and format ==
The original look of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; in 1971 was devised by owner-founder Bob McCamant. In 2004, a redesign by the Barcelona, Spain, firm of Jardi + Utensil introduced a new logo and extensive use of color, including a magazine-style cover. In 2007, under the ownership of Creative Loafing, the paper was converted to a single-section tabloid. In 2010, Publisher Alison Draper hired Chicago-based redesign consultant Ron Reason to help revamp the publication. Among changes introduced were a revitalized and rebranded music section titled B Side, an improvement in the paper&#x27;s advertising design, quality glossy paper stock for covers and key inside spreads, and editorial destinations shepherded primarily by new editor Mara Shalhoup. A post-redesign checkup several months later revealed a robust page count, innovations in social media and reader engagement, and strong commitment from advertisers.

&quot;The Straight Dope&quot;, by the pseudonymous Cecil Adams, was the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;&#x27;s first weekly column and one of the first features to be widely syndicated in the alternative press, at one time appearing in 35 papers. It was started on 2 February 1973 by Michael Lenehan and later written by Dave Kehr. In 1978 it was taken over by Ed Zotti, who continued to serve as Cecil&#x27;s &quot;assistant&quot; as of January 2010. In 1984, Chicago Review Press published &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;, a compilation of columns; the cover named Cecil Adams as author and Zotti as editor. The title was picked up and republished by Ballantine, which published four more volumes between 1988 and 1999. In 1996, The Straight Dope became a user area on AOL; a short-lived TV series, produced by Andrew Rosen, on the A&amp;E Network; and a Web site, Straightdope.com, which was named one of &quot;PC Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Top 101 Web Sites and as of January 2010 was drawing nearly 1.2 million users per month.

The &quot;Los Angeles Reader&quot; began publishing in 1978 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Chicago Reader, Inc. It was the first newspaper to publish Matt Groening&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Life in Hell&quot; and David Lynch&#x27;s strip &quot;The Angriest Dog in the World.&quot; Groening worked at the &quot;Los Angeles Reader&quot; for six years, first in circulation and then as a critic and assistant editor. In 1989, the paper was sold to a company headed by its founding editor, James Vowell. In 1996, it was sold to and closed by New Times Media, which later became Village Voice Media.

The &quot;San Diego Reader&quot; was founded in 1972 by Jim Holman, one of the original group who established the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. Although Holman briefly owned shares in the Chicago paper, none of the Chicago owners had an interest in the San Diego paper. Holman used the &quot;Reader&quot; format and nameplate with the blessings of his friends in Chicago.

Various other &quot;Reader&quot;s have been published, but the San Diego and Los Angeles papers are the only ones affiliated with the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. In the late 1970s, Chicago Reader, Inc. (CRI) sued the &quot;Twin Cities Reader&quot; for trademark infringement, arguing that the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; had given special meaning to the name &quot;Reader&quot;. The federal appeals court ultimately ruled that the term was &quot;merely descriptive&quot; and thus could not be protected as a trademark.

The &quot;East Bay Express&quot;, which serves the San Francisco Bay area, was co-founded in 1978 by Nancy Banks, a co-founder of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, and editor John Raeside. &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; owners invested in the paper and eventually CRI held a major stake. The paper was sold in 2001 to New Times Media, which became Village Voice Media and in 2007 sold it to editor Stephen Buel and a group of investors.

&quot;Washington City Paper&quot; was founded in 1981 by Russ Smith and Alan Hirsch, who had founded &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot; in 1977. Originally named &quot;1981&quot;, the name was changed the following year. Owners of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; invested in the Washington paper in 1982 and eventually controlled 100 percent of the stock. In 2007, they sold their interest in both papers to Creative Loafing, Inc.

&quot;The Reader&#x27;s Guide to Arts &amp; Entertainment&quot; was published as a suburban extension of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; in 1996. Before then, the &quot;Reader&quot; had avoided distribution in all but the closest suburbs of Chicago. &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Guide&quot; was a scaled-down version of the &quot;Reader&quot;, printed as a one-section tabloid meant to satisfy suburban demand for &quot;Reader&quot; content and advertising. In 2007, it was closed and distribution of the complete &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; was expanded to the suburbs.

The Ruxton Group, originally called the Reader Group, was formed by CRI in 1984 as a national advertising representative for the &quot;Reader&quot;, &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;, and other large-market alternative weeklies. In 1995 the company was sold to New Times Media, which became Village Voice Media and renamed Ruxton as the Voice Media Group.

Index Newspapers is the company that publishes &quot;The Stranger&quot; in Seattle, Washington, and the &quot;Portland Mercury&quot; in Portland, Oregon. In 2002, CRI invested in Index and took a minority interest.

Quarterfold, Inc. is a company formed by most of the former owners of Chicago Reader, Inc. to succeed that company and hold assets that were not included in the sale to Creative Loafing. Quarterfold&#x27;s chief asset is its ownership interest in Index Newspapers.

&quot;Amsterdam Weekly&quot; was a free, English-language weekly published in the Netherlands from May 2004 through December 2008. , it exists in limited form online. The paper was started by Todd Savage, who had been a writer and typesetter for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; in the late 1990s. The &quot;Reader&quot; was a major investor. In 2008, the paper was sold to Yuval Sigler, publisher of &quot;Time Out Tel Aviv&quot;, who with assets and staff including Savage launched &quot;Time Out Amsterdam&quot; in October 2008.

<text>The Ford Aerospace AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack is an electro-optical targeting pod for military attack aircraft. It uses a laser and a forward looking infrared to find and designate targets for laser-guided bombs and other precision-guided munitions. Pave Tack&#x27;s images are routed to a cockpit display, usually for the weapon systems officer.

==History==
Pave Tack was developed in the late 1970s and entered service in 1982, and was initially used by the USAF McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and General Dynamics F-111C Aardvark strike aircraft. Its combat debut came in 1986 during Operation El Dorado Canyon&#x27;s air raid against Libya by F-111F aircraft stationed at RAF Lakenheath, England. F-111s used it to great effect in the Gulf War of 1991, both against fixed targets and against tanks.

F-4 crews called Pave Tack &quot;Pave Drag&quot; because it was carried externally. Pave Tack is a large installation, with the pod alone weighing some 1,385 lb (629 kg) and measuring 166 inches (4,220 mm) in length. On the F-4, the size of the pod meant that it had to be carried on the centerline station in place of the standard drop tank; it imposed a substantial aerodynamic drag penalty and was generally unpopular. The F-111C and F-111F carried the Pave Tack pod on a rotating carriage in its internal bomb bay, retracting it when not in use to reduce drag and protect the sensors from damage.

About 150 AVQ-26 pods were built, substantially fewer than originally planned. The last USAF Pave Tacks were withdrawn with the retirement of the F-111 in 1996.

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) purchased ten Pave Tack pods in 1980 for its F-111 fleet. All 24 F-111Cs were wired for the pod, although there were not enough pods for all to be simultaneously equipped. Following the retirement of the USAF&#x27;s F-111F in 1996 the RAAF purchased surplus pods to equip each of its F-111Cs to carry its own.

The Republic of Korea Air Force (RoKAF) ordered an initial batch of eight pods in 1984 for delivery in 1987. It may have subsequently obtained additional pods from USAF surplus. The RoKAF uses the pods on its F-4 Phantoms.

<doc id="1071636" wikidata="Q1411232" url="?curid=1071636" title="Fuel tank">
<text>A fuel tank (also called a petrol tank or gas tank) is a safe container for flammable fluids, often gasoline or diesel fuel. Though any storage tank for fuel may be so called, the term is typically applied to part of an engine system in which the fuel is stored and propelled (fuel pump) or released (pressurized gas) into an engine. Fuel tanks range in size and complexity from the small plastic tank of a butane lighter to the multi-chambered cryogenic Space Shuttle external tank.


== Uses ==
Typically, a fuel tank must allow or provide the following:

* Storage of fuel: the system must contain a given quantity of fuel and must avoid leakage and limit evaporative emissions.
* Filling: the fuel tank must be filled in a secure way, without sparks.
* Provide a method for determining level of fuel in tank, gauging (the remaining quantity of fuel in the tank must be measured or evaluated).
* Venting (if over-pressure is not allowed, the fuel vapors must be managed through valves).
* Feeding of the engine (through a pump).
* Anticipate potentials for damage and provide safe survival potential.

Plastic (high-density polyethylene HDPE) as a fuel tank material of construction, while functionally viable in the short term, has a long term potential to become saturated as fuels such as diesel and gasoline permeate the HDPE material.

Considering the inertia and kinetic energy of fuel in a plastic tank being transported by a vehicle, environmental stress cracking is a definite potential. The flammability of fuel makes stress cracking a possible cause of catastrophic failure. Emergencies aside, HDPE plastic is suitable for short term storage of diesel and gasoline. In the U.S., Underwriters Laboratories approved (UL 142) tanks would be a minimum design consideration.

== Fuel tank construction ==
While most tanks are manufactured, some fuel tanks are still fabricated by metal craftsmen or hand-made in the case of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive, aircraft, motorcycles, boats and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank are
addressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks&#x27; baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added at the end of the fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.

In the aerospace industry, the use of Fuel Tank Sealants is a common application for high temperature integral fuel tanks. This provides excellent resistance to fluids such as water, alcohols, synthetic oils and petroleum-based hydraulic fluids.

== Automotive fuel tanks ==


=== Passenger vehicles ===
A larger fuel-tank results in a greater range for the car between refills, however the weight and space requirements of a larger tank are undesirable, especially in smaller cars. The average fuel tank capacity for cars is .

The most common materials for fuel tanks are metal or plastic. Metal (steel or aluminium) fuel tanks are usually built by welding stamped sheetmetal parts together. Plastic fuel tanks usually built using blow molding, which allows more complex shapes to be used.

Some vehicles include a smaller &quot;reserve tank&quot; to be used when the main fuel tank is empty. Some other vehicles, typically 4WD vehicles, have a large secondary tank (or &quot;sub-tank&quot;) to increase the range of the vehicle.

=== Racing fuel cell ===

A &quot;racing fuel cell&quot; has a rigid outer shell and flexible inner lining to minimize the potential for punctures in the event of a collision or other mishap resulting in serious damage to the vehicle. It is filled with an open-cell foam core to prevent explosion of vapor in the empty portion of the tank and to minimize sloshing of fuel during competition that may unbalance the vehicle or cause inadequate fuel delivery to the motor (fuel starvation).
=== Ship in a bottle ===
The &quot;ship in a bottle&quot; fuel tank is a manufacturing design developed by TI Automotive in Rastatt, Germany wherein all fuel delivery components including the pump, control electronics and most hosing are encased within a blow-molded plastic fuel tank, and named after the traditional ship-in-a-bottle mechanical puzzle. The technique was developed to reduce fuel vapor emissions in response to Partial Zero-Emission Vehicle (PZEV) requirements.

==Aircraft==


Aircraft typically use three types of fuel tanks: integral, rigid removable, and bladder.

* Integral tanks are areas inside the aircraft structure that have been sealed to allow fuel storage. An example of this type is the &quot;wet wing&quot; commonly used in larger aircraft. Since these tanks are part of the aircraft structure, they cannot be removed for service or inspection. Inspection panels must be provided to allow internal inspection, repair, and overall servicing of the tank. Most large transport aircraft use this system, storing fuel in the wings, belly, and sometimes tail of the airplane.
* Rigid removable tanks are installed in a compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of metal construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These tanks are commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the Cessna 172.
* Bladder tanks, or fuel cells, are reinforced rubberized bags installed in a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate the weight of the fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. One major plus side is the ability to use as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel.
* Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use self-sealing fuel tanks.

Fuel tanks have been implicated in aviation disasters, being the cause of the accident or worsening it (fuel tank explosion). For example:

* The official &quot;probable cause&quot; for the explosion and subsequent crash of TWA Flight 800 is that an explosive fuel/air mixture existed in one of the aircraft&#x27;s fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an ignition source within the tank, destroying the airliner. While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a fuel tank inerting system or fire-fighting foam in the tanks.
* Burning fuel can explode or set fire to the same airplane or adjacent objects and people. In the 1960 Munich Convair 340 crash, a transport crashed into a major street. Burning fuel set fire to a tramcar. All 20 people aboard the plane and 32 passengers of the tram died.

In some areas, an aircraft&#x27;s fuel tank is also referred to as an &quot;aircraft fuel cell&quot;.

== Water supply ==
Water supply systems can have primary or backup power supplied by diesel-fueled generators fed by a small &quot;day tank&quot; and a much larger bulk storage fuel tank.

== Safety ==
Proper design and construction of a fuel tank play a major role in the safety of the system of which the tank is a part. In most cases intact fuel tanks are very safe, as the tank is full of fuel vapour/air mixture that is well above the flammability limits, and thus cannot burn even if an ignition source were present (which is rare).

Bunded oil tanks are used for safely storing domestic heating oil and other hazardous materials. Bunding is often required by insurance companies, rather than single skinned oil storage tanks.

Several systems, such as BattleJacket and rubber bladders, have been developed and deployed for use in protecting (from explosion caused by enemy fire) the fuel tanks of military vehicles in conflict zones.

For stationary fuel tanks, an economical way to protect them from hazards like extremes of temperature and vehicle crashes is to bury them. However, buried tanks are difficult to monitor for leaks. This has led to concern about environmental hazards of underground storage tanks.

Electrostatic discharges in the vicinity of a fuel tank which is being filled may cause a fire or even an explosion. This risk can be mitigated by a vapor recovery system that reduces the concentration of flammable vapors released during refueling. It can also be mitigated by reducing the risk of an electrostatic discharge at a refueling station.
