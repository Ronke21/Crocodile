<text>Orson Hyde (January 8, 1805 – November 28, 1878) was a leader in the early Latter Day Saint movement and a member of the first Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He was the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 to 1875 and was a missionary of the LDS Church in the United States, Europe, and the Ottoman Empire.

==Early life==
Hyde was born on January 8, 1805, in Oxford, Connecticut, to Nathan Hyde and Sally Thorpe. His father served in the War of 1812. His mother died when he was seven years old, and Hyde and his eleven siblings were &quot;scattered among several foster parents.&quot; In 1812, he moved to Derby, Connecticut, where he was raised under the care of Nathan Wheeler. When he was 14 years old, Hyde walked from Derby, Connecticut to Kirtland, Ohio, where he settled with Wheeler. He was employed as a retail clerk in Kirtland. Hyde joined the local Methodist church in 1827, and then later affiliated with the Reformed Baptist Society (later Disciples of Christ or Campbellites). He was a Campbellite pastor in Mentor, Ohio, in 1830.

==Church membership and service==
When Oliver Cowdery and other Latter Day Saint missionaries preached in Kirtland in late 1830, Hyde spoke publicly against the Book of Mormon. However, when his former minister, Sidney Rigdon, joined the Church of Christ, Hyde investigated the claims of the missionaries and was baptized by Rigdon in October 1831. Rigdon and Joseph Smith ordained him as an elder later that month, and Oliver Cowdery ordained him as a high priest on the 26th of October. Hyde was called and appointed to serve on a succession of missions for the church, serving alongside Hyrum Smith, Samuel H. Smith, and John Gould. His first mission call was extended in November 1831 to preach the gospel in Orange, Ohio then he was again called in January 1832 to go with Samuel H. Smith to &quot;take their journey into the eastern countries and proclaim&quot; the gospel to the inhabitants there. His mission proved successful as he baptized many during his time in the eastern states, which included Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts. During one trip, Hyde traveled about on foot between New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine. He discussed his new faith with his old Campbellite acquaintances during these missions.

Hyde was present for the founding of the School of the Prophets in 1833. He then marched with Zion&#x27;s Camp in 1834 and became one of the members of the first presiding high council in Kirtland, Ohio. He was ordained an apostle of the church on February 15, 1835, as one of the original Quorum of the Twelve, being fifth in seniority. David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and Martin Harris performed Hyde&#x27;s ordination. After becoming an apostle, Hyde served additional missions to Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, and Canada. He also embarked on a mission with Heber C. Kimball to Great Britain in 1837, returning home in 1838. Their efforts were successful in bringing approximately 1,500 converts to the faith.

Upon returning from Britain, Hyde found the church in a period of persecution and internal dissension. He traveled to Missouri where he fell sick enough to be bed-bound. Thomas B. Marsh and his family took Hyde in and cared for him away from the violence surrounding rest of the church members and, as they did, a grudge they had against the church poisoned his perspective. Marsh then swore out an affidavit before the justice of the peace of Ray County, Missouri saying that the Latter-day Saints there had organized a vigilante group, &quot;who have taken an oath to support the heads of the church in all things that they say or do, whether right or wrong;&quot; that church vigilantes had burned and looted non-Mormon settlements in Daviess County; and that:

Bed-bound, sick and isolated, Hyde swore before the same justice on the same day that he either knew Marsh&#x27;s statements to be true or believed them to be such. 

Because he had signed the Richmond affidavit with Marsh, Hyde was disfellowshipped (disciplined, but not removed from membership) in 1838. On May 4, 1839, he was removed from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The church leadership invited Hyde to explain his actions. On June 27, Hyde returned to the church and publicly explained himself, recanting his affidavit and asking to be restored. He was readmitted into the Quorum the same day in Nauvoo, Illinois.
==Mission to Jerusalem==
As early as 1832, when he was a newly baptized member of the church eager to know the will of the Lord, Hyde sought direction from Joseph Smith, whom he considered to be a prophet. In a blessing Hyde received in 1832 at the hands of Smith, Hyde was told, “Thou shalt go to Jerusalem . . . and be a watchman unto the house of Israel; and by thy hands shall the Most High do a good work, which shall prepare the way, and greatly facilitate the gathering together of that people.”

Eight years after receiving this blessing, Orson Hyde had a vision in March 1840 in which the Spirit told him he was to visit the cities of London, Amsterdam, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, and that in Jerusalem he was to declare to those of Judah that they must &quot;gather together,&quot; &quot;assemble yourselves,&quot; and &quot;go into the defenced cities.&quot; One month after this vision, on April 6, 1840, Orson Hyde spoke at a church general conference in Nauvoo, Illinois. In his address, Hyde said that “it had been prophesied, some years ago [referring to his 1832 blessing], that he had a great work to perform among the Jews; and that he had recently been moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord to visit that people.” When Hyde concluded speaking, Joseph Smith motioned to those in attendance at the conference and resolved that Hyde should proceed on a mission to Jerusalem. This Hyde did with a prayer on October 24, 1841, in which he dedicated the Holy Land for the return of the Jews.

According to the minutes from the April 6, 1840 general conference, at which Hyde was dispatched, &quot;Elder John E. Page then rose, and spoke with much force on the subject of Elder Hyde’s mission,&quot; and on the last day of the conference, Joseph Smith “stated that since Elder Hyde had been appointed to visit the Jews, he had felt an impression that it would be well for Elder John E. Page to accompany him on his mission.” The two elders, Hyde and Page, left Nauvoo and embarked on their mission on 15 April 1840. For the following months, Hyde and Page traveled as circumstances allowed, sometimes together and at other times apart. In the end, however, Page &quot;failed to accompany him&quot; all the way to Jerusalem. They parted ways when Hyde waited for Page in New York City for several months, but Page never arrived, so Hyde set out for Jerusalem alone, as he had foreseen in his vision.

His letter of introduction claimed that &quot;The Jewish nations have been scattered abroad among the Gentiles for a long period; and in our estimation, the time of the commencement of their return to the Holy Land has already arrived.&quot; He left the United States and traveled through Germany, the Ottoman Empire, and Egypt before arriving in Jerusalem. He stayed in Bavaria for a while to learn the German language.

Hyde was only in Jerusalem for a few days. He arrived there on Thursday, October 21, 1841, and stayed until Monday, October 25, 1841. He recorded that before dawn on October 24, 1841, he climbed up the Mount of Olives overlooking the city, then both wrote and recited a prayer, part of which reads:Now, O Lord! Thy servant has been obedient to the heavenly vision which Thou gavest him in his native land; and under the shadow of Thine outstretched arm, he has safely arrived in this place to dedicate and consecrate this land unto Thee, for the gathering together of Judah&#x27;s scattered remnants, according to the predictions of the holy Prophets -- for the building up of Jerusalem again after it has been trodden down by the Gentiles so long, and for rearing a Temple in honor of Thy name. Everlasting thanks be ascribed unto Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast preserved Thy servant from the dangers of the seas, and from the plague and pestilence which have caused the land to mourn. The violence of man has also been restrained, and Thy providential care by night and by day has been exercised over Thine unworthy servant. Accept, therefore, O Lord, the tribute of a grateful heart for all past favors, and be pleased to continue Thy kindness and mercy towards a needy worm of the dust. Having dedicated Jerusalem for the gathering of the Jews, Hyde departed the mountain after building a small altar with stones. Nearly a year later, Orson Hyde returned to America. He traveled back by way of Regensburg, Germany where he spent a number of months working on a church publication in German. He finally arrived home to his wife and two daughters in Nauvoo on December 7, 1842, having been gone for a few months shy of three years.

Since Orson Hyde&#x27;s dedicatory mission, the Holy Land has been &quot;formally dedicated for the return of Judah and the house of Israel in at least ten other dedicatory prayers.&quot;

The Orson Hyde Memorial Garden on the Mount of Olives was dedicated in 1979. The park was funded by donations to the Orson Hyde Foundation through the Jerusalem Foundation. The sign at the front of the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden was created by the Israeli government; however, it contains several mistakes that are common misconceptions about Hyde&#x27;s mission to Jerusalem: 1) Unlike most other missions, Hyde was not called to preach the gospel in Jerusalem but to dedicate the land for the gathering of Judah, and 2) Hyde was only in Jerusalem for several days, although it is true that he was traveling to and from Jerusalem during the years 1841–1842.

==Family life==

Hyde married Marinda Nancy Johnson, in Kirtland, Ohio, on September 4, 1834. Joseph Smith was sealed to Marinda as a plural wife either in April 1842, or in May 1843. Marinda signed an affidavit saying that her sealing to Joseph Smith occurred in May 1843. However, one of Smith&#x27;s scribes, Thomas Bullock, later wrote a list of plural marriage dates in the back of one of Smith&#x27;s journals and noted a sealing date of April 1842. It is not clear when or if Hyde learned about his wife&#x27;s sealing to Smith, however, John D. Lee, in his book &quot;Mormonism Unveiled,&quot; reported that Hyde may have given his consent. Three months after his return from his mission, Hyde learned about plural marriage and married two additional wives. He ultimately took eight wives and fathered 32 children. He and Johnson divorced in 1870.

==Later life==
Hyde served on the Nauvoo City Council from 1843 to 1845 and joined the Council of Fifty on March 13, 1844. After Joseph Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, he oversaw the completion of the Nauvoo Temple, which was dedicated in 1846, just before the church members left for Iowa territory. He moved with them to the staging grounds at Council Bluffs, Iowa, for their trek west and to oversaw their emigration to Utah. He then was sent to England, presiding over the British Mission from 1846 to 1847. During this trip, he also served as editor of the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;, the Latter-day Saint publication in England. Upon his return to the United States, he became President of the Quorum of the Twelve in 1847. Hyde was placed in charge of the church in the Midwest, remaining in Council Bluffs, Iowa, until 1852. He published the &quot;Frontier Guardian&quot; in Council Bluffs. He then joined the main body of the church in Utah Territory in 1852.

Hyde served as an associate judge for Utah Territory for the U.S. Supreme Court beginning in 1852. During the settlement of the territory, Brigham Young called Hyde to lead settlement groups to Carson Valley, Nevada, and the Sanpete–Sevier District in Utah. He also led an expedition to the Green River in 1853. Hyde was a member of the Manti Temple Building Committee and the Utah Territorial Assembly until he was sent to settle Spring City, Utah.

When dealing with the question of seniority in the council in 1875, long after the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young ruled that, if a council member had been disciplined and removed from the council, his seniority was based on the date of readmission. By this ruling, in June 1875, both Hyde and apostle Orson Pratt were moved down in quorum seniority. So, when Hyde repented in 1839, he effectively joined the quorum as a new member. As a result of this ruling, John Taylor replaced Hyde as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1875.

==Death and legacy==
Hyde died in Spring City on November 28, 1878 at 72 years of age. He was succeeded by Moses Thatcher in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He is buried at Spring City. Hyde is mentioned by name in six sections of the Doctrine and Covenants: sections 68, 75, 100, 102, 103, and 124. In his &quot;Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia&quot;, Andrew Jenson describes Hyde as &quot;a man of great natural ability, and by industrious application had acquired a good education, which, with his great and varied experience and extended travels, rendered him a powerful instrument in the hands of God for the defense and dissemination of the gospel and the building up of the Latter-day Work.&quot;

<text>New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) was an agency of the Government of New South Wales that administered rail transport in the colony, and then the state, of New South Wales, Australia, between 1855 and 1932.

==History==
The NSWGR built its entire route network to standard gauge. Its first line, also the first railway of New South Wales, was the railway line from Sydney to Parramatta (today: Granville railway station) completed in 1855.

The agency was managed by a range of different commission structures between 1857 and 1932, which reported to either the Minister for Public Works or the Minister for Transport.

The inaugural Chief Commissioner was Ben Martindale and, following the enactment of the he became Commissioner of Railways. John Rae succeeded Martindale in 1861, and in 1877 Charles Goodchap was appointed Commissioner. The set up a corporate body of three railway commissioners to manage the railways and remove them from political influence, resulting in the resignation of Goodchap.

This Board of Railway Commissioners of New South Wales was in place from 22 October 1888 to 4 April 1907, and was replaced by a sole Chief Commissioner of Railways and Tramways until 22 March 1932, when a panel arrangement was restored for a period of nine months, with the Transport Commissioners of New South Wales. On 29 December 1932, the Department of Railways New South Wales was established and Thomas Joseph Hartigan was appointed Commissioner for Railways replacing the functions of the Chief Transport Commissioner. The Department of Railways New South Wales become the official name of the railway and was used on most documentation (drawings &amp; other paperwork), the NSWGR title was still used periodically on public documentation such as advertising and timetables. This continued until the creation of the Public Transport Commission on 20 October 1972. The last Commissioner for Railways was Neil McCusker.

==Legacy==
The agency was succeeded by the Department of Railways on 1 January 1915; and then following the enactment of the , the Public Transport Commission was formed; later to become the State Rail Authority on 1 July 1980. Further restructures in 1996, 2001 and 2003 resulted in the establishment of the RailCorp, the agency currently responsible for the Sydney suburban and interurban rail network and rural passenger services, and for providing government and commercial freight operators with access to the rails of the Sydney metropolitan area. On 1 July 2013, the operational responsibilities of RailCorp were transferred to NSW TrainLink and Sydney Trains.

==Infrastructure==
The agency built all of their track to the and ran its first official passenger train on 26 September 1855, between the Sydney terminal (just south of the current ) and Parramatta junction (just past Granville) railway stations.

The agency was also a significant electricity generator. It operated several power stations, notably at Ultimo, White Bay, Lithgow, and Zaara Street, Newcastle, until its generation and transmission assets were taken over by the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, on 1 January 1953.

==Rolling stock==
In 1936, the company owned 1187 locomotives, 457 railcars, 1445 coaches, 172 brake vans and 22,068 goods wagons.

<text>Proposition 60 was an amendment of the Constitution of California, enacted in 2004, guaranteeing the right of a party participating in a primary election to also participate in the general election that follows. It was proposed by the California Legislature and approved by the voters in referendum held as part of the November 2004 election, by a majority of 67%.
==Provisions==

Proposition 60 related to partisan primary elections for statewide offices, as well as races for the state legislature, and the State Board of Equalization. It added to the state constitution Article II, Section 5 (b), stating that

The official summary of the proposition stated

It was declared by the Legislative Analyst to have &quot;no fiscal effect&quot;.

==Process of enactment==

In 2004 the state legislature proposed a constitutional amendment called Senate Constitutional Amendment 18. This contained provisions relating to both primary elections and funds from the sale of government property. This was to be put to voters as a single measure called Proposition 60. However Californians for an Open Primary challenged the measure as a violation of the rule that ballot propositions must deal with only a single subject. The group wished to have Proposition 60 removed from the ballot. Instead, in &quot;Californians for an Open Primary v. Shelley&quot;, the Third District Court of Appeals ordered that the proposition be split, so that the provisions relating to government property would become a separate measure, called Proposition 60A.

Proposition 60 (including the provisions later excised) was approved by the California State Senate by a vote of 28-3 and by the State Assembly by a by 55–21. On November 2, 2004, it was approved by voters by a majority of 5,806,708 (67.3%) &quot;Yes&quot; votes, to 2,829,284 (32.7%) &quot;No&quot; votes. Proposition 60A was also approved by voters.

<text>Silmarils was a French computer game software company founded in 1987 by Louis-Marie and André Rocques. It produced games for PC, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Macintosh, Atari ST and Atari Falcon.

The company is most closely associated with its &quot;Ishar&quot; series. &quot;Crystals of Arborea&quot; was one of the first games to feature a real-time 3D environment and a large world with very few limits on movement. The company went bankrupt in 2003, and in 2004 the Rocques brothers and another former Silmarils member, Pascal Einsweiler, founded a new studio called Eversim, specializing in political strategy games.

The company was named after J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Silmarils.

<doc id="1072812" wikidata="Q7968163" url="?curid=1072812" title="Wanted Dead or Alive (Warren Zevon album)">
<text>Wanted Dead or Alive is the debut studio album by singer-songwriter Warren Zevon. The album released by Liberty Records in 1970 under the moniker &quot;Zevon&quot;.

==Production==
Kim Fowley began the project as producer, but left after disagreements with Zevon and did not take credit for production duties. Fowley later remembered:

[Warren] wanted to play all the instruments himself. He wouldn&#x27;t listen to anybody. I wasn&#x27;t trying to produce him because you really couldn&#x27;t produce Warren, at least not in those days, but I was trying to help him make a record that might sell more than ten copies, all purchased by his friends. But, he didn&#x27;t listen to anyone about anything, and one day I just walked in thinking I&#x27;d had enough.

Zevon chalked up his disagreement with Fowley to a &quot;sudden attack of taste&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; was a commercial and critical failure. The album was released &quot;to the sound of one hand clapping&quot;, as Zevon later remarked. Sales were poor, and critics ignored the album. Jackson Browne later commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember thinking [the album] was as good as he really was.&quot; Attempts to record a follow-up album, called &quot;Leaf in the Wind&quot;, were abandoned, and Zevon found work as band leader and musical coordinator for The Everly Brothers. His next album, the critically acclaimed classic &quot;Warren Zevon&quot;, was not released until 1976. Once Zevon reached stardom, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; ended up as an all-but-forgotten relic of his early career.

==Re-release==
&quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; was initially released on CD by One Way Records in 1996. Following the announcement that Zevon had terminal lung cancer, Capitol Records put out a remastered version of the album in early 2003, which was initially intended to have the entirety of &quot;Leaf in the Wind&quot;, but those plans were scrapped at the last minute for unknown reasons.

==Legacy==
The track &quot;She Quit Me&quot; was featured in the 1969 film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (performed by Lesley Miller) as &quot;He Quit Me&quot;. &quot;Tule&#x27;s Blues&quot; was written about Zevon&#x27;s lover, Marilyn &quot;Tule&quot; Livingston, mother of his son Jordan. It was covered in 1972 as a single by the group Sugarblu on Warner Bros. Records.

<text>Hyrum Mack Smith (March 21, 1872 – January 23, 1918) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

Smith was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, the eldest son of church apostle and future church president Joseph F. Smith and Edna Lambson. Smith was named after his paternal grandfather Hyrum Smith, who was the elder brother of LDS Church founder Joseph Smith and a prominent leader of the early church.

Smith attended Latter-day Saint College, from which he graduated in 1894. On November 15, 1895, he married Ida Elizabeth Bowman and the next day left her behind in Utah to serve a mission in Great Britain. From October 1896 until February 1898, Smith presided over the Newcastle Conference.

After returning from his mission, Smith worked at ZCMI while also serving as a part-time missionary in Salt Lake City.

Smith was ordained an apostle of the church on October 24, 1901, at the age of 29, by his father, who was president of the church. In 1909 Smith was assigned as one of the original two priesthood advisors to the Church wide Primary Association.

In 1913, Smith was called as the president of the European Mission of the church. He served in this capacity until 1916, when the activities of the mission were suspended due to World War I.

Smith and his wife had five children, one of whom was Joseph Fielding Smith, who became presiding patriarch of the church. Another of Smith&#x27;s children was Geraldine Smith, the mother of M. Russell Ballard, an apostle of the LDS Church.

Smith wrote a commentary on the Doctrine and Covenants with Janne M. Sjödahl.

Smith died in Salt Lake City from a ruptured appendix on January 23, 1918, at the age of 45. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. His wife Ida was pregnant with their fifth child, Hyrum, and died from complications with childbirth in September 1918. The deaths of Hyrum Mack and Ida were among the contributing factors that led to the revelation of Church President (and Hyrum&#x27;s father) Joseph F. Smith in October 1918 on the spirits of the dead, which became section 138 of the Doctrine and Covenants.

<text>The boomslang ( or ; Dispholidus typus) is a highly venomous snake in the family Colubridae. The species is native to Sub-Saharan Africa.

==Etymology==
Its common name means &quot;tree snake&quot; in Dutch and Afrikaans – &quot;boom&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot;, and &quot;slang&quot; meaning &quot;snake&quot;. In Afrikaans, the name is pronounced . 

==Taxonomy==
The boomslang is a colubrid snake within the subfamily Colubrinae. It belongs to the genus &quot;Dispholidus&quot;, which contains two other species, &quot;D. pembae&quot; and &quot;D. punctatus&quot;.

The boomslang is thought to be closely related to members of the genera &quot;Thelotornis&quot;, &quot;Thrasops&quot;, &quot;Rhamnophis&quot;, and &quot;Xyelodontophis&quot;, with which it forms the taxonomic tribe Dispholidini.

Close relationships can be shown in the cladogram below:
===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognised, including the nominotypical subspecies.

* &quot;D. t. kivuensis&quot; 
* &quot;D. t. typus&quot; 

The trinomial authority in parentheses for &quot;D. t. typus&quot; indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Dispholidus&quot;.

==Description==
The average adult boomslang is in total length (including tail). Some exceed . The eyes are exceptionally large, and the head has a characteristic egg-like shape. Colouration is highly variable. Males are light green with black or blue scale edges, but adult females may be brown demonstrating sexual dimorphism.

Weight varies from , with an average weight of .

In this species, the head is distinct from the neck and the canthus rostralis is distinct. The pupil of the very large eye is round. The boomslang has excellent eyesight and often moves its head from side to side to get a better view of objects directly in front. The maxillary teeth are small anteriorly, seven or eight in number, followed by three very large, grooved fangs situated below each eye. The mandibular teeth are subequal. The body is slightly compressed. The dorsal scales, which are arranged in 19 or 21 rows, are very narrow, oblique, strongly keeled, with apical pits. The tail is long, and the subcaudal scales are paired. Ventral scales are 164–201; the anal plate is divided; and the subcaudals are 91–131.

==Geographic range==
The boomslang is endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa, from The Gambia, Guinea, Senegal and most of Western Africa (including Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo) through Central and Eastern Africa (Democratic Republic of the Congo, western Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda). It is found across much of Southern Africa, in a wide array of habitats, with some of the species&#x27; densest populations being in Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

==Habitat==
The boomslang is an excellent climber and is highly arboreal, living mainly in forested areas. &quot;D. typus&quot; lives in karoo shrubs, savannahs, lowland forests, and in grasslands. The boomslang is not restricted to trees and can often be found on the ground hunting, feeding, or taking shelter. It will occasionally hide underground when the weather is harsh.

==Reproduction==
The boomslang is oviparous, and an adult female can produce up to 30 eggs, which are deposited in a hollow tree trunk or rotting log. The eggs have a relatively long (3 months on average) incubation period. Male hatchlings are grey with blue speckles, and female hatchlings are pale brown. They attain their adult colouration after several years. Hatchlings are about in length and pose no threat to humans, but are dangerously venomous by the time they reach a length around and a girth as thick as an adult&#x27;s smallest finger.

==Behaviour and diet==

&quot;D. typus&quot; is diurnal and almost exclusively arboreal. It is reclusive, and moves from branch to branch when pursued by anything too large to eat. Its diet includes chameleons and other arboreal lizards, frogs, and occasionally small mammals, birds, and eggs from nesting birds and reptiles, all of which it swallows whole. The boomslang will also feed on other snakes, including cannibalising members of its own species. During cool weather, the boomslang brumates for short periods, often curling up inside the enclosed nest of a weaverbird.

==Venom==
Many venomous species of the Colubridae are harmless to humans—unless one has a known rare allergy—largely because of small venom glands and inefficient teeth that are situated at the back of the mouth. These species, including the boomslang, are collectively known as &quot;rear-fanged&quot; (or opisthoglyphous) snakes, as their venom-injecting teeth are situated farther back in the mouth than elapids or vipers, and thus require the snake to bite, hold-on, and &quot;chew&quot; the venom into its victim.

However, some opisthoglyphous snakes—including the boomslang—actually possess a highly potent and toxic venom. The boomslang is able to open its jaws up to 170° when biting, facilitating envenomation. The venom of the boomslang is primarily a hemotoxin; it works via a process in which many small clots form in the blood, causing the victim&#x27;s circulatory system to improperly coagulate, resulting in excessive bleeding and death. The venom has been observed to cause bleeding in tissues such as muscle and the brain (among other organs), while, at the same time, clogging capillaries with tiny blood clots. Other signs and symptoms include headache, nausea, sleepiness, and confusion, leading to cardiac arrest and unconsciousness.

Because boomslang venom is slow-acting, symptoms may not become apparent until many hours after a bite. Although the absence of symptoms provides sufficient time for procuring antivenom, it can also provide victims with false reassurances, leading to underestimation of the seriousness of the bite. Snakes of any species may sometimes fail to inject venom when they bite (a so-called &quot;dry bite&quot; or &quot;bluff strike&quot;, enacted in-defense), wherein, after a few hours without any noticeable effects, victims of boomslang bites may falsely believe that their attack was simply a dry or bluff strike. The pathophysiological mechanisms of the venom are different with every snake, resulting in different clinical manifestations with every patient. 

An adult boomslang has 1.6 to 8 mg of venom. Its median lethal dose (LD50) in mice is 0.1 mg/kg (intravenously). 0.071 mg/kg (IV) has also been reported. 12.5 mg/kg (subcutaneously) and 1.3–1.8 mg/kg (intraperitoneal). Based on the very low venom quantities produced by &quot;D. typus&quot;, and the very serious effects found in a good part of the reported cases in humans, it has been suggested that the venom&#x27;s LD50 is lower in humans than in mice, with only 2 to 3 mg being enough to potentially kill a healthy adult.

In 1957, herpetologist Karl Schmidt died after being bitten by a juvenile boomslang, which he had doubted could produce a fatal dose. He made notes on the symptoms he experienced almost to the end. D. S. Chapman reported eight serious envenomations by boomslangs between 1919 and 1962, two of which were lethal.

Boomslang monovalent antivenom was developed during the 1940s. The South African Vaccine Producers manufactures a monovalent antivenom for use in boomslang envenomations. Treatment of bites may also require complete blood transfusions, especially if over 24-48 hours have passed without antivenom.

The boomslang is a timid snake, and bites generally occur only when people attempt to handle, catch, pursue or kill the animal. When confronted and cornered, it inflates its neck and assumes an S-shaped striking pose, a key indicator of any snake species feeling threatened.

<text>Catherine Michelle Granato (born March 25, 1971) is an American former ice hockey player and one of the first women to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in November 2010. She currently works as an assistant general manager for the Vancouver Canucks organization. Granato was the captain of the U.S. women&#x27;s hockey team that won a gold medal in the 1998 Winter Olympics. She is the younger sister of former NHL player Tony Granato and former Buffalo Sabres head coach Don Granato, and a graduate of Providence College. Granato played hockey for Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Granato has been a recipient of the Lester Patrick Award (2007), and she has been inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame (2008), the US Hockey Hall of Fame (2008), the Hockey Hall of Fame (2010) and the Rhode Island Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018.

==USA Hockey==
Granato played in every world championship for the United States from the inaugural event in 1990 to 2005. She was named USA Women&#x27;s Player of the Year in 1996. Granato was the captain of the U.S. women&#x27;s hockey team that won a gold medal in the 1998 Winter Olympics. On February 8, 1998, she scored the first ever Olympic goal for the U.S women&#x27;s hockey team. In 205 career games for the national team, Granato had 186 goals, 157 assists, and 343 points. She is the team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer.

Granato was cut from the US National team unexpectedly before the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy bringing controversy to the decision after being a part of the program since its inaugural season and all-time leading point scorer. The US team subsequently lost its Olympic semifinal match to Sweden, its first-ever international loss to a team other than Canada, and brought home the bronze medal.

==Other teams==
Granato played hockey for Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In June 1997, New York Islanders general manager Mike Milbury extended an invitation to Granato to attend Islanders training camp. Granato eventually declined.

Granato played for the Vancouver Griffins (2001–02 and 2002–03), a professional women&#x27;s ice hockey team in the National Women&#x27;s Hockey League (NWHL).

==Later career==
Granato is also a rinkside reporter for NBC&#x27;s NHL coverage, and served as a color commentator for NBC&#x27;s coverage of women&#x27;s ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. In 1998, Granato served as the color commentator for Los Angeles Kings radio broadcasts.

She currently hosts the &quot;On the Bus With Cammi &amp; AJ&quot; podcast with former teammate A. J. Mleczko.

* On September 18, 2007, Granato was announced one of the four recipients of the 2007 Lester Patrick Trophy. She is a partner in BelaHockey, a company that creates hockey accessories for girls.
* In May 2008, Granato was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame with two other women&#x27;s hockey players (Geraldine Heaney and Angela James) - the first women to be given such an honor.
* On August 12, 2008, it was announced that Granato would be inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, the first woman to be in the Hall. The induction ceremony took place on October 10, 2008, at the University of Denver.
* On November 8, 2010 Granato was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Granato and Angela James were the first female inductees.
* On September 20, 2018, Granato was inducted into the Rhode Island Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Granato married former NHL star, Ray Ferraro, in 2004 and lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. They have two sons: Riley (born December 2006) and Reese (born December 2009). She is stepmother to Ferraro&#x27;s sons from his first marriage, Matt and Landon, an NHL draft pick of the Detroit Red Wings. She has four brothers (including Don and Tony) and one sister.

<doc id="1072851" wikidata="Q1642242" url="?curid=1072851" title="Ostrogski family">
<text>The House of Ostrogski (; ; ) was one of the more prominent families in the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The family spanned from the 14th century Ruthenian noble Daniil Ostrogski to the 17th century Polish members. After the death of Janusz Ostrogski, the last male heir, most of the family&#x27;s possessions passed to the Zasławski family.

The family played a crucial role in preserving the Eastern Orthodoxy, particularly during the Union of Brest signing in 1595. Members contributed to printing books in Church Slavonic (Kyiv [Ruthenian] recession) and supporting the Orthodox brotherhoods. By the 17th century almost all members turn to Catholicism and became fully associated with the Polish nation (Polonization). Many of their possessions were passed on or inherited by members of Sanguszko family.

==History==

The Ostrogski family was most likely of Rurikid stock and descended from Sviatopolk II of Kiev. Some scholars however claim that their descent is from the Galicia-Volhynia line of the Rurikid dynasty. Vasilko Romanovich (c.1256-1282), Prince of Slonim, may have been the grandfather of Prince Daniel Ostrogski. The probable progenitor of this family was Prince Danylo Dmytrovych (&quot;or Danylo Wasilijewicz&quot;), who received Ostroh from Liubartas, son of Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas. His son, Prince Feodor Danilovich Ostrogski, was a supporter of King Jagiello, who in 1386 confirmed him in possession of the Ostroh Castle and appointed governor of Volhynia in 1387. In addition to Ostrog Feodor Danilovich Ostrogski became owner of Korets, Zaslav (Izyaslav, in present Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Ukraine), and other towns. In some chronicles Feodor is called &quot;Dux Fethko de Ostrog&quot;.
Their dominions in Volynia, Galicia, and Podolia included 24 towns, 10 townlets, and more than 100 villages. 

The most notable among Feodor&#x27;s descendants was Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Prince Konstanty Ostrogski, who defeated Muscovy in the Battle of Orsha (1514) and his son Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski (or &quot;Konstantin Konstantinovich Ostrozhski&quot;). 
Unlike other Ruthenian magnates, the Ostrogskis refused to give up Eastern Orthodoxy for Roman Catholicism despite the cultural pressure that led to Polonization of Ruthenian nobility. For several generations the Ostrogskis supported the religion of their forefathers, by opening schools, printing books in Ruthenian language with Cyrillic such as &quot;Ostrog Bible&quot; (written by Ivan Fedorov) and making a generous charitable contributions to the construction of the Orthodox churches in the region.

The last male member of the family was Janusz Ostrogski (d. 1620); the last female was Anna Alojza Ostrogska (1600–54), married to Grand Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz. When a junior line of the family (princes Zasławski or Zasławski-Ostrogowski) which inherited the Ostrogoski fortune became extinct in 1682 (with the death of Aleksander Janusz Zasławski), their huge possessions passed to the Lubomirski family (due to their marriage with Aleksander sister, Teofilia Ludwika Zasławska) and other families of Polish szlachta. A complicated litigation concerning the Ostrogski inheritance continued until the Russian Empire annexed Poland during the Partitions.

<text>The Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) is &quot;a system of interconnected computer networks used by the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of State to transmit classified information (up to and including information classified SECRET) by packet switching over the &#x27;completely secure&#x27; environment&quot;. It also provides services such as hypertext document access and electronic mail. As such, SIPRNet is the DoD&#x27;s classified version of the civilian Internet.

SIPRNet is the secret component of the Defense Information Systems Network. Other components handle communications with other security needs, such as the NIPRNet, which is used for nonsecure communications, and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), which is used for Top Secret communications.

==Access==

According to the U.S. Department of State Web Development Handbook, domain structure and naming conventions are the same as for the open internet, except for the addition of a second-level domain, like, e.g., &quot;sgov&quot; between state and gov: openforum.state.sgov.gov. Files originating from SIPRNet are marked by a header tag &quot;SIPDIS&quot; (SIPrnet DIStribution). A corresponding second-level domain smil.mil exists for DoD users.

Access is also available to a &quot;...small pool of trusted allies, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand...&quot;. This group (including the US) is known as the Five Eyes.

SIPRNet was one of the networks accessed by Chelsea Manning, convicted of leaking the video used in WikiLeaks&#x27; &quot;Collateral Murder&quot; release as well as the source of the US diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks in November 2010.

==Alternate names==
SIPRNet and NIPRNet are referred to colloquially as &quot;SIPPERnet&quot; and &quot;NIPPERnet&quot; (or simply &quot;sipper&quot; and &quot;nipper&quot;), respectively.

<doc id="1072855" wikidata="Q2400211" url="?curid=1072855" title="Moorish Science Temple of America">
<text>The Moorish Science Temple of America is an American national and religious organization founded by Noble Drew Ali (born as Timothy Drew) in the early 20th century. He based it on the premise that African Americans are descendants of the Moabites and thus are &quot;Moorish&quot; by nationality, and Islamic by faith. Ali put together elements of major traditions to develop a message of personal transformation through historical education, racial pride, and spiritual uplift. His doctrine was also intended to provide African Americans with a sense of identity in the world and to promote civic involvement.

One primary tenet of the Moorish Science Temple is the belief that African Americans are of &quot;Moorish&quot; descent, specifically from the &quot;Moroccan Empire&quot;. According to Ali, this area included other countries around Northwest Africa. To join the movement, individuals had to proclaim their &quot;Moorish nationality&quot;. They were given &quot;nationality cards&quot;. In religious texts, adherents refer to themselves racially as &quot;Asiatics,&quot; as the Middle East is also Western Asia. Adherents of this movement are known as &quot;Moorish-American Moslems&quot; and are called &quot;Moorish Scientists&quot; in some circles.

The Moorish Science Temple of America was incorporated under the Illinois Religious Corporation Act 805 ILCS 110. Timothy Drew, known to its members as Prophet Noble Drew Ali, founded the Moorish Science Temple of America in 1913 in Newark, New Jersey, a booming industrial city. After some difficulties, Ali moved to Chicago, establishing a center there, as well as temples in other major cities. The movement expanded rapidly during the late 1920s. The quick expansion of the Moorish Science Temple arose in large part from the search for identity and context among black Americans at the time of the Great Migration to northern cities, as they were becoming an urbanized people.

Competing factions developed among the congregations and leaders, especially after the death of the charismatic Ali. Three independent organizations developed from this ferment. The founding of the Nation of Islam by Wallace Fard Muhammad in 1930 also created competition for members. In the 1930s, membership was estimated at 30,000, with one-third in Chicago. During the postwar years, the Moorish Science Temple of America continued to increase in membership, albeit at a slower rate.

==Biography of Drew==

Timothy Drew is believed to have been born on January 8, 1886, in North Carolina, United States. Sources differ as to his background and upbringing: one reports he was the son of two former slaves who was adopted by a tribe of Cherokee; another describes Drew as the son of a Moroccan Muslim father and a Cherokee mother. In 2014, an article in the online &quot;Journal of Race Ethnicity and Religion&quot; attempted to link Timothy Drew to one Thomas Drew, born January 8, 1886, using census records, a World War I draft card, and street directory records.

==Founding of the Moorish Science Temple==
Drew Ali reported that he met with a high priest of Egyptian magic during his travels. In one version of Drew Ali&#x27;s biography, the leader saw him as a reincarnation of the founder. In others, he says that the priest considered him a reincarnation of Jesus, the Buddha, Muhammad, and other religious prophets. According to the biography, the high priest trained Ali in mysticism and gave him a &quot;lost section&quot; of the Quran.

This text became known as the &quot;Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America&quot;. It is also known as the &quot;Circle Seven Koran&quot; because of its cover, which features a red &quot;7&quot; surrounded by a blue circle. The first 19 chapters are from &quot;The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ,&quot; published in 1908 by esoteric preacher and Ohioan Levi Dowling. In &quot;The Aquarian Gospel&quot;, Dowling described Jesus&#x27;s supposed travels in India, Egypt, and Palestine during the years of his life not accounted for by the New Testament.

Chapters 20 to 45 are adapted from the Rosicrucian work &quot;Unto Thee I Grant&quot;, featuring minor stylistic changes. They provide guidance on living, education, and the responsibilities of adherents.

Drew Ali wrote the last four chapters of the &quot;Circle Seven Koran&quot; himself. In these, he wrote:

Drew Ali and his followers used this material to claim, &quot;Jesus and his followers were Asiatic.&quot; (&quot;Asiatic&quot; was the term Drew Ali used for all darkly- or olive-colored people; he labeled all Whites as European. He suggested that all Asiatics should be allied.)

Ali crafted Moorish Science from a variety of sources, a &quot;network of alternative spiritualities that focused on the power of the individual to bring about personal transformation through mystical knowledge of the divine within&quot;. In the inter-war years in Chicago and other major cities, he used these concepts to preach racial pride and uplift. His approach appealed to thousands of African Americans who had left severely oppressive conditions in the South through the Great Migration and faced struggles in new urban environments.

==Practices and beliefs==
Ali believed that all African Americans are Moors, descended from the ancient Moabites, and taught that the kingdom of Moab evolved into modern Morocco. His claim does not align with peer-reviewed studies of human history, such as the genetics of African Americans and genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa. He claimed that Islam and its teachings are more beneficial to African Americans&#x27; salvation and that their &quot;true nature&quot; had been &quot;withheld&quot; from them. In the traditions Ali founded, male members of the Temple wear a fez or turban as head-covering; women wear a turban.

Ali&#x27;s followers added the suffixes Bey or El to their surnames to signify a connection to &quot;Moorish heritage&quot; and assert a new identity as &quot;Moorish&quot; Americans. This practice helped establish a distinct identity, acknowledging the loss of ancestral African tribal names while communicating their new identity.

As Ali taught his followers to be better citizens, he delivered speeches like &quot;A Divine Warning By the Prophet for the Nations,&quot; urging them to reject labels such as &quot;Black,&quot; &quot;colored,&quot; and &quot;Negro.&quot; He encouraged all Americans to embrace love over hate, believing Chicago could become a second Mecca.

The ushers of the Temple wore black fezzes. The leader of a given temple was known as a Grand Sheikh or Governor. Ali had several wives. According to &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, he claimed the power to marry and divorce at will.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1913, Drew Ali formed the Canaanite Temple in Newark, New Jersey. He left the city after agitating people with his views on race. Drew Ali and his followers migrated while planting congregations in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Detroit. Finally, Drew Ali settled in Chicago in 1925, saying the Midwest was &quot;closer to Islam&quot;. The following year, he officially registered Temple No. 9.

Ali advised his followers to avoid confrontation and instead focus on uplifting their community to earn respect. By doing so, they could establish their position in the United States by cultivating a cultural identity aligned with his beliefs regarding Black personhood. In the late 1920s, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; journalists estimated the Moorish Science Temple had 35,000 members in 17 temples in cities across the Midwest and upper South. It was reportedly studied and watched by the Chicago police.

Building Moorish Science-affiliated businesses was part of the group’s program, which was similar to Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League and the later Nation of Islam. By 1928, members of the Moorish Science Temple of America had obtained some respectability within Chicago and Illinois, being featured prominently and favorably in &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, an African-American newspaper, and conspicuously collaborated with African American politician and businessman Daniel Jackson.

Ali attended the January 1929 inauguration of Louis L. Emmerson as 27th Governor of Illinois in Springfield, Illinois. &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; stated that his trip included &quot;interviews with many distinguished citizens from Chicago, who greeted him on every hand.&quot; With the growth in its population and membership, Chicago was established as the center of the movement.

=== Internal split and murder ===
In early 1929, following a conflict over funds, Claude Green-Bey, the business manager of Chicago Temple No. 1, split from the Moorish Science Temple of America. He declared himself Grand Sheik and took a number of members with him. On March 15, Green-Bey was stabbed to death at the Unity Hall of the Moorish Science Temple on Indiana Avenue in Chicago.

At the time, Drew Ali was out of town, dealing with former Supreme Grand Governor Lomax Bey (ie, Ezaldine Muhammad, a professor), who had supported Green-Bey&#x27;s attempted coup. When Drew Ali returned to Chicago, the police arrested him and other members of the community on suspicion of having instigated the killing. No indictment was sworn for Drew Ali at that time.

===The death of Drew Ali===
Shortly after his release by the police, Drew Ali died at age 43 at his home in Chicago on July 20, 1929. Although the exact circumstances of his death remain unknown, his death certificate stated that he died from &quot;tuberculosis broncho-pneumonia&quot;. Despite the official report, many of his followers speculated that his death was caused by injuries from the police or from other members of the faith. Others thought it was indeed due to pneumonia. One follower told the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;: &quot;The Prophet was not ill; his work was done and he laid his head upon the lap of one of his followers and passed out.&quot;

===Succession and schism===
The death of Ali brought out a number of candidates to succeed him. Edward Mealy El stated that Drew Ali had personally declared him to be his successor. In August, within a month of Drew Ali&#x27;s death, John Givens El, Ali&#x27;s chauffeur, declared that he was Drew Ali reincarnated. He was said to have fainted while working on Drew Ali&#x27;s automobile, and &quot;the sign of the star and crescent [appeared] in his eyes.&quot;

At the September Unity Conference, Givens again made his claim of reincarnation. However, the governors of the Moorish Science Temple of America declared Charles Kirkman Bey to be Drew Ali&#x27;s successor and named him Grand Advisor.

With the support of several temples each, both Mealy El and Givens El went on to lead independent factions of the Moorish Science Temple. All three factions—formed and led by Kirkman Bey, Mealy El, and Givens El—are active today.

On September 25, 1929, Kirkman Bey&#x27;s wife reported to the Chicago police his apparent kidnapping by Ira Johnson. Accompanied by two Moorish Science members, the police visited the home of Johnson when they were met by gunfire. The attack escalated into a shoot-out that spilled into the surrounding neighborhood. In the end, a policeman as well as a member were killed in the gun battle, and a second policeman later died of his wounds. The police took 60 people into police custody, and a reported 1000 police officers patrolled Chicago&#x27;s South Side that evening. Johnson and two others were later convicted of murder.

Kirkman Bey went on to serve as Grand Advisor of one of the most important factions until 1959, when the reins were given to F. Nelson-Bey.

===Nation of Islam===
The community was further split when Wallace Fard Muhammad, known within the temple as David Ford-el, also claimed (or was taken by some) to be the reincarnation of Drew Ali. When his leadership was rejected, Ford El broke away from the Moorish Science Temple. He moved to Detroit, where he formed his own group, an organization that would become the Nation of Islam. The Nation of Islam denied any historical connection with the Moorish Science Temple until February 26, 2014, when Louis Farrakhan acknowledged the contribution(s) of Noble Drew Ali to the Nation of Islam and its founding principles.

===The 1930s===
Despite the turmoil and defections, the movement continued to grow in the 1930s. It is estimated that membership in the 1930s reached 30,000. There were major congregations in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Chicago.

One-third of the members, or 10,000, lived in Chicago, the center of the movement. There were congregations in numerous other cities where African Americans had migrated in the early 20th century. The group published several magazines: one was the &quot;Moorish Guide National&quot;. During the 1930s and 1940s, continued surveillance by police (and later the FBI) caused the Moors to become more withdrawn and critical of the government.

===FBI surveillance===
During the 1940s, the Moorish Science Temple (specifically the Kirkman Bey faction) came to the attention of the FBI, who investigated claims of members committing subversive activities by adhering to and spreading Japanese propaganda. The investigation failed to find any substantial evidence, and the investigations were dropped. The federal agency later investigated the organization in 1953 for violation of the Selective Service Act of 1948 and sedition. In September 1953, the Department of Justice determined that prosecution was not warranted for the alleged violations. The file that the FBI created on the temple grew to 3,117 pages during its lifetime. They never found any evidence of any connection or much sympathy of the temple&#x27;s members for Japan.

===El Rukn connection===
In 1976, Jeff Fort, leader of Chicago&#x27;s Black P Stone Nation, announced at his parole from prison in 1976 that he had converted to Islam. Moving to Milwaukee, Fort associated himself with the Moorish Science Temple of America. It is unclear whether he officially joined or was rejected by its members.

In 1978, Fort returned to Chicago and changed the name of his gang to &quot;El Rukn&quot; (&quot;the foundation&quot; in Arabic), also known as &quot;Circle Seven El Rukn Moorish Science Temple of America&quot; and the &quot;Moorish Science Temple, El Rukn tribe&quot;. Scholars are divided over the nature of the relationship, if any, between &quot;El Rukn&quot; and the Moorish Science Temple of America. Fort reportedly hoped that an apparent affiliation with a religious organization would discourage law enforcement.

=== 1980–2000s ===
In 1984, the Chicago congregation bought a building from Buddhist monks in Ukrainian Village, which continues to be used for Temple No. 9. Demographic and cultural changes have decreased the attraction of young people to the Moorish Science Temple. Only about 200 members attended a convention in 2007, rather than the thousands in the past. In the early 2000s, the temples in Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., had about 200 members each, and many were older.

On July 15, 2019, Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney, as part of a diversity program, proclaimed July 15 to be &quot;Morocco Day&quot;. The city mistakenly invited members of the local Moorish Science temple to the ceremony, believing them to be of actual Moroccan descent.

An organization with headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, claiming to be &quot;the Moorish Science Temple teaching the full National side of the Moorish Movement&quot;, is the Moorish Science Temple, with registered business names of the Divine and National Movement of North America, Inc., and Moorish American National Republic.

==Moorish sovereign citizens==

During the 1990s, some former followers of the Moorish Science Temple of America and the Washitaw Nation formed an offshoot of the sovereign citizen movement which came to be known as Moorish sovereign citizens. Members believe the United States federal government to be illegitimate, which they attribute to a variety of factors including Reconstruction following the U.S. Civil War and the abandonment of the gold standard in the 1930s. The number of Moorish sovereign citizens is uncertain but estimated to range between 3,000 and 6,000, organized mostly in small groups of several dozen. Moorish sovereign citizens believe black people constitute an elite class within American society, despite the fact that much of their underlying ideology originated among white supremacist groups.

The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies Moorish sovereign citizens as an extremist anti-government group. The group&#x27;s tactics include filing false deeds and property claims, false liens against government officials, frivolous legal motions to overwhelm courts, and invented legalese used in court appearances and filings. Various groups and individuals identifying as Moorish sovereign citizens have used the unorthodox &quot;quantum grammar&quot; created by David Wynn Miller. An article syndicated by the Associated Press states that the Temple has disavowed any affiliation with Moorish sovereign citizens, calling them &quot;radical and subversive fringe groups&quot; and also states that &quot;Moorish leaders are looking into legal remedies.&quot; The article also quotes an academic who has been advising authorities on how to distinguish registered Temple members from impostors in the sovereign citizen movement.

<doc id="1072857" wikidata="Q2912794" url="?curid=1072857" title="Biosignature">
<text>A biosignature (sometimes called chemical fossil or molecular fossil) is any substance – such as an element, isotope, molecule, or phenomenon – that provides scientific evidence of past or present life on a planet. Measurable attributes of life include its physical or chemical structures, its use of free energy, and the production of biomass and wastes.

The field of astrobiology uses biosignatures as evidence for the search for past or present extraterrestrial life.

== Types ==
Biosignatures can be grouped into ten broad categories:

#Isotope patterns: Isotopic evidence or patterns that require biological processes.
#Chemistry: Chemical features that require biological activity.
#Organic matter: Organics formed by biological processes.
#Minerals: Minerals or biomineral-phases whose composition and/or morphology indicate biological activity (e.g., biomagnetite).
#Microscopic structures and textures: Biologically-formed cements, microtextures, microfossils, and films.
#Macroscopic physical structures and textures: Structures that indicate microbial ecosystems, biofilms (e.g., stromatolites), or fossils of larger organisms.
#Temporal variability: Variations in time of atmospheric gases, reflectivity, or macroscopic appearance that indicates life&#x27;s presence.
#Surface reflectance features: Large-scale reflectance features due to biological pigments.
#Atmospheric gases: Gases formed by metabolic processes, which may be present on a planet-wide scale.
#Technosignatures: Signatures that indicate a technologically advanced civilization.

== Viability ==
Determining whether an observed feature is a true biosignature is complex. There are three criteria that a potential biosignature must meet to be considered viable for further research: Reliability, survivability, and detectability.

=== Reliability ===
A biosignature must be able to dominate over all other processes that may produce similar physical, spectral, and chemical features. When investigating a potential biosignature, scientists must carefully consider all other possible origins of the biosignature in question. Many forms of life are known to mimic geochemical reactions. One of the theories on the origin of life involves molecules developing the ability to catalyse geochemical reactions to exploit the energy being released by them. These are some of the earliest known metabolisms (see methanogenesis). In such case, scientists might search for a disequilibrium in the geochemical cycle, which would point to a reaction happening more or less often than it should. A disequilibrium such as this could be interpreted as an indication of life.

=== Survivability ===
A biosignature must be able to last for long enough so that a probe, telescope, or human can be able to detect it. A consequence of a biological organism&#x27;s use of metabolic reactions for energy is the production of metabolic waste. In addition, the structure of an organism can be preserved as a fossil and we know that some fossils on Earth are as old as 3.5 billion years. These byproducts can make excellent biosignatures since they provide direct evidence for life. However, in order to be a viable biosignature, a byproduct must subsequently remain intact so that scientists may discover it.

=== Detectability ===
A biosignature must be detectable with the most latest technology to be relevant in scientific investigation. This seems to be an obvious statement, however, there are many scenarios in which life may be present on a planet yet remain undetectable because of human-caused limitations.

==== False positives ====
Every possible biosignature is associated with its own set of unique false positive mechanisms or non-biological processes that can mimic the detectable feature of a biosignature. An important example is using oxygen as a biosignature. On Earth, the majority of life is centred around oxygen. It is a byproduct of photosynthesis and is subsequently used by other life forms to breathe. Oxygen is also readily detectable in spectra, with multiple bands across a relatively wide wavelength range, therefore, it makes a very good biosignature. However, finding oxygen alone in a planet&#x27;s atmosphere is not enough to confirm a biosignature because of the false-positive mechanisms associated with it. One possibility is that oxygen can build up abiotically via photolysis if there is a low inventory of non-condensable gasses or if the planet loses a lot of water. Finding and distinguishing a biosignature from its potential false-positive mechanisms is one of the most complicated parts of testing for viability because it relies on human ingenuity to break an abiotic-biological degeneracy, if nature allows.

==== False negatives ====
Opposite to false positives, false negative biosignatures arise in a scenario where life may be present on another planet, but some processes on that planet make potential biosignatures undetectable. This is an ongoing problem and area of research in preparation for future telescopes that will be capable of observing exoplanetary atmospheres.

==== Human limitations ====
There are many ways in which humans may limit the viability of a potential biosignature. The resolution of a telescope becomes important when vetting certain false-positive mechanisms, and many current telescopes do not have the capabilities to observe at the resolution needed to investigate some of these. In addition, probes and telescopes are worked on by huge collaborations of scientists with varying interests. As a result, new probes and telescopes carry a variety of instruments that are a compromise to everyone&#x27;s unique inputs. For a different type of scientist to detect something unrelated to biosignatures, a sacrifice may have to be made in the capability of an instrument to search for biosignatures.

== General examples ==

=== Geomicrobiology ===

The ancient record on Earth provides an opportunity to see what geochemical signatures are produced by microbial life and how these signatures are preserved over geologic time. Some related disciplines such as geochemistry, geobiology, and geomicrobiology often use biosignatures to determine if living organisms are or were present in a sample. These possible biosignatures include: (a) microfossils and stromatolites; (b) molecular structures (biomarkers) and isotopic compositions of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen in organic matter; (c) multiple sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of minerals; and (d) abundance relationships and isotopic compositions of redox-sensitive metals (e.g., Fe, Mo, Cr, and rare earth elements).

For example, the particular fatty acids measured in a sample can indicate which types of bacteria and archaea live in that environment. Another example is the long-chain fatty alcohols with more than 23 atoms that are produced by planktonic bacteria. When used in this sense, geochemists often prefer the term biomarker. Another example is the presence of straight-chain lipids in the form of alkanes, alcohols, and fatty acids with 20–36 carbon atoms in soils or sediments. Peat deposits are an indication of originating from the epicuticular wax of higher plants.

Life processes may produce a range of biosignatures such as nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, amino acids, kerogen-like material and various morphological features that are detectable in rocks and sediments. Microbes often interact with geochemical processes, leaving features in the rock record indicative of biosignatures. For example, bacterial micrometer-sized pores in carbonate rocks resemble inclusions under transmitted light, but have distinct sizes, shapes, and patterns (swirling or dendritic) and are distributed differently from common fluid inclusions. A potential biosignature is a phenomenon that &quot;may&quot; have been produced by life, but for which alternate abiotic origins may also be possible.

===Morphology===

Another possible biosignature might be morphology since the shape and size of certain objects may potentially indicate the presence of past or present life. For example, microscopic magnetite crystals in the Martian meteorite ALH84001 are one of the longest-debated of several potential biosignatures in that specimen. The possible biomineral studied in the Martian ALH84001 meteorite includes putative microbial fossils, tiny rock-like structures whose shape was a potential biosignature because it resembled known bacteria. Most scientists ultimately concluded that these were far too small to be fossilized cells. A consensus that has emerged from these discussions, and is now seen as a critical requirement, is the demand for further lines of evidence in addition to any morphological data that supports such extraordinary claims. Currently, the scientific consensus is that &quot;morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection&quot;. Interpretation of morphology is notoriously subjective, and its use alone has led to numerous errors of interpretation.

===Chemistry===

No single compound will prove life once existed. Rather, it will be distinctive patterns present in any organic compounds showing a process of selection. For example, membrane lipids left behind by degraded cells will be concentrated, have a limited size range, and comprise an even number of carbons. Similarly, life only uses left-handed amino acids. Biosignatures need not be chemical, however, and can also be suggested by a distinctive magnetic biosignature.

Chemical biosignatures include any suite of complex organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and other elements or heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, which are found in crude oils, bitumen, petroleum source rock and eventually show simplification in molecular structure from the parent organic molecules found in all living organisms. They are complex carbon-based molecules derived from formerly living organisms. Each biomarker is quite distinctive when compared to its counterparts, as the time required for organic matter to convert to crude oil is characteristic. Most biomarkers also usually have high molecular mass.

Some examples of biomarkers found in petroleum are pristane, triterpanes, steranes, phytane and porphyrin. Such petroleum biomarkers are produced via chemical synthesis using biochemical compounds as their main constituents. For instance, triterpenes are derived from biochemical compounds found on land angiosperm plants. The abundance of petroleum biomarkers in small amounts in its reservoir or source rock make it necessary to use sensitive and differential approaches to analyze the presence of those compounds. The techniques typically used include gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.

Petroleum biomarkers are highly important in petroleum inspection as they help indicate the depositional territories and determine the geological properties of oils. For instance, they provide more details concerning their maturity and the source material. In addition to that they can also be good parameters of age, hence they are technically referred to as &quot;chemical fossils&quot;. The ratio of pristane to phytane (pr:ph) is the geochemical factor that allows petroleum biomarkers to be successful indicators of their depositional environments.

Geologists and geochemists use biomarker traces found in crude oils and their related source rock to unravel the stratigraphic origin and migration patterns of presently existing petroleum deposits. The dispersion of biomarker molecules is also quite distinctive for each type of oil and its source; hence, they display unique fingerprints. Another factor that makes petroleum biomarkers more preferable than their counterparts is that they have a high tolerance to environmental weathering and corrosion. Such biomarkers are very advantageous and often used in the detection of oil spillage in the major waterways. The same biomarkers can also be used to identify contamination in lubricant oils. However, biomarker analysis of untreated rock cuttings can be expected to produce misleading results. This is due to potential hydrocarbon contamination and biodegradation in the rock samples.

=== Atmospheric ===

The atmospheric properties of exoplanets are of particular importance, as atmospheres provide the most likely observables for the near future, including habitability indicators and biosignatures. Over billions of years, the processes of life on a planet would result in a mixture of chemicals unlike anything that could form in an ordinary chemical equilibrium. For example, large amounts of oxygen and small amounts of methane are generated by life on Earth.

An exoplanet&#x27;s color—or reflectance spectrum—can also be used as a biosignature due to the effect of pigments that are uniquely biologic in origin such as the pigments of phototrophic and photosynthetic life forms. Scientists use the Earth as an example of this when looked at from far away (see Pale Blue Dot) as a comparison to worlds observed outside of our solar system. Ultraviolet radiation on life forms could also induce biofluorescence in visible wavelengths that may be detected by the new generation of space observatories under development.

Some scientists have reported methods of detecting hydrogen and methane in extraterrestrial atmospheres. Habitability indicators and biosignatures must be interpreted within a planetary and environmental context. For example, the presence of oxygen and methane together could indicate the kind of extreme thermochemical disequilibrium generated by life. Two of the top 14,000 proposed atmospheric biosignatures are dimethyl sulfide and chloromethane (). An alternative biosignature is the combination of methane and carbon dioxide.

The detection of phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus is being investigated as a possible biosignature.

=== Atmospheric disequilibrium ===

A disequilibrium in the abundance of gas species in an atmosphere can be interpreted as a biosignature. Life has greatly altered the atmosphere on Earth in a way that would be unlikely for any other processes to replicate. Therefore, a departure from equilibrium is evidence for a biosignature. For example, the abundance of methane in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is orders of magnitude above the equilibrium value due to the constant methane flux that life on the surface emits. Depending on the host star, a disequilibrium in the methane abundance on another planet may indicate a biosignature.

=== Agnostic biosignatures ===
Because the only form of known life is that on Earth, the search for biosignatures is heavily influenced by the products that life produces on Earth. However, life that is different from life on Earth may still produce biosignatures that are detectable by humans, even though nothing is known about their specific biology. This form of biosignature is called an &quot;agnostic biosignature&quot; because it is independent of the form of life that produces it. It is widely agreed that all life–no matter how different it is from life on Earth–needs a source of energy to thrive. This must involve some sort of chemical disequilibrium, which can be exploited for metabolism. Geological processes are independent of life, and if scientists can constrain the geology well enough on another planet, then they know what the particular geologic equilibrium for that planet should be. A deviation from geological equilibrium can be interpreted as an atmospheric disequilibrium and agnostic biosignature.

=== Antibiosignatures ===
In the same way that detecting a biosignature would be a significant discovery about a planet, finding evidence that life is &quot;not&quot; present can also be an important discovery about a planet. Life relies on redox imbalances to metabolize the resources available into energy. The evidence that nothing on an earth is taking advantage of the &quot;free lunch&quot; available due to an observed redox imbalance is called antibiosignatures.

=== Polyelectrolytes ===
The Polyelectrolyte theory of the gene is a proposed generic biosignature. In 2002, Steven A. Benner and Daniel Hutter proposed that for a linear genetic biopolymer dissolved in water, such as DNA, to undergo Darwinian evolution anywhere in the universe, it must be a polyelectrolyte, a polymer containing repeating ionic charges. Benner and others proposed methods for concentrating and analyzing these polyelectrolyte genetic biopolymers on Mars, Enceladus, and Europa.

== Specific examples ==
=== Methane on Mars ===

The presence of methane in the atmosphere of Mars is an area of ongoing research and a highly contentious subject. Because of its tendency to be destroyed in the atmosphere by photochemistry, the presence of excess methane on a planet can indicate that there must be an active source. With life being the strongest source of methane on Earth, observing a disequilibrium in the methane abundance on another planet could be a viable biosignature.

Since 2004, there have been several detections of methane in the Mars atmosphere by a variety of instruments onboard orbiters and ground-based landers on the Martian surface as well as Earth-based telescopes. These missions reported values anywhere between a &#x27;background level&#x27; ranging between 0.24 and 0.65 parts per billion by volume (p.p.b.v.) to as much as 45 ± 10 p.p.b.v.

However, recent measurements using the ACS and NOMAD instruments on board the ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter have failed to detect any methane over a range of latitudes and longitudes on both Martian hemispheres. These highly sensitive instruments were able to put an upper bound on the overall methane abundance at 0.05 p.p.b.v. This nondetection is a major contradiction to what was previously observed with less sensitive instruments and will remain a strong argument in the ongoing debate over the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere.

Furthermore, current photochemical models cannot explain the presence of methane in the atmosphere of Mars and its reported rapid variations in space and time. Neither its fast appearance nor disappearance can be explained yet. To rule out a biogenic origin for the methane, a future probe or lander hosting a mass spectrometer will be needed, as the isotopic proportions of carbon-12 to carbon-14 in methane could distinguish between a biogenic and non-biogenic origin, similarly to the use of the δ13C standard for recognizing biogenic methane on Earth.

=== Martian atmosphere ===

The Martian atmosphere contains high abundances of photochemically produced CO and H2, which are reducing molecules. Mars&#x27; atmosphere is otherwise mostly oxidizing, leading to a source of untapped energy that life could exploit if it used by a metabolism compatible with one or both of these reducing molecules. Because these molecules can be observed, scientists use this as evidence for an antibiosignature. Scientists have used this concept as an argument against life on Mars.

== Missions inside the Solar System ==

Astrobiological exploration is founded upon the premise that biosignatures encountered in space will be recognizable as extraterrestrial life. The usefulness of a biosignature is determined not only by the probability of life creating it but also by the improbability of non-biological (abiotic) processes producing it. Concluding that evidence of an extraterrestrial life form (past or present) has been discovered requires proving that a possible biosignature was produced by the activities or remains of life. As with most scientific discoveries, discovery of a biosignature will require evidence building up until no other explanation exists.

Possible examples of a biosignature include complex organic molecules or structures whose formation is virtually unachievable in the absence of life:

# Cellular and extracellular morphologies
# Biomolecules in rocks
# Bio-organic molecular structures
# Chirality
# Biogenic minerals
# Biogenic isotope patterns in minerals and organic compounds
# Atmospheric gases
# Photosynthetic pigments

=== The &quot;Viking&quot; missions to Mars ===

The &quot;Viking&quot; missions to Mars in the 1970s conducted the first experiments which were explicitly designed to look for biosignatures on another planet. Each of the two &quot;Viking&quot; landers carried three life-detection experiments which looked for signs of metabolism; however, the results were declared inconclusive.

=== Mars Science Laboratory ===

The &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover from the Mars Science Laboratory mission, with its &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover is currently assessing the potential past and present habitability of the Martian environment and is attempting to detect biosignatures on the surface of Mars. Considering the MSL instrument payload package, the following classes of biosignatures are within the MSL detection window: organism morphologies (cells, body fossils, casts), biofabrics (including microbial mats), diagnostic organic molecules, isotopic signatures, evidence of biomineralization and bioalteration, spatial patterns in chemistry, and biogenic gases. The &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover targets outcrops to maximize the probability of detecting &#x27;fossilized&#x27; organic matter preserved in sedimentary deposits.

=== ExoMars Orbiter ===
The 2016 ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is a Mars telecommunications orbiter and atmospheric gas analyzer mission. It delivered the &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; EDM lander and then began to settle into its science orbit to map the sources of methane on Mars and other gases, and in doing so, will help select the landing site for the &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover to be launched in 2022. The primary objective of the &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover mission is the search for biosignatures on the surface and subsurface by using a drill able to collect samples down to a depth of , away from the destructive radiation that bathes the surface.

=== Mars 2020 Rover ===
The Mars 2020 rover, which launched in 2020, is intended to investigate an astrobiologically relevant ancient environment on Mars, investigate its surface geological processes and history, including the assessment of its past habitability, the possibility of past life on Mars, and potential for preservation of biosignatures within accessible geological materials. In addition, it will cache the most interesting samples for possible future transport to Earth.

=== Titan &quot;Dragonfly&quot; ===
NASA&#x27;s &quot;Dragonfly&quot; lander/aircraft concept is proposed to launch in 2025 and would seek evidence of biosignatures on the organic-rich surface and atmosphere of Titan, as well as study its possible prebiotic primordial soup. Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and is widely believed to have a large subsurface ocean consisting of a salty brine. In addition, scientists believe that Titan may have the conditions necessary to promote prebiotic chemistry, making it a prime candidate for biosignature discovery.

=== &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; ===
NASA&#x27;s &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; probe is designed as a flyby mission to Jupiter&#x27;s smallest Galilean moon, Europa. The mission launched in October 2024 and is set to reach Europa in April 2030, where it will investigate the potential for habitability on Europa. Europa is one of the best candidates for biosignature discovery in the Solar System because of the scientific consensus that it retains a subsurface ocean, with two to three times the volume of water on Earth. Evidence for this subsurface ocean includes:

*&quot;Voyager 1&quot; (1979): The first close-up photos of Europa are taken. Scientists propose that a subsurface ocean could cause the tectonic-like marks on the surface.
*&quot;Galileo&quot; (1997): The magnetometer aboard this probe detected a subtle change in the magnetic field near Europa. This was later interpreted as a disruption in the expected magnetic field due to the current induction in a conducting layer on Europa. The composition of this conducting layer is consistent with a salty subsurface ocean.
*Hubble Space Telescope (2012): An image was taken of Europa which showed evidence for a plume of water vapor coming off the surface.

The &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; probe includes instruments to help confirm the existence and composition of a subsurface ocean and thick icy layer. In addition, the instruments will be used to map and study surface features that may indicate tectonic activity due to a subsurface ocean.

=== Enceladus ===

Although there are no set plans to search for biosignatures on Saturn&#x27;s sixth-largest moon, Enceladus, the prospects of biosignature discovery there are exciting enough to warrant several mission concepts that may be funded in the future. Similar to Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa, there is much evidence for a subsurface ocean to also exist on Enceladus. Plumes of water vapor were first observed in 2005 by the Cassini mission and were later determined to contain salt as well as organic compounds. In 2014, more evidence was presented using gravimetric measurements on Enceladus to conclude that there is in fact a large reservoir of water underneath an icy surface. Mission design concepts include:

*Enceladus Life Finder (ELF)
*Enceladus Life Signatures and Habitability
* Enceladus Organic Analyzer
* Enceladus Explorer (En-Ex)
* Explorer of Enceladus and Titan (E2T)
* Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET)
* Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE)
* Testing the Habitability of Enceladus&#x27;s Ocean (THEO)

All of these concept missions have similar science goals: To assess the habitability of Enceladus and search for biosignatures, in line with the strategic map for exploring the ocean-world Enceladus.

== Searching outside of the Solar System ==

At 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs, 40 trillion km, or 25 trillion miles) away from Earth, the closest potentially habitable exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b, which was discovered in 2016. This means it would take more than 18,100 years to get there if a vessel could consistently travel as fast as the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft (250,000 kilometers per hour or 150,000 miles per hour). It is currently not feasible to send humans or even probes to search for biosignatures outside of the Solar System. The only way to search for biosignatures outside of the Solar System is by observing exoplanets with telescopes.

There have been no plausible or confirmed biosignature detections outside of the Solar System. Despite this, it is a rapidly growing field of research due to the prospects of the next generation of telescopes. The James Webb Space Telescope, which launched in December 2021, will be a promising next step in the search for biosignatures. Although its wavelength range and resolution will not be compatible with some of the more important atmospheric biosignature gas bands like oxygen, it will still be able to detect some evidence for oxygen false positive mechanisms.

The new generation of ground-based 30-meter class telescopes (Thirty Meter Telescope and Extremely Large Telescope) will have the ability to take high-resolution spectra of exoplanet atmospheres at a variety of wavelengths. These telescopes will be capable of distinguishing some of the more difficult false positive mechanisms such as the abiotic buildup of oxygen via photolysis. In addition, their large collecting area will enable high angular resolution, making direct imaging studies more feasible.

<text>Zona Gale (August 26, 1874 – December 27, 1938), also known by her married name, Zona Gale Breese, was an American novelist, short story writer, and playwright. She became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1921. The close relationship she had with her parents influenced both her writing and personal life. Her books, based on her hometown, were noted for their charm and intimate realism, capturing the underlying emotions and motivations of her characters. All of her works were published under her maiden name, Zona Gale.

She became a single parent after adopting a girl. Her parents died in 1923 and 1929, after which she became interested in mysticism, leading to a shift in her writing style, much to the dismay of critics who had enjoyed her earlier work. She remained unmarried until her fifties, when she married a childhood friend who was a widower. She supported various political and social causes, including women&#x27;s rights, pacifism, and education.

==Early life and education==
Gale was born on August 26, 1874, in Portage, Wisconsin to Charles Franklin and Eliza Beers Gale. She was very close to her parents, who were the inspiration for the &quot;charming elderly couple&quot; in her book &quot;The Loves of Pelleas and Etare&quot;. She began writing and illustrating stories at the age of 7. Her first story was printed in pencil, because she did not know how to write yet, and the manila pages were bound into a book that was held together by a ribbon.

Gale submitted a short story, &quot;Both&quot;, to the &quot;Milwaukee Evening Wisconsin&quot; when she was sixteen, and was paid $3 for the story. She attended Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin before she entered the University of Wisconsin, where she received a Bachelor of Literature or Library Science degree in 1895. She received a master&#x27;s degree in Library Science in 1899 and another master&#x27;s degree in 1901. While a student, her poems were published in university publications. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in 1929.

==Career==
After college, Gale wrote for &quot;Milwaukee Evening Wisconsin&quot;. She got the job by showing up at the city editor&#x27;s desk each day. After two weeks, the city editor asked her to write a story about a flower show. After a total of six weeks, she was given a job on the paper. In 1896, she worked for the &quot;Milwaukee Journal.&quot; She went to New York City in 1901 and applied to get on every paper in the city. To get a job, she prepared a list of story ideas relevant for that day for the &quot;New York World&quot; and persisted until she got two assignments, and then a job.

Hired as a secretary to Edmund Clarence Stedman, she met people from his literary circle, including Ridgely Torrence, with whom she would have a relationship, and Richard Le Gallienne. She returned to her hometown in 1903 and saw it in a new light that changed her direction as a writer. She found that her &quot;old world was full of new possibilities.&quot; She returned to Portage permanently in 1904, where she wrote her stories full-time.

She published &quot;Romance Island&quot;, her first novel, in 1906, and began the popular &quot;Friendship Village&quot; series of stories which were thought to be based upon Portage, although Gale stated that Friendship Village was not based upon any one town, but typical of a small town. She won first prize, worth $2,000, in 1910 for &quot;The Ancient Dawn&quot; in the short fiction contest by the &quot;Delineator&quot;. In 1920, she published the novel &quot;Miss Lulu Bett&quot;, which depicts life in the Midwestern United States, after spending time at Bonnie Oaks. Her novel, appreciated for its realism, was compared to the works of Sinclair Lewis and Theodore Dreiser. She adapted it as a play, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1921. For the time, she had a rare skill in the way she wrote about common daily experiences of ordinary people in a small town. Her early works were considered sentimental, but also, like Jane Austen&#x27;s work, in touch with the deeper meanings of her character&#x27;s expressions during tea-table banter. Frederick Tabor Cooper said, &quot;We bask for a few hours in that human exhilarating sunshine that radiates straight from the heart of people who are real and true and big of soul.&quot; Over time, Gale&#x27;s work evolved from saccharine stories of village life to tales of small-town monotony and routine.

&quot;Preface to a Life&quot;, published in 1926 was based on a new-found mysticism that grew after the death of her mother in 1923 and her father in 1929. The main character mistakes his inner wisdom and mysticism for madness. She published essays based upon mysticism. In these works, people&#x27;s problems could be solved through a kind of transcendentalist enlightenment. Critics, who did not enjoy her book and essays, viewed her work unfavorably from that point forward, even when she tried to return to realism.

She wrote a book about a friend, Frank Augustus Miller, the founder of the Mission Inn Hotel, after his death in 1935. The biography, titled &quot;Frank Miller of Mission Inn&quot;, was published in 1938. Throughout her career, she wrote under her maiden name, Zona Gale.

==Political and suffrage efforts==

She was a suffragist, an activist, and a liberal Democrat, who supported the La Follettes, including Robert Sr. and his two sons Robert Jr. and Philip. She spoke for them at events and on the radio when they were campaigning for office.

She was an active member of the National Woman&#x27;s Party, and she lobbied extensively for the 1921 Wisconsin Equal Rights Law. In the same year, she attended the founding meeting (in New York) of the Lucy Stone League and became a member of its executive committee. Her activism on behalf of women was her way to help solve &quot;a problem she returned to repeatedly in her novels: women&#x27;s frustration at their lack of opportunities.&quot;

She became a pacifist during World War I. She was a director of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. She also criticized the inclusion of military training in college curriculums. She was on the executive committee of the American Union Against Militarism and a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the Women&#x27;s Peace Society.

She was against racial prejudice and promoted improved means of communication among races. She served on the Wisconsin Free Library Commission. In 1922, she established Zona Gale scholarships to pay towards talented young adult&#x27;s education.

==University of Wisconsin==

She later became a regent of the university and became embroiled in the ouster of the president, Dr. Glenn Frank. Governor Philip La Follette convinced other regents, some of whom he had appointed, to call for the removal of Frank. Gale stood by Frank and criticized the governor.

==Personal life==

In 1902, she met Ridgely Torrence in New York, with whom she developed a &quot;deeply felt spiritual love&quot;, but when considering whether to stay in New York or return to Portage, she returned to her family. Construction began on a house for her and her parents in 1906. Located along the shore of the Wisconsin River in Portage, she lived in the house most of her adult life.
Her mother died in 1923. In 1926, she began caring for a girl, Leslyn, who was a relative. She formally adopted her in 1931. On June 12, 1928, at the age of 54, she married William L. Breese, who was a platonic friend from her childhood and a widower. He was a wealthy banker and hosiery manufacturer. They lived in a house on MacFarlane Road in Portage after their marriage. She became a step mother to William&#x27;s daughter, Juliette Blackman Breese, who married Cecil Bennett in 1930. Her father died in 1929. She became interested in philosophy after the death of her parents.

She enjoyed travel to California, New York, Japan and other places. Gale, a frequent visitor to the Mission Inn Hotel in Riverside, California, became a friend of Frank Augustus Miller, the founder of the hotel.

==Death and legacy==
Gale came to Chicago in mid-December 1938 for treatment of an ailment and contracted pneumonia about December 20. She died of pneumonia in Passavant Hospital in Chicago on December 27. Dr. Glenn Frank, former president of the University of Wisconsin, presided over her funeral. She was buried at Silver Lake Cemetery in Portage. Most of her estate of $60,000 () went to Leslyn, age 12, and Juliette. Leslyn was to receive Gale&#x27;s personal effects and the Zona Gale house upon her marriage. Juliette was bequeathed another house. Some money was set aside for the Zona Gale scholarships. William Breese died on October 1, 1954, at the age of 90. By the time of Breese&#x27;s death, Leslyn married Robert Keie of Saginaw, Michigan.

In her memory, William Breese established the Zona Gale Breese Library in Portage. He donated two houses, one of which was the Zona Gale house that went to the Women&#x27;s Civic League. The performing arts center in Portage was named after her. A historic marker at Commerce Plaza Park in Portage memorializes her life.

<doc id="1072861" wikidata="Q263791" url="?curid=1072861" title="Hafsa bint Umar">
<text>Hafsa bint Umar (; 605–665) was the fourth wife of Muhammad and a daughter of the second caliph Umar (). In Islamic writings, her name is thus often prefixed by the title &quot;Mother of the Believers&quot; (Arabic: أمّ المؤمنين, &quot;ʾumm al-muʾminīn&quot;).

== Early life ==
Hafsa was the daughter and eldest child of &#x27;Umar ibn al-Khattab and Zaynab bint Maz&#x27;un. She was born &quot;when Quraysh were building the House &quot;Kaʿbah&quot;, five years before the Prophet was sent,&quot; i.e., in 605.

== Marriage ==
She was married to Khunays ibn Hudhafa but became a widow in August 624.

As soon as Hafsa had completed her waiting period, her father Umar offered her hand to Uthman ibn &#x27;Affan, and thereafter to Abu Bakr; but they both refused her. Disappointed, Umar went to Muhammad to complain about this, and Muhammad replied, &quot;Hafsa will marry one better than Uthman and Uthman will marry one better than Hafsa.&quot;

Muhammad married Hafsa in Sha&#x27;ban AH 3 (late January or early February 625). This marriage &quot;gave the Prophet the chance of allying himself with this faithful follower&quot;, i.e., Umar, had become his father-in-law.

===Surat al-Tahrim===
There are two stories related to the revelation of the opening verses of Surat al-Tahrim. One is authentic according to Imams al-Bukhari and Muslim and found in Sahih Muslim 1474, narrated by the Prophet&#x27;s wife Aisha. In this first narration, the Prophet prevented himself from drinking honey to please his wives. 

The latter narration is &quot;mursal&quot; (meaning the chain of narration was interrupted) and &quot;ḍaʻīf&quot; &quot;(&quot;weak), narrated by Zaid ibn Aslam from the third generation who did not witness the event and found in Tafsir al-Tabari (who was known to record numerous kinds of narrations, both authentic and inauthentic, as a compendium for hadith scholars to peruse and criticize narrations). In this weak narration, the Prophet was intimate with Maria al-Qibtiyya while Hafsa was away visiting her father, then asked him &quot;In my home and on my bed?&quot; upon returning and discovering about their act. He then made Maria forbidden upon himself to please Hafsa. Al-Qurtubi states that the first one is authentic and the second is weak.

Ibn Al-Arabi wrote in &quot;Ahkam al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; that: &quot;Indeed, the only authentic narration is that it was about honey, that the Prophet drank it with Zainab, and Aisha and Hafsa pretended to be offended by it. There occurred what occurred and the Prophet made an oath never to drink it again. He confided that to his wife and the verse was revealed regarding all of them&quot;.

== Notable work ==
Uthman, when he became Caliph, used Hafsa&#x27;s copy when he standardized the text of
Qur&#x27;an. She is also said to have narrated sixty &quot;hadiths&quot; from Muhammad.

== Death ==
She died in Sha&#x27;ban AH 45, i.e., in October or November 665. She is buried in Al-Baqi Cemetery next to the other Mothers of the Faithful.

==Contrasting Views==
===Sunni View===
Hafsa is seen as scholarly and inquisitive by the Sunnis. She is also respected as a Mother of The Believers.

===Shi&#x27;a View===
Due to the honey incident with the prophet, Shi&#x27;as disapprove of Hafsa and Aisha in this particular incident and cite the beginning of Surat al-Tahrim and the accompanying hadith as evidence. But they do not curse them generally, which is extremism.

<text>Giovanni Maria Vitelleschi (1396 – 2 April 1440) was an Italian cardinal and condottiere.

== Biography ==
Vitelleschi was born in Corneto (modern Tarquinia, then part of the Papal States), some kilometres north of Rome, as a member of the Vitelleschi noble family. He received a military education, which he refined as apostolic protonotary under Pope Martin V. The fighting bishop of Recanati from 1431, and afterwards made a cardinal, he was commander of the papal armies of Pope Eugene IV when the Colonna faction at Rome, infuriated by the reversal of their fortunes when Eugene succeeded Martin V (a member of the Colonna), backed an insurrection that raised a temporary republic at Rome and forced Eugene into exile at Florence in May 1434. The city was restored to obedience by Giovanni Vitelleschi in the following October, in a display of ferocious cruelty. Vitelleschi abrogated all Roman rights and had the Roman Senate declare him &quot;tertius pater patriae post Romulum&quot; (&quot;the third Father of his Country since Romulus&quot;). He commanded the papal troops against René of Anjou, who claimed the throne of Naples. In 1439 he was sent by the Pope to expel the rebel Corrado IV Trinci from Foligno, which he besieged and captured. The nobleman was beheaded and the city restored to Papal authority.

Vitelleschi had received his military training as a youth in the &quot;banda&quot; of Tartaglia and refined his education under the tutelage of Pope Martin V, who made him apostolic pronotary. His success at putting down the republicans at Rome earned him the purely honorary title  Latin Patriarch of Alexandria and the more immediate one of archbishop of Florence. He was made a cardinal on 9 August 1437 and was called the &quot;Cardinal of Florence&quot; where, according to Machiavelli, he was regarded with deep distrust:
He was bold and cunning; and, having obtained great influence, was appointed to command all the forces of the church, and conduct all the enterprises of the pontiff, whether in Tuscany, Romagna, the kingdom of Naples, or in Rome. Hence he acquired so much power over the pontiff, and the papal troops, that the former was afraid of commanding him, and the latter obeyed no one else

Florence&#x27;s spies kept a close watch over the mail and soon intercepted letters from the Patriarch to Niccolò Piccinino, who was currently ravaging Tuscany with his warband. The correspondence was in cypher and full of circumlocutions but was interpreted as dangerous to the Pope himself. Eugene IV determined to incarcerate the Patriarch. The manner in which he was caught at Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo in Rome by its castellan, Antonio Rido of Padua, is recounted by Machiavelli
The patriarch, having determined to go into Tuscany, prepared to leave Rome on the following day, and ordered the castellan to be upon the drawbridge of the fortress in the morning, for he wished to speak with him as he passed. Antonio perceived this to be the favourable moment, informed his people what they were to do, and awaited the arrival of the patriarch upon the bridge, which adjoined the building, and might for the purpose of security be raised or lowered as occasion required. The appointed time found him punctual; and Antonio, having drawn him, as if for the convenience of conversation, on to the bridge, gave a signal to his men, who immediately raised it, and in a moment the cardinal, from being a commander of armies, found himself a prisoner of the castellan. The patriarch&#x27;s followers at first began to use threats, but being informed of the pope&#x27;s directions they were appeased. The castellan comforting him with kind words, he replied, that &quot;the great do not make each other prisoners to let them go again; and that those whom it is proper to take, it is not well to set free.&quot; He shortly afterwards died in prison.

Vitelleschi died in 1440 and was succeeded by Ludovico Trevisan. The Vitelleschi clan retained considerable weight in Central Italy. Vitelleschi&#x27;s nephew, (died 13 December 1463), bishop of Corneto and Montefiascone, was made a cardinal on 6 April 1444. Giovanni Vitelleschi commissioned Filippo Lippi to paint the famous &quot;Madonna and Child Enthroned&quot; (now in Palazzo Barberini, Rome) for his palace in Tarquinia.

<text>Tropical medicine is an interdisciplinary branch of medicine that deals with health issues that occur uniquely, are more widespread, or are more difficult to control in tropical and subtropical regions.

Physicians in this field diagnose and treat a variety of diseases and ailments. Most infections they deal with are endemic to the tropics. A few of the most well-known include malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. They must be knowledgeable in the 18 lesser known neglected tropical diseases, which include Chagas disease, rabies, and dengue. Poor living conditions in developing regions of tropical countries have led to a rising number of non-communicable diseases as well as the prevalence of neglected tropical diseases. These diseases include cancer and cardiovascular disease, which, in the past, have been more of a worry in developed countries. Physicians trained in tropical medicine must also be prepared to diagnose and treat these diseases.

Training for physicians wishing to specialize in tropical medicine varies widely over the different countries. They must study epidemiology, virology, parasitology, and statistics, as well as the training required of an ordinary MD. Research on tropical diseases and how to treat them comes from both field research and research centers, including those of the military.

Sir Patrick Manson is recognized as the father of tropical medicine. He founded the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine in 1899. He is credited with discovering the vector by which elephantiasis was being passed to humans. He learned it was a microscopic nematode worm called &quot;Filaria sanguinis hominis&quot;. He continued to study this worm and its life cycle and determined the worms underwent metamorphosis within female &quot;Culex fatigans&quot; mosquitoes. Thus he discovered mosquitoes as a vector for elephantiasis. After this discovery, he collaborated with Ronald Ross to examine the transmission of malaria via mosquito vector. His work with discovering vectors as modes of transmission was critical in the founding of tropical medicine and our current understanding of many tropical diseases.

==Training==
Training in tropical medicine is quite different between countries. Most physicians are trained at institutes of tropical medicine or incorporated into the training of infectious diseases.

In the UK, if a physician wants to specialize in tropical medicine, they must first train in general internal medicine and get accepted into the Royal College of Physicians. They must simultaneously study the specialty of infectious diseases while completing a full-time course load to receive their Diploma of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Their studies are carried out at either the London or Liverpool schools of tropical medicine. Additionally, they must spend two years at one of the UK centers approved for tropical medicine (located in London, Liverpool, or Birmingham). Physicians in the UK who wish to be certified in tropical medicine must spend at least a year abroad in an area lacking resources. Only then can they become certified in tropical medicine.

The training of United States tropical doctors is similar, though it is not a board recognized specialty in America. Physicians must first complete medical school and a program focusing on infectious diseases. Once completed, physicians can take the certification exam from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in order to receive the Certificate of Knowledge in Clinical Tropical Medicine and Travelers&#x27; Health.

==Challenges==
===HIV===
In developing countries alone, 22 million people are living with HIV. Most infections are still in Africa, but Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean are now seeing large numbers of infections as well. 95% of expected new infections will occur in the low-income countries in the tropics. The expected number of new infections is 3-4 million per year. Risk factors such as needle use and unprotected sex are much more prevalent in tropical and underdeveloped areas. Once HIV is transmitted to a tropical area it is spread throughout the sexually active population. Though how fast and how far it spreads varies, some African countries have an HIV prevalence of 10%. More alarming still, in urban areas, prevalence among pregnant women can get as high as 30%. Healthcare professionals themselves are at great risk of exposure to HIV. An HIV prevalence of 10% means any given workforce will also have a 10% prevalence, and this does not exclude the healthcare team. Tuberculosis is thought to cause a more rapid disease progression. Tuberculosis is prevalent in tropical and under-developed countries, only making HIV more devastating. Without the expensive and high-tech medical equipment of developed, western countries, physicians in the tropics are left with few options. If they are able to catch an HIV-related bacterial or mycobacterial disease they can diagnose and manage the disease with basic drugs and standard treatment protocol. Many under-developed countries do not have a care strategy, and of those that do, they aren&#x27;t as effective as they need to be to stop the spread of HIV.

===Malaria===

Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by an &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquito to a human host. The parasite that causes malaria belongs to the genus &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. Once infected, malaria can take a wide variety of forms and symptoms. The disease is placed into the uncomplicated category or the severe category. If quickly diagnosed and treated, malaria can be cured. However, some of the more serious symptoms, such as acute kidney failure, severe anemia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome can be fatal if not dealt with swiftly and properly. Certain types of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; can leave dormant parasites in the liver that can reawaken months or years later, causing additional relapses of the disease. In the &quot;World Malaria Report&quot; of 2016, the World Health Organization reported a malaria infection rate of 212 million, 90% of which occurred in the African region. However, malaria infection rates had fallen 21% since 2010 at the time of the report. The WHO also reported an estimated mortality rate of 429,000 deaths in the year 2015. The malaria mortality rate had fallen 29% globally since 2010. Children under 5 contract the malaria disease more easily than others, and in the year 2015, an estimated 303,000 children under the age of 5 were killed by malaria. Since the year 2010 however, the mortality rate of children under 5 fell by an estimated 35%.

===Tuberculosis===
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that can affect any part of the body, though it primarily affects the lungs. It is a disease that affects the poor and weak, and is far more common in developing countries. TB can either be in its latent or active form. TB can be latent for years, sometimes over a decade. Though TB research receives a mere 1/6th the funding of HIV research, the disease has killed more people in the last 200 years than any other infectious disease. According to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, an estimated 9 million people were infected with TB in the year 2013 alone. That same year 1.5 million people died from TB. Of those 1.5 million, 360,000 were HIV positive. Tuberculosis is extremely expensive to treat, and treatments are now becoming ineffective due to drug-resistant TB strains. In the year 2016, 1.3 million people died from TB. An additional 374,000 people died who were co-infected with both TB and HIV. Research has shown that if the subject is infected with HIV, the risk of latent TB becoming active TB is between 12 and 20 times higher.

===Non-communicable diseases===
Non-communicable diseases are a series of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, injuries, and respiratory diseases, among others. Historically these diseases have plagued developed countries far more than developing countries. In the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2001, it was discovered that 20% of deaths in sub-Saharan Africa were caused by non-communicable diseases. In 2005, the World Health Organization performed a study that showed 80% of chronic disease deaths occurred in low to middle income countries. Non-communicable disease prevalence has been rising in under-developed countries for a variety of reasons. Lack of education and preventive medicine in under-developed countries, along with malnutrition or poor diet lead to many risk factors for non-communicable diseases.

===Neglected tropical diseases===
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 18 tropical diseases, affecting over a billion people worldwide, especially in developing countries. These diseases are heterogeneous, meaning originating outside the organism affected by the disease. NTDs are caused by parasites, viruses, and bacteria. NTDs are neglected because they are not normally fatal on their own but are disabling. Persons with these diseases become more susceptible to other NTDs and fatal diseases such as HIV or malaria.

Neglected tropical diseases effect can be measured in disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Each DALY corresponds to one lost year of healthy life, whether by death or disability. In the year 2010, it was estimated 26.6 million DALYs were lost. In addition to this, it is estimated NTDs cause a loss of 15–30% of productivity in countries that NTDs are endemic too. According to the CDC, 100% of countries categorized as &#x27;low income&#x27; were affected by 5 different NTDs at once.

==Interdisciplinary approach==
Tropical medicine requires an interdisciplinary approach, as the infections and diseases tropical medicine faces are both broad and unique. Tropical medicine requires research and assistance from the fields of epidemiology, microbiology, virology, parasitology, and logistics. Physicians of tropical medicine must have effective communication skills, as many of the patients they interact with do not speak English comfortably. They must be proficient in their knowledge of clinical and diagnostic skills, as they are often without high-tech diagnostic tools when in the field. For example, in an attempt to manage the Chagas disease being brought into the almost Chagas-free Brazilian city São Paulo by Bolivian immigrants, an interdisciplinary team was set up. The Bolivian immigrant population in São Paulo had a prevalence of Chagas disease of 4.4%, while Chagas disease transmission in São Paulo has been under control since the 1970s. This influx of Chagas disease led to an interdisciplinary team being brought together, This team tested the feasibility of managing Chagas disease and transmission at the primary healthcare level. The interdisciplinary team consisted of community health agents and clerical healthcare workers to recruit Chagas infected persons for the study, physicians, nurses, lab workers, and community agents. A pediatrician and cardiologist were also on call. Each were trained in pathology, parasitology, ecoepidemiology, and how to prevent, diagnose, and control Chagas disease. Training from experts in these respective fields was required. They examined reasons for lack of adherence to treatment, and used this knowledge to improve the effectiveness of their interventions. This interdisciplinary approach has been used to train many teams across Brazil in the management of Chagas disease.

Tropical medicine also consists of a preventive approach, especially in an educational aspect. For example, from 2009 to 2011, the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine did an interventional study on a cohort of female sex workers (FSW) in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, a country in Western Africa. 321 HIV-unaffected FSWs were provided with peer-led HIV/STI education, HIV/STI testing and care, psychological support, general healthcare, and services for reproductive health. The same cohort would continue to follow up, quarterly, for 21 months. At each follow-up they were tested for HIV and were able to utilize the preventive interventions if need be. Using models based on the same study population had their been no interventions, the expected prevalence of HIV infections was 1.23 infection per 100 person years. In the actual cohort with access to interventions not a single HIV infection was observed in the collective 409 person-years of follow-up.

==Tropical research in the military==
Throughout history, American military forces have been affected by many tropical diseases. In World War II alone, it was estimated almost one million soldiers had been infected by a tropical disease while serving. Most affected soldiers served in the Pacific, especially in the Philippines and New Guinea. Malaria was especially widespread in the Pacific, though soldiers in Southern Europe and Northern Africa also contracted tropical diseases. Many diseases now known as neglected tropical diseases affected American soldiers as well. These included helminthiasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis was such a problem it caused a $100 million evacuation of U.S. troops out of New Guinea and the Tonga Islands.

In both the Korean and Vietnam Wars the United States army continued to be affected by tropical diseases. The most prevalent diseases to affect their military were malaria and dengue. Hepatitis A, scrub typhus, and hookworm infections were among the other tropical infections picked up by troops in these conflicts.

To combat the significant effects tropical diseases were having on their forces, the United States Military worked hard to develop drugs, vaccines, and other methods of disease control. Research done at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), and various affiliated research centers have greatly improved the military&#x27;s preparedness against tropical disease. In 1967, Captain Robert Phillips earned the Lasker Award for developing a type of IV therapy that reduced cholera&#x27;s fatality rate from 60% to less than 1%. Other interventions licensed by the US Army include vaccines for hepatitis A and Japanese encephalitis. They have also developed the drugs mefloquine and malarone, both used in the treatment of malaria.

Looking forward, the United States military currently has clinical trials testing for vaccines of malaria, adenovirus infection, dengue, and HIV/AIDS underway. However, with massive budget cuts to their military, these research centers are getting less and less funding and have lost many contractors already.

<doc id="1072878" wikidata="Q5020837" url="?curid=1072878" title="2004 California Proposition 60A">
<text>Proposition 60A was an amendment of the Constitution of California, enacted in 2004, relating to funds from the sale of government property. It was proposed by the California Legislature and approved by the voters in a referendum held as part of the November 2004 election, by a majority of 73%.
==Provisions==
The law directed funds collected from the sale of surplus government property toward repaying the $15 billion in bonds authorized by the passage of Proposition 57 in March 2004. The official summary of the proposition reads:

To do this the amendment added to the state constitution Article III, Section 9, stating that

The Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact predicted &quot;Net savings over the longer term-potentially low. Tens of millions of dollars-from accelerated repayment of existing bonds&quot;.

==Process of enactment==

In 2004 the state legislature proposed a constitutional amendment called Senate Constitutional Amendment 18. This contained provisions relating to both primary elections and funds from the sale of government property. This was to be put to voters as a single measure called Proposition 60. However Californians for an Open Primary challenged the measure as a violation of the rule that ballot propositions must deal with only a single subject. The group wished to have Proposition 60 removed from the ballot. Instead, in &quot;Californians for an Open Primary v. Shelley&quot;, the Third District Court of Appeals ordered that the proposition be split, so that the provisions relating to government property would become a separate measure, called Proposition 60A.

Senate Constitutional Amendment 18 (which included the provisions that would become Proposition 60A) was approved by the California Assembly by a vote of 55-21 and by the State Senate by a vote of 28–3. On November 2, 2004, it was approved by the electorate with 7,776,374 (73.3%) votes in favor and 2,843,435 (26.7%) against.

<doc id="1072879" wikidata="Q1943555" url="?curid=1072879" title="Sawdah bint Zam'ah">
<text>Sawdah bint Zamʿah () was the second wife of Muhammad and regarded as &quot;Umm-ul-Mu&#x27;mineen&quot; (Arabic: أمّ المؤمنين, &quot;ʾumm al-muʾminīn&quot;), &quot;Mother of the Believers&quot;.

==Early life==

Sawdah was born and raised in Mecca in Pre-Islamic Arabia. There is a disagreement as to when she was born. According to one source, when she was married to Muhammad, her age was around 50, other sources claim her age during the marriage to be around 40 to 55 years old, which would only narrow her birthday to around 566-580 CE. Her father, Zam&#x27;ah ibn Qays, was from the Banu Amir ibn Lu&#x27;ayy clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. Her mother, Al-Shamus bint Qays, was from the Najjar clan of the Khazraj tribe in Madina.

==First husband and first Hijra==

She married As-Sakran ibn Amr, who was one of the early converts to Islam. They had two sons, Abdur Rahman ibn as-Sakran and Abd ibn as-Sakran, who much later died in the Battle of Jalula in 637 against the Sassanids.

===Migration to Abyssinia===
Sawdah and Sakran emigrated to Abyssinia when Muhammad ordered many of the Muslims to perform Hijra in order to avoid persecution by the Quraysh. Sakran left for Abyssinia by sea with Waqqas. Sawdah was one of the first women to immigrate to Abyssinia in the way of Allah. A few years later they returned to Mecca, where As-Sakran died, and she became a widow for the first time in her life.

==Marriage to Muhammad==

Soon after Khadija&#x27;s death, Muhammad married Sawdah in the same month of Ramadan of the 10th year after the start of his prophethood. Sawdah was hesitant to accept at first, as she already had six children and feared that they would disturb Muhammad. But Muhammad convinced her by saying, “The best women ever to have ridden the backs of camels are the virtuous women of the Quraysh, who are the most affectionate toward small children and the most excellent in doing good to their husbands when they [the women] are wealthy.”

When Sawdah became old, some time after Muhammad&#x27;s marriage to Umm Salama, and Qur’an 4:128–9 was revealed. Other traditions, on the other hand, hold that Muhammad did not truly repudiate her but that she was afraid he would, and it was not repudiation that was being considered in the verse revelation but rather some kind of compromise on the divorce so long as she could remain his wife in name.

==Later life and death==

After the death of Muhammad, Sawdah along with other wives received a gift of money annually from the Caliphate, which she spent on charity. She, Aisha, Hafsa, and Safiyya always remained very close. She lived a long life and died in 54 AH in Medina, where she was buried in Jannat-al-Baqi. Ibn Sa&#x27;d puts her date of death to the year 674. After her death, Muawiyah I, the reigning first caliph of the Umayyad dynasty, bought her house in Medina for 180,000 &quot;dirhams&quot;. According to other sources, she died in Medina towards the end of caliph &#x27;Umar&#x27;s reign in 22 AH, 644 CE.

<doc id="1072889" wikidata="Q407364" url="?curid=1072889" title="Superacid">
<text>In chemistry, a superacid (according to the original definition) is an acid with an acidity greater than that of 100% pure sulfuric acid (), which has a Hammett acidity function (&quot;H&quot;0) of −12. According to the modern definition, a superacid is a medium in which the chemical potential of the proton is higher than in pure sulfuric acid. Commercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (), also known as triflic acid, and fluorosulfuric acid (), both of which are about a thousand times stronger (i.e. have more negative &quot;H&quot;0 values) than sulfuric acid. Most strong superacids are prepared by the combination of a strong Lewis acid and a strong Brønsted acid. A strong superacid of this kind is fluoroantimonic acid. Another group of superacids, the carborane acid group, contains some of the strongest known acids. Finally, when treated with anhydrous acid, zeolites (microporous aluminosilicate minerals) will contain superacidic sites within their pores. These materials are used on massive scale by the petrochemical industry in the upgrading of hydrocarbons to make fuels.

==History==
The term &quot;superacid&quot; was originally coined by James Bryant Conant in 1927 to describe acids that were stronger than conventional mineral acids. This definition was refined by Ronald Gillespie in 1971, as any acid with an &quot;H&quot;0 value lower than that of 100% sulfuric acid (−11.93). George A. Olah prepared the so-called &quot;magic acid&quot;, so named for its ability to attack hydrocarbons, by mixing antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) and fluorosulfonic acid (FSO3H). The name was coined after a candle was placed in a sample of magic acid after a Christmas party. The candle dissolved, showing the ability of the acid to protonate alkanes, which under normal acidic conditions do not protonate to any extent.

At 140 °C (284 °F), FSO3H–SbF5 protonates methane to give the tertiary-butyl carbocation, a reaction that begins with the protonation of methane:
: CH4 + H+ → 
: → + H2
: + 3 CH4 → (CH3)3C+ + 3H2

Common uses of superacids include providing an environment to create, maintain, and characterize carbocations. Carbocations are intermediates in numerous useful reactions such as those forming plastics and in the production of high-octane gasoline.

==Origin of extreme acid strength==
Traditionally, superacids are made from mixing a Brønsted acid with a Lewis acid. The function of the Lewis acid is to bind to and stabilize the anion that is formed upon dissociation of the Brønsted acid, thereby removing a proton acceptor from the solution and strengthening the proton donating ability of the solution. For example, fluoroantimonic acid, nominally (), can produce solutions with a &quot;H&quot;0 lower than –28, giving it a protonating ability over a billion times greater than 100% sulfuric acid. Fluoroantimonic acid is made by dissolving antimony pentafluoride (SbF5) in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF). In this mixture, HF releases its proton (H+) concomitant with the binding of F− by the antimony pentafluoride. The resulting anion () delocalizes charge effectively and holds onto its electron pairs tightly, making it an extremely poor nucleophile and base. The mixture owes its extraordinary acidity to the weakness of proton acceptors (and electron pair donors) (Brønsted or Lewis bases) in solution. Because of this, the protons in fluoroantimonic acid and other superacids are popularly described as &quot;naked&quot;, being readily donated to substances not normally regarded as proton acceptors, like the C–H bonds of hydrocarbons. However, even for superacidic solutions, protons in the condensed phase are far from being unbound. For instance, in fluoroantimonic acid, they are bound to one or more molecules of hydrogen fluoride. Though hydrogen fluoride is normally regarded as an exceptionally weak proton acceptor (though a somewhat better one than the SbF6– anion), dissociation of its protonated form, the fluoronium ion H2F+ to HF and the truly naked H+ is still a highly endothermic process (Δ&quot;G&quot;° = +113 kcal/mol), and imagining the proton in the condensed phase as being &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;unbound&quot;, like charged particles in a plasma, is highly inaccurate and misleading.

More recently, carborane acids have been prepared as single component superacids that owe their strength to the extraordinary stability of the carboranate anion, a family of anions stabilized by three-dimensional aromaticity, as well as by electron-withdrawing group typically attached thereto.

In superacids, the proton is shuttled rapidly from proton acceptor to proton acceptor by tunneling through a hydrogen bond via the Grotthuss mechanism, just as in other hydrogen-bonded networks, like water or ammonia.

==Applications==
In petrochemistry, superacidic media are used as catalysts, especially for alkylations. Typical catalysts are sulfated oxides of titanium and zirconium or specially treated alumina or zeolites. The solid acids are used for alkylating benzene with ethene and propene as well as difficult acylations, e.g. of chlorobenzene. In organic chemistry, superacids are used as a means of protonating alkanes to promote the use of carbocations in situ during reactions. The resulting carbocations are of much use in organic synthesis of numerous organic compounds, the high acidity of the superacids helps to stabilize the highly reactive and unstable carbocations for future reactions.

==Examples==
The following are examples of superacids. Each is listed with its Hammett acidity function, where a smaller value of &quot;H&quot;0 (in these cases, more negative) indicates a stronger acid.

* Fluoroantimonic acid (HF:SbF5, &quot;H&quot;0 = -28)
* Magic acid (HSO3F:SbF5, &quot;H&quot;0 = −23)
* Carborane acids (H(HCB11X11), &quot;H&quot;0 ≤ −18, indirectly determined and depends on substituents)
* Fluoroboric acid (HF:BF3, &quot;H&quot;0 = −16.6)
* Bistriflimidic acid (NH(CF3SO2)2, &quot;H&quot;0 = -15.8. Estimated value calculated from pKa values in 1,2-dichloroethane in comparison to triflic acid)
* Fluorosulfuric acid (FSO3H, &quot;H&quot;0 = −15.1)
* Hydrogen fluoride (HF, &quot;H&quot;0 = −15.1)
* Triflic acid (HOSO2CF3, &quot;H&quot;0 = −14.9)
* Oleum (SO3:H2SO4, &quot;H&quot;0 = −14.5)
* Perchloric acid (HClO4, &quot;H&quot;0 = −13)
* Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, &quot;H&quot;0 = −11.9)

<text>Zaynab bint Khuzayma () ( 596 – 625), also known as Umm al-Masākīn (, &quot;Mother of the Poor&quot;), was the fifth wife of Muhammad. As a result of her early death, less is known about her than about his other wives.

==Early life==
Zaynab was the first of Muhammad’s wives who was not from the Quraysh tribe. Her father, Khuzayma ibn al-Harith, was from the Hilal tribe in Mecca. Her mother is sometimes said to have been Hind bint Awf, but this tradition is weak.

Her first husband was her cousin, Jahm ibn ‘Amr ibn al-Harith.

While Zaynab was still a polytheist, she acquired a reputation for extreme generosity. &quot;She was called &#x27;Mother of the Beggars&#x27; because of her kindness to them and her pity for them.&quot;

It is not known exactly when Zaynab converted to Islam, but her second husband was a prominent Muslim, Abdullah ibn Jahsh. This marriage must have ended in divorce, since Zaynab was already remarried at the time of Abdullah’s death; and she is not listed among the people whom he took to Medina in 622.

Zaynab&#x27;s next husband was Tufayl ibn al-Harith, a Muslim from the Muttalib clan; but this marriage also ended in divorce.

Afterwards Zaynab married Tufayl&#x27;s brother, Ubayda, who was more than thirty years older than herself. In 622 they joined the general emigration to Medina, where they lived on a plot of land that was shared with Ubayda&#x27;s two brothers. Ubayda was killed at the Battle of Badr in March 624, and Zaynab remained a widow for nearly a year.

==Marriage to Muhammad==
There are conflicting reports as to whether Zaynab was &quot;beautiful&quot; and refused many offers of marriage or whether she was shunned. However, in February 625 her cousin Qubaysa (brother of her first husband) arranged for her to marry Muhammad, who gave her a dower of either 400 &quot;dirhams&quot; or 12½ &quot;aowqiyas&quot;. This was about a month after his marriage to Hafsa bint Umar.

It has been suggested that Muhammad proposed or agreed to the match in order to provide for a deserving widow who would otherwise have been reduced to poverty. It was said the marriage was meant to reassure his followers that their deaths in battle would not mean their families would starve and be neglected. An alternative suggestion is that the marriage was politically motivated, &quot;cultivating good relations with her own tribe of ‘Amir b. Sa’sa’ah.&quot;

One story about their married life tells how a poor man came to Zaynab’s house to beg for some flour. She gave him the last of what she had and had no food for herself that night. Moved by her compassion, Muhammad told his other wives about it, saying: &quot;If you have faith in Allah ... he will provide for your sustenance even as he does for the birds, who leave their nest hungry in the morning but return full at night&quot;.

==Death==
Zaynab&#x27;s marriage to Muhammad lasted only a few months. She died at aged about thirty. Muhammad carried her to Jannat al-Baqi and recited the funeral prayers, then three of her brothers descended into her grave to lay the corpse.

Her house at the mosque remained empty for six months until Muhammad&#x27;s sixth wife, Umm Salama, was moved into it.

<text>Proposition 61 was a California ballot proposition on the November 2, 2004 ballot. It passed with 6,629,095 (58.3%) votes in favor and 4,750,309 (41.7%) against. The proposition was the result of an initiative and authorized the sale of $750 million in bonds to provide funding for children&#x27;s hospitals. It was officially known as the Children&#x27;s Hospital Bond Act of 2004.
==Official summary==
*Authorizes $750,000,000 in general obligation bonds, to be repaid from state&#x27;s General Fund, for grants to eligible children&#x27;s hospitals for construction, expansion, remodeling, renovation, furnishing and equipping children&#x27;s hospitals.
*20% of bonds are for grants to specified University of California general acute care hospitals; 80% of bonds are for grants to general acute care hospitals that focus on children with illnesses such as leukemia, heart defects, sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis, provide comprehensive services to a high volume of children eligible for government programs, and that meet other stated requirements.
Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:
*State cost of about $1.5 billion over 30 years to pay off both the principal ($750 million) and the interest ($756 million) costs of the bonds. Payments of about $50 million per year.

<doc id="1072894" wikidata="Q2128751" url="?curid=1072894" title="Nitrogen-13">
<text>Nitrogen-13 (13N) is a radioisotope of nitrogen used in positron emission tomography (PET). It has a half-life of a little under ten minutes, so it must be made at the PET site. A cyclotron may be used for this purpose.

Nitrogen-13 is used to tag ammonia molecules for PET myocardial perfusion imaging.

==Production==
Nitrogen-13 is used in medical PET imaging in the form of 13N-labelled ammonia. It can be produced with a medical cyclotron, using a target of pure water with a trace amount of ethanol. The reactants are oxygen-16 (present as H2O) and a proton, and the products are nitrogen-13 and an alpha particle (helium-4).

:1H + 16O → 13N + 4He

The proton must be accelerated to have total energy greater than 5.66 MeV. This is the threshold energy for this reaction, as it is endothermic (i.e., the mass of the products is greater than the reactants, so energy needs to be supplied which is converted to mass). For this reason, the proton needs to carry extra energy to induce the nuclear reaction.

The energy difference is actually 5.22 MeV, but if the proton only supplied this energy, the reactants would be formed with no kinetic energy. As momentum must be conserved, the true energy that needs to be supplied by the proton is given by:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the mass of 4He and formula_3 is the mass of 13N ; therefore formula_4 = 0,307 806 661. The presence of ethanol (at a concentration of ~5mM) in aqueous solution allows the convenient formation of ammonia as nitrogen-13 is produced. Other routes of producing 13N-labelled ammonia exist, some of which facilitate co-generation of other light radionuclides for diagnostic imaging.
Nitrogen-13 plays a significant role in the CNO cycle, which is the dominant source of energy in main-sequence stars more massive than 1.5 times the mass of the Sun.

Lightning may have a role in the production of nitrogen-13.

<doc id="1072896" wikidata="Q772045" url="?curid=1072896" title="The American Voter">
<text>The American Voter, published in 1960, is a seminal study of voting behavior in the United States, authored by Angus Campbell, Philip Converse, Warren Miller, and Donald E. Stokes, colleagues at the University of Michigan. Among its controversial conclusions, based on one of the first comprehensive studies of election survey data (what eventually became the National Election Studies), is that most voters cast their ballots primarily on the basis of partisan identification (which is often simply inherited from their parents), and that independent voters are actually the least involved in and attentive to politics. This theory of voter choice became known as the Michigan Model. It was later extended to the United Kingdom by David Butler and Donald Stokes in &quot;Political change in Britain&quot;. 

&quot;The American Voter&quot; established a baseline for most of the scholarly debate that has followed in the decades since. Criticism has followed along several different lines. Some argue that Campbell and his colleagues set the bar too high, expecting voters to be far more sophisticated and rational than is reasonable. Some scholars, most notably V. O. Key, Jr., in &quot;The Responsible Electorate&quot;, have argued, in part based on reinterpretation of the same data, that voters are more rational than &quot;The American Voter&quot; gives them credit for. His famous line &quot;Voters are not fools&quot; summarizes this view. Successors in the Michigan school have argued that in relying heavily on data from the 1956 presidential election, &quot;The American Voter&quot; drew conclusions that were not accurate over time; in particular, partisan identification has weakened in the years since 1956, a phenomenon sometimes known as dealignment (see political realignment).

&quot;The American Voter&quot; has served as a springboard from which many modern political scientists form their views on voting behavior even though the study only represents one specific time in one particular place.

Warren Miller (d. 1999) and Merrill Shanks from the University of California, Berkeley have revisited many of these questions in &quot;The New American Voter&quot; (1996), which argues against the dealignment notion, preferring the term &quot;nonalignment&quot; based on their conclusion that the decline in partisan identification is mostly a matter of new voters not aligning with a party rather than older voters abandoning their previous allegiances.

Sowry was born in Palmerston North, and attended Tararua College in Pahiatua where he was head boy. His education included an American Field Service exchange to Minnesota in 1977, and a Diploma of Business Administration from Victoria University of Wellington. After working for a time at the Valuation Department, Sowry was employed by Hannahs, shoe manufacturers and retailers as a retail manager. He is Anglican, and married with four children.

==Member of Parliament==


Sowry joined the National Party in 1977, and was active in its youth wing. In the 1987 election, beat out anti-abortion activist Marilyn Pryor for the National candidacy to challenge Labour Party MP Margaret Shields in the Kapiti electorate. The challenge was unsuccessful, but a second attempt in the 1990 election was successful; he defeated Shields and entered Parliament. Sowry kept the seat until the 1996 election, when he unsuccessfully contested the new Otaki seat against Labour&#x27;s Judy Keall and became a list MP.

In 1993, Sowry was appointed as his party&#x27;s Junior Whip, and in 1995, he became Senior Whip.

===Member of Cabinet===
In December 1996, he was elevated to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Social Welfare. In 1998, the role was reorganized, becoming Minister of Social Services, Work and Income. He also served for a time as Minister in charge of War Pensions, Minister responsible for the Housing Corporation (state housing), and Associate Minister of Health. In January 1999, he was given special responsibility for co-ordinating National&#x27;s relationship with the groups that it relied upon for support (Mauri Pacific, Mana Wahine, and others).

In October 2001, when Bill English displaced Jenny Shipley as leader of the National Party, Sowry (who had played a significant role in English&#x27;s rise) became National&#x27;s deputy leader. He remained in this position until English himself was displaced by Don Brash in October 2003.

==Resignation==
On 13 July 2004, Sowry announced that he would not seek re-election, saying that he was looking for a change of career. Sowry denied there were tensions between himself and the party&#x27;s new leadership. Brash publicly praised Sowry&#x27;s &quot;outstanding contribution&quot; over the years.

Until 2008 he was the Chief Executive of Arthritis New Zealand, subsequently moving to Saunders Unsworth, as a consultant on Government matters.

In the 2011 New Year Honours, Sowry was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services as a Member of Parliament. In 2013, Sowry was appointed a member of the Representation Commission to determine New Zealand electoral boundaries.

<doc id="1072906" wikidata="Q25666973" url="?curid=1072906" title="Pillar coral">
<text>Pillar coral (Dendrogyra cylindrus) is a hard coral (order Scleractinia) found in the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Dendrogyra. It is a digitate coral -that is, it resembles fingers (Latin &quot;digites&quot;) or a cluster of cigars, growing up from the sea floor without any secondary branching. It is large and can grow on both flat and sloping surfaces at depths down to 20 m (65 ft). It is one of the few types of hard coral in which the polyps can commonly be seen feeding during the day.

==Description==
Pillar coral forms an encrusted base from which grow vertical cylindrical, round-ended columns. This coral can grow to a height of with pillars more than wide but is usually much smaller than this. The corallites from which the polyps protrude are smaller than in diameter and arranged in shallow meandering valleys with low ridges in between. The skeleton of the coral is not usually visible because the polyps are typically extended during the daytime, unlike most other coral species. The mass of undulating tentacles gives the coral a furry appearance. This coral is usually some shade of beige or brown.
==Distribution and habitat==
Pillar corals are found in the warmer parts of the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Within its range, &quot;D. cylindrus&quot; is common in some places, but rare in other seemingly suitable locations. Some of the islands in the Bahamas have plentiful numbers of colonies as does the north coast of Jamaica. It used to be common on the reefs off the coast of Florida but has suffered from over-collection there. It seems to be absent from Bermuda and the coasts of Panama and Colombia. It usually grows on level or slightly sloping parts of the reef at depths between .

==Biology==
Pillar coral is a zooxanthellate species, with symbiotic dinoflagellate algae living within the tissues. In sunlight these undergo photosynthesis and most of the organic compounds they produce are transferred to their host, while they make use of the coral&#x27;s nitrogenous wastes. These algae give the coral its brownish colour and restrict it to living in shallow water into which the sunlight can penetrate.

Pillar coral is a slow-growing, long-lived species. A number of columns grow up from a basal plate; if the whole colony is dislodged and topples over, new cylindrical pillars can grow vertically from the fallen coral. Some specimens have been found where this has happened more than once, and the history of the colony can be deduced from its shape. If a pillar gets detached and becomes lodged in a suitable position, it can continue to live, sending up new pillars from the base and other parts of the column.

Each pillar coral clonal colony is either male or female, an evolutionary life history strategy described as gonochoric. However, hermaphroditic events have been recorded for the species. Sexual reproduction takes place with gametes being released into the water column where fertilisation takes place. The larvae that develop from the eggs are planktonic and drift with the currents before settling on the seabed to found new colonies.

==Status==
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists pillar coral as being Critically Endangered under criteria A2bce. This is because recruitment and survival rates of juveniles is low and this coral is particularly susceptible to both bleaching and white plague disease. It is resistant to strong wave action but can be wrecked by hurricanes and tropical storms. However, broken fragments regenerate well. Some of the localities in which it is found are in marine parks and in these it should be safe from human disturbance. In addition, the advent of stony coral tissue loss disease in Florida and the Caribbean is causing local extinctions and may have species-level effects on this species as it is infected at an early stage of the disease progression. Finally, it is a gonochoric species which was never particularly common within its range, making its reproductive potential lower than might otherwise be expected.

The species is functionally extinct in Florida, USA, and mostly survives in captivity.

<doc id="1072910" wikidata="Q3104313" url="?curid=1072910" title="Gerringong, New South Wales">
<text>Gerringong () is a town located about ten minutes drive south of Kiama, and about twenty minutes north of Nowra in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia in the Municipality of Kiama. At the , Gerringong had a population of 4,165. One theory says that the name derives from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;fearful place&quot;.

== History ==
Aboriginal people of the Dharawal language group are the original inhabitants and traditional custodians of the area now known as Gerringong and its surroundings.

The first Europeans to pass through the district on land were probably survivors of the wreck of the &quot;Sydney Cove&quot; who trekked more than 700 km along the coast, during 1797. George Bass explored the nearby coast, later in 1797, during his voyage that revealed the existence of the Shoalhaven River to the colonial settlers.

The first Europeans working in the area were red cedar cutters, who were first recorded as having visited and logged in the area in 1814. As in much of coastal New South Wales, the cleared land was used for dairy farming and cedar cutting died out, as the cedar trees disappeared. Dairy farming became the predominant primary industry and remains so to this day. Gerringong had a small boat harbour used for the export of cedar and dairy produce.

The Surveyor-General John Oxley and Assistant Surveyor-General James Meehan led two separate but concurrent expeditions passing through the Gerringong area in late 1819. Oxley proceeded down the coast by sea to the Shoalhaven. Meehan went overland, starting from the Minnamurra River and meeting Oxley at the Shoalhaven. Oxley&#x27;s report of good soil in the area increased interest in agricultural settlement.

In 1824, Governor Brisbane reserved 600 acres (2.4 km2) for the present Gerringong township. In 1827, Michael Hindmarsh and his family were granted 640 acres (2.6 km2) and became the first settler in the Gerringong area. In 1829, Gerringong was incorporated into the postal system.

Aboriginal people in the area of Gerringong continued to state their ownership of it—including Hindmarsh&#x27;s grant—in the 1840s. By then, the settlers&#x27; clearing of the sub-tropical rainforest was transforming the landscape completely—to lush pastures suited to dairy cattle—and depriving the original inhabitants of the land, environment and land-based food sources upon which they had depended for thousands of years. Effectively barred from private land, they were confined to unalienated &#x27;government&#x27; land.

Alne Bank homestead was built in 1851 for the Hindmarsh family, who still live there today and occasionally open it for inspection.

In 1854, a town plan for Gerringong was approved and the Governor proclaimed it a village. In 1872, the business area, Church of England church and some houses were destroyed by a bush fire.

In the late 1860s and 1870s, locals advocated the erection of a jetty at the Boatharbour. In 1880 a 200-foot-long jetty was completed but it was too short to allow coastal ships to berth. One ship that did call there was &quot;Dairy Maid&quot;, a small wooden-hulled steamer built in the Rock Davis shipyard. The jetty was extended, in the mid-1880s, first by 200-feet and subsequently another 100 feet. The 500-foot-long jetty was extensively damaged in fierce storms in 1891. It was rebuilt but, during that work, was damaged again by stormy weather in 1892, necessitating more repairs. A new crane was installed in 1893. The jetty was probably used to land materials for railway construction.

In 1893, the South Coast railway line was extended to Gerringong, leading to the end of shipping from the town. The disused jetty was given to the local council, for use as bridge material, around 1901. The last standing remnants of the jetty were washed away in 1904.

By 1897, the dispossession was complete; local Aborigines had &quot;dwindled to a handful&quot; living in a camp just south-west of Gerringong, at Crooked River and another camp at &#x27;Ooirie Creek&#x27; (now Ooarie Creek) near Omega, whose inhabitants were later relocated. The lives of the surviving Aborigines were, for many years, controlled by the Aborigines Protection Board, and subject to the disdain of many—if not all—white inhabitants.

Telephone services were extended to Gerringong by June 1915 and electricity was connected in 1928.

In 1954, Gerringong Municipal District amalgamated with Kiama Municipal Council. The town water supply was connected in 1971, signalling an end to tanks attached to each house. Land along the coastal fringe tends to receive higher rainfall than the interior water catchment areas, which are often in rainshadow. In 2002, the town sewerage system was connected.

== Modern Gerringong==
At the , Gerringong and the surrounding area had a population of 4,165. There is still an Aboriginal presence in Gerringong. In 2021, 2.8% of the population identified as indigenous.

The main local industries are agriculture (including dairying and vineyards), tourism and retail trade. Others enjoy the seaside lifestyle but commute to work in Wollongong or Nowra and even Sydney.

The town has a modern primary school, a town hall (built 1948), a large retirement village and a tourist industry. Especially in the summer months, when visitors (mostly from Sydney and Canberra) attend the beaches for swimming, surfing, fishing and the restaurants and cafés. There are two vineyards.

The Gerringong and District Historical Society runs the Heritage Museum, containing scale models of buildings, a photographic record of motor racing on Seven Mile Beach in the 1920s, and a display on the local dairying industry.

==Transport==
Gerringong railway station is served by NSW TrainLink&#x27;s South Coast Line. Services are provided by diesel trains, which connect with electric trains to Sydney at Kiama. Local bus companies connect Gerringong to Kiama and Nowra on a daily basis, and interstate buses connect it with Sydney and Melbourne and all stops in between.

In 2012, a major Princes Highway upgrade commenced in Gerringong. The upgrade provides 7.5 kilometres of upgraded highway and includes two new interchanges with access to Gerringong and Gerroa. This major infrastructure project includes a new overpass over the Omega rail level crossing, major highway widening, additional exits, and safer on and off ramps. The $329 million upgrade was officially opened on 20 August 2015.

== Geography ==

The boundaries of the Gerringong District range from Mount Pleasant and Omega in the north, to Rose Valley, Willow Vale and Foxground in the west, and to Broughton Village, Toolijooa, Harley Hill, Gerroa and Seven Mile Beach in the south. In the centre of the area lies the town of Gerringong itself, and the nearby area of Werri Beach.

The Kiama and Gerringong area is marketed as &quot;Where the Mountains Meet the Sea&quot; by Kiama Council. A spur of Saddleback Mountain reaches down to Mt Pleasant to the north of Gerringong township, ending the Illawarra escarpment, which starts north of Wollongong. The area is famous for its coastline, which includes sea cliffs, beaches surrounded by rolling hills and countryside that stays green year-round.

The spur of Saddlback Mountain that separates Gerringong from Kiama was very significant in the town&#x27;s history. The steep road over the spur made using the port of Kiama difficult. Gerringong would need its own small port, until the railway from Kiama opened in 1893 after tunnels were cut through the basalt rock of the spur.

The Princes Highway bypasses Gerringong township on its western edge, with two exits, one at Fern St and an underpass at Belinda Street, 2 km further south. Gerringong and Werri Beach were previously two separate localities, but have now grown together without any definitive boundary.

Werri Lagoon, which sometimes empties to the sea at the northern end of Werri Beach, used to naturally exit near the Gerringong Surf Club at the south end, until human intervention occurred in the 1960s. Bridges Road used to be access to a bridge which provided access to Werri Beach.

Werri Lagoon is now part of the Kiama Coast Walk, which stretches from Loves Bay, north of Kiama, to Werri Lagoon. The walking track extends for six kilometres and took eleven years to prepare and construct. It opened in October 2009.

Gerringong&#x27;s Boatharbour—its traditional spelling—was used extensively for shipping timber and dairy produce in the 19th century. The Boatharbour provides little shelter from a black nor&#x27;easter and relatively little from the heavy seas associated with an east coast low. There is a boat ramp there and it is the location of Gerringong&#x27;s ocean swimming pool.

Gerringong&#x27;s geology is basically basalt, emplaced in the Permian period. 

=== Climate ===
Gerringong is the most northerly coastal town that is entirely within an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), although it is at a dominated latitude of subtropical climates along the coast the low average record temperatures are more similar to the second category. The city has warm summers and mild winters. Rainfall is spread relatively evenly throughout the year with the wettest months being in autumn and the driest in spring.

== Politics ==
Gerringong is part of the Municipality of Kiama. Local residents are represented by the Member of NSW Parliament for Kiama, currently Gareth Ward. The area is represented by the Federal Member for Gilmore, currently Fiona Phillips.

<doc id="1072911" wikidata="Q42104" url="?curid=1072911" title="Umm Salama">
<text>Hind bint Abi Umayya (, Hind ʾibnat ʾAbī ʾUmayya, 580 or 596 – 680 or 683), better known as Umm Salamah () or Hind al-Makhzūmiyya () was the sixth wife of Muhammad.

&quot;Umm Salama&quot; was her &quot;kunya&quot; meaning, &quot;mother of Salama&quot;. She was one of the most influential female companions of Muhammad. She is recognized largely for recalling numerous Hadiths, or sayings and narrations attributed to Muhammad. Shia Muslims believe that Umm Salama was Muhammad&#x27;s most important wife after Khadija.

==Before marriage with Muhammad==

Umm Salama&#x27;s birth name was Hind. Her father was Abu Umayya ibn Al-Mughira ibn Abdullah ibn Umar ibn Makhzum ibn Yaqazah also known as Suhayl or Zad ar-Rakib. He was an elite member of the Quraysh tribe, known for his great generosity, especially to travelers. Her mother was &#x27;Ātikah bint &#x27;Āmir ibn Rabī&#x27;ah, of the Firas ibn Ghanam branch of the Kinana.

===Marriage to Abu Salama===
Before her marriage to Muhammad, Umm Salama was married to Abu Salama Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Asad, whose mother was Barrah bint Abdul Muttalib. Abu Salama was Muhammad&#x27;s foster brother and one of his close companions. Umm Salama bore with Abu Salama four children: Salama, Umar, Zaynab and Ruqayyah.

===Conversion to Islam===
Umm Salama and her husband Abu Salama were among the first who converted to Islam. Only Ali and a few others were Muslims before them. Despite intense anger and persecution from the powerful Quraysh in response to their conversion to Islam, Umm Salama and Abu Salama continued their devotion to Islam.

As the persecution grew in severity, the new Muslims began to look for life away from Mecca. Muhammad instructed his newly converted followers, including Umm Salama and Abu Salama, to make a migration to Abyssinia. Umm Salama abandoned her honorable life in her clan in Mecca to migrate. While in Abyssinia, these Muslims were told that there had been a decrease in persecution along with an increase in numbers of Muslims in Mecca. This information caused Umm Salama, her husband, and the rest of the Muslim emigrants to travel back to Mecca. Upon their return to Mecca, the Quraysh again began viciously persecuting the Muslims. In response, Muhammad gave his followers instructions to make a migration to Medina, also known as the hijrah. Umm Salama, along with her husband and son planned to make the hijra together, however this was stopped when Umm Salama&#x27;s clan forced her to stay in Mecca, while Abu Salama&#x27;s clan took the child.

Umm Salama recounted this story: 
Abu Salama made the trip to Medina alone, leaving his wife and child in Mecca. After some time, Umm Salama was permitted by the Quraysh to leave Mecca, and was given her son back by her husband&#x27;s tribe. With her son, she completed the hijra and was reconnected with her husband.

===Death of Abu Salama===

During her marriage to Abu Salamah, Umm Salamah (in a story related by Ziyad ibn Abi Maryam) is said to have asked her husband to make agreement that when either of them died, the other would not remarry. However, in this tradition, Abu Salamah responded by instructing Umm Salamah to remarry after his death. He then prayed, &quot;O God, provide Umm Salamah after me with a better man than me who will not grieve her or injure her!&quot;

During the Battle of Uhud (March 625), Abu Salamah was severely injured. While Abu Salamah was dying due to these wounds, he recalled a story to Umm Salamah involving a message he had heard from Muhammad: &quot;I heard the Messenger of God saying, &#x27;Whenever a calamity afflicts anyone he should say, &quot;Surely from God we are and to Him we shall certainly return.&quot;&#x27; And he would pray, &#x27;O Lord, give me in return something better from it which only You, Exalted and Mighty can give&#x27;&quot;. This traditional story has been transmitted with various differences, but the fundamental principles of the hadith remain intact.

Her husband eventually died from the wounds he received in the Battle of Uhud. Umm Salamah remembered the hadith recalled by her husband prior to his death, and began reciting the given prayer.

Following Abdullah ibn Abdulasad&#x27;s death in the battle of Uhud she became known as &quot;Ayyin al-Arab&quot; - &quot;the one who had lost her husband&quot;. She had no family in Medina except her small children, but she was given support by both the Muhajirun and Ansar. After finishing the iddah of four months and ten days, the prescribed period that a woman must wait after the death of her husband before she can remarry, Umm Salama got offers of marriage. Abu Bakr and then Umar asked to marry her, but she declined. Muhammad himself then proposed to Umm Salama. She initially hesitated, stating, &quot;O Messenger of Allah, I have three characteristics. I am a woman who is extremely jealous and I am afraid that you will see in me something that will anger you and cause Allah to punish me. I am a woman who is already advanced in age and I am a woman who has a young family.&quot;

However, Muhammad appeased each of her concerns, &quot;Regarding the jealousy you mentioned, I pray to Allah the Almighty to let it go away from you. Regarding the question of age you have mentioned, I am afflicted with the same problem as you. Regarding the dependent family you have mentioned, your family is my family.&quot;

==Muhammad&#x27;s era==

Umm Salama was married to Muhammad at the age of 32. Umm Salamah was a widow with 3 children and a fourth born almost immediately after their marriage.

When Fatimah bint Asad (mother of the 4th Caliph Ali) died, Muhammad is said to have chosen Umm Salama as the guardian of Fatimah bint Muhammad. However, the latter Fatimah is thought to have married Ali in 1 AH or 2 AH, Fatimah bint Asad died in 4 AH, and Umm Salama married Muhammad in year 5, so any guardianship must have been purely nominal.

The verse of purification (33:33) in the Qur&#x27;an was revealed to Muhammad in her house.

===Umm Salama and the wives of Muhammad===
In the fourth year following the migration to Medina (4 AH), Umm Salama accepted a marriage proposal from Muhammad. After sharing her three reservations about the marriage, and hearing the response from Muhammad, Umm Salama was so pleased that she accepted the proposal. Umm Salama became the eldest of all of Muhammad&#x27;s wives. She became the second highest-ranking wife of Muhammad along Ayesha, only behind Khadija. Her elevated status among the rest of the wives was a result of her presence in many wars and her defense of the household of Muhammad. Attributes that distinguish Umm Salama from the rest of the wives of Muhammad include the following: Her role in Fatimah&#x27;s upbringing (who Umm Salama proclaimed displayed more knowledge than ever herself in all affairs), her political activism, her accounts of Muhammad&#x27;s narrations, and her unwavering defense of Ali&#x27;s personality and leadership following Muhammad&#x27;s death.

The greatest attribute of the wives of Muhammad is demonstrated as being known as the &quot;Mothers of the believers&quot;. They were also prohibited from marrying another man ever again. (33:53) The Qur&#x27;an indicates that the wives of Muhammad had to be role models in society (33:30-32). She was often looked up to by the rest of the wives of Muhammad due to her intelligence and political knowledge. Umm Salama herself narrated 378 Hadith, among them being some of the most important. She was the last of the wives of Muhammad to pass away.

===Impact on Muhammad and society===
Because of her beauty, knowledge, and wisdom, Umm Salama held a prominent role in the house of Muhammad and society. She was an exceptional wife of Muhammad in her faith and morals. As a woman, she carried out and completed all of her religious duties. During her marriage to Muhammad, she strived to keep him happy. She always held the utmost respect for him. She was known in society for her intelligence, political savvy, and activity in fighting for women&#x27;s rights. Umm Salama was a woman most gifted in judgment. She was active in the movement for women&#x27;s rights in early Islamic society too. She once asked Muhammad a very political question, &quot;Why are men mentioned in the Quran and why are we not?&quot; In a response from heaven to Muhammad, Allah declares that the two sexes are of total equality as members of the community and believers. It doesn&#x27;t matter the sex, as long as the person is faithful and has the desire to obey Allah, they will earn his grace. This act by Umm Salama sets the precedent, and shows that women could go directly to Muhammad when unsatisfied with a gender role associated with them in society. This action by Umm Salama represented a veritable protest movement by the women. Umm Salama possessed very good judgment, rapid powers of reasoning, and unparalleled ability to formulate correct opinions.

===Treaty of Hudaybiyya===
Umm Salama acted as Muhammad&#x27;s advisor during negotiations concerning the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah with the Meccans in 628 CE (6 AH) One of the main objects of this treaty was to determine the relations between Muhammad and the Muslims of Medina with the Quraysh in Mecca. The treaty was aimed at achieving peace between the two groups and allowing the Muslims to complete their annual pilgrimage to the Kaaba, known as Hajj, which they did the following year in 629 (7 AH). This treaty was essential since it established a 10-year peace deal between the two groups. The treaty was broken later in 629 (8 AH) which led to the conquest of Mecca.

==After Muhammad==

After Muhammad&#x27;s death, Umm Salama continued to have an influence on Islam. Her numerous Hadith transmissions have had a lasting impact on the future of the religion. Umm Salama, along with one of Muhammad&#x27;s other wives, Aisha, also took roles as imams, leading other women in worship.

Umm Salama also took a strong position in the Battle of the Camel, in which the factions of Aisha and Ali were in direct opposition. Umm Salama openly disagreed with the involvement of Aisha in the battle. She strongly supported the faction of Ali, and is said to have recalled stories in which Muhammad favors Ali and Fatimah to back up her opinions on the battle.

Umm Salama even sent her son, Umar, to fight for Ali&#x27;s victory.

Umm Salama died around 64 AH. Although the date of her death is disputed, her son said that Umm Salama died at the age of 84. She was buried in the Baqi Cemetery. She was the last surviving of Muhammad&#x27;s wives.

==Hadith==
Umm Salama and Aisha provided more Hadiths than any of the other wives of Muhammad. For Umm Salama, 378 narrations have been reported through the Sunni Muslims. Among the [Hadith] she narrated are:

===Verse of purification 33:33===

&quot;And stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like that of the former Times of Ignorance; and establish regular Prayer, and give regular Charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless.&quot;

The verse of purification (Ayat al-Tathir) verse is given its name due to the mentioning of purity in the last line. According to Umm Salama, the verse of purification was revealed in her home when only Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, and Husayn were present. Scholars such as Tarbasi and Tha&#x27;labi have described Umm Salama narrating: &quot;One day Lady Fatima having cooked some food brought it to my house for the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#x27;O the light of my eyes, call Ali and your sons so that we may eat this food together.&#x27;&quot; When all had gathered and they had eaten from that food, Angel Jibra&#x27;eel descended and revealed the following verse: &quot;Indeed God desires to repel all impurity from you, O People of the Household, and purify you with a thorough purification.&quot;

Upon hearing the verse, the Prophet laid out a cloak over them and said: &quot;O God, these are the people of my household. They are my confidants and my supporters. O God, remove impurity from them and keep them thoroughly pure.&quot; Umm Salama relates, &quot;As I heard this prayer from the Prophet, I said: &#x27;O Messenger of God! Am I also with you?&#x27; To which he replied: &#x27;You do not have the level of my Ahlul Bayt, but you are a lady of noble traits.&#x27;

Some exegesis, including Amina Wadud interpret the first line, &quot;stay quietly in your houses, and make not a dazzling display, like that of the former Times of Ignorance&quot; not to imply women shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to go out at all, but rather to stress the limitation of going out for the aim of wanton display.

===33:35===

&quot;For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in Charity, for men and women who fast (and deny themselves), for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah&#x27;s praise, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.&quot;

Umm Salama sought out equality and autonomy for Muslim women and never hesitated to posit political questions to Muhammad. This verse initiated when Umm Salama asked Muhammad, &quot;why are men mentioned in the Koran and why are we not?&quot; She is quoted narrating, &quot;I had asked the Prophet why the Koran did not speak of us as it did of men. And what was my surprise one afternoon, when I was combing my hair, to hear his voice from the minbar. I hastily did up my hair and ran to one of the apartments from where I could hear better&quot; It is there that Umm Salama heard the verse.

<text>In mathematics, the kernel of a linear map, also known as the null space or nullspace, is the part of the domain which is mapped to the zero vector of the co-domain; the kernel is always a linear subspace of the domain. That is, given a linear map between two vector spaces and , the kernel of is the vector space of all elements of such that , where denotes the zero vector in , or more symbolically:
formula_1

==Properties==

The kernel of is a linear subspace of the domain .
In the linear map formula_2 two elements of have the same image in if and only if their difference lies in the kernel of , that is,
formula_3

From this, it follows by the first isomorphism theorem that the image of is isomorphic to the quotient of by the kernel:
formula_4
In the case where is finite-dimensional, this implies the rank–nullity theorem:
formula_5
where the term refers to the dimension of the image of , formula_6 while &quot;&quot; refers to the dimension of the kernel of , formula_7 
That is,
formula_8
so that the rank–nullity theorem can be restated as 
formula_9

When is an inner product space, the quotient formula_10 can be identified with the orthogonal complement in of formula_11. This is the generalization to linear operators of the row space, or coimage, of a matrix.

==Generalization to modules==
The notion of kernel also makes sense for homomorphisms of modules, which are generalizations of vector spaces where the scalars are elements of a ring, rather than a field. The domain of the mapping is a module, with the kernel constituting a submodule. Here, the concepts of rank and nullity do not necessarily apply.

==In functional analysis==
If and are topological vector spaces such that is finite-dimensional, then a linear operator is continuous if and only if the kernel of is a closed subspace of .

==Representation as matrix multiplication==
Consider a linear map represented as a matrix with coefficients in a field (typically formula_12 or formula_13), that is operating on column vectors with components over .
The kernel of this linear map is the set of solutions to the equation , where is understood as the zero vector. The dimension of the kernel of &quot;A&quot; is called the nullity of &quot;A&quot;. In set-builder notation,
formula_14
The matrix equation is equivalent to a homogeneous system of linear equations:
formula_15
Thus the kernel of &quot;A&quot; is the same as the solution set to the above homogeneous equations.

===Subspace properties===
The kernel of a matrix over a field is a linear subspace of . That is, the kernel of , the set , has the following three properties:
# always contains the zero vector, since .
# If and , then . This follows from the distributivity of matrix multiplication over addition.
# If and is a scalar , then , since .

===The row space of a matrix===

The product &quot;A&quot;x can be written in terms of the dot product of vectors as follows:
formula_16

Here, denote the rows of the matrix . It follows that is in the kernel of , if and only if is orthogonal (or perpendicular) to each of the row vectors of (since orthogonality is defined as having a dot product of 0).

The row space, or coimage, of a matrix is the span of the row vectors of . By the above reasoning, the kernel of is the orthogonal complement to the row space. That is, a vector lies in the kernel of , if and only if it is perpendicular to every vector in the row space of .

The dimension of the row space of is called the rank of &quot;A&quot;, and the dimension of the kernel of is called the nullity of . These quantities are related by the rank–nullity theorem
formula_17

===Left null space===
The left null space, or cokernel, of a matrix consists of all column vectors such that , where T denotes the transpose of a matrix. The left null space of is the same as the kernel of . The left null space of is the orthogonal complement to the column space of , and is dual to the cokernel of the associated linear transformation. The kernel, the row space, the column space, and the left null space of are the four fundamental subspaces associated with the matrix .

===Nonhomogeneous systems of linear equations===
The kernel also plays a role in the solution to a nonhomogeneous system of linear equations:
formula_18
If and are two possible solutions to the above equation, then
formula_19
Thus, the difference of any two solutions to the equation lies in the kernel of .

It follows that any solution to the equation can be expressed as the sum of a fixed solution and an arbitrary element of the kernel. That is, the solution set to the equation is
formula_20
Geometrically, this says that the solution set to is the translation of the kernel of by the vector . See also Fredholm alternative and flat (geometry).

==Illustration==
The following is a simple illustration of the computation of the kernel of a matrix (see , below for methods better suited to more complex calculations). The illustration also touches on the row space and its relation to the kernel.

Consider the matrix
formula_21
The kernel of this matrix consists of all vectors for which
formula_22
which can be expressed as a homogeneous system of linear equations involving , , and :
formula_23

The same linear equations can also be written in matrix form as:
formula_24

Through Gauss–Jordan elimination, the matrix can be reduced to:
formula_25

Rewriting the matrix in equation form yields:
formula_26

The elements of the kernel can be further expressed in parametric vector form, as follows:
formula_27

Since is a free variable ranging over all real numbers, this can be expressed equally well as:
formula_28
The kernel of is precisely the solution set to these equations (in this case, a line through the origin in ). Here, the vector constitutes a basis of the kernel of . The nullity of is therefore 1, as it is spanned by a single vector.

The following dot products are zero:
formula_29
which illustrates that vectors in the kernel of are orthogonal to each of the row vectors of .

These two (linearly independent) row vectors span the row space of —a plane orthogonal to the vector .

With the rank 2 of , the nullity 1 of , and the dimension 3 of , we have an illustration of the rank-nullity theorem.

==Examples==

*If , then the kernel of is the solution set to a homogeneous system of linear equations. As in the above illustration, if is the operator: formula_30 then the kernel of is the set of solutions to the equations formula_31
*Let denote the vector space of all continuous real-valued functions on the interval [0,1], and define by the rule formula_32 Then the kernel of consists of all functions for which .
*Let be the vector space of all infinitely differentiable functions , and let be the differentiation operator: formula_33 Then the kernel of consists of all functions in whose derivatives are zero, i.e. the set of all constant functions.
*Let be the direct product of infinitely many copies of , and let be the shift operator formula_34 Then the kernel of is the one-dimensional subspace consisting of all vectors .
*If is an inner product space and is a subspace, the kernel of the orthogonal projection is the orthogonal complement to in .

==Computation by Gaussian elimination==
A basis of the kernel of a matrix may be computed by Gaussian elimination.

For this purpose, given an matrix , we construct first the row augmented matrix formula_35 where is the identity matrix.

Computing its column echelon form by Gaussian elimination (or any other suitable method), we get a matrix formula_36 A basis of the kernel of consists in the non-zero columns of such that the corresponding column of is a zero column.

In fact, the computation may be stopped as soon as the upper matrix is in column echelon form: the remainder of the computation consists in changing the basis of the vector space generated by the columns whose upper part is zero.

For example, suppose that
formula_37
Then
formula_38

Putting the upper part in column echelon form by column operations on the whole matrix gives
formula_39

The last three columns of are zero columns. Therefore, the three last vectors of ,
formula_40
are a basis of the kernel of .

Proof that the method computes the kernel: Since column operations correspond to post-multiplication by invertible matrices, the fact that formula_41 reduces to formula_42 means that there exists an invertible matrix formula_43 such that formula_44 with formula_45 in column echelon form. Thus and A column vector formula_46 belongs to the kernel of formula_47 (that is formula_48) if and only if formula_49 where As formula_45 is in column echelon form, if and only if the nonzero entries of formula_51 correspond to the zero columns of By multiplying by one may deduce that this is the case if and only if formula_52 is a linear combination of the corresponding columns of 

==Numerical computation==
The problem of computing the kernel on a computer depends on the nature of the coefficients.

===Exact coefficients===
If the coefficients of the matrix are exactly given numbers, the column echelon form of the matrix may be computed with Bareiss algorithm more efficiently than with Gaussian elimination. It is even more efficient to use modular arithmetic and Chinese remainder theorem, which reduces the problem to several similar ones over finite fields (this avoids the overhead induced by the non-linearity of the computational complexity of integer multiplication).

For coefficients in a finite field, Gaussian elimination works well, but for the large matrices that occur in cryptography and Gröbner basis computation, better algorithms are known, which have roughly the same computational complexity, but are faster and behave better with modern computer hardware.

===Floating point computation===
For matrices whose entries are floating-point numbers, the problem of computing the kernel makes sense only for matrices such that the number of rows is equal to their rank: because of the rounding errors, a floating-point matrix has almost always a full rank, even when it is an approximation of a matrix of a much smaller rank. Even for a full-rank matrix, it is possible to compute its kernel only if it is well conditioned, i.e. it has a low condition number.

Even for a well conditioned full rank matrix, Gaussian elimination does not behave correctly: it introduces rounding errors that are too large for getting a significant result. As the computation of the kernel of a matrix is a special instance of solving a homogeneous system of linear equations, the kernel may be computed with any of the various algorithms designed to solve homogeneous systems. A state of the art software for this purpose is the Lapack library.

<doc id="1072917" wikidata="Q5020843" url="?curid=1072917" title="2004 California Proposition 62">
<text>Proposition 62 was a California ballot proposition on the November 2, 2004 ballot. It failed to pass with 5,119,155 (46.1%) votes in favor and 5,968,770 (53.9%) against.

Officially known as the Voter Choice Open Primary Act, the proposition was an initiative constitutional amendment and statute that provided for a modified blanket primary (two-round) election system like that used in the state of Louisiana.

Under the provisions of the proposition, instead of traditional partisan primary elections for statewide offices (in which voters have to be registered with a political party to choose the nominee of that party in the primary), all candidates for election would appear on the primary election ballot (first round ballot), and all voters could vote for any candidate regardless of the party affiliation of the voter or candidates. The two candidates with the most votes (regardless of party or lack thereof) would later appear on the general election (second round) ballot.

Prop 62 would have affected elections to all statewide elected officers (Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Insurance Commissioner, Controller, Secretary of State, and Treasurer), for the California State Legislature, and for federal congressional elections (to both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The proposition did exempt presidential primary elections and elections of party central committees.

The provisions of Proposition 62 conflicted with those of Proposition 60, which the California State Legislature referred on the ballot. That proposition essentially re-affirmed the existing partisan primary system. The California Constitution provides that if the provisions of two approved propositions are in conflict, only the provisions of the measure with the higher number of &quot;yes&quot; votes at the statewide election take effect. Since Prop 60 passed and Prop 62 did not, the issue was moot.
==Official summary==
* Requires primary elections where all voters may vote for any state or federal candidate regardless of how a voter or candidate is registered.
* Exempts presidential nominations and elections of party-central committees.
* Only the two primary election candidates receiving most votes for an office, whether they are candidates with &quot;no party&quot; or members of same or different party, would be listed on general election ballot.
* In special primary election, candidate receiving majority vote is elected.
* Requires political party&#x27;s consent for identification of candidates&#x27; party registration on ballot and in other official election publications.

Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:
* No significant net fiscal effect on state and local governments.

<text>Richard Westwood Worth (3 July 1948 – 10 May 2022) was a New Zealand politician of the New Zealand National Party. He was the Member of Parliament for Epsom from 1999 to 2005 and a list MP from 2005 to 2009.

Prior to entering Parliament, Worth studied law and business administration, and had a career in law and management. such as being the executive chair of the law firm Simpson Grierson. Worth joined the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserves, rising to captain, and had the role of Chief of Naval Reserves for four years. He worked as consul to Columbia and honorary consul to Monaco.

Worth entered Parliament in 2005, after winning the Epsom electorate. He was in opposition from 2005 to 2008 and in government from 2008 until 2009. His roles in government included Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister for Land Information, and Associate Minister of Justice. He opposed the Civil Union Act 2004, which granted recognition of same-sex couples, proposed the creation of a National Day to replace Waitangi Day, and put forward a private members bill to address miscarriages of justice. As Minister for Land Information, Worth introduced the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Bill in 2008 that sought to correct historic errors relating to land status.

Worth resigned from Parliament in June 2009. Party leader John Key said that Worth&#x27;s conduct &quot;[did] not befit a minister and I will not have him in my Cabinet&quot;, and said if he had not resigned he would have removed him from his Cabinet positions. While allegations about him were made public and police investigated, Worth was not charged. It was never publicly announced what caused Key to lose confidence in Worth and require his resignation. His roles after leaving Parliament included returning to the role of honorary consul to Monaco.

Worth was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (military division) in the 1994 New Year Honours for his work in the Naval Volunteer Reserves.

==Early life and career==
Born in Auckland, Worth obtained an LLB (Hons) and Master of Jurisprudence (First Class) from the University of Auckland and a Master of Business Administration (Distinction) from Massey University. He obtained a PhD from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) with a thesis entitled &quot;The Closer Economic Relationship Between Australia and New Zealand: choices other than quiescence or withdrawal in the face of conflict?&quot;, which he completed in 2004.

Worth had a career in law and management, including being the executive chairperson of Simpson Grierson, one of New Zealand&#x27;s larger law firms, from 1986 to 1999. He was the consul for Colombia for six years, and later, the honorary consul for Monaco for eight. He was also a director of Prada America&#x27;s Cup (NZ) Limited, but would later quit after suggestions it was disloyal for an MP to be linked to a syndicate challenging the New Zealand team.

Worth joined the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserves in 1968, rising to captain, and had the role of Chief of Naval Reserves from July 1990 to July 1994. Worth was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (military division) in the 1994 New Year Honours for his work in the Naval Volunteer Reserves. Worth has also been involved in the Order of St John who, in 2008, made him a Knight of the Order of St John.

Worth was married and had one daughter.

==Member of Parliament==



=== Electoral history and roles ===
Worth entered Parliament when he successfully stood as the National Party&#x27;s candidate for the Auckland electorate of Epsom in the 1999 election, winning with a majority of 1,908. National did not win the election overall and so Worth became an Opposition MP. He was re-elected in the 2002 election with an increased majority of 5,619. In his first six years in Parliament, Worth served on the Regulations Review committee and Law and Order committee, and had appointments as the National Party spokesperson for defence, veterans&#x27; affairs and justice.

Worth lost his electorate seat in the 2005 election to the ACT New Zealand leader Rodney Hide. Hide had put out a tactical voting message calling on National voters to support him in order to elect a coalition partner for National; without winning Epsom, ACT was unlikely to win another electorate seat or to get five percent of the party vote, so would not enter Parliament. National and Worth continued to fight for the seat, but Worth lost by more than 3,000 votes. Worth was however elected as a list MP, and National&#x27;s party vote in Epsom was the highest of any electorate in the country in that election. When John Key became National Party leader in November 2006, Worth was reassigned to the economic development portfolio.

At the 2008 election, Worth lost Epsom again, this time by nearly 13,000 votes, but was re-elected on the party list. National&#x27;s highest party vote was again in Epsom. National also won the election overall. Worth became Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister for Land Information, Minister Responsible for Archives New Zealand, Minister Responsible for the National Library and Associate Minister of Justice. Worth was reportedly a contender for Speaker of the House, with the support of the previous speaker Jonathan Hunt, but Lockwood Smith was selected instead.

===Policies and actions===
Worth&#x27;s maiden speech in February 2000 focused on trade, economics and Asia.

In 2002 he faced questions from his party for sightseeing in Cairo instead of attending a Maori Battalion service during an official trip to Egypt.

In 2005 he proposed the creation of a National Day to replace Waitangi Day. He proposed 24 May, the day that the New Zealand colony was granted a representative constitution by the British Parliament.

Worth was a member of the Select Committee hearing submissions about the Civil Union Bill. He was a strong opponent of the bill, which allowed legal recognition of same-sex couples though a second class of relationships besides marriage. Worth was concerned that civil unions were in effect marriages, and he described the government as &quot;anti-family&quot; and said that &quot;marriage is a valuable institution in civil society and it is important that its value is not degraded or diminished by Act of Parliament.&quot; Worth said that civil unions would discriminate against non-sexual relationships, and proposed an amendment to the bill which would allow any two people, including family members and friends, to register a civil relationship that established certain rights such as right to visit in hospital or make medical decisions. Worth reported that this amendment had about one-third of the votes in the Committee stage and was not included into the bill. Ultimately the bill was passed and became the Civil Union Act 2004.

In 2007 Worth proposed a private members bill to address miscarriages of justice. However, the Ministry of Justice recommended to the Labour Government that they not adopt it. The Deputy Prime Minister of the time, Michael Cullen, wrote to Worth about his bill saying it was too broad and might have unwarranted constitutional and fiscal consequences, that the Government would not support it.

As Minister for Land Information, Worth introduced the Reserves and Other Lands Disposal Bill in 2008. This bill sought to correct historic oversights, errors or omissions relating to land status. It consisted of a number of specific reclassifications of land. The bill was ultimately enacted in 2015, after Worth had left Parliament.

In March 2009 he was reprimanded by his leader John Key for failing to mention that he was connected to a company that stood to gain from official visit to India. During the trip Worth both spoke on behalf of the Government and also arranged personal business deals. Worth did not consider there to be any conflict of interest. He later disengaged from his Indian business interests and stepped down as chair of the New Zealand India Trade Group.

===Resignation===
On 3 June 2009 Prime Minister John Key issued a press release announcing Richard Worth had resigned as a Minister. The press release stated that Worth had &quot;advised me of some private matters in respect of which he felt it appropriate that he should resign as a Minister&quot;, and that Key would make no further comment about these matters.

The same day, the New Zealand Police issued a statement saying an allegation had been made against a sitting MP and that they were beginning a preliminary investigation. Key confirmed that Worth was the subject of a police investigation. Key would not say if the matter reported to police was the reason for the resignation, saying instead that Worth&#x27;s conduct &quot;[did] not befit a minister and I will not have him in my Cabinet,&quot; and had Worth not resigned he would have been sacked. The woman who laid the police complaint was never identified, with it only being revealed that she was a Korean businesswoman.

Key also stated that some weeks prior he had received a separate allegation that Richard Worth had &quot;[made] a nuisance of himself towards women&quot;, which Key investigated and had received assurances that those allegations were not correct. This other accusation was presented to Key by then-leader of the Opposition, Phil Goff. The woman behind this allegation was revealed to be Neelam Choudary, an active member of the New Zealand Labour Party. According to Choudary, Worth first contacted her on 26 November 2008, and altogether, forty texts and sixty telephone calls ensued, continuing until 23 February 2009. Choudary, an ethnic Indian, alleged that she was offered a job as an ethnic affairs advisor or board member in return for romantic favours. She also alleged that inappropriate and vulgar telephone calls included asking her to buy transparent garments, and that his conduct was unacceptable and unwanted. Neelam Choudary herself faced scrutiny when it was later revealed that her husband, Kumar Akkineni Choudary, had been convicted the year before for his role in an immigration scam.

Worth declared that he was innocent of any crime. Prime Minister Key reiterated that there was no future for Worth within his Cabinet, and warned that suspension or expulsion from the National caucus was still a prospect. Worth resigned from Parliament on 12 June 2009 (effective 16 June 2009), citing that his role as a Member of Parliament was compromised due to &quot;the avalanche of rumour and innuendo,&quot; and he wished to seek a new direction in international trade. After Worth&#x27;s parliamentary resignation, Cam Calder took his place as the next eligible person on the current New Zealand National Party list.

In early July 2009 it was reported that the woman who made the original allegation to police had withdrawn her complaint and police dropped the matter. In November 2009, police announced that Worth would not face charges. As of July 2009, Choudary had not made the text exchanges public, though she sent copies of 34 texts from Worth, and her phone logs, to Key. Labour did not pursue the matter further. It was never publicly announced what caused Key to lose confidence in Worth and require his resignation.

==Post-parliamentary career==
In October 2010, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade announced that Worth had been reappointed honorary consul to Monaco, a role he had held before entering Parliament. Monaco had appointed him to the role at least a year prior, but Foreign Minister Murray McCully sought legal advice on whether he could refuse the application and held up the appointment until approving it in October 2010. As of April 2020, Worth still held the role which has seen him attend the wedding of Prince Albert II to Charlene Wittstock.

Worth died on 10 May 2022.

<text>William Lindsay Tisch (born 9 October 1947), known as Lindsay Tisch, is a former New Zealand National Party politician.

==Early life==
Tisch was born in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1947. When he was a child, his family moved to Matamata. He obtained a diploma in agriculture from Lincoln College. He has worked as a farmer and a rural valuer, and was a management consultant. He was a director of Landcorp (1991–1997) and is a member of the Institute of Directors in New Zealand and the New Zealand Institute of Property Management.

Tisch is a Justice of the Peace, a trustee of the Pohlen Hospital Foundation based in Matamata, and a member of Matamata Lions Clubs.

==Member of Parliament==


He joined the National Party in 1966, and has held a number of senior roles in its organisational wing. In 1994 he served briefly as the party&#x27;s president and was the party&#x27;s campaign manager for the 1996 election. He was a member of Parliament from 1999 to 2017, when he retired.

Tisch was selected to replace John Luxton as National&#x27;s candidate in the electorate of in the 1999 election. He defeated the Labour candidate by 5,000 votes. The name of the electorate was changed back to for the 2002 election and the 2005 election; Tisch was comfortably re-elected each time. The name referred to a little-known river past Morrinsville, and Tisch was successful in lobbying to have the electorate renamed after the Waikato River.

In the 2008 election, Tisch was re-elected in the recreated Waikato seat with a majority of 12,850 over Jacinda Ardern. He was further re-elected in the 2011 election and 2014 election, after which he retired.

In 2009, it was revealed Tisch was using a front company to maximise his accommodation allowance paid by the taxpayer. Tisch was claiming $410 a week which was paid to his property investment company, Heritage 653 Limited.

Tisch was never a minister but held senior parliamentary roles in the National Party and in the House of Representatives. He was the National Party junior whip (2002–2005) and senior whip (2005–2006) before taking on roles as Deputy Speaker of the House (2008–2011) and Assistant Speaker of the House (2011–2017). Under former leaders Bill English and Don Brash, Tisch was briefly National Party spokesperson for small business (2002–2005), civil defence and emergency services (2003–2004), and internal affairs (2003–2005).

=== Political views ===
Tisch held conservative views and opposed same-sex marriage law reform. In 2004, Tisch voted against the Civil Union Act 2004, a bill making it legal for those in same-sex as well as heterosexual relationships to enter into a civil-union. In 2005, Tisch voted for Gordon Copeland&#x27;s Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, a bill which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and woman. In 2012 and 2013, Tisch voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand.

==Honours==
Tisch was one of the 3,632 recipients of the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, which he received for services to the public.

In the 2018 New Year Honours, Tisch was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for services as a Member of Parliament. In the 2020 New Year Honours, his wife, Leonie, was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Service Medal, for services to health and the community.

<text>The American National Election Studies (ANES) are academically-run national surveys of voters in the United States, conducted before and after every presidential election. Although it was formally established by a National Science Foundation grant in 1977, the data are a continuation of studies going back to 1948. The study has been based at the University of Michigan since its origin and, since 2005, has been run in partnership with Stanford University. Its principal investigators for the first four years of the partnership were Arthur Lupia and Jon Krosnick. As of 2017, the principal investigators are Ted Brader and Vincent Hutchings of the University of Michigan and Shanto Iyengar of Stanford University.

The studies ask the same questions repeatedly over time and are frequently cited in works of political science. Early ANES data was the basis for &quot;The American Voter&quot; (1960). It is now used by scholars, students and journalists. It has allowed the detection of partisan bias in survey responses, showing that respondents&#x27; political affiliations contribute to their responses, extending even to questions with objective, known answers, such as whether or not Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

In 2006, ANES opened the ANES Online Commons to allow interested scholars and survey professionals to propose questions for future surveys. In 2022, ANES received a $14 million grant to study the 2024 United States elections. University of Michigan professor Nicholas Valentino, Stanford University&#x27;s Shanto Iyengar, Duke University&#x27;s D. Sunshine Hillygus, and the University of Texas&#x27; Daron Shaw will be principal investigators.

<doc id="1072937" wikidata="Q3046650" url="?curid=1072937" title="Eaton Hall, Cheshire">
<text>Eaton Hall is the country house of the Duke of Westminster. It is south of the village of Eccleston in Cheshire, England. The house is surrounded by its own formal gardens, parkland, farmland and woodland. The estate covers about .

The first substantial house on the site was built in the 17th century. During the early 19th century it was replaced by a much larger house designed by William Porden. This in turn was replaced by an even larger house, with outbuildings and a chapel, designed by Alfred Waterhouse. Its construction started in 1870 and concluded about 12 years later. By 1960 the fabric of the house had deteriorated and, like many other mansions during this period, it was demolished, although the chapel and many of the outbuildings were retained. A new house was built but its design was not considered to be sympathetic to the local landscape, and in the late 1980s it was re-cased and given the appearance of a French château.

The house has been surrounded by formal gardens since the 17th century, the design of which has changed over the centuries in accordance with contemporary ideas and fashions, as has the surrounding parkland. A variety of buildings are included in the estate, some decorative, others built for the business of the estate; many of these are listed buildings. The house and estate are not normally open to the public, but the gardens are open on three days a year to raise money for charity, and some of the estate&#x27;s buildings can be hired for charitable purposes.

==Halls==

Eaton Hall has been the country house of the Grosvenor family since the 15th century. There is evidence of a two-storey house on a moated site in the estate in a 17th century estate map and an 18th century engraving. A survey undertaken in 1798 showed that the building was still present.

===Samwell Hall===


The first substantial house was built for Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet. He inherited the estate at the age of 8 when he succeeded his grandfather, Sir Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Baronet, who died in 1665. The new owner commissioned the architect William Samwell to design the house. Building started in 1675; much of the stone used was brought from the ruined Holt Castle in north Wales. By 1683 the cost of building the house had risen to over £1,000 (). An engraving of the time shows it to have been a substantial square house with three storeys and dormers. The entrance front had nine bays and a portico. The engraving also shows the earlier moated house to the south of the new house.

===Porden Hall===

By the time that Robert Grosvenor, then the 2nd Earl Grosvenor, and later the 1st Marquess of Westminster, inherited the estate in 1802, the Samwell Hall had become old-fashioned and in need of renovation. Grosvenor appointed William Porden to plan the improvements. Building started in 1803 and Porden (later assisted by Porden&#x27;s son-in-law Joseph Kay) estimated it would take three years to build at a cost of £10,000 (). In the event it took just under 10 years and cost over £100,000 (). The previous house was encased and surrounded by &quot;every possible permutation of the gothic style&quot;; including turrets, pinnacles, arched windows, octagonal towers, and buttresses (both regular and flying). Two new wings were added in the first stage, and in the 1820s more wings were added, by this time under the direction of Benjamin Gummow. The interior of the house was as lavish as the exterior, with more Gothic detailing. The hangings for the state bed included of purple damask and of sarsenet (fine silk) trimmed with gold lace. When the future Queen Victoria visited in 1832 at the age of 13, she wrote in her journal: &quot;The house is magnificent&quot;. Others described it as being &quot;as extravagant and opulent as the very latest upholsterer-decorators could make it&quot;. A critic found it &quot;the most gaudy concern I ever saw&quot; and &quot;a vast pile of mongrel gothic which ... is a monument of wealth, ignorance and bad taste&quot;. Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, succeeded his father in 1845 and commissioned the Scottish architect William Burn to make alterations to the house. Burn raised the centre of the south front to make it look like a tower, and changed some of the external Gothic features. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described this house as a &quot;spectacular Gothic mansion&quot;.

===Waterhouse Hall===

The 2nd Marquess died in 1869 and was succeeded by his son Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, initially the 3rd Marquess and from 1874 the 1st Duke of Westminster. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse to design another new hall. Again the core of the previous hall was retained; parts were refaced and re-modelled, other parts were completely rebuilt. A private wing was built for the use of the family, and this was joined to the main part of the hall by a corridor. Waterhouse also designed the chapel and a clock-house, and rebuilt most of the stabling. The work began in 1870, took 12 years to complete, and cost £803,000 (). The library was long, the dining room with its ante room was long, and the octagonal great hall contained an organ. For the interior, Henry Stacy Marks painted a frieze of the Canterbury Pilgrims for the morning room, Gertrude Jekyll painted panels for the drawing room, and in other rooms were paintings by Gainsborough, Stubbs and Reynolds. Pevsner wrote that it &quot;was an outstanding expression of High Victorian originality&quot;, and added &quot;this Wagnerian palace was the most ambitious instance of Gothic Revival domestic architecture anywhere in the country&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;one of the most princely and beautiful mansions that these islands contain&quot;.

In 1902 the 2nd Duke gave the large alabaster, porphyry and green serpentine chimneypiece from the Ante-Drawing Room as a wedding present to his sister Lettice, Countess Beauchamp. In 1910 it was carefully dismantled and re-erected at her house, Madresfield Court, Malvern, by the architect Randall Wells, to become the focus of his new top-lit Staircase Hall, where it survives. 

During both World Wars, parts of the hall were used as a hospital. In 1943, the Britannia Royal Naval College moved to the hall from Dartmouth when the college there was bombed. It moved back to Dartmouth in 1946, after which the hall was used as an officer cadet training unit until the end of National Service in 1958.

===Dennys Hall and the present hall===

By 1960 the hall needed repair and decoration, and dry rot was found in the roof. In 1963 Gerald Grosvenor, 4th Duke of Westminster, decided to demolish the main part of the Waterhouse building and the private wing whilst retaining the chapel, clock tower and stables. A new building was commissioned by the Duke, who appointed John Dennys, his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law, as architect. Dennys had earlier worked on Saighton Grange on the Eaton estate.

The intention was to build a modern, manageable home. The result was a rectangular, flat-roofed building, faced with white Travertine, its &quot;whiteness [being] a stark contrast to the softness of the Cheshire landscape&quot;. Its construction began in 1971, it took less than  years to build, and cost £459,000 (). The exterior had a central porte-cochère on the entrance front. The house followed an asymmetrical plan, with two storeys plus a basement containing a swimming pool. A central two-storey hall gave access to the principal rooms, with the main reception rooms being on the first floor. The decor included wall coverings in silk and woodblock floors.

Subsequently, the Dennys Hall was considered to be unsympathetic to its setting, and it was decided to change its exterior. This was undertaken by the Percy Thomas Partnership. Work on recasing the Dennys Hall to make it look more like a French château began in 1989 and was completed in 1991. The result has not been widely praised; the 2011 Cheshire Pevsner describes the building as &quot;Château style, (Waterhouse&#x27;s) Eaton style, but also Tesco style&quot;.

===Associated structures===

Adjacent to the hall are the remaining structures designed by Waterhouse. To the north is Eaton Chapel; this, with its clock tower, is a Grade I listed building. The decorative scheme of the interior of the chapel is based on the &#x27;Te Deum&#x27;; it involves stained glass and stone mosaic, and was developed by Frederic Shields. Immediately to the north of the chapel is the Stable Court; this is listed at Grade II*. The buildings in the Stable Court are in brick, red stone, and half-timbering, with red tile roofs. The west range has a half-timbered upper storey with two gables, and a central gatehouse with turrets which are polygonal at the base and circular higher up and have conical roofs. On each side of the gatehouse are two-storey arcades with gables above. In the courtyard is a statue of a horse by Joseph Boehm, which is listed at Grade II. At the southeast corner of the stable yard is a postillion&#x27;s house, dated 1873 and listed at Grade II*. In a lobby between the stable yard and the chapel is an artificial grotto, listed at Grade II. In the area around the Stable Court are further structures listed at Grade II. To the north is the Coachhouse Court, which consists of a coach-house, a covered court and a riding school. These were designed in the 1870s for the 1st Duke. To the north of this are Eaton Hall Cottages, four attached cottages, which were designed about the same time. In the forecourt between the Coachhouse Court and the cottages is a lodge, with gates, piers and screens. Near to the cottages is the former engine shed of the Eaton Hall Railway. To the east of the stable yard is a chapel-like sandstone game pantry dating from the 1870s.

From 1896 until 1947, the estate was served by the gauge Eaton Hall Railway. The line ran from the hall to a depot at Balderton on the Chester-Wrexham line, and a spur went to Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest, where there was a repair yard. Part of the old railway route was re-opened in 1996.

==Grounds==

The estate covers an area of about , within which about of parkland and about of formal gardens. These are listed at Grade II* on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The boundaries of the estate generally follow field boundaries but on the east side they follow the line of the River Dee.

===History===

In the 17th century, formal gardens were created around the Samwell Hall; these included such features as parterres and canals. However they were costly to maintain, and in the later part of the 18th century fashions changed to favour a more informal type of garden layout. Credit for designing the informal gardens at Eaton Hall has been given to Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. Although one of Brown&#x27;s documents dated 1764 shows that payment was made to him by the estate, it also notes that a plan for the garden had been drawn up by William Emes. From this, Marion Mako concludes that, as Brown was an engineer as well as a landscape gardener, the payment was for an engineering project rather than for landscaping. Emes had been influenced by Brown, although he had not been his pupil. With his clerk of works, Thomas Leggett, Emes worked in the estate for the next 10 years. When Robert Grosvenor (later the 1st Marquess) inherited the estate at the beginning of the 19th century, it had become run-down. The marquess appointed John Webb, a pupil of Emes, to improve the garden and the landscaping. Among Webb&#x27;s innovations were new terrace walls behind the house, the levelling of Belgrave Avenue and the planting of 130,000 trees along it, and a serpentine lake to the east of the house alongside the River Dee. He also arranged for the construction of greenhouses and a kitchen garden. 

Fashions changed again, and in the 1820s William Andrews Nesfield was employed to design new parterres. He also built more terracing and a balustraded wall. Statues, stone urns and vases on pedestals were added to the garden. In 1852 the Camellia House was built; this was extended in 1870 to its final size of long, wide, and high. The present kitchen garden was created the same year; this provided the food not only for the hall, but also for Grosvenor House in London. More greenhouses were built and, by about 1880, 56 gardeners were employed. There were other building works in the grounds. Waterhouse created a grotto between the chapel and the stable yard, and designed the Parrot House and a loggia (now known as the Temple). The Chester architect John Douglas designed the Dutch Tea House in the Tea Garden, and a number of service buildings in the estate. In 1897–98 Edwin Lutyens started to improve what had been known as the Italian Garden (and is now the Dragon Garden).

Work continued in the gardens and grounds during the 20th century. The 2nd Duke commissioned Detmar Blow, a pupil of Lutyens, to re-design parts of the gardens. With Fernand Billerey, he removed the parterres, built a canal leading away from the house, added hedged compartments to the terraces, and a pond at the base of the terraces (now the Lioness and Kudu Pond). During the Second World War, part of the parkland was requisitioned as an airfield, and in 1940 some of the garden buildings were damaged by a cluster of incendiary devices. After the war, improvement of the gardens did not resume until the 1960s, when the wives of the 4th and 5th Dukes worked with the designer James Russell. Since the early 1990s, the gardens have been further developed under the 6th Duke and his wife, Natalia, working with the garden designers Arabella Lennox-Boyd and Vernon Russell Smith.

===Formal gardens===

To the east of the house a series of terraces leads down to the Fish Pond. The retaining walls at the southern end of the upper terrace are listed at Grade II, as are the retaining walls at the end of the upper terrace and the steps leading down to the middle terrace. Stretching along the middle terrace is a long rectangular pool containing a three fountains. The retaining walls of this pool are listed at Grade II, as are the railings on the north and the south side of the terrace. On each side of the pool are two compartments framed by yew hedges. Between these compartments, on each side, is a statue by Raymond Smith. Both of these were made in 1852 for the 2nd Marquess and are listed at Grade II. The one to the north depicts a stag at bay, and that to the south a hunter on a rearing horse.

From the end of the pool, steps lead down to a smaller rectangular pool at right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining wall at the end of the terrace are listed at Grade II. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at Grade II. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rd Marquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at Grade II. At the south end of the Broad Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at Grade II. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at Grade II.

South of the loggia is the Dutch Tea Garden, which was laid out by C. E. Mallows in about 1905. The garden contains the Tea House which was designed by John Douglas. This has a cruciform plan and is a half-timbered building on a sandstone plinth. The roof is of red tiles, and sweeps upwards to a small spire surmounted by a weathercock. It is listed at Grade II. In the centre of the garden is a statue of Mercury and in front of the Tea House are two stone Talbots. To the north of the Tea House, on the path leading to the Broad Walk, is a pair of wrought iron gates made in 1913 for the 2nd Duke. The gates and their overthrow are listed at Grade II.

To the south of the hall is a formal garden known as the Italian Garden. This contains a pool at the centre of which is the Dragon Fountain. The fountain is listed at Grade II. In the Italian Garden are two statues, also listed at Grade II, which were taken from the old hall when it was demolished; these are a statue of Joan of Eaton, and of the Norman Bishop Odo.

Leading from the north of the house is the Spring Walk, leading to the Kitchen Garden, in which food is grown for the family. To the east of the Kitchen Garden is the Camellia Walk, a long greenhouse filled with camellias. This is long and is believed to be the longest glass corridor in the world. It is listed at Grade II. Some of the gates in this garden are believed to have been designed by Lutyens, and are listed at Grade II. Other walls and gates around the garden were designed by Waterhouse in about 1870, and are listed at Grade II*.

To the east of the house is the forecourt, which has as its centrepiece a pool containing an equestrian statue of the 1st Duke. This depicts the Duke on horseback holding aloft a falcon. It is in bronze and was made between 1870 and 1879 for the Duke by G. F. Watts. It is listed at Grade II*. The retaining walls of the pond are listed at Grade II. To the west of the forecourt are the Golden Gates which, together with their screens and lodges, are listed at Grade I. The other listed building in the gardens is a large stone urn on the east side of the Fish Pool dating from about 1880. This is richly carved, is high, and stands on a circular pedestal which forms the final feature of the eastern view from the hall. It is listed at Grade II.

===Other features===

The grounds can be entered by a number of approaches, each of which contain structures of architectural importance. Belgrave Avenue, some long, is a straight drive which leads from the Wrexham Road (B5445) to the Golden Gates and the forecourt on the east of the hall. Belgrave Lodge, on the south side of the avenue was built in 1899 to a design by John Douglas for the 1st Duke. It is built in red bricks with yellow stone plinths, bands and other dressings and is listed at Grade II. The associated lodge gates, piers and wing walls were designed at the same time by Douglas and are also listed at Grade II. Part way along the avenue, on its north side, is Upper Belgrave Lodge. This was also designed by Douglas for the 1st Duke, it is dated 1877, and is Grade II listed. Further along the avenue is a Grade II listed obelisk in red sandstone with a copper cap, dated 1890, designed by Douglas and Fordham.

The Aldford Approach leads from the village of Aldford and crosses the River Dee by the Grade I listed Aldford Iron Bridge, which was built in 1824 by William Hazledine for the 1st Marquess. Iron Bridge Lodge, adjacent to this bridge, was designed by Douglas and Fordham in 1894 and is listed at Grade II. Also on this approach is Coachmore Hill Lodge which was designed in the 1880s by Douglas; it is listed at Grade II. On the approach, near the Dutch Tea Garden are gates with an overthrow, and piers dating from about 1870 in Classic Revival style, listed at Grade II.

From the north of the hall are two further approaches. The Eccleston Approach goes to the village of Eccleston, and slightly to the west, the Chester Approach bypasses the village, going through Eccleston Hill. Associated with these approaches are further listed buildings. Of these, the major structure is Eccleston Hill Lodge which was designed in 1881–82 by Douglas for the 1st Duke and is listed at Grade II*. This is a three-storey gatehouse tower with multiple attached smaller towers and a steeply hipped roof. The other structures are listed at Grade II and comprise Eccleston Lodge which was designed by Douglas and Fordham in 1894, its associated gates, piers and wing railings, a sandstone balustered causeway south of the lodge carrying the drive, a house called Eaton Boat, designed by Douglas about 1880, Garden Lodge designed by Waterhouse in 1881–83, a pair of gates, railings and screen walls adjoining the lodge dating from 1881–83 by Waterhouse, Stud Lodge storehouse and domestic offices, designed in 1883 by Douglas, the Stud Riding School, the Stud Stables, the house east of Stud, Eaton Estate Office, designed by Waterhouse in 1880, the North Lodge of 1881 by Waterhouse, the North Lodge gate and post from about 1881 also by Waterhouse, the Garden House of 1893 by Douglas and Minshull, and gates and gate piers to the south of Garden House.

==Present day==

Eaton Hall is a private residence and is not open to the public, but the gardens are open three days each year to raise money for charity. In the area of the Stable Court are a number of rooms which are used for exhibitions. The Carriage Museum holds the Westminster Collection of Carriages. The Exhibition Room houses a collection of items relating to the Grosvenor family, and the History Room contains items about the history of the family and illustrations of the hall at various stages in the past. The Stables include items relating to the family&#x27;s horses. In the garden, the Parrot House contains an exhibition of paintings by the Victorian artist Henry Stacy Marks.

Some of the areas in the stable court are available for hire for charitable fund raising. The Long Room, which was refurbished in 1992 and now has the character of a large country house drawing room, can hold 150 people. The former saddle room is now a dining room. The carriage room and adjoining buildings have been converted into the Wolf Room, which has a movable stage and audio-visual facilities. It can seat 200 people and contains eight black-chalk pictures of birds by Joseph Wolf. The chapel is usually reserved for the family but in December each year it is used for carol concerts to raise money for charity.

<text>Pattali Makkal Katchi (; PMK) is a Vanniyar caste party in Tamil Nadu, India, founded by S. Ramadoss in 1989 for the Vanniyar caste in northern Tamil Nadu. It is a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). It contests the elections with the &quot;Ripe Mango&quot; symbol.

The PMK is noted for its involvement in riots and vandalism. A former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha, likened the party to a terrorist organisation and threatened to ban it for its frequent involvement in violence and vandalism of public property.

==History==
===Vanniyar Sangam===
S. Ramadoss founded the in 1980, bringing together a coalition of Vanniyar caste organisations. The Vanniyar Sangam is PMK&#x27;s parent organisation. The Vanniyar Sangham organised the 1987 Vanniyar reservation agitation demanding Most Backward Caste (MBC) status for Vanniyars. At the peak of the protests, the state was paralysed for a week when thousands of trees were felled, highways blocked and damaged and more than 1,400 houses of the Dalit community were burned down. The police shot 21 protestors. Later, in 1989, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government led by M. Karunanidhi granted MBC status to the Vanniyars, with the associated reservation entitlements in education and employment.

===PMK (1989–present)===
Ramadoss founded the PMK on 16 July 1989, emerging from the Vanniyar reservation protests of 1987.

Ahead of the 2004 elections, PMK joined the Democratic Progressive Alliance, a broad Tamil political coalition which also included the DMK, Indian National Congress (INC), Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Union Muslim League. The party was able to obtain a significant share of power both in the regional government in Tamil Nadu and the Central Government due to the number of seats it obtained which helped the United Progressive Alliance (UPA-I) to form the Government.

Following the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the PMK joined the United Progressive Alliance led by the INC. In June 2008, during the final months of the bitter relationship between the DMK and the PMK, the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu severed its ties with the PMK, who were outside supporters of the Karunanidhi Government. However, the DMK did not press for the party&#x27;s removal from the UPA Government at the centre. On 26 March 2009, PMK declared that, it would join the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led front and left the United Progressive Alliance (UPA).

Ramadoss and his son, Anbumani Ramdoss, were arrested by the Jayalalitha government for their inflammatory speeches, the PMK cadres indulged in violence in April 2013 causing property damages estimated worth ₹600 crores. Jayalalitha likened the party to a “terrorist” organization and claimed they hurled petrol bombs on moving vehicles and caused damages to 850 vehicles including public buses and threatened to ban the party. Ramadoss and his son were released after 12 days in prison.

PMK contested in the 2014 Lok Sabha election in an alliance with BJP-led NDA and its candidate Anbumani Ramadoss won the Dharmapuri Lok Sabha constituency, he was one of two non-AIADMK MPs from Tamil Nadu the other being from its ally BJP.

PMK continued its alliance with AIADMK and BJP in the 2019 Indian general election in Tamil Nadu and contested 7 seats but the party failed to win any seats.

PMK again contested seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, fielding 10 candidates across 10 separate constituencies. Just one candidate, A. Mani, winning the Dharmapuri Lok Sabha constituency, thus flipping the constituency back to PMK after 5 years of DMK control.

The Madras Institute of Developmental Studies (MIDS) and an reported that the PMK and the Hindu Munnani was involved in the 2019 Ponparappi violence where Dalit women were sexually abused and Dalit houses were attacked and damaged. An NGO Evidence also blamed PMK in the violence because the Dalit colony voted overwhelmingly for VCK.

In November 2020, Ramadoss called for a protest demanding 20% internal reservation for Vanniyars in the MBC category in education and jobs from 1 December. During the pro-reservation protests, more than 500 PMK cadres pelted stones on a moving train and blocked traffic when they were blocked from entering Chennai. A bill to create the 10.5% internal reservation to Vanniyars was passed on February 26, 2021, by the AIADMK government. The move was taken ahead of the April 6 assembly elections to appease the PMK, which had threatened to quit the coalition if their demand was not satisfied. In July 2021, the DMK government issued an order to implement 10.5% quota Bill for Vanniyars.

PMK contested in 23 seats in the AIADMK alliance in the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election and won five seats by securing 4.04%. In the assembly, PMK voted in favour of anti-CAA and anti-farm-law resolutions, but AIADMK and BJP walked out over the matter. PMK left the AIADMK-led alliance for the 2021 local body polls.

== Ideology and political positions ==
The PMK defied Tamil Nadu&#x27;s Dravidian political culture by explicitly appealing to its caste identification when asking for support. The party has been linked to direct action and protests that have resulted in violence. Between 2012 and 2013, the party ran a campaign against intercaste marriages.

<text>Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers was a country-comedy band that performed largely in the Midwest United States from the late 1930s into the 1960s.

==Members==

* Peter KunatzAccordion, piano.
* Gerald (Curley) MyersGuitar, banjo, vocals.
* Chuck KagyFiddle, guitar, mandolin.
* Buddy RossAccordion.
* Tony WalbergAccordion.

==History==
Tom C. Fouts, nicknamed Stubby for his stature, left Indiana Central University after a year, and in 1938 formed a band with five friends. The Six Hoosiers specialized in comedy, Fouts playing novelty instruments like a &quot;tuned toilet seat&quot; he called the &quot;gitarlet.&quot;

WDAN radio in Danville, Illinois signed them to a contract, and in 1940 held a contest to rename the Six Hoosiers. The $100 prizewinner suggested &quot;Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers&quot;. (During performances, Fouts would sometimes refer to them as &quot;Captain Stubby and the bucket of tears.&quot;)

Appropriately, the band joined the U.S. Navy in 1944, Entertainment Division, going overseas to entertain sailors. After World War II they signed with WLS Radio in Chicago and performed on the popular &quot;National Barn Dance&quot;, heard throughout the Midwest.

Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers eventually became regulars on the ABC-TV program Polka Go-Round. They also recorded with five labels, performing many of Fouts&#x27; songs. With singer Lola Dee, they recorded the Mercury Records single &quot;Padre&quot; and &quot;Takin&#x27; The Trains Out&quot;. Fouts was host of a syndicated talk show called &quot;Captain Stubby&#x27;s Special Delivery&quot;. He also wrote for and performed on the national Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club from 1968 until 1971.

==Advertising==
Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers first performed the original Roto-Rooter jingle on WLS in the early 1950s, and the recorded version became one of the longest-running tunes in the history of advertising, featuring Tom Fouts&#x27; bass voice in &quot;Away go Troubles Down the Drain.&quot; Shortly before his death at 85 in 2004, he contributed to nostalgic radio spots for Roto-Rooter.

Captain Stubby also sang the 1959 Chicago White Sox fight song, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Go-Go White Sox&quot;, and was the voice of Green Giant&#x27;s Little Sprout.

<doc id="1072943" wikidata="Q5473264" url="?curid=1072943" title="Forward algorithm">
<text>The forward algorithm, in the context of a hidden Markov model (HMM), is used to calculate a &#x27;belief state&#x27;: the probability of a state at a certain time, given the history of evidence. The process is also known as &quot;filtering&quot;. The forward algorithm is closely related to, but distinct from, the Viterbi algorithm.

==Introduction==
The forward and backward algorithms should be placed within the context of probability as they appear to simply be names given to a set of standard mathematical procedures within a few fields. For example, neither &quot;forward algorithm&quot; nor &quot;Viterbi&quot; appear in the Cambridge encyclopedia of mathematics. The main observation to take away from these algorithms is how to organize Bayesian updates and inference to be computationally efficient in the context of directed graphs of variables (see sum-product networks).

For an HMM such as this one:

this probability is written as formula_1. Here formula_2 is the hidden state which is abbreviated as formula_3 and formula_4 are the observations formula_5 to formula_6. 

The backward algorithm complements the forward algorithm by taking into account the future history if one wanted to improve the estimate for past times. This is referred to as &quot;smoothing&quot; and the forward/backward algorithm computes formula_7 for formula_8. Thus, the full forward/backward algorithm takes into account all evidence. Note that a belief state can be calculated at each time step, but doing this does not, in a strict sense, produce the most likely state &quot;sequence&quot;, but rather the most likely state at each time step, given the previous history. In order to achieve the most likely sequence, the Viterbi algorithm is required. It computes the most likely state sequence given the history of observations, that is, the state sequence that maximizes formula_9.

==Algorithm==
The goal of the forward algorithm is to compute the joint probability formula_10, where for notational convenience we have abbreviated formula_2 as formula_3 and formula_13 as formula_4. Once the joint probability formula_10 is computed, the other probabilities formula_16 and formula_17 are easily obtained. 

Both the state formula_3 and observation formula_19 are assumed to be discrete, finite random variables. The hidden Markov model&#x27;s state transition probabilities formula_20, observation/emission probabilities formula_21, and initial prior probability formula_22 are assumed to be known. Furthermore, the sequence of observations formula_4 are assumed to be given. 

Computing formula_10 naively would require marginalizing over all possible state sequences formula_25, the number of which grows exponentially with formula_6. Instead, the forward algorithm takes advantage of the conditional independence rules of the hidden Markov model (HMM) to perform the calculation recursively.

To demonstrate the recursion, let

::formula_27.

Using the chain rule to expand formula_28, we can then write

::formula_29.

Because formula_19 is conditionally independent of everything but formula_3, and formula_3 is conditionally independent of everything but formula_33, this simplifies to

::formula_34.

Thus, since formula_21 and formula_20 are given by the model&#x27;s emission distributions and transition probabilities, which are assumed to be known, one can quickly calculate formula_37 from formula_38 and avoid incurring exponential computation time. 

The recursion formula given above can be written in a more compact form. Let formula_39 be the transition probabilities and formula_40 be the emission probabilities, then

::formula_41

where formula_42 is the transition probability matrix, formula_43 is the i-th row of the emission probability matrix formula_44 which corresponds to the actual observation formula_45 at time formula_6, and formula_47 is the alpha vector. The formula_48 is the hadamard product between the transpose of formula_43 and formula_50.

The initial condition is set in accordance to the prior probability over formula_51 as 

::formula_52.

Once the joint probability formula_53 has been computed using the forward algorithm, we can easily obtain the related joint probability formula_17 as

::formula_55 

and the required conditional probability formula_16 as

::formula_57

Once the conditional probability has been calculated, we can also find the point estimate of formula_3. For instance, the MAP estimate of formula_3 is given by

::formula_60

while the MMSE estimate of formula_3 is given by 

::formula_62

The forward algorithm is easily modified to account for observations from variants of the hidden Markov model as well, such as the Markov jump linear system.

==Example==
This example on observing possible states of weather from the observed condition of seaweed. We have observations of seaweed for three consecutive days as dry, damp, and soggy in order. The possible states of weather can be sunny, cloudy, or rainy. In total, there can be formula_72 such weather sequences. Exploring all such possible state sequences is computationally very expensive. To reduce this complexity, Forward algorithm comes in handy, where the trick lies in using the conditional independence of the sequence steps to calculate partial probabilities, formula_73 as shown in the above derivation. Hence, we can calculate the probabilities as the product of the appropriate observation/emission probability, formula_21 ( probability of state formula_19 seen at time t from previous observation) with the sum of probabilities of reaching that state at time t, calculated using transition probabilities. This reduces complexity of the problem from searching whole search space to just using previously computed formula_76&#x27;s and transition probabilities.

==Complexity==
Complexity of Forward Algorithm is formula_77, where formula_78 is the number of hidden or latent variables, like weather in the example above, and formula_79 is the length of the sequence of the observed variable. This is clear reduction from the adhoc method of exploring all the possible states with a complexity of formula_80.

==Variants of the algorithm==
* Hybrid Forward Algorithm: A variant of the Forward Algorithm called Hybrid Forward Algorithm (HFA) can be used for the construction of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks with tunable nodes. The RBF neural network is constructed by the conventional subset selection algorithms. The network structure is determined by combining both the stepwise forward network configuration and the continuous RBF parameter optimization. It is used to efficiently and effectively produce a parsimonious RBF neural network that generalizes well. It is achieved through simultaneous network structure determination and parameter optimization on the continuous parameter space. HFA tackles the mixed integer hard problem using an integrated analytic framework, leading to improved network performance and reduced memory usage for the network construction.

* Forward Algorithm for Optimal Control in Hybrid Systems: This variant of Forward algorithm is motivated by the structure of manufacturing environments that integrate process and operations control. We derive a new property of the optimal state trajectory structure which holds under a modified condition on the cost function. This allows us to develop a low-complexity, scalable algorithm for explicitly determining the optimal controls, which can be more efficient than Forward Algorithm.

* Continuous Forward Algorithm: A continuous forward algorithm (CFA) can be used for nonlinear modelling and identification using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The proposed algorithm performs the two tasks of network construction and parameter optimization within an integrated analytic framework, and offers two important advantages. First, the model performance can be significantly improved through continuous parameter optimization. Secondly, the neural representation can be built without generating and storing all candidate regressors, leading to significantly reduced memory usage and computational complexity.

==History==
The forward algorithm is one of the algorithms used to solve the decoding problem. Since the development of speech recognition and pattern recognition and related fields like computational biology which use HMMs, the forward algorithm has gained popularity.

==Applications==
The forward algorithm is mostly used in applications that need us to determine the probability of being in a specific state when we know about the sequence of observations. The algorithm can be applied wherever we can train a model as we receive data using Baum-Welch or any general EM algorithm. The Forward algorithm will then tell us about the probability of data with respect to what is expected from our model. One of the applications can be in the domain of Finance, where it can help decide on when to buy or sell tangible assets.
It can have applications in all fields where we apply Hidden Markov Models. The popular ones include Natural language processing domains like tagging part-of-speech and speech recognition. Recently it is also being used in the domain of Bioinformatics.
Forward algorithm can also be applied to perform Weather speculations. We can have a HMM describing the weather and its relation to the state of observations for few consecutive days (some examples could be dry, damp, soggy, sunny, cloudy, rainy etc.). We can consider calculating the probability of observing any sequence of observations recursively given the HMM. We can then calculate the probability of reaching an intermediate state as the sum of all possible paths to that state. Thus the partial probabilities for the final observation will hold the probability of reaching those states going through all possible paths.

<text>Norman Otto Hipel (March 21, 1890 – February 16, 1953) was a Canadian politician, noted for his service as Minister of Labour for Ontario in the cabinet of Mitchell Hepburn. He served as MLA for Waterloo South.

==Personal background and career==

Hipel was born in rural Waterloo Township, Ontario near Breslau, Ontario on 21 March 1890, to parents Henry Hipel and Louisa Pelz. He received formal education at the Riverbank School and the Breslau Public School, but he left school early to help support his family, and began work as a store clerk in a Kitchener, Ontario dry goods store. He returned home in 1906 to learn carpentry from his father, and by 1911 had become a building contractor and, in 1913, he moved to Preston, Ontario, and in 1920 started his own construction company, N. O. Hipel Ltd, with ten employees, five horses and a portable sawmill. The company specialized in buildings that required large, uninterrupted floor space. In 1928 his company developed patents on barn and skating rink construction, and built a large number of arenas including the Hespeler Memorial Arena erected in 1947.

Hipel was a member of the Preston Board of Trade, the Ontario Club and was a president and director of the South Waterloo Agricultural Society. He was also a director on the Waterloo County Health Association board, and at the time of his death was also the Preston representative for the South Waterloo Memorial Hospital, now known as the Cambridge Memorial Hospital.

==Politics==

Hipel began his political career in 1921 when he ran for and was elected to the Preston town council. In 1922 he became the town&#x27;s reeve, and served as mayor in 1923 and 1924. In 1930 he ran successfully as the Ontario Liberal Party candidate to represent Waterloo South in the Ontario Legislature, and was re-elected in 1934. He served as Speaker of the House from 1935 to 1938, and was chosen to represent Ontario at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937. In 1938 Hipel was appointed Minister of Labour for Ontario in the cabinet of Mitchell Hepburn. As Minister of Labour, he organized the Farm Service Force to help in the harvesting of crops during World War II, and in 1939 he opened the Aircraft Mechanics Training School in Galt, where thousands were trained in radio operation and aircraft maintenance for the war effort. With help from the federal government, he also organized the War Emergency Training Program, providing education in manufacturing skilled required in the production of war materials. Hipel also served as Ontario Minister of Lands and Forests in 1941 and 1943. In this position, Hipel set aside forest lands and established a school at Dorset for the training of forest rangers.

<text>The Sor River or &quot;Sor Mañón&quot; flows between the provinces of A Coruña and Lugo, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It is long.

The river has an impressive waterfall called &quot;Augas Caídas&quot; in Mañon parish.

The river Sor is the only river with salmon in Galicia, since unlike others it has not yet been dammed to form a reservoir for hydroelectric generation.

The estuary of the River Sor is the Ria do Barqueiro, long. The river environment, geomorphology, and nearby landscape are of considerable interest.

<doc id="1072959" wikidata="Q7929497" url="?curid=1072959" title="Viking lander biological experiments">
<text>In 1976 two identical Viking program landers each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars. The first successful Mars landers, &quot;Viking 1&quot; and &quot;Viking 2&quot;, then carried out experiments to look for biosignatures of microbial life on Mars. The landers each used a robotic arm to pick up and place soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft.

The two landers carried out the same tests at two places on Mars&#x27; surface, &quot;Viking 1&quot; near the equator and &quot;Viking 2&quot; further north.

== The experiments ==
The four experiments below are presented in the order in which they were carried out by the two Viking landers. The biology team leader for the Viking program was Harold P. Klein (NASA Ames).

=== Gas chromatograph — mass spectrometer ===
A gas chromatograph — mass spectrometer (GCMS) is a device that separates vapor components chemically via a gas chromatograph and then feeds the result into a mass spectrometer, which measures the molecular weight of each chemical. As a result, it can separate, identify, and quantify a large number of different chemicals. The GCMS (PI: Klaus Biemann, MIT) was used to analyze the components of untreated Martian soil, and particularly those components that are released as the soil is heated to different temperatures. It could measure molecules present at a level of a few parts per billion.

The GCMS measured no significant amount of organic molecules in the Martian soil. In fact, Martian soils were found to contain less carbon than lifeless lunar soils returned by the Apollo program. This result was difficult to explain if Martian bacterial metabolism was responsible for the positive results seen by the Labeled Release experiment (see below). A 2011 astrobiology textbook notes that this was the decisive factor due to which &quot;For most of the Viking scientists, the final conclusion was that the &quot;Viking&quot; missions failed to detect life in the Martian soil.&quot;

Experiments conducted in 2008 by the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander discovered the presence of perchlorate in Martian soil. The 2011 astrobiology textbook discusses the importance of this finding with respect to the results obtained by &quot;Viking&quot; as &quot;while perchlorate is too poor an oxidizer to reproduce the LR results (under the conditions of that experiment perchlorate does not oxidize organics), it does oxidize, and thus destroy, organics at the higher temperatures used in the Viking GCMS experiment. NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay has estimated, in fact, that if &quot;Phoenix&quot;-like levels of perchlorates were present in the Viking samples, the organic content of the Martian soil could have been as high as 0.1% and still would have produced the (false) negative result that the GCMS returned. Thus, while conventional wisdom regarding the &quot;Viking&quot; biology experiments still points to &quot;no evidence of life&quot;, recent years have seen at least a small shift toward &quot;inconclusive evidence&quot;.&quot;

According to a 2010 NASA press release: &quot;The only organic chemicals identified when the Viking landers heated samples of Martian soil were chloromethane and dichloromethane -- chlorine compounds interpreted at the time as likely contaminants from cleaning fluids.&quot; According to a paper authored by a team led by Rafael Navarro-González of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, &quot;those chemicals are exactly what [their] new study found when a little perchlorate -- the surprise finding from Phoenix -- was added to desert soil from Chile containing organics and analyzed in the manner of the Viking tests.&quot; However, the 2010 NASA press release also noted that: &quot;One reason the chlorinated organics found by Viking were interpreted as contaminants from Earth was that the ratio of two isotopes of chlorine in them matched the three-to-one ratio for those isotopes on Earth. The ratio for them on Mars has not been clearly determined yet. If it is found to be much different than Earth&#x27;s, that would support the 1970s interpretation.&quot; Biemann has written a commentary critical of the Navarro-González and McKay paper, to which the latter have replied; the exchange was published in December 2011. In 2021 the chlorine isotope ratio on Mars was measured by the Trace Gas Orbiter and found to be almost indistinguishable from the terrestrial ratio, leaving the interpretation of the GCMS results inconclusive.

=== Gas exchange ===
The gas exchange (GEX) experiment (PI: Vance Oyama, NASA Ames) looked for gases given off by an incubated soil sample by first replacing the Martian atmosphere with the inert gas helium. It applied a liquid complex of organic and inorganic nutrients and supplements to a soil sample, first with just nutrients added, then with water added too. Periodically, the instrument sampled the atmosphere of the incubation chamber and used a gas chromatograph to measure the concentrations of several gases, including oxygen, CO2, nitrogen, hydrogen, and methane. The scientists hypothesized that metabolizing organisms would either consume or release at least one of the gases being measured.

In early November 1976, it was reported that &quot;on Viking 2, the gas exchange experiment is producing analogous results to those from Viking 1. Again, oxygen disappeared once the nutrient solution came into contact with the soil. Again, carbon dioxide began to appear and still continues to evolve&quot;.

=== Labeled release ===
The labeled release (LR) experiment (PI: Gilbert Levin, Biospherics Inc.) gave the most promise for exobiologists. In the LR experiment, a sample of Martian soil was inoculated with a drop of very dilute aqueous nutrient solution. The nutrients (7 molecules that were Miller-Urey products) were tagged with radioactive 14C. The air above the soil was monitored for the evolution of radioactive 14CO2 (or other carbon-based) gas as evidence that microorganisms in the soil had metabolized one or more of the nutrients. Such a result was to be followed with the control part of the experiment as described for the PR below. The result was quite a surprise, considering the negative results of the first two tests, with a steady stream of radioactive gases being given off by the soil immediately following the first injection. The experiment was done by both Viking probes, the first using a sample from the surface exposed to sunlight and the second probe taking the sample from underneath a rock; both initial injections came back positive. Sterilization control tests were subsequently carried out by heating various soil samples. Samples heated for 3 hours at 160 °C gave off no radioactive gas when nutrients were injected, and samples heated for 3 hours at 50 °C exhibited a substantial reduction in radioactive gas released following nutrient injection. A sample stored at 10 °C for several months was later tested showing significantly reduced radioactive gas release.

A CNN article from 2000 noted that &quot;Though most of his peers concluded otherwise, Levin still holds that the robot tests he coordinated on the 1976 Viking lander indicated the presence of living organisms on Mars.&quot; A 2006 astrobiology textbook noted that &quot;With unsterilized Terrestrial samples, though, the addition of more nutrients after the initial incubation would then produce still more radioactive gas as the dormant bacteria sprang into action to consume the new dose of food. This was not true of the Martian soil; on Mars, the second and third nutrient injections did not produce any further release of labeled gas.&quot; The 2011 edition of the same textbook noted that &quot;Albet Yen of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has shown that, under extremely cold and dry conditions and in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, ultraviolet light (remember: Mars lacks an ozone layer, so the surface is bathed in ultraviolet) can cause carbon dioxide to react with soils to produce various oxidizers, including highly reactive superoxides (salts containing O2−). When mixed with small organic molecules, superoxidizers readily oxidize them to carbon dioxide, which may account for the LR result. Superoxide chemistry can also account for the puzzling results seen when more nutrients were added to the soil in the LR experiment; because life multiplies, the amount of gas should have increased when a second or third batch of nutrients was added, but if the effect was due to a chemical being consumed in the first reaction, no new gas would be expected. Lastly, many superoxides are relatively unstable and are destroyed at elevated temperatures, also accounting for the &quot;sterilization&quot; seen in the LR experiment.&quot;

In a 2002 paper published by Joseph Miller, he speculates that recorded delays in the system&#x27;s chemical reactions point to biological activity similar to the circadian rhythm previously observed in terrestrial cyanobacteria.

A 2007 paper by Dirk Schulze-Makuch and Joop M. Houtkooper argues that the experiment may have killed potential microbes by supplying them with an excessive amount of water. Schulze-Makuch revisited the idea in an article for Big Think in 2023.

On 12 April 2012, an international team including Levin and Patricia Ann Straat published a peer reviewed paper suggesting the detection of &quot;extant microbial life on Mars&quot;, based on mathematical speculation through cluster analysis of the Labeled Release experiments of the 1976 Viking Mission.

=== Pyrolytic release ===
The pyrolytic release (PR) experiment (PI: Norman Horowitz, Caltech) consisted of the use of light, water, and a carbon-containing atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), simulating that on Mars. The carbon-bearing gases were made with carbon-14 (14C), a heavy, radioactive isotope of carbon. If there were photosynthetic organisms present, it was believed that they would incorporate some of the carbon as biomass through the process of carbon fixation, just as plants and cyanobacteria on earth do. After several days of incubation, the experiment removed the gases, baked the remaining soil at 650 °C (1200 °F), and collected the products in a device which counted radioactivity. If any of the 14C had been converted to biomass, it would be vaporized during heating and the radioactivity counter would detect it as evidence for life. Should a positive response be obtained, a duplicate sample of the same soil would be heated to &quot;sterilize&quot; it. It would then be tested as a control and should it still show activity similar to the first response, that was evidence that the activity was chemical in nature. However, a nil, or greatly diminished response, was evidence for biology. This same control was to be used for any of the three life detection experiments that showed a positive initial result. The initial assessment of results from the Viking 1 PR experiment was that &quot;analysis of the results shows that a small but significant formation of organic matter occurred&quot; and that the sterilized control showed no evidence of organics, showing that the &quot;findings could be attributed to biological activity.&quot; However, given the persistence of organic release at 90 °C, the inhibition of organics after injecting water vapor and, especially, the lack of detection of organics in the Martian soil by the GCMS experiment, the investigators concluded that a nonbiological explanation of the PR results was most likely. However, in subsequent years, as the GCMS results have come increasingly under scrutiny, the pyrolytic release experiment results have again come to be viewed as possibly consistent with biological activity, although &quot;An explanation for the apparent small synthesis of organic matter in the pyrolytic release experiment remains obscure.&quot;

== Scientific conclusions ==
Organic compounds seem to be common, for example, on asteroids, meteorites, comets and the icy bodies orbiting the Sun, so detecting no trace of any organic compound on the surface of Mars came as a surprise. The GC-MS was definitely working, because the controls were effective and it was able to detect traces of chlorine, attributed to the cleaning solvents that had been used to sterilize it prior to launch. A reanalysis of the GC-MS data was performed in 2018, suggesting that organic compounds may actually have been detected, corroborating with data from the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover. At the time, the total absence of organic material on the surface made the results of the biology experiments moot, since metabolism involving organic compounds were what those experiments were designed to detect. The general scientific community surmises that the Viking&#x27;s biological tests remain inconclusive, and can be explained by purely chemical processes.

Despite the positive result from the Labeled Release experiment, a general assessment is that the results seen in the four experiments are best explained by oxidative chemical reactions with the Martian soil. One of the current conclusions is that the Martian soil, being continuously exposed to UV light from the Sun (Mars has no protective ozone layer), has built up a thin layer of a very strong oxidant. A sufficiently strong oxidizing molecule would react with the added water to produce oxygen and hydrogen, and with the nutrients to produce carbon dioxide (CO2).

Norman Horowitz was the chief of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory bioscience section for the Mariner and Viking missions from 1965 to 1976. Horowitz considered that the great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide solutions, even exotic solutions, to the problems of survival of life on other planets. However, he also considered that the conditions found on Mars were incompatible with carbon based life.

In August 2008, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander detected perchlorate, a strong oxidizer when heated above 200 °C. This was initially thought to be the cause of a false positive LR result. However, results of experiments published in December 2010 propose that organic compounds &quot;could have been present&quot; in the soil analyzed by both &quot;Viking 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, since NASA&#x27;s Phoenix lander in 2008 detected perchlorate, which can break down organic compounds. The study&#x27;s authors found that perchlorate can destroy organics when heated and produce chloromethane and dichloromethane as byproduct, the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both Viking landers when they performed the same tests on Mars. Because perchlorate would have broken down any Martian organics, the question of whether Viking found organic compounds is still wide open, as alternative chemical and biological interpretations are possible.

In 2013, astrobiologist Richard Quinn at the Ames Center conducted experiments in which amino acids reacting with hypochlorite, which is created when perchlorate is irradiated with gamma rays, seemed to reproduce the findings of the labeled-release experiment. He concluded that neither hydrogen peroxide nor superoxide is required to explain the results of the Viking biology experiments. A more detailed study was conducted in 2017 by a team of researchers including Quinn. While this study was not specifically designed to match the data from the LR experiment, it was found that hypochlorite could partially explain the control results, including the 160 °C sterilization test. The authors stated &quot;Further experiments are planned to characterize the thermal stability of hypochlorite and other oxychlorine species in the context of the LR experiments.&quot;

== Controversy ==
Before the discovery of the oxidizer perchlorate on Mars in 2008, some theories remained opposed to the general scientific conclusion. An investigator suggested that the biological explanation of the lack of detected organics by GC-MS could be that the oxidizing inventory of the H2O2-H2O solvent well exceeded the reducing power of the organic compounds of the organisms.

It has also been argued that the Labeled Release (LR) experiment detected so few metabolising organisms in the Martian soil, that it would have been impossible for the gas chromatograph to detect them. This view has been put forward by the designer of the LR experiment, Gilbert Levin, who believes the positive LR results are diagnostic for life on Mars. He and others have conducted ongoing experiments attempting to reproduce the Viking data, either with biological or non-biological materials on Earth. While no experiment has ever precisely duplicated the Mars LR test and control results, experiments with hydrogen peroxide-saturated titanium dioxide have produced similar results.

While the majority of astrobiologists still conclude that the Viking biological experiments were inconclusive or negative, Gilbert Levin is not alone in believing otherwise. The current claim for life on Mars is grounded on old evidence reinterpreted in the light of recent developments. In 2006, scientist Rafael Navarro demonstrated that the Viking biological experiments likely lacked sensitivity to detect trace amounts of organic compounds. In a paper published in December 2010, the scientists suggest that if organics were present, they would not have been detected because when the soil is heated to check for organics, perchlorate destroys them rapidly producing chloromethane and dichloromethane, which is what the Viking landers found. This team also notes that this is not a proof of life but it could make a difference in how scientists look for organic biosignatures in the future. Results from the current Mars Science Laboratory mission and the under-development ExoMars program may help settle this controversy.

In 2006, Mario Crocco went as far as proposing the creation of a new nomenclatural rank that classified some Viking results as &#x27;metabolic&#x27; and therefore representative of a new form of life. The taxonomy proposed by Crocco has not been accepted by the scientific community, and the validity of Crocco&#x27;s interpretation hinged entirely on the absence of an oxidative agent in the Martian soil.

According to Gilbert Levin and Patricia Ann Straat, investigators of the LR experiment, no explanation involving inorganic chemistry as of 2016 is able to give satisfactory explanations of the complete data from the LR experiment, and specifically address the question of what active agent on the soil samples could be adversely affected by heating to approximately 50 °C and destroyed with long-term storage in the dark at 10 °C, as data suggest.

== Critiques ==

=== Failure to examine the atmosphere ===
James Lovelock argued that the Viking mission would have done better to examine the Martian atmosphere than look at the soil. He theorised that all life tends to expel waste gases into the atmosphere, and as such it would be possible to theorise the existence of life on a planet by detecting an atmosphere that was not in chemical equilibrium. He concluded that there was enough information about Mars&#x27; atmosphere at that time to discount the possibility of life there. Since then, methane has been discovered in Mars&#x27; atmosphere at 10ppb, thus reopening this debate. Although in 2013 the Curiosity rover failed to detect methane at its location in levels exceeding 1.3ppb. later in 2013 and in 2014, measurements by Curiosity did detect methane, suggesting a time-variable source. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, launched in March 2016, implements this approach and will focus on detection, characterization of spatial and temporal variation, and localization of sources for a broad suite of atmospheric trace gases on Mars and help determine if their formation is of biological or geological origin. The Mars Orbiter Mission has also been attempting – since late 2014 – to detect and map methane on Mars&#x27; atmosphere. 

Studies using the Trace Gas Orbiter and Curiosity have shown that methane is only detectable at night and therefore cannot be detected by the Trace Gas Orbiter which relies on sunlight for its measurements. 

=== Effects of landing rockets ===
A press commentary argued that, if there was life at the Viking lander sites, it may have been killed by the exhaust from the landing rockets. That is not a problem for missions which land via an airbag-protected capsule, slowed by parachutes and retrorockets, and dropped from a height that allows rocket exhaust to avoid the surface. Mars Pathfinder&#x27;s &quot;Sojourner&quot; rover and the Mars Exploration Rovers each used this landing technique successfully. The Phoenix Scout lander descended to the surface with retro-rockets, however, their fuel was hydrazine, and the end products of the plume (water, nitrogen, and ammonia) were not found to have affected the soils at the landing site.

<text>Pansy Yu Fong Wong (; born 1955) is a New Zealand former politician. 

Wong was a National Party Member of Parliament in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1996 to 2011. She was New Zealand&#x27;s first MP and first Cabinet minister of Asian ethnicity and served as Minister for Ethnic Affairs and Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs in the Fifth National Government. Wong resigned from Parliament in January 2011 after allegations of misusing parliamentary travel allowances.

==Early life and family==
Wong was born in Shanghai and raised in a one-room Hong Kong apartment by her mother, Pui Ching Chui, with her two brothers after her parents chose to leave Maoist China. Her father, Hung Shun Tsui, a seaman, was away most of the time for work. In Hong Kong, Wong took the English name Pansy and attended the Queen Elizabeth School.

The family emigrated to Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1974, when Wong was aged 19. While working in her parents&#x27; fish and chip shop, she studied commerce at University of Canterbury and graduated with a Master of Commerce.

She is married to Malaysian-born businessman Sammy Teck Seng Wong, whom she met at university. Sammy Wong was a justice of the peace from 1998 until his retirement in 2020 and had diverse business interests, including shareholder interests in the education, education, and transport industries.

Wong speaks English, Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese.

== Career ==
Wong&#x27;s early career was in business and accounting, including a period as chief financial controller at Smiths City. Eventually she turned to governance and worked as a professional director with several government appointments. 

In 1989, she was chair of the New Zealand Society of Accountants (Canterbury branch). The same year, she contested the Canterbury Regional Council, in the five-member Fitzgerald constituency, on the Christchurch Action team ticket. Of the ten Christchurch Action regional council candidates that year, Wong was the only one to be elected. During her seven years as a councillor, she chaired the finance committee and became known as the &quot;$6 million woman&quot; for overseeing budget cuts of that amount.

By 1991 Wong had been appointed by the Fourth National Government to the governing council of Lincoln University. She was reappointed to a second term, scheduled to end in February 1997, but she retired early upon her election to Parliament. In 1995, she was also appointed to the New Zealand Tourism Board.

==Member of Parliament==


Wong was encouraged to stand for Parliament by National MP for Fendalton Philip Burdon. She was selected as a list-only candidate for the National Party ahead of the 1996 general election. Based in Christchurch, she campaigned nationwide amongst Asian communities. Wong was elected as a list MP on 14 October 1996, becoming New Zealand&#x27;s first ethnically Asian MP. To mark her election, Wong released 130 balloons from the steps of Parliament, symbolising the 130 years since the first Chinese settlers arrived in New Zealand.

In her first term, she was appointed a member of the commerce committee and the justice and law reform committee. Her maiden statement, delivered on 19 March 1997, was described in &quot;The Dominion&quot; as &quot;a feisty attack on racism against migrants.&quot; She criticised the &quot;unfair targeting of Asian immigrants,&quot; some of which was instigated by National&#x27;s new partner in government, the New Zealand First party, but praised what she saw as the increasing acceptance of New Zealand&#x27;s multiculturalism. Wong rejected suggestions, including from Winston Peters, that she was a &quot;token&quot; representative for the Asian community and later said these events set her ambition of becoming an electorate representative to get a stronger mandate.

She supported Jenny Shipley in the 1997 New Zealand National Party leadership election and was thereafter appointed to shadow the consumer affairs portfolio. Wong took over the sponsorship of the Passive Resistance Sprays Reform Bill, originally in the names of Gail McIntosh and Joy McLauchlan, which would have enabled members of the public to carry items like mace for personal protection; the bill was defeated 52–68 in December 1998. She sought the Christchurch Central candidacy at the 1999 general election, but was unsuccessful. After the election, in which Wong was re-elected as a National Party list MP, she continued as a member of the commerce committee and was appointed spokesperson for energy and ethnic affairs, and associate spokesperson for commerce, in the Shipley shadow cabinet.

Ahead of the 2002 general election, Wong relocated to Auckland to contest the electorate of Auckland Central. She finished second to the incumbent, Judith Tizard. In her third term, Wong became deputy chair of the governance administration committee. She was spokesperson for ethnic affairs and tourism in the English shadow cabinet until 2003. The ethnic affairs portfolio was disestablished under Bill English&#x27;s successor Don Brash and Wong was made National&#x27;s liaison with the Asian community and allocated associate spokesperson roles related to education, immigration and revenue. She was returned as a list MP for the fourth time at the 2005 general election and was assigned the spokesperson portfolios in ethnic affairs and accident compensation by new leader John Key.

As National&#x27;s ethnic affairs spokesperson, Wong was outspoken for Asian communities. She advocated for more lenient immigration rules, like easier language tests, to support a greater number of Asian migrants into New Zealand. She dismissed the Labour government&#x27;s 2002 apology to the Chinese community for the historic poll tax as staged and paternalistic, although was criticised for upsetting the descendants of those affected who had worked to secure the apology. Wong, who was a proponent of Asian integration within New Zealand and did not believe there should be a stand-alone ethnic affairs ministry, continued to face political attacks on the basis of her ethnicity and accent.

Wong won the new electorate of Botany in the 2008 general election. Wong&#x27;s decision to change to Botany was based partly on the fact that 33% of the Botany electorate is Asian. She left Parliament in early 2011.

== Minister in the Fifth National Government ==
After the 2008 general election, Wong was appointed Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs, Associate Minister for ACC, and Associate Minister for Energy and Resources in the Fifth National Government. She said her appointment as New Zealand&#x27;s first Asian Cabinet minister showed &quot;New Zealand is a tolerant country where anyone can be accepted and succeed.&quot; In June 2009 she was additionally appointed an associate minister in the disability issues portfolio. While minister, Wong took ten overseas trips on ministerial business.

Wong&#x27;s ministerial career ended in scandal when it was claimed she improperly used her status to help her husband&#x27;s business interests while travelling in China. She resigned her positions when it emerged her husband, Sammy Wong, had accompanied her on ministerial visits overseas to conduct his business activities and used the address of her electoral office as the registered address for his businesses. An investigation concluded there was no systemic abuse of MPs&#x27; travel entitlements but ordered some costs to be repaid by the Wongs. The events led to a review and change to the entitlements. The Auditor-General considered investigating, but initially declined. However, an audit investigation into the Wongs was launched in 2011 which recommended further repayments, as well as law changes regarding MPs&#x27; expenses and entitlements, be made.

On 14 December 2010, Wong announced she would also resign from Parliament, effective from mid-January. She gave her valedictory statement on the same day. Jami-Lee Ross replaced her in the 2011 Botany by-election. She was succeeded in her ministerial portfolios by Hekia Parata.

== Awards and honours ==
In 1993, Wong was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

On 15 September 2011 Wong was granted the right to retain the title of &quot;the Honourable&quot; for her lifetime in recognition of her term as a member of the Executive Council.

<text>Street children are poor or homeless children who live on the streets of a city, town, or village. Homeless youth are often called street kids, or urchins; the definition of street children is contested, but many practitioners and policymakers use UNICEF&#x27;s concept of boys and girls, aged under 18 years, for whom &quot;the street&quot; (including unoccupied dwellings and wasteland) has become home and/or their source of livelihood, and who are inadequately protected or supervised. Street girls are sometimes called gamines, a term that is also used for Colombian street children of either sex.

Some street children, notably in more developed nations, are part of a subcategory called thrown-away children, consisting of children who have been forced to leave home. Thrown-away children are more likely to come from single-parent homes. Street children are often subject to abuse, neglect, exploitation, or, in extreme cases, murder by &quot;clean-up squads&quot; that have been hired by local businesses or police.

==Statistics and distribution==
Street children can be found in a large majority of the world&#x27;s famous cities, with the phenomenon more prevalent in densely populated urban hubs of developing or economically unstable regions, such as countries in Africa, South America, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia.

According to a report from 1988 of the Consortium for Street Children, a United Kingdom-based consortium of related non-governmental organizations (NGOs), UNICEF estimated that 100 million children were growing up on urban streets around the world. Fourteen years later, in 2002 UNICEF similarly reported, &quot;The latest estimates put the numbers of these children as high as one hundred million&quot;. More recently the organization added, &quot;The exact number of street children is impossible to quantify, but the figure almost certainly runs into tens of millions across the world. It is likely that the numbers are increasing.&quot; In an attempt to form a more reliable estimate, a statistical model based on the number of street children and relevant social indicators for 184 countries was developed; according to this model, there are 10 to 15 million street children in the world. Although it produced a statistically reliable estimate of the number of street children, the model is highly dependent on the definition of “street children,” national estimates, and data collected on the development level of the country, and it is thus limited in range. The one hundred million figure is still commonly cited for street children, but is not based on currently available academic research. Similarly, it is debatable whether numbers of street children are growing globally, or whether it is the awareness of street children within societies that has grown.

Comprehensive street level research, completed in the year 2000 in Cape Town proved that international estimates of tens of thousands of street children living on the streets of Cape Town were incorrect. This research proved, that even with street children begging at every intersection, rivers of street children sleeping on the pavements at night, and with gangs of street children roaming around the streets, there were less than 800 children living on the streets of greater Cape Town at this time. This insight enabled a whole new approach to street children to be developed, one not based on the provision of basic care to masses of street children, but one focused on helping individual children, on healing, educating, stabilizing, and developing them permanently away from street life, as well as managing the exploitation of street children and the support factors that keep them on the street.

==History==
In 1848, Lord Ashley referred to more than 30,000 &quot;naked, filthy, roaming lawless, and deserted children&quot; in and around London, UK. Among many English novels featuring them as a humanitarian problem are &quot;Jessica&#x27;s First Prayer&quot; by Sarah Smith (1867) and Georgina Castle Smith&#x27;s &quot;Nothing to Nobody&quot; (1872).

By 1922, there were at least seven million homeless children in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic due to the devastation from World War I and the Russian Civil War (see &quot;Orphans in the Soviet Union&quot;). Abandoned children formed gangs, created their own argot, and engaged in petty theft and prostitution.

==Causes==
The causes of this phenomenon are varied, but are often related to domestic, economic, or social disruption. This includes, but is not limited to: poverty; breakdown of homes and/or families; political unrest; ; sexual, physical or emotional abuse; domestic violence; being lured away by pimps, internet predators, or begging syndicates; mental health problems; substance abuse; and sexual orientation or gender identity issues. Children may end up on the streets due to cultural factors. For example, some children in parts of the Congo and Uganda are made to leave their families on suspicion of being witches who bring bad luck. In Afghanistan, young girls who are accused of &quot;honor crimes&quot; that shame their families and/or cultural practices may be forced to leave their homes ‒ this could include refusing an arranged marriage, or even being raped or sexually abused, if that is considered adultery in their culture.

==By country==
===Africa===

====Kenya====
UNICEF works with CARITAS and with other non-governmental organizations in Kenya to address street children. Rapid and unsustainable urbanization in the post-colonial period, which led to entrenched urban poverty in cities such as Nairobi, Kisumu, and Mombasa is an underlying cause of child homelessness. Rural-urban migration broke up extended families which had previously acted as a support network, taking care of children in cases of abuse, neglect, and abandonment.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has reported that glue sniffing is at the core of &quot;street culture&quot; in Nairobi, and that the majority of street children in the city are habitual solvent users. Research conducted by Cottrell-Boyce for the African Journal of Drug and Alcohol Studies found that glue sniffing amongst Kenyan street children was primarily functional – dulling the senses against the hardship of life on the street – but it also provided a link to the support structure of the ‘street family’ as a potent symbol of shared experience.

====South Africa====
Street Children are legally protected by the South African Children&#x27;s Act, Act 38 of 2005, which defines street children as &quot;children living, working and begging on the street&quot; and as &quot;Children in need of Care and Protection&quot;. South Africa has done much to address street children and the South African government now partially funds street children organisations. Parents of vulnerable children can access a monthly child care grant, and organisations have developed effective street outreach, drop-in centres, therapeutic residential care, and prevention and early intervention services for street children.

Comprehensive Street level research, completed in the year 2000 in Cape Town, proved that international estimates of tens of thousands of street children living on the street were incorrect. This research proved, that even with street children begging at every intersection, rivers of street children sleeping on the pavements at night, and with gangs of street children roaming around the streets, there were less than 800 children living on the streets of greater Cape Town at this time. This insight enabled a whole new approach to street children to be developed, one not based on the provision of basic care to masses of street children, but one focused on helping individual children, on healing, educating, stabilizing, and developing them permanently away from street life, as well as managing exploitation of street children and support factors that keep them on the street.

This approach has effectively reduced the number of children living on the streets of Cape Town by over 90%, even with over 200 children continuing to move onto the street each year. It has also seen absconding-from-care rates decline to less than 7%, and the success rate for getting children off the street has reached 80 to 90%. The number of street-vulnerable children, that is the number of chronically neglected, sexually and physically abused, traumatized community children, remains however unacceptably high, with school drop-out rates a real concern and with schools battling to deal with the high number of traumatised children they have to contend with.

====Sierra Leone====
Sierra Leone was considered to be the poorest nation in the world, according to the UN World Poverty Index 2008.

Whilst the current picture is more optimistic – World Bank projections for 2013/14 ranked Sierra Leone as having the second fastest-growing economy in the world – a prevalent lack of child rights and extreme poverty remain widespread.

There are close to 50,000 children relying upon the streets for their survival, a portion of them living full-time on the streets. There are also an estimated 300,000 children in Sierra Leone without access to education. Often neglected rural areas – of which there are many – offer little or no opportunity for children to break from the existing cycle of poverty.

===Asia===
====Bangladesh====

No recent statistics on street children in Bangladesh are available. UNICEF puts the number above 670,000 referring to a study conducted by Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, &quot;Estimation of the Size of Street Children and their Projection for Major Urban Areas of Bangladesh, 2005&quot;. About 36% of these children are in the capital city Dhaka according to the same study. Though Bangladesh improved the Human Capital Index over the decades, (HDI is 0.558 according to the 2014 HDR of UNDP and Bangladesh at 142 among 187 countries and territories), these children still represent the absolute lowest level in the social hierarchy. The same study projected the number of street children to be 1.14m in year 2014.

====India====

India has an estimated one million or more street children in each of the following cities: New Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai. When considering India as a whole, there are approximately 18 million children who earn their living off the streets in cities and rural areas. It is more common for street children to be male and the average age is fourteen. Although adolescent girls are more protected by families than boys are, when girls do break the bonds they are often worse off than boys are, as they are lured into prostitution. Due to the acceleration in economic growth in India, an economic rift has appeared, with just over thirty-two per cent of the population living below the poverty line. Owing to unemployment, increasing rural-urban migration, the attraction of city life, and a lack of political will, India has developed one of the largest child labor forces in the world.

====Indonesia====
According to a 2007 study, there were over 170,000 street children living in Indonesia. In 2000, about 1,600 children were living on the streets of Yogyakarta. Approximately five hundred of these children were girls between four and sixteen years of age. Many children began living on the streets after the 1997 Asian financial crisis in Indonesia. Girls living on the street face more difficulties than boys living on the street as often girls are abused by the street boys because of the patriarchal nature of the culture. &quot;They abuse girls, refuse to acknowledge them as street children, but liken them to prostitutes.&quot; Many girls become dependent on boyfriends; they receive material support in exchange for sex.

The street children in Indonesia are seen as a public nuisance. &quot;They are detained, subjected to verbal and physical abuse, their means of livelihood (guitars for busking, goods for sale) confiscated, and some have been shot attempting to flee the police.&quot;

====Iran====
There are between 60,000 and 200,000 street children in Iran (2016).

====Pakistan====

The number of street children in Pakistan is estimated to be between 1.2 million and 1.5 million. Issues like domestic violence, unemployment, natural disasters, poverty, unequal industrialization, unplanned rapid urbanization, family disintegration and lack of education are considered the major factors behind the increase in the number of street children. Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC) carried out a study which presented 56.5% of the children interviewed in Multan, 82.2% in Karachi, 80.5% in Hyderabad and 83.3% in Sukkur were forced to move on to the streets after the 2010 and 2011 floods.

====Philippines====

According to the 1998 report titled &quot;Situation of the Youth in the Philippines&quot;, there are about 1.5 million street children in the Philippines, 70% of which are boys. Street children as young as ten years old can be imprisoned alongside adults under the country&#x27;s Vagrancy Act; in past cases, physical and sexual abuse have occurred as a result of this legislation.

====Vietnam====
According to The Street Educators&#x27; Club, the number of street children in Vietnam has shrunk from 21,000 in 2003 to 8,000 in 2007. The number dropped from 1,507 to 113 in Hanoi and from 8,507 to 794 in Ho Chi Minh City. There are currently almost four hundred humanitarian organizations and international non-governmental organizations providing help to about 15,000 Vietnamese children.

==== North Korea ====

Ever since the North Korean famine in the 1990s, North Korea has hosted a large population of homeless children known as kotjebi, or &quot;flower swallows&quot; in Korean. In 2018, Daily NK reported that the government was interning kotjebi in kwalliso camps and that the children there were beginning to suffer from malnutrition due to low rations. In 2021 the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that hundreds of homeless orphans &quot;volunteered&quot; to work in manual labor projects, raising concerns over the possibility that homeless North Korean children were being conscripted into forced labor projects. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization also reported that homeless children faced increasing risks of starvation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent food security crisis.

===Europe===
====Greece====
Greece&#x27;s street child activity is heavily connected with human trafficking. In 2003, street children located in state-run facilities had disappeared. The disappearance is suspected to be linked to human trafficking. The numbers have decreased in recent years, and Greece has taken &quot;legislative action to criminalize human trafficking and related crimes&quot;, though Amnesty International reports that the problem still exists, and there is a failure of government protection and justice of trafficked children.

Begging and other street activities have been outlawed in Greece since 2003, but the recent unemployment hike has increased levels of these actions.

There are few programs for displaced children in Greece, which created a &quot;street child&quot; problem in the early 2000s. Giving foster parents to special needs children is not something the Greek government has done, leading to higher numbers of physically or mentally disabled street children. There are also deterrents for working and poor parents in Greece making them more willing to force their children to the streets. For example, orphans are given financial benefits, but if they live in state-run facilities they cannot receive these benefits. For working parents to get government subsidies, they often have to have more than one child.

====Romania====

The phenomenon of street children in Romania must be understood within the local historical context.
In 1966, in communist Romania, ruler Nicolae Ceauşescu outlawed contraception and abortion, enacting an aggressive natalist policy, in an effort to increase the population. As families were not able to cope, thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions. The struggle of families was made worse in the 1980s, when the state agreed to implement an austerity program in exchange for international loans, leading to a dramatic drop in living standards and to food rationing; and the fall of communism in December 1989 meant additional economic and social insecurity. Under such conditions, in the 1990s, many children moved onto the streets, with some being from the orphanages, while others being runaways from impoverished families. During the transition period from communism to market economy in the 1990s, social issues such as those of these children were low on the government&#x27;s agenda. Nevertheless, by the turn of the century things were improving. A 2000 report from the Council of Europe estimated that there were approximately 1,000 street children in the city of Bucharest. The prevalence of street children has led to a rapidly increasing sex tourism business in Romania; although, efforts have been made to decrease the number of street children in the country. The 2001 documentary film &quot;Children Underground&quot; documents the plight of Romanian street children, in particular their struggles with malnutrition, sexual exploitation, and substance abuse. In the 1990s, street children were often seen begging, inhaling &#x27;aurolac&#x27; from sniffing bags, and roaming around the Bucharest Metro. In the 21st century, the number of children living permanently on the streets dropped significantly, although more children worked on the streets all day, but returned home to their parents at night. By 2004, it was estimated that less than 500 children lived permanently in the streets in Bucharest, while less than 1,500 worked in the streets during the day, returning home to their families in the evening. By 2014, the street children of the 1990s were adults, and many were reported to be living &#x27;underground&#x27; in the tunnels and sewers
beneath the streets of Bucharest, with some having their own children.
====Russia====
In 2001, it was estimated that Russia had about one million street children, and one in four crimes involved underage individuals. Officially, the number of children without supervision is more than 700,000.

According to UNICEF, there were 64,000 homeless street children brought to hospitals by various governmental services (e.g. police) in 2005. In 2008, the number was 60,000.

====Sweden====
In 2012, unaccompanied male minors from Morocco started claiming asylum in Sweden. In 2014, 384 claimed asylum. Knowing that their chances of receiving refugee status was slim, they frequently ran away from the refugee housing to live on the streets.

In 2016, of the estimated 800 street children in Sweden, Morocco is the most prevalent country of origin. In 2016, the governments of Sweden and Morocco signed a treaty to facilitate their repatriation to Morocco. Efforts by authorities to aid the youth were declined by the youth who preferred living on the street and supporting themselves by crime. Morocco was initially reluctant to accept the repatriates, but as they could be identified using the Moroccan fingerprint database, repatriation could take place once Moroccan citizenship had been proven. Of the 77 males Morocco accepted, 65 had stated a false identity when claiming asylum to Sweden.

====Turkey====
Of Turkey&#x27;s 30,891 street children, 30,109 live in Istanbul, research conducted by the Turkish Prime Ministry&#x27;s Human Rights Presidency (BİHB) has shown. Of the street children, 20 were identified in Ankara, and Turkey&#x27;s third-largest city, İzmir, had none. Kocaeli Province was reported to have 687 street children while Eskişehir has 47. The research also revealed that 41,000 children are forced to beg on the streets, more than half of whom are found in Istanbul. Other cities with high figures include Ankara (6,700), Diyarbakır (3,300), Mersin (637) and Van (640).

Based on unofficial estimates, 88,000 children in Turkey live on the streets, and the country has the fourth-highest rate of underage substance abuse in the world. 4 percent of all children in Turkey are subject to sexual abuse, with 70 percent of the victims being younger than 10. Contrary to popular belief, boys are subject to sexual abuse as frequently as girls. In reported cases of children subject to commercial sexual exploitation, 77 percent of the children came from broken homes. Twenty-three percent lived with their parents, but in those homes domestic violence was common. The biggest risk faced by children who run away and live on the street is sexual exploitation. Children kidnapped from southeastern provinces are forced into prostitution here. Today, it is impossible to say for certain how many children in Turkey are being subjected to commercial sexual exploitation, but many say official information is off by at least 85 percent.

According to a study that sampled 54,928 students in Sanliurfa, Turkey, 7.5% of working children worked in the streets. 21.0% of the children spent the night outside and 37.4 % were obliged to spend the night outside since they work.

===America===
====United States====

The number of homeless children in the US grew from 1.2 million in 2007 to 1.6 million in 2010. The United States defines homelessness per the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The number of homeless children reached record highs in 2011, 2012, and 2013 at about three times their number in 1983.
An &quot;estimated two million [youth] run away from or are forced out of their homes each year&quot; in the United States. The difference in these numbers can be attributed to the temporary nature of street children in the United States, unlike the more permanent state in developing countries.

In the United States 83% of &quot;street children&quot; do not leave their state of origin. If they do leave their state of origin they are likely to end up in large cities, notably New York City, Los Angeles, Portland, and San Francisco. In the United States, street children are predominantly Caucasian, female, and 42% identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT).

The United States government has been making efforts since the late 1970s to accommodate this section of the population. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act of 1978 made funding available for shelters and funded the National Runaway Switchboard. Other efforts include the Child Abuse and Treatment Act of 1974, the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. There has also been a decline in arrest rates in street youth, dropping in 30,000 arrests from 1998 to 2007. Instead, the authorities are referring homeless youth to state-run social service agencies.

====Honduras====
In Honduras between 1998 and 2002, hundreds of street children were reportedly abducted, tortured and murdered by police and civilian &quot;cleanup squads&quot;.

===South America===

According to some estimates made in 1982 by UNICEF, there were forty million street children in Latin America, most of whom work on the streets, but they do not necessarily live on the streets. A majority of the street children in Latin America are males between the ages of 10 and 14. There are two categories of street children in Latin America: home-based and street-based. Home-based children have homes and families to return to, while street-based children do not. A majority of street children in Latin America are home-based.

====Brazil====
The Brazilian government estimates that the number of children and adolescents in 2012 who work or sleep on the streets was approximately 23,973, based on results from the national census mandated by the Human Rights Secretariat of the Presidency (SDH) and the Institute for Sustainable Development (Idesp).

===Oceania===
====Australia====
As of 2016, around 24,200 Australian youth were listed as homeless. The majority of homeless youth are located in the State of New South Wales. Youth homelessness has been subject to a number of independent studies, some calling for the Australian Human Rights Commission to conduct an inquiry on the matter.

== Government and non-government responses ==
===Responses by governments===
While some governments have implemented programs to deal with street children, the general solution involves placing the children into orphanages, juvenile homes, or correctional institutions. Efforts have been made by various governments to support or partner with non-government organizations. In Colombia, the government has tried to implement programs to put these children in state-run homes, but efforts have largely failed, and street children have become a victim group of social cleansing by the National Police because they are assumed to be drug users and criminals. In Australia, the primary response to homelessness is the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP). The program is limited in its effectiveness. An estimated one in two young people who seek a bed from SAAP are turned away because services are full.

===Public approaches to street children===
There are four categories of how societies deal with street children: correctional model, rehabilitative model, outreach strategies, and preventive approach. There is no significant benefit when comparing therapeutic interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy and family therapy with standard services such as drop-in center.

*The correctional model is primarily used by governments and the police. They view children as a public nuisance and risk to security of the general public. The objective of this model would be to protect the public and help keep the kids away from a life of crime. The methods this model uses to keep the children away from the life of crime are the juvenile justice system and specific institutions.
*The rehabilitative model is supported by churches and NGOs. The view of this model is that street children are damaged and in need of help. The objective of this model is to rehabilitate children into mainstream society. The methods used to keep children from going back to the streets are education, drug detoxification programs, and providing children with a safe family-like environment.
*The outreach strategy is supported by street teachers, NGOs, and church organizations. This strategy views &quot;street children&quot; as oppressed individuals in need of support from their communities. The objective of the Outreach strategy is to empower the &quot;street children&quot; by providing outreach education and training to support children.
*The preventive approach is supported by NGOs, the coalition of &quot;street children&quot;, and lobbying governments. They view street children&#x27;s poor circumstances from negative social and economic forces. In order to help street children, this approach focuses on the problems that cause children to leave their homes for the street by targeting parents&#x27; unemployment, poor housing campaign for children&#x27;s rights.

===NGO responses===
Non-government organizations employ a wide variety of strategies to address the needs and rights of street children. One example of an NGO effort is &quot;The Street Children‘s Day&quot;, launched by Jugend Eine Welt on 31 January 2009 to highlight the situation of street children. The &quot;Street Children&#x27;s Day&quot; has been commemorated every year since its inception in 2009.

Street children differ in age, gender, ethnicity, and social class, and these children have had different experiences throughout their lifetimes. UNICEF differentiates between the different types of children living on the street in three different categories: candidates for the street (street children who work and hang out on the streets), children on the streets (children who work on the street but have a home to go to at night), and children of the street (children who live on the street without family support).[45]

Horatio Alger&#x27;s book, &quot;Tattered Tom; or, The Story of a Street Arab&quot; (1871), is an early example of the appearance of street children in literature. The book follows the tale of a homeless girl who lives by her wits on the streets of New York City. Other examples from popular fiction include Kim, from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s novel of the same name, who is a street child in colonial India. Gavroche, in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Fagin&#x27;s crew of child pickpockets in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, a similar group of child thieves in Cornelia Funke&#x27;s &quot;The Thief Lord&quot;, and Sherlock Holmes&#x27; &quot;Baker Street Irregulars&quot; are other notable examples of the presence of street children in popular works of literature.

During the mid-1970s in Australia, a number of youth refuges were established. These refuges were founded by local youth workers, providing crisis accommodation, and soon began getting funding from the Australian government. In New South Wales, these early refuges include Caretakers Cottage, Young People&#x27;s Refuge, and Taldemunde among others. Within years of their founding, these refuges began receiving funding from the Department of Family and Community Services.

<text>Ernest Clayton Walker Jr. (born August 19, 1969) is an American country music artist. He made his debut in 1993 with the single &quot;What&#x27;s It to You&quot;, which reached Number One on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart, as did its follow-up, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Live Until I Die&quot;. Both singles were included on his self-titled debut album, released in 1993 via Giant Records. He stayed with the label until its 2001 closure, later recording for Warner Bros. Records, RCA Records Nashville, and Curb Records.

Clay Walker has released a total of eleven studio albums, including a greatest hits package and an album of Christmas music. His first four studio albums all achieved platinum certification in the United States and his greatest hits collection and fifth studio album were each certified gold. He has charted more than thirty singles on Hot Country Songs, of which six have reached number one: &quot;What&#x27;s It to You&quot;, &quot;Live Until I Die&quot;, &quot;Dreaming with My Eyes Open&quot;, &quot;If I Could Make a Living&quot;, &quot;This Woman and This Man&quot;, and &quot;Rumor Has It&quot;.

==Biography==
Ernest Clayton Walker Jr. was born on August 19, 1969, in Beaumont, Texas, to Ernest and Danna Walker. The oldest of five children, Walker lived in Vidor with his mother and stepfather. His father, Clay Sr., gave him a guitar when he was nine years old. Walker began entering talent competitions at age 15. After leaving his shift as nighttime desk clerk at a Super 8 Motel, he stopped at a local radio station to deliver a tape of a song that he had written. Although the morning disc jockey told him that the station&#x27;s policies prohibited playing self-submitted tapes, he played Walker&#x27;s song and said that it was &quot;too good to pass up.&quot;

After graduating from Vidor High School in 1986, Walker began working at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant. At 19, he also began touring as a musician, playing various local clubs and eventually finding work as the house singer at a bar in Beaumont called the Neon Armadillo. In November 1992, he was discovered by James Stroud, a record producer who was also the president of Warner Music Group subsidiary Giant Records.

==Musical career==
===1993–94: &quot;Clay Walker&quot;===
Walker released his self-titled debut album in 1993 under Stroud&#x27;s production. Its first single was &quot;What&#x27;s It to You&quot;; written by Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright, this song reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and number 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Its followup &quot;Live Until I Die&quot; (which Walker wrote), was released late in the year and became his second consecutive No. 1 in early 1994. After those two singles came the number 11 &quot;Where Do I Fit in the Picture&quot;, which was originally the B-side of &quot;What&#x27;s It to You.&quot; The album accounted for a third No. 1 hit in &quot;Dreaming with My Eyes Open&quot;, a song that was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1993 film &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot;. An additional cut from the album, &quot;White Palace,&quot; charted at number 67 on the country charts without being released as a single.

&quot;Clay Walker&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of one million copies. It peaked at number 8 on Top Country Albums, number 2 on Top Heatseekers and number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Larry Powell of Allmusic gave the album a four-and-a-half star rating, saying that Walker had a &quot;high-energy&quot; voice reminiscent of Conway Twitty. Walker also received two award nominations in 1994: Favorite Country New Artist from the American Music Awards and Top New Male Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music, as well as a nomination in 1995 at the TNN/Music City News Country Awards for Male Star of Tomorrow.

===1994–96: &quot;If I Could Make a Living&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize the Moon&quot;===
&quot;If I Could Make a Living&quot; was the title of Walker&#x27;s second album, released in 1994. It produced two more No. 1 singles in the title track (co-written by Alan Jackson, Keith Stegall, and Roger Murrah) and 1995&#x27;s &quot;This Woman and This Man&quot;. The latter song spent two weeks at No. 1, becoming his first multi-week No. 1 hit. Then came the number 16 &quot;My Heart Will Never Know&quot;. &quot;If I Could Make a Living&quot; went platinum in May 1995, reaching number 2 on the country albums chart. Gordon Ely of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; gave a favorable review, saying that &quot;Walker has broken loose from Nashville&#x27;s most recent crop of carefully crafted cowboys.&quot; Walker also began touring in 1995 as a headlining act, in support of the album.

Late in 1995, Walker released his third studio album, titled &quot;Hypnotize the Moon&quot;. Although none of its singles reached No. 1, &quot;Hypnotize the Moon&quot; produced two consecutive number 2 hits in &quot;Who Needs You Baby&quot; (which Walker co-wrote) and the title track, followed by the number 5 &quot;Only on Days That End in &#x27;Y&#x27;&quot; and the number 18 &quot;Bury the Shovel&quot;. &quot;Hypnotize the Moon&quot; was certified platinum in 1996, making for Walker&#x27;s third consecutive platinum album. This album received a four-star rating from Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who said that it was his &quot;most assured, cohesive album to date&quot; and that he gave a &quot;consistently excellent performance.&quot; Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that Walker did not show a distinct musical personality, but considered the song selection strong and gave it a B+. Richard McVey II of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; considered it a &quot;throwback&quot; in sound to Walker&#x27;s debut, while &quot;USA Today&quot; said that it lacked the &quot;verve&quot; of that album.

===1996–97: &quot;Rumor Has It&quot;===
Having just completed the tracks for his fourth album in 1996, Walker was playing basketball with a friend, when he began to experience numbness, facial spasms, and double vision. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that he had multiple sclerosis (MS). Walker subsequently began changing his diet and treating the disease with a daily injection of Copaxone, sending his MS into an arrested state.

Also in early 1996, Nu Millennia Media released &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, which included five of Walker&#x27;s songs in an interactive CD-ROM format and 30 minutes of video footage. He then released his fourth album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Rumor Has It&quot;, which he co-produced with Stroud. Its title track, the first single, became his sixth and final No. 1 single that year. Other singles from the album included the number 18 &quot;One, Two, I Love You&quot; and the Top 5 hits &quot;Watch This&quot; and &quot;Then What?&quot; at number 4 and number 2, respectively. The latter also reached number 65 on the Hot 100, making for his first entry on that chart since &quot;What&#x27;s It to You.&quot; As with his three previous studio albums, &quot;Rumor Has It&quot; was certified platinum. Larry Stephens of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; gave this album a mostly-negative review, calling the songs &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; outside &quot;I Need a Margarita&quot;. Thom Owens of Allmusic also thought that it was formulaic, but said that Walker was &quot;able to make even mediocre material sound good&quot;, rating it three stars out of five.

===1998–2000: &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot;===
In April 1998, Walker charted with a live rendition of Earl Thomas Conley&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Holding Her and Loving You&quot;. This rendition spent nine weeks on the charts and peaked at number 68. One month later, he debuted his sixteenth single, &quot;Ordinary People&quot;. Peaking at number 35, it was one of two new songs included on his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album; the other new track, &quot;You&#x27;re Beginning to Get to Me&quot;, made its debut in August 1998 and peaked at number 2 on the country chart and number 39 on the Hot 100 in January 1999, the same month in which &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was certified gold. Also in 1998, Walker performed a sold-out show at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

Doug Johnson, who succeeded Stroud as Giant Records&#x27; president, produced Walker&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot;. Regarding its production and promotion, the label&#x27;s senior director of marketing Connie Baer said that she wanted to raise Walker&#x27;s profile as an artist, as both she and Johnson thought that he did not have the same level of recognition as other artists with similar album sales and chart success. This album was led off by the number 16 country and number 74 pop hit &quot;She&#x27;s Always Right&quot;, which was co-written by Lonestar&#x27;s lead singer Richie McDonald. After this song came the title track at number 11 country and number 65 pop. &quot;The Chain of Love&quot;, written by Rory Lee Feek and Jonnie Barnett, was the album&#x27;s third and most successful single, reaching number 3 country and number 40 on the Hot 100. Both it and &quot;Once in a Lifetime Love&quot;, the fourth single, first charted from unsolicited airplay received while &quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot; was climbing the charts. &quot;Once in a Lifetime Love&quot;, upon its release, became his lowest-peaking single release, reaching number 50. The album also included a studio version of the Earl Thomas Conley cover.

Erlewine gave the album three stars on Allmusic, where he wrote that it &quot;never really distinguishes itself from its predecessors&quot; but &quot;has its moments.&quot; Brian Wahlert of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; also thought that the album was inconsistent, saying that &quot;She&#x27;s Always Right&quot;, &quot;The Chain of Love&quot;, and the Conley cover were its strongest tracks, but that the rest &quot;treads no new ground.&quot; Deborah Evans Price of &quot;Billboard&quot; was more favorable, saying that it showed the energy of his live shows, and that he &quot;cut loose&quot; with soul singing on &quot;This Time Love.&quot;

In late 2000, Walker recorded two tracks on &quot;Believe: A Christmas Collection&quot;, a multi-artist Christmas music album released by Giant. These two tracks — a cover version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; and the original song &quot;Cowboy Christmas&quot; — both made appearances on the country chart, reaching number 51 and number 70, respectively.

===2001–02: &quot;Say No More&quot; and &quot;Christmas&quot;===
Walker released his twenty-third single, &quot;Say No More&quot;, for Giant in early 2001. It was the first single release (and the title track) from his sixth studio album, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write &quot;If You Ever Feel Like Lovin&#x27; Me Again&quot;, reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant&#x27;s parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens&#x27;s &quot;La Bamba.&quot; Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that &quot;the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it makes you want to run right out and hug the one you love.&quot; &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being &quot;full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés.&quot;

In 2002, Walker wrote and recorded a song for the National Football League&#x27;s expansion team, the Houston Texans. Titled &quot;Football Time in Houston,&quot; the song was used as the team&#x27;s official fight song during its inaugural season. In an interview with CMT, he said that he donated the song to the city of Houston, and that he sings &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the team&#x27;s opening game every season.

Although he had left Warner Bros. for RCA Records&#x27; Nashville division in May 2002, Warner Bros. released a Christmas music album entitled &quot;Christmas&quot; in September of the same year. It included a cover of José Feliciano&#x27;s &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot;, which Walker took to number 49 on the country chart in January 2003.

===2003–04: &quot;A Few Questions&quot;===
Walker&#x27;s first single release for RCA, &quot;A Few Questions&quot;, debuted in April 2003. The song spent twenty-seven weeks on the country charts and peaked at number 9, making for his first top ten entry since &quot;The Chain of Love&quot; three years previous. This was the first single from his only RCA album, also titled &quot;A Few Questions&quot;, which he produced with Jimmy Ritchey. Its second single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Sleep,&quot; which Walker co-wrote with Chely Wright, also peaked at number 9 in early 2004. The third and final single was the number 31 &quot;Jesus Was a Country Boy&quot;, which Walker wrote with Rivers Rutherford. &quot;A Few Questions&quot; accounted for his second-highest peak on the country albums charts, reaching number 3.

Erlewine rated this album two-and-a-half stars out of five on Allmusic. He considered the album more country pop-oriented than Walker&#x27;s work for Giant, saying that this change in sound made it not &quot;feel like a Clay Walker album.&quot; Dan McIntosh gave a mostly-negative review for &quot;Country Standard Time&quot;, where he wrote that &quot;even his passionate singing cannot rise above this album&#x27;s predictable lyrics and lame arrangements.&quot;

===2005–08: &quot;Fall&quot;===
Walker was signed his third record deal in July 2005, this time with the Asylum-Curb division of Curb Records. His first single for the label, &quot;&#x27;Fore She Was Mama,&quot; reached a peak of number 21 in March 2007. It was included on his album &quot;Fall&quot;, which was produced by Keith Stegall. The album&#x27;s title cut, &quot;Fall,&quot; was written by Clay Mills along with former Mercury Records artist Shane Minor and former Exile member Sonny LeMaire. It was the second single release from &quot;Fall&quot;, going to number 5 on the country charts and number 55 on the Hot 100. The album&#x27;s third and final single was &quot;She Likes It in the Morning&quot;, with a number 43 country peak. &quot;Fall&quot; also included a duet with Freddy Fender, the first duet of Walker&#x27;s career, on a cover of Fender&#x27;s debut single &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls.&quot; Walker and Fender recorded this duet in early 2006; Fender died of lung cancer in October of the same year.

Erlewine gave a three-and-a-half star rating, saying that Stegall&#x27;s production gave it a more traditional sound in comparison to &quot;A Few Questions&quot;, and that, despite having some &quot;sappy&quot; songs, it was his &quot;most enjoyable collection in some time.&quot; Engine 145 reviewer Brady Vercher rated it three stars out of five, praising Walker&#x27;s vocal performance but saying that the song selection &quot;seemed to be lacking in everything but fluff.&quot; &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; reviewer Jeffrey B. Remz wrote that Walker showed &quot;a very pleasant country voice with a good sense of emotion&quot; and that the production was more country-sounding than most mainstream acts, but said that it had several &quot;generic&quot; songs.

===2009–2014: &quot;She Won&#x27;t Be Lonely Long&quot; and &quot;Best Of Clay Walker&quot;===
Walker&#x27;s second album for Asylum-Curb was first announced in June 2009. Its first single, &quot;She Won&#x27;t Be Lonely Long&quot;, was given an official release date of December 2009, although it had already entered the country charts in late November. In advance of his ninth album, Walker released an extended play titled &quot;She Won&#x27;t Be Lonely Long&quot;. The album, also titled &quot;She Won&#x27;t Be Lonely Long&quot;, was released on June 8, 2010. It includes a cover of Alabama&#x27;s 1980 single &quot;Feels So Right&quot; with a backing vocal from Alabama&#x27;s lead singer, Randy Owen. Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek praised the album for its &quot;straight-up, mainstream contemporary country&quot; sound but said that it did not reflect a change in sound from &quot;Fall&quot;.

&quot;She Won&#x27;t Be Lonely Long&quot; peaked at number 4 on the country chart in mid-2010. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Where Do I Go from You&quot;, was released to radio on August 2, 2010, with &quot;Like We Never Said Goodbye&quot; following in late 2011. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Jesse James&quot; was released in 2012 under Curb&#x27;s Sidewalk Records imprint. In 2014, Curb issued a compilation titled &quot;The Best of Clay Walker&quot;, which included singles from &quot;Fall&quot; and &quot;She Won&#x27;t Be Lonely Long&quot;, along with re-recordings of songs from when he was on Giant.

===2015–2019: &quot;Long Live the Cowboy&quot;===
In November 2015, Walker released a new single entitled &quot;Right Now&quot;. Despite a recording hiatus, Walker continued to perform infrequently between 2015 and 2017. Much of his length between releases was due to lingering effects of multiple sclerosis. On April 13, 2018, Walker released the second single titled &quot;Working On Me&quot; from his then still unconfirmed album. During a live blog on his social media sites on December 21, 2018, Walker announced that he would be releasing a song titled &quot;She Gets What She Wants&quot; at midnight on December 24. During the live blog Walker also stated that the album would be titled &quot;Long Live the Cowboy&quot; and it would be released in January 2019. &quot;Long Live the Cowboy&quot; was finally released independently in January 2019, and it includes the singles previously released.

===2020–2021: &quot;Texas to Tennessee&quot;===
In August 2020, Walker signed with Show Dog Nashville, and announced that his first single for the label, &quot;Need a Bar Sometimes&quot;, would be released on August 14, 2020. In February 2021, &quot;Need a Bar Sometimes&quot; charted at number 59 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, becoming Walker&#x27;s first chart entry in more than 8 years. Walker&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Texas to Tennessee&quot;, was released by Show Dog Nashville in July 2021.

==Musical image and influences==
In 1994, Bob Cannon of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Walker&#x27;s image of a &quot;Resistol hat, sturdy cowpoke face, and very tight jeans&quot; seemed to be from a &quot;Country Music Handbook for Success,&quot; but also said that he &quot;ignores the danger of being dismissed as just another hunk in a hat.&quot; Walker has been compared to Mark Chesnutt and Tracy Byrd, both of whom are also Beaumont, Texas, natives who began their careers shortly before Walker did. Of the comparison among the three, Rick Koster wrote in the book &quot;Texas Music&quot; that Walker&#x27;s success came more quickly than that of Chesnutt or Byrd. Kurt Wolff and Orla Duane, authors of &quot;Country Music: The Rough Guide&quot;, said that he &quot;had loads of youthful energy, a golden Texas twang, and, of course, plenty of boyish good looks.&quot; They also called his music &quot;relatively tame&quot; but said that &quot;his Texas bar-room roots remain clearly visible in his voice and songs.&quot; Regarding Walker&#x27;s onstage persona, former Warner Bros. executive Bill Mayne told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in 1997 that Walker has &quot;maintained a low profile&quot; but that he &quot;really touches people and connects.&quot;

Walker described his voice to CMT as &quot;raspy [and] rugged.&quot; He cites George Jones (also a Beaumont native) as a primary influence, as well as James Taylor and Bob Seger; he has also said that, because he grew up in a largely African-American neighborhood, his singing style was influenced by rhythm and blues music. In addition, he said that after his diagnosis, he realized that &quot;you need to love your family&quot; and said that, because he considered his songs positive in nature, he felt that he could connect to younger listeners.

==Personal life==
Before the release of his first single, Walker married a rodeo queen named Lori Jayne Lampson. They had two daughters: MaClay DaLayne, born on January 14, 1996; and Skylor ClayAnne, born on May 14, 1999. The couple divorced in 2006. He married model Jessica Craig on September 28, 2007 and had five more children with her: a son named William Clayton, born August 5, 2008; a daughter named Mary Elizabeth, born December 27, 2009; and two more sons Elijah Craig and Ezra Stephen, born November 4, 2017. On August 7, 2020, it was announced that Walker and his wife would be welcoming a fifth child together, a son named Christiaan Michael, born January 2021.

Walker has participated in several forms of charity to help raise awareness of multiple sclerosis following his diagnosis in 1996, including his own non-profit charity, Band Against MS, which he founded in 2003. In 2008, he received a Humanitarian Award for his charitable efforts in relations to MS and participated in a charity golf tournament benefiting his organization.

<doc id="1072974" wikidata="Q144396" url="?curid=1072974" title="Zaynab bint Jahsh">
<text>Zaynab bint Jaḥsh (; ), was the first cousin and the seventh wife of Muhammad and therefore, considered by Muslims to be a Mother of the Believers.

==Early life==
Zaynab&#x27;s father was Jahsh ibn Riyab, an immigrant from the Asad ibn Khuzaymah tribe who had settled in Mecca under the protection of the Umayya clan. Her mother was Umayma bint Abd al-Muttalib, a member of the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe and a sister of Muhammad&#x27;s father. Hence Zaynab and her five siblings were the first cousins of Muhammad.

She was a skilled tanner and leather-worker. She continued with this line of work throughout her life, even after she no longer needed the money.

==Marriage(s)==
===First marriage===
Zaynab&#x27;s first marriage was likely before Islam. The name of her first husband is not known to history, but it is mentioned that he had died by the time of &quot;Hijrah&quot; in the year of 622 CE. At that time Zaynab, who had become a Muslim, was among those who accompanied her brother Abdullah on the &quot;Hijrah&quot; to Medina.

===Marriage to Zayd===
====Circumstances of the marriage====
Around 625, Muhammad proposed Zaynab to marry his adopted son, Zayd ibn Harithah. Zayd had been born into the Kalb tribe but as a child he had been kidnapped by slave-traders. He had been sold to a nephew of Khadija bint Khuwaylid, who in her turn had given him as a wedding present to her husband Muhammad. After some years, Muhammad had manumitted Zayd and had adopted him as his son.

Zaynab, supported by her brother Abdullah, at first refused the proposal on the grounds that, &quot;I am a widow of the Quraysh.&quot; She presumably implied that her social status was too high to allow her to marry an ex-slave. It has been asserted that these social differences were precisely the reason why Muhammad wanted to arrange the marriage:

&quot;The Prophet was well aware that it is a person’s standing in the eyes of Allah that is important, rather than his or her status in the eyes of the people... their marriage would demonstrate that it was not who their ancestors were, but rather their standing in the sight of Allah, that mattered.&quot;

It has also been suggested that he wanted to establish the legitimacy and right to equal treatment of the adopted. By contrast, Montgomery Watt points out that Zayd was high in Muhammad&#x27;s esteem.

&quot;She can hardly have thought that he was not good enough. She was an ambitious woman, however, and may already have hoped to marry Muhammad; or she may have wanted to marry someone with whom Muhammad did not want his family to be so closely allied.&quot;

When Muhammad announced a new verse of the Qur&#x27;an: 

Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd. Muhammad personally paid the dower of 160 &quot;dirhams&quot; in cash, a cloak and veil, a coat of armour, 50 &quot;mudd&quot; of grain and 10 &quot;mudd&quot; of dates.

====Circumstances of the divorce====
The marriage lasted less than two years.

A story rejected by Muslim scholars but was inaccurately proposed by the 9th-century historians Ibn Sa&#x27;d and al-Tabari, was that Muhammad paid a visit to Zayd&#x27;s house. The hairskin curtain that served as Zayd&#x27;s front door was blown aside, accidentally revealing Zaynab dressed only in her shift. Zaynab arose to dress herself, advising Muhammad that Zayd was not at home but he was welcome to visit. However, he did not enter. He exclaimed to himself, “Praise be to Allah, who turns hearts around!” and then departed. When Zayd came home, Zaynab told him what had happened. Zayd went to Muhammad, saying: &quot;Prophet, I have heard about your visit. Perhaps you admire Zaynab, so I will divorce her.&quot; Muhammad replied, &quot;No, fear Allah and keep your wife.&quot;

The story has been rejected by Muslim scholars mainly because of its lack of having any chain of narration and its complete absence from any authentic hadith. Some commentators have found it absurd that Muhammad would suddenly become aware of Zaynab&#x27;s beauty one day after having known her all her life. If her beauty had been the reason for Muhammad to marry her, he would have married her himself in the first place rather than arranging her marriage to Zayd. 

Historiographic assessments suggest that the &quot;lovestruck&quot; narrative itself was a fabrication that developed over a century after the death of Muhammad.

Zayd divorced Zaynab in December 626.

===Marriage to Muhammad===
====Preparation for the marriage====
Muhammad expected criticism if he married Zaynab. Pre-Islamic custom disapproved of marriage between a man and his adopted son&#x27;s former wife. Arab society would have viewed this union as profoundly wrong, because it was considered an adopted son was truly a &quot;son&quot;. Therefore, for a man to marry his adopted son&#x27;s wife - even if she was divorced - was considered incestuous. As a result, he &quot;hid in his heart&quot; the idea that he might marry her. This internal conflict is mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an :

After this verse was announced, Muhammad proceeded to reject the existing Arabian norms. Thereafter the legal status of adoption was not recognised under Islam. Zayd reverted to being known by his original name of &quot;Zayd ibn Harithah&quot; instead of &quot;Zayd ibn Muhammad&quot;.

In Pre-Islamic Era the Arabs used to consider an adopted person similarly to a blood relative as far as rights including right to inheritance and sanctities are concerned.

After marriage the sponsored children lost their inheritance rights and were known as the children of biological parents. The sponsored children after attaining puberty could not live with the sponsor family. The sponsored children were funded after puberty. The purpose was to reduce enmity of biological children towards sponsored children and to prevent mingling of a male sponsor with an adult sponsored female. 

Some Muslim historians have understood the discrepancy between Muhammad&#x27;s private thoughts and his expressed words to refer, not to a desire to marry Zaynab, but only to a prophetic foreknowledge that the marriage was going to happen.

====The wedding====
Muhammad married Zaynab as soon as her waiting-period from her divorce was complete, on 27 March 627. He went into her house when she did not expect him and without knocking. She asked him: &quot;Is it going to be like this, without any witnesses or trustee (&quot;wali&quot;) for our union?&quot; Muhammad replied: &quot;Allah is the witness and Gabriel is the trustee.&quot;

Muhammad gave Zaynab a dower of 400 &quot;dirhams&quot;. Later he held a wedding banquet for her and slaughtered a sheep. Anas ibn Malik said there were over seventy guests, and that none of Muhammad&#x27;s other wives was given such a large banquet. &lt;br&gt;

As soon as the men had departed, Muhammad announced a new &quot;ayat&quot; of the Quran.

===Life in Medina===
Aisha believed that Muhammad&#x27;s favourite wives, after herself, were Zaynab and Umm Salama. She said: &quot;Zaynab was my equal in beauty and in the Prophet&#x27;s love for her.&quot; Umm Salama said of Zaynab: &quot;The Messenger of Allah liked her and he also used to become vexed with her.&quot; On two occasions, when Muhammad divided a gift of food among all his wives, Zaynab was displeased with her portion and sent it back to him.

Several traditions indicate conflict between Zaynab and her co-wives. She used to boast to them: &quot;You were given in marriage by your families, while I was married (to the Prophet) by Allah from over seven Heavens.&quot; In one quarrel, Zaynab shouted insults at Aisha while Muhammad was present. Aisha retaliated with &quot;hot words until I made her quiet.&quot; Muhammad only commented that Aisha was &quot;really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&quot; Another time Zaynab refused to lend her spare camel to Safiyya; Muhammad was so angry that he did not speak to Zaynab for over two months. Aisha related that the wives were divided into two factions, one led by herself and the other by Umm Salama. Zaynab was allied to Umm Salama, together with Umm Habiba, Juwayriyya and Maymunah.

Yet it was Zaynab who defended Aisha when the latter was accused of adultery. Muhammad asked her if she knew anything about it, and Zaynab replied: &quot;O Allah&#x27;s Messenger! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.&quot; Aisha conceded: &quot;I have never seen a woman more advanced in religious piety than Zaynab, more God-conscious, more truthful, more alive to the ties of blood, more generous and having more sense of self-sacrifice in practical life and having more charitable disposition and thus more close to God, the Exalted, than she was.&quot;

Zaynab had a reputation for being prayerful. She prayed so much by night that she hung a rope between two pillars in the mosque and held onto it when she became too tired to stand. When Muhammad discovered the rope, he removed it and told her that when she became tired, she should stop praying and sit down.

==Later life==
After Muhammad’s death, Zaynab never left Medina again. She was a widow for nine years, during which time she narrated eleven &quot;ahadith&quot;.

She continued to work at tanning and leather-crafts, and she gave away all her profits in charity. Even when Caliph Umar sent her the pension of 12,000 &quot;dirhams&quot; that he allowed to all of Muhammad&#x27;s widows, Zaynab gave it all away to various poor families in Medina. At her death, her heirs did not find a single coin in her house.

==Death==
Zaynab died during the caliphate of Umar in 20 AH, in the summer of 640 or 641 CE, being the first of Muhammad&#x27;s widows to die after him. She was 53 (lunar) years old.

<doc id="1072980" wikidata="Q437490" url="?curid=1072980" title="Barbara La Marr">
<text>Barbara La Marr (born Reatha Dale Watson; July 28, 1896 – January 30, 1926) was an American film actress and screenwriter who appeared in twenty-seven films during her career between 1920 and 1926. La Marr was also noted by the media for her beauty, dubbed as the &quot;Girl Who Is Too Beautiful&quot;, as well as her tumultuous personal life.

Born in Yakima, Washington, La Marr spent her early life in the Pacific Northwest before relocating with her family to California when she was a teenager. After performing in vaudeville and working as a dancer in New York City, she moved to Los Angeles with her second husband and became a screenwriter for Fox Film Corporation, writing several successful films for the company. La Marr was finally &quot;discovered&quot; by Douglas Fairbanks, who gave her a prominent role in &quot;The Nut&quot; (1921), then cast her as Milady de Winter in his production of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1921). After two further career-boosting films with director Rex Ingram (&quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; and &quot;Trifling Women&quot;, both with Ramon Novarro), La Marr signed with Arthur H. Sawyer to make several films for various studios, including &quot;The Hero&quot; (1923), &quot;Souls for Sale&quot; (1923), and &quot;The Shooting of Dan McGrew&quot; (1924), the first and last of which she co-wrote.

During her career, La Marr became known as the pre-eminent vamp of the 1920s; she partied and drank heavily, once remarking to the press that she only slept two hours a night. In 1924, La Marr&#x27;s health began to falter after a series of crash diets for comeback roles further affected her, leading to her death from pulmonary tuberculosis and nephritis at age 29. She was posthumously honored on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the film industry.

==Early life==
Barbara La Marr was born in 1896 as Reatha Dale Watson to William and Rosana &quot;Rose&quot; Watson in Yakima, Washington (La Marr later claimed she was born in Richmond, Virginia). Her father was an editor for a newspaper and her mother, a native of Corvallis, Oregon, already had one son, Henry, and a daughter, Violet, from a previous marriage. La Marr&#x27;s parents had wed some time during 1884, and had a son, William Watson, Jr., born in June 1886, ten years before she was born. Through her mother, La Marr was of German and English descent.

In the 1920s, the elder Watson became a vaudeville comedian under the stage name of Billy Devore. The Watsons lived in various locations in Washington and Oregon during La Marr&#x27;s formative years. By 1900, she was living with her parents in Portland, Oregon, with her brother William, her half-sister Violet Ross, and Violet&#x27;s husband Arvel Ross. As a child, La Marr also performed as a dancer in vaudeville, and made her acting debut as Little Eva in a Tacoma stage production of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; in 1904.

By 1910, La Marr was living in Fresno, California, with her parents. Some time after 1911, the family moved to Los Angeles, and La Marr worked at a department store. La Marr also appeared in burlesque shows. In January 1913, her half-sister, now going by the name of Violet Ake, took her 16-year-old sister on a three-day automobile excursion with a man named C.C. Boxley. They drove up to Santa Barbara, but after a few days, La Marr felt that they were not going to let her return home. Ake and Boxley finally let La Marr return to Los Angeles after they realized that warrants were issued for their arrests, accusing them of kidnapping. This episode was published in several newspapers, and La Marr even testified against her sister, but the case eventually was dropped. La Marr&#x27;s name appeared frequently in newspaper headlines during the next few years. In November 1914, she came back to California from Arizona and announced that she was the newly widowed wife of a rancher named Jack Lytell and that they were supposedly married in Mexico. She also stated that she loathed the name Reatha and preferred to be called by the childhood nickname &quot;Beth&quot;.

== Career ==
===Early years and screenwriting===
After marrying and moving in with her third husband, vaudevillian Ben Deely, La Marr, who at one time had aspirations of being a poet, found employment writing screenplays at Fox Film Corporation using the name Folly Lyell. She wrote numerous scenarios for studio shorts at Fox and United Artists, many of which she based on her life, earning over US$10,000 during her tenure at the studios. She was credited as writer Barbara La Marr Deely on the films &quot;The Mother of His Children&quot;, &quot;The Rose of Nome&quot;, &quot;Flame of Youth&quot;, &quot;The Little Grey Mouse&quot;, and &quot;The Land of Jazz&quot; (all released in 1920).

La Marr continued to write short screenplays for the studio and supported herself by dancing in various cities across the country, including New York City, Chicago, New Orleans, and at the 1915 World&#x27;s Fair in San Francisco. La Marr&#x27;s dance partners included Rudolph Valentino and Clifton Webb, and her dance routines attracted the attention of publisher William Randolph Hearst, who featured her and a dance partner in a series of articles published in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; around 1914.

===Move to Hollywood and acting===

While working in the writers&#x27; building at United Artists, La Marr was approached by Mary Pickford, who reportedly embraced her and said, &quot;My dear, you are too beautiful to be behind a camera. Your vibrant magnetism should be shared by film audiences.&quot; La Marr&#x27;s association with filmmakers led to her returning to Los Angeles and making her film debut in 1920 in &quot;Harriet and the Piper&quot;. Though a supporting part, the film garnered her attention from audiences. La Marr made the successful transition from writer to actress with her supporting role in &quot;The Nut&quot; (1921), playing a femme fatale. Later the same year, she was hired by Douglas Fairbanks to play the substantial part of Milady de Winter in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. 
Over the next several years, La Marr acted frequently in films, and became known to the public as &quot;The Girl Who Is Too Beautiful&quot;, after Adela Rogers St. Johns, a Hearst newspaper feature writer, saw a judge sending her home during a police beat in Los Angeles because she was &quot;too beautiful and young to be on her own in the big city.&quot; This publicity did much to promote her career. Among La Marr&#x27;s films are &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; and &quot;Trifling Women&quot;, both 1922 releases directed by Rex Ingram. Although her film career flourished, she embraced the fast-paced Hollywood nightlife, remarking in an interview that she slept no more than two hours a night.

In 1923, La Marr appeared in the comedy &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot;, portraying the role of the Queen, and &quot;Poor Men&#x27;s Wives&quot;. She had a supporting part in the Fred Niblo-directed comedy &quot;Strangers of the Night&quot;, and was noted in a &quot;New York Times&quot; review for her &quot;capable&quot; performance. She starred in the lead role, with Bert Lytell and Lionel Barrymore, in &quot;The Eternal City&quot; (1923), which featured a cameo appearance by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.

===Decline and career resurgence===
In 1924, during the filming of &quot;Thy Name Is Woman&quot;, production supervisor Irving Thalberg made regular visits to the set to ensure that La Marr&#x27;s alcoholism was not interfering with the shoot. The same year, La Marr&#x27;s first starring, above-the-title role came in the drama &quot;Sandra&quot;, from First National Pictures, which she filmed in New York City in August 1924. La Marr had served as a co-writer on the film, which focused on a woman suffering from a split-personality disorder. Upon release, the film received dismally negative reviews.

La Marr&#x27;s final screenplay, titled &quot;My Husband&#x27;s Wives&quot;, was produced by Fox in 1924, arriving in theaters shortly after the release of &quot;Sandra&quot;, and before the production of what proved to be her final three films: &quot;The Heart of a Siren&quot; (a mixed reception), &quot;The White Monkey&quot; (a critical failure), and &quot;The Girl from Montmartre&quot; (a critical success, albeit posthumously released). While shooting &quot;The Girl from Montmartre&quot; in early October 1925, La Marr collapsed on set and went into a coma as the studio wrapped production without her with use of a double in long shots.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and marriages===

Although the tally is usually given as five, La Marr officially was married only four times. No documentation exists to prove the existence of her alleged first husband, Jack Lytelle, whom she claimed to have met while visiting friends in Yuma, Arizona in 1914. According to La Marr, Lytelle became enamored with her as he saw her one day riding in an automobile while he was on horseback. The couple allegedly married the day after they met, but Lytelle, it was claimed, died of pneumonia only three weeks into the marriage, leaving only a surname for Mrs. Lytelle to inherit.

La Marr&#x27;s first official documented marriage on June 2, 1914, was to a Max Lawrence, who later turned out to be a former soldier of fortune named Lawrence Converse. He already was married with children when he married La Marr under a false name, and was arrested for bigamy the following day. Converse died of a blood clot in his brain, allegedly caused by banging his head against the cell bars while calling for La Marr, three days later on June 5.

On October 13, 1916, La Marr married Philip Ainsworth, a noted dancer. Although the son of well-off parents, Ainsworth eventually was incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison for passing bad checks, and the couple divorced in 1917. She married for a third time to Ben Deely, also a dancer, in 1918. Deely, who was over twice her age, was an alcoholic and a gambling addict, which led to the couple&#x27;s separation in April 1921. Before the divorce from Deely was finalized, La Marr married actor Jack Dougherty in May 1923. Despite separating a year later, they remained legally married until her death.

Some years after La Marr&#x27;s death, she was revealed to have given birth to a son, Marvin Carville La Marr, on July 29, 1922. The name of the boy&#x27;s father has never been released. During her final illness, La Marr entrusted the care of her son to her close friend, actress ZaSu Pitts, and Pitts&#x27; husband, film executive Tom Gallery. After La Marr&#x27;s death, the child was legally adopted by Pitts and Gallery; renamed Donald Michael &quot;Sonny&quot; Gallery. Don Gallery was married to actress Joyce Reynolds from 1947 to 1951 before remarrying Patricia in 1985. He lived in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and died in 2014 at the age of 92.

===Health problems===

La Marr partied long hours and got very little sleep during the latter part of her career, often pairing this behavior with drinking during especially low points; she once told an interviewer: &quot;I cheat nature. I never sleep more than two hours a day. I have better things to do.&quot; In addition to her drinking and lack of sleep, during the last two years of her life La Marr went on several extreme crash diets to lose weight. La Marr was rumored to have at one time ingested a tapeworm head in a pill to help her lose weight.

By late 1925, La Marr&#x27;s health had deteriorated significantly due to pulmonary tuberculosis. While filming her final feature, &quot;The Girl from Montmartre&quot;, La Marr collapsed on the set and lapsed into a coma. In mid-December, she was diagnosed with nephritis, an inflammation of the kidneys, as a complication of her already tubercular state. La Marr was bedridden through Christmas, and by late December, she reportedly weighed less than .

Some historians and writers have claimed that La Marr was addicted to morphine and heroin, which she had been prescribed after injuring her ankle and which may have contributed to her health problems. In Sherri Snyder&#x27;s 2017 biography of La Marr, the writer states that these claims were untrue and erroneously reported. A frequently recirculated rumor was that La Marr was arrested for morphine possession in Los Angeles; however, Snyder states that this claim was mistakenly attributed to La Marr, when it had in fact been actress Alma Rubens who had been arrested in January 1931, five years after La Marr&#x27;s death. Ben Finney, a close friend of La Marr, contested the claims of drug use, stating: &quot;It is inconceivable that during our close friendship I would not have known if she were a junkie,&quot; adding, &quot;She did well enough with booze.&quot;

==Death==
On January 30, 1926, La Marr died of complications associated with tuberculosis and nephritis at her parents&#x27; home in Altadena, California, at the age of 29. Her friend, film director Paul Bern, was with her when she died. La Marr&#x27;s son later speculated that Bern may have been his biological father, though this eventually was disproved; Bern died in a mysterious shooting six years later.

La Marr&#x27;s funeral at the Walter C. Blue Undertaking Chapel in Los Angeles attracted over 3,000 fans, and five women reportedly fainted in the crowd and had to be removed by police to safety. After her removal from the church during the funeral procession, hundreds of fans flooded the chapel hoping to obtain flowers from the decorative arrangements. She was interred in a crypt at Hollywood Cathedral Mausoleum, in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. In February 1960, the Hollywood Walk of Fame recognized her contribution to the motion picture industry, with a star at 1621 Vine Street.

==In popular culture==
Producer Louis B. Mayer persuaded actress Hedwig Kiesler to adopt the stage name Hedy Lamarr on behalf of his wife, a longtime admirer of La Marr. She is also referred to in the popular 1932 Flanagan and Allen song &quot;Underneath the Arches&quot; during a break in which Ches Allen reads the headlines from a 1926 newspaper. Children&#x27;s author Edward Eager set an episode of his 1954 book &quot;Half Magic&quot; at a showing of La Marr&#x27;s &quot;Sandra&quot; and includes ironic descriptions of the movie.

<text>White Horse Hill National Game Preserve (Dakota: , formerly known as Sullys Hill National Game Preserve) is a National Wildlife Refuge and nature center located on the shore of Devils Lake in Benson County, North Dakota, within the Spirit Lake Tribe reservation.

==History ==
In 1904, Congress authorized a memorial park at the site, and President Theodore Roosevelt established it as Sullys Hill Park. Though not part of its official name, it would be called Sullys Hill National Park, the meaning of &quot;national park&quot; not yet standardized, as this site&#x27;s small size and lack of a significant landmark was inconsistent with other national parks. It was first named after General Alfred Sully, son of the painter Thomas Sully who gained his reputation by carrying out several massacres of Dakota including at the Battle of Whitestone Hill.

On March 3, 1931, during the Great Depression, the United States Congress transferred the park to be managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service as a wildlife refuge, where hunting is permitted with the Spirit Lake Tribe having both fishing and hunting rights. It is one of only seven National Parks to have been disbanded. Of these seven parks, only White Horse Hill and Mackinac National Park in Michigan, now Mackinac Island State Park, are no longer under the control of the National Park Service.

In December 2019, the park was renamed through an act of Congress to its traditional Dakota name of White Horse Hill. In May 2019, the Spirit Lake Tribal council had requested the federal government change the name to White Horse Hill in cooperation with the governor&#x27;s office and the North Dakota Department of Tourism stating, &quot;The Spirit Lake Dakota people... believe the name chosen, White Horse Hill, comes from historical happenings that are sacred as well as unique to the Dakota people. White Horse Hill (Sunka Wakan Ska Pa Ha) reflects a positive experience to the Dakota People rather than an individual who was destructive to the Dakota people and their culture&quot;.

==Recreation and natural resources==
 The park&#x27;s 1,674 acres (6.8 km2), a mixture of mixed grass prairie, marshes and wooded hills, includes wildlife as 20-30 American bison, 25-40 elk, 20-30 white-tailed deer, and a colony of prairie dogs. An array of birds, insects, and plants have also been identified within the refuge. Open seasonally, the visitor center includes an exhibit hall of mounted North Dakota animals in prairie, wetland, forest, and agriculture habitats, education classrooms, and a book store. The center offer programs for school groups, public workshops, guided nature hikes, bird-watching walks, summer youth programs, and conservation programs throughout the year.

<doc id="1072985" wikidata="Q7381499" url="?curid=1072985" title="Russell Fairbrother">
<text>Elwin Russell Fairbrother is a lawyer and former New Zealand politician. He was a Labour Party Member of Parliament from 2002 to 2008.

==Early years==
Fairbrother, who is commonly known by his middle name, was born into a truck driving family and raised in the Wairarapa town of Carterton.

Before entering politics, Fairbrother was a lawyer for twenty-three years, having obtained an LLB from Victoria University of Wellington. At Victoria, he was a member of the Victoria University of Wellington Debating Society. In 1969 he won the Plunket Medal for Oratory and in 1971 he won the Joynt Scroll for inter university debating. He debated for NZ Universities against a touring Australian University team. He served as president of the Wellington Speaking Union.

He was also president of the Napier branch of Grey Power, a lobby group for the elderly and a past president and then patron of HB Prisoners Aid and Rehabilitation Society.

As a lawyer, he has led the defence in over 100 murder trials and has appeared before the Privy Council in London. In 1994 he successfully defended a murder accused in what has come to be regarded as the world&#x27;s first Post Traumatic Stress Disorder defence; this case has since formed the basis of a novel by celebrated author Sir James McNeish – &quot;The Crime of Huey Dunstan&quot; published in 2010.

==Member of Parliament==


Fairbrother was first elected to Parliament in the 2002 election, replacing long-serving Labour MP Geoff Braybrooke in the Napier seat. In the 2005 general election he was defeated by National&#x27;s Chris Tremain but was elected as a list MP.

In his first term he was elected chair of the special select committee of the House of Parliament created to examine and report on the Maori Fisheries Act 2004, the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 and the Guardians of Fiordland legislation. He was also one of three government appointments to the special select committee set up to report to Parliament on New Zealand&#x27;s constitutional arrangements. He was also elected chair of the Labour back bench committee and appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Attorney General.

In his second term he was elected chair of the special sub-committee established to examine and report on the Evidence Act 2006. He was selected by the Prime Minister to travel to and observe East Timor&#x27;s first domestic democratic election.

After defeating Stuart Nash in a battle to stand in the Napier electorate for Labour, Fairbrother did not stand on Labour&#x27;s list in the 2008 election. He was unable to win the electorate off Chris Tremain in the 2008 election and, since he was not successful in regaining his seat, he was not returned to parliament.

==After politics==
After leaving Parliament, Fairbrother returned to the law. Including acting for Chris Comesky. He successfully secured acquittals in the high-profile murder cases of Zion King, and Wilson Apatu, who had shot a man four times in front of his family, killing him, before carjacking a couple at knifepoint. He was the defence lawyer for ex-Dunedin dean Jonathan Kirkpatrick after his NZ$600,000 fraud at the Auckland University of Technology.

Sebald was born in Wertach, Bavaria, the second of the three children of Rosa and Georg Sebald, and his parents&#x27; only son. From 1948 to 1963, he lived in Sonthofen. His father had joined the Reichswehr in 1929 and served in the Wehrmacht under the Nazis. His father remained a detached figure, a prisoner of war until 1947; his maternal grandfather, the small-town police officer Josef Egelhofer (1872–1956), was the most important male presence during his early years. Sebald was shown images of the Holocaust while at school in Oberstdorf and recalled that no one knew how to explain what they had just seen. The Holocaust and European modernity, especially its modes of warfare and persecution, later became central themes in his work.

Sebald studied German and English literature first at the University of Freiburg and then at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, where he received a degree in 1965. He was a lector at the University of Manchester from 1966 to 1969. He returned to St. Gallen in Switzerland for a year, hoping to work as a teacher, but could not settle. Sebald married his Austrian-born wife, Ute, in 1967. In 1970 he became a lecturer at the University of East Anglia (UEA). There, he completed his PhD in 1973 with a dissertation entitled &quot;The Revival of Myth: A Study of Alfred Döblin&#x27;s Novels&quot;. Sebald acquired habilitation from the University of Hamburg in 1986. In 1987, he was appointed to a chair of European literature at UEA. In 1989 he became the founding director of the British Centre for Literary Translation. He lived at Wymondham and Poringland while at UEA.

==Final year==
The 2001 publication of &quot;Austerlitz&quot; (both in German and English) secured Sebald worldwide fame: &quot;&quot;Austerlitz&quot; was received enthusiastically on an international scale; literary critics celebrated it frenetically; the book established Sebald as a modern classic.&quot; He was tipped as a possible future winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. With grown and still growing reputation, he was now in high demand by literary institutions and radio programmes throughout Western Europe. Newspapers, magazines and journals from Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and the U.S. urged him for interviews. &quot;Condemned to unrest I am, I am afraid&quot;, he wrote to Andreas Dorschel in June 2001, returning from one trip and setting out for the next.

For a considerable time, Sebald had been aware of a congenital cardiac insufficiency; to a visitor from the US, he described himself in August 2001 as &quot;someone who knows he has to leave before too long&quot;. Sebald died while driving near Norwich in December 2001. The event threw the literary public into a state of shock. Sebald had been driving with his daughter Anna, who survived the crash. The coroner&#x27;s report, released some six months after the accident, stated that Sebald had suffered a heart attack and had died of this condition before his car swerved across the road and collided with an oncoming lorry.

W.G. Sebald is buried in St. Andrew&#x27;s churchyard in Framingham Earl, close to where he lived.

==Themes and style==
Sebald&#x27;s works are largely concerned with the themes of memory and loss of memory (both personal and collective) and decay (of civilizations, traditions or physical objects). They are, in particular, attempts to reconcile himself with, and deal in literary terms with, the trauma of the Second World War and its effect on the German people. In &quot;On the Natural History of Destruction&quot; (1999), he wrote an essay on the wartime bombing of German cities and the absence in German writing of any real response. His concern with The Holocaust is expressed in several books delicately tracing his own biographical connections with Jews. Contrary to Germany&#x27;s political and intellectual establishment, Sebald denied the singularity of the Holocaust: &quot;I see the catastrophe caused by the Germans, dreadful as it was, by no means as a singular event – it developed with a certain logic from European history and then, for the same reason, ate itself into European history.&quot; Consequently, Sebald, in his literary work, always tried to situate and contextualize the Holocaust within modern European history, even avoiding a focus on Germany.

Sebald completely rejected the mainstream of Western German literature of the 1950s to 1970s, as represented by Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass: &quot;I hate [...] the German postwar novel like pestilence.&quot; He took a deliberate counter-stance. Sebald&#x27;s distinctive and innovative novels (which he mostly called simply: prose (&quot;Prosa&quot;)) were written in an intentionally somewhat old-fashioned and elaborate German (one passage in &quot;Austerlitz&quot; famously contains a sentence that is 9 pages long). Sebald closely supervised the English translations (principally by Anthea Bell and Michael Hulse). They include &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;The Emigrants&quot;, &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; and &quot;Austerlitz&quot;. They are notable for their curious and wide-ranging mixture of fact (or apparent fact), recollection and fiction, often punctuated by indistinct black-and-white photographs set in evocative counterpoint to the narrative rather than illustrating it directly. His novels are presented as observations and recollections made while travelling around Europe. They also have a dry and mischievous sense of humour.

Sebald was also the author of three books of poetry: &quot;For Years Now&quot; with Tess Jaray (2001), &quot;After Nature&quot; (1988), and &quot;Unrecounted&quot; (2004).

==Influences==
The works of Jorge Luis Borges, especially &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; and &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;, were a major influence on Sebald. (Tlön and Uqbar appear in &quot;The Rings of Saturn.&quot;) In a conversation during his final year, Sebald named Gottfried Keller, Adalbert Stifter, Heinrich von Kleist and Jean Paul as his literary models. He also credited the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard as a major influence on his work, and paid homage within his work to Kafka and Nabokov (the figure of Nabokov appears in every one of the four sections of &quot;The Emigrants&quot;).

== Memorials ==
=== Sebaldweg (&quot;Sebald Way&quot;) ===
As a memorial to the writer, in 2005 the town of Wertach created an eleven kilometre long walkway called the It runs from the border post at Oberjoch (1,159m) to W. G. Sebald&#x27;s birthplace on Grüntenseestrasse 3 in Wertach (915m). The route is that taken by the narrator in &quot;Il ritorno in patria&quot;, the final section of &quot;Vertigo&quot; (&quot;Schwindel. Gefühle&quot;) by W. G. Sebald. Six steles have been erected along the way with texts from the book relating to the respective topographical place, and also with reference to fire and to people who died in the Second World War, two of Sebald&#x27;s main themes.

=== Sebald Copse ===
In the grounds of the University of East Anglia in Norwich a round wooden bench encircles a copper beech tree, planted in 2003 by the family of W. G. Sebald in memory of the writer. Together with other trees donated by former students of the writer, the area is called the &quot;Sebald Copse&quot;. The bench, whose form echoes &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot;, carries an inscription from the penultimate poem of &quot;Unerzählt&quot; (&quot;Unrecounted&quot;): &quot;Unerzählt bleibt die Geschichte der abgewandten Gesichter&quot; (&quot;Unrecounted always it will remain the story of the averted faces&quot;)

=== &quot;Patience (After Sebald)&quot; ===

In 2011, Grant Gee made the documentary &quot;Patience (After Sebald)&quot; about the author&#x27;s trek through the East Anglian landscape.

<text>Jesse is an American sitcom television series created by Ira Ungerleider and starring Christina Applegate, that ran on NBC from September 24, 1998, to May 25, 2000, for two seasons of a total 42 episodes.

The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television.

==Synopsis==
The show stars Christina Applegate as single mother Jesse Warner, raising her twelve-year-old son, Little John, in Buffalo, New York. She works for her overbearing father in a German-themed bar, serving beer while wearing a dirndl. Jesse&#x27;s love interest, a Chilean named Diego (Bruno Campos), gains a rival when her ex-husband comes to town, intent on winning her back.

In the second season, Jesse becomes a nurse and stories revolve around her friends instead of her family.

<doc id="1072998" wikidata="Q7203433" url="?curid=1072998" title="Playing time (cricket)">
<text>Games in the sport of cricket are played over a number of hours or days, making it one of the sports with the longest playing time, though sailing, yachting, road cycling, and rallying are sometimes longer. Typically, Test and first-class cricket matches are played over three to five days with, at least, six hours of cricket being played each day. Limited overs formats of cricket take place in one day, with List A matches lasting for six hours or more, and T20, 100-ball and T10 matches lasting from 90 minutes to three hours. These variations in length of playing time occur because different formats of cricket have different caps on the number of legal deliveries or days that the innings or overall game can go, with games otherwise theoretically having no limit as to how long they can go. Cricket therefore has special rules about intervals for lunch, tea and drinks as well as rules about when play starts and ends. These rules are outlined in Laws 11 (Intervals) and 12 (Start of play; cessation of play) in the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;.

==When the game is played==

The game is only played in dry weather. Additionally, as it is not unusual for balls to be bowled at over in first-class cricket, the game needs to be played in enough light for a batsman to be able to see the ball. Play is therefore halted when it rains (but not usually when it drizzles) and when there is bad light. Some one-day games and Test matches are now played under floodlights. The first day/night Test match was played between Australia and New Zealand in Adelaide, in November 2015, and was deemed a success, leading to further day/night Tests being scheduled. Day/night Test cricket is played with a pink ball as opposed to the traditional red ball to aid visibility. Apart from some experimental One Day International series in Australia&#x27;s roofed Marvel Stadium, cricket is played outdoors.

These requirements mean that in England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe the game is played in the summer.

In the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh games are played in the winter. In these countries the hurricane and typhoon season coincides with their summers. This has another effect. Games start earlier in these places than in the countries which play cricket as a summer sport. In these countries games start at around 09:30 rather than the 10:30 or 11:00 start time used in England, say, so that play for the day is complete before dusk, which may be as early as 17:30.

==Starting and finishing play==
A game or day starts when the umpire at the bowler&#x27;s end calls &#x27;Play&#x27;. &#x27;Play&#x27; is also called to restart the game after an interval or interruption. Before an interval in or interruption of play, and at the end of a match, the umpire at the bowler&#x27;s end calls &#x27;Time&#x27; and removes the bails from both of the wickets. The bowling side cannot make an appeal for a dismissal after &#x27;Time&#x27; has been called.

The game finishes when the first of three things happens:

#There is a result, so that one of the teams has won or the team batting last has lost all its wickets with both teams having the same score thereby giving a tie;
#The later of the minimum number of overs for the last hour are completed and the agreed time for the end of the game has been reached (see notes below);
#If the players leave the field, either for adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, and no further play is possible.

Notes:

#In one-day cricket the second of these is replaced by the requirement that the agreed number of overs has been reached.
#The term &quot;last hour&quot; can be a misnomer. One hour before the scheduled end of the game, the last hour starts. An agreed minimum number of overs (usually 15 in Test match cricket and 20 in other first-class cricket games) is bowled. The last hour therefore lasts either for the longer of 60 minutes, or the time it takes to bowl the agreed minimum number of overs. This rule is there to prevent time wasting by a team that looks likely to lose a game.
# Today, Test matches are played under a set of conditions agreed by the boards of the competing countries. These are highly standardised. Days are scheduled as six hours of playing time, but there is a requirement that a minimum of 90 six-ball overs are bowled, and the third session may run overtime if the over rate has been slower than this. If there is a change of innings, two overs are deducted from the requirement.
# If there are interruptions to play due to weather or bad light, the scheduled stumps time may be extended by up to one hour to compensate (light permitting). If more than an hour&#x27;s play is lost, time may be added on subsequent days.

==Intervals==

Because of the length of the game, there are a number of intervals that occur in a game of cricket. These are:

* The period between close of play on one day and the start of the next day&#x27;s play.
* Intervals between innings.
* Intervals for meals (lunch/dinner and tea).
* Intervals for drinks.

There are special rules setting out the duration of each interval. The interval between innings lasts for 10 minutes. In Test cricket, lunch (or, in the case of day/night Test matches, dinner) will last for 40 minutes and tea for 20 minutes.

Before the coin toss to determine which side bats first, the hours of play, including the timing and duration of intervals for meals or any non-standard interval, are agreed. However, if nine wickets are down when the agreed time for lunch or tea is reached (so that the bowling team only needs one more wicket to end the batting team&#x27;s innings), that interval may be delayed until the end of the innings, with a maximum delay of 30 minutes. In a one-day game the teams may agree to take the interval for tea between innings rather than have a separate interval. Also, the teams and umpires sometimes agree to have other intervals. This may be to allow the teams to be presented to an important visitor or to allow time for a presentation or acclamation when a player breaks a significant record. Other intervals may be varied slightly if a wicket falls shortly before the interval is scheduled to be taken.

Drinks intervals are agreed at the start of each day, but are not taken during the last hour of the match. Drinks intervals are particularly important when the game is played in hot climates. Games being played in heat of and above are not unknown. According to Law 11.8, a drinks interval &quot;shall be kept as short as possible and in any case shall not exceed 5 minutes&quot;.

== Pace-of-play regulations ==
=== International cricket rules ===
In international limited-overs cricket, there is a time limit of 60 seconds between overs, and a 5-run penalty is awarded to the batting team if the fielding team fails to begin bowling the next over by the end of the 60 seconds. However, the first two breaches of this rule by the fielding team result only in a warning.

==Notable games==

A number of games are notable for either their length or because they were played through adverse conditions that would usually see the game called off.

===The longest Test===
Test match cricket is international cricket played over three or more days. Nowadays all men&#x27;s Test matches are scheduled over five days. In the past some Tests were &#x27;timeless&#x27;, that is, they were scheduled to be played to their conclusion regardless of how long that took. The longest Test on record was between South Africa and England in Durban, South Africa. The game started on 3 March 1939 and play continued on the 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 13th and the 14th. Play was scheduled for the 11th, but none was possible because of rain, giving 9 days of actual play and 10 days of scheduled play. By the evening of 14 March England were 316 &amp; 654–5 chasing South Africa&#x27;s 530 &amp; 481, needing just 42 more runs for victory. However, England needed to leave Durban the following day to catch their boat home, so, despite being a &#x27;timeless&#x27; Test, a draw was agreed. England&#x27;s 654 is the highest ever Test cricket score for teams batting last (beating the next highest by more than 200 runs).

<doc id="1073001" wikidata="Q7676492" url="?curid=1073001" title="Taito Phillip Field">
<text>Taito Phillip Hans Field (26 September 1952 – 23 September 2021) was a Samoan-born New Zealand trade unionist and politician. A Member of Parliament (MP) for South Auckland electorates from 1993 to 2008, Field was the first New Zealand MP of Pasifika descent. He was a minister outside Cabinet in a Labour-led government from 2003 to 2005.

Following charges of bribery and perverting the course of justice, Field was defeated in the 2008 New Zealand general election. He was found guilty on some of the charges in August 2009 and was sentenced to six years jail in October 2009.

==Early life==

Born in Apia, the capital of what was then the Territory of Western Samoa, he gained the name of &quot;Taito&quot;, the &quot;matai&quot; (paramount chief) title of the village of Manase on Savai&#x27;i, Samoa, in 1975. He was of Samoan, Cook Island, German, English, and Jewish ancestry. He was a pioneering figure for Pasifika New Zealanders while in the Labour Party.

He worked for the New Zealand Treasury in the 1970s and then as a union official for the Hotel, Hospital &amp; Restaurant Union and the Service Workers Union (now E tū).

In 1990 he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

==Member of Parliament==




Field first became a Member of Parliament when elected by the South Auckland seat of Otara in the 1993 election. He had stood for Otara in 1990 to replace Colin Moyle who was retiring, but with the swing against Labour in 1990 he was defeated by Trevor Rogers of the National Party.

Field delivered his maiden statement on 10 March 1994. He commented on his status as the first New Zealand MP of Pasifika descent elected to Parliament: &quot;I have been attributed as being the first Pacific Island member of Parliament in New Zealand. I take pride in that status but feel humbled by the responsibility that it carries. As a passing thought, I have wondered about the accuracy of this tribute. The islands of Aotearoa are islands in the Pacific Ocean, notwithstanding those parts in the Tasman Sea. So in a sense, all New Zealanders are Pacific Islanders.&quot;

In 1996 he was elected as MP for Mangere, succeeding David Lange. He was appointed parliamentary under-secretary for Pacific island affairs, social services and justice in 2002. He held the position of Minister outside Cabinet, with the portfolios of Associate Minister for Pacific Island Affairs, Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment, and Associate Minister for Justice, from 2003 until he was stood down in 2005.

In the September 2005 general election, Field won a majority of more than 16,000 over his nearest opponent, Clem Simich of the National Party. This was the largest majority in any electorate seat in New Zealand.

=== 2004 Israel–New Zealand passport scandal ===

An incident of passport fraud carried out by alleged Mossad agents in July 2004 led New Zealand to take diplomatic sanctions against Israel. High-level contacts between the two countries were suspended including the cancellation by New Zealand of a planned visit by Israeli President Moshe Katzav and approval for a new Israeli ambassador to New Zealand was delayed. &quot;Australian Jewish News&quot; credited Field with acting as a bridge between the two governments when he visited Nissan Krupsky, the former Israeli ambassador to New Zealand, in Israel in December. AJN reported that Field met with Israel&#x27;s Foreign Ministry officials secretly because of the NZ ban on meetings between the government&#x27;s officials. New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff denied Field played any significant role in overcoming the diplomatic impasse on 1 July. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a high-level visit. What he was doing was in a private capacity to see people he knew in Israel and I didn&#x27;t raise any objection to him going.&quot; According to AJN, &quot;While Field&#x27;s visit eventually turned out to have critical diplomatic significance, it was described as private so as not to be seen as violating the sanctions imposed by Clark. Nonetheless, throughout his visit Field served as middleman between the two Governments, maintaining phone contacts with Wellington in order to secure Clark&#x27;s approval for the start of the Ankara talks.&quot; Goff denied that the talks between Israel&#x27;s FM official Michael Ronen and Ambassador Henderson were a direct result of Field&#x27;s visit.

===Conflict of interest allegations===

In October 2005, Field lost his ministerial posts following controversies around allegations that he had improperly used his influence as an MP to receive material gain. In particular, it was alleged that he had used his position as a Member of Parliament to obtain a work permit for a non-resident who had worked as a tiler at reduced hourly rates on his home in Samoa. It was also alleged that Field had used his position to obtain a discounted price for a property deal he had constructed with low-income welfare beneficiaries in his electorate. An inquiry cleared him of any conflict of interest, but did criticise his judgement over the events.

Further allegations of improper behaviour were made by the Television New Zealand &quot;Sunday&quot; programme on 27 August 2006, which led to Prime Minister Helen Clark saying that Field should reconsider his future as an MP. Police launched an investigation the following day into claims that Field had benefited from helping people with immigration applications. Field was put on indefinite paid leave from Parliament by the Labour Party. After Field made comments to the media that he might run against the Labour Party in a future election, steps were taken on 13 February 2007 by Labour to expel Field from the party.

===Independent===

On 14 February 2007, Field was formally expelled from the parliamentary caucus of the Labour Party. This was announced by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Margaret Wilson. To forestall moves to expel him from the Labour Party altogether, Field resigned on 16 February 2007, returning to Parliament as an independent, but promising to support the Government&#x27;s legislative programme. However, on 21 February, he voted against the Labour Party on Green MP Sue Bradford&#x27;s Members&#x27; Bill to amend Section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961 (see Child Discipline Act 2007).

===New political party===

In April 2007 Field told &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot; he would form a new political party based on family values. Field cited opposition to Sue Bradford&#x27;s Bill to remove the defence for child discipline as an example of a &quot;groundswell of Christian people&quot; and stated &quot;There is a vacuum, there is room for a political party... people are looking for a new vehicle.&quot; Field also had meetings with Richard Lewis, leader of Destiny Church political party Destiny New Zealand, over a possible alliance. In January 2008, Field moved to register the New Zealand Pacific Party.

In the 2008 New Zealand general election, Field lost his seat to incoming new Labour MP William Sio by 7126 votes. The New Zealand Pacific Party won 0.37% of party votes cast, well below the 5% threshold needed to gain list representation, so won no seats in Parliament.

==Corruption charges==

On 24 May 2007, police announced that they would seek the leave of the High Court to lay corruption charges against Field (a necessary procedural step when such charges are laid in New Zealand). The offence, corruption and bribery of a member of Parliament, carries a maximum sentence of 7 years&#x27; imprisonment. If Field was convicted while still a member, his Parliamentary seat would have been vacated.

At a press conference following the police announcement, Field asserted his innocence of the charges and expressed his intention to fight both the laying of the charges at the leave hearing, and any charges that might result from the police application. On 5 October 2007 the High Court ruled that the police could lay corruption charges against Field. The Thai tiler at the centre of the corruption allegations, Sunan Siriwan, announced he would sue Field for $200,000 compensation for the year&#x27;s work he undertook on Field&#x27;s property in Samoa.

Field appeared in court on 26 November 2007 on 15 counts of bribery and 25 of attempting to pervert the course of justice, and was released on bail without entering a plea. After a depositions hearing in mid-2008, he was remanded to the High Court for trial on 40 charges. On 20 April 2009, his trial commenced on 35 charges, 12 for corruption and bribery as a member of Parliament and 23 for wilfully perverting the course of justice. On 4 August 2009, Field was found guilty of 26 charges at the High Court in Auckland. The ten member jury found Field guilty of 11 of the 12 bribery and corruption charges, and 15 of 23 charges relating to attempting to pervert the course of justice.

On 6 October 2009, Field was jailed for six years on corruption charges, with the sentencing judge saying his offending threatened the foundation of democracy and justice. Field&#x27;s wife, Maxine Gallagher-Field, has said that her husband is &quot;treated like a chief in jail&quot; by other inmates.

The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and sentence in November 2010. An appeal began to be heard in the Supreme Court in June 2011.

He was released from prison on parole on 17 October 2011. Shortly after his release, his appeal in the Supreme Court was unanimously dismissed. The appeal revolved around a de minimis defence.

==Illegal building==

Field and the company T P Field Developments Limited (of which Field was one of two directors, and the sole shareholder) admitted illegally converting a garage into a family room and a carport into a garage at a Papatoetoe residence and were fined a total of $20,000 plus costs in 2008.

==After release==

After his release, Field worked on property development projects in New Zealand and Samoa, and started work on a biography.

Field died in Auckland on 23 September 2021, aged 68.

<text>Sandton City is a large shopping centre situated in Sandton, Gauteng, South Africa. It was built and owned by property development company Rapp and Maister, in partnership with brothers Hilliard and Eli Leibowitz, and was later taken over by Liberty Life (now part of Liberty Holdings Limited).

The centre opened to the public on 12 September 1973 and has a gross leasable area of of retail space. The office space combined with the Sandton Sun Hotel increase the total area to . Together, Sandton City and the adjacent Nelson Mandela Square (formerly Sandton Square) form one of the largest retail complexes in Africa with shops such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Patek Phillipe, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and other exclusive boutiques - sometimes referred to as &quot;the richest square mile in Africa&quot;.

==History==
Sandton City was built as a twenty-one storey, concrete block shopping centre that opened in late 1973. It is an example of the Brutalist architecture that was common in South Africa in the early 1970s. The architecture is also seen in the Golden Acre (Goue Akker), a similar shopping centre built in Cape Town before the construction of Sandton City, the International Terminal at OR Tambo International Airport, the Carlton Centre, new Rand Afrikaans University (now University of Johannesburg), and the JG Strijdom (since renamed the Hillbrow Tower) in Hillbrow, Central Johannesburg. Most of these buildings were conceived in the late 1960s.

===1960s===
In 1968, Rapp and Maister property developers purchased land consisting of 4 hectares opposite the future Sandton municipal site on the corner of 5th Street and Rivonia Road. Previously the location was the site of a stud farm. Rapp and Maister proposed to build a large shopping mall with an office tower on their site on this highpoint in Sandton. Both the proposed new town location and the shopping centre was contested by many including the Johannesburg City Council and Sandown residents which saw the proposal brought before the Townships Board for a decision. Both municipal and Rapp and Maister&#x27;s project for a R20 million, 20 storey office tower and 30,000 m2 retail space was approved. They also were allowed additional retail space up to 90,000 m2, 60,000 m2 of office space and 20,000 m2 of space for other uses.

===1970s===

Sandton City opened in 1973 with 120 stores on two levels of 50,000 m2, and added two additional levels of parking for 2,500 cars and outside parking with 25,000 m2 of office space. It was also the first of its kind in Johannesburg. Upon opening, the scale and depth of the centre revolutionised South African and Johannesburg retail. The outer plaza to the east housed offices, branches of Nedbank and Barclays (later to become First National Bank), medical suites and a steak house. A bridge connected the outer plaza to what was then Sandton Library, a medical clinic and the Sandton Council building. In its early stages in the 1970s, the small lower floor housed a post office and a Ster-Kinekor cinema complex that is still there today.

===1980s===

According to the Sandton City website, by 1983 there were 240 stores and 8,000 parking bays while the five-star towers were launched, and 44,000 m2 of space added. The 564 room Sandton Sun Hotel was built in 1984 as part of the complex.

===1990s===

During this time, Sandton City underwent major refurbishment of common areas. The area in front of the Sandton Library was developed into a new shopping centre, Sandton Square, connected by a sky-bridge. A pyramid-shaped roof was added in the 1990s and provides the distinguishing architectural feature of Sandton City.

===2000s===

In 2001, stores were increased to 295 while parking bays were boosted to 10,000. A new food court and giant video wall were also constructed. The Home Living retail level was developed in 2002, and the cinema complex received a refurbishment in the same year.
===2010s===

In 2013, the Twin Towers office section of Sandton City was completely re-clad with a contemporary glass shell (these are now called Atrium on 5th). In 2014, the office tower received a complete external revamp, with new cladding applied over the original concrete structure. A new wing was also added to the mall, joining the Edgars and Woolworths Courts. A major refurbishment of the entertainment areas and adjoining stores commenced in 2017 and will be completed in 2018.

=== 2020s ===
On 26 March 2020, the worldwide pandemic, COVID-19, forced Sandton City among other malls across Johannesburg, to shut the majority of its stores down during South Africa&#x27;s lockdown. Supermarkets, pharmacies, and other essential stores such as banks and mobile operating stores were allowed to remain open during this phase. The stores reopened after the lockdown restrictions eased.

<doc id="1073011" wikidata="Q5130043" url="?curid=1073011" title="Clay Walker (album)">
<text>Clay Walker is the debut studio album by the American country music singer Clay Walker. It was released in 1993 on Giant Records and produced by James Stroud. The album produced four singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music charts, of which three — &quot;What&#x27;s It to You&quot;, &quot;Live Until I Die&quot; and &quot;Dreaming with My Eyes Open&quot; — reached Number One. Respectively, these were the first, second, and fourth singles from the album. The third single, &quot;Where Do I Fit in the Picture&quot;, peaked at No. 11. Additionally, &quot;White Palace&quot; peaked at No. 67 based on unsolicited airplay.

==Background==
After hearing about Walker, James Stroud flew down to Beaumont, Texas, to meet him and see his show. After being &quot;completely impressed&quot;, Stroud brought Walker to Nashville to record demos and then signed him to Giant and they began work on the debut album. Stroud revealed, &quot;Clay is very consistent, and that&#x27;s pretty rare in such a young act. He&#x27;s one of those artists who, when he sings and you hear him going down on tape, you just know. I knew it with Clint [Black], and I could hear it with Clay.&quot; Walker explained the meeting in &quot;SUCCESS&quot; by saying, &quot;I finished the last song, chased Stroud to his limousine and asked him if everything was OK. He said yes and that he would see me in a couple of weeks to start recording an album.&quot;

In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Walker said, &quot;It was frustrating that I wasn&#x27;t getting a contract, but I never doubted I&#x27;d eventually get one from somebody. That&#x27;s because my father taught me something else too--to have incredible confidence in myself.&quot; Walker told &quot;Country Song Roundup&quot;, &quot;The songs that I write are normally either a true life experience, or they&#x27;re things that I&#x27;ve witnessed from other people, friends or family. When you write, you become vulnerable. If you&#x27;re gonna be true to yourself and write what you really feel, that&#x27;s what you have to do, you have to put down on paper exactly what you&#x27;re feeling... I make myself very vulnerable because I open up my thoughts and they could be criticized, which can be painful, or they can be accepted.

Walker was one of several musicians including Tracy Byrd and Mark Chesnutt who came from Beaumont, Texas when his debut album was released. He told &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, &quot;Beaumont is a goldmine for talent, I&#x27;ll guarantee you every label in Nashville could go down there for a couple of months and find at least four or five entertainers.&quot; Walker also stated, &quot;I&#x27;m a lot more influenced by Haggard than anyone else. I like those powerful ballads and two-steppin music. I love swing too, but it&#x27;s probably that competition thing again.&quot; Walker told the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; in addition to Merle Haggard, &quot;My influences were Hank Williams Sr., George Jones, and Charley Pride – the kind of country my dad liked, the kind I grew up on. I&#x27;m convinced traditional country music will come back more and more. After all it&#x27;s the real thing. It&#x27;s honest, and it&#x27;s not just a sound, it&#x27;s a way of life.&quot;

==Content==
&quot;What&#x27;s It to You&quot; was previously recorded by Curtis Wright, its co-writer, on his 1992 self-titled debut. &quot;Dreaming with My Eyes Open&quot; was also featured in the soundtrack to the 1993 film &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot;. The final track, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How Love Starts&quot;, was co-written by Pirates of the Mississippi member Rich Alves and was also previously recorded by Wright on his 1992 Liberty album.

==Critical reception==

Geoffrey Hines of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The impressive debut album by Clint Black mastermind James Stroud, reveals a young man still casting about for his own style but nonetheless bringing a handsome, personal tenor and a sure rhythmic instinct to every song he tries. Offering a more promising for this youngster are the five songs he co-wrote himself; they boast the sort of lyric detail and musical build that bring out the best in his voice.&quot; Mary Jo DiLonardo of &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; gave the album three and a half stars out of five and wrote, &quot;Already risking comparisons to Garth Brooks and Clint Black, Walker has a strong voice, rugged cowboy looks (a &quot;must&quot; for videos) and a good crop of songs.&quot; Joe Breen of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said, &quot;Best newcomer award goes to Clay Walker whose eponymous album sounds like it&#x27;s worth checking out. Better value will be hard to find this year.&quot;

Dave Molter of the &quot;Observer-Reporter&quot; gave the album two and a half stars and wrote, &quot;Walker&#x27;s voice is clear, if not distinctive and he has the kind of chiseled good looks that might me him rise above the heard.&quot; Mia Carlson of the &quot;Lewiston Morning Tribune&quot; gave the album a favorable review and wrote, &quot;It sounds like Giant records has put a lot of faith in this young Texan. Definitely worth a few more listens.&quot; Carlson also praised Walker&#x27;s song writing as well as James Stroud&#x27;s production. Jon Rawl of &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; gave the album three stars and wrote, &quot;This album proves he may be a Walker, but he hits the ground running.&quot; Rawl also wrote, &quot;Clay Walker sounds like a seasoned professional on this debut album.&quot;

<text>Eastgate Shopping Centre is a super-regional shopping centre in Bedfordview, near Bedford Gardens and the Johannesburg city centre in Gauteng. It remains one of the largest centres in the country and is the fourth largest shopping centre in Gauteng, after Mall of Africa, Sandton City and Menlyn Park. The centre lies next to the R24 airport freeway, between the Johannesburg CBD to the west and O. R. Tambo International Airport to the east.

== History ==
Eastgate was Johannesburg&#x27;s first &#x27;super-regional&#x27; shopping centre. The decision to build Eastgate was taken in 1974 by Rapp &amp; Maister. It was to be built on an 18 ha site with 5 ha inside the Johannesburg municipality while the other 13 ha was in Bedfordview. It was planned to be opened in 1978 and would have 90,000sqm of retail space with major tenants being OK Bazaars, Edgars, Woolworths, Greatermans and John Orrs. There would be another 180 smaller stores, four cinemas and 5,000 parking bays. When it opened in 1979, it was the largest shopping centre in the southern hemisphere.

===Further upgrades===
A expansion was completed in 2010, which brings Eastgate to over . A few years later, the centre underwent another major redevelopment by Liberty Life to modernise both the retail and office components, which was completed in 2017. To this day, it is managed by Liberty Properties on behalf of the parent company, Liberty Holdings Limited. The centre is currently over .

Eastgate Shopping Centre is frequented by over 80,000 shoppers on Saturdays and over 2 million shoppers during an average month. The shopping centre offers Bureau de change facilities. Major retailers include one of the most successful Woolworths in South Africa and a recently refurbished cinema complex. The centre has over 250 stores, which include more than 60 fashion boutiques and 13 jewellers.

Unusual for a single complex, the building straddled the municipal boundaries of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality. However, in 2013, the boundary was adjusted by the Municipal Demarcation Board to move Eastgate fully into Ekurhuleni.

<doc id="1073013" wikidata="Q6775496" url="?curid=1073013" title="Martin Gallagher">
<text>Martin Owen Gallagher (born 11 February 1952) is a New Zealand politician and was Labour member of Parliament representing the Hamilton West electorate until November 2008. Currently, he is councillor on the Hamilton City Council West Ward as well as Deputy Mayor of Hamilton.

==Early life==
Gallagher was educated at Hamilton Boys&#x27; High School, and the University of Waikato where he completed a Bachelor of Social Science degree. He is a qualified teacher.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===


He was first elected to Parliament in the 1993 election, when he won the Hamilton West electorate. In the 1996 election, however, he was defeated by National&#x27;s Bob Simcock. In the 1999 election, he won back the electorate. At the 2005 election, he had a slender majority of 825 votes, 2.0% more than his opponent. In the 2008 general election he was defeated by National&#x27;s Tim Macindoe. His list placing of 41 meant that he was not returned to Parliament. The swing in Hamilton West at the 2008 election against Gallagher was less than half the nationwide swing against his Government.

Gallagher was Chairperson of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Select Committee and formerly the Law and Order Select Committee.

===Local body politics===
Before standing for Parliament, Gallagher was a councillor for the Hamilton City Council from 1985–1994, and served as Deputy Mayor of Hamilton from 1988 to 1993, and again from 2016 to 2019.

After losing his Parliamentary seat in 2008, Gallagher returned to local body politics. In the 2010 and 2013 local elections, he ran for the Hamilton City Council and the Waikato District Health Board as an independent candidate. He was returned for both positions in each election.

==Personal life==
Gallagher has four children and is a cousin of Sir William Gallagher, of the well known Waikato family who run Gallagher Group, an international farming and security company.

Gallagher is a Justice of the Peace. He returned to teaching after being ousted in the 2008 election.

<text>South Otago lies in the south east of the South Island of New Zealand. As the name suggests, it forms the southernmost part of the geographical region of Otago.

The exact definition of the area designated as South Otago is imprecise, as the area is defined not in geopolitical or administrative terms, but rather by the area&#x27;s topographical features and the similarity of its communities. The area is often seen as roughly congruous with the Clutha District, which has its administrative centre at Balclutha. However, most of the Taieri catchment, from Taieri Mouth and Henley to Mosgiel and Middlemarch, with the coastal areas around Brighton, has been part of the City of Dunedin since 1989. The southwestern part of Clutha District, around the townships of Tapanui and Clinton, are regarded as part of a separate area, West Otago.

==Geography==
South Otago is dominated by three main topographic features: forests, hill country, and floodplains. To the south is the rough bush country of the Catlins, with its forests and rugged coastline. To the north of that the land is mainly rolling hill country, dissected by the floodplains of several large rivers. With the exception of the flat, fertile floodplains, South Otago is quite sparsely populated because of relatively cold winters, geographical isolation and lack of a decent port. A former port, Port Molyneux, located near the mouth of the Clutha River was abandoned in the early 20th century after rail transportation made freighting produce by rail to and from Dunedin more economically attractive.

There are a number of rivers flowing through South Otago, the largest being the Clutha / Matau-Au, the country&#x27;s second longest river, which flows from Lake Wānaka in Central Otago for 340 kilometres, through Balclutha (Scots Gaelic for &quot;Town on the banks of the Clyde&quot;) and there splits in two around the large delta island of Inch Clutha before reaching the Pacific Ocean. A significant west-flowing tributary is the Tuapeka River, starting point of the 1860s Otago gold rush near Lawrence.

Also of note is the Taieri, the country&#x27;s fourth longest river, which winds through rough hill country before forming the Taieri Plains to the north-east of Milton then cutting through coastal hills to reach the ocean at Taieri Mouth. Lakes Waihola, Mahinerangi, and Waipori, which ultimately drain into the Taieri through its tributary the Waipori River, are also located in South Otago.

Between and roughly parallel with those two large rivers is the smaller Tokomairaro River, which drains the Milton area.
The most populous town is Balclutha, 81 km south of Dunedin by road (except for the occasional inclusion of the larger Mosgiel in definitions of South Otago). It serves as the main service town for the area&#x27;s large farming community. Balclutha&#x27;s population, by the 2006 census, was 4,062 (down from 4,137 in 1996). Other towns are Milton (pop. 1,887), Kaitangata (pop. 810), Brighton, Lawrence (pop. 432), Owaka (pop. 327), Stirling (pop. 309), Waihola, Outram, Allanton, Henley, Momona, Kaka Point (pop. 201), Taieri Mouth, and Benhar (pop. 96). For a while in the 1980s Balclutha was New Zealand&#x27;s most wealthy town, per capita.

==History==
The area has a rich history, with Māori iwi and predominantly Scottish settlers, the latter of whom arrived in the 1840s and 1850s. As happened in most of the South Island, the land was bought by these settlers from its original Māori inhabitants. Later, the main Māori tribe from the area, Kai Tahu, received a large cash settlement from the New Zealand Government as reparation for the confiscation of land that took place during that colonisation period.
The Otago gold rush of the 1860s, initially centred around Lawrence, drew thousands of men to the district in search of wealth. The discovery of coal at Kaitangata was also important for the regions development, and was also responsible for one of Otago&#x27;s worst disasters, an explosion at the mine in 1879. Other minerals mined in South Otago include silica and phosphate.

In more recent times the region has been associated with woollen milling and forestry. Sheep, dairy cattle and deer are farmed locally, and farming and farm-related industries are the mainstay of the region&#x27;s economy. Tourism, particularly around the Catlins, is also becoming important to the region.

South Otago&#x27;s close association with Dunedin has increased since the reorganisation of local government areas in the 1980s. The northern part of South Otago, including much of the Taieri Plains, is now within the boundaries of Dunedin City (the rest of the area is almost entirely within Clutha District). The location of Dunedin International Airport at Momona is the area&#x27;s most important transport hub, though most of the people who use this travel only briefly through South Otago while commuting to and from Dunedin. South Otago is also home to Lake Mahinerangi, Dunedin&#x27;s most important reservoir, which is located close to the top of Maungatua.

==People==
Residents of South Otago and Southland have a prominent accent which is noticeably different from that of the rest of New Zealand, with a rolling &#x27;r&#x27; that is almost certainly an indication of the Gaelic roots of many of the residents. This is also indicated in the Scots Gaelic and Lallans Scots origins of many of the area&#x27;s placenames. The people are paradoxically warm and friendly yet wary of strangers in their midst.

The main schools are South Otago High School in Balclutha and Tokomairiro High School in Milton.

<doc id="1073028" wikidata="Q17092279" url="?curid=1073028" title="If I Could Make a Living">
<text>If I Could Make a Living is the second studio album by American country music singer Clay Walker, released in 1994 on Giant Records. Like his self-titled debut album, this album was certified platinum by the RIAA. It produced the singles &quot;If I Could Make a Living&quot;, &quot;This Woman and This Man&quot;, and &quot;My Heart Will Never Know&quot;, which respectively reached #1, #1, and #16 on the Hot Country Songs charts.

==Background==
In a telephone interview with &quot;Tulsa World&quot; Walker said, &quot;I approached the second [album] a little bit differently from the first one, because it&#x27;s kind of like scuba diving, the first time, you&#x27;re down there at the bottom, and it&#x27;s a little bit dirty, so you have to feel around a lot before you can find the treasure. For the second one, the water was a little more clear.&quot; He also said, &quot;The only thing I try to do is just look for good songs, and not worry about what kind they are. I think if you do that, it does two things: It gets you some hits on radio, and it gives the listener a little variety.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; Walker said, &quot;Speaking of the `sophomore jinx,&#x27; I&#x27;ve got the `sophomore jitters.&#x27; I hope my second album does as well as the first album. I think I&#x27;ve progressed some as a singer and performer since the first one, but they (the buying public) have to like what&#x27;s on the album itself if they&#x27;re going to buy it.&quot; He also stated, &quot; On the first album, I&#x27;d been writing for years and had all my best work to pick from ... That&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve missed, not being able to write on the road. I went home for two weeks and wrote three songs for this album.&quot; Walker told the &quot;Boca Raton News&quot;, about his success of his albums and said, &quot;It&#x27;s really because of radio. They&#x27;ll play music they think is good. I&#x27;m flattered to be considered one of the artists they like.&quot;

After the album&#x27;s release, Walker stated, &quot;I&#x27;ll be honest, the second album could have been stronger, but with the success we&#x27;ve had, I know we avoided the sophomore jinx. I just felt really pressed when selecting songs for the entire album.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, Walker said, &quot;In the early &#x27;80s and maybe even the late &#x27;80s it was an artist-driven business. You probably weren&#x27;t taken seriously if you weren&#x27;t over 35 years old. Now, it&#x27;s a song-driven format. You still have to go out there and hit a home run with every single you release. There are so many artists out there that do mediocre material but can sing. And it doesn&#x27;t matter how good you sing, how many notes you can hit, how high or how low you can go, you have to make people believe what you&#x27;re singing. You can&#x27;t fool the public all the time. It makes me buckle down and try to find the best music I can find. I don&#x27;t take any chances. I&#x27;m not looking for one-hit wonders or that gimmick record. I want growth. I want it to take a steady climb.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Bankrate&quot; when asked about if the lyrics to the song &quot;Money Ain&#x27;t Everything&quot; represent a longing for a more simple life Walker responded &quot;Well, I feel blessed everyday for what God has given me. I think I appreciate every show more than I used to because I know it could be taken from me. But part of the song -- &quot;What good is first place when you&#x27;re in a rat race ... money ain&#x27;t everything,&quot; means I have tried to remain true to myself and be completely honest as a recording artist and a man. Everything that has happened to me over the last several years gave me a newfound courage.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Chris Rimlinger of &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; gave the album a B+ rating and wrote &quot;This sophomore project, while not quite as satisfying as his first one, reinforces his credibility as an up-and-coming major player. Walker has written and chosen material that treat old themes in new ways. And his vocal intensity carries them all off. Susan Beyer of &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; gave the album a mixed review and wrote, &quot; At times, he sounds a little too congested, especially when he sings ballads written by others. But when he gets into a Texas swing on his own he&#x27;s fine. What Do You Want For Nothing stands out for its tougher sentiments and sound. Occasionally, he heads for Garth Brooks territory in story songs that try to make a mountain out of a molehill of emotion. Mario Tarradell of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; wrote, &quot;If I Could Make A Living, offers a slightly more inventive batch of tunes (excluding the by-the-numbers title cut) than his first record.&quot;

<text>The San Juan Bautista School of Medicine (SJBSM) is a private medical school in Caguas, Puerto Rico. It formally opened its doors in 1978. The school grants the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Master in Public Health (M.P.H.), Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS), and Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees. The institution also has a local Transitional Year program.

==History==
SJBSM was founded in 1978 in San Juan, Puerto Rico as a non profit corporation, incorporated under the laws of Puerto Rico. In 1979, it was authorized by the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico to offer studies pertinent to the M.D. degree. The institution continued to develop through the years, and it moved its facilities to the city of Caguas in 1988, an important urban center in Puerto Rico with nearly 150,000 inhabitants.

In February 1998, the Middle States Association, granted Candidacy for Accreditation Status to the School. It was in November 1998 that was certified to participate in the Title IV Program of the Department of Federal Education, specifically in the Federal Family Education Loan Program. In 1999, the school bought Caguas&#x27; Regional Hospital, Dr. Eduardo Garrido Morales, and took control over its operations under the name of San Juan Bautista Hospital. In 2004, SJBSM was accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. SJBSM has been accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education since 2007. It also became a member of the Board of Medical Examiners of Puerto Rico.

In late 2011, the assets of the San Juan Bautista Hospital were acquired by the Mennonite Health System (Sistema de Salud Menonita), changing its name to Hospital Menonita de Caguas. As part of a thirty-year rental agreement, the Department of Health of Puerto Rico conditioned the acquisition on retaining the school of medicine and its residencies.

<doc id="1073032" wikidata="Q3595927" url="?curid=1073032" title="Juwayriya bint al-Harith">
<text>Juwayriya bint Harith (; ) was the eighth wife of Muhammad and so, considered to be a Mother of the Believers.

==Family background==
She was the daughter of Al-Hārith ibn Abi Dirar, the chief of Banu Mustaliq, who was defeated with his tribe in a battle.

==Conflict between Muslims and Banu Mustaliq==
Two months after Muḥammad returned from the Expedition of Dhū Qarad, he began to hear rumours that the Banū al-Muṣṭaliq were preparing to attack him, so he sent a spy, Buraydah ibn Al-Ḥasīb Al-Aslamī, to confirm this. The Banū al-Muṣṭaliq also believed that Muḥammad was preparing to attack them. So they in turn sent a spy reconnoiter to explore the positions of the Muslims, but he was captured and killed by them.

The two armies were stationed at a well called Al-Muraysī&#x27;, near the sea, a short distance from Mecca. They fought with bows and arrows for an hour, and then the Muslims advanced rapidly, they surrounded the al-Muṣṭaliq and took the entire tribe as prisoners, with their families, herds and flock. The battle ended in full victory for the Muslims. Two hundred families were taken as captives, two hundred camels, five thousand sheep, goats, as well as a huge quantity of household goods which were captured as booty. The household goods were sold in an auction to the highest bidder.

The Mustaliq lost a total of ten men. Only one Muslim was killed by mistake by a Helper. Juwayrīyah bint al-Ḥārith, daughter of the Banū al-Muṣṭaliq chief was one of the captives.

==Marriage to Muhammad==
After minimal casualties, the Muslim forces were victorious. Among the many captives was Juwayriya, whose husband Mustafa bin Safwan, had been killed in the battle. She initially fell among Muhammad&#x27;s companion Thabit ibn Qays ibn Al-Shammas. Troubled by this, Juwayriya sought a deed of redemption from Muhammad. Muhammad proposed to marry her and, as a result, freed her from the bondage of Thabit ibn Qais and consequently ameliorated the condition of her captured tribe.

This incident was described in more detail:

&quot;At the first opportunity (after her capture) she went to the Prophet, and pleaded her case with him. She told him that she was the daughter of a chieftain and used to command and because of her unfortunate circumstance she found herself in this helpless position. From a throne made of gold she had fallen into dust. ...How could she possibly live the life as a slave? She pleaded with the Prophet, to take notice of the pitiful and desperate condition in which she found herself.

The Prophet, was moved by her sorrowful plea and asked her if she would like to live as a free woman and be part of his household if he paid her ransom. She had never in her dreams expected this offer. Moved deeply by this unexpected elevation in her status, she exclaimed she would be more than happy to accept.&quot;

Some time later her father and all the men of her tribe who had been freed also accepted Islam as their religion.

Consequently, she was married to Muhammad, the Islamic prophet when he was 57 years old and she was 19, thus placing the marriage in 627-628.
She was married to the prophet for four years, and died 44 years later.

==Death and burial==
She died at the age of sixty-five in the 50th year after migration and was buried with the other wives of Muhammad in Jannatul Baqi&#x27;.

==Her qualities==
Juwayriya was described as being very beautiful and refined:
*She was brought up in the lap of luxury, and had all the refinements and graces of a princess. Intelligent and wise, she mastered language and literary style. This was an accomplishment much prized by contemporary Arabs.
*All who saw [Juwayriya] were stunned by her exceptional beauty. Brought up as she had been in one of the foremost families of the time, she was not only beautiful but graceful, elegant, and eloquent.
*When Muhammad&#x27;s wife &#x27;Aisha first saw her it is said she exclaimed that Juwayriyah was &quot;as beautiful as a fairy&quot;.

<doc id="1073036" wikidata="Q536097" url="?curid=1073036" title="Florencia de la V">
<text>Florencia Trinidad (born 2 March 1975), better known by her stage name Flor de la V, is an Argentine trans-woman, actress, television personality, comedian and vedette. As producer Gerardo Sofovich&#x27;s protégée, who discovered her in a 1998 revue in Buenos Aires, De La V gained media exposure and got small television roles. Her role in the widely successful &quot;Los Roldán&quot; gave her international notoriety. Over the years, she has become a household name in Argentine show business.

In 2014, GLAAD stated that &quot;through her advocacy and proud visibility, [she] has contributed immensely to advancing the equality movement around the world and particularly in Argentina.&quot; She became the first transgender person in Argentina to get her name and the gender on her government-issued ID legally changed without pathologizing her gender identity, two years before the national Gender Identity Law was established.

In 2021, Flor de la V announced that she identified as a travesti, writing: &quot;I discovered a more correct way to get in touch with how I feel: neither woman, nor heterosexual, nor homosexual, nor bisexual. I am a dissident of the gender system, my political construction in this society is that of a pure-bred travesti. That what I am and what I want and choose to be.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
De La V was born in the city of Monte Grande, Buenos Aires Province. The family home was located in Villa Los Lirios. When De La V was two years old, her mother died, and she moved to Lomas de Zamora (Province of Buenos Aires) with her father and brother.

At age 16, De La V dressed-up as a young lady to attend the sweet 16th birthday party of her best friend. From then on she became known as Karen, until she was renamed by a friend as “Florencia de la Vega”; eventually for legal reasons her name was adapted to Florencia de la V.

=== Education ===

She completed her primary and high-school in the suburbs of Lomas de Zamora, located in the southwest part of greater Buenos Aires. A fashion enthusiast since she made her first dress, she decided to follow a career in fashion design at the UNNE, the National University of the Northeast, Argentina. As Karen, she began her career producing outfits and theatrical garments for Burlesque and Musical productions.

=== Career summary ===
* Florencia de La V began cross-dressing at the age of 16. She enrolled in a university in fashion design, and later took jobs as a designer and promoter.
* She also worked at the popular Buenos Aires club &quot;Tabaris&quot;, replacing Cris Miró, a well known transvestite, in the show. It was while working there that she became a vedette, catching the eyes of television and theater producer Gerardo Sofovich.
* She made her acting debut in the TV show &quot;Polémica en el Bar&quot; (&quot;Controversy at the Bar&quot;).
* De La V subsequently played small roles in many telenovelas and variety shows for Argentina&#x27;s Telefe, but the show that made her an internationally known star has arguably been &quot;Los Roldán&quot; (2004), a sitcom that became a hit across South America and among digital television viewers in the United States. In &quot;Los Roldán&quot;, she played as &quot;Raul Roldán&quot;, a transvestite who goes under the name &quot;Laisa Roldán&quot; when dressed as a woman.
* In 2012 she became the hostess of the semi-acted comedy and gossip show &quot;La Pelu&quot;, with actress and comedian Gladys Florimonte.
Florencia de La V expressed that she felt a little uncomfortable at first with being given a job as a transvestite in the soap opera. Later on, however, she accepted the fact that her character shares some life characteristics with her, which made her more comfortable about playing &quot;Laisa Roldán&quot;. She has said, however, that for her next roles, she would prefer to play a woman. After &quot;Los Roldán&quot; ended, Florencia De La V worked in Mar Del Plata.

In 1998, she met her partner, dentist Pablo Goycochea, whom she married on 2011 in Buenos Aires. She has two children, twins, a boy and girl.

=== Gender controversy ===
During August 2014, well-known Argentine reporter Jorge Lanata declared that De La V was not a woman but a transsexual. Actor Dario Grandinetti made a public comment on a Buenos Aires radio station supporting De La V and Lanata threatened Grandinetti with a perjury lawsuit.

<text>Go Down, Moses is a 1942 collection of seven related pieces of short fiction by American author William Faulkner, sometimes considered a novel. The most prominent character and unifying voice is that of Isaac McCaslin, &quot;Uncle Ike&quot;, who will live to be an old man; &quot;uncle to half a county and father to no one&quot;. Though originally published as a short story collection, Faulkner considered the book to be a novel in the same way &quot;The Unvanquished&quot; is considered a novel. Because of this, most editions no longer print &quot;and other stories&quot; in the title.

The year is about 1859. &quot;Cass&quot; lives with his grand-uncles Theophilus and Amodeus McCaslin, called &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; and &quot;Uncle Buddy&quot; respectively by most of the characters in the book. The story opens with the news that Tomey&#x27;s Turl, a slave on the McCaslin plantation, has run away. But this is not the first time this has happened and Uncle Buck and Buddy know where he always goes, to Hubert Beauchamp&#x27;s neighboring plantation to see his love, a slave girl named Tennie. Beauchamp himself has an unmarried sister, Sophonsiba, nicknamed &quot;Sibbey&quot;, who seems romantically interested in Buck. Forced to stay the night to look for Tomey&#x27;s Turl, Buck and Cass accidentally enter Sophonsiba&#x27;s room, thinking it to be their room. This situation is exploited by Hubert who tries to pressure Buck into marrying Sophonsiba. Buck does not agree to Hubert&#x27;s exploitive interpretation of events. Buck, Buddy and Hubert settle both their situation and that of Tomey&#x27;s Turl by tying them to the outcome of a poker match. If Buck loses, he is to marry Sophonsiba and must agree to buy the slave girl Tennie so Turl will stop running away to see her. Buck loses, but coaxes Hubert into allowing another game, Hubert against Buddy, to determine the marriage and property issues. The stakes are changed many times, but in the end Buddy wins and the McCaslins take Tennie for free.

Uncle Buck and Sophonsiba Beauchamp eventually marry and become the parents of Isaac McCaslin, the central character who serves to unify most of the stories in the novel.

&quot;Was&quot; serves to introduce the reader into the practices and mentality of the antebellum South. Where Tomey&#x27;s Turl is first introduced, he seems to be referred to more as an animal, such as a horse, than a person. When Hubert and Buck are taking bets on where Tomey&#x27;s Turl will show up, the reader further sees how far removed from human the slaves are in the eyes of the owners. (Faulkner later reveals that Tomey&#x27;s Turl is Buck and Buddy&#x27;s half-brother, the son of their father, Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin, and his slave Tomey.) Additionally, it is possible Faulkner intends for the entrapping of Buck into marriage with Sophonsiba to be analogous to slavery, although Buck seems to accept it silently.

==&quot;Was&quot;==
===Summary===

Old Isaac McCaslin heard this story, relating events that took place before he was born, from his older cousin, McCaslin Edmonds, who was 16 years his senior and like a father to him:
A young child, McCaslin Edmonds, rides with his Uncle Buck to the neighboring plantation of Hubert Beauchamp, in pursuit of an escaped slave. The slave, Tomey&#x27;s Turl, runs away frequently to visit Tennie, a slave of the Beauchamps with whom he is in love. Tomey&#x27;s Turl eludes McCaslin and Uncle Buck, who are forced to rely on the leisurely Hubert Beauchamp for help. They are forced to eat dinner with Beauchamp and his sister Sophonsiba, &quot;Sibbey&quot;, who is looking for a husband and has Uncle Buck in mind. Hubert and Buck search through the woods for Turl and make a 500-dollar bet over whether he will be caught outside Tennie&#x27;s cabin that night. That night he is indeed at the cabin, but he runs past them and eludes capture. Buck and young McCaslin are forced to spend the night at the plantation house.

Buck and the boy accidentally go into the wrong bedroom and discover Sophonsiba lying in the bed. She wakes up and screams, and Beauchamp takes advantage of the situation to try to pressure Buck to marry Sophonsiba. Buck rejects the idea angrily, and the two men play cards to settle things: a single hand of poker will decide whether Buck will have to marry Sophonsiba and also who has to buy the other&#x27;s slave, since the situation with Tennie and Tomey&#x27;s Turl is clearly unmanageable as it is. Buck loses the hand and sends McCaslin home to fetch Buck&#x27;s twin brother, Buddy, a legendary poker player. Buddy arrives and coaxes Beauchamp into another poker game. They spend a great deal of time hammering out the stakes, but in the end, Beauchamp folds, and Buddy wins the game. Uncle Buck, Uncle Buddy, McCaslin, Tennie, and Tomey&#x27;s Turl return to the McCaslin plantation—Tennie and Tomey&#x27;s Turl will be married.

===Themes===

Faulkner&#x27;s technique in &quot;Go Down, Moses&quot; is to present stories whose full significance in the overall history of his characters is not apparent until later in the book. The book explores the history and development of the McCaslin family, descended from Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin (&quot;Carothers McCaslin&quot;) and occupies the plantation he founded. Faulkner incorporates into the McCaslin family many of the characteristics he viewed as essential to an understanding of the South as a whole, including the painful racial divide between whites and blacks that defined Southern history in the decades before and after the Civil War. He does this by splitting the McCaslin family tree into two branches, one white and the other black. The white branch, obviously, descends from Carothers McCaslin and his wife; the black branch descends from Carothers McCaslin and the slave-girl Tomey, with whom McCaslin had a sexual relationship.

&quot;Was&quot;, which appears at first to be simply an innocuous and amusing story (if one historically appalling in its treatment of blacks and women as things to be gambled over) about the marital maneuverings between a spinster and an affirmed bachelor, is actually the story of the origin of the black branch of the McCaslin family tree. Tomey&#x27;s Turl is Carothers McCaslin&#x27;s son, Buck and Buddy&#x27;s half-brother, by the slave girl Tomey. Turl and his own wife, Tennie, will continue the black McCaslin branch into the future.

On its own terms, &quot;Was&quot; is a brilliant set-piece, a probing look at the past and a handy opportunity for Faulkner to establish some of the important McCaslins—Buck and Buddy, the old bachelor twins, and the young McCaslin Edmonds. With the brief introduction to the story, Faulkner also creates a presence for old Isaac McCaslin and indicates a distant future in which this story is simply a memory of something overheard, a &quot;was&quot; instead of an &quot;is.&quot; Isaac McCaslin will prove to be the central character in Go Down, Moses, and Faulkner helps build his stature in the reader&#x27;s mind by introducing him in advance in the first two stories of the book.

==&quot;The Fire and the Hearth&quot;==

===Summary===

Many years later (around 1941) Lucas Beauchamp, the son of Tomey&#x27;s Turl and Tennie, lives and works on the McCaslin plantation, now owned by Carothers &quot;Roth&quot; Edmonds, the grandson of Carothers McCaslin &quot;Cass&quot; Edmonds (Isaac and Lucas&#x27; elder cousin). Lucas discovers a gold coin on the land and becomes convinced of a large hidden treasure. Also, Lucas&#x27; daughter is being pursued for marriage, despite her father&#x27;s wishes, by a poor black man, George Wilkins.

Lucas and George both distill liquor illegally, and Lucas decides to prevent Wilkins&#x27; marriage to his daughter by telling Roth, since the liquor is being made on Roth&#x27;s land. Roth calls the authorities, but they arrive just as Wilkins has put large jugs of whiskey on Lucas&#x27; porch and as his daughter hides the still in his own backyard. While Lucas&#x27; daughter cannot testify against Lucas due to kinship, George Wilkins can. Consequently, Lucas is forced into allowing the marriage between Wilkins and his daughter to prevent Wilkins from having to testify against him. Lucas returns to the plantation and cons a salesman out of a metal detector to search for the treasure he adamantly believes exists. The search becomes an obsession, and Lucas&#x27; wife asks Roth for a divorce. Lucas initially agrees to the divorce but recants at the last moment, deciding he&#x27;s too old. The treasure isn&#x27;t meant for him to find.

===Themes===

Touched upon is the impotence of the black man&#x27;s actions. Lucas must persuade Roth, a man a generation younger than Lucas and seemingly less deserving of the Carothers plantation than Lucas is, to report George Wilkins in order for the tip off to be taken seriously by authorities. 

==&quot;Pantaloon in Black&quot;==

===Summary===

Rider, an incredibly strong and large black man who lives on Carothers &quot;Roth&quot; Edmonds&#x27; plantation, is bereaved by the death of his wife. He digs his wife&#x27;s grave at great speed, and the visitors at the funeral wonder why he is digging his wife into the ground so quickly. 

That night, Rider believes he sees his wife&#x27;s ghost. He returns to work at a sawmill the next day, but after chucking an incredibly large log down a hill, walks off the job and buys a jug of whiskey, drinking copiously. Rider goes to the tool room at the mill and confronts a man named Birdsong, who has been cheating black men in dice for years. Rider cuts Birdsong&#x27;s throat. The narrative shifts, and the story is now in the home of the local sheriff&#x27;s deputy.

Rider is quickly tried and taken to the sheriff&#x27;s cell. He breaks the cell up a good deal. A party of white men arrive, take Rider, and lynch him.

==&quot;The Old People&quot;==
===Summary===
In the forest, Sam Fathers, the son of a Chickasaw chief and a black slave-girl, teaches Isaac McCaslin how to hunt. When Isaac is deemed old enough to go on the yearly hunting expeditions with Major de Spain, General Compson, and Isaac&#x27;s older cousin McCaslin Edmonds, he kills his first buck, and Sam Fathers ritualistically anoints him with its blood. Isaac remembers Sam Fathers’ history; the son of Ikkemotubbe, the chief who sold the land to the white people and also sold his son and wife into slavery, Sam left the Jefferson area for the big forest after the death of Jobaker, his Choctaw friend. Sam now tends the hunting camp of Major de Spain and McCaslin Edmonds.

After Isaac kills his buck, the group is making ready to leave, when Boon Hogganbeck rides in on a mule declaring that he has just seen a massive buck. The group disperses to try to hunt the big deer before they leave. Sam leads Isaac to a clearing; they hear Walter Ewell&#x27;s horn, and Isaac assumes the buck has been killed. But then a giant buck comes down the slope toward them and looks at them with gravity and dignity. Sam calls it &quot;grandfather.&quot; They do not shoot at it.

That night, McCaslin and Isaac stay at Major de Spain&#x27;s house near Jefferson, 17 miles away from the McCaslin plantation. In bed, Isaac tells McCaslin about the buck, and McCaslin speculates that it represented some form of indomitable, primal energy that grows up out of the earth from all the blood that seeps into it and all the lives it absorbs. Isaac thinks that McCaslin does not believe him, that he is accusing him of claiming to have seen a ghost; but McCaslin tells him solemnly that he, too, has seen the buck: Sam took him into that same clearing the day he killed his first deer.

==&quot;The Bear&quot;==
===Summary===
As Isaac grows older, he becomes an expert hunter and woodsman, and continues going with the hunting parties every year. The group becomes increasingly preoccupied with hunting down Old Ben, a monstrous, almost immortal bear that wreaks havoc throughout the forest. Old Ben&#x27;s foot was maimed in a trap, and he seems impervious to bullets.

Isaac learns to track Old Ben, but hunting him is futile, because all the hounds fear him. Sam Fathers, who teaches Isaac Old Ben&#x27;s ways, says that it will take an extraordinary dog to bring Old Ben down.

Isaac sees Old Ben several times. Once, they send a tiny fyce-dog with no sense of danger after him, and Isaac has a shot at the huge bear. But instead of taking the shot, Isaac runs after the fyce and dives to save him from the bear. Isaac looks up at Old Ben looming over him and remembers the image from his dreams about the bear.

At last they find a dog capable of bringing Old Ben to bay: Lion, a huge, wild Airedale Terrier mix with extraordinary courage and savagery. Sam makes Lion semi-tame by starving him until he will allow himself to be touched; soon, Boon Hogganbeck has devoted himself to Lion and even shares a bed with him.

Using Lion, they nearly catch Old Ben, but Boon misses five point-blank shots. General Compson hits the bear and draws blood, but Old Ben escapes into the forest.

Isaac and Boon go into Memphis to buy whisky for the men, and the next day, they go after the bear again. General Compson declares that he wants Isaac to ride Kate, the only mule who is not afraid of wild animals and, therefore, the best chance any of the men have to get close enough to the bear to kill him.

In the deep woods, near the river, Lion leaps at Old Ben and takes hold of his throat. Old Ben seizes Lion and begins shredding his stomach with its claws. Boon draws his knife and throws himself on top of the bear, stabbing it in its back. Old Ben dies, and a few days later, Lion dies. Sam Fathers collapses after the fight and dies not long after Lion. Lion and Sam are buried in the same clearing.

Isaac returns to the farm near Jefferson, to the old McCaslin plantation. Time passes; eventually he is 21, time for him to assume control of the plantation, which is his by inheritance. But he renounces it in favor of his older cousin (once-removed), McCaslin Edmonds. Isaac has a long argument with McCaslin in which Isaac declares his belief that the land cannot be owned, that the curse of God&#x27;s Earth is man&#x27;s attempt to own the land, and that curse has led to slavery and the destruction of the South. McCaslin tries to convince him to accept the land, with a convoluted metaphysical argument about the fated responsibilities the white race has taken on. But Isaac remembers reading the old ledger books of Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy, piecing together the sordid story of the plantation&#x27;s slaves, and he refuses the inheritance. 

(One of Isaac&#x27;s inferences is particularly appalling: Tomey, the slave whom Carothers McCaslin took as a lover and begat Turl, may also have been Carothers McCaslin&#x27;s daughter by another slave, Eunice, who committed suicide shortly before Turl&#x27;s birth. From this and other factors, Isaac deduces that she must also have been Carothers McCaslin&#x27;s lover.)

After refusing the inheritance, Isaac moves into town and becomes a carpenter, eschewing material possessions. He marries a woman who urges him to take back the plantation, but he still refuses when she attempts to convince him sexually. It is suggested there are no further conjugal relations between them after this as they have no children. Isaac tries to distribute fairly the money left to the children of Tomey&#x27;s Turl and Tennie. He travels to Arkansas to give a thousand dollars to Lucas&#x27; sister, Fonsiba, now married to a scholarly negro farmer, who seems to neglect both his farm and wife. She refuses the money, but Isaac arranges for a nearby bank to pay it out in small monthly portions. Isaac continues to hunt and spend all the time he can in the woods.

One November, a few years later, he and a few of the old hunting group return to the wilderness camp where they had stalked Old Ben for so many years. Major de Spain has sold it to a logging company, and the trains come closer and louder than before. The wilderness is gradually being whittled away by farmers and loggers. Isaac visits the graves of Lion and Sam Fathers, then goes to find Boon Hogganbeck. Boon is in a clearing full of squirrels, trying to fix his gun. As Isaac enters, Boon shouts at him not to touch any of the squirrels: &quot;They&#x27;re mine!&quot; he cries.

===Publication history===
&quot;The Bear&quot; has a complex publication history. Its earliest version, first published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; (May 9, 1942), differs substantially from the &quot;Go Down, Moses&quot; version. A third version was published in Faulkner&#x27;s collection of hunting stories, &quot;Big Woods&quot; (1955).

==&quot;Delta Autumn&quot;==
===Summary===
This story serves as a sort of sequel or coda to &quot;The Bear&quot;. Ike McCaslin and Roth Edmonds are in a car with some friends, headed for what Ike suspects will be the last of his annual hunting expeditions. The wilderness has receded in recent years, and it is now a long trip by automobile. Along the way they discuss the worsening situation in Europe, with Roth taking the cynic&#x27;s view against Ike&#x27;s idealism. At one point Roth slams on the brakes, as if he saw someone or something standing along the road. He seems preoccupied and out of sorts.

The men eventually arrive at their campsite and set it up under Ike&#x27;s direction. During the night, the old man thinks about his bygone life and about how he and the wilderness are dying together.

The next morning the rest of the party set out to hunt while Ike chooses to sleep in. Roth gives him an envelope full of cash and mentions that a messenger might show up during the day. Ike is to hand over the money and “tell her I said ‘No.’”
Later that morning a boat arrives. It carries a dark-eyed young woman with a baby wrapped in a blanket. Ike, ashamed of acting as a go-between in such a sordid matter, informs her that Roth has left and tries to thrust the money on her. She refuses to take it immediately, and remarks that Roth has abandoned her. Ike contemptuously asks how she could have expected anything different from him.

As the conversation goes on, it becomes clear that the young woman knows a great deal about Ike’s family and his own life, more than Roth would probably have told her; she is part of the family herself, a distant Beauchamp cousin. Ike is dismayed at the miscegenation, even though he imagines the human race might one day be ready for interracial alliances. He tells the woman to marry a man “of her own race” and go far away. She replies that he is hardly qualified to advise anyone about love and leaves with the money in her slicker&#x27;s pocket and General Compson&#x27;s horn.

Ike is still pondering this disturbing incident when one of his hunting companions runs in, frantically looking for a knife. The old hunter deduces that Roth has killed a doe and is trying to hide the evidence: another family sin that must be covered up.

===Publication===
&quot;Delta Autumn&quot; was published in &quot;Story&quot; (May/June 1942).

==&quot;Go Down, Moses&quot;==
===Summary===
The book&#x27;s final story begins with a census interview, which places the action in 1940. A well-dressed and well-spoken young black man identifies himself as Samuel Beauchamp, a native of Yoknapatawpha County. After completing the census form, he is led back to his cell on Death Row.

The action shifts to Jefferson, the Yoknapatawpha county seat. The protagonist is Gavin Stevens, a local attorney and amateur Biblical scholar and detective. Mollie Beauchamp (Lucas&#x27; wife) has had a premonition of harm involving her long-lost grandson, Samuel. She begs Stevens to discover his whereabouts and condition. Stevens pities the old woman and accepts the job for a token fee.

Stevens soon discovers that Samuel Beauchamp is due to be executed in Illinois within hours. Without quite understanding why, he donates and collects enough money to bring the young man&#x27;s body home for a proper funeral. That evening, Stevens drops by the memorial service but quickly leaves, because he feels out of place. The funeral is held two days later.

===Analysis===
This is the shortest and most straightforward story in the book. The action is minimal. Its real importance lies in the fresh perspective it provides through Gavin Stevens, an educated and worldly man of the 20th century who would eventually become a key figure in Faulkner&#x27;s later fiction. Stevens is like several other white characters in &quot;Go Down, Moses&quot; in that his impression of blacks in general is quite paternalistic and tradition-bound. He is, however, capable of change; at the story&#x27;s end he experiences an epiphany when he learns that Mollie wants the funeral to be covered in the local newspaper &quot;just like anyone else&#x27;s&quot;. His realization ends the book on a somewhat hopeful note; perhaps the old cycle of exploitation and willful ignorance will not last forever after all.

Gavin Stevens also interacts with the Beauchamp family in the novel &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; (1948), in which he helps to save Lucas Beauchamp from a murder charge and a lynching. Some subtle clues seem to place that story a few years before &quot;Go Down, Moses.&quot;

===Publication===
&quot;Go Down, Moses&quot; first appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; (January 25, 1941).

<doc id="1073048" wikidata="Q2879826" url="?curid=1073048" title="Baila music">
<text>Baila (also known as bayila; from the Portuguese verb &quot;bailar&quot;, meaning &quot;to dance&quot;) is a form of music, popular in Sri Lanka and among Goan Catholics in India. The genre originated centuries ago among the Portuguese Burghers and Sri Lankan Kaffirs. Baila songs are played during parties and weddings in Sri Lanka, Goa, and Mangalore accompanied by dancing.

Baila music, as a form of folk art, has been popular for centuries in Sri Lanka. During the early 1960s, it entered into Sri Lanka&#x27;s mainstream culture, primarily through the work of police officer turned singer Wally Bastiansz. He began adapting the 6/8 &quot;&quot;kaffirhina&quot; rhythms to accommodate Sinhala lyrics. By the 1970s musicians, including MS Fernando and Maxwell Mendis, had helped Baila grow into a well known and respected style of Sri Lankan popular music. It is primarily considered dance music.

==History==
After their arrival in 1505, the Portuguese began to convert the Sinhalese to Roman Catholicism, building their wealth and power through the spice and slave trade. As early as 1630, African Kaffirs were brought to Sri Lanka to work as slaves or soldiers. The Kaffirs were once described as a people &#x27;steeped in opium and witless with drink&#x27;. The Kaffirs&#x27; carefree spirit inspired two music forms known as chicote and &quot;kafrinha&quot;&quot; infusing them with humour and satire. 

In 1894, Advocate Charles Matthew Fernando wrote that chicote as a &quot;slow and stately&quot; music, while &quot;kafrinha&quot; is &quot;faster and more boisterous&quot; and &quot;with a peculiar jerky movement&quot;. The word &quot;&quot;kafrinha&quot; itself comes from &quot;kaf&quot; (Kaffirs) and &quot;rinha&quot;&quot; which means &quot;local lady&quot;.
The Kaffirs and Portuguese Burghers mixed freely, and chicote and &quot;kafrinha&quot; gradually came to be known as baila, from Portuguese verb &#x27;bailar&#x27; meaning &#x27;to dance&#x27;.

Historically, Baila was a popular folk tradition along the coastal districts, where the Portuguese cultural influence was the strongest. These communities, mainly consisting of Portuguese traders, and the slaves that they had brought with them from the western coast of Africa, gradually combined with communities of native Sri Lankans. The musical style, now referred to as &quot;Baila&quot;, emerged from this cultural interchange. The genre was quick to spread around the whole island of Sri Lanka and was even influenced by Cuban &#x27;habanera&#x27; music, a form of dance music popular in the 1800s. With a history of over five hundred years, it is older than other relatively recent semi-classical traditions. 

The kafirs, particularly in Puttalam, view Baila and &quot;&quot;Kaffirinha&quot; tradition to be as intertwined with wedding ceremonies as wine and cake. The songs are accompanied exclusively by percussion instruments. Sri Lankan Burghers (the descendants from Portuguese) are the other group of inheritors of Baila and &quot;Kaffirinha&quot;&quot;, particularly in Baticaloa. The violin, viola, acoustic guitar and the tambourine are the accompanying instruments. 

Along with some rhythmic elements, the often light-hearted comical lyrics, deceptively philosophical and the wada (debate,) baila tradition appears to be uniquely Sri Lankan. The western coast, in particular Modara and Moratuwa-Galkissa regions, are the traditional abodes of the art of Wada-Baila. The viola, mandolin, rabana as well as the harmonium and tabla were used. The trumpet and military drums such as the snare and cymbals form part of the Papare bands popular throughout the coastal districts. In addition the tavil is used when accompanying religious processions such the Kataragama and the Devinuwara temple festival.

The popular Baila singer Wally Bastiansz, who introduced the chorus to the traditional baila, is referred to as the &quot;Father of Baila in Sri Lanka&quot;. There is a popular Baila song by Saman de Silva in tribute to him. M.S. Fernando A.K.A. &quot;Baila Chakrawarthi&quot; was a key figure in Sri Lankan Baila history between the 1950s and 1980s. Nithi Kanagaratnam started Baila&#x27;s in Tamil in 1967 and was also the key figures in the development of the genre.

==Contemporary song==
Today, this &quot;kaffirhina&quot; style (often referred to by its &quot;6/8&quot; time) has been adapted from violin, bongo drums and mandolin to accommodate modern instruments — specifically the electric guitar and synthesiser/workstation keyboards, octapad, bass guitar and drum kit. Due in part to this evolution, it is most often heard during parties, school reunions, charity dinner dances, hotel concerts and weddings. Contemporary Baila is also characterized by comical lyrics, often loosely adapted from themes derived from Sri Lanka&#x27;s history and/or folklore.

There are four subgenres of Baila:

* Chorus song: typical Baila song.
* Waada song: this is a contest between several Baila singers, often spontaneous. Judges give them a topic and competitors must compose their own lyrics for the specific Baila rhythm. Marks are given in different criteria including quick-wittedness, meaningfulness, flow and rhyme.
* Papare Baila: instrumental baila usually played outdoors using trumpets and drums influenced by marching bands. Popular in carnivals and cricket matches, the crowd joins in by singing and dancing.
* Calypso baila: influenced by Calypso music, played typically with acoustic guitars and bongo drums.
* Bailatronic: introduced by Ranidu Lankage, by mixing baila and electronic music together.

Popular Baila artists include: M. S. Fernando, Anton Jones, Paul Fernando, Desmond de Silva, Nihal Nelson, Maxwell Mendis, Sunil Perera (The Gypsies), Saman De Silva, Dhanapala Udawaththa, Rajiv Sebastian, Claude de Zoysa, Mariazelle Goonetilleke, Nithi Kanagaratnam, A. E. Manoharan, and Dalreen among others.

Baila has also influenced the music of many popular artists such as: Annesley Malewana, Clarence Wijewardene, C.T. Fernando, Anil Bharathi, Christopher Paul, Priya Peiris La Bambas, Super Golden Chimes, Los Flamingos, Sunflowers (band), The Gypsies, and even Pandit W. D. Amaradeva.

Moratuwa has produced a large number of these artists and is often referred to as the unofficial home of Baila. Gerald Wickremesooriya and his Sooriya records played a significant role to promote this genre of music. Radio broadcaster Vernon Corea promoted Baila music in the English-speaking world via the English-language programmes aired on Radio Ceylon and BBC Radio London during the late 1960s and 1970s. The Roshan Fernando foundation is a charity committed to the welfare of baila and other musicians.

In December 2006 a nonstop dance CD with the greatest Baila hits titled &quot;Sri Lankan Open House Party&quot; was released in Sri Lanka. The music was directed by renowned composer Suresh Maliyadde while the music on the CD was provided by Niresh Perera (The Gypsies) on drums, Mahinda Bandara Fortunes) on guitar, Tilak Dias on bass, Tissasiri Perera on keyboard, and Visharadha Monaj Pieris on percussion. Singers who were empowering these all time evergreens are Kanishka Wijetunga, Ganesha Wijetunga, Mariazelle Goonetilleke, and Suresh Maliyadde.

There are Baila songs in Tamil, which were popularized by Nithi Kanagaratnam, Stany Sivananthan, Tobel Ragal, Kanapathipillai, Emanuel, S Ramachandran, Ceylon Manohar (A.E.Manoharan), M.P.Paramesh, Amuthan Annamalai, et al.

The Sinhala Baila song &quot;Pissu Vikare (Dagena Polkatu Male)&quot; by H. R. Jothipala, Milton Perera, M. S. Fernando is a cover version of the Tamil song &quot;Dingiri Dingale (Meenachi)&quot; from the 1958 Tamil film &quot;Anbu Engey&quot;. And it was covered again in Sinhala as a folk song named &quot;Digisi/Digiri Digare (Kussiye Badu)&quot;.

<doc id="1073054" wikidata="Q3288554" url="?curid=1073054" title="Punji stick">
<text>The punji stick or punji stake is a type of booby trapped stake. It is a simple spike, made out of wood or bamboo, which is sharpened, heated, and usually set in a hole. Punji sticks are usually deployed in substantial numbers. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (third edition, 2007) lists less frequent, earlier spellings for &quot;punji stake (or stick)&quot;: panja, panjee, panjie, panji, and punge.

==Description==

Punji sticks would be placed in areas likely to be passed through by enemy troops. The presence of punji sticks may be camouflaged by natural undergrowth, crops, grass, brush or similar materials. They were often incorporated into various types of traps; for example, a camouflaged pit into which a soldier might fall (it would then be a trou de loup).

Sometimes a pit would be dug with punji sticks in the sides pointing &quot;downward&quot; at an angle. A soldier stepping into the pit would find it impossible to remove their leg without doing severe damage, and injuries might be incurred by the simple act of falling forward while one&#x27;s leg is in a narrow, vertical, stake-lined pit. Such pits would require time and care to dig the soldier&#x27;s leg out, immobilizing the unit longer than if the foot were simply pierced, in which case the victim could be evacuated by stretcher or fireman&#x27;s carry if necessary.

Other additional measures include coating the sticks in poison from plants, animal venom, or even human feces, causing infection or poisoning in the victim after being pierced by the sticks, even if the injury itself was not life-threatening.

Punji sticks were sometimes deployed in the preparation of an ambush. Soldiers lying in wait for the enemy to pass would deploy punji sticks in the areas where the surprised enemy might be expected to take cover, resulting in soldiers diving for cover potentially impaling themselves.

The point of penetration was usually in the foot or lower leg area. Punji sticks were not necessarily meant to kill the person who stepped on them; rather, they were sometimes designed specifically to only wound the enemy and slow or halt their unit while the victim was evacuated to a medical facility.

==Vietnam War==
In the Vietnam War, this method was used to force wounded soldiers to be transported by helicopter to a medical hospital for treatment.

Punji sticks were also used in Vietnam to complement various defenses, such as barbed wire.

==Etymology==
The term first appeared in the English language in the 1870s, after the British Indian Army encountered the sticks in their border conflicts against the Kachins of northeast Burma (and it is from the Tibeto-Burman language that this word probably originated).

<doc id="1073056" wikidata="Q7416624" url="?curid=1073056" title="Sandra Goudie">
<text>Sandra Anne Goudie (born 1952) is a New Zealand politician. She was the mayor of Thames-Coromandel from 2016 to 2022 when she resigned. She was the Member of Parliament for the Coromandel electorate from 2002 to 2011, representing the National Party. During the COVID-19 pandemic she was criticised for her anti-vaccination stance.

==Early years==
Goudie was a dairy farmer before entering politics. She was elected to the Thames-Coromandel District Council in 1998, and held that role until 2003.

==Member of Parliament==

Goudie was elected to Parliament in the 2002 election, narrowly winning the seat of Coromandel by defeating Labour candidate Max Purnell and pushing incumbent Green MP Jeanette Fitzsimons into third place.

Goudie was re-elected in the 2005 election with a 9700 vote majority. The day after the election, Goudie participated in a protest clearing mangroves in the Whangamata Harbour against environmental regulations.

Goudie retained her seat in the 2008 election, with a majority of 14,560. During the 2008 term, Goudie was the National Party&#x27;s opposition spokesperson on Internal Affairs, Senior Citizens and Associate Local Government until 2008.

She retired from parliament at the 2011 general election, citing the need to spend more time with her family. She was succeeded by Scott Simpson.

In 2012 Goudie left the National Party and joined Focus NZ, a small rural-based political party which subsequently deregistered in 2016.

==Local government==
At the 2016 local elections, Goudie was elected as the mayor of Thames-Coromandel, with a 498-vote majority. Goudie was re-elected at the 2019 local elections, increasing her majority to 7560. In 2022, she did not seek re-election, and was succeeded as mayor by Len Salt.

===Vaccination controversy===
In August 2021 a person infected with COVID-19 visited the Coromandel, prompting concern that there could be community transmission of the virus. Goudie attracted media attention when she said that she did not normally use the NZ COVID Tracer app and that the outbreak would probably not encourage her to scan more often. She later said that had been a throwaway remark, that she had been complacent about using the app, but that she would now use the COVID tracer app and urged everyone to do so.

In October 2021 Goudie received media attention when she said that she was not vaccinated, and would not take the Pfizer vaccine, saying that she would instead wait for the Novavax vaccine to be approved in New Zealand. She did not give reasons for this, but public health academic Siouxsie Wiles said that Goudie&#x27;s actions were &quot;putting others in danger.&quot;
She was criticised by COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins in a media conference. Despite her stance on the Pfizer vaccine, Goudie and the Thames-Coromandel District Council voted unanimously to support the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in October 2021.

In December, Thames-Coromandel councillor Gary Gotlieb lodged a complaint against Goudie due to her COVID-19 vaccination stance and for speaking to an Australian anti-vaccination group called Reignite Democracy Australia on 11 November. The Thames-Coromandel District Council decided not to proceed with the investigation, opting to resolve the issue informally.

In February 2022, after Novavax was approved in New Zealand, Goudie said that she would not take it despite her earlier statements. Goudie stood by her decision in early March 2022.

===Climate change controversy===
In 2019, Goudie refused to confirm whether she believed climate change was happening, and refused to sign the Local Government Leaders&#x27; Climate Change Declaration. 

In February 2022 she was still refusing to sign the Declaration, despite a majority of councillors on the Thames Coromandel District Council endorsing it. 

In March 2022 the Declaration was signed on behalf of Thames Coromandel District Council by another councillor, with Mayor Goudie being the only vote against doing so. 

In May 2022, Goudie announced that she would be retiring at the October 2022 election.

<text>Margaret Ann Hartley (née Thompson; 23 September 1942 – 20 December 2024) was a New Zealand politician. She was a Labour member of parliament between 1999 and 2008, and served as the mayor of North Shore City from 1989 to 1992.

==Early life and education==
Margaret Ann Thompson was born in Warkworth on 23 September 1942, the daughter of June Margaret and William Forsyth Thompson. She was educated at Orewa District High School from 1956 to 1960.

==Career==

===Early career===
From 1966 to 1975, Hartley was a full-time mother. In the early 1980s, she worked for the Mental Health Foundation and later managed the Child Abuse Prevention Centre. From 1980 to 1986, she was a member of the Birkenhead City Council, a member of the Child Abuse Prevention Society from 1983 to 1986 and a member of the Auckland Education Board from 1984 to 1989. In the 1990s, she worked as a real estate agent.

===Mayoralties===

From 1986, Hartley was the mayor of Birkenhead City, which in 1989 was absorbed into the newly created North Shore City as part of the 1989 New Zealand local government reforms. Birkenhead along with several other councils attempted legal action in February 1989 to prevent the amalgamations, which they argued would not serve residents best interests. After a months long campaign attempting to convince more councils to join the action eventually they decided to drop the case after receiving legal advice. The amalgamation went through and Hartley was elected mayor of the new North Shore City. She was defeated after one term, but tried to win the role back in 1998. Her attempt was unsuccessful.

===Member of Parliament===


She unsuccessfully contested the Birkenhead electorate in the , coming second to National&#x27;s Ian Revell. She unsuccessfully contested the electorate in the , again coming second to Revell. As she was ranked 47th on Labour&#x27;s party list in this first MMP election, she did not enter Parliament as a list MP either.

She was first elected to Parliament in the , winning the Northcote electorate. She was re-elected for Northcote in , but in was defeated by Jonathan Coleman. She remained in Parliament as a list member. In Parliament, she served on the Local Government and Environment Committee, Health Committee, and Justice and Electoral Committee, among others. With her prior experiences in local government, Hartley focused on legislative efforts including funding infrastructure improvements at a local level and early childhood education programs. As a member of the Health Committee, she was involved with the passage of legislation in 2003 for smoke-free environments in public places such as restaurants, while Steve Chadwick was chair of that committee. During her time on the Justice and Electoral Committee, she was involved in legislation related to victims&#x27; rights, as well as the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which amended the Crimes Act 1961 to remove &quot;reasonable force&quot; as a legal defence for parents accused of assaulting their children.

Hartley served as the Deputy Speaker of the House in the 47th New Zealand Parliament and the Assistant Speaker from the 2005 general election until her retirement from national politics in February 2008. She was replaced by former environment minister Marian Hobbs as Assistant Speaker and by Louisa Wall as Labour list MP.

===Later activities===

In the 2007 local body elections Hartley was elected to the North Shore City Council, and left Parliament in 2008 after the summer recess. 

At the 2010 local government elections, when the North Shore City Council (along with all the other councils in the Auckland region) was amalgamated into the single Auckland Council, she stood for the North Shore Ward under the Shore Voice ticket and was successful. She started her new role when the council came into existence on 1 November 2010. As part of the Auckland Council, she was involved with improving waterfront access in Takapuna and Mairangi Bay, by buying mansions that were converted into public parks. She played a role in improving public green spaces and events centres in the city, such as Kauri Point Centennial Park and the Bruce Mason Centre. Hartley was not re-elected at the 2013 Auckland Council election where she placed third running for re-election to one of the two seats in the North Shore Ward.

Hartley was elected to the Kaipātiki Local Board at the 2016 Auckland elections. She was reelected in 2019, and stepped down at the 2022 elections.

==Personal life and death==
In about 1962, she married Maurice Hartley, and the couple went on to have two children. Maurice Hartley died in 2022.

Hartley died in Auckland on 20 December 2024, at the age of 82.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Hartley was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. She was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to local government and the community.

<doc id="1073069" wikidata="Q1606613" url="?curid=1073069" title="Harry Cust">
<text>Henry John Cockayne-Cust, JP, DL (10 October 1861 – 2 March 1917) was an English politician and editor who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Unionist Party.

==Origins==
He was a son of Henry Cockayne-Cust, a younger grandson of Brownlow Cust, 1st Baron Brownlow, of Belton House near Grantham in Lincolnshire, by his wife Sara Jane Cookson.

==Career==
Cust received his education at Eton College where he served as captain of the Oppidans. He later attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and second-class honours in the Classical Tripos. Cust initially pursued a career in law and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1888, but he ultimately decided to enter politics. He won a by-election for Stamford, Lincolnshire in 1890 and served in Parliament until the general election of 1895. He later won a seat in the constituency of Bermondsey in Surrey in 1900 and served until 1906. During this time, he also served as a Justice of the Peace for Bedfordshire and Lincolnshire, as well as Deputy Lieutenant of Bedfordshire.

Cust was a member of The Souls, a prominent social group in late-Victorian England. He was romantically involved with Pamela Wyndham, who later married Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner. Other members of the group included Margot Asquith, Arthur Balfour, George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon, Alfred Lyttelton, Godfrey Webb, and George Wyndham. Cust was known for his exceptional conversational skills and had a reputation as a womanizer. He was also rumored to be the biological father of Lady Diana Cooper, a socialite and philanthropist, by his mistress Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland, although this was not acknowledged until much later. There were also rumors that he may have been the biological grandfather of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, through his supposed illegitimate begetting of her mother Beatrice Ethel Stephenson. Although there was no solid proof of this connection, Lady Diana Cooper often jokingly referred to Mrs Thatcher as her niece.

In 1892, Cust was invited by William Waldorf Astor to edit the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, despite having no prior experience in journalism. Cust quickly transformed the newspaper into the best evening journal of the period, largely due to his success in securing contributions from prominent writers such as Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. However, Cust rejected contributions submitted by Astor himself, who had literary aspirations. This, along with political disagreements, led to Cust&#x27;s dismissal in February 1896.

After leaving the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, Cust continued his career as an author, writing several poems including &quot;Non nobis&quot;. During World War I, Cust was active in propaganda efforts on behalf of the British Government. In August 1914, he founded the Central Committee for National Patriotic Organizations.

==Death==
He died in 1917 of a heart attack at his home in Hyde Park Gate, London. As the most senior male relative of his childless second cousin Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow, 3rd Viscount Alford, 4th Baron Brownlow, 7th Baronet (1844–1921), he had been the heir presumptive to the barony of Brownlow, the Cust baronetcy and to the extensive Cust estates centred on Belton House. However, as he predeceased the 3rd Earl by three years, the inheritance fell to his surviving younger brother Adelbert Cockayne-Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow, 8th Baronet (1867–1927).

A detailed look at Cust&#x27;s life is found in Tangled Souls: Love and Scandal among the Victorian Aristocracy by Jane Dismore (see Further Reading).

==Marriage==
As the result of a purported pregnancy, he married on 11 October 1893 Emmeline Mary Elizabeth Welby-Gregory (1867 – 29 September 1955), known as Nina, a daughter of Sir William Welby-Gregory, 4th Baronet by his wife Victoria Stuart-Wortley. The pregnancy was either false or a misrepresentation, and the couple, whose marriage was thereafter contentious, did not have any children. Nina Cust was an artist and a translator and editor of her mother&#x27;s papers. She and her husband are buried together at St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Belton in an elaborate white marble monument with a recumbent effigy of Harry Cust, sculpted by her. Nina and Harry&#x27;s relationship is at the centre of the book Tangled Souls: Love and Scandal among the Victorian Aristocracy by Jane Dismore (see Further Reading).

===Illegitimate descendants===
====Lady Diana Cooper====
His best-known lovechild was the socialite Lady Diana Cooper (1892-1986), legally the daughter of Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland. Internationally famous for her beauty, she married the politician Duff Cooper in 1919.

====Lady Thatcher (rumoured)====
A long-standing rumour has held that Cust had an affair with a servant at Belton House called Phoebe Stephenson, who consequently gave birth to a daughter named Beatrice, who having married Alfred Roberts, a grocer in nearby Grantham, became the mother of Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In the 1980s, the very elderly Diana Cooper referred to Thatcher as &quot;my niece, the Prime Minister&quot;.

====Others====
Anita Leslie, in her book &quot;Marlborough House Set&quot;, implies that Cust had many more children by aristocratic mistresses: Leslie writes—
So much of the Cust strain entered England&#x27;s peerage that from such a number of cradles there gazed babies with eyes like large sapphires instead of the black boot buttons of their legal fathers.

==Legacy==
* An annual Cust Lecture &quot;on some important current topic relating to the British Empire&quot; was endowed in the University of Nottingham to commemorate his work.
* His &quot;Occasional Poems&quot; appeared in 1918, printed in Jerusalem.

<text>George Warren Hawkins (born 1946) is a New Zealand local government politician and former Labour Party Member of Parliament.

Hawkins held public office for 36 years. He was Mayor of Papakura from 1983 to 1992, the Member of Parliament for Manurewa from 1990 to 2011, and a member on the Manurewa and Papakura local boards from 2010 to 2019. Between 1999 and 2005, he served as Minister of Police, Minister of Civil Defence, Minister of Internal Affairs, and Minister of Ethnic Affairs in the Fifth Labour Government.

==Early life and family ==
Hawkins was born on 15 May 1946 in the Auckland suburb of Mt Eden. He has two brothers.

He attended Dominion Road Primary School, Mount Albert Grammar School (1960–1963) and then Auckland Teachers&#x27; College. Before entering politics, he was an art teacher at Rosehill College and had also been a photographer for the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; newspaper. He later became a company director.

Hawkins met his wife, Jan, at teacher&#x27;s college. They have two sons. The eldest, also named George Hawkins, is an elected member on the Papakura Local Board. Their youngest son died in an accident in 1989.

== Early political career ==
In the 1970s Hawkins became an anti-nuclear activist and he joined the Labour Party. He became chair of Labour&#x27;s Papakura branch. In early 1977 he stood as a candidate for the Labour Party nomination in the Mangere by-election, but he lost out to future prime minister David Lange. Later that year Hawkins stood for the nomination for the nearby seat of , but was again unsuccessful.

Alongside Geoff Braybrooke, Hawkins unsuccessfully contested a seat on the Papakura City Council in 1974. He tried again in 1977 and in a by-election thereafter, but was not successful until the 1980 election.

== Mayor of Papakura ==
After a three-year term as a councillor, Hawkins was elected Mayor of Papakura in 1983. He was elected unopposed to his third term as mayor, of the enlarged Papakura district, in 1989, and was succeeded by his brother, David, in 1992.

As mayor, Hawkins advocated for a toll free telephone exchange between South Auckland and Auckland City. While he was a supporter of the fluoridation of water, he voted to remove fluoride from the Papakura water supply in 1987 in line with the outcome of a community referendum. In 1990, Hawkins instigated the building of a theatre in Papakura, later named the Hawkins Theatre.

== Member of Parliament ==




=== Opposition, 1990–1999 ===
In 1990 Hawkins was selected to succeed Roger Douglas as the Labour candidate for the seat of Manurewa, beating Alan Johnson, a town planner and opponent of Douglas. He served as MP for Manurewa from when he was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 general election until his retirement in 2011.

Hawkins was perceived to be among the right wing of the Labour Party. In his maiden statement, he praised Douglas and Michael Bassett, and the economic and local government reforms they oversaw during the previous administration. He also proposed the relocation of New Zealand&#x27;s parliament from Wellington to Auckland. Labour leader Mike Moore appointed Hawkins as the party&#x27;s spokesperson for local government and urban affairs; he was also assigned to the internal affairs and local government committee and the planning and development committee. Between 1993 and 1999, he was police spokesperson and sat on the justice and law reform committee.

Through the 1990s, he was aligned with Mike Moore and Phil Goff and was part of their attempted coup to relieve Helen Clark of the Labour leadership in 1996. With them, he formulated the Labour Party&#x27;s tougher law and order policies that were taken into the 1999 election, which included zero-tolerance policies proposing that district commanders be sacked if they fail to meet crime-reduction targets. As police spokesperson, Hawkins was critical of the development and cost overruns of the Integrated National Crime Information System (INCIS), which was eventually abandoned in 1999.

In July 1992 Hawkins was hospitalized suffering from an infection and exhaustion. While in hospital he suffered a pulmonary embolism, leading him to an extended convalescence. He later decided to retire from the Papakura mayoralty to ease his workload. During the period he suffered a stroke, which would leave him with a speech impediment. At the time Hawkins (and others) thought bad health would end his career. He continued on, however, stating &quot;But it [his condition] made me think that some things are really worth fighting for.&quot;

=== Minister in the Fifth Labour Government ===
Hawkins was appointed Minister of Police, Minister of Civil Defence, and Minister of Ethnic Affairs in December 1999. He was additionally appointed Minister of Internal Affairs in November 2000 and, in lieu of the ethnic affairs portfolio, Minister of Veterans&#x27; Affairs after the 2002 general election. Hawkins&#x27; tenure as minister ran through until after the 2005 general election, when he opted not to continue.

As police minister, Hawkins oversaw a crackdown on burglary. In 2000, he ordered police to respond to burglaries within 24 hours and introduced new legislation enabling police to conduct DNA testing of burglary suspects and collect fingerprints of children aged 10 and over without parental consent. The fingerprint proposal was criticised by Hawkins&#x27; colleague, junior minister Tariana Turia. Early reports indicated that the burglary policies were having some success despite not meeting the targets set, but violent crime continued to rise. Hawkins suggested that the rise in crime was an effect of the previous government&#x27;s stricter social welfare policies. In 2001 Hawkins appointed the first woman and first civilian deputy police commissioner, Lyn Provost. In 2002, amid a shortage of police in Auckland, he announced plans to hire civilians to respond to burglaries.

Hawkins was also criticised for being too involved in police operations, which are supposed to be independent of politicians, including for suggesting police trainees pay their own way, banning police officers from carrying cell phones, giving directions on the investigation into the murders of Ben Smart and Olivia Hope, and determining what colours to paint police cars. A new police amendment bill proposed the police minister to have greater powers of direction over the police commissioner. Police association president Greg O&#x27;Connor described the bill as &quot;compromising the ability of police to act independently.&quot; The bill was eventually abandoned.

Hawkins received responsibility for citizenship as associate internal affairs minister in July 2000 and was assigned the full portfolio that November. The reshuffle gave him responsibility for the New Zealand Fire Service, in addition to the police and civil defence. He initiated a review of the fire service in 2004, which had been described as &quot;financially ailing&quot; with a $100m funding shortfall in 2001. Hawkins was also responsible for gambling and building regulations. He was seen as &quot;pro-gaming&quot; but progressed government policy to prevent the building of any new casinos in New Zealand and established a new Gambling Commission. Despite initially obfuscating on the issue, he commissioned an inquiry into the leaky homes crisis in September 2002 and established a mediation service for victims of the crisis in October 2002. When it was revealed he had known about the crisis for several months before taking any action, there were calls for his resignation; eventually responsibility for the issue was reassigned to the commerce minister, Lianne Dalziel.

Hawkins also came under further pressure in the police portfolio in 2004 and 2005 when issues with the police 111 telephone system were reported, when senior officers were accused of sexual misconduct, and when large amounts of pornography were discovered on police hard drives. Ahead of the 2005 general election, Hawkins—despite being the 11th-ranked cabinet minister—was placed 25th on the Labour Party list in what was described as a &quot;clear message&quot; about his future with the party after the election. In response, Hawkins withdrew his name from the party list, won his Manurewa electorate by a 12,000-vote margin, and proactively ended his ministerial career by issuing a post-election statement that he would not accept reappointment as a minister.

=== Later parliamentary career ===
After withdrawing from the ministry in 2005, Hawkins became a backbencher, sitting on the finance and expenditure committee, the government administration committee, and the social services committee. Audrey Young of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Hawkins was regarded by colleagues as a quiet maverick, asking written questions of ministers in the same manner that Opposition MPs would do.

In June 2008, Hawkins introduced the Sale of Liquor (Objections to Applications) Amendment Bill. The bill aimed to address over-consumption of alcohol by enabling communities to challenge liquor licensing applications. Hawkins was successful in having the bill introduced into Parliament without a ballot, and it was referred to the social services committee on 2 July 2008. The bill returned to the House for its second reading in 2010, where it was defeated when the government preferred to consider that proposal in its own alcohol reform bill. Speaking on the bill, Hawkins said he had changed his position on alcohol over his career and, having voted for the alcohol purchase age to be 18 in 1999, would instead vote for the age to be 20.

Hawkins twice, in 2005 and 2010, introduced legislation on behalf of Manukau City Council (later Auckland Council) to more strongly regulate street prostitution within its district. Both bills were defeated, with the select committee that considered the second bill determining that it was not required because councils could already create by-laws related to prostitution.

Calls for Hawkins to retire continued after he left the ministry. These intensified in 2007 when Hawkins took two months off to have an operation for bowel cancer. He believed many in the Labour Party coveted his safe electorate seat and stated of many of the visitors he received in hospital: &quot;They didn&#x27;t want to hold your hand, they wanted to take your pulse.&quot; With Daniel Newman, who worked in his local office, Hawkins lobbied to make boundary changes ahead of the 2008 general election that were intended to improve his already strong majority in Manurewa. The changes also made the nearby seats of Botany and Papakura safer for the National Party. At the election, Hawkins&#x27; majority was cut by more than half.

Following the defeat of the Labour government in 2008, Hawkins was appointed housing spokesperson by Clark&#x27;s successor as leader, Phil Goff. In a 2009 reshuffle, he was reassigned to the local government portfolio. In the 2008–2011 term, Hawkins sat as a member of the primary production committee, the local government and environment committee, and the Auckland governance legislation committee.

In 2010, Hawkins announced his run for a seat on the new Manurewa Local Board and said if he was successful he would resign from Parliament. After winning the seat, he refused to say whether he would force a by-election or simply retire at the 2011 general election. Hawkins threatened to call a by-election if an EPMU-backed candidate was selected over his preferred successor. Initially, Hawkins favoured Labour list MP Shane Jones but later gave his allegiance to his former advisor Ian Dunwoodie. In the end, Louisa Wall won the nomination with Hawkins&#x27; blessing and he retired from Parliament at the election, giving his valedictory statement on 29 September 2011.

== Local board member ==
In 2010 Hawkins returned to local government when he was elected a member of the Manurewa Local Board on the Manurewa Action Team ticket. He won a second term at the 2013 local elections before changing to Papakura Action Team ticket to successfully contest the Papakura Local Board in 2016. He retired in 2019 and was succeeded on the board by his son, George Hawkins.

==Honours and awards==

On 15 December 2005, Hawkins was granted retention of the title &quot;The Honourable&quot;, in recognition of his term as a member of the Executive Council.

In the 2013 New Year Honours, Hawkins was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for services as a member of Parliament.

<text>: &quot;For the British statesman, see George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston.&quot;
Commander Chambré George William Penn Curzon (18 October 1898 – 7 May 1976), known as George Curzon, was a Royal Navy commander, actor, and father of the present Earl Howe.

Curzon, born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England, was the only son of diplomat the Hon. Frederick Curzon-Howe (a son of the 3rd Earl Howe) and his wife, the actress Ellis Jeffreys. Curzon trained for the Navy at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, on the Isle of Wight, and first saw action in the First World War. He retired from the Navy as a lieutenant commander, then served as a King&#x27;s Messenger before turning to the West End stage in 1930.

Curzon then went to America and appeared on the New York stage in the play &quot;Parnell&quot; before entering films. He was given a minor role as a police constable in Basil Dean&#x27;s &quot;Escape&quot; (1930). His first major role came in 1935 when he appeared as the title role in &quot;Sexton Blake and the Bearded Doctor&quot;. He reprised this role in &quot;Sexton Blake and the Mademoiselle&quot; (1935) and &quot;Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror&quot; (1938). He appeared in several films directed by Alfred Hitchcock before he moved to the United States and Hollywood, most notably &quot;Young and Innocent&quot;, where he played a musician and murderer who was caught by his nervous eye-twitch, in a famous long crane shot devised by Hitchcock.

A brief interruption came to Curzon&#x27;s acting career in 1939 when, after playing a minor role in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, he again enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He later starred in various other films from 1947 until 1965.

Curzon had two children from his second marriage, Frederick Richard Penn (born 1951) and Emma Charlotte (born 1953). His son succeeded to his kinsman&#x27;s title of Earl Howe in 1984 (eight years after the death of Curzon himself in 1976) and his daughter was granted the rank of an earl&#x27;s daughter a year later (i.e. Lady Emma).

<text>Felix Adler (August 13, 1851 – April 24, 1933) was a German-American professor of political and social ethics, rationalist, influential lecturer on euthanasia, religious leader and social reformer who founded the Ethical Culture movement.

== Early life ==
Felix Adler was born in Alzey, Rhenish Hesse, Grand Duchy of Hesse, Germany, the son of a rabbi, Samuel Adler, a leading figure in European Reform Judaism, and Henrietta Frankfurter. The family immigrated to the United States from Germany when Felix was six years old so that his father could accept the appointment as head rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in New York.

Adler attended Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School and graduated from Columbia University in 1870 with honors. He continued at Heidelberg University where he studied as part of his training to become a rabbi. He received a PhD from Heidelberg in 1873. While in Germany, he was strongly influenced by neo-Kantianism, especially the notions that one cannot prove or disprove the existence of a deity or immortality, and that morality can be established independently of theology.

== Academic career ==
When Adler returned to New York at the age of twenty-three, he was asked to give a sermon at Temple Emanu-El, where he was meant to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as rabbi of the congregation. His sermon, &quot;The Judaism of the Future&quot;, shocked the congregation, as he did not once mention God. Adler introduced his concept of Judaism as a universal religion of morality for all of humankind. The sermon was his first and last at Temple Emanu-El.

In 1874, after it had become clear that he would not become a rabbi, members of his father&#x27;s congregation helped Adler gain a teaching position at Cornell University as a nonresident Professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature. He was popular with his students, with whom he discussed his novel religious ideas while illuminating contemporary labor struggles and power politics. He was attacked as an atheist for his views, and in 1876 Cornell declined to accept the grant that had paid Adler&#x27;s salary. In 1902 Adler was given the chair of political and social ethics at Columbia University, where he taught until his death in 1933. There he opposed the formation of a Zionist student club, considering it to be a &quot;divisive force&quot;.

== New York Society of Ethical Culture ==
In 1876, Adler, at age 26, was invited to give a lecture expanding upon his themes first presented in the sermon at Temple Emanu-El. On May 15, 1876, he reiterated the need for a religion that united all humankind in moral and social action without the trappings of ritual or creed. To do away with theology and to unite theists, atheists, agnostics and deists, all in the same religious cause, was a revolutionary idea at the time. A few weeks after the sermon, Adler started a series of weekly Sunday lectures. In February 1877, aided by Joseph Seligman, president of Temple Emanu-El, Adler incorporated the Society of Ethical Culture.

Adler talked about &quot;deed, not creed&quot;; he believed good works were the basis of ethical culture. In 1877, the Society founded the District Nursing Department, which organized a team of nurses who visited the homebound sick in poor districts. A year later, in 1878, the Society established a free kindergarten for working people&#x27;s children. Because it served the working poor, the kindergarten provided basic necessities for the children when needed, such as clothing and hot meals. It evolved into the Ethical Culture Fieldston School.

Well-known as a lecturer and writer, Adler served as a rector for the Ethical Culture School until his death in 1933. Throughout his life, he always looked beyond the immediate concerns of family, labor, and race to the long-term challenge of reconstructing institutions, such as schools and government, to promote greater justice in human relations. Cooperation rather than competition was the higher social value. He gave a series of six lectures on &quot;The Ethics of Marriage&quot; for the Lowell Institute&#x27;s 1896–1897 season.

Adler was the founding chairman of the National Child Labor Committee in 1904. Lewis Hine was hired as the committee&#x27;s photographer in 1908. In 1917, Adler served on the Civil Liberties Bureau, which later became the American Civil Liberties Bureau and then the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). In 1928, he became president of the Eastern division of the American Philosophical Association. He served on the first executive board of the National Urban League.

== Tenement house reform ==
As a member of the New York State Tenement House Commission, Adler was concerned not only with overcrowding but also by the increase in contagious disease caused by overcrowding. Though not a proponent of free public housing, Adler spoke out about tenement reform and the rents, which he considered exorbitant. Jacob Riis wrote that Adler had &quot;clear incisive questions that went through all subterfuges to the root of things.&quot;

In 1885 Adler and others created the Tenement House Building Company in order to build &quot;model&quot; affordable tenements; they rented for $8–$14/month. By 1887 the company had completed six model buildings on the Lower East Side of Manhattan for the sum of $155,000. Critics favored legislation and regulations to improve tenement conditions, but the model tenement was a progressive step.

== American foreign policy ==
By the late 1890s, with the increase in international conflicts, Adler switched his concern from domestic issues to the question of American foreign policy. While some contemporaries viewed the 1898 Spanish–American War as an act to liberate the Cubans from Spanish rule, others perceived the U.S. victories in the Caribbean and the Philippines as the beginning of an expansionist empire. Adler at first supported the war but later expressed concern about American sovereignty over the Philippines and Puerto Rico. He believed that an imperialistic rather than a democratic goal was guiding U.S. foreign policy. Ethical Culture affirms &quot;the supreme worth of the person&quot;, and Adler superimposed this tenet on international relations, believing that no single group could lay claim to superior institutions and lifestyle.

Unlike many of his contemporaries during World War I, Adler did not believe that the defeat of the German Empire would make the world safe for democracy. He thought peace depended on representative democratic governments being non-imperialistic and their curbing the arms race. He opposed the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations. As an alternative, Adler proposed a &quot;Parliament of Parliaments&quot;, elected by the legislative bodies of the different nations and representing different classes of people, rather than special interests, so that common interests would prevail over national differences.

== Philosophy ==
Adler developed an original philosophy with a foundation in those of Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that developed and transformed these roots. He considered philosophy not just a guide of life but a key to improving society and the human condition appropriate to respect for essential human dignity. Rejecting Kant&#x27;s metaphysics, he embraced his stress on the intrinsic worth and dignity of the person. Combining a supreme moral principle similar to Kant&#x27;s with his detailed ideas of self-realization, he emphasized the free development of the individual about societal concerns and fellowship. He preceded John Dewey in a concern for the &quot;problems of men&quot; instead of philosophical technicalities. While his ideas shared some aspects of pragmatism, he was better described as &quot;an ethical idealist with great practical reforming zeal&quot; he promoted an idealist version of moral perfectionism. He was, however, realistic and not sentimental, acknowledging that man has done evil knowingly and deliberately.

Adler&#x27;s ethics combined an appeal to universal principles with moral particularism, which holds that the unique circumstances of a particular case must be carefully considered to determine the ethical choice in that case. Adler believed that moral laws could not be applied similarly to varied and unique individuals but that moral principles applied to all. He saw a need to balance essential general principles with consideration of the particular specific circumstances. He developed his own version of what he called Kant&#x27;s &quot;formula,&quot; which was, &quot;Treat every [person] as a spiritual means to thine own spiritual end and conversely.&quot;

He proposed a &quot;supreme ethical rule,&quot; which he stated as follows: &quot;So act as to elicit the unique personality in others, and thereby in thyself,&quot; or &quot;Act so as to elicit the best in others and thereby in thyself.&quot; He thought by doing so, one would transcend both egoism and altruism. He believed that virtue is and must be its reward, or else it is not. He characterized a virtuous act as one &quot;in which the ends of self and of the other are respected and promoted jointly,&quot; coordinating Kantian universalistic imperative ethics with a type of perfectionism. He took ethics seriously and felt it &quot;must run like a golden thread through the whole of a [person&#x27;s] life.&quot; He felt consequentialism, particularly utilitarianism, was inappropriate in ethics as it attempts to apply quantitative measures to something of a qualitative nature.

Adler&#x27;s social philosophy opposed commercialism. He claimed, &quot;The root disease that afflicts the world at the present day is the supremacy of the commercial point of view.&quot; His thought prized public works and the use of reason to develop ultimate ethical standards. Adler published such works as &quot;Creed and Deed&quot; (1878), &quot;Moral Instruction of Children&quot; (1892), &quot;Life and Destiny&quot; (1905), &quot;The Religion of Duty&quot; (1906), &quot;Essentials of Spirituality&quot; (1908), &quot;An Ethical Philosophy of Life&quot; (1918), &quot;The Reconstruction of the Spiritual Ideal&quot; (1925), and &quot;Our Part in this World.&quot; He made use of ideas from Judaism, as well as the philosophies of Kant and Ralph Waldo Emerson, mixed with specific socialist ideas of his time. He believed that the concept of a personal god was unnecessary and thought that the human personality was the central force of religion. He believed that different people&#x27;s interpretations of religions were to be respected as religious in themselves. The Ethical Culture movement was open to people of diverse beliefs. Ethical Culture societies were formed in the late nineteenth century in numerous cities in the United States, for instance, Philadelphia and St. Louis.

<text>Philip Reeve Heatley (born 5 April 1967) is a New Zealand politician. He is a member of the National Party. From 2008 until January 2013, he was a member of cabinet, holding the portfolios of Fisheries, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Energy and Resources, and Housing, before being replaced in a cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister John Key. Heatley retired from Parliament in 2014.

==Early years==
Heatley was born in Whangārei. Before entering politics, Heatley completed a master&#x27;s degree with Honours in Horticultural Engineering at Massey University. He has undertaken short-term study and work as a volunteer with an international relief agency on a hospital ship. He was an agricultural engineer in the dairy industry, surveying and designing farm buildings, land drainage and irrigation systems. He authored two published environmental engineering manuals. He is currently a Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ).

==Member of Parliament==



From the 1999 election until his retirement at the , he was the MP for the electorate. In Opposition, Heatley was a member of Parliament&#x27;s Primary Production Committee, Regulations Review Committee and Transport and Industrial Relations Committee and has been National&#x27;s spokesman on Forestry, Fisheries, Regional Development, Early Childhood Education and Energy.

He became Minister of Housing and Minister of Fisheries in the Fifth National Government in 2008 and remained Minister of Housing and became Minister of Energy and Resources in 2011, the beginning of the Government&#x27;s second term.

In 2009 he introduced the Unit Titles Bill, modernising the 1972 legislation that regulates the way apartment blocks and multi-unit developments are managed. The Act came into force in April 2010. He also introduced the Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill to update existing rental laws and extend them to cover tenants in boarding houses not previously having protection. The legislation was passed in 2010.

Following &#x27;errors&#x27; found in his expense reports, he resigned all portfolio positions in February 2010. He was reinstated to his ministerial portfolios the following month after a report which cleared him of any deliberate wrongdoing.

In 2011 he imposed change to the way Housing New Zealand delivered state housing including introducing a &#x27;reviewable tenancy&#x27; that put an end to a 70-year &#x27;state house for life&#x27; principle. A one-year suspension period to prevent anti-social tenants from reapplying for a state house, measures to prevent fraud and a commitment to insulate every state house and resource third sector providers of social housing also came into force.

Heatley&#x27;s fisheries portfolio role was renamed from April 2010. As Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, in 2010 Heatley introduced the Aquaculture Legislation Amendment Bill (No 3) to streamline consenting, help manage competing demand for coastal space, and to deliver on the Maori Commercial Aquaculture Settlement to iwi. The legislation was passed in 2011. Together with then Labour Minister, Kate Wilkinson, he initiated a Ministerial Inquiry into the operation of Foreign Charter Vessels (FCVs) in New Zealand&#x27;s EEZ. This followed allegations of the failure of some FCVs to provide for proper crew working conditions and vessel safety standards. Heatley, as Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, was succeeded by David Carter as Minister of Primary Industries following the 2011 post-election cabinet reshuffle. The inquiry was concluded in 2012 and the Fisheries (Foreign Charter Vessels and Other Matters) Bill was tabled later that year.

In December 2011 Heatley became Minister of Energy and Resources. In 2012 he introduced the Crown Minerals (Permitting and Crown Land) Bill amending the Crown Minerals Act 1991 to &#x27;promote&#x27;, not simply manage, exploration and production of oil, gas and mineral resources. The legislation created a two-tiered permit system for the more complex, higher-return petroleum and mineral activities and the lower-return small business and hobby mineral operations. Amendments were also included in response to the report of the Royal Commission on the Pike River Coal Mine disaster. The legislation was passed in 2013. In February 2012, he introduced a new &#x27;block offer&#x27; process for awarding oil and gas exploration permit areas across New Zealand, including in its EEZ. Blocks on offer are confirmed following consultation with iwi and local authorities and a competitive tender is undertaken to finally allocate permits. This replaced a &#x27;priority in time&#x27; process.

In 22 January 2013 Cabinet reshuffle, Heatley lost his ministerial portfolio Energy and Resources to Simon Bridges and Housing to Nick Smith.

==Post-ministerial career==
On 31 January 2013 Heatley was granted the right to retain the title of The Honourable for life in recognition of his term as a Member of the Executive Council of New Zealand.
Hon Phil Heatley was a member of the Parliament&#x27;s Social Services Committee (2013–2014) and its Local Government and Environment Committee (2013–2014). In early November 2013 he announced he would be retiring from politics at the 2014 general election to &quot;move on to fresh challenges and opportunities in the private sector&quot;. In September 2015 he joined the Northland Regional Council.

<doc id="1073082" wikidata="Q185037" url="?curid=1073082" title="Amarok (software)">
<text>Amarok is a free and open-source music player for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems. Amarok is part of the KDE project, but it is released independently of the central KDE Software Compilation release cycle. Amarok is released under the terms of the GPL-2.0-or-later.

== History ==
Amarok is one of the oldest Linux music players in active development, being started in 2003. The program was originally stylized as amaroK, after a Mike Oldfield album of the same name. The artwork references Amarok, a wolf in Inuit mythology. The app&#x27;s capitalization was changed to Amarok in June 2006.

A new major version of Amarok, version 2.0, was released on December 12, 2008. On June 3, 2009, version 2.1 was released, which reintroduced some of the 1.4 features which had been missing from the initial 2.0 release, and introduced some features such as native ReplayGain support.

Version 3.0 of Amarok was released in April 2024, after a six year hiatus of major updates. It ported the application to Qt5 and added support for FFmpeg 5, along with other smaller changes. A port to Qt6, the newest version of the Qt library, is scheduled for later in the year.

== Features ==
Amarok supports a wide variety of music formats due to the use of audio engines. It can retrieve cover art information and lyrics from the internet It includes a sidebar that displays the user&#x27;s music collection, saved playlists, and internet radio stations on the left and the active playlist on the right. Amarok can also display the Wikipedia entry for the band or album in the sidebar. Other features include dynamic playlists, bookmarking, file tracking, and smooth fade-out settings.

Amarok includes integration with online music services such as Last.fm, OPML Podcast, Jamendo, Magnatune, and Ampache.

Amarok can be used to manage music on iPods and other MP3 players.

== Notable forks ==
* Clementine is a fork of Amarok 1.4 that ported it to the Qt 4 framework.
* Strawberry is a fork of discontinued Clementine 1.4 with additional improvements and fixes.
* Exaile is a GTK+ fork of Amarok 1.4.

<text>The Couper Collection is an internationally exhibited collection of artwork and installations by the British artist Max Couper, as well as a venue for: exhibitions and events by other artists; and youth art education projects.

Based in Hove, Sussex since 2022, the Couper Collection for many years exhibited its art in a floating gallery on converted barges, moored on the banks of the Thames in Battersea, London.

Between 2001 and 2003 the Collection was a Focus Site of the London String of Pearls Golden Jubilee Festival, Patron Prince Charles.

The Couper Collection Diamond Jubilee Bridge was launched in a ceremony during the sailby of The Queen and The Prince of Wales during the 2012 Thames Jubilee Pageant.

==Works==
Major works by Max Couper and the Couper Collection include:

* Couper&#x27;s new artwork &amp; costumes at Galerie Verbeeck Van Dyke, Antwerp (2021)
* Couper Collection&#x27;s children&#x27;s art exhibitions with the National Portrait Gallery London (2002)
* Couper&#x27;s Thames Fleeting Opera with the Royal Opera House and Judi Dench (2000) 
* Couper&#x27;s exhibition at The Museum of Contemporary Art (MuHKA), Antwerp (1996)
* Couper&#x27;s exhibition at the Sprengel Museum, Hanover (1997)
* Couper&#x27;s exhibition at the Lehmbruck Museum of sculpture, Duisburg (1997)

==Challenged mooring rights &amp; closure 2014-2022==
In 2006, the Couper Collection was involved a dispute with Hutchison Whampoa and the Port of London Authority regarding a land claim at Albion Riverside and Foster and Partners&#x27;s plans to remove the charity&#x27;s barges. Foster&#x27;s lawyers, Farrer &amp; Co, put in objections to the UK Land Registry. Max Couper claimed &quot;ancient mooring rights&quot;, but in 2013 Justice Arnold ruled that the barges should be removed, and Hutchison Whampoa sought to enforce the ruling with a further High Court order to &quot;dispose of or destroy&quot; the gallery. The PLA offered alternative mooring sites, which Couper declined.

The litigation was long, and complex. Proceedings were first issued in 2006. The final judgement in the litigation was later in 2017, when Couper attempted to sue his solicitors and counsel in the earlier proceedings.

The vessels have been sold.

The Collection was re-incorporated in 2020 as a not-for-profit Community Interest Company (CIC). Registered as The Couper Collection Sussex CIC, its current directors in 2023 are Tim French MBE, Max Couper and Magdalena Couper.

<doc id="1073114" wikidata="Q312571" url="?curid=1073114" title="Johan Gadolin">
<text>Johan Gadolin (5 June 176015 August 1852) was a Finnish chemist, physicist and mineralogist. Gadolin discovered a &quot;new earth&quot; containing the first rare-earth compound yttrium, which was later determined to be a chemical element. He is also considered the founder of Finnish chemistry research, as the second holder of the Chair of Chemistry at the Royal Academy of Turku (or &quot;Åbo Kungliga Akademi&quot;). Gadolin was ennobled for his achievements and awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir and the Order of Saint Anna.

==Early life and education==
Johan Gadolin was born in Åbo (Finnish name Turku), Finland (then a part of Sweden). Johan was the son of Jakob Gadolin, professor of physics and theology at Åbo. Johan began to study mathematics at the Royal Academy of Turku (&quot;Åbo Kungliga Akademi&quot;) when he was fifteen. Later he changed his major to chemistry, studying with Pehr Adrian Gadd, the first chair of chemistry at Åbo.

In 1779 Gadolin moved to Uppsala University. In 1781, he published his dissertation &quot;Dissertatio chemica de analysi ferri&quot; (&quot;Chemical dissertation on the analysis of iron&quot;), under the direction of Torbern Bergman. Bergman founded an important research school, and many of his students, including Gadolin, Johan Gottlieb Gahn, and Carl Wilhelm Scheele, became close friends.

==Career==
Gadolin was fluent in Latin, Finnish, Russian, German, English and French in addition to his native Swedish. He was a candidate for the chair of chemistry at Uppsala in 1784, but Johann Afzelius was selected instead. Gadolin became an extraordinary professor at Åbo in 1785 (an unpaid position). Beginning in 1786, he made a chemical &quot;grand tour&quot; of Europe, visiting universities and mines in various countries. He worked with Lorenz Crell, editor of the journal &quot;Chemische Annalen&quot; in Germany, and with Adair Crawford and Richard Kirwan in Ireland.

Gadolin was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1790.

Gadolin became the ordinary professor of chemistry at the Royal Academy of Turku in 1797, after the death of Pehr Adrian Gadd. He retained the position until his retirement in 1822. He was one of the first chemists who gave laboratory exercises to students. He even allowed the students to use his private laboratory.

==Chemical achievements==
Gadolin made contributions in a variety of areas.

Although he never visited France, he became a proponent of Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s theory of combustion. Gadolin&#x27;s &quot;Inledning till Chemien&quot; (1798) was the first chemistry textbook in the Nordic countries that questioned the theory of phlogiston and discussed the role of oxygen in combustion in a modern way.

===Studies of heat===
Gadolin studied the relationship of heat to chemical changes, in particular, the ability of different substances to absorb heat (specific heat) and the absorption of heat during state changes (latent heat). This thermochemical work required extremely precise measurements. Gadolin published important papers on specific heat by 1784, and on the latent heat of steam in 1791. He demonstrated that the heat of ice was equal to the heat of snow, and published a standard set of heat tables.

===Yttrium, the first rare-earth element===
Gadolin became famous for his description of the first rare-earth element, yttrium. In 1792 Gadolin received a sample of black, heavy mineral found in a quarry in a Swedish village Ytterby near Stockholm by Carl Axel Arrhenius. By careful experiments, Gadolin determined that approximately 38% of the sample was a previously unknown &quot;earth&quot;, an oxide which was later named yttria. Yttria, or yttrium oxide, was the first known rare-earth metal compound—at that time, it was not yet regarded as an element in the modern sense. His work was published in 1794.

The mineral that Gadolin examined was named gadolinite in 1800. The element gadolinium and its oxide gadolinia were named after Gadolin by its discoverers.

In an earlier paper in 1788 Gadolin showed that the same element can show several oxidation states, in his case Sn(II) and Sn(IV) &#x27;by combining itself with larger or smaller amounts of the calcinating substance&#x27;. He described the disproportionation reaction:

:2 Sn(II) Sn(0) + Sn(IV).

===Analytical chemistry===

Having established the composition of Prussian blue, Gadolin suggested a method for precipitating ferrous iron as ferro ferricyanide, preceding the work of Gay-Lussac by forty years.

Reports of many of Gadolin&#x27;s chemical investigations appeared in German in Crell&#x27;s &quot;Chemische Annalen für die Freunde der Naturlehre, Arzneygelahrheit, Haushaltungskeit und Manufacturen&quot;. In 1825 he published &quot;Systema fossilium analysibus chemicis examinatorum secundum partium constitutivarum rationes ordinatorium&quot;, a system of mineral classification based upon chemical principles. The introduction outlines Gadolin&#x27;s theories, and the text presents mineral species in a systematic ordering.

One of Gadolin&#x27;s latest studies was the chemical analysis of the Chinese alloy &quot;pak tong&quot; in 1810 and 1827. Also known as alpacca or German silver, it was a less expensive silver substitute often containing copper, zinc, nickel, and tin.

Gadolin is also famous for publishing one of the earliest examples of counter-current condensers. In 1791 he improved a condenser design of his father&#x27;s by using the &quot;counter-current principle&quot;. By requiring water coolant to flow uphill, the effectiveness of the condenser was increased. This principle was later used by Justus Liebig, in what is today usually referred to as a Liebig condenser.

== Awards ==

Gadolin was knighted and is registered under number 245 in the Finnish House of Nobility. He was also awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir and the Order of Saint Anna. His heraldic device was:

Argent, on a bend Azure with two mullets Or between a rose Gules and crystals Proper.

==Later life==
Johan Gadolin married first, at age 35, Hedvig Tihleman, with whom he had nine children. After his wife&#x27;s death he married, at age 59, Ebba Palander. Gadolin retired as professor emeritus in 1822 at age 62, a mandatory age of retirement. He moved to a country estate where he lived for another 30 years. He died in Mynämäki, Finland on 15 August 1852.

The Great Fire of Turku of 1827 started in a bakery and damaged or destroyed much of the town of Åbo. Gadolin&#x27;s laboratory and collection of minerals near the cathedral were destroyed.

<doc id="1073115" wikidata="Q263829" url="?curid=1073115" title="Safiyya bint Huyayy">
<text>Safiyya bint Huyayy ( ) was a Jewish convert to Islam from the Banu Nadir tribe. After the Battle of Khaybar in 628, she was widowed and taken captive by the early Muslims and subsequently became Muhammad&#x27;s tenth wife. Like all other women who were married to Muhammad, Safiyya was known to Muslims as a &quot;Mother of the Believers&quot;. Their marriage produced no children and ended with Muhammad&#x27;s death in Medina in 632.

Before marrying the Prophet, Safiyyah had been married twice. Her first husband was the Rabbi Sallam ibn Mishkim, and her second was Kenana ibn al-Rabi, a key opponent of the Prophet. The latter was abusive toward Safiyyah; in the hadith, she recounted an incident where he struck her after she described a dream in which she saw the moon rising over Khaybar and falling into her lap. He interpreted it as her desiring the Prophet.

==Early life==
Safiyyah was born in Medina to Huyayy ibn Akhtab, the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir. Her mother, Barrah bint Samawal, was from the Banu Qurayza tribe. Her maternal grandfather was Samaw&#x27;al ibn &#x27;Adiya, a celebrated pre-Islamic Arabian Jewish poet from the Banu Harith tribe. According to a source, she was married off to Sallam ibn Mishkam, who later divorced her.

When the Banu Nadir were expelled from Medina in 625, her family settled in Khaybar, an oasis 153 kilometers from Medina. Her father and brother went from Khaybar to join the Meccan and Bedouin forces besieging Muhammad in Medina during the Battle of the Trench. When the Meccans withdrew, Muhammad besieged the Banu Qurayza. After the defeat of the Banu Qurayza in 627, Safiyya&#x27;s father, a long-time opponent of Muhammad, was captured and executed by the Muslims.

In 627 or early 628, Safiyya was married to Kenana ibn al-Rabi, treasurer of the Banu Nadir; she was about 17 years old at that time. Muslim sources claimed that Safiyya is said to have informed Kenana of a dream she had in which the moon had fallen from the heavens into her lap. Kenana interpreted it as a desire to marry Muhammad and struck her in the face, leaving a mark which was still visible when she first had contact with Muhammad.

==Battle of Khaybar==

In May 628, Muhammad and the Muslims invaded Khaybar, and several Jewish tribes (including the Banu Nadir) were defeated and surrendered. Some of the Jewish tribes were allowed to remain in the city on the condition that they give half of their annual produce to the Muslims. The land itself became property of the Muslim state. This settlement offer, according to Stillman, did not extend to the Banu Nadir tribe, who were given no mercy. As a result of the battle, Safiyya&#x27;s then-husband, Kenana ibn al-Rabi, was executed.

Dihya al-Kalbi, one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, requested a slave from the captives, and Muhammad granted him the choice. Dihya thus went and took Safiyya. Witnessing this, another companion informed Muhammad, highlighting Safiyya&#x27;s beauty and her status as the chief mistress of Banu Qurayza and the Nadir. The companion believed she was fit only for Muhammad, leading Muhammad to give the order to call them.

When Safiyya was delivered, she came along with another woman. The latter was distressed by the sight of the slain Jews, which prompted her to cry out and induce self-injury on her face. In response, Muhammad ordered her to be taken away. He directed that Safiyyah be placed behind him, with his cloak covering her, indicating to the Muslims that He had chosen her for himself, and told Dihya to take any other slave girl from the captives. It was reported that Dihya got seven slaves in exchange. Muhammad married Safiyya.

== Marriage to Muhammad ==
According to Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muhammad stayed for three days between Khaybar and Medina, where he consummated his marriage to Safiyya. His companions wondered if she was to be considered a slave or a wife. The former speculated that they would consider Safiyya as Muhammad&#x27;s wife, and thus a &quot;Mother of the Believers&quot;.

Muhammad advised Safiyya to convert to Islam, she accepted and agreed to became Muhammad&#x27;s wife. Safiyya did not bear any children to Muhammad. The marriage faced scrutiny from the companions. Some were suspicious of her intentions due to her background. On one occasion, a servant falsely accused Safiyyah of maintaining ties with her Jewish relatives inappropriately. She defended herself, explaining that she only upheld familial bonds, which is encouraged in Islam.

Regarding Safiyya&#x27;s Jewish descent, Muhammad once said to his wife that if other women insulted her for her Jewish heritage and were jealous because of her beauty, she was to respond: &quot;My father (ancestor) Harun (Aaron) was a prophet, my uncle (his brother) Musa (Moses) was a prophet, and my husband (Muhammad) is a prophet.&quot;

=== Consummation ===
Regarding the consummation of their marriage and her &#x27;idda (waiting period), several authentic hadith addressed this topic.

Her marriage was nullified after her husband was killed and she was taken as a slave, which is different from the typical case of a divorce or death of a woman&#x27;s husband. Because of this, consummation was based on istibra&#x27; (assurance of being free of pregnancy via menses) rather than &#x27;idda. Numerous authentic hadith reports describe this:



==Legacy==
After Muhammad&#x27;s death, she became involved in the power politics of the early Muslim community, and acquired substantial influence by the time of her death. In 656, Safiyya sided with caliph Uthman ibn Affan, and defended him at his last meeting with Ali, Aisha, and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. During the period when the caliph was besieged at his residence, Safiyya made an unsuccessful attempt to reach him, and supplied him with food and water via a plank placed between her dwelling and his.

Safiyya died in 670 or 672, during the reign of Mu&#x27;awiya I, and was buried in the Jannat al-Baqi graveyard. She left an estate of 100,000 dirhams in land and goods, one-third of which she bequeathed to her sister&#x27;s son, who followed Judaism. Her dwelling in Medina was bought by Muawiyya for 180,000 dirhams.

Her dream was interpreted as a miracle, and her suffering and reputation for crying won her a place in Sufi works. She is mentioned in all major books of hadith for relating a few traditions and a number of events in her life serve as legal precedents.
