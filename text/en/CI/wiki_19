<text>[[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] Standish O&#x27;Grady, 1st Viscount Guillamore, PC (1766 – 21 April 1840), from Cahir Guillamore, County Limerick, served as Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer for Ireland for a number of years. He was created Viscount Guillamore by a patent of 28 January 1831.

==Biography==
O&#x27;Grady was the eldest son of Darby O&#x27;Grady of Mount Prospect, Limerick, and of Mary, daughter of James Smyth of the same county. He was born on 20 January 1766, and, entering Trinity College, Dublin, graduated B.A. in 1784. He was called to the bar, and went on the Munster circuit. He was remarkable for wit as well as learning, and built up a considerable practice. He inherited the Cahir Guillamore estate on the death of his uncle John and was appointed High Sheriff of County Limerick for 1790.

On 10 June 1803, after the murder of Lord Kilwarden, O&#x27;Grady became Attorney-General and was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland. He was one of the prosecuting counsel at the trial of Robert Emmet. In October 1805 he was made Lord Chief Baron, in succession to Lord Avonmore. He was a sound judge, and David Richard Pigot, his successor as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, expressed the opinion: &quot;O&#x27;Grady was the ablest man whose mind I ever saw at work&quot;. His witticisms on and off the bench were long remembered. O&#x27;Grady was one of the first to suspect the duplicity of the notorious informer Leonard McNally. He clashed with his superiors in 1816 when they brought quo warranto proceedings to challenge his right to appoint his son Waller as a Court clerk.

On his retirement from the bench in 1831, O&#x27;Grady was created Viscount Guillamore of Cahir Guillamore and Baron O&#x27;Grady of Rockbarton, co. Limerick, in the peerage of Ireland. The O&#x27;Grady seat was Cahir Guillamore, close to Lough Gur. He was a handsome man, of a fine presence, and over in stature. He died in Dublin on 20 April 1840.

==Family==
In 1790 O&#x27;Grady married Katharine (died 1853), second daughter of John Thomas Waller of Castletown, co. Limerick, with whom he had at least twelve children:

*Sons
** Standish O&#x27;Grady, 2nd Viscount Guillamore (1792–1848) Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army, married Gertrude-Jane, daughter of Berkeley Paget: they had nine children, including the 3rd, 4th and 5th Viscounts.
** Waller, barrister-at-law, married on 26 June 1823, Grace-Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Hugh, 3rd Baron Massy. He became a Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) and Commissioner of the Irish Insolvency Court.
** John, joined the Royal Navy.
** Thomas, an officer in the British Army.
** William (1801-1859), a Church of England clergyman who became Archdeacon of Kilmacduagh.
* *Richard 1808-1875), Chief Examiner to the Court of Exchequer (Ireland).
*Daughters
** Maria, married on 13 December 1814, John Vereker, 3rd Viscount Gort.
** Katherine (d.1829), married Dudley Persse of Roxburgh, in County Galway, a cousin of the celebrated author Lady Gregory.
** Isabella, who never married.

<text>Chapter Music is one of Australia&#x27;s longest-running independent record labels. Chapter Music has worked with a broad range of mostly Australian artists, in genres such as rock and roll, indie pop, post punk, country and western and folk. Between 1992 and 2013, the label released around 45 titles, including several compilation albums, such as &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop It! Australian Post-Punk 1978-82&quot; and &quot;Songs For Nao&quot;. The label&#x27;s 2014 roster features bands such as Dick Diver, Beaches and Twerps.

==History==
The label was founded by Guy Blackman in Perth, Western Australia in June 1992, after he released several issues of a Syd Barrett-inspired fanzine called &quot;Chapter 24&quot;, started in October 1990, when Blackman was seventeen. Initially, Blackman released compilation cassettes of local Perth underground bands, the first of which was &quot;Bright Lights, Small City&quot; in July 1992. A Sonic Youth tribute tape called &quot;Kill Yr Idols!&quot; was the label&#x27;s next release, followed by a new fanzine called &quot;Salty &amp; Delicious&quot;. The label released a further eight cassettes (mostly compilations), one CD, and four issues of the fanzine prior to Blackman&#x27;s relocation to Melbourne, Australia. Blackman explained in 2012: &quot;When I sold out of the first Chapter Music cassette on the night of the show, that was a huge success for me, as a 17-year-old boy.&quot;

Blackman relocated to Melbourne in mid-1995, where he released Chapter Music&#x27;s first seven-inch vinyl single, pressed at Corduroy Records, a new pressing plant in Australia at the time. The single, a Molasses/Minimum Chips split single—Blackman is a member of the latter band—was released in September 1995. This was followed by a seven-inch single by Perth band Sulk, with a third release, a split single for Sleepy Township/Cannanes released in October 1996.

The label briefly closed for 18 months in 2002 when Blackman and his partner, Ben O&#x27;Connor, relocated to Japan. In a 2013 interview, Blackman explained that he made connections with a &quot;little underworld of Japanese underground psychpop&quot; during his time in Japan, in addition to playing his own live shows and collaborating with local artists. Blackman said that by the time his visa expired he felt like his time in Japan was merely starting; however, at the time of the interview, he explained that he retained connections with artists like Tenniscoats following his return to Australia.

Chapter Music reissued the 1980 self-titled live recording of Melbourne post-punk/noise band Primitive Calculators in 2004, which was the band&#x27;s sole official release at the time. The label released the 17-track &quot;Primitive Calculators and Friends&quot; compilation in 2007, which featured the only Primitive Calculators studio recording ever released and the &quot;Little Bands&quot; compilation. In a 2009 interview, Stuart, of Primitive Calculators, said: &quot;I think Guy Blackman is a kind of angel to do what he does and stay who he is.&quot;

The label&#x27;s 20th anniversary occurred in 2012 and the label was co-managed by Blackman and O&#x27;Connor by this stage. In an interview with the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; (&quot;SMH&quot;) in November 2012, O&#x27;Connor explained: &quot;We&#x27;ve only ever done things that we love and care about&quot;, while Blackman expressed his view on the label&#x27;s longevity openly:
I&#x27;ve found myself becoming very sensitive to any perceived indifference to the anniversary ... To me it seems like a big deal. There&#x27;s not that many record labels that last this long; Ben and I have watched a lot of them come and go.

Chapter Music released a compilation of rarities, &quot;20 Big Ones&quot;, as part of the 20th anniversary commemoration—including a song by Minimum Chips—and an anniversary show was staged in Melbourne, during Melbourne Music Week, with performances from Crayon Fields, Twerps, Pikelet, Laura Jean and Primitive Calculators, among others.

In the 2012 &quot;SMH&quot; interview, Blackman described the label&#x27;s health as &quot;better than ever&quot;, and explained in an interview the following year that the label &quot;can provide support for a long term career for a band ... The community aspect and the relationships are the most important thing about the label.&quot; During 2013, Chapter Music attended the CMJ Music Marathon and released albums by Dick Diver, Beaches, Primitive Calculators, Pikelet and Bushwalking. The Primitive Calculators release, &quot;The World Is Fucked&quot;, is the first-ever studio album by the band, which was 35 years old at the time of the release date.

An August 2014 announcement revealed that Twerps signed to US label Merge Records, while retaining their arrangement with Chapter Music for Australia and New Zealand. The &quot;Underlay&quot; EP—described by music journalist Anthony Carew as &quot;the work of a band who’s already done a lap around the hype-bubble block and returned feeling jaded&quot;—was released by the band in August 2014. Also in August 2014, Laura Jean released her self-titled album on Chapter Music, which was recorded in England, UK, with John Parish.

In 2023, Chapter Music released The Native Cats&#x27; catalogue on streaming services.

==Accolades==
Beaches&#x27; 2008 debut album was shortlisted for the Australian Music Prize, and listed in the 2010 book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. In December 2013, Chapter Music artists Dick Diver, Primitive Calculators, Bushwalking and Beaches featured in the critics&#x27; lists of the &quot;mess+noise&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; websites, as they selected their best Australian albums of 2013. Dick Diver&#x27;s &quot;Calendar Days&quot; was voted into the number 1 position by the &quot;Guardian&quot; critics; the album was then voted into the number 1 position of the &quot;mess + noise&quot; 2013 readers poll. In BuzzFeed&#x27;s &quot;The Very Best Australian Albums of 2013&quot; list, published on 29 December 2013, both Beaches and Dick Diver appeared.

In 2019, Chapter Music won the AIR Award for Best Independent Label.

<doc id="1049480" wikidata="Q16242" url="?curid=1049480" title="Province of Pescara">
<text>The province of Pescara (; Abruzzese: &quot;&quot;) is a province in the Abruzzo region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Pescara, which has a population of 119,483 inhabitants. As of 2017, it has a total population of 319,936 inhabitants over an area of . The provincial president is Antonio Zaffiri and the province contains 46 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;).

==History==
Pescara&#x27;s first indicators of settlement date to 1500 BCE, but it is unknown which tribe first settled in the city. It was conquered by the Romans in 214 BCE and remained &quot;Aternum&quot; after the city allied itself with Punic Carthaginian military commander Hannibal. The Romans developed the city and it became an important location for shipping and trade occurring between the Balkans and Rome; the Romans made the city of Pescara the capital of the Valeria region. During the barbarian raids it was almost completely destroyed, and it developed into a fishing village named Piscaria.

Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor turned Piscaria into a military fort named Pescara during the sixteenth century, and Pescara survived a series of invasions from Turkish Muslims. It was ruled by the Austrians for a short period of the 1700s before falling under the control of the House of Bourbon; the House of Bourbon made it a component of Abruzzo Citra. It joined the Kingdom of Italy in 1860 and was still mainly fortified and Pescara was made a new provincial capital in 1927. In World War II, 78% of the city was destroyed by bombers.

==Geography==
The province of Pescara is the central of four provinces in the region of Abruzzo on the eastern coast of Italy. It is bounded to the northeast by the Adriatic Sea. The Province of Teramo lies to the north and the Province of L&#x27;Aquila to the west and south. To the south and east lies the Province of Chieti. The provincial capital is the city and port of Pescara, situated at the mouth of the Aterno-Pescara River.

=== Pescara ===

The city is divided in two by the river.

The historic city center is located on the south shore, where once stood the Piazzaforte (fortified town), a military bulwark of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. There is the Bagno Borbonico (the old prison of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, built starting in 1510 by order of Charles V, which incorporated inside the remains of the Norman and Byzantine city walls). Today it houses the Museum of the Abruzzi people: the institution traces, towards 13 halls dedicated to the aspects of life, traditions and economy, 4,000 years of history of the Abruzzo people.

In the historic city center are the birthplace houses of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Ennio Flaiano, and the San Cetteo Cathedral, build between 1933 and 1938.

On the north shore of the river there&#x27;s Piazza Italia (Italy Square), overlooked by the City Hall and the Government Building (which houses the headquarters of the province of Pescara), both built during the Fascist era according to the fascist rationalist style and designed by the architect Vincenzo Pilotti. Pilotti designed the majority of the public buildings of the city, including the seat of the local Chamber of Commerce, of the Liceo Classico &quot;G. D&#x27;Annunzio&quot; high school, and the old seat of the court (which now houses a museum).

In the very south part of the city, between the D&#x27;Avalos Park and the beach, there is an elegant Art Nouveau villas district designed in 1912 by Antonino Liberi (an engineer brother-in-law of D&#x27;Annunzio). There is also the Aurum, first headquarters of a social club (called the Kursaal), then liquor factory, and today public multipurpose space.

In 2007 was built the Ponte del Mare, the largest pedestrian and cycle bridge in Italy.

On the northern waterfront, close to the &quot;Salotto Square&quot;, the main square of the city, there is the &quot;Nave&quot; (trad. the ship), a sculpture by Pietro Cascella.

<doc id="1049482" wikidata="Q4044724" url="?curid=1049482" title="Mycobacterium xenopi">
<text>Mycobacterium xenopi is a slow-growing scotochromogenic species of &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;. It was first reported by Schwabacher in 1959, having been isolated in lesions found on a &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;, but the possibility of human infection was not confirmed until 1965. It has been cultured from hot and cold water taps, hospital hot water generators and storage tanks, and other environmental sources. 

It has low pathogenicity in humans, and where infections have been found they are closely associated with immunocompromised individuals, such as an extrapulmonary malignancy, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, or immunosuppressive therapy. Pulmonary disease may be chronic, subacute, or acute; symptoms are indistinguishable from those associated with disease caused by &quot;M. kansasii&quot;.

Radiographic findings with &quot;M. xenopi&quot; pulmonary disease are variable but most often include upper lobe cavitary abnormalities similar to tuberculosis.

Treatment is usually with macrolide, rifampin, and ethambutol with moxifloxacin.

Type strain: strain ATCC 19250 = CCUG 28011 = CCUG 31306 = CIP 104035 = DSM 43995 = NCTC 10042.

<text>Theodore Edwin White (born February 4, 1938) is an American science fiction writer, editor and fan, as well as a music critic. He writes and edits as Ted White. In addition to books and stories written under his own name, he has also co-authored novels with Dave van Arnam as Ron Archer, and with Terry Carr as Norman Edwards. He won a Hugo Award in 1968.

==Author, editor, critic and DJ==

===Fandom origins===
Since the time he was a teenager, White has been a prolific contributor to science fiction fanzines, and in 1968 he won the Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer. His skill as an essayist is evident in &quot;The Bet&quot;, a memoir of a tense day in 1960 when a dispute over a record owned by music critic Linda Solomon prompted fellow science fiction writer Harlan Ellison to bet his entire record collection against a single record in White&#x27;s collection, and then renege on the deal.

Despite his considerable professional credits, White maintains that his achievements in fandom mean more to him than anything else he has done. In 1953, he edited and published &quot;Zip&quot;, the first of many fanzines he published over the following decades. In 1956–57, he co-edited &quot;Stellar&quot; with Larry Stark, followed by &quot;Void&quot; when he joined the founding editors, Gregory Benford and James Benford (1960), &quot;Minac&quot;, &quot;Egoboo&quot; and others. In addition to helping others publish their own fanzines, he was a regular columnist in &quot;Yandro&quot; and Richard E. Geis&#x27; &quot;Psychotic/SF Review&quot;. He also has been active in numerous fan events, such as organizing the 1967 World Science Fiction Convention in New York as co-chairman. As of 2018, he was still active on several of the fandom- and fanzine-oriented electronic mailing lists.

===Radio===
From 1977 into 1979, as Dr. Progresso, he did the Friday afternoon &quot;Dr. Progresso&quot; radio show on WGTB-FM (90.1).

===Music critic===
In 1959, at the age of 21, White moved from Falls Church, Virginia, to New York City with his first wife, Sylvia Dees White. That year, he began writing music criticism for &quot;Metronome&quot; and a column for Tom Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Guide&quot; (later &quot;33 Guide&quot;). As a music critic, he expanded into jazz writing and journalism for &quot;Rogue&quot;, along with LP liner notes, concert reviews and interviews. He was the only person to record an interview with Eric Dolphy (who died in 1964). Moving online, White became the music editor of the Collecting Channel website in 1999, and he maintains his own website of music commentary under his Dr. Progresso pseudonym.

===Science fiction author===
&quot;Phoenix&quot;, a 1963 collaboration with Marion Zimmer Bradley, was White&#x27;s first professionally published story, which he later expanded into the novel &quot;Phoenix Prime&quot;, beginning the &quot;Qanar&quot; series of books. His first novel, &quot;Invasion from 2500&quot; (1964), was written in collaboration with Terry Carr under the pseudonym Norman Edwards. Between 1964 and 1978 he wrote two science fiction series and 11 standalone novels, including one Captain America novel. Two of the novels were written in collaboration with Dave van Arnam, one with David Bischoff and one, using White&#x27;s &quot;Doc Phoenix&quot; character, with Marv Wolfman.

White was a 1966 Nebula nominee for his short story, &quot;The Peacock King,&quot; written with Larry McCombs. He was also instrumental in kick-starting the professional careers of other writers, notably Lee Hoffman.

===Editor===
White held the position of assistant editor at &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; from 1963 to 1968. From October 1968 until October 1978, he edited &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;, upgrading the quality of the fiction while showcasing a variety of talented illustrators. He also edited two 1973 anthologies, &quot;The Best from Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;The Best from Fantastic&quot;.

His reputation as an editor impressed the publishers of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine, who hired him to introduce non-fiction and prose fiction into the magazine, which featured mainly graphic stories until White&#x27;s arrival in 1979. White lasted at the helm of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; until August 1980.

In 1985, he was an associate editor of the magazine &quot;Stardate&quot;.

===Musician===
White also plays keyboards and saxophone. He performed with the Washington, D.C., area improvisational group Conduit.

<text>Timothy Guy Phelps (December 20, 1824 – June 11, 1899) was an American politician, businessman, and government official. He was the first president of the Southern Pacific Railroad from 1865 until 1868 and saw the railroad build its first tracks south of San Francisco, California.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Phelps was born in Oxford, New York, and completed preparatory schooling there and then moved to New York City in 1845 where he worked in mercantile for a short time, then returned to Chenango County to study law.

=== Mining ===
As soon as word of the mid-century gold finds in California reached New York, Phelps took a boat to the west coast. He arrived in San Francisco, California, via Panama, on December 14, 1849 and he moved to Tuolumne County, California, where he tried his hand at mining. Failing to find a fortune in gold, he moved to San Francisco to resume a career in the mercantile, starting a merchant house in August 1850.

===Career===
Phelps&#x27;s business losses were substantial in the great fire of May 1851, but Phelps rebuilt and soon recovered his loss. It was during this period of recovery that he purchased of land in what is now San Mateo County, California. He used the land for farming and soon decided to make the area, now the city of San Carlos, his home.

Living in San Carlos, in 1851 Phelps became involved in the local vigilance committee in an effort to uphold the law.

=== State assembly ===
Following a failed state assembly bid in 1854, when he ran with Col. E.D. Baker, Phelps was elected to the California State Assembly in 1855 and served until 1857 as the first Republican from San Francisco and San Mateo Counties. During his term, he served on the first Grand Jury on August 1, 1856. He introduced &quot;An Act to reorganize and establish the County of San Mateo&quot; in March 1857.

He then was served in the California State Senate from 1858 to 1861. During the 1859 Republican California state convention, his name was advanced as a potential nominee for governor, but he withdrew in favor of Leland Stanford.

In a subsequent 1861 Republican state convention, he ran for the Republican nomination for governor, but was defeated by Stanford, 197 votes to 104.

=== Congress ===
Following the 1861 convention, he was elected to the 37th United States Congress where he served from March 4, 1861, until March 3, 1863. When the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad was built in the 1860s, the right of way from Redwood City to Belmont was granted from Phelps&#x27;s land.

=== Later career ===
His next job was in real estate until 1870 when he became the customs collector for the port of San Francisco (until 1872). In 1875, he won the Republican nomination for Governor of California, but he was defeated by the Democratic candidate William Irwin, in part aided by disgruntled Republicans who ran John Bidwell as an independent candidate. In 1888, Phelps ran for Congress again, but was defeated by the Democrat Thomas J. Clunie.

He also served as a regent of the University of California at Berkeley from 1878 until his death.

===Personal life===
He married Sophronia J. Jewell (born Nov 13, 1824), of Guilford, New York, on September 13, 1853. Sophronia died on and Phelps was remarried to Josephine A. McLean in 1870.

=== Death ===
He died at age 74 on June 11, 1899, near San Carlos, California, after he was struck by two boys on a tandem bicycle. The cyclists turned themselves in after learning of his death, and charges against them were dropped on June 20, 1899, after they related their account of the crash.

<text>The province of Teramo (; Abruzzese: &quot;&quot;) is a province in the Abruzzo region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Teramo. The province has an area of , a population of 313,029 (2012), and is subdivided into 47 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;), see comunes of the province of Teramo. The province of Teramo shares its northern border with the province of Ascoli Piceno in the Marche region, southern and southwestern borders with the province of L&#x27;Aquila in the Abruzzo region, and a western border with the province of Rieti in the Lazio region. To the south is the province of Pescara in the Abruzzo region and to the east is the Adriatic Sea.

The landscape of the Province of Teramo is dominated almost entirely on the east by a large body of water with the beaches of the Adriatic Sea and by the Apennine Mountains which his highest peak of Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia westside. The province is indeed divided latitudinally by the characteristic hills and valleys rich in vineyards and olive groves that begin in the Apennines and run almost to the coast. Colline Teramane (Teramo Hills) has become a trademark and are one of the most significant areas where olive oil and Abruzzo wines are produced. Unique of the province of Teramo is the short distance between the beaches of the Adriatic Sea and the snowcapped Gran Sasso peaks. They can be reached within an hour from one point to the other.
The peaks of the Gran Sasso rise to the west of the Province of Teramo while those of the Monti della Laga dominate its northern border. These two ridges are among the most distinctive and the most relevant of the entire Apennine Mountain range. The majestic Gran Sasso rises at its peak, the Corno Grande, to an elevation of and is characterized by steep, and in places virtually inaccessible, gorges with nature reserves and protected living species. A good part of Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park is nestled in the province. Calderone, the southernmost glacier in Continental European, is found nearby. In contrast to the rugged and isolated Gran Sasso area, the Monti della Laga are characterised by thick forests, shallow gorges, rolling slopes and valleys, and several spectacular waterfalls.
In addition to the provincial capital, the most populous and important commercial centers include Roseto degli Abruzzi and Giulianova with populations of 25,000 and 24,000 inhabitants respectively.

<text>Getrag (), stylized as GETRAG, was a major supplier of transmission systems for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The company was founded on 1 May 1935, in Ludwigsburg, Germany, by Hermann Hagenmeyer; as the &quot;Getriebe und Zahnradfabrik Hermann Hagenmeyer GmbH &amp; Cie KG&quot;.

Headquartered in Untergruppenbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, Getrag manufactured and developed passenger car transmission products and solutions for the important automotive markets Europe, Asia, and North America with 24 locations and about 12,500 employees worldwide. In 2011, the company had a turnover of three billion euros.

The company had three joint ventures: Getrag Ford Transmissions headquartered in Cologne with Ford Motor Company, Getrag (Jiangxi) Transmission Co. Ltd. with Jiangling Motors Corporation., Ltd. and Dongfeng Getrag Transmission with Dongfeng Motor Corporation. In addition, Getrag supplied transmissions to a variety of automotive manufacturers, including BMW (Mini), Daimler AG, Ferrari, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Qoros, Renault, Volkswagen Group and Volvo. Competitors include Aisin, BorgWarner, Graziano and ZF.

The portfolio ranged from classic manual transmissions, automated manual transmissions, and automatic transmissions based on dual-clutch transmission (DCT) technology to various hybridization solutions, range extender systems, and purely electric drivetrains.

In July 2015, Getrag was acquired by Magna Powertrain for $1.9 billion and was gradually integrated into the company.

<text>Cidona is an Irish apple-based soft drink that has been on sale since 1955. It is popular in Ireland and has some sales in the United Kingdom.

It was once produced by cider producers Bulmers (part of C&amp;C) and comes in a distinctive green bottle. It is now part of Britvic Ireland due to C&amp;C selling their soft drink segment in 2007.

==UK version==
In 1940, it was being advertised in the UK Radio Times by H. P. Bulmer as &#x27;The newest, non-alcoholic, sparkling apple drink&#x27; and priced at 10 pence for a &#x27;big 5 glass flagon&#x27;.

<text>Strathfield is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located 12 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre of the Municipality of Strathfield. A small section of the suburb north of the railway line lies within the City of Canada Bay, while the area east of The Boulevard lies within the Municipality of Burwood. North Strathfield and Strathfield South are separate suburbs to the north and south, respectively.

==History==
The Strathfield district lies between the Concord Plains to the north and the Cooks River to the south, and was originally occupied by the Wangal clan. European colonisation in present-day Strathfield commenced in 1793 with the issue of land grants in the area of &quot;Liberty Plains&quot;, an area including present-day Strathfield as well as surrounding areas, where the first free settlers received land grants. In 1808, a grant was made to James Wilshire, which forms the largest part of the current suburb of Strathfield. This grant was bounded by present-day The Boulevarde, Chalmers Street and Liverpool Road. Wiltshire&#x27;s grant by Governor Macquarie in 1808 [regranted 1810] followed representations from Lord Nelson, a relation by marriage of Wilshire.

In the west, Wiltshire&#x27;s grant neighboured an area that was granted in 1823 to the Church of England, to support clergy in the colony, which covered the western part of present-day Strathfield and Flemington (Homebush West). The church lands were sold in 1841

Ownership of Wiltshire&#x27;s grant was transferred in 1824 to ex-convict Samuel Terry. The land became known as the Redmire Estate, which Michael Jones says could either be named after his home town Redmire in North Yorkshire, England, or could be named after the &quot;red clay of the Strathfield area&quot;.

The railway came to Strathfield in 1855, with Homebush station built as one of the initial four stations on the railway line between Sydney and Parramatta. A station was sited here because of the presence of Homebush Racecourse north of Parramatta Road. The arrival of the railway spurred residential development. Subdivision of the &quot;Redmire Estate&quot; began in 1867, which led to residential development forming the village of &quot;Redmire&quot; or &quot;Redmyre&quot;. An early buyer was one-time Mayor of Sydney, Walter Renny who built in 1868 a house they called &quot;Stratfieldsaye&quot;, possibly after the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s mansion near Reading, Berkshire. It may have also been named after the transport ship of the same name that transported many immigrants – including Sir Henry Parkes – to Australia, though the transport ship was probably also named after the Duke&#x27;s mansion as it was built soon after his death and was likely named in his honour. A plaque marking the location of &quot;Stratfield Saye&quot; can be found in the footpath of Strathfield Avenue, marking the approximate location of the original house [though some of the wording on the plaque is incorrect]. According to local historian Cathy Jones, &quot;ownership of [&quot;Stratfieldsaye&quot;] was transferred several times including to Davidson Nichol, who shortened the name to &#x27;Strathfield House&#x27;, then &#x27;Strathfield&#x27;.&quot; In 1877, development had progressed sufficiently to justify the addition of a halt on the railway line at Redmyre, east of existing Homebush station. The Village of Homebush Estate, part of which forms the northern part of today&#x27;s Strathfield, was subdivided in 1878.
By 1885, sufficient numbers of people resided in the district to enable incorporation of its own local government. &quot;Strathfield&quot; as a geographical name was first established when Strathfield Council was proclaimed on 2 June 1885 by the Governor of NSW, Sir Augustus Loftus, after residents of the Redmire area petitioned the New South Wales State government for the establishment of local government. The new local government area included parts of the three established residential areas of Redmire (now central Strathfield), Homebush (now Homebush South and northern Strathfield) and Druitt Town (now southern Strathfield). Residents in Homebush and Druitt Town formed their own unsuccessful counter-petition. It is likely that the region was named Strathfield to neutralise the rivalry between Homebush and Redmire. The railway station was also renamed &quot;Strathfield&quot; in 1885, and it became an important interchange station when the Great Northern Railway was opened the following year, between Strathfield and Hornsby.

===Strathfield Council===


Strathfield Council was incorporated in 1885 and included parts of the then-established suburbs of Redmire, Homebush and Druitt Town. The part of Redmire incorporated into Strathfield Council included the central part of today&#x27;s suburb of Strathfield, the part of Homebush incorporated into Strathfield included the southern part of today&#x27;s suburb of Homebush as well as the northern part of today&#x27;s Strathfield (Village of Homebush or Homebush South), and the part of Druitt Town incorporated into Strathfield included the southern part of today&#x27;s Strathfield. In directories, addresses in all three areas were included under &quot;Strathfield&quot; after the council was established.

The adjoining areas of Flemington, North Homebush and southern Druitt Town was unincorporated. The southern part of Flemington was annexed to Strathfield Council in 1892 (now the southern part of Homebush West and the western part of Strathfield), which increased the size of the Council area by about 50%. The Council formed three wards – Flemington, Homebush and Strathfield – and Aldermen was elected to represent their ward at Council. Wards were abolished in 1916. Today&#x27;s suburb of Strathfield encompasses the entire Council area as enlarged in 1892, except for a small area immediately to the south of Homebush and Flemington stations: the village centres immediately south of Homebush and Flemington stations were carved out of Strathfield and joined with the area formerly in Homebush Council in the late 20th century, creating the modern suburbs of Homebush and Flemington (Homebush West).

Meanwhile, the southern part of Druitt Town which was not incorporated into Strathfield became part of Enfield Council, then was amalgamated into Strathfield Council in 1949 and renamed &quot;Strathfield South&quot;.

The eastern part of former Redmire - renamed Strathfield - became part of Burwood Council. The boundary between Strathfield and Burwood was a straight line running north–south aligned with the Boulevarde, and as a result there was a small portion to the north of Strathfield Council boundaries and west of Burwood Council boundaries that was not part of either council. This portion became part of Concord Council (later combined into the City of Canada Bay). This has resulted in the modern suburb of Strathfield being split between the three councils.

The suburb of Strathfield became a popular residential suburb in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The building of Strathfield station, and its expansion into a major suburban, intercity and interstate station, with direct services to Sydney Central, Melbourne and Canberra, helped to make the suburb one of the most accessible in Sydney by rail. It was also close to major road and water transport routes. Members of Sydney&#x27;s business elite, such as the family of William Arnott and David Jones, built various large homes in Strathfield. After federation, Strathfield continued to be favoured by business and political leaders, with prime ministers Earle Page, George Reid and Frank Forde all having lived in the suburb, and Billy Hughes lived in the part of &quot;Strathfield&quot; which is now Homebush South. Page, for example, chose to live in Strathfield because of its direct rail services to Melbourne, then the seat of federal parliament, and his electorate on the north coast of New South Wales. Some of the large homes built in this period were purchased by private schools, and the unusually large number of private and public schools in the one suburb further increased residential demand.

Following the introduction of the Local Government Act in 1919, Strathfield Council was one of the first to proclaim the major part of its area a residential district by proclamation in 1920. Strathfield underwent suburban subdivision in the early 20th century, with more suburban houses on smaller lots being built rather than the substantial mansions with expansive grounds built in the earlier period. Nevertheless, it remained a popular residential area. In 1977, Strathfield was the most expensive suburb in metropolitan Sydney measured by median house price.

More significant commercial development took place in the last quarter of the 20th century, with a &quot;modern&quot; shopping centre, Strathfield Plaza, opening in 1981, accompanied by the first high rise residential apartment building in the suburb. More towers followed in the next few decades, concentrated around the station.

The catchment of Strathfield Girls stretches north to Concord West, west to Homebush West and east to the western part of Burwood, but does not include the southern-most section of the suburb of Strathfield itself. Strathfield South High School is co-educational, and its catchment includes the southern-most section of Strathfield, as well as the suburbs further south including parts of Chullora and Greenacre, Belfield, Strathfield South, Enfield and Croydon Park.

==Built environment==



Strathfield has a long history as a &quot;desirable suburb for Sydney&#x27;s better classes&quot;, especially prior to the building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge allowed residential development to flourish on the North Shore. Although the Inner West region became eclipsed by the Eastern Suburbs and the North Shore as premium residential areas, Strathfield with its boulevardes, large houses and established schools remained a popular suburb for residents. Even in 1977, Strathfield was the most expensive suburb in metropolitan Sydney by median house price. In December 2021, Strathfield (post code area 2135) was the 13th most expensive area by postcode in Australia, when measured by median house price. Of the top 20 most expensive post code areas (all of which are in metropolitan Sydney), Strathfield was the only one which was located outside the Eastern Suburbs, North Shore or Northern Beaches regions.

Strathfield&#x27;s residential landscape is extremely varied, ranging from country-style estates to high-rise apartments. Many styles of architecture have been employed over past decades, with dwellings having been constructed in Victorian, Federation, Interwar period architecture, Californian Bungalow and contemporary periods. One of the oldest surviving houses built in the 1870s is Fairholm which is now a retirement village called Strathfield Gardens. Primarily these have been replaced by modern, multimillion-dollar mansions, although Strathfield has retained its wide avenues and most of the extensive natural vegetation. Streets such as Victoria Street, Llandillo Avenue and Kingsland Road predominantly feature older mansions, while Agnes Street, Newton Road and Barker Road are common locations for new homes. In the vicinity of Homebush Road, a number of noted tree-lined avenues follow an oblique street pattern established by the development of the Village of Homebush in the late 19th century, and are noted for the grand, historic houses built in the late 19th and early 20th centursies. These include Albert Road, historically known as one of Sydney&#x27;s most prestigious streets and was lined by landmark mansions. Some of these have been replaced by institutions and others have been subdivided, but the street retains some of the most prestigious houses in the area;. and Redmyre Road, a wide boulevard which retains most of its Victorian mansions and large Federation-era houses. Further to the southeast, a pocket of the suburb bounded by Hunter Street, Carrington Avenue, Homebush Road and the Boulevarde is known in the real estate press as the &quot;Golden Mile&quot;, because it contains some of the most desirable and highly sought-after real estate in the area. Examples of prestigious addresses in this area include homes located on Cotswold Road, Strathfield Avenue, Llandilo Avenue, Agnes and Highgate Street. Additionally, decreasing land sizes through subdivision has led to an increase in residential densities, reflecting the outward expansion of Sydney&#x27;s inner city. A large proportion of Strathfield&#x27;s population now dwells in apartments with the area immediately surrounding Strathfield railway station dominated by high rise residential towers. Smaller apartment buildings are located in other areas within the suburbs, were mostly built during the 1960s and 1970s.

In the last century a number of grand Strathfield homes became independent school campuses:
* Holyrood – Santa Sabina
* Brunyarra – Santa Maria Del Monte
* &quot;Lauriston&quot; – Santa Maria Del Monte
* Llandilo – Trinity Grammar School
* Somerset – Trinity Grammar School
* Milverton – Trinity Grammar School
* Riccarton/The Briars – Meriden and partially demolished
* Wariora – Meriden and now demolished
* Lingwood/Branxton – PLC Sydney and now Meriden School
* Selbourne – Meriden and now demolished
* Telerah – Wadham Preparatory School

==Commercial areas==

Strathfield&#x27;s commercial town centre is centred on a town square south of the station, and includes the Strathfield Plaza shopping centre which includes Woolworths and other stores, as well as a large number of cafes, restaurants and other stores located around the square and along Albert Road, Churchill Avenue, Redmyre Road and the Boulevarde. Strathfield&#x27;s town centre is particularly known for a large concentration of Korean restaurants and shops catering to Korean cultural needs. The area is often called Little Korea.

Other commercial areas in the suburb include a small commercial area immediately north of the station, a commercial area along the southern boundary concentrated around the intersection of the Boulevarde and Liverpool Road (part of a town centre around the former Enfield Town Hall). The northern parts of Strathfield are served by the Homebush and Flemington village centres, which were carved out of the suburb of Strathfield after 1947.

There are also some car dealerships and other commercial premises along Parramatta Road and Liverpool Road, on the northern and southern boundaries of the suburb.

==Transport==

Strathfield railway station is a major interchange on the Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink networks, and has long been an interchange for several of Sydney&#x27;s suburban lines, as well as intercity services and interstate services. However, intercity services from Strathfield significantly reduced in 2013. With the upgrading of the East Hills line, intercity trains heading southwest to Canberra and Melbourne from Sydney Central began to use that line, leaving only intercity trains to the north and west to continue using Strathfield station. The bus station located on the town square, immediately south of the station, is an interchange for buses serving the Inner West.

In the west, Strathfield is bounded by the A3 arterial road, linking Strathfield with the St George region, where it joins the A1 road (Princes Highway) towards Sutherland Shire and the south coast, while in the north it connects Strathfield with Ryde and Pymble and Gordon, where it intersects with the A1 road again and then proceeds towards the Northern Beaches.

Strathfield is bounded in the north by the Great Western Highway (Parramatta Road) and in the south by the Hume Highway (Liverpool Road), both major arterial roads. The Great Western Highway links Strathfield east to Ashfield, where it splits with Parramatta Road proceeding to east towards Broadway and the southern City and the A4 road proceeding northeast to the Sydney CBD and Sydney Harbour Bridge. To the west, it leads to Parramatta, Blacktown, Penrith and beyond. The Hume Highway links Strathfield east to Ashfield, where it joins Parramatta Road, and west to Bankstown, Liverpool, Canberra and Melbourne. The M4 Western Motorway largely parallels the Great Western Highway but lies outside Strathfield suburb boundaries. The exit at Concord Road in North Strathfield serves Strathfield.

Two local arterial routes serving the Inner West, formed by Concord Road-Raw Square-The Boulevarde (north-south, formerly part of Metroad 3 and State Route 27) and Beresford Road-Albert Road-Redmyre Road-Morwick Street (west-east), join and intersect in central Strathfield in a complex pattern.

==Demographics==

According to the , Strathfield had a total population of 25,915 people, a slight increase compared to 25,813 in 2016. 

The availability of a fast and convenient rail connection to many parts of Sydney and the development of high density residential blocks near the station have made Strathfield&#x27;s town centre an attractive place to live for successive waves of temporary and permanent migrants in recent decades. While the concentration of restaurants and shops catering to Korean cultural needs in the vicinity of Strathfield station has created a perception of Strathfield as a Korean suburb (see &quot;Commercial area&quot; section), the proportion of residents who are Korean by birth or ancestry has never been a particularly large: many more members of the Korean community in Sydney travel into the suburb to visit the commercial area. According to the 2021 census, only 7.7% of residents identified as Korean by ancestry, and the Chinese and Anglo-Celtic ancestry groups are much larger. In recent years, there has also been a sharp rise in Nepalese arrivals.

In 2021, 34.6% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were Nepal 13.6%, China 8.6%, India 6.8%, South Korea 6.2%, and Vietnam 3.1%. The most common ancestries were Chinese 21.7%, Nepalese 13.0%, English 8.2%, Australian 7.7% and Korean 7.7%. 76.7% of people had both parents born overseas.

29.4% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Nepali 12.9%, Mandarin 9.3%, Cantonese 7.2%, Korean 7.1% and Arabic 4.8%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 23.1%, Catholic 21.8%, Hinduism 20.8% and Buddhism 7.2%.

==Culture==
Strathfield has made an impact on the indie rock and indie pop scene, producing bands such as Prince Vlad &amp; the Gargoyle Impalers, Lunatic Fringe, The Mexican Spitfires and Women of Troy. It has also inspired pop songs such as The Mexican Spitfires&#x27;s song &quot;Rookwood&quot; about Rookwood Cemetery and the legendary Blitzkrieg punk rock of Radio Birdman&#x27;s classic mid-1970s &quot;Murder City Nights&quot;. Indie pop legend Grant McLennan of The Go-Betweens also called Carrington Avenue, Strathfield home for a few years in the 1990s.

==Strathfield Murders==
On 17 August 1991, seven people were killed, when Wade Frankum stabbed a fifteen-year-old girl to death, before running amok with a rifle in the Strathfield Plaza shopping mall, and then turning the weapon on himself. This is commonly known as the Strathfield Massacre. A Memorial plaque is located at Churchill Avenue, Strathfield.

<text>Wolfgang Gröbner (11 February 1899 – 20 August 1980) was an Austrian mathematician. His name is best known for the Gröbner basis, used for computations in algebraic geometry. However, the theory of Gröbner bases for polynomial rings was developed by his student Bruno Buchberger in 1965, who named them for Gröbner. Gröbner is also known for the Alekseev-Gröbner formula, which was actually proven by him.

==Early life==
Gröbner was born in Gossensaß, which at that time was in part of the County of Tyrol of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now part of Italy.
Gröbner first studied engineering at the University of Technology in Graz, Austria, but switched in 1929 to mathematics.

==Career==
He wrote his dissertation &quot;Ein Beitrag zum Problem der Minimalbasen&quot; in 1932 at the University of Vienna; his advisor was Philipp Furtwängler. After his promotion, he did further studies at the University of Göttingen under Emmy Noether, in what is now known as commutative algebra. Later he contributed with his students to numerical analysis of ordinary differential equations and the industrial applications of Lie-theoretic methods, including a book on Lie series.

==Awards==
*Wilhelm Exner Medal, 1969.

<text>Mario Alberto Ettore Monicelli (; 16 May 1915 – 29 November 2010) was an Italian film director and screenwriter, one of the masters of the &quot;commedia all&#x27;italiana&quot; (&quot;Italian-style comedy&quot;). He was nominated six times for an Oscar, and received the Golden Lion for his career.

==Biography==

=== The early times ===
Monicelli was born in Rome to an upper-class family from Ostiglia, a town in the province of Mantua, in the Northern Italian region of Lombardy. He was the second of the five children of Tomaso Monicelli, a journalist, and Maria Carreri, a housewife. His older half-brother, Giorgio (whose mother was actress Elisa Severi), worked as a writer and translator. An older brother, Franco, was a journalist.

Monicelli was raised in Rome, Viareggio (Tuscany) and Milan. He lived a mostly carefree youth. Many of the cinematic jokes he later shot in &quot;My Friends&quot; (1975) were inspired by his own experiences during his years in Tuscany.

During his time at the university in Milan, Monicelli met Riccardo Freda, Remo Cantoni, Alberto Lattuada, Alberto Mondadori and Vittorio Sereni, with whom he founded the newspaper &quot;Camminare&quot;, also thanks to the support of the publisher Mondadori. In &quot;Camminare&quot;, Monicelli wrote the columns on film criticism. He tended to write critically about Italian films while praising American and French films. Monicelli later recounted that his non-nationalistic taste might have been a veiled form of anti-fascism. Indeed, the experience with &quot;Camminare&quot; did not last long in fascist Italy. The Ministry of Popular Culture soon shut the publication down because of its left-wing ideas.

Monicelli later returned to Tuscany to complete his studies with the department of Literature and Philosophy of the University of Pisa. He delayed his graduation until he was drafted into the army. Monicelli later said: &quot;dressing as a soldier was enough to get your degree; you didn&#x27;t even need to write a dissertation, nor anything else [...] That&#x27;s how my graduation went, I even doubt the worth of my degree.&quot;

In 1934 he shot his first cinematographic experiment, together with the then architecture student Alberto Lattuada who provided the scenography and Alberto Mondadori. Their short film, Cuore Rivelatore, was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story of the same name (The Tell-tale Heart). The three sent it to the Littorali national cultural festival, but it wasn&#x27;t shown because it was branded as an example of &quot;paranoid cinema&quot;.

=== Breakthrough ===

Always with his friend Alberto Mondadori, he released the silent film &quot;I ragazzi della Via Paal&quot; (an adaptation of the novel &quot;The Paul Street Boys&quot;), which was an award-winner in the Venice Film Festival. The award earned Monicelli the opportunity to work in the production of a professional film. He was therefore able to skip the various stages of professional training and was sent, together with Mondadori, to work as a camera assistant in the production of Gustav Machatý&#x27;s film &quot;Ballerine&quot;.

After that he found work, as a camera assistant again, in Augusto Genina&#x27;s film &quot;Lo squadrone bianco&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Castiglioni Brothers&quot; (1937) by Corrado D&#x27;Errico. There he met Giacomo Gentilomo, who hired him as an assistant director and co-writer for &quot;Short Circuit&quot; (1943), considered as a possible precursor to the &quot;giallo&quot; genre.

In 1937, under the pseudonym of Michele Badiek, he wrote and directed the amateur film &quot;Summer Rain&quot; (1937). The film was attended by many friends and fellow citizens. Monicelli said that this experience was important for his training, as he learned to

From 1939 to 1942, he produced up to 40 numerous screenplays, and worked as an assistant director.

In 1940 Monicelli enlisted in the cavalry, hoping that this choice could avoid him being sent to Russia or to Africa. When the army broke up in 1943, he fled to Rome, where he remained hidden until the summer of 1944.

In 1946 his father Tomaso committed suicide. Being a journalist and a literary critic, Tomaso Monicelli had dared to criticise the fascist regime, especially after the murder of Giacomo Matteotti in 1924. He was blacklisted and boycotted for his writings and endured a series of failures. Later on, Monicelli said he could understand his father&#x27;s decision.

=== Comedy Italian style ===

Monicelli made his official debut as a director in 1949 along with Steno, with the film &quot;Totò cerca casa&quot;, starring the comedy genius Totò. From the very beginning of his career, Monicelli&#x27;s cinematic style had a remarkable flow to it. The duo produced eight successful movies in four years, including the cult film &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot; (1951) and &quot;Totò a colori&quot; (1952). From 1953 onwards Monicelli worked alone, without leaving his role as a writer of screenplays.

Monicelli&#x27;s career includes some of the masterpieces of Italian cinema. In &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; (1958), featuring the ubiquitous comedian Totò in a side role, he discovered the comical talent of Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni and probably started the new genre of the modern (&quot;Italian-style comedy&quot;). While better known in the English-speaking world under the title &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot;, the actual translation from the Italian is &quot;the usual unknown perpetrators&quot; (closely resembling the famous line from &quot;Casablanca&quot;: &quot;Round up the usual suspects&quot;). The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 31st Academy Awards.

&quot;The Great War&quot; (1959), released one year later, is generally regarded as one of his most successful works, which rewarded Monicelli with a Golden Lion in the Venice Film Festival, and an Academy Award nomination for the Best Foreign Film. The film featured the famous drama actor Vittorio Gassman, the Italian superstar of comedy, Alberto Sordi, and a star of Italian neorealism Silvana Mangano. It excelled in the absence of rhetorical accents and for its sharp, tragicomical sense of history while portraying the Italian defeat during World War I.

Among the difficulties encountered in the production of the films, those related to censorship were particularly strong. The film &quot;Toto and Carolina&quot; (1955) underwent three revisions, because according to the censors, the mere fact that the policeman was played by Totò was tantamount to pillorying the police.

Monicelli received two more Academy Award nominations with &quot;I compagni&quot; (1963), a heartfelt homage to &quot;humanitarian socialism&quot; and &quot;The Girl with the Pistol&quot; (1968), which tackled the themes of bride kidnapping and honor killing, still relevant in the Southern-Italian culture of the time.

&quot;L&#x27;armata Brancaleone&quot; (1966) is another masterpiece of Italian cinema. The film tells the tragicomic tale of a Middle Ages Italian knight, with uncertain nobility and few means but high ideals, self-confidence and pomposity (Vittorio Gassman). The bizarre macaronic Latin-Italian dialogues were devised by Age &amp; Scarpelli, the most renowned writers of Italian comedies, and represent a whole linguistic invention which was followed by &quot;Brancaleone at the Crusades&quot; (1970), and less successfully in &quot;Bertoldo, Bertoldino e Cacasenno&quot; (1984).

&quot;My Friends&quot; (1975), featuring Ugo Tognazzi, Adolfo Celi, Gastone Moschin, Duilio Del Prete and Philippe Noiret, was one of the most successful films in Italy and confirmed Monicelli&#x27;s genius in mixing humour, irony and bitter understanding of the human condition. The film was popular to the point that some lines are today turned into well-established idiomatic expressions (&quot;&quot;la supercazzola&quot;), and even a programming language (&quot;monicelli&quot;&quot;) has been created using a syntax based on film quotes. His 1976 film &quot;Caro Michele&quot; (1976) won him the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 26th Berlin International Film Festival.

Dramatic accents were predominant in the &quot;An Average Little Man&quot; (1977), featuring Alberto Sordi for his first complete dramatic role. Here Monicelli&#x27;s pessimism takes over: the transformation of Italian society was such that it was no longer possible to laugh, believe or hope. This is why it is considered by many critics to be the film that brings the season of Italian-style comedy to a close.

=== Final years ===

He turned again to more cheerful comedy and attention to historical events from a popular, intimate point of view with &quot;Il Marchese del Grillo&quot; (1981), also featuring Alberto Sordi at his best. The film was awarded Monicelli&#x27;s third Silver Bear for Best Director award at the 32nd Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;The Rogues&quot; (1987) was also a historical parody set during Renaissance.

Among the final works by Monicelli are &quot;Let&#x27;s Hope It&#x27;s a Girl&quot; (1986), &quot;Parenti serpenti&quot; (1992) and &quot;Dear Goddamned Friends&quot; (1994), featuring Paolo Hendel. The latter won an Honourable Mention at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival. His 1999 film &quot;Dirty Linen&quot; was entered into the 21st Moscow International Film Festival.

His last feature film was &quot;The Roses of the Desert&quot; (2006), which he directed when he was 91 years old.

In 1991 he received the Golden Lion for Career of the Venice Film Festival. A documentary made by Roberto Salinas and Marina Catucci, &quot;Una storia da ridere, breve biografia di Mario Monicelli&quot;, appeared in 2008.

===Death===
At the age of 90, Monicelli decided to go and live on his own, in order to remain self-sufficient and survive to ageing for a longer time.

He died on 29 November 2010 at the age of 95. He killed himself by jumping from a window of the San Giovanni Hospital in Rome, where he had been admitted a few days earlier for prostate cancer in the terminal stage. He had two daughters, Martina (1967) and Ottavia (1974), from Antonella Salerni. He had a third daughter, Rosa (1988), from his last companion Chiara Rapaccini.

He was an outspoken atheist.

<text>Korporatsioon Vironia (abbreviated korp! Vironia or C!V!) is an Estonian fraternal student society and the oldest student corps in Estonia. The organization is named after the Latin name for the ancient Estonian county of Virumaa. A full member of the organization is called a &quot;vironus&quot; (abbr. &quot;vir!&quot;), while every member can also be called a &quot;Vironian&quot; (&quot;viroonlane&quot;).

== History ==
Vironia was officially founded at the Riga Polytechnical Institute on as the very first ethnic Estonian student corps. It remained the only Estonian student corps in Riga and became also the only Estonian member of the two Baltic German corps federations (&quot;Chargierten-Convent&quot;) in the Baltic governorates. Vironia was also the initiator and the co-founder of the League of Estonian Corporations (EKL) in 1915.

After a brief evacuation to Moscow during World War I in 1915 and a short return to Riga in 1918, Vironia entered the Estonian War of Independence &quot;in corpore&quot;. 6 of its members died in the war and one died of war injuries after the war. It was reactivated in Tartu, Estonia in 1920 and opened a second chapter in Tallinn in 1936. 

After being banned following the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in 1940, it opened 8 colonies abroad in 6 Western countries and there was also unofficial activity in Venezuela. Underground activity in occupied Estonia was restored in the 1960s and the chapters in Tallinn and Tartu were legally restored in 1989. 

Today, Vironia has more than 550 members worldwide, being among the biggest Estonian student organizations. Active chapters are in Tallinn and Tartu in Estonia, Toronto, and the US West Coast.

==Foreign relations==
Vironia retains good relations with all non-Baltic German members of the former Riga &quot;Chargierten-Convent&quot;:
* (1879, Polish, currently in Warsaw)
* (1880, Baltic Russian, separate colony in Tartu)
* (1880, Latvian)
* (1883, Polish, currently in Warsaw)
* (1900, Latvian)

Of these, Vironia also has cartel agreements with Welecja (signed 1936) and Fraternitas Arctica (signed 2010). Vironia has also signed cartel agreements with the Karjalainen Osakunta in Helsinki (1930) and is currently an active member of the League of Estonian Corporations, having also signed a cartel agreement with Fraternitas Estica (2009). Unofficial relations since the exile period are retained with the Västmanlands-Dala Nation in Uppsala, Sweden, and since the 2010s with in Kaunas, Lithuania.

<text>The Empress Hotel(formerly the Empress of India Hotel) is a pub located at 714 Nicholson Street, in the inner Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North. The Empress Hotel closed in December 2013, and reopened in its current form in early 2015.

==History==
The pub was opened in 1873 by John Bourke, and named in honour of Queen Victoria, who had been proclaimed the Empress of India on 1 January 1877. Until the late 20th century, it was frequented by employees of the nearby North Fitzroy tram depot.

In the late 1980s, it became a live music venue, and played a part in the Melbourne indie rock scene through the 90s and 2000s. In its last decade as a music venue, hotel management had to deal with noise complaints from residents who had moved nearby without realising it was a music venue. In February 2015 the venue reopened with a traditional bar, a dining area and an open air beer garden.

<text>Bernard Patrick Morris (August 21, 1890 – May 16, 1963) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played for the Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) from 1915 to 1923. When the Metropolitans became the first U.S.-based team to win the Stanley Cup in 1917, Morris scored 14 of Seattle&#x27;s goals (in a best-of-five series). Morris also played for the Calgary Tigers, Boston Bruins, and various minor league teams.

==Playing career==
Born in Brandon, Manitoba, Morris played for several senior teams in Manitoba and Saskatchewan before joining the Victoria Aristocrats of the PCHA in 1914. He moved over to Seattle the following season, played eight seasons for Seattle, and was a member of the Stanley Cup champion 1917 team. He had an outstanding 1917 series, scoring 14 goals in four games.

Morris was scheduled to play in the ill-fated 1919 series, but was arrested by the United States for alleged draft dodging and jailed. He received a sentence of two years, to be served at Alcatraz. The fact that he was a British subject did not stop the American authorities from arresting him, as by treaty, he was supposed to register for the draft (then claim exemption), but he neglected to attend his physical, thus making him the &quot;first foreign national on the West Coast convicted of draft evasion.&quot; By fall he was transferred to an Army unit and in March 1920 granted an honourable discharge.

Morris returned to hockey after the 1919–20 season and played in the 1920 series for Seattle.

In October 1923, Morris was traded by Seattle to the Calgary Tigers. He played for the Tigers in the 1924 series against Montreal. In all, Morris played a season and a half with Calgary before being traded again. He was traded to the Montreal Maroons and then to the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL) on January 3, 1925. He was released by Boston in February 1925, and he returned west to play for the Regina Capitals.

From 1925 to 1930, Morris finished his career with various teams in the minor California Pro League, Can-Pro, and International League. Morris managed the Hamilton Tigers during the 1928–1929 and 1929–1930 seasons. He made his home in Hamilton, Ontario and did not move to Syracuse when the team was transferred there in 1930.

<text>The Dixon Ticonderoga Company () is an American manufacturer of office and art supplies based in Heathrow, Florida. A subsidiary of Italian-based F.I.L.A. SpA, the company offers a number of brands, with one of the most well-known being &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;: the yellow No. HB 2 pencil known for its distinctive green and yellow ferrule. Other brands include Dixon and Oriole pencils, Dixon Industrial products, Prang school and art supplies, and Lyra and Pacon art products.

==History==
The company was formed by the merger of Joseph Dixon Crucible Company of New Jersey with Bryn Mawr Corporation of Pennsylvania, dating to 1795. The company was founded by Joseph Dixon and his son. Dixon also acquired 200-year-old German-based manufacturer Lyra. The pencil&#x27;s name originates in the graphite ore discovered on Lead Hill in 1815 and processed in Ticonderoga, New York.

In 2002, the company closed down its Sandusky, Ohio factory shifting the manufacturing operations to Mexico. In 2005, the company was acquired by F.I.L.A., a manufacturer of school and art supplies based in Milan, Italy, and announced the closure of its main US factory in Versailles, Missouri. The company retains a distribution center in Georgia, where it makes limited numbers of pencils in order to claim status as a domestic producer, and a headquarters facility in Heathrow, Florida.

A consultant and former director of business development for the Dixon Ticonderoga company has been Lee Corso (who is better known as a sports broadcaster on ESPN). According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, his on-air trademark is waving a pencil to punctuate his speech.

==Ticonderoga pencil==
The classic &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; is a wood-cased graphite pencil. It is well known for having a characteristic yellow color, a green (originally brass) metallic ferrule, and a soft pink eraser. The pencil has a mild hexagonal shape that slows surface rolling. Its thickness is approximately 7mm, and its unsharpened length is 19 cm. The Ticonderoga was traditionally manufactured from Eastern red cedar, but it is now made from an unspecified American cedar.

The eponymous Ticonderoga model pencil is distributed by the Dixon Ticonderoga Company. The company, which was originally located in downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, was founded in the 19th century. In 1999, Dixon ceased US production of the Ticonderoga pencil, but it continues to own and operate facilities outside the US in Italy, France, Asia, Latin America and Germany.

Dixon Ticonderoga manufactures a variety of pencils, including the Classic, Black, Noir, Tri-Conderoga, Microban, Laddie, My First (formerly Beginners), SenseMatic, and colored pencils. The pencils are available in different grades: #1 (Extra Soft), #2 (Soft), #2½ (Medium), #3 (Hard), and #4 (Extra Hard).

Ticonderoga pencils were the favorite pencil of the author Roald Dahl. Dahl began using them, along with yellow lined legal pads, whilst living in the U.S., and upon returning home to the U.K. had them specially shipped over for use in his writing shed at Gipsy House, his home in Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="1049533" wikidata="Q720287" url="?curid=1049533" title="Mental Ray">
<text>Mental Ray (stylized as mental ray) is a production-quality ray tracing application for 3D rendering. Its Berlin-based developer Mental Images was acquired by Nvidia in 2007 and Mental Ray was discontinued in 2017.

Mental Ray has been used in many feature films, including &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded &amp; Revolutions&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Poseidon&quot;.

In November 2017 Nvidia announced that it would no longer offer new Mental Ray subscriptions, although maintenance releases with bug fixes were published throughout 2018 for existing plugin customers.

==Features==

The primary feature of Mental Ray is the achievement of high performance through parallelism on both multiprocessor machines and across render farms. The software uses acceleration techniques such as scanline for primary visible surface determination and binary space partitioning for secondary rays via ray tracing, and used Quasi-Monte Carlo methods to solve the underlying light transport simulation. It also supports caustics and physically correct simulation of global illumination employing photon maps. Any combination of diffuse, glossy (soft or scattered), and specular reflection and transmission can be simulated.

Mental Ray was designed to be integrated into a third-party application using an API or be used as a standalone program using the .mi scene file format for batch-mode rendering. There were many programs integrating it such as Autodesk Maya, 3D Studio Max, Cinema 4D and Revit, SoftimageXSI, Side Effects Software&#x27;s Houdini, SolidWorks and Dassault Systèmes&#x27; CATIA. Most of these software front-ends provided their own library of custom shaders (described below). However assuming these shaders are available to mental ray, any .mi file can be rendered, regardless of the software that generated it.

Mental Ray is fully programmable and infinitely variable, supporting linked subroutines also called shaders written in C or C++. This feature can be used to create geometric elements at runtime of the renderer, procedural textures, bump and displacement maps, atmosphere and volume effects, environments, camera lenses, and light sources.

Supported geometric primitives include polygons, subdivision surfaces, and trimmed free-form surfaces such as NURBS, Bézier, and Taylor monomial.

Phenomena consist of one or more shader trees (DAG). A phenomenon looks like regular shader to the user, and in fact may be a regular shader, but generally it will contain a link to a shader DAG, which may include the introduction or modification of geometry, introduction of lenses, environments, and compile options. The idea of a Phenomenon is to package elements and hide complexity.

Since 2010 Mental Ray has also included the iray rendering engine, which added GPU acceleration to the product. In 2013, the ambient occlusion pass was also accelerated by CUDA, and in 2015 the GI Next engine was added which can be used to compute all indirect/global illumination on GPUs.

In 2003, Mental Images received an Academy Award for contributions of mental ray to motion pictures.

* PhotoWorks (ray tracing software), previously part of SolidWorks which used a version of the Mental Ray rendering engine as its renderer in older versions.

<text>ZF Friedrichshafen AG, also known as ZF Group, originally &quot;Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen&quot; (), and commonly abbreviated to ZF, is a German technology manufacturing company that supplies systems for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and industrial technology. It is headquartered in Friedrichshafen, in the south-west German state of Baden-Württemberg. Specializing in engineering, it is primarily known for its design, research and development, and manufacturing activities in the automotive industry and is one of the largest automotive suppliers in the world. Its products include driveline and chassis technology for cars and commercial vehicles, along with specialized plant equipment such as construction equipment. It is also involved in the rail, marine, defense and aviation industries, as well as general industrial applications. ZF has 162 production locations in 31 countries with approximately 168,700 (2023) employees.

==History==

The company was founded by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the inventor of the zeppelin airship and engineer Alfred von Soden-Fraunhofen in 1915 in Friedrichshafen, Germany as a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin, to manufacture gears for zeppelins and other airships. The German &quot;Zahnradfabrik&quot; translates to &#x27;gear factory&#x27; or &quot;cogwheel factory&#x27; in English. 

In 1999, the steering systems division was made separate and became the new ZF Lenksysteme GmbH, a joint venture between ZF Friedrichshafen and Robert Bosch GmbH. 

Due to the 2008 financial crisis ZF took a €250 million loan from the state-owned KfW Bank and embarked on a company-wide restructure that shut down unprofitable locations, particularly outside Germany, the total number of employees was reduced from 63,000 to 59,000 worldwide. CEO Hans-Georg Härter stated that the combined effects of the loan and restructuring will eliminate the need for further employee reduction. 

On 16 September 2014, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that ZF agreed to acquire TRW Automotive Holdings for $13.5 billion. The acquisition would create the world&#x27;s second largest automotive parts concern, ranked just behind Robert Bosch GmbH. For clearing way to acquire TRW Automotive Holdings, ZF Friedrichshafen AG sold its stake in ZF Lenksysteme GmbH to Robert Bosch GmbH. ZF Lenksysteme GmbH has now been renamed as Robert Bosch Automotive Steering GmbH. 

In September 2020, ZF Friedrichshafen AG entered a partnership with Aeva Inc. to put LIDAR sensors for self-driving vehicles, into production.

<text>The World Climate Conferences are a series of international meetings, organized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), about global climate issues principally global warming in addition to climate research and forecasting.

== Conferences ==

=== 1979 ===

The First World Climate Conference was held on 12–23 February 1979 in Geneva and sponsored by the WMO. It was one of the first major international meetings on climate change. Essentially a scientific conference, it was attended by scientists from a wide range of disciplines. In addition to the main plenary sessions, the conference organized four working groups to look into climate data, the identification of climate topics, integrated impact studies, and research on climate variability and change. The Conference led to the establishment of the World Climate Programme and the World Climate Research Programme. It also led to the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by WMO and UNEP in 1988.

=== 1990 ===

The Second Climate Conference was held on 29 October to 7 November 1990, again in Geneva. It was an important step towards a global climate treaty and somewhat more political than the first conference. The main task of the conference was to review the WCP set up by the first conference. The IPCC first assessment report had been completed in time for this conference. The scientists and technology experts at the conference issued a strong statement highlighting the risk of climate change. The conference issued a Ministerial Declaration only after hard bargaining over a number of difficult issues; the declaration disappointed many of the participating scientists as well as some observers because it did not offer a high level of commitment. Eventually, however, developments at the conference led to the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), of which the Kyoto Protocol is a part, and to the establishment of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), a global observing system of systems for climate and climate-related observations.

=== 2009 ===

World Climate Conference-3 (WCC-3) was held in Geneva, Switzerland, 31 August – 4 September 2009. Its focus was on climate predictions and information for decision-making at the seasonal to multi-decadal timescales. The goal was to create a global framework that will link scientific advances in these climate predictions and the needs of their users for decision-making to better cope with changing conditions. Key users of climate predictions include food producers, water managers, energy developers and managers, public health workers, national planners, tourism managers and others, as well as society at large. Participants in WCC-3 included these users, as well as climate service providers and high-level policy-makers. The Conference also aimed to increase commitment to, and advancements in, climate observations and monitoring to better provide climate information and services worldwide that will improve public safety and well-being.

WCC-3 outcomes also intended to contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and broader UN climate goals, including the Hyogo Framework for Action on Disaster Risk Reduction. The Conference theme complemented global work under way to help societies adapt to climate change in line with Bali Action Plan, especially the Nairobi Work Programme. The outcomes formed part of WMO input to the 2009 UNFCC COP-15 meeting for climate mitigation in Copenhagen in the December following WCC-3.

<doc id="1049556" wikidata="Q3073715" url="?curid=1049556" title="Bicep curl">
<text>Bicep curls are a group of weight training exercises in which a person bends their arm towards their body at the elbow in order to make their biceps stronger.

==Overview==
The bicep curl mainly targets the biceps brachii, brachialis and brachioradialis muscles. The biceps is stronger at elbow flexion when the forearm is supinated (palms turned upward) and weaker when the forearm is pronated. The brachioradialis is at its most effective when the palms are facing inward, and the brachialis is unaffected by forearm rotation. Therefore, the degree of forearm rotation affects the degree of muscle recruitment between the three muscles.

=== Form ===

Typically, a bicep curl begins with the arm fully extended with a supinated (palms facing up) grip on a weight. A full repetition consists of bending or &quot;curling&quot; the elbow until it is fully flexed, then slowly lowering the weight to the starting position. The torso should remain upright instead of swinging back and forth, as doing so transfers the load away from the biceps and onto other muscles, reducing the effectiveness of the exercise. The elbows are also usually kept stationary at the side of the torso, as allowing the elbows to move in front of the weight&#x27;s center of gravity removes tension on the biceps before full contraction is achieved.

To maximize the activation of biceps, conducting this exercise using the full range of motion is generally recommended. But for advanced trainers, they can apply a different variation of range in order to acquire some particular emphasis muscle activation. Some may argue that the tension on muscle is most significant during the mid-range, practice bicep curl with a half range of motion to let muscle generate the most force. 

The research found that the preacher curl targets the long head of the biceps significantly only when the arm was almost fully extended, and the range of motion was short. On the other hand, the incline dumbbell curl and the regular bicep curl activated the biceps throughout the entire range of motion. They may be more effective in maximizing the biceps activation.

==Types==

There are several types of bicep curls that use varying equipment, forms, and volume. But the general idea is still to target the biceps activation. Below are some typical variations using common equipment that are prevalent among trainers.

===Dumbbells===
*Dumbbell incline curl: With an adjustable bench positioned at a 45-degree angle, one could perform incline bicep curls with dumbbells. Incline bicep curls are usually performed with lighter weight compare to regular bicep curls, and by sitting on the incline bench, holding the dumbbells close to the body with elbows tucked in, then performing a full curl.
* Supine dumbbell curl: To lay down supinely on a flat bench, with a dumbbell in each hand using the neutral grip (two palms facing each other). And hang down both arm until enough tension is imposed on the shoulder. Simultaneously raise the dumbbells while supinating the wrists until biceps are fully contracted. Then drop the dumbbells to the initial position for another repetition.
* Dumbbell preacher curl: Sit on a preacher bench and adjust the seat height to a comfortable position. Keep the back of upper arms tightly attached to the preacher bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Flex the elbows until they are almost fully extended and curl the dumbbells towards shoulder until the biceps are fully contracted. Then return the dumbbells to the initial position for another repetition.
* Dumbbell reverse curl: Pronate both wrists into a shoulder-width reverse grip and grip the dumbbells in a standing position. Keep elbows stationary and curl the dumbbells towards shoulder until the biceps are fully contracted. Then drop the weight back to the starting position for another repetition.

===Barbells===

* Barbell preacher curl: Sit on a preacher bench and adjust the seat height to an optimal position. Keep the back of upper arms tightly attached to the preacher bench with a barbell hold by both hands. Flex the elbows until they are almost fully extended and curl the barbell towards shoulder until the biceps are fully contracted. Then return the barbell to the initial position for another repetition.
* Barbell reverse curl: Hold the barbell in a standing position with a shoulder-width reverse grip. Tuck the elbows to the side of the torso and keep the scapula pressed, so the shoulders remain stable. Drive the barbell towards the shoulder until the biceps are fully contracted. Then return the barbell to starting position for another repetition.
* Prone incline barbell curl: This variation is also known as the &quot;spider curl&quot; Trainers first need to lay down on an incline bench face towards the floor. Then holds a barbell with a shoulder-width supinated grip. Drive the barbell up while keeping the upper arms fixed to maintain the elbow position. Squeeze biceps to maximize contraction, then drop the barbell to the starting position for another repetition.
* Drag curl: Hold the barbell with shoulder-width underhand grip in a standing position. In this variation, the elbow doesn&#x27;t need to be fixed. Instead, elbow flexion is the fundamental idea. Drive the barbell vertically up towards shoulder while elbows travel back as elbow flex. Then drive elbows forward when the forearms are beyond the chest. Raise the forearms until they are perpendicular to the torso, then drop the barbell back to the starting position for another repetition.

=== Comparison of dumbbells vs. barbells for bicep curls ===
Dumbbells isolate muscles and allow wider range of motion.

On the other hand, barbells stabilize the body and allow for heavier loading. 

The choice between the two boils down to following key considerations:

* Upper arm workout goals: isolation (dumbbells) or stability/strength (barbells).
* Workout Variety for balanced arm development.
* Experience, comfort level and personal preference.

==== Advantages of dumbbells ====
* Prioritize isolation and a full range of motion.
* Address muscle imbalances between the arms.
* Target muscles from different angles.
* Focus on muscle definition and overall arm aesthetics.

==== Advantages of barbells ====
* Gain more stability and control.
* Build strength and progressively lift heavier weights.
* Start Simple and prefer working with one piece of equipment.
* Balance muscle development and symmetry.

=== Cable machine ===
* Overhead cable curl: Stand in the middle of a cable machine with two pulleys in shoulder-height level, grasp a stirrup handle in each hand. Raise both upper arms parallel with shoulders, and supinate the forearms to let the palms facing the torso. Drive the stirrups inwards until biceps are fully contracted, then return the stirrups to starting position for another repetition.
* Cable curl: Hold the bar that is attached to a pulley at the lowest level in a standing position, step a foot back from the pulley to create a comfortable angle for this exercise. Raise the bar toward the shoulder until the biceps are fully tightened, maintaining the elbows at the side of the body and the shoulders fixed. Return the bar back to the initial position for another repetition.
* Lying high cable curl: Lie prone on a bench that is under a cable machine with pulley at the highest level. Grasp a bar that is attached to the pulley with a shoulder-width grip, and fully extend to elbows. Keep the upper arms fixed and curl the bar towards the forehead until the elbow is fully flexed. Then return the bar to starting position for another repetition.

=== Body weight ===
* Body weight curl: Grip under a bar, rings or suspension trainer whilst using a supinated grip and place your feet on the floor. Now curl your neck towards the bar, ring or suspension trainer whilst performing forearm flexion. The position of the feet can be manipulated to change the difficulty of the exercise.

== Injuries ==
Injuries can occur due to incorrect form, careless mistakes, or &quot;ego lifting&quot;. The most common injury caused by bicep curls is a tear of the biceps tendon. There are two main causes of biceps tendon tears: excessive weight and overuse. Ego lifting is an attempt to lift weights that are heavier than the weightlifter&#x27;s capability. During ego lifting, the lifter&#x27;s form will be twisted because the weight is too heavy, and if the weight is far beyond the lifter&#x27;s strength, then there is a likelihood to suffer from biceps tears.

Another injury caused by bicep curls is ulnar neuropathy, which lead to ulnar nerve conduction slowing at the elbow. This is caused by compression of the nerves against a weight bench during the exercise. Though unlikely, bicep curl can cause a rupture of the pectoralis major muscle, which is a severe injury that occurs in the chest.

<doc id="1049561" wikidata="Q26709" url="?curid=1049561" title="Hollow structural section">
<text>A hollow structural section (HSS) is a type of metal profile with a hollow cross section. The term is used predominantly in the United States, or other countries which follow US construction or engineering terminology.

HSS members can be circular, square, or rectangular sections, although other shapes such as elliptical are also available. HSS is only composed of structural steel per code.

HSS is sometimes mistakenly referenced as &quot;hollow structural steel&quot;. Rectangular and square HSS are also commonly called &quot;tube steel&quot; or &quot;box section&quot;. Circular HSS are sometimes mistakenly called &quot;steel pipe&quot;, although true steel pipe is actually dimensioned and classed differently from HSS. (HSS dimensions are based on exterior dimensions of the profile; pipes are also manufactured to an exterior tolerance, albeit to a different standard.) The corners of HSS are heavily rounded, having a radius which is approximately twice the wall thickness. The wall thickness is uniform around the section.

In the UK, or other countries which follow British construction or engineering terminology, the term &quot;HSS&quot; is not used. Rather, the three basic shapes are referenced as CHS, SHS, and RHS, being circular, square, and rectangular hollow sections. Typically, these designations will also relate to metric sizes, thus the dimensions and tolerances differ slightly from HSS.

==Use in structures==
HSS, especially rectangular sections, are commonly used in welded steel frames where members experience loading in multiple directions. Square and circular HSS have very efficient shapes for this multiple-axis loading as they have uniform geometry along two or more cross-sectional axes, and thus uniform strength characteristics. This makes them good choices for columns. They also have excellent resistance to torsion.

HSS can also be used as beams, although &quot;wide flange&quot; or I-beam shapes are in many cases a more efficient structural shape for this application. However, the HSS has superior resistance to lateral torsional buckling.

The flat square surfaces of rectangular HSS can ease construction, and they are sometimes preferred for architectural aesthetics in exposed structures, although elliptical HSS are becoming more popular in exposed structures for the same aesthetic reasons.

In the recent past, HSS was commonly available in mild steel, such as A500 grade B. Today, HSS is commonly available in mild steel, A500 grade C. Other steel grades available for HSS are A847 (weathering steel), A1065 (large sections up to 50 inch sq made with SAW process), and recently approved A1085 (higher strength, tighter tolerances than A500).

==Manufacture==
Square HSS is made the same way as pipe. During the manufacturing process flat steel plate is gradually changed in shape to become round where the edges are presented ready to weld. The edges are then welded together to form the mother tube. During the manufacturing process the mother tube goes through a series of shaping stands which form the round HSS (mother tube) into the final square or rectangular shape. Most American manufacturers adhere to the ASTM A500 or newly adopted ASTM A1085 standards, while Canadian manufacturers follow both ASTM A500 and CSA G40.21. European hollow sections are generally in accordance with the EN 10210 standard.

==Filled HSS==
HSS is often filled with concrete to improve fire rating, as well as robustness. When this is done, the product is referred to as a &quot;Lally column&quot; after its inventor John Lally of Waltham, Massachusetts. (The pronunciation is often corrupted to &quot;lolly column&quot;.) For example, barriers around parking areas (bollards) made of HSS are often filled, to at least bumper height, with concrete. This is an inexpensive (when replacement costs are factored in) way of adding compressive strength to the bollard, which can help prevent unsightly local denting, though it does not generally significantly increase the overall structural properties of the bollard.

<doc id="1049565" wikidata="Q214188" url="?curid=1049565" title="List of Scottish monarchs">
<text>The monarch of Scotland was the head of state of the Kingdom of Scotland. According to tradition, Kenneth I MacAlpin () was the founder and first King of the Kingdom of Scotland (although he never held the title historically, being King of the Picts instead).

The Kingdom of the Picts just became known as the Kingdom of Alba in Scottish Gaelic, which later became known in Scots and English as &quot;Scotland&quot;; the terms are retained in both languages to this day. By the late 11th century at the very latest, Scottish kings were using the term , or King of Scots, to refer to themselves in Latin. The Kingdom of Scotland was merged with the Kingdom of England to form a single Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Thus, Queen Anne became the last monarch of the ancient kingdoms of Scotland and England and the first of Great Britain, although the kingdoms had shared a monarch since 1603 (see Union of the Crowns). Her uncle Charles II was the last monarch to be crowned in Scotland, at Scone in 1651. He had a second coronation in England ten years later.

==Heraldry==

==List of monarchs of Scotland==
===House of Alpin (848–1034)===
The reign of Kenneth MacAlpin begins what is often called the House of Alpin, an entirely modern concept. The descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin were divided into two branches; the crown would alternate between the two, the death of a king from one branch often hastened by war or assassination by a pretender from the other. Malcolm II was the last king of the House of Alpin; in his reign, he successfully crushed all opposition to him and, having no sons, was able to pass the crown to his daughter&#x27;s son, Duncan I, who inaugurated the House of Dunkeld.

*Eochiad was a son of Run, King of Strathclyde, but his mother was a daughter of Kenneth I. Evidence of his reign is unclear. He may have never actually been king and if he was, he was co-king with Giric.

¤Amlaíb is known only by a reference to his death in 977, which reports him as King of Alba; since Kenneth II is known to have still been King in 972–973, Amlaíb must have taken power between 973 and 977.

===House of Dunkeld (1034–1040)===

Duncan succeeded to the throne as the maternal grandson of Malcolm II. The House of Dunkeld was therefore closely related to the House of Alpin. Duncan was killed in battle by Macbeth, another maternal grandson of Malcolm II.

===House of Moray (1040–1058)===

Macbeth came to power in 1040 after killing Duncan I in battle and had a long and relatively successful reign. Macbeth was a cousin of Duncan and was a maternal grandson of Malcolm II. In a series of battles between 1057 and 1058, Duncan&#x27;s son Malcolm III defeated and killed Macbeth and Macbeth&#x27;s stepson and heir Lulach and became the king, thereby passing the throne back to the House of Dunkeld. 

===House of Dunkeld (restored) (1058–1286)===

In a series of battles between 1057 and 1058, Duncan&#x27;s son Malcolm III defeated and killed Macbeth and Macbeth&#x27;s stepson and heir Lulach, claiming the throne. The dynastic feuds did not end there: on Malcolm III&#x27;s death in battle, his brother Donald III, known as &quot;Bán&quot;, claimed the throne, expelling Malcolm III&#x27;s sons from Scotland. A civil war in the family ensued, with Donald III (later supported by Malcolm III&#x27;s son Edmund) opposed by Malcolm III&#x27;s other sons, led first by Duncan II and then by Edgar and backed by the Kingdom of England. Edgar triumphed, sending his uncle and brother to monasteries. After the reign of David I, the Scottish throne was passed according to rules of primogeniture, moving from father to son, or where not possible, brother to brother. Alexander III was the last ruler from the house of Dunkeld, and having no sons, the throne was inherited by his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway.

===House of Sverre (1286–1290)===

Margaret, Maid of Norway inherited the throne in 1286, but died in 1290 in Orkney on her way to be crowned. During her absence, Scotland was ruled by a set of guardians. After her death, Scotland entered a period of interregnum, where 13 contenders fought for the throne and ultimately, John Balliol succeeded.

The status of Margaret, as a Scottish monarch is debated by historians. She was never crowned, and her contemporaries in Scotland described her as &quot;queen&quot; very rarely, referring to her instead as Scotland&#x27;s &quot;lady&quot;, &quot;heir&quot;, or &quot;lady and heir&quot;. On the other hand, documents issued from late 1286 no longer refer to the &quot;king whosoever he may be&quot;, indicating that the throne may have been regarded as already occupied by Margaret. In modern historiography she is nearly unanimously called &quot;queen&quot;, and reference books give 19 March 1286, the date of Alexander III&#x27;s death, as the start of her reign.

=== First Interregnum (1286–1292) ===

The First Interregnum began upon the death of Alexander III of Scotland in 1286. Alexander&#x27;s only surviving descendant was his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway, a young child, who inherited the throne in 1286. A set of guardians were appointed to rule Scotland in her absence since she was living in Norway where her father Eric II was king. She was finally sent to Scotland in 1290 but died before arriving in Scotland. The next king of Scots was not determined until completion of an arbitration in 1292.

===House of Balliol (1292–1296)===

The death of Margaret of Norway began a two-year interregnum in Scotland caused by a succession crisis. With her death, the descent of William I became extinct and there was no obvious heir. Thirteen candidates presented themselves; the most prominent were John Balliol, great-grandson of William I&#x27;s younger brother David of Huntingdon, and Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, grandson of David of Huntingdon. The Scottish magnates invited Edward I of England to arbitrate the claims. He did so but forced the Scots to swear allegiance to him as overlord. Eventually, it was decided that John Balliol should become king. He proved weak and incapable and, in 1296, was forced to abdicate by Edward I who then attempted to annex Scotland into the Kingdom of England.

===Second Interregnum (1296–1306)===

John Balliol abdicated in March 1296. That same month Edward I invaded Scotland. The second set of guardians were appointed under Edward I who ruled from 1296 to 1306, until the election of Robert the Bruce as the king of Scotland.

===House of Bruce (1306–1371)===

For ten years, Scotland had no king. The Scots, however, refused to tolerate English rule. First William Wallace and Andrew Moray, then John Comyn, and finally Robert the Bruce (the grandson of the 1292 competitor, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale who in turn was the grandson of David of Huntingdon, younger brother of William I) fought against the English. Bruce and his supporters had murdered their rival to the throne of Scotland, John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, on 10 February 1306 at Greyfriars Church in Dumfries. Shortly after in 1306, Robert was crowned King of Scots at Scone. Robert Bruce was then hunted down for his crime of murder, and subsequently, he escaped to the outskirt islands, leaving the country completely leaderless, and the English invaded once again. Bruce returned a year later and gained support for his cause. His energy, and the corresponding replacement of the vigorous Edward I with his weaker son Edward II in 1307, allowed Scotland to free itself from English rule. At the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, the Scots routed the English, and by 1328 the English had agreed by treaty to accept Scottish independence. Robert&#x27;s son, David, acceded to the throne as a child. The English renewed their war with Scotland, and David was forced to flee the kingdom by Edward Balliol, son of King John, who managed to get himself crowned (1332–1356) and to give away Scotland&#x27;s southern counties to England before being driven out again. David spent much of his life in exile, first in freedom with his ally, France, and then in prison in England. He was only able to return to Scotland in 1357. Upon his death, childless, in 1371, the House of Bruce came to an end.

===House of Balliol (Disputed claimant) (1332–1356)===
Edward Balliol was the son of King John Balliol, who had himself ruled for four years following his election in the Great Cause. Following his abdication, John Balliol lived out his life in obscurity in Picardy, France. During the minority of David II, Edward Balliol seized the opportunity to assert his claim to the throne, and backed by the English, he defeated the forces of David&#x27;s regency and was himself crowned king at Scone in 1332. He was quickly defeated by loyalist forces and sent back to England. With English support, he would mount two more attempts to seize the throne again, in 1333 and 1335, each time his actual control of the throne was brief before being sent back to England, for the last time in 1336. When David returned from exile in 1341 to rule in his own right, Edward lost most of his support. When David II was captured in battle in 1346, Edward made one last attempt to seize the throne for himself but had little support and the campaign fizzled before it gained much traction. In 1356 he renounced all claims to the throne.

===House of Stewart/Stuart (1371–1651)===
Robert the Stewart was a grandson of Robert I by the latter&#x27;s daughter, Marjorie. Having been born in 1316, he was older than his uncle, David II. Consequently, he was at his accession a middle-aged man, already 55, and unable to reign vigorously, a problem also faced by his son Robert III, who also ascended in middle age at 53 in 1390, and suffered lasting damage in a horse-riding accident. These two were followed by a series of regencies, caused by the youth of the succeeding five boy kings. Consequently, the Stewart era saw periods of royal inertia, during which the nobles usurped power from the crown, followed by periods of personal rule by the monarch, during which he or she would attempt to address the issues created by their minority and the long-term effects of previous reigns. Governing Scotland became increasingly difficult, as the powerful nobility became increasingly intractable. James I&#x27;s attempts to curb the disorder of the realm ended in his assassination. James III was killed in a civil war between himself and the nobility, led by his son. When James IV, who had governed sternly and suppressed the aristocrats, died in the Battle of Flodden, his wife Margaret Tudor, who had been nominated regent for their young son James V, was unseated by noble feuding, and James V&#x27;s wife, Mary of Guise, succeeded in ruling Scotland during the regency for her young daughter Mary I only by dividing and conquering the noble factions, distributing French bribes with a liberal hand. Finally, Mary I, the daughter of James V, found herself unable to govern Scotland faced with the surliness of the aristocracy and the intransigence of the population, who favored Calvinism and disapproved of her Catholicism. She was forced to abdicate, and fled to England, where she was imprisoned in various castles and manor houses for eighteen years and finally executed for treason against the English queen Elizabeth I. Upon her abdication, her son, fathered by Henry, Lord Darnley, a junior member of the Stewart family, became King as James VI.

James VI became King of England and Ireland as James I in 1603 when his cousin Elizabeth I died. Thereafter, although the two crowns of England and Scotland remained separate, the monarchy was based chiefly in England. Charles I, James&#x27;s son, found himself faced with the Civil War. The resultant conflict lasted eight years and ended in his execution. The English Parliament then decreed their monarchy to be at an end. The Scots Parliament, after some deliberation, broke their links with England and declared that Charles II, son, and heir of Charles I, would become King. He ruled until 1651 when the armies of Oliver Cromwell occupied Scotland and drove him into exile.

===Third Interregnum (1651–1660)===
===House of Stuart (restored) (1660–1707)===
With the Scottish Restoration, the Stuarts became Kings of Scotland once more but Scotland&#x27;s rights were not respected. During the reign of Charles II, the Scottish Parliament was dissolved and James was appointed Governor of Scotland. James II himself became James VII in 1685. His Catholicism was not tolerated, and he was driven out of England after three years. In his place came his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, the ruler of the Dutch Republic. The two were accepted as monarchs of Scotland after a period of deliberation by the Scottish Parliament and ruled together as William II and Mary II.

An attempt to establish a Scottish colonial empire through the Darien Scheme, in rivalry to that of England, failed, leaving the Scottish nobles who financed the venture for their profit bankrupt. This coincided with the accession of Queen Anne, daughter of James VII. Anne had multiple children but none of these survived her, leaving as her heir her half-brother, James, then living in exile in France. The English favored the Protestant Sophia of Hanover (a granddaughter of James VI) as heir. Many Scots preferred Prince James, who as a Stuart was a Scot by ancestry, and threatened to break the Union of Crowns between England and Scotland by choosing him for themselves. To preserve the union, the English elaborated a plan whereby the two Kingdoms of Scotland and England would merge into a single Kingdom, the Kingdom of Great Britain, ruled by a common monarch, and with a single Parliament. Both national parliaments agreed to this (the Scots albeit reluctantly, motivated primarily by the national finances), and some subterfuge as a total majority of signatories were needed to ratify the Scottish parliament&#x27;s assent, bribes, and payments. Thereafter, although monarchs continued to rule over the nation of Scotland, they did so first as monarchs of Great Britain, and from 1801 of the United Kingdom.

==Acts of Union==
The Acts of Union were twin Parliamentary Acts passed during 1706 and 1707 by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, agreed on 22 July 1706, following prolonged negotiation between Queen Anne&#x27;s Commissioners representing both parliaments. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland to form a united Kingdom of Great Britain.

Scotland and England had shared a common monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603 when the Scottish king James VI succeeded to the English throne. Although described as a Union of Crowns, before the Acts of Union of 1707, the crowns of the two separate kingdoms had rested on the same head. Three unsuccessful attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) were made to unite the two kingdoms by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments to succeed, thereby bringing the two separate states together under a single parliament as well as a single monarch.

==Later claimants==

James VII continued to claim the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. When he died in 1701, his son James inherited his father&#x27;s claims and called himself James VIII of Scotland and III of England and Ireland. He would continue to do so all his life, even after the Kingdoms of England and Scotland were ended by their merging as the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1715, a year after the death of his half-sister, Queen Anne, and the accession of their cousin George of Hanover, James landed in Scotland and attempted to claim the throne. He failed and was forced to flee back to the Continent. A second attempt by his son Charles, on behalf of his father, in 1745–6, also failed. Both James&#x27;s children died without legitimate issue, bringing the Stuart family to an end.

*&quot;James VIII&quot;, also known as &quot;The Old Pretender&quot;, son of James VII, was claimant from 1701 until he died in 1766.
*&quot;Charles III&quot;, also known as &quot;The Young Pretender&quot; and often called &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, son of James VIII, was claimant from his father&#x27;s death until his death in 1788 without legitimate issue.
*&quot;Henry I&quot;, brother of Charles III and youngest son of James VIII. Died unmarried in 1807.

After 1807, the Jacobite claims passed first to the House of Savoy (1807–1840), then to the Modenese branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (1840–1919), and finally to the House of Wittelsbach (since 1919). The current heir is Franz, Duke of Bavaria. Neither he nor any of his predecessors since 1807 have pursued their claim.

In 1971, Ugandan President Idi Amin proclaimed himself to be the uncrowned king of Scotland, although this claim gained no international recognition.

And we shall be careful to root out all Heretics and Enemies to the true Worship of God, that shall be convicted by the true Kirk of God, of the aforesaid Crimes, out of our Lands and Empire of Scotland. And we faithfully affirm the Things above-written by our solemn Oath.

<doc id="1049569" wikidata="Q5065095" url="?curid=1049569" title="Certificate of Loss of Nationality">
<text>The Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States (CLN) is form DS-4083 of the Bureau of Consular Affairs of the United States Department of State which is completed by a consular official of the United States documenting relinquishment of United States nationality. The form is prescribed by the Secretary of State under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.

A CLN is used only to document a loss of U.S. nationality and it does not affect the loss of U.S. nationality itself. However some provisions of U.S. regulations require a CLN be issued in order to recognize a person as a non-U.S. national even if as a matter of law that person is already probably not a U.S. national. One example of this are FATCA provisions as currently adopted in the US Code of Federal Regulations.

CLNs are applied for and issued at a U.S. consulate or embassy. Persons lacking an alternate nationality or refusing to declare one at the time of application may be listed as being stateless on their CLN. Unlike other countries, the United States allows persons to renounce their citizenship even when that person would become stateless upon loss of United States nationality.

<doc id="1049572" wikidata="Q3359194" url="?curid=1049572" title="Oz (magazine)">
<text>Oz was an independently published, alternative/underground magazine associated with the international counterculture of the 1960s. While it was first published in Sydney in 1963, a parallel version of &quot;Oz&quot; was published in London from 1967. The Australian magazine was published until 1969 and the British version until 1973.

The central editor, throughout the magazine&#x27;s life in both countries, was Richard Neville. Co-editors of the Sydney version were Richard Walsh and Martin Sharp. Co-editors of the London version were Jim Anderson and, later, Felix Dennis, and then Roger Hutchinson.

In both Australia and the UK, the creators of &quot;Oz&quot; were prosecuted on charges of obscenity. A 1963 charge was dealt with expeditiously when, upon the advice of a solicitor, the three editors pleaded guilty. In two later trials, one in Australia in 1964 and the other in the UK in 1971, the magazine&#x27;s editors were acquitted on appeal, after initially being found guilty and sentenced to harsh jail terms.

==&quot;Oz&quot; in Australia==
===Launch===

The original Australian editorial team included university students Neville, Walsh and Sharp, and Peter Grose, a cadet journalist from Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Other early contributors included art critic Robert Hughes and future author Bob Ellis. Neville, Walsh and Sharp had each been involved in student magazines at their respective Sydney tertiary campuses: Neville had edited the University of New South Wales student magazine &quot;Tharunka&quot;, Walsh edited its University of Sydney counterpart &quot;Honi Soit&quot; and Sharp had contributed to the short-lived student magazine &quot;The Arty Wild Oat&quot; while studying at the National Art School in East Sydney. Influenced by the radical comedy of Lenny Bruce, Neville and friends decided to found a &quot;magazine of dissent&quot;.

The 16-page first issue, published on April Fools&#x27; Day 1963, caused a sensation, selling 6,000 copies by lunchtime of publication day. It parodied the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; (and was even printed on &quot;The Herald&quot;&#x27;s own presses, adding to its credibility) and led with a front-page hoax about the collapse of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It also featured a centre spread on the history of the chastity belt and a story on abortion – based on Neville&#x27;s own experience of arranging a termination of pregnancy for a girlfriend; abortion was then still illegal in New South Wales. These stories though, would soon lead to the magazine&#x27;s first round of obscenity charges, but there were also more immediate consequences. As a result of the controversy generated by the abortion story, the Sydney &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; cancelled its advertising contract, it also threatened to sack Peter Grose from his cadetship unless he resigned from &quot;Oz&quot; and the Maritime Services Board evicted &quot;Oz&quot; from its office in The Rocks.

===Early issues and first obscenity charge===
In succeeding issues (and in its later London version) &quot;Oz&quot; gave pioneering coverage to contentious issues such as censorship, homosexuality, police brutality, the Australian government&#x27;s White Australia policy and Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, as well as regularly satirising public figures, up to and including Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies.

In mid-1963, shortly after the publication of issue No.3, Neville, Walsh and Grose were summoned on charges of distributing an obscene publication; the shock of the charges caused Walsh&#x27;s deeply religious father to suffer a serious heart attack, so their family solicitor arranged for the case to be adjourned until September 1963 but he advised the trio that, as first offenders, they could avoid having their conviction recorded if they pleaded guilty.

Word soon went around the publishing trade; after their current printers pulled Issue 4 from the presses Neville shopped around for a new printer but he was turned down by a dozen other companies until, on Sharp&#x27;s advice, he approached maverick writer-publisher Francis James, editor of the &quot;Anglican Press&quot;, who agreed to take it on. When Neville, Walsh and Grose appeared in court on 3 September 1963 the Walshes&#x27; solicitor pleaded guilty on their behalf; each was fined £20 and their convictions were recorded, an outcome that was to have serious repercussions in their second trial.

With end-of-year exams looming, &quot;Oz&quot; issue No.5 was postponed until the Christmas break. When eventually issued, it included a scathing satire on the ongoing police harassment of gay people. &quot;The Stiff Arm of the Law&quot; (which became a regular feature on police misconduct) featured a parody of a police report in which incriminating sections of a supposed account of an officer&#x27;s real actions in a gay-bashing incident were crossed out and replaced with far more anodyne language, e.g. in the line &quot;I was at Phillip Street Station in my homo hunting togs&quot;, the words &quot;homo hunting togs&quot; were crossed out and replaced with the handwritten words &quot;plain clothes&quot;, &quot;this little bastard&quot; with &quot;a youth&quot;, and &quot;I myself punched him several times&quot; was amended to read &quot;I was punched several times&quot;, and so on. As a result of this perceived slight to their integrity, police seized 140 copies of &quot;Oz&quot; from a Kings Cross, NSW newsagent and took them to a magistrate, who ordered them to be burned.

Two other items in these early issues incurred the wrath of the NSW police. One was Martin Sharp&#x27;s ribald satirical poem about youths gatecrashing a party, entitled &quot;The Word Flashed Around The Arms&quot;; the other was the &quot;Oz&quot; No.6 cover photograph (pictured at right), which depicted Neville and others pretending to urinate into a wall fountain created by sculptor Tom Bass, which was mounted in the street facade of the Sydney offices of the P&amp;O shipping line and which had recently been unveiled by Prime Minister Menzies.

===Second obscenity charge===
In April 1964 Neville, Walsh and Sharp were again charged with obscenity, but the situation was greatly complicated by the fact that they had already pleaded guilty in their first trial, and this previous conviction would count heavily against them in sentencing if they were found guilty on the new charges. As soon as the case began they were confronted by the blatant bias and hostility of the magistrate hearing the case, Mr Gerald Locke, SM.

To the dismay of the &quot;Oz&quot; team and their friends and family, Locke decided to make an example of them, sentencing them to three to six months in prison with hard labour, but they were released on bail pending an appeal. Their supporters decided to raise money for the defence fund with a benefit concert, which was held at the Sydney University Theatre on 15 November 1964, featuring Sydney garage-punk band The Missing Links, members of the popular satirical TV sketch series &quot;The Mavis Bramston Show&quot; and actor Leonard Teale (then starring in the popular TV police drama &quot;Homicide&quot;), who recited a &quot;surfie&quot; parody of &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot;.

The case created a storm of controversy, but the convictions were overturned on appeal mainly because – as in their subsequent British trial – the appeal judge found that Locke had misdirected the jury and made remarks that were found to have been prejudicial to the defence&#x27;s case.

===Sydney&#x27;s underworld===
In subsequent issues &quot;Oz&quot; made several investigations into the murky realms of Sydney&#x27;s underworld. One celebrated feature delved into the illegal abortion rackets which were then flourishing in Sydney (and around Australia), because at that time abortion was still illegal for all but the most exceptional cases, and corrupt police were widely believed to be running lucrative protection rackets that netted them substantial sums.

In 1965 &quot;Oz&quot; editor Richard Neville had a close encounter with Sydney&#x27;s alleged &quot;Mr Big&quot; of organised crime, Lenny McPherson, a notorious criminal who was at that time well on his way to becoming Sydney&#x27;s most powerful underworld figure, thanks in part to a systematic program of public assassinations of his rivals.

Late in the year, &quot;Oz&quot; published a feature called &quot;The Oz Guide to Sydney&#x27;s Underworld&quot;, which was based on information from two local journalists, and which included a &quot;top 20&quot; list of Sydney major criminals. The list deliberately left the number 1 spot blank, but at number 2 was the name &quot;Len&quot; (i.e. McPherson) who was described as a &quot;fence&quot; and a &quot;fizz-gig&quot; (police informant). Soon after the list was published, McPherson made a visit to Neville&#x27;s house in Paddington, NSW; ostensibly he wanted to find out whether the &quot;Oz&quot; editors were part of a rival gang, but he also made it clear to Neville that he objected to being described as a &quot;fizz&quot;.

The Top 20 list also reportedly played a part in the death of Sydney criminal Jacky Steele, who was shot in Woollahra in November 1965. Steele – who had been trying to take over protection rackets controlled by McPherson – survived for almost a month before dying from his wounds, but before he died he told police that McPherson had ordered his execution because Steele had bought multiple copies of &quot;Oz&quot; and had made great play of the fact that McPherson was not number 1. &quot;Oz&quot; revealed this in a subsequent issue, which contained extracts from the minutes of a confidential meeting of Sydney detectives, held on 1 December 1965, which had been leaked to the magazine by an underworld source.

===&quot;Oz&quot; in Australia ends===
Sharp and Neville left for London in February 1966, while Walsh returned to his studies. He continued to publish a reduced edition of Sydney &quot;Oz&quot;, which ran until 1969 and included material submitted by Neville and Sharp from London. In the 1970s he edited &quot;POL&quot; magazine and &quot;Nation Review&quot;, and later became managing director of leading Australian media company Australian Consolidated Press, owned by Kerry Packer.

==&quot;Oz&quot; in the UK==

In early 1966 Neville and Sharp travelled to the UK and in early 1967, with fellow Australian Jim Anderson, they founded the London &quot;Oz&quot;. Contributors included Germaine Greer, artist and filmmaker Philippe Mora, illustrator Stewart Mackinnon, photographer Robert Whitaker, journalist Lillian Roxon, cartoonist Michael Leunig, Angelo Quattrocchi, Barney Bubbles and David Widgery.

With access to new print stocks, including metallic foils, new fluorescent inks and the freedom of layout offered by the offset printing system, Sharp&#x27;s artistic skills came to the fore and &quot;Oz&quot; quickly won renown as one of the most visually exciting publications of its day. Several editions of &quot;Oz&quot; included dazzling psychedelic wrap-around or pull-out posters by Sharp, London design duo Hapshash and the Coloured Coat and others; these instantly became sought-after collectors&#x27; items and now command high prices. Another innovation was the cover of &quot;Oz&quot; No.11, which included a collection of detachable adhesive labels, printed in either red, yellow or green. The all-graphic &quot;Magic Theatre&quot; edition (&quot;Oz&quot; No.16, November 1968), overseen by Sharp and Mora, has been described by British author Jonathon Green as &quot;arguably the greatest achievement of the entire British underground press.&quot; During this period Sharp also created the two famous psychedelic album covers for the group Cream, &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; and &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;.

Sharp&#x27;s involvement gradually decreased during 1968-69 and the &quot;Magic Theatre&quot; edition was one of his last major contributions to the magazine. In his place, young Londoner Felix Dennis, who had been selling issues on the street, was eventually brought in as Neville and Anderson&#x27;s new partner. The magazine regularly enraged the British establishment with a range of left-field stories including heavy critical coverage of the Vietnam War and the anti-war movement, discussions of drugs, sex and alternative lifestyles, and contentious political stories, such as the magazine&#x27;s revelations about the torture of citizens under the rule of the military junta in Greece.

===UK obscenity trial and appeal===
In 1970, reacting to criticism that &quot;Oz&quot; had lost touch with youth, the editors put a notice in the magazine inviting &quot;school kids&quot; to edit an issue. The opportunity was taken up by around 20 secondary school students (including Charles Shaar Murray and Deyan Sudjic), who were responsible for &quot;Oz&quot; No.28 (May 1970), generally known as &quot;Schoolkids Oz&quot;. This term was widely misunderstood to mean that it was intended for schoolchildren, whereas it was an issue that had been created by them. As Richard Neville said in his opening statement, other issues had been assembled by gay people and members of the Female Liberation Movement. One of the resulting articles was a highly sexualised Rupert Bear parody. It was created by 15-year-old schoolboy Vivian Berger by pasting the head of Rupert onto the lead character of an X-rated satirical cartoon by Robert Crumb.

&quot;Oz&quot; was one of several &#x27;underground&#x27; publications targeted by the Obscene Publications Squad, and their offices had already been raided on several occasions, but the conjunction of schoolchildren and what some viewed as obscene material set the scene for the &quot;Oz&quot; obscenity trial of 1971. In one key respect it was a virtual re-run of the second Australian trial – the judicial instruction was clearly aimed at securing a conviction, and like Gerald Locke in Sydney, the judge hearing the London case, Judge Michael Argyle, exhibited signs of bias against the defendants. However the British trial was given a far more dangerous edge because the prosecution employed an archaic charge against Neville, Dennis and Anderson—&quot;conspiracy to corrupt public morals&quot;—which, in theory, carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
After being turned down by several leading lawyers, Dennis and Anderson secured the services of barrister and writer John Mortimer, QC (creator of the &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; series) who was assisted by his Australian-born junior counsel Geoffrey Robertson; Neville chose to represent himself. At the opening of the trial in June 1971 Mortimer stated that &quot;... [the] case stands at the crossroads of our liberty, at the boundaries of our freedom to think and draw and write what we please&quot;.

To enable them to focus on their defence, they engaged the Australian journalist (and future Labor politician) Peter Steedman as managing editor.

For the defence, this specifically concerned the treatment of dissent and dissenters, about the control of ideas and suppressing the messages of social resistance communicated by &quot;Oz&quot; in issue No.28. The charges read out in the central criminal court stated &quot;[that the defendants] conspiring with certain other young persons to produce a magazine containing obscene, lewd, indecent and sexually perverted articles, cartoons and drawings with intent to debauch and corrupt the morals of children and other young persons and to arouse and implant in their minds lustful and perverted ideas&quot;. According to Mr Brian Leary, prosecuting, &quot;It dealt with homosexuality, lesbianism, sadism, perverted sexual practices and drug taking&quot;.

John Lennon and Yoko Ono joined the protest march against the prosecution and organised the recording of &quot;God Save Us&quot; by the ad hoc group Elastic Oz Band to raise funds and gain publicity. Lennon explained how the song title changed from &quot;God Save Oz&quot; to &quot;God Save Us&quot;.

The trial was, at the time, the longest obscenity trial in British legal history, and it was the first time that an obscenity charge was combined with the charge of conspiring to corrupt public morals. Defence witnesses included clinical psychologist Lionel Haward, artist Feliks Topolski, comedian Marty Feldman, artist and drugs activist Caroline Coon, DJ John Peel, musician and writer George Melly, legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin and academic Edward de Bono.

At the conclusion of the trial the &quot;Oz Three&quot; were found not guilty on the conspiracy charge, but they were convicted of two lesser offences and sentenced to imprisonment; although Dennis was given a lesser sentence because the judge, Michael Argyle, considered that Dennis was &quot;very much less intelligent&quot; than the others. Shortly after the verdicts were handed down, they were taken to prison and their long hair forcibly cut, an act which caused an even greater stir on top of the already considerable outcry surrounding the trial and verdict.

The best known images of the trial come from the committal hearing, at which Neville, Dennis and Anderson all appeared, wearing rented schoolgirl costumes.

At the appeal trial (where the defendants appeared wearing long wigs) it was found that Judge Argyle had grossly misdirected the jury on numerous occasions and the defence also alleged that Berger, who was called as a prosecution witness, had been harassed and assaulted by police. The convictions were overturned. Years later, Felix Dennis told author Jonathon Green that on the night before the appeal was heard, the &quot;Oz&quot; editors were taken to a secret meeting with the Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, who reportedly said that Argyle had made a &quot;fat mess&quot; of the trial, and informed them that they would be acquitted, but insisted that they had to agree to give up work on &quot;Oz&quot;. Dennis also stated that, in his opinion, MPs Tony Benn and Michael Foot had interceded with Widgery on their behalf.

Despite their supposed undertaking to Lord Widgery, &quot;Oz&quot; continued after the trial, and thanks to the intense public interest the trial generated, its circulation briefly rose to 80,000. However its popularity faded over the next two years and by the time the last issue (&quot;Oz&quot; No.48) was published in November 1973 &quot;Oz&quot; Publications was £20,000 in debt and the magazine had &quot;no readership worth the name&quot;.
==Legacy==
Partly because of its suppression by both Australian and British authorities (many editions of London &quot;Oz&quot; were banned in Australia), copies of both incarnations of the magazine are now rare and the British issues command high prices among collectors – individual copies of the most sought-after editions are now worth several hundred pounds each.

Dennis was stung by personal comments made by the trial judge that he was of limited ability and a dupe of the other defendants; he later became one of Britain&#x27;s wealthiest and most prominent independent publishers as owner of Dennis Publishing (publisher of &quot;Maxim&quot; and other magazines), and in 2004 released a book of original poetry. In 1995, Justice Argyle reiterated allegations about Dennis in &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine. As this was outside court privilege, Dennis was able to successfully sue the magazine, which agreed to pay £10,000 to charity. Dennis refrained from suing Argyle personally: &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t want to make him a martyr of the Right: there&#x27;s no glory to be had in suing an 80-year-old man and taking his house away from him. It was just a totally obvious libel.&quot;

Neville eventually returned to Australia, where he has become a successful author, commentator and public speaker, later styling himself as a &quot;futurist&quot;. His books include &quot;The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobraj&quot; (1979), a critically praised account of the life of French/Vietnamese serial killer Charles Sobhraj, who preyed on Western tourists travelling on Asia&#x27;s so-called &quot;hippie trail&quot; in the 1970s; the book was later adapted for a successful TV mini-series starring Art Malik. In the 1990s, &quot;Hippie Hippie Shake&quot;, a memoir of his years with &quot;Oz&quot;, was published. In 2007, Beeban Kidron directed a film adaptation which was to have been released in 2010. The film starred Cillian Murphy as Neville, Chris O&#x27;Dowd as Dennis, Max Minghella as Martin Sharp, Sienna Miller as Neville&#x27;s girlfriend Louise Ferrier and Emma Booth as Germaine Greer (who vehemently repudiated the movie in her &quot;Guardian&quot; column). , the movie was noted in the Internet Movie Database as having been &quot;abandoned&quot;.

Richard Walsh became the founding editor of Gareth Powell&#x27;s &quot;POL&quot; magazine, editor of the weekly newspaper &quot;Nation Review&quot;, and chief executive of the major Australian publishing and bookselling firm Angus &amp; Robertson. In 1986, he was appointed as director and publisher of Kerry Packer&#x27;s Australian Consolidated Press organisation, eventually managing a stable of over 70 magazines.

Martin Sharp has long been regarded as Australia&#x27;s leading pop artist and is well known in Australia for his passionate interest in Sydney&#x27;s Luna Park and in the life and music of Tiny Tim.

&quot;Oz&quot; was parodied in the short-lived 1999 UK television series &quot;Hippies&quot;.

==Digital collections==

In 2014 the University of Wollongong Library, in collaboration with Richard Neville, made available on open access a complete set of digital copies of &quot;Oz Sydney&quot; magazine and &quot;Oz London&quot; magazine.

<text>James Gordon Letwin (born July 2, 1952) is an American software developer and one of the eleven early Microsoft employees who posed for an iconic staff portrait taken in Albuquerque in 1978.

Prior to joining Microsoft, he worked for Heathkit, porting &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; to the computer and working on HDOS and Benton Harbor BASIC.

Letwin&#x27;s first project at Microsoft was writing a BASIC compiler. He is most noted for being the lead architect of the OS/2 operating system on the Microsoft side, with Ed Iacobucci being the lead architect from IBM&#x27;s side. Letwin contributed much of the design and code for several core components, including the HPFS file system.

Letwin left Microsoft in 1993 to &quot;kick back&quot; with his wife. While at Microsoft he had become a millionaire, with a 2000 &quot;Time&quot; article estimating his worth at around $20 million. Since leaving Microsoft, Letwin has donated substantial amounts of money to environmental causes via the Wilburforce Foundation, a charitable foundation created by him and his wife, Rose.

<text>Celtophile Records was a Danbury, Connecticut-based sublabel of Green Linnet Records that specialized in budget compilations of Celtic music. The label was started in 1997 in Danbury, Connecticut by Green Linnet owner Wendy Newton. It operated until 2006, when Newton sold Green Linnet to Digital Music Group, an aggregator of downloadable music. DMG in turn sold the rights to manufacture and distribute Green Linnet to Compass Records, which still markets the Green Linnet catalog.

<text>Ballykissangel is a BBC television drama created by Kieran Prendiville and set in Ireland, produced in-house by BBC Northern Ireland. The original story revolved around a young English Roman Catholic priest as he became part of a rural community. It ran for six series, which were first broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom from 11 February 1996 to 15 April 2001. It aired in Ireland on RTÉ One and in Australia on ABC TV from 1996 to 2001. Repeats have been shown on Drama in the United Kingdom and the series also has been shown in the United States on some PBS affiliates.

The series was made and set during the Celtic Tiger economic period in Ireland and this features mainly through Tony Doyle’s character, Brian Quigley. The show is also set amid the backdrop of the Catholic Church scandal and explores controversial themes of the time such as divorce (which had only been legalised a year before the series began), and pre-marital sex. Dervla Kirwan’s and Niall Toibin’s characters are often at odds, symbolising the social conflict between traditional Ireland and social liberalisation.

Significant changes in the cast occurred at the end of series 3 following the departure of central characters Peter Clifford and Assumpta Fitzgerald. A band of new characters were brought in and characters that previously had little story were expanded, such as Kathleen, Niamh, Frank and Brian.

The show faced a decline in ratings from a peak level of 10 million viewers to 4.8 million and was eventually cancelled in 2001.

The name of the fictional village in which the show was set is derived from Ballykissane, a townland near Killorglin in County Kerry, where the show&#x27;s creator, Kieran Prendiville, holidayed with his family as a child. The village&#x27;s name in Irish is shown as &quot;Baile Coisc Aingeal&quot;, which means &quot;The town of the fallen angel&quot;, on the sign outside the post office.

The show was filmed in Avoca and Enniskerry in County Wicklow.

<doc id="1049586" wikidata="Q281140" url="?curid=1049586" title="Moon Treaty">
<text>The Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, better known as the Moon Treaty or Moon Agreement, is a multilateral treaty that turns jurisdiction of all celestial bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the participant countries. Thus, all activities would conform to international law, including the United Nations Charter.

It has not been ratified by any state that engages in self-launched human spaceflight (e.g. the United States, Russia (or its predecessor the Soviet Union), or the People&#x27;s Republic of China) since its creation on December 18, 1979, and thus it has little to no relevancy in international law. , 17 states are parties to the treaty.

==Objective==
It was noted that since the 1967 Outer Space Treaty was signed, technologies and society evolved, requiring a redefinition of the rights and responsibilities of citizens and governments alike in the use and development of outer space. The primary stated objective of the 1979 Moon Treaty is &quot;to provide the necessary legal principles for governing the behavior of states, international organizations, and individuals who explore celestial bodies other than Earth, as well as administration of the resources that exploration may yield.&quot; It proposed to do so by having the state parties produce an &quot;international regime&quot; that would establish the appropriate procedures (Article 11.5).

==Provisions==
The Moon Treaty proposes to establish an &quot;international regime&quot; or &quot;framework of laws&quot; that apply to the Moon and to other celestial bodies within the Solar System, including orbits around or other trajectories to or around them.

The Moon Treaty lays several provisions outlined in 21 articles. In Article 11, the treaty makes a declaration that the Moon should be used for the benefit of all states and all peoples of the international community. It reiterates that lunar resources are &quot;not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.&quot; It also expresses a desire to prevent the Moon from becoming a source of international conflict, so that the resources should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. To those ends, the treaty lays several provisions, and some of these are paraphrased below:

*Bans any military use of celestial bodies, including weapon testing, nuclear weapons in orbit, or military bases. The use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited. (Article 3.4)
*Provides a framework of laws to establish an international cooperation regime, including appropriate procedures, to govern the responsible exploitation of natural resources of the Moon. (Article 11.5)
*Bans altering the environmental balance of celestial bodies and requires that states take measures to prevent accidental contamination of the environments of celestial bodies, including Earth. (Article 7.1)
*The orderly and safe use of the natural lunar resources with an equitable sharing by all state parties in the benefits derived from those resources. (Article 11.7)
*The placement of personnel or equipment on or below the surface shall not create a right of ownership. (Article 11)
*There shall be freedom of scientific research and exploration and use on the Moon by any party without discrimination of any kind. (Article 6) Samples obtained during research activities, are hoped to be made available to all countries and scientific communities for research. (Article 6.2)
*Any areas or regions reported to have a special scientific interest, shall be designated as international scientific preserves. (Article 7.3)
*Shall promptly inform the United Nations and the public of any phenomena which could endanger human life or health, as well as of any indication of extraterrestrial life. (Article 5.3)
*State parties shall ensure that non-governmental entities under their jurisdiction shall engage in activities on the Moon only under the authority and continuing supervision of the appropriate state party. (Article 14)
*All parties shall inform the United Nations as well as the public, of their activities concerned with the exploration and use of the Moon. (Article 5)
*Any state party to this agreement may propose amendments to the agreement. (Article 17)
*Any state party to this agreement may give notice of its withdrawal by written notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It will take effect one year from the date of this notification. (Article 20)

When compared with the Outer Space Treaty, it reiterates most provisions, and adds two new concepts in order to address the exploitation of natural resources in outer space: to apply the concept of &#x27;common heritage of mankind&#x27; to outer space activities, and to have the participating countries produce a regime that lays the appropriate procedures for orderly mining. Multiple conferences produced no consensus on these two items.

==History==

After the 1967 non-armament Outer Space Treaty was signed, it was followed in 1968 with the United Nations convened UNISPACE, the United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. It was the first of a series of UN-sponsored conferences intended to create an international framework of laws to guide humanity&#x27;s use of outer space resources. 

After ten more years of negotiations, the Moon Treaty was created in 1979 as a framework of laws to develop a regime of detailed procedures, and as such, it remained imprecise: its Article 11.5 states that the exploitation of the natural shall be governed by an international regime that would establish the appropriate procedures. In order to define this regime or laws, a series of UN-sponsored conferences took place, but brought no consensus. The continuing disagreement is based mainly over the meaning of &quot;Common Heritage of Mankind&quot; and on the rights of each country to the natural resources of the Moon.

===Ratification===
The treaty was finalized in 1979 and, after satisfying the condition requiring 5 ratifying states, it entered into force for the ratifying parties in 1984. , 18 states are parties to the treaty, seven of which ratified the agreement and the rest acceded. Four additional states have signed but not ratified the treaty. The L5 Society and others successfully opposed signing of the treaty by the United States.

===National considerations===
In the United States on July 29 and 31, 1980, the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space, which was a part of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation held hearings on the Moon Treaty. S. Neil Hosenball was one of the supporters of the treaty, and he attempted to compare the Moon Treaty to mining rights within the United States. Hosenball was unsuccessful in his attempt to convince the committee that the United States should ratify the Moon Treaty. The opposition, led by Leigh Ratiner of the L-5 Society, stated that the Moon Treaty was opposed to free enterprise and private property rights. Ratiner provided a potential solution to the Moon Treaty, and suggested that there should be legal claims to the Moon and &quot;there should be a system to register such claims. By the way, I&#x27;m not speaking of claims to territory...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary for us to deal with the issue of whether one can make a claim to the land itself, as long as one has the exclusive right to use it.&quot;

The last effort culminated in June 2018 after eight years of negotiations, when the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) held a high-level meeting that tried to produce a consensus on a framework of laws for the sustainable development of outer space, but it also failed to do so when S. Neil Hosenball, who is the NASA General Counsel and chief US negotiator for the Moon Treaty, decided that negotiation of the rules of the international regime should be delayed until the feasibility of exploitation of lunar resources has been established.

However since rights to economic benefits are claimed to be necessary to ensure investment in private missions to the Moon, private companies in the US have been seeking clearer national regulatory conditions and guidelines prompting the US government to do so, which subsequently legalized space mining in 2015 by introducing the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015.

Similar national legislations legalizing extraterrestrial appropriation of resources are now being replicated by other nations, including Luxembourg, Japan, China, India and Russia. While the &quot;national&quot; treaty explicitly allows commercial mining, other experts argue that these new national laws are inconsistent with the Moon Treaty and customary international law.

===Implementation agreement===
The controversy on claims and on mining rights for profit have dominated the discussion around the laws governing the Moon.

Experts though have affirmed that the Moon Treaty does allow commercial mining, since it allows extraction after the international regulatory regime, that the Moon Treaty asks for, is put into place. Therefore it is concluded, that the Moon Treaty is incomplete and lacks an &quot;implementation agreement&quot; answering the unresolved issues, particularly regarding resource extraction.

== Legal status ==

While the treaty reiterates the prohibition of sovereignty of &quot;any part&quot; of space, the current imprecision of the agreement, being called unfinished, generated various interpretations, this being cited as the main reason it was not signed by most countries. The treaty proposes that the exploitation of resources shall be governed by an international regime (Article 11.5), but there has been no consensus establishing these laws.

The agreement has been described without fruition and possibly a failure if it remains ratified by few countries, particularly those active in space. Only two countries (France and India) with independent spaceflight capabilities have signed (but not ratified) the treaty.

Echoing legal experts S. Neil Hosenball, who is the NASA General Counsel and chief US negotiator for the Moon Treaty, decided in 2018 that negotiation of the rules of this international regime should be delayed until the feasibility of exploitation of lunar resources has been established. An expert in space law and economics summarized that the treaty would need to offer adequate provisions against any one company acquiring a monopoly position in the world minerals market, while avoiding &quot;the socialization of the Moon.&quot;

In 2020 the Artemis Accords were signed, while not mentioning the treaty, they are nevertheless challenging the treaty. At the time of the signing of the accords U.S. President Donald Trump additionally released an executive order called &quot;Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources.&quot; The order emphasizes that &quot;the United States does not view outer space as a &#x27;global commons&quot; and calls the Moon Agreement &quot;a failed attempt at constraining free enterprise.&quot;

With Australia signing and ratifying both the Moon Treaty as well as the Artemis Accords, there has been a discussion if they can be harmonized. In this light an &quot;Implementation Agreement&quot; for the Moon Treaty has been advocated for, as a way to compensate for the shortcomings of the Moon Treaty and to harmonize it with other laws, allowing it to be more widely accepted.

<doc id="1049596" wikidata="Q899619" url="?curid=1049596" title="Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell">
<text>Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), also known as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, are a type of fuel cell being developed mainly for transport applications, as well as for stationary fuel-cell applications and portable fuel-cell applications. Their distinguishing features include lower temperature/pressure ranges (50 to 100 °C) and a special proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membrane. PEMFCs generate electricity and operate on the opposite principle to PEM electrolysis, which consumes electricity. They are a leading candidate to replace the aging alkaline fuel-cell technology, which was used in the Space Shuttle.

==Science==

PEMFCs are built out of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) which include the electrodes, electrolyte, catalyst, and gas diffusion layers. An ink of catalyst, carbon, and electrode are sprayed or painted onto the solid electrolyte and carbon paper is hot pressed on either side to protect the inside of the cell and also act as electrodes. The pivotal part of the cell is the triple phase boundary (TPB) where the electrolyte, catalyst, and reactants mix and thus where the cell reactions actually occur. Importantly, the membrane must not be electrically conductive so the half reactions do not mix. Operating temperatures above 100 °C are desired so the water byproduct becomes steam and water management becomes less critical in cell design.

===Reactions===

A proton exchange membrane fuel cell transforms the chemical energy liberated during the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to electrical energy, as opposed to the direct combustion of hydrogen and oxygen gases to produce thermal energy.

A stream of hydrogen is delivered to the anode side of the MEA. At the anode side it is catalytically split into protons and electrons. This oxidation half-cell reaction or hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is represented by:

At the anode:
The newly formed protons permeate through the polymer electrolyte membrane to the cathode side. The electrons travel along an external load circuit to the cathode side of the MEA, thus creating the current output of the fuel cell.
Meanwhile, a stream of oxygen is delivered to the cathode side of the MEA. At the cathode side oxygen molecules react with the protons permeating through the polymer electrolyte membrane and the electrons arriving through the external circuit to form water molecules. This reduction half-cell reaction or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is represented by:

At the cathode:
Overall reaction:

The reversible reaction is expressed in the equation and shows the reincorporation of the hydrogen protons and electrons together with the oxygen molecule and the formation of one water molecule. The potentials in each case are given with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode.

===Polymer electrolyte membrane===


To function, the membrane must conduct hydrogen ions (protons) but not electrons as this would in effect &quot;short circuit&quot; the fuel cell. The membrane must also not allow either gas to pass to the other side of the cell, a problem known as gas crossover. Finally, the membrane must be resistant to the reducing environment at the cathode as well as the harsh oxidative environment at the anode.

Splitting of the hydrogen molecule is relatively easy by using a platinum catalyst. Unfortunately however, splitting the oxygen molecule is more difficult, and this causes significant electric losses. An appropriate catalyst material for this process has not been discovered, and platinum is the best option.

==== Strengths ====

1. Easy sealing 

PEMFCs have a thin, polymeric membrane as the electrolyte. This membrane is located in between the anode and cathode catalysts and allows the passage of protons to pass to the cathode while restricting the passage of electrons. Compared to liquid electrolytes, a polymeric membrane has a much lower chance of leakage [2]. The proton-exchange membrane is commonly made of materials such as perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA, sold commercially as Nafion and Aquivion), which minimize gas crossover and short circuiting of the fuel cell. A disadvantage of fluor containing polymers is the fact that during production (and disposal) PFAS products are formed. PFAS, the so-called forever chemicals, are highly toxic. Newer polymers such as the recently patented SPX3 (POLYMERS COMPRISING SULFONATED 2,6-DIPHENYL-1,4-PHENYLENE OXIDE REPEATING UNITS -US 11434329 B2) are fluor free and therefore do not carry the PFAS risk.

2. Low Operating Temperature

Under extreme sub-freezing conditions, the water produced by fuel cells can freeze in porous layers and flow channels. This freezing water can block gas and fuel transport as well as cover catalyst reaction sites, resulting in a loss of output power and a start-up failure of the fuel cell.

However, the low operating temperature of a PEM fuel cell allows it to reach a suitable temperature with less heating compared to other types of fuel cells. With this approach, PEM fuel cells have been shown to be capable of cold start processes from −20°C.

3. Light mass and high power density (transport applications)

PEM fuel cells have been shown to be capable of high power densities up to 39.7 kW/kg, compared to 2.5 kW/kg for solid oxide fuel cells. Due to this high power density, much research is being done on potential applications in transportation as well as wearable technology.

==== Weaknesses ====

Fuel Cells based on PEM still have many issues:

1. Water management

Water management is crucial to performance: if water is evaporated too slowly, it will flood the membrane and the accumulation of water inside of field flow plate will impede the flow of oxygen into the fuel cell, but if water evaporates too fast, the membrane will dry and the resistance across it increases. Both cases will cause damage to stability and power output. Water management is a very difficult subject in PEM systems, primarily because water in the membrane is attracted toward the cathode of the cell through polarization. 

A wide variety of solutions for managing the water exist including integration of an electroosmotic pump.

Another innovative method to resolve the water recirculation problem is the 3D fine mesh flow field design used in the Toyota Mirai, 2014. Conventional design of FC stack recirculates water from the air outlet to the air inlet through a humidifier with a straight channel and porous metal flow fields[54].The flow field is a structure made up of a rib and channels. However, the rib partially covers the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the resultant gas-transport distance is longer than the inter-channel distance. Furthermore, the contact pressure between the GDL and the rib also compresses the GDL, making its thickness non-uniform across the rib and channel[55]. The large width and non-uniform thickness of the rib will increase potential for water vapor to accumulate and the oxygen will be compromised. As a result, oxygen will be impeded to diffuse into catalyst layer, leading to nonuniform power generation in the FC.

This new design enabled the first FC stack functions without a humidifying system meanwhile overcoming water recirculation issues and achieving high power output stability[54]. The 3D micro lattice allows more pathways for gas flow; therefore, it promotes airflow toward membrane electrode and gas diffusion layer assembly (MEGA) and promotes O2 diffusion to the catalyst layer. Unlike conventional flow fields, the 3D micro-lattices in the complex field, which act as baffles and induce frequent micro-scale interfacial flux between the GDL and flow-fields[53]. Due to this repeating micro-scale convective flow, oxygen transport to catalyst layer (CL) and liquid water removal from GDL is significantly enhanced. The generated water is quickly drawn out through the flow field, preventing accumulation within the pores. As a result, the power generation from this flow field is uniform across the cross-section and self-humidification is enabled.

2. Vulnerability of the Catalyst

The platinum catalyst on the membrane is easily poisoned by carbon monoxide, which is often present in product gases formed by methane reforming (no more than one part per million is usually acceptable). This generally necessitates the use of the water gas shift reaction to eliminate CO from product gases and form more hydrogen. Additionally, the membrane is sensitive to the presences of metal ions, which may impair proton conduction mechanisms and can be introduced by corrosion of metallic bipolar plates, metallic components in the fuel cell system or from contaminants in the fuel/oxidant.

PEM systems that use reformed methanol were proposed, as in Daimler Chrysler Necar 5; reforming methanol, i.e. making it react to obtain hydrogen, is however a very complicated process, that also requires purification from the carbon monoxide the reaction produces. A platinum-ruthenium catalyst is necessary as some carbon monoxide will unavoidably reach the membrane. The level should not exceed 10 parts per million. Furthermore, the start-up times of such a reformer reactor are of about half an hour. Alternatively, methanol, and some other biofuels can be fed to a PEM fuel cell directly without being reformed, thus making a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). These devices operate with limited success.

3. Limitation of Operating Temperature

The most commonly used membrane is Nafion by Chemours, which relies on liquid water humidification of the membrane to transport protons. This implies that it is not feasible to use temperatures above 80 to 90 °C, since the membrane would dry. Other, more recent membrane types, based on polybenzimidazole (PBI) or phosphoric acid, can reach up to 220 °C without using any water management (see also High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell, HT-PEMFC): higher temperature allow for better efficiencies, power densities, ease of cooling (because of larger allowable temperature differences), reduced sensitivity to carbon monoxide poisoning and better controllability (because of absence of water management issues in the membrane); however, these recent types are not as common. PBI can be doped with phosphoric or sulfuric acid and the conductivity scales with amount of doping and temperature. At high temperatures, it is difficult to keep Nafion hydrated, but this acid doped material does not use water as a medium for proton conduction. It also exhibits better mechanical properties, higher strength, than Nafion and is cheaper. However, acid leaching is a considerable issue and processing, mixing with catalyst to form ink, has proved tricky. Aromatic polymers, such as PEEK, are far cheaper than Teflon (PTFE and backbone of Nafion) and their polar character leads to hydration that is less temperature dependent than Nafion. However, PEEK is far less ionically conductive than Nafion and thus is a less favorable electrolyte choice. Recently, protic ionic liquids and protic organic ionic plastic crystals have been shown as promising alternative electrolyte materials for high temperature (100–200 °C) PEMFCs.

==== Electrodes ====
An electrode typically consists of carbon support, Pt particles, Nafion ionomer, and/or Teflon binder. The carbon support functions as an electrical conductor; the Pt particles are reaction sites; the ionomer provides paths for proton conduction, and the Teflon binder increases the hydrophobicity of the electrode to minimize potential flooding. In order to enable the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, protons, electrons and the reactant gases (hydrogen or oxygen) must gain access to the surface of the catalyst in the electrodes, while the product water, which can be in either liquid or gaseous phase, or both phases, must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet. These properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder (ionomer) and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles. Typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios (as further described below) reducing the amount of the costly platinum. The polymer electrolyte binder provides the ionic conductivity, while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the electric conductivity and enables low platinum metal loading. The electric conductivity in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity.

====Gas diffusion layer====

The GDL electrically connects the catalyst and current collector. It must be porous, electrically conductive, and thin. The reactants must be able to reach the catalyst, but conductivity and porosity can act as opposing forces. Optimally, the GDL should be composed of about one third Nafion or 15% PTFE. The carbon particles used in the GDL can be larger than those employed in the catalyst because surface area is not the most important variable in this layer. GDL should be around 15–35 μm thick to balance needed porosity with mechanical strength. Often, an intermediate porous layer is added between the GDL and catalyst layer to ease the transitions between the large pores in the GDL and small porosity in the catalyst layer. Since a primary function of the GDL is to help remove water, a product, flooding can occur when water effectively blocks the GDL. This limits the reactants ability to access the catalyst and significantly decreases performance. Teflon can be coated onto the GDL to limit the possibility of flooding. Several microscopic variables are analyzed in the GDLS such as: porosity, tortuosity and permeability. These variables have incidence over the behavior of the fuel cells. 

====Efficiency====
The maximal theoretical efficiency applying the Gibbs free energy equation ΔG = −237.13 kJ/mol and using the heating value of Hydrogen (ΔH = −285.84 kJ/mol) is 83% at 298 K.
: formula_1

The practical efficiency of a PEMs is in the range of 50–60% .
Main factors that create losses are:
* Activation losses
* Ohmic losses
* Mass transport losses

=== Bipolar plates ===
The external electrodes, often referred to as bipolar plates or backplates, serve to distribute fuel and oxygen uniformly to the catalysts, to remove water, to collect and transmit electric current. Thus, they need to be in close contact with the catalyst. Because the plates are in contact with both PEM and catalyst layers, the backplate needs to be structurally tough and leakage-resistant in case of structural failure due to fuel cell vibration and temperature cycling. As fuel cells operate in wide ranges of temperatures and in highly reductive/oxidative environments, plates must have high surface tolerances over the wide ranges of temperatures and should be chemically stable. Since the backplate accounts for more than three-quarters of the fuel cell mass, the material must also be lightweight to maximize the energy density.

Materials that fulfill all of these requirements are often very expensive. Gold has been shown to fulfill these criteria well, but is only used for small production volumes due to its high cost. Titanium nitride (TiN) is a cheaper material that is used in fuel cell backplates due to its high chemical stability, electrical conductivity, and corrosion resistance. However, defects in the TiN coating can easily lead to corrosion of the underlying material, most commonly steel.

To perform their main function of distributing gas and fuel, these plates often have straight, parallel channels across its surface. However, this simple approach has led to issues such as uneven pressure distribution, water droplets blocking gas flow, and output power oscillations. Innovative approaches, such as nature-inspired fractal models and computer simulations are being explored to optimize the function of these bipolar plates.

=== Metal-organic frameworks ===
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of porous, highly crystalline materials that consist of metal nodes connected by organic linkers. Due to the simplicity of manipulating or substituting the metal centers and ligands, there are a virtually limitless number of possible combinations, which is attractive from a design standpoint. MOFs exhibit many unique properties due to their tunable pore sizes, thermal stability, high volume capacities, large surface areas, and desirable electrochemical characteristics. Among their many diverse uses, MOFs are promising candidates for clean energy applications such as hydrogen storage, gas separations, supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, solar cells, and fuel cells. Within the field of fuel cell research, MOFs are being studied as potential electrolyte materials and electrode catalysts that could someday replace traditional polymer membranes and Pt catalysts, respectively.

As electrolyte materials, the inclusion of MOFs seems at first counter-intuitive. Fuel cell membranes generally have low porosity to prevent fuel crossover and loss of voltage between the anode and cathode. Additionally, membranes tend to have low crystallinity because the transport of ions is more favorable in disordered materials. On the other hand, pores can be filled with additional ion carriers that ultimately enhance the ionic conductivity of the system and high crystallinity makes the design process less complex.

The general requirements of a good electrolyte for PEMFCs are: high proton conductivity (&gt;10−2 S/cm for practical applications) to enable proton transport between electrodes, good chemical and thermal stability under fuel cell operating conditions (environmental humidity, variable temperatures, resistance to poisonous species, etc.), low cost, ability to be processed into thin-films, and overall compatibility with other cell components. While polymeric materials are currently the preferred choice of proton-conducting membrane, they require humidification for adequate performance and can sometimes physically degrade due to hydrations effects, thereby causing losses of efficiency. As mentioned, Nafion is also limited by a dehydration temperature of &lt; 100 °C, which can lead to slower reaction kinetics, poor cost efficiency, and CO poisoning of Pt electrode catalysts. Conversely, MOFs have shown encouraging proton conductivities in both low and high temperature regimes as well as over a wide range of humidity conditions. Below 100 °C and under hydration, the presence of hydrogen bonding and solvent water molecules aid in proton transport, whereas anhydrous conditions are suitable for temperatures above 100 °C. MOFs also have the distinct advantage of exhibiting proton conductivity by the framework itself in addition to the inclusion of charge carries (i.e., water, acids, etc.) into their pores.

A low temperature example is work by Kitagawa, et al. who used a two-dimensional oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework as the host and introduced ammonium cations and adipic acid molecules into the pores to increase proton concentration. The result was one of the first instances of a MOF showing &quot;superprotonic&quot; conductivity (8 × 10−3 S/cm) at 25 °C and 98% relative humidity (RH). They later found that increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cations introduced into the pores could enhance proton conductivity even more. In this low temperature regime that is dependent on degree of hydration, it has also been shown that proton conductivity is heavily dependent on humidity levels.

A high temperature anhydrous example is PCMOF2, which consists of sodium ions coordinated to a trisulfonated benzene derivative. To improve performance and allow for higher operating temperatures, water can be replaced as the proton carrier by less volatile imidazole or triazole molecules within the pores. The maximum temperature achieved was 150 °C with an optimum conductivity of 5 × 10−4 S/cm, which is lower than other current electrolyte membranes. However, this model holds promise for its temperature regime, anhydrous conditions, and ability to control the quantity of guest molecules within the pores, all of which allowed for the tunability of proton conductivity. Additionally, the triazole-loaded PCMOF2 was incorporated into a H2/air membrane-electrode assembly and achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.18 V at 100 °C that was stable for 72 hours and managed to remain gas tight throughout testing. This was the first instance that proved MOFs could actually be implemented into functioning fuel cells, and the moderate potential difference showed that fuel crossover due to porosity was not an issue.

To date, the highest proton conductivity achieved for a MOF electrolyte is 4.2 × 10−2 S/cm at 25 °C under humid conditions (98% RH), which is competitive with Nafion. Some recent experiments have even successfully produced thin-film MOF membranes instead of the traditional bulk samples or single crystals, which is crucial for their industrial applicability. Once MOFs are able to consistently achieve sufficient conductivity levels, mechanical strength, water stability, and simple processing, they have the potential to play an important role in PEMFCs in the near future.

MOFs have also been targeted as potential replacements of platinum group metal (PGM) materials for electrode catalysts, although this research is still in the early stages of development. In PEMFCs, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the Pt cathode is significantly slower than the fuel oxidation reaction at the anode, and thus non-PGM and metal-free catalysts are being investigated as alternatives. The high volumetric density, large pore surface areas, and openness of metal-ion sites in MOFs make them ideal candidates for catalyst precursors. Despite promising catalytic abilities, the durability of these proposed MOF-based catalysts is currently less than desirable and the ORR mechanism in this context is still not completely understood.

===Catalyst research===
Much of the current research on catalysts for PEM fuel cells can be classified as having one of the following main objectives:

#to obtain higher catalytic activity than the standard carbon-supported platinum particle catalysts used in current PEM fuel cells
#to reduce the poisoning of PEM fuel cell catalysts by impurity gases
#to reduce the cost of the fuel cell due to use of platinum-based catalysts
#to enhance the ORR activity of platinum group metal-free electrocatalysts

Examples of these approaches are given in the following sections.

====Increasing catalytic activity====

As mentioned above, platinum is by far the most effective element used for PEM fuel cell catalysts, and nearly all current PEM fuel cells use platinum particles on porous carbon supports to catalyze both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction. However, due to their high cost, current Pt/C catalysts are not feasible for commercialization. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that platinum-based catalysts will need to use roughly four times less platinum than is used in current PEM fuel cell designs in order to represent a realistic alternative to internal combustion engines. Consequently, one main goal of catalyst design for PEM fuel cells is to increase the catalytic activity of platinum by a factor of four so that only one-fourth as much of the precious metal is necessary to achieve similar performance.

One method of increasing the performance of platinum catalysts is to optimize the size and shape of the platinum particles. Decreasing the particles&#x27; size alone increases the total surface area of catalyst available to participate in reactions per volume of platinum used, but recent studies have demonstrated additional ways to make further improvements to catalytic performance. For example, one study reports that high-index facets of platinum nanoparticles (that is Miller indexes with large integers, such as Pt (730)) provide a greater density of reactive sites for oxygen reduction than typical platinum nanoparticles.

Since the most common and effective catalyst, platinum, is extremely expensive, alternative processing is necessary to maximize surface area and minimize loading. Deposition of nanosized Pt particles onto carbon powder (Pt/C) provides a large Pt surface area while the carbon allows for electrical connection between the catalyst and the rest of the cell. Platinum is so effective because it has high activity and bonds to the hydrogen just strongly enough to facilitate electron transfer but not inhibit the hydrogen from continuing to move around the cell. However, platinum is less active in the cathode oxygen reduction reaction. This necessitates the use of more platinum, increasing the cell&#x27;s expense and thus feasibility. Many potential catalyst choices are ruled out because of the extreme acidity of the cell.

The most effective ways of achieving the nanoscale Pt on carbon powder, which is currently the best option, are through vacuum deposition, sputtering, and electrodeposition. The platinum particles are deposited onto carbon paper that is permeated with PTFE. However, there is an optimal thinness to this catalyst layer, which limits the lower cost limit. Below 4 nm, Pt will form islands on the paper, limiting its activity. Above this thickness, the Pt will coat the carbon and be an effective catalyst. To further complicate things, Nafion cannot be infiltrated beyond 10 um, so using more Pt than this is an unnecessary expense. Thus the amount and shape of the catalyst is limited by the constraints of other materials.

A second method of increasing the catalytic activity of platinum is to alloy it with other metals. For example, it was recently shown that the Pt3Ni(111) surface has a higher oxygen reduction activity than pure Pt(111) by a factor of ten. The authors attribute this dramatic performance increase to modifications to the electronic structure of the surface, reducing its tendency to bond to oxygen-containing ionic species present in PEM fuel cells and hence increasing the number of available sites for oxygen adsorption and reduction.

Further efficiencies can be realized using an Ultrasonic nozzle to apply the platinum catalyst to the electrolyte layer or to carbon paper under atmospheric conditions resulting in high efficiency spray. Studies have shown that due to the uniform size of the droplets created by this type of spray, due to the high transfer efficiency of the technology, due to the non-clogging nature of the nozzle and finally due to the fact that the ultrasonic energy de-agglomerates the suspension just before atomization, fuel cells MEA&#x27;s manufactured this way have a greater homogeneity in the final MEA, and the gas flow through the cell is more uniform, maximizing the efficiency of the platinum in the MEA.
Recent studies using inkjet printing to deposit the catalyst over the membrane have also shown high catalyst utilization due to the reduced thickness of the deposited catalyst layers.

Very recently, a new class of ORR electrocatalysts have been introduced in the case of Pt-M (M-Fe and Co) systems with an ordered intermetallic core encapsulated within a Pt-rich shell. These intermetallic core-shell (IMCS) nanocatalysts were found to exhibit an enhanced activity and most importantly, an extended durability compared to many previous designs. While the observed enhancement in the activities is ascribed to a strained lattice, the authors report that their findings on the degradation kinetics establish that the extended catalytic durability is attributable to a sustained atomic order.

====Reducing poisoning====

The other popular approach to improving catalyst performance is to reduce its sensitivity to impurities in the fuel source, especially carbon monoxide (CO). Presently, pure hydrogen gas is becoming economical to mass-produce by electrolysis. However, at the moment most hydrogen gas is produced by steam reforming light hydrocarbons, a process which produces a mixture of gases that also contains CO (1–3%), CO2 (19–25%), and N2 (25%). Even tens of parts per million of CO can poison a pure platinum catalyst, so increasing platinum&#x27;s resistance to CO is an active area of research.

For example, one study reported that cube-shaped platinum nanoparticles with (100) facets displayed a fourfold increase in oxygen reduction activity compared to randomly faceted platinum nanoparticles of similar size. The authors concluded that the (111) facets of the randomly shaped nanoparticles bonded more strongly to sulfate ions than the (100) facets, reducing the number of catalytic sites open to oxygen molecules. The nanocubes they synthesized, in contrast, had almost exclusively (100) facets, which are known to interact with sulfate more weakly. As a result, a greater fraction of the surface area of those particles was available for the reduction of oxygen, boosting the catalyst&#x27;s oxygen reduction activity.

In addition, researchers have been investigating ways of reducing the CO content of hydrogen fuel before it enters a fuel cell as a possible way to avoid poisoning the catalysts. One recent study revealed that ruthenium-platinum core–shell nanoparticles are particularly effective at oxidizing CO to form CO2, a much less harmful fuel contaminant. The mechanism that produces this effect is conceptually similar to that described for Pt3Ni above: the ruthenium core of the particle alters the electronic structure of the platinum surface, rendering it better able to catalyze the oxidation of CO.

====Lowering cost====

The challenge for the viability of PEM fuel cells today still remains in their cost and stability. The high cost can in large part be attributed to the use of the precious metal of platinum in the catalyst layer of PEM cells. The electrocatalyst currently accounts for nearly half of the fuel cell stack cost. Although the Pt loading of PEM fuel cells has been reduced by two orders of magnitude over the past decade, further reduction is necessary to make the technology economically viable for commercialization. Whereas some research efforts aim to address this issue by improving the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts, an alternative is to eliminate the use of Pt altogether by developing a non-platinum-group-metal (non-PGM) cathode catalyst whose performance rivals that of Pt-based technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy has been setting milestones for the development of fuel cells, targeting a durability of 5000 hours and a non-PGM catalyst ORR volumetric activity of 300 A cm−3.

Promising alternatives to Pt-based catalysts are Metal/Nitrogen/ Carbon-catalysts (M/N/C-catalysts). To achieve high power density, or output of power over surface area of the cell, a volumetric activity of at least 1/10 that of Pt-based catalysts must be met, along with good mass transport properties. While M/N/C-catalysts still demonstrate poorer volumetric activities than Pt-based catalysts, the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate. However, increasing the loading of M/N/C-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker, impairing its mass transport properties. In other words, H2, O2, protons, and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer, decreasing the voltage output of the cell. While high microporosity of the M/N/C catalytic network results in high volumetric activity, improved mass transport properties are instead associated to macroporosity of the network. These M/N/C materials are synthesized using high temperature pyrolysis and other high temperature treatments of precursors containing the metal, nitrogen, and carbon.

Recently, researchers have developed a Fe/N/C catalyst derived from iron (II) acetate (FeAc), phenanthroline (Phen), and a metal-organic-framework (MOF) host. The MOF is a Zn(II) zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) called ZIF-8, which demonstrates a high microporous surface area and high nitrogen content conducive to ORR activity. The power density of the FeAc/Phen/ZIF-8-catalyst was found to be 0.75 W cm−2 at 0.6 V. This value is a significant improvement over the maximal 0.37 W cm−2 power density of previous M/N/C-catalysts and is much closer to matching the typical value of 1.0–1.2 W cm−2 for Pt-based catalysts with a Pt loading of 0.3 mg cm−2. The catalyst also demonstrated a volumetric activity of 230 A·cm−3, the highest value for non-PGM catalysts to date, approaching the U.S. Department of Energy milestone.

While the power density achieved by the novel FeAc/Phen/ZIF-8-catalyst is promising, its durability remains inadequate for commercial application. It is reported that the best durability exhibited by this catalyst still had a 15% drop in current density over 100 hours in H2/air. Hence while the Fe-based non-PGM catalysts rival Pt-based catalysts in their electrocatalytic activity, there is still much work to be done in understanding their degradation mechanisms and improving their durability.

==Applications==
The major application of PEM fuel cells focuses on transportation primarily because of their potential impact on the environment, e.g. the control of emission of the green house gases (GHG). Other applications include distributed/stationary and portable power generation. Most major motor companies work solely on PEM fuel cells due to their high power density and excellent dynamic characteristics as compared with other types of fuel cells. Due to their light weight, PEMFCs are most suited for transportation applications. PEMFCs for buses, which use compressed hydrogen for fuel, can operate at up to 40% efficiency. Generally PEMFCs are implemented on buses over smaller cars because of the available volume to house the system and store the fuel. Technical issues for transportation involve incorporation of PEMs into current vehicle technology and updating energy systems. Full fuel cell vehicles are not advantageous if hydrogen is sourced from fossil fuels; however, they become beneficial when implemented as hybrids. There is potential for PEMFCs to be used for stationary power generation, where they provide 5 kW at 30% efficiency; however, they run into competition with other types of fuel cells, mainly SOFCs and MCFCs. Whereas PEMFCs generally require high purity hydrogen for operation, other fuel cell types can run on methane and are thus more flexible systems. Therefore, PEMFCs are best for small scale systems until economically scalable pure hydrogen is available. Furthermore, PEMFCs have the possibility of replacing batteries for portable electronics, though integration of the hydrogen supply is a technical challenge particularly without a convenient location to store it within the device.

==History==
Before the invention of PEM fuel cells, existing fuel cell types such as solid-oxide fuel cells were only applied in extreme conditions. Such fuel cells also required very expensive materials and could only be used for stationary applications due to their size. These issues were addressed by the PEM fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell was invented in the early 1960s by Willard Thomas Grubb and Leonard Niedrach of General Electric. Initially, sulfonated polystyrene membranes were used for electrolytes, but they were replaced in 1966 by Nafion ionomer, which proved to be superior in performance and durability to sulfonated polystyrene.

PEM fuel cells were used in the NASA Gemini series of spacecraft, but they were replaced by Alkaline fuel cells in the Apollo program and in the Space Shuttle. General Electric continued working on PEM cells and in the mid-1970s developed PEM water electrolysis technology for undersea life support, leading to the US Navy Oxygen Generating Plant. The British Royal Navy adopted this technology in early 1980s for their submarine fleet. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Los Alamos National Lab and Texas A&amp;M University experimented with ways to reduce the amount of platinum required for PEM cells.

Parallel with Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, General Electric developed the first proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for the Gemini space missions in the early 1960s. The first mission to use PEMFCs was Gemini V. However, the Apollo space missions and subsequent Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab and Space Shuttle missions used fuel cells based on Bacon&#x27;s design, developed by Pratt and Whitney Aircraft.

Extremely expensive materials were used and the fuel cells required very pure hydrogen and oxygen. Early fuel cells tended to require inconveniently high operating temperatures that were a problem in many applications. However, fuel cells were seen to be desirable due to the large amounts of fuel available (hydrogen and oxygen).

Despite their success in space programs, fuel cell systems were limited to space missions and other special applications, where high cost could be tolerated. It was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that fuel cells became a real option for wider application base. Several pivotal innovations, such as low platinum catalyst loading and thin film electrodes, drove the cost of fuel cells down, making development of PEMFC systems more realistic. However, there is significant debate as to whether hydrogen fuel cells will be a realistic technology for use in automobiles or other vehicles. (See hydrogen economy.) A large part of PEMFC production is for the Toyota Mirai. The US Department of Energy estimates a 2016 price at $53/kW if 500,000 units per year were made.

<text>Conventional landing gear, or tailwheel-type landing gear, is an aircraft undercarriage consisting of two main wheels forward of the center of gravity and a small wheel or skid to support the tail. The term taildragger is also used.

The term &quot;conventional&quot; persists for historical reasons, but all modern jet aircraft and most modern propeller aircraft use tricycle gear.

==History==
In early aircraft, a tailskid made of metal or wood was used to support the tail on the ground. In most modern aircraft with conventional landing gear, a small articulated wheel assembly is attached to the rearmost part of the airframe in place of the skid. This wheel may be steered by the pilot through a connection to the rudder pedals, allowing the rudder and tailwheel to move together.

Before aircraft commonly used tailwheels, many aircraft (like a number of First World War Sopwith aircraft, such as the Camel fighter) were equipped with steerable tailskids, which operate similar to a tailwheel. When the pilot pressed the right rudder pedal—or the right footrest of a &quot;rudder bar&quot; in World War I—the skid pivoted to the right, creating more drag on that side of the plane and causing it to turn to the right. While less effective than a steerable wheel, it gave the pilot some control of the direction the craft was moving while taxiing or beginning the takeoff run, before there was enough airflow over the rudder for it to become effective.

Another form of control, which is less common now than it once was, is to steer using &quot;differential braking&quot;, in which the tailwheel is a simple, freely castering mechanism, and the aircraft is steered by applying brakes to one of the mainwheels in order to turn in that direction. This is also used on some tricycle gear aircraft, with the nosewheel being the freely castering wheel instead. Like the steerable tailwheel/skid, it is usually integrated with the rudder pedals on the craft to allow an easy transition between wheeled and aerodynamic control.

== Advantages ==
The tailwheel configuration offers several advantages over the tricycle landing gear arrangement, which make tailwheel aircraft less expensive to manufacture and maintain.
* Due to its position much further from the center of gravity, a tailwheel supports a smaller part of the aircraft&#x27;s weight allowing it to be made much smaller and lighter than a nosewheel. As a result, the smaller wheel weighs less and causes less parasitic drag.
* Because of the way airframe loads are distributed while operating on rough ground, tailwheel aircraft are better able to sustain this type of use over a long period of time, without cumulative airframe damage occurring.
* If a tailwheel fails on landing, the damage to the aircraft will be minimal. This is not the case in the event of a nosewheel failure, which usually results in a prop strike.
* Due to the increased propeller clearance on tailwheel aircraft, less stone chip damage will result from operating a conventionally geared aircraft on rough or gravel airstrips, making them well suited to bush flying.
* Tailwheel aircraft are more suitable for operation on skis.
* Tailwheel aircraft are easier to fit into and maneuver inside some hangars.

==Disadvantages==
The conventional landing gear arrangement has disadvantages compared to nosewheel aircraft.

*Tailwheel aircraft are more subject to &quot;nose-over&quot; accidents due to incorrect application of brakes by the pilot.
*Conventional geared aircraft are much more susceptible to ground looping. A ground loop occurs when directional control is lost on the ground and the tail of the aircraft passes the nose, swapping ends, in some cases completing a full circle. This event can result in damage to the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage, tires, wingtips, propeller and engine. Ground-looping occurs because whereas a nosewheel aircraft is steered from ahead of the center of gravity, a taildragger is steered from behind (much like driving a car backwards at high speed), so that on the ground a taildragger is inherently unstable, whereas a nosewheel aircraft will self-center if it swerves on landing. In addition, some tailwheel aircraft must transition from using the rudder to steer to using the tailwheel while passing through a speed range when neither is wholly effective due to the nose high angle of the aircraft and lack of airflow over the rudder. Avoiding ground loops requires more pilot training and skill.
*Tailwheel aircraft generally suffer from poorer forward visibility on the ground, compared to nose wheel aircraft. Often this requires continuous &quot;S&quot; turns on the ground to allow the pilot to see where they are taxiing.
*Tailwheel aircraft are more difficult to taxi during high wind conditions, due to the higher angle of attack on the wings which can then develop more lift on one side, making control difficult or impossible. They also suffer from lower crosswind capability and in some wind conditions may be unable to use crosswind runways or single-runway airports.
*Due to the nose-high attitude on the ground, propeller-powered taildraggers are more adversely affected by P-factor – asymmetrical thrust caused by the propeller&#x27;s disk being angled to the direction of travel, which causes the blades to produce more lift when going down than when going up due to the difference in angle the blade experiences when passing through the air. The aircraft will then pull to the side of the upward blade. Some aircraft lack sufficient rudder authority in some flight regimes (particularly at higher power settings on takeoff) and the pilot must compensate before the aircraft starts to yaw. Some aircraft, particularly older, higher powered aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang, cannot use full power on takeoff and still safely control their direction of travel. On landing this is less of a factor, however opening the throttle to abort a landing can induce severe uncontrollable yaw unless the pilot is prepared for it.

==Jet-powered tailwheel aircraft==
Jet aircraft generally cannot use conventional landing gear, as this orients the engines at a high angle, causing their jet blast to bounce off the ground and back into the air, preventing the elevators from functioning properly. This problem occurred with the third, or &quot;V3&quot; prototype of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter. After the first four prototype Me 262 V-series airframes were built with retracting tailwheel gear, the fifth prototype was fitted with fixed tricycle landing gear for trials, with the sixth prototype onwards getting fully retracting tricycle gear. A number of other experimental and prototype jet aircraft had conventional landing gear, including the first successful jet, the Heinkel He 178, the Ball-Bartoe Jetwing research aircraft, and a single Vickers VC.1 Viking, which was modified with Rolls-Royce Nene engines to become the world&#x27;s first jet airliner.
Rare examples of jet-powered tailwheel aircraft that went into production and saw service include the British Supermarine Attacker naval fighter and the Soviet Yakovlev Yak-15. Both first flew in 1946 and owed their configurations to being developments of earlier propeller powered aircraft. The Attacker&#x27;s tailwheel configuration was a result of it using the Supermarine Spiteful&#x27;s wing, avoiding expensive design modification or retooling. The engine exhaust was behind the elevator and tailwheel, reducing problems. The Yak-15 was based on the Yakovlev Yak-3 propeller fighter. Its engine was mounted under the forward fuselage. Despite its unusual configuration, the Yak-15 was easy to fly. Although a fighter, it was mainly used as a trainer aircraft to prepare Soviet pilots for flying more advanced jet fighters.

==Monowheel undercarriage==

A variation of the taildragger layout is the monowheel landing gear.

To minimize drag, many modern gliders have a single wheel, retractable or fixed, centered under the fuselage, which is referred to as &quot;monowheel gear&quot; or &quot;monowheel landing gear&quot;. Monowheel gear is also used on some powered aircraft, where drag reduction is a priority, such as the Europa XS. Monowheel power aircraft use retractable wingtip legs (with small castor wheels attached) to prevent the wingtips from striking the ground. A monowheel aircraft may have a tailwheel (like the Europa) or a nosewheel (like the Schleicher ASK 23 glider).

==Training==
Taildragger aircraft require more training time for student pilots to master. This was a large factor in the 1950s switch by most manufacturers to nosewheel-equipped trainers, and for many years nosewheel aircraft have been more popular than taildraggers. As a result, most Private Pilot Licence (PPL) pilots now learn to fly in tricycle gear aircraft (e.g. Cessna 172 or Piper Cherokee) and only later transition to taildraggers.

==Techniques==
Landing a conventional geared aircraft can be accomplished in two ways.

Normal landings are done by touching all three wheels down at the same time in a &quot;three-point landing&quot;. This method does allow the shortest landing distance but can be difficult to carry out in crosswinds, as rudder control may be reduced severely before the tailwheel can become effective.

The alternative is the &quot;wheel landing&quot;. This requires the pilot to land the aircraft on the mainwheels while maintaining the tailwheel in the air with elevator to keep the angle of attack low. Once the aircraft has slowed to a speed that can ensure control will not be lost, but above the speed at which rudder effectiveness is lost, then the tailwheel is lowered to the ground.

<doc id="1049602" wikidata="Q901910" url="?curid=1049602" title="Direct methanol fuel cell">
<text>Direct methanol fuel cells or DMFCs are a subcategory of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells in which methanol is used as the fuel and a special proton-conducting polymer as the membrane (PEM).
Their main advantage is low temperature operation and the ease of transport of methanol, an energy-dense yet reasonably stable liquid at all environmental conditions.

Whilst the thermodynamic theoretical energy conversion efficiency of a DMFC is 97%; as of 2014 the achievable energy conversion efficiency for operational cells attains 30% – 40%. There is intensive research on promising approaches to increase the operational efficiency.

A more efficient version of a direct fuel cell would play a key role in the theoretical use of methanol as a general energy transport medium, in the hypothesized methanol economy.

== The cell ==
In contrast to indirect methanol fuel cells, where methanol is reacted to hydrogen by steam reforming, DMFCs use a methanol solution (usually around 1M, i.e. about 3% in mass) to carry the reactant into the cell; common operating temperatures are in the range , where high temperatures are usually pressurized.
DMFCs themselves are more efficient at high temperatures and pressures, but these conditions end up causing so many losses in the complete system that the advantage is lost; therefore, atmospheric-pressure configurations are currently preferred.

Because of the methanol cross-over, a phenomenon by which methanol diffuses through the membrane without reacting, methanol is fed as a weak solution: this decreases efficiency significantly, since crossed-over methanol, after reaching the air side (the cathode), immediately reacts with air; though the exact kinetics are debated, the result is a reduction of the cell voltage. Cross-over remains a major factor in inefficiencies, and often half of the methanol is lost to cross-over. Methanol cross-over and/or its effects can be alleviated by (a) developing alternative membranes (e.g.), (b) improving the electro-oxidation process in the catalyst layer and improving the structure of the catalyst and gas diffusion layers (e.g. ), and (c) optimizing the design of the flow field and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) which can be achieved by studying the current density distributions (e.g. ).

Other issues include the management of carbon dioxide created at the anode, the sluggish dynamic behavior, and the ability to maintain the solution water.

The only waste products with these types of fuel cells are carbon dioxide and water.

== Application ==
Current DMFCs are limited in the power they can produce, but can still store a high energy content in a small space. This means they can produce a small amount of power over a long period of time. This makes them ill-suited for powering large vehicles (at least directly), but ideal for smaller vehicles such as forklifts and tuggers and consumer goods such as mobile phones, digital cameras or laptops. Military applications of DMFCs are an emerging application since they have low noise and thermal signatures and no toxic effluent. These applications include power for man-portable tactical equipment, battery chargers, and autonomous power for test and training instrumentation. Units are available with power outputs between 25 watts and 5 kilowatts with durations up to 100 hours between refuelings. Especially for power output up to 0.3 kW the DMFC is suitable. For a power output of more than 0.3 kW the indirect methanol fuel cell presents a higher efficiency and is more cost-efficient. Freezing of the liquid methanol-water mixture in the stack at low ambient temperature can be problematic for the membrane of DMFC (in contrast to indirect methanol fuel cell).

== Methanol ==
Methanol is a liquid from at atmospheric pressure.
The volumetric energy density of methanol is an order of magnitude greater than even highly compressed hydrogen, about two times greater than liquid hydrogen and 2.6 times higher than lithium-ion batteries. The energy density per mass is a tenth of that of hydrogen, but 10 times higher than that of lithium-ion batteries.

Methanol is slightly toxic and highly flammable. However, the International Civil Aviation Organization&#x27;s (ICAO) Dangerous Goods Panel (DGP) voted in November 2005 to allow passengers to carry and use micro fuel cells and methanol fuel cartridges when aboard airplanes to power laptop computers and other consumer electronic devices.
On September 24, 2007, the US Department of Transportation issued a proposal to allow airline passengers to carry fuel cell cartridges on board.
The Department of Transportation issued a final ruling on April 30, 2008, permitting passengers and crew to carry an approved fuel cell with an installed methanol cartridge and up to two additional spare cartridges.
It is worth noting that 200 ml maximum methanol cartridge volume allowed in the final ruling is double the 100 ml limit on liquids allowed by the Transportation Security Administration in carry-on bags.

== Reaction ==
The DMFC relies upon the oxidation of methanol on a catalyst layer to form carbon dioxide. Water is consumed at the anode and produced at the cathode. Protons (H+) are transported across the proton exchange membrane - often made from Nafion - to the cathode where they react with oxygen to produce water. Electrons are transported through an external circuit from anode to cathode, providing power to connected devices.

The half-reactions are:

Methanol and water are adsorbed on a catalyst usually made of platinum and ruthenium particles, and lose protons until carbon dioxide is formed. As water is consumed at the anode in the reaction, pure methanol cannot be used without provision of water via either passive transport such as back diffusion (osmosis), or active transport such as pumping. The need for water limits the energy density of the fuel.

Platinum is used as a catalyst for both half-reactions. This contributes to the loss of cell voltage potential, as any methanol that is present in the cathode chamber will oxidize. If another catalyst could be found for the reduction of oxygen, the problem of methanol crossover would likely be significantly lessened. Furthermore, platinum is very expensive and contributes to the high cost per kilowatt of these cells.

During the methanol oxidation reaction carbon monoxide (CO) is formed, which strongly adsorbs onto the platinum catalyst, reducing the number of available reaction sites and thus the performance of the cell. The addition of other metals, such as ruthenium or gold, to the platinum catalyst tends to ameliorate this problem. In the case of platinum-ruthenium catalysts, the oxophilic nature of ruthenium is believed to promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals on its surface, which can then react with carbon monoxide adsorbed on the platinum atoms. The water in the fuel cell is oxidized to a hydroxy radical via the following reaction: H2O → OH• + H+ + e−. The hydroxy radical then oxidizes carbon monoxide to produce carbon dioxide, which is released from the surface as a gas: CO + OH• → CO2 + H+ + e−.

Using these OH groups in the half reactions, they are also expressed as:

=== Cross-over current ===
Methanol on the anodic side is usually in a weak solution (from 1M to 3M), because methanol in high concentrations has the tendency to diffuse through the membrane to the cathode, where its concentration is about zero because it is rapidly consumed by oxygen. Low concentrations help in reducing the cross-over, but also limit the maximum attainable current.

The practical realization is usually that a solution loop enters the anode, exits, is refilled with methanol, and returns to the anode again. Alternatively, fuel cells with optimized structures can be directly fed with high concentration methanol solutions or even pure methanol.

=== Water drag ===
The water in the anodic loop is lost because of the anodic reaction, but mostly because of the associated water drag: every proton formed at the anode drags a number of water molecules to the cathode. Depending on temperature and membrane type, this number can be between 2 and 6.

== Ancillary units ==
A direct methanol fuel cell is usually part of a larger system including all the ancillary units that permit its operation. Compared to most other types of fuel cells, the ancillary system of DMFCs is relatively complex. The main reasons for its complexity are:

* providing water along with methanol would make the fuel supply more cumbersome, so water has to be recycled in a loop;
* CO2 has to be removed from the solution flow exiting the fuel cell;
* water in the anodic loop is slowly consumed by reaction and drag; it is necessary to recover water from the cathodic side to maintain steady operation.

<doc id="1049610" wikidata="Q1961349" url="?curid=1049610" title="Cerebro">
<text>Cerebro (; Spanish for &quot;brain&quot;, from Latin ) is a fictional device appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The device is used by the X-Men (in particular, their leader, Professor Charles Xavier) to detect humans, specifically mutants. It was created by Professor X and Magneto, and was later enhanced by Dr. Hank McCoy.

==Concept and creation==

Cerebro first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #7 (September 1964). Professor Jeffrey J. Kripal, in his 2011 book &quot;Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal&quot;, calls Cerebro &quot;a piece of psychotronics&quot; and describes it as &quot;a spiderlike, Kirby-esque system of machines and wires that transmitted extrasensory data into Professor Xavier&#x27;s private desk in another room&quot;. Kripal notes that Cerebro made multiple subsequent central appearances, including &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (1975), where Cerebro senses and locates a supermutant across the globe, resulting in the recreation of the X-Men team.

==Use and function of the device==
Cerebro amplifies the brainwaves of the user. In the case of telepaths, it enables the user to detect traces of others worldwide, also able to distinguish between humans and mutants. Depictions of its inherent strength have been inconsistent; at times in the storylines it could detect mutated aliens outside of the planet, when at others it could only scan for mutants&#x27; signatures in the United States. It is not clear whether it finds mutants by the power signature they send out when they use their powers or by the presence of the X-gene in their body; both methods have been used throughout the comics.

Using Cerebro can be extremely dangerous, and telepaths without well-trained, disciplined minds put themselves at great risk when attempting to use it. This is due to the psychic feedback that users experience when operating Cerebro. As the device greatly enhances natural psychic ability, users who are unprepared for the sheer enormity of this increased psychic input can be quickly and easily overwhelmed, resulting in insanity, coma, permanent brain damage or even death. The one exception has been Magneto, who has been said to have minor or latent telepathic abilities as well as experience amplifying his mental powers with mechanical devices of his own design.

The only characters to use Cerebro on a frequent basis are Professor X, Jean Grey, Emma Frost and the Stepford Cuckoos. However, Cable, Rachel Summers, Kitty Pryde, Danielle Moonstar, Psylocke and Ruth Aldine have also used it. After the device was upgraded to Cerebra, Cassandra Nova used it in order to exchange minds with Xavier. The Stepford Cuckoos once utilized the machine to amplify their combined ability, with only one of them directly connected to the machine, but all of them experiencing its interaction due to their psychic rapport.

Some mutants have learned to shield themselves from Cerebro, usually via their own telepathic ability. Magneto can shield himself from the device through use of minimal telepathic powers; in the film series, he does so with a specially constructed helmet.

It would soon become apparent as to just what and how Cerebro was really meant to be used; on top of tracking and locating mutants across the globe the tracking device&#x27;s primary function was to act as a soul jar that could catalog the thought pattern self of any and every mutant ever pinpointed through it. X essentially utilized this function to resurrect the mutant strike team lost while battling Orchis by withholding their hard copied mind&#x27;s, their anima, onto home grown clone bodies; which would effectively allow him to resurrect any and every mutant who has ever died or will die by imprinting a shell with their respective neuropsychic imprint.

==History of the device==
Originally, Cerebro was a device similar to a computer that was built into a desk in Xavier&#x27;s office. This early version of Cerebro operated on punched cards, and did not require a user (telepathic or otherwise) to interface with it. A prototype version of Cerebro named Cyberno was used by Xavier to track down Cyclops in the &quot;Origins of the X-Men&quot; back-up story in &quot;X-Men&quot; #40. In the first published appearance of Cerebro, &quot;X-Men&quot; #7, Professor X left the X-Men on a secret mission (to find Lucifer) and left Cerebro to the new team leader, Cyclops, who used it to keep track of known evil mutants and to find new evil mutants. The device also warned the X-Men of the impending threat posed by the non-mutant Juggernaut prior to that character&#x27;s first appearance. Later, the device was upgraded to the larger and more familiar telepathy-based technology with its interface helmet.

When the human-Sentinel gestalt Bastion stole Cerebro from the X-Mansion, Cerebro was hybridized with Bastion&#x27;s programming via nanotechnology. The resulting entity, a self-aware form of Cerebro, created two minions, Cerebrites Alpha and Beta, through which it would act without exposing itself. It also used its Danger Room-derived records of the powers of the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to create its own team of imposter &quot;X-Men&quot; whose members possessed the combined powers of specific members of each of the two teams. Cerebro&#x27;s goal was to put human beings in stasis so that mutants could inherit the Earth, and to this end it hunted down a group of synthetic children called the Mannites who possessed vast psychic powers. It was destroyed by the X-Men, with the help of Professor X and the Mannite named Nina.

More recently, following the example set by the &quot;X-Men&quot; films, Cerebro has been replaced by Cerebra (referred to as Cerebro&#x27;s big sister), a machine the size of a small room in the basement of Xavier&#x27;s School For Higher Learning. Though designed to resemble the movie version of Cerebro, Cerebra is much smaller than the films&#x27; version. It resembles a pod filled with a sparkling fog that condenses into representations of mental images.

After it is discovered that Terrigen is toxic to mutants and Storm&#x27;s X-Men move to Limbo, Forge programs Cerebra into the body of a Sentinel and uploads her with the capability to showcase human emotion. Cerebra accompanies the X-Men on many of their missions to help find mutants and bring them to X-Haven where they&#x27;ll be safe from the Terrigen. Along with being able to detect mutants Cerebra can also fly and teleport, serving as a bridge between Earth and Limbo.

When the X-Men and Inhumans went to war to decide the fate of the remaining Terrigen cloud, Cerebra was destroyed after getting caught in the crossfire when Emma Frost unleashed an army of Sentinels programmed to kill Inhumans instead of mutants. While Storm&#x27;s team of X-Men began returning refugees to their homes from X-Haven after Medusa destroyed the Terrigen cloud, Cerebra was found severely damaged in an abandoned barn surrounded by wild Sentinels. Once she was discovered and the X-Men saw that her current sentinel body was far beyond repair they uploaded her into a new body.

Later when a mutant nation was created on the Living Island Krakoa, Xavier reveals that when he approached Forge and asked him to expand the abilities of Cerebro, Forge was able to create a version of Cerebro that not only was capable of merely detecting mutant minds but also creating a copy of each mutants&#x27; mind. Forge was able to create this seventh version of the Cerebro as a portable unit able to be worn as a helmet by Xavier to focus his psionic talent at all times. Xavier first donned this Cerebro when he announced the existence of Krakoa to the world and invited all mutants to Krakoa. He then utilized its true functioning of stirring and transplanting persona &amp; psyche while in conjunction with the technomorphically modified genus loci of Krakoa and the unified teamwork of the Five; a mutant conclave consisting of Joshua Foley, Hope Summers, Eva Bell, Kevin MacTaggert and Fabio Medina who gestate and accelerate the regrowth of fallen mutants by combining their powers. Xavier also had five working Cerebro Cradles: one main unit, three backup units, and one additional backup unit for unforeseen complications. These Cerebro Cradles are strategically located at multiple locations.

Not soon after, XENO mercenaries were able to infiltrate Krakoa&#x27;s defenses and successfully assassinate Professor X, destroying Cerebro in the process. Before Professor X was resurrected, Magneto reshaped the broken shards of Cerebro into the Cerebro Sword to represent Xavier&#x27;s dream, once broken, but now forged anew and refined. The sword retained the information stored in the other Cerebro Cradles, however, it is encrypted.

Later one of the backup Cerebro unit become sentient and rebranded itself under the name Cerebrax. Hunger for intelligence and power, the sentient machine begins killing mutants across the island and eventually takes control of Krakoa and begins unleashing a full-on attack. Answering the call to fight are Kid Omega, Omega Red, Wolverine, Domino and Phoebe Cuckoo. Kid Omega flies into Cerebrax and, with some help from Sage, unleashes a powerful explosion that ultimately destroys the Cerebro unit and himself. Given that Krakoa has the power to resurrect dead mutants, Wolverine tells Sage that they&#x27;re going to have to do so for Kid Omega, however Sage reveals a problem, there&#x27;s no trace of Kid Omega anywhere. He&#x27;s wiped from all the Cerebro cradles.

==Other versions==
In Chris Claremont&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; storyline, which takes place some 20 years ahead of standard X-Men continuity, Cerebro has been replaced in turn by the disembodied brain of Martha Johansson, a human psychic who was introduced during Grant Morrison&#x27;s run on the X-Men.

In the video game &quot;X-Men Legends&quot;, Cerebro is identical to its appearance and usage in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film. Jean Grey and Emma Frost use the device at one point to attempt to return Professor X&#x27;s mind to his body. In &quot;X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse&quot;, it was destroyed along with the rest of the mansion, but Forge mentioned plans on building Cerebra to replace it. He described Cerebra as Cerebro&#x27;s big sister.

In the video game &quot;&quot;, while the team is staying in the Sanctum Sanctorum, Professor X used a device created by Beast allowing him to use Cerebro from long distance in order to find Nightcrawler, who had been kidnapped by Dr. Doom.

In the universe of &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;, zombified versions of Beast and Mr. Fantastic reprogram Cerebro to help them and the other zombies track down the last remaining humans on Earth. Cerebro locates many in the European nation of Latveria, but all escape. In &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;, the surviving zombies escape to another world where many of them restart the original infection, this time permanently fusing Professor X&#x27;s partly zombiefied body with Cerebro so that he can find humans for them.

In the MC2 universe, the X-People carry &quot;mini-cerebros&quot;, that can detect mutants just as well as the full-size version.

==In other media==

===Films===

====&quot;Generation X&quot;====
In the 1996 &quot;Generation X&quot; telefilm on Fox, Cerebro was depicted as a desktop personal computer with a few custom peripherals.

====&quot;X-Men&quot;====

Professor Jeffrey J. Kripal, in his 2011 book &quot;Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal&quot;, describes the Cerebro of the &quot;X-Men&quot; films as &quot;a futuristic superroom into which Professor Xavier wheels over a bridge in order to don the helmet that would magnify his already extraordinary telepathic powers and project the results onto the skull-like internal walls of the room.&quot; In the films &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot;, Cerebro is a device that fills a massive spherical room in the basement of Xavier&#x27;s School. The helmet interface is similar to the version seen in the comics, although the bulk of Cerebro&#x27;s machinery is contained in the surrounding walls. While in use, three-dimensional images of the humans whose minds are being scanned by the device appear around the interface bridge. Unlike the comics&#x27; version of Cerebro, the film version can detect both human and mutant minds with ease. The unique signature of mutant brainwaves is shown in the first film by the mental images of humans depicted in black and white, while those of mutants show up in red. When Xavier illustrates his connection with every human and mutant mind on Earth in the sequel, &quot;X2&quot;, mutants appear in red, and humans in white.

In the first film, Professor X mentions to Wolverine that Magneto helped him build it, and therefore knows how to construct helmets with circuitry to block its detection abilities. Cerebro is sabotaged by Mystique so that it injures Professor X, putting him into a coma. The only person seen using Cerebro effectively in the films is Xavier; Jean Grey successfully used the device to locate Magneto in the original film, but the input overwhelmed her nascent telepathic power and left her stunned. This has not been mentioned in the comics, although the Magneto of the comics can use Cerebro, and has designed similar devices.

====&quot;X2: X-Men United&quot;====
In &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot;, the device was copied and modified by William Stryker in his plot to have a brainwashed Xavier use his Cerebro-amplified powers to kill the world&#x27;s mutants, although this plan was later &#x27;hi-jacked&#x27; by Magneto—immune to the telepathic assault via his helmet—so that Xavier would be used to kill humans. According to &quot;X2&quot;, it is difficult to pinpoint the location of mutants who have the ability to teleport and are constantly in transit, such as Nightcrawler.

In both films, Magneto&#x27;s helmet is capable of blocking the telepathic signals from Cerebro, as well as any telepathic mutants.

====&quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;====
In &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, an early version of Cerebro exists in an unnamed CIA science facility, built by the young Hank McCoy to amplify brainwaves. In a slight departure from the source material, its creation and design is attributed to Hank, instead of Charles Xavier. It is used by Xavier to find and recruit mutants for training in order to oppose Sebastian Shaw. It is later destroyed by Riptide as Shaw searches the facility for the young mutants.

In the film, Emma Frost comments on her perception of Xavier&#x27;s increased telepathic range when using Cerebro, which she feels despite being some thousands of miles away.

====&quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;====
In &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, Cerebro appears in the future X-Jet as a built in extension to Xavier&#x27;s hover-chair and is made up of three sensor-pads and a 3D holographic projector. In the past, it appears as it did in &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;X2&quot;, albeit dusty from long years of neglect due to the past Xavier&#x27;s current inability to use his powers. As his abilities begin to return, the young Xavier initially attempts to use it to find Mystique after she escapes from their first confrontation, but has trouble concentrating enough to use it properly due to his current emotional turmoil. However, a conversation with his future self—using the time-displaced Wolverine as a &#x27;bridge&#x27; to make contact with his other self in the future, who is close to Wolverine&#x27;s currently-comatose body—helps him regain his old focus, allowing him to temporarily control others to speak to Raven before sending a psychic projection directly to her.

In the &quot;Rogue Cut&quot; version of the film, Cerebro is being used in the future as a prison for Rogue, who is being experimented on by the Sentinels&#x27; human agents in the hope of finding a way to duplicate her ability to take powers from others, with Cerebro being used as the room&#x27;s interior is shielded from external telepathic probes. Also, in 1973, Mystique returns to the mansion to get treatment for her wound as a cover for her real agenda to smash Cerebro, preventing Xavier from finding her again.

====&quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;====
Cerebro appears in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; where Xavier uses Cerebro and sees Moira searching for Erik. Xavier tells Alex to destroy Cerebro after Apocalypse is able to use Xavier&#x27;s search for him to take control of Xavier&#x27;s powers through Cerebro, although Apocalypse still manages to use Xavier to make humanity sacrifice most of its nuclear weapons before Cerebro is lost.

====&quot;Logan&quot;====
In this alternate timeline of &quot;Logan&quot;, Cerebro has become a covering at Logan and Charles Xavier&#x27;s home at an abandoned smelting mill in Mexico.

====&quot;Deadpool 2&quot;====
Cerebro appears when &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; when a depressed Wade Wilson/Deadpool is trying to use the Cerebro at the X-Mansion to “look into the future.” 

====&quot;Dark Phoenix&quot;====
Cerebro appears in &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; when Xavier uses it to navigate Jean&#x27;s mind and later to locate Jean, Magneto and Hank.

===Television===

====&quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;====
In &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; Cerebro was heavily featured throughout the series&#x27; duration. It was primarily used by Professor Xavier and he was shown to use it in various ways, such as detecting mutants, increasing his powers, and even understanding Shi&#x27;ar technology, and so forth. There was no specified room where Cerebro was kept as in the other animated series but instead came out from the ceiling in most notably the War Room where the X-Men held their team meetings. Jean Grey was also noted to use Cerebro frequently and it would amplify her telepathic powers as it did for Professor X. Jean Grey in this animated series did not always join the X-Men on their field missions but rather monitored them telepathically using Cerebro&#x27;s help. Even the White Queen of the Hellfire Club, Emma Frost, used Cerebro when she telepathically hacked into it to secretly &quot;spy&quot; on Xavier, the X-Men, and to learn more about Jean Grey and her transformation into the Phoenix. The X-Men&#x27;s Blackbird jet was also equipped with its own Cerebro.

====&quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;====
In the animated series &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;, Cerebro was featured numerous times. It was shown being used mainly by the Professor and eventually Jean Grey. In the beginning of the series Cerebro was a primitive version of what it would later become as the show progressed eventually taking an appearance identical to the Cerebro in the X-Men films. Cerebro originally appeared as a computer console with custom peripherals that came out of a hidden wall component in the mansion. Eventually, this Cerebro was destroyed by Professor X&#x27;s evil step-brother the Juggernaut. When it was rebuilt the Cerebro was given its own room, instead of the hidden wall component as before, and looked identical to the designs of Cerebro in the films. Cerebro even came in a portable helmet form for travel and field missions. Jean Grey used this Cerebro to amplify her telepathic powers as she did in the comics and previous series. It even helped boost Jean&#x27;s telepathic powers in order to battle a possessed Professor X in the series finale. During the fight, Cerebro was shown to unleash the Phoenix within Jean for a split second, eventually gaining the power to defeat the evil Xavier, and return him to normal. In the episode &quot;Fun and Games&quot;, Arcade, a student version of one of the X-Men greatest villains, hacked into Cerebro and used it to control the mansion&#x27;s security system to attack the X-Men believing the program to be a game. However, he made no use of its telepathy-enhancement technology, instead merely rewiring it to allow him access to the security systems.

====&quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;====
In the 2008 series, &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;, Cerebro is extremely important to the overall series as it serves as a link to the past, present, and future. Originally Cerebro was damaged in an unexplained attack on Professor X in the present where he ends up in a coma only to awake twenty years into the future. In the future twenty years from now the X-Men have all been killed and the world is being controlled by the mutant-hunting robots named Sentinels. Xavier, with the surviving Cerebro components he finds, telepathically contacts the X-Men twenty years in the past (the present) and instructs them to stop those who would create the bleak future he awakes in twenty years later (his present). During the majority of the X-Men&#x27;s present, as well as its first appearances in the future, it is similar to the version seen in the X-Men films, however, for the majority of the scenes in the future, Xavier uses a Portable version of Cerebro. With Warren Worthington&#x27;s money and Forge&#x27;s technical expertise, the X-Men were able to get the destroyed Cerebro at the mansion repaired. As Xavier is comatose in the present and Jean Grey missing, Emma Frost serves as the team&#x27;s resident telepath and she primarily uses Cerebro.

====&quot;Black Panther&quot;====
In the 2010 series &quot;Black Panther&quot;, Storm uses Cerebro to locate Juggernaut in Wakanda.

====&quot;Legion&quot;====
An early version of Cerebro is seen in &quot;Legion&quot; used by Professor X in the third-season episode &quot;Chapter 22.&quot;

====&quot;M.O.D.O.K.&quot;====
The Cerebro helmet appears in the second episode of &quot;M.O.D.O.K.&quot;, where it was found by M.O.D.O.K. in a S.H.I.E.L.D. storage facility.

====&quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;====
In &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot; Cerebro was heavily featured throughout the series&#x27; duration. It was used by Jean Grey to probe Henry Peter Gyrich&#x27;s mind to find out about the whereabouts of Bolivar Trask. She also sees a horrifying vision of Master Mold destroying Genosha in the episode &quot;To Me, My X-Men&quot;. In the episode &quot;Tolerance is Extinction - Part 1&quot;, Beast recalibrated Cerebro to scan for cyborg brain frequencies, to find out how many people have been turned into Prime Sentinels by Bastion.

<doc id="1049624" wikidata="Q900987" url="?curid=1049624" title="Phosphoric acid fuel cell">
<text>Phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) are a type of fuel cell that uses liquid phosphoric acid as an electrolyte. They were the first fuel cells to be commercialized. Developed in the mid-1960s and field-tested since the 1970s, they have improved significantly in stability, performance, and cost. Such characteristics have made the PAFC a good candidate for early stationary applications.

==Design==
Electrolyte is highly concentrated or pure liquid phosphoric acid (H3PO4) saturated in a silicon carbide (SiC) matrix. Operating range is about 150 to 210 °C. The electrodes are made of carbon paper coated with a finely dispersed platinum catalyst.

==Electrode reactions==

Anode reaction: 2H2(g) → 4H+ + 4e
Cathode reaction: O2(g) + 4H+ + 4e‾ → 2H2O

Overall cell reaction: 2 H2 + O2 → 2H2O

==Advantages and disadvantages==
At an operating range of 150 to 200 °C, the expelled water can be converted to steam for air and water heating (combined heat and power). This potentially allows efficiency increases of up to 70%. PAFCs are CO2-tolerant and can tolerate a CO concentration of about 1.5%, which broadens the choice of fuels they can use. If gasoline is used, the sulfur must be removed. At lower temperatures phosphoric acid is a poor ionic conductor, and CO poisoning of the platinum electro-catalyst in the anode becomes severe. However, they are much less sensitive to CO than proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and alkaline fuel cells (AFC).

Disadvantages include rather low power density and chemically aggressive electrolyte.

==Applications==

PAFC have been used for stationary power generators with output in the 100 kW to 400 kW range and are also finding application in large vehicles such as buses.

Major manufacturers of PAFC technology include Doosan Fuel Cell America Inc. (formerly ClearEdge Power &amp; UTC Power) and Fuji Electric.

India&#x27;s DRDO has developed PAFC based air-independent propulsion for integration into their s.

<text>The International Exchange, now ICE Futures (since 2005-04-7), based in London, was one of the world&#x27;s largest energy futures and options exchanges. Its flagship commodity, &quot;Brent Crude&quot; was a world benchmark for oil prices, but the exchange also handled futures contracts and options on fuel oil, natural gas, electricity (baseload and peakload), coal contracts and, as of 22 April 2005, carbon emission allowances with the European Climate Exchange (ECX).

The IPE was acquired by the Intercontinental Exchange in 2001. The IPE was an open outcry exchange until 7 April 2005, when its name was changed to ICE Futures and all trading was shifted onto an electronic trading platform.

==History==

Until the 1970s, the price of oil was relatively stable with production largely controlled by the biggest oil companies. During that decade two oil price shocks led to continued price volatility in the market; short-term physical markets evolved, and the need to hedge emerged.

A group of energy and futures companies founded the IPE in 1980, and the first contract, for gas oil futures, was launched the following year. In June 1988, the IPE launched Brent Crude futures.

Since its inception, oil futures and latterly options have been traded in pits on the trading floor using the open outcry system. As business volumes have grown, the IPE has moved location several times to accommodate new pits and more traders.

The Exchange has experienced incremental growth, year-on-year for most of its history. Complexity, but also efficiency have increased as new trading instruments such as swaps, futures, and options have been developed.

==Contracts==
Since 1997, the ICE Futures has expanded its offerings from Brent Crude and Gas Oil to include Natural Gas (1997), Electricity (2004), and ECX carbon financial instruments (2005). These expansions have allowed ICE Futures to offer a wider range of energy products. More advanced transactions are also now possible, due to cross- and multi-product transactions, which eliminate the need to use multiple markets or an adviser.

<text>Damian Kratzenberg (November 5, 1878 – October 11, 1946) was a highschool teacher who became head of the Volksdeutsche Bewegung (German-People&#x27;s Movement), a pro-Nazi political group, in Luxembourg during World War II. He was executed after the war for collaboration with the Nazis.

==Life and career==
Kratzenberg was the son of the administrator of the castle of Clervaux, a German immigrant. After receiving his baccalaureate at the Diekirch gymnasium, from 1898 to 1902 he studied literature in Luxembourg, Lille, Paris and Berlin. Following this, he taught Greek and German in Diekirch, Echternach, and from 1927 at the Athénée de Luxembourg.

From 1927 to 1936, Kratzenberg was a member of the liberal party. From the mid-1930s, he became a supporter of Nazi Germany. From 1935 to 1940, he was the president of GEDELIT, the &quot;Luxemburger Gesellschaft für deutsche Literatur und Kunst&quot; (Society for German Literature and Art). In 1936, he received the Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft.

Kratzenberg became head of the regional branch of the Volksdeutsche Bewegung in 1940, and was appointed head of the Athénée de Luxembourg in 1941.

Kratzenberg fled to Weißenburg in Bayern a few days before the liberation of Luxembourg on 1 September 1944. A letter to his daughter after the end of the war however gave his location away and Kratzenberg was apprehended by American military police, moved to Luxembourg and stood trial. He was sentenced to death on August 1, with the sentence carried out on October 11, 1946, at the shooting range of the barracks of the Holy Ghost Plateau in Luxembourg City.

<doc id="1049636" wikidata="Q899633" url="?curid=1049636" title="Solid oxide fuel cell">
<text>A solid oxide fuel cell (or SOFC) is an electrochemical conversion device that produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel. Fuel cells are characterized by their electrolyte material; the SOFC has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte.

Advantages of this class of fuel cells include high combined heat and power efficiency, long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions, and relatively low cost. The largest disadvantage is the high operating temperature which results in longer start-up times and mechanical and chemical compatibility issues.

==Introduction==
Solid oxide fuel cells are a class of fuel cells characterized by the use of a solid oxide material as the electrolyte. SOFCs use a solid oxide electrolyte to conduct negative oxygen ions from the cathode to the anode. The electrochemical oxidation of the hydrogen, carbon monoxide or other organic intermediates by oxygen ions thus occurs on the anode side. More recently, proton-conducting SOFCs (PC-SOFC) are being developed which transport protons instead of oxygen ions through the electrolyte with the advantage of being able to be run at lower temperatures than traditional SOFCs.

They operate at very high temperatures, typically between 600 and 1,000 °C. At these temperatures, SOFCs do not require expensive platinum group metals catalyst, as is currently necessary for lower temperature fuel cells such as PEMFCs, and are not vulnerable to carbon monoxide catalyst poisoning. However, vulnerability to sulfur poisoning has been widely observed and the sulfur must be removed before entering the cell. For fuels that are of lower quality, such as gasified biomass, coal, or biogas, the fuel processing becomes increasingly complex and, consequently, more expensive. The gasification process, which transforms the raw material into a gaseous state suitable for fuel cells, can generate significant quantities of compounds like methane and toluene, as well as larger polyaromatic and short-chain hydrocarbon compounds. These substances can lead to carbon buildup in SOFCs. The expenses associated with reforming and desulfurization are comparable in magnitude to the cost of the fuel cell itself. These factors become especially critical for systems with lower power output or greater portability requirements.

Solid oxide fuel cells have a wide variety of applications, from use as auxiliary power units in vehicles to stationary power generation with outputs from 100 W to 2 MW. In 2009, Australian company, Ceramic Fuel Cells successfully achieved an efficiency of an SOFC device up to the previously theoretical mark of 60%. The higher operating temperature make SOFCs suitable candidates for application with heat engine energy recovery devices or combined heat and power, which further increases overall fuel efficiency.

Because of these high temperatures, light hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane, propane, and butane can be internally reformed within the anode. SOFCs can also be fueled by externally reforming heavier hydrocarbons, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel (JP-8) or biofuels. Such reformates are mixtures of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam and methane, formed by reacting the hydrocarbon fuels with air or steam in a device upstream of the SOFC anode. SOFC power systems can increase efficiency by using the heat given off by the exothermic electrochemical oxidation within the fuel cell for endothermic steam reforming process. Additionally, solid fuels such as coal and biomass may be gasified to form syngas which is suitable for fueling SOFCs in integrated gasification fuel cell power cycles.

Thermal expansion demands a uniform and well-regulated heating process at startup. SOFC stacks with planar geometry require on the order of an hour to be heated to operating temperature. Micro-tubular fuel cell design geometries promise much faster start up times, typically in the order of minutes.

Unlike most other types of fuel cells, SOFCs can have multiple geometries. The planar fuel cell design geometry is the typical sandwich type geometry employed by most types of fuel cells, where the electrolyte is sandwiched in between the electrodes. SOFCs can also be made in tubular geometries where either air or fuel is passed through the inside of the tube and the other gas is passed along the outside of the tube. The tubular design is advantageous because it is much easier to seal air from the fuel. The performance of the planar design is currently better than the performance of the tubular design, however, because the planar design has a lower resistance comparatively. Other geometries of SOFCs include modified planar fuel cell designs (MPC or MPSOFC), where a wave-like structure replaces the traditional flat configuration of the planar cell. Such designs are highly promising because they share the advantages of both planar cells (low resistance) and tubular cells.

==Operation==

A solid oxide fuel cell is made up of four layers, three of which are ceramics (hence the name). A single cell consisting of these four layers stacked together is typically only a few millimeters thick. Hundreds of these cells are then connected in series to form what most people refer to as an &quot;SOFC stack&quot;. The ceramics used in SOFCs do not become electrically and ionically active until they reach very high temperature and as a consequence, the stacks have to run at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1,000 °C. Reduction of oxygen into oxygen ions occurs at the cathode. These ions can then diffuse through the solid oxide electrolyte to the anode where they can electrochemically oxidize the fuel. In this reaction, a water byproduct is given off as well as two electrons. These electrons then flow through an external circuit where they can do work. The cycle then repeats as those electrons enter the cathode material again.

===Balance of plant===
Most of the downtime of a SOFC stems from the mechanical balance of plant, the air preheater, prereformer, afterburner, water heat exchanger, anode tail gas oxidizer, and electrical balance of plant, power electronics, hydrogen sulfide sensor and fans. Internal reforming leads to a large decrease in the balance of plant costs in designing a full system.

===Anode===
The ceramic anode layer must be very porous to allow the fuel to flow towards the electrolyte. Consequently, granular matter is often selected for anode fabrication procedures. Like the cathode, it must conduct electrons, with ionic conductivity a definite asset. The anode is commonly the thickest and strongest layer in each individual cell, because it has the smallest polarization losses, and is often the layer that provides the mechanical support. Electrochemically speaking, the anode&#x27;s job is to use the oxygen ions that diffuse through the electrolyte to oxidize the hydrogen fuel.
The oxidation reaction between the oxygen ions and the hydrogen produces heat as well as water and electricity.
If the fuel is a light hydrocarbon, for example, methane, another function of the anode is to act as a catalyst for steam reforming the fuel into hydrogen. This provides another operational benefit to the fuel cell stack because the reforming reaction is endothermic, which cools the stack internally. The most common material used is a cermet made up of nickel mixed with the ceramic material that is used for the electrolyte in that particular cell, typically YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia). One version of constructing the anode is to use tape casting, after the slurry is prepared with resonant acoustic mixing. This low-impact mixing allows for the effective combination of NiO-YSZ slurries in about 30 minutes, more than 140 times faster than conventional ball milling (72 hours). The nanomaterial-based catalysts help stop the grain growth of nickel. Larger grains of nickel would reduce the contact area that ions can be conducted through, which would lower the cell&#x27;s efficiency. Perovskite materials (mixed ionic/electronic conducting ceramics) have been shown to produce a power density of 0.6 W/cm2 at 0.7 V at 800 °C which is possible because they have the ability to overcome a larger activation energy.

Chemical Reaction:

H2 +O2- ——&gt; H2O+2e

However, there are a few disadvantages associated with YSZ as anode material. Ni coarsening, carbon deposition, reduction-oxidation instability, and sulfur poisoning are the main obstacles limiting the long-term stability of Ni-YSZ. Ni coarsening refers to the evolution of Ni particles in doped in YSZ grows larger in grain size, which decreases the surface area for the catalytic reaction. Carbon deposition occurs when carbon atoms, formed by hydrocarbon pyrolysis or CO disproportionation, deposit on the Ni catalytic surface. Carbon deposition becomes important especially when hydrocarbon fuels are used, i.e. methane, syngas. The high operating temperature of SOFC and the oxidizing environment facilitate the oxidation of Ni catalyst through reaction Ni + O2 = NiO. The oxidation reaction of Ni reduces the electrocatalytic activity and conductivity. Moreover, the density difference between Ni and NiO causes volume change on the anode surface, which could potentially lead to mechanical failure. Sulfur poisoning arises when fuel such as natural gas, gasoline, or diesel is used. Again, due to the high affinity between sulfur compounds (H2S, (CH3)2S) and the metal catalyst, even the smallest impurities of sulfur compounds in the feed stream could deactivate the Ni catalyst on the YSZ surface.

Current research is focused on reducing or replacing Ni content in the anode to improve long-term performance. The modified Ni-YSZ containing other materials including CeO2, Y2O3, La2O3, MgO, TiO2, Ru, Co, etc. are invented to resist sulfur poisoning, but the improvement is limited due to the rapid initial degradation. Copper-based cerement anode is considered as a solution to carbon deposition because it is inert to carbon and stable under typical SOFC oxygen partial pressures (pO2). Cu-Co bimetallic anodes in particular show a great resistivity of carbon deposition after the exposure to pure CH4 at 800C. And Cu-CeO2-YSZ exhibits a higher electrochemical oxidation rate over Ni-YSZ when running on CO and syngas, and can achieve even higher performance using CO than H2, after adding a cobalt co-catalyst. Oxide anodes including zirconia-based fluorite and perovskites are also used to replace Ni-ceramic anodes for carbon resistance. Chromite i.e. La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM) is used as anodes and exhibited comparable performance against Ni–YSZ cermet anodes. LSCM is further improved by impregnating Cu and sputtering Pt as the current collector.

===Electrolyte===
The electrolyte is a dense layer of ceramic that conducts oxygen ions. Its electronic conductivity must be kept as low as possible to prevent losses from leakage currents. The high operating temperatures of SOFCs allow the kinetics of oxygen ion transport to be sufficient for good performance. However, as the operating temperature approaches the lower limit for SOFCs at around the electrolyte begins to have large ionic transport resistances and affect the performance. Popular electrolyte materials include yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) (often the 8% form 8YSZ), scandia stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) (usually 9 mol% Sc2O3 – 9ScSZ) and gadolinium doped ceria (GDC). The electrolyte material has crucial influence on the cell performances. Detrimental reactions between YSZ electrolytes and modern cathodes such as lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) have been found, and can be prevented by thin (&lt;100 nm) ceria diffusion barriers.

If the conductivity for oxygen ions in SOFC can remain high even at lower temperatures (current target in research ~500 °C), material choices for SOFC will broaden and many existing problems can potentially be solved. Certain processing techniques such as thin film deposition can help solve this problem with existing materials by:

* reducing the traveling distance of oxygen ions and electrolyte resistance as resistance is proportional to conductor length;
* producing grain structures that are less resistive such as columnar grain structure;
* controlling the microstructural nano-crystalline fine grains to achieve &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of electrical properties;
* building composite possessing large interfacial areas as interfaces have been shown to have extraordinary electrical properties.

===Cathode===
The cathode, or air electrode, is a thin porous layer on the electrolyte where oxygen reduction takes place. The overall reaction is written in Kröger-Vink Notation as follows:

:formula_1
Cathode materials must be, at a minimum, electrically conductive. Currently, lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) is the cathode material of choice for commercial use because of its compatibility with doped zirconia electrolytes. Mechanically, it has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to YSZ and thus limits stress buildup because of CTE mismatch. Also, LSM has low levels of chemical reactivity with YSZ which extends the lifetime of the materials. Unfortunately, LSM is a poor ionic conductor, and so the electrochemically active reaction is limited to the triple phase boundary (TPB) where the electrolyte, air and electrode meet. LSM works well as a cathode at high temperatures, but its performance quickly falls as the operating temperature is lowered below 800 °C. In order to increase the reaction zone beyond the TPB, a potential cathode material must be able to conduct both electrons and oxygen ions. Composite cathodes consisting of LSM YSZ have been used to increase this triple phase boundary length. Mixed ionic/electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramics, such as perovskite LSCF, are also being researched for use in intermediate temperature SOFCs as they are more active and can make up for the increase in the activation energy of the reaction.

===Interconnect===
The interconnect can be either a metallic or ceramic layer that sits between each individual cell. Its purpose is to connect each cell in series, so that the electricity each cell generates can be combined. Because the interconnect is exposed to both the oxidizing and reducing side of the cell at high temperatures, it must be extremely stable. For this reason, ceramics have been more successful in the long term than metals as interconnect materials. However, these ceramic interconnect materials are very expensive when compared to metals. Nickel- and steel-based alloys are becoming more promising as lower temperature (600–800 °C) SOFCs are developed. The material of choice for an interconnect in contact with Y8SZ is a metallic 95Cr-5Fe alloy. Ceramic-metal composites called &quot;cermet&quot; are also under consideration, as they have demonstrated thermal stability at high temperatures and excellent electrical conductivity.

==Polarizations==

Polarizations, or overpotentials, are losses in voltage due to imperfections in materials, microstructure, and design of the fuel cell. Polarizations result from ohmic resistance of oxygen ions conducting through the electrolyte (iRΩ), electrochemical activation barriers at the anode and cathode, and finally concentration polarizations due to inability of gases to diffuse at high rates through the porous anode and cathode (shown as ηA for the anode and ηC for cathode). The cell voltage can be calculated using the following equation:

:formula_2

where:
*formula_3 = Nernst potential of the reactants 
*formula_4 = Thévenin equivalent resistance value of the electrically conducting portions of the cell
*formula_5 = polarization losses in the cathode
*formula_6 = polarization losses in the anode

In SOFCs, it is often important to focus on the ohmic and concentration polarizations since high operating temperatures experience little activation polarization. However, as the lower limit of SOFC operating temperature is approached (~600 °C), these polarizations do become important.

Above mentioned equation is used for determining the SOFC voltage (in fact for fuel cell voltage in general). This approach results in good agreement with particular experimental data (for which
adequate factors were obtained) and poor agreement for other than original experimental working parameters. Moreover, most of the equations used require the addition of numerous factors which are difficult or impossible to determine. It makes very difficult any optimizing process of the SOFC working parameters as well as design architecture configuration selection. Because of those circumstances a few other equations were proposed:

:formula_7

where: 
*formula_8 = cell voltage
*formula_9 = maximum voltage given by the Nernst equation
*formula_10 = maximum current density (for given fuel flow)
*formula_11 = fuel utilization factor
*formula_12 = ionic specific resistance of the electrolyte
*formula_13 = electric specific resistance of the electrolyte.

This method was validated and found to be suitable for optimization and sensitivity studies in plant-level modelling of various systems with solid oxide fuel cells. With this mathematical description it is possible to account for different properties of the SOFC. There are many parameters which impact cell working conditions, e.g. electrolyte material, electrolyte thickness, cell temperature, inlet and outlet gas compositions at anode and cathode, and electrode porosity, just to name some. The flow in these systems is often calculated using the Navier–Stokes equations.

===Ohmic polarization===

Ohmic losses in an SOFC result from ionic conductivity through the electrolyte and electrical resistance offered to the flow of electrons in the external electrical circuit. This is inherently a materials property of the crystal structure and atoms involved. However, to maximize the ionic conductivity, several methods can be done. Firstly, operating at higher temperatures can significantly decrease these ohmic losses. Substitutional doping methods to further refine the crystal structure and control defect concentrations can also play a significant role in increasing the conductivity. Another way to decrease ohmic resistance is to decrease the thickness of the electrolyte layer.

====Ionic conductivity====
An ionic specific resistance of the electrolyte as a function of temperature can be described by the following relationship:

:formula_14

where: formula_15 – electrolyte thickness, and formula_16 – ionic conductivity.

The ionic conductivity of the solid oxide is defined as follows:

:formula_17

where: formula_18 and formula_19 – factors depended on electrolyte materials, formula_20 – electrolyte temperature, and formula_4 – ideal gas constant.

===Concentration polarization===

The concentration polarization is the result of practical limitations on mass transport within the cell and represents the voltage loss due to spatial variations in reactant concentration at the chemically active sites. This situation can be caused when the reactants are consumed by the electrochemical reaction faster than they can diffuse into the porous electrode, and can also be caused by variation in bulk flow composition. The latter is due to the fact that the consumption of reacting species in the reactant flows causes a drop in reactant concentration as it travels along the cell, which causes a drop in the local potential near the tail end of the cell.

The concentration polarization occurs in both the anode and cathode. The anode can be particularly problematic, as the oxidation of the hydrogen produces steam, which further dilutes the fuel stream as it travels along the length of the cell. This polarization can be mitigated by reducing the reactant utilization fraction or increasing the electrode porosity, but these approaches each have significant design trade-offs.

===Activation polarization===
The activation polarization is the result of the kinetics involved with the electrochemical reactions. Each reaction has a certain activation barrier that must be overcome in order to proceed and this barrier leads to the polarization. The activation barrier is the result of many complex electrochemical reaction steps where typically the rate limiting step is responsible for the polarization. The polarization equation shown below is found by solving the Butler–Volmer equation in the high current density regime (where the cell typically operates), and can be used to estimate the activation polarization:

:formula_22

Where:

formula_23 = failure stress of the small deformation

formula_24 = critical applied force

formula_25 = height of the sample

formula_26 = Poisson&#x27;s ratio

formula_27 = diameter (sup = support ring, load = loading ring, s = sample)

However, this equation is not valid for deflections exceeding 1/2h, making it less applicable for thin samples, which are of great interest in SOFCs. Therefore, while this method does not require knowledge of crack or pore size, it must be used with great caution and is more applicable to support layers in SOFCs than active layers. In addition to failure stresses and fracture toughness, modern fuel cell designs that favor mixed ionic electronic conductors (MIECs), Creep (deformation) pose another great problem, as MIEC electrodes often operate at temperatures exceeding half of the melting temperature. As a result, diffusion creep must also be considered.

formula_28

Where:

formula_29 = equivalent creep strain

formula_27 = Diffusion coefficient

formula_31 = temperature

formula_32 = kinetic constant

formula_33 = equivalent stress (e.g. von Mises)

formula_34 = creep stress exponential factor

formula_35 = particle size exponent (2 for Nabarro–Herring creep, 3 for Coble creep)

To properly model creep strain rates, knowledge of Microstructure is therefore of significant importance. Due to the difficulty in mechanically testing SOFCs at high temperatures, and due to the microstructural evolution of SOFCs over the lifetime of operation resulting from Grain growth and coarsening, the actual creep behavior of SOFCs is currently not completely understood

==Target==
DOE target requirements are 40,000 hours of service for stationary fuel cell applications and greater than 5,000 hours for transportation systems (fuel cell vehicles) at a factory cost of $40/kW for a 10 kW coal-based system without additional requirements. Lifetime effects (phase stability, thermal expansion compatibility, element migration, conductivity and aging) must be addressed. The Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance 2008 (interim) target for overall degradation per 1,000 hours is 4.0%.

==Research==
Research is going now in the direction of lower-temperature SOFCs (600 °C). Low temperature systems can reduce costs by reducing insulation, materials, start-up and degradation-related costs. With higher operating temperatures, the temperature gradient increases the severity of thermal stresses, which affects materials cost and life of the system. An intermediate temperature system (650-800 °C) would enable the use of cheaper metallic materials with better mechanical properties and thermal conductivity. New developments in nano-scale electrolyte structures have been shown to bring down operating temperatures to around 350 °C, which would enable the use of even cheaper steel and elastomeric/polymeric components.

Lowering operating temperatures has the added benefit of increased efficiency. Theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases with decreasing temperature. For example, the efficiency of a SOFC using CO as fuel increases from 63% to 81% when decreasing the system temperature from 900 °C to 350 °C.

Research is also under way to improve the fuel flexibility of SOFCs. While stable operation has been achieved on a variety of hydrocarbon fuels, these cells typically rely on external fuel processing. In the case of natural gas, the fuel is either externally or internally reformed and the sulfur compounds are removed. These processes add to the cost and complexity of SOFC systems. Work is under way at a number of institutions to improve the stability of anode materials for hydrocarbon oxidation and, therefore, relax the requirements for fuel processing and decrease SOFC balance of plant costs.

Research is also going on in reducing start-up time to be able to implement SOFCs in mobile applications. This can be partially achieved by lowering operating temperatures, which is the case for proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs). Due to their fuel flexibility, they may run on partially reformed diesel, and this makes SOFCs interesting as auxiliary power units (APU) in refrigerated trucks.

Specifically, Delphi Automotive Systems are developing an SOFC that will power auxiliary units in automobiles and tractor-trailers, while BMW has recently stopped a similar project. A high-temperature SOFC will generate all of the needed electricity to allow the engine to be smaller and more efficient. The SOFC would run on the same gasoline or diesel as the engine and would keep the air conditioning unit and other necessary electrical systems running while the engine shuts off when not needed (e.g., at a stop light or truck stop).

Rolls-Royce is developing solid-oxide fuel cells produced by screen printing onto inexpensive ceramic materials. Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Ltd is developing an SOFC gas turbine hybrid system fueled by natural gas for power generation applications in the order of a megawatt (e.g. Futuregen).

3D printing is being explored as a possible manufacturing technique that could be used to make SOFC manufacturing easier by the Shah Lab at Northwestern University. This manufacturing technique would allow SOFC cell structure to be more flexible, which could lead to more efficient designs. This process could work in the production of any part of the cell. The 3D printing process works by combining about 80% ceramic particles with 20% binders and solvents, and then converting that slurry into an ink that can be fed into a 3D printer. Some of the solvent is very volatile, so the ceramic ink solidifies almost immediately. Not all of the solvent evaporates, so the ink maintains some flexibility before it is fired at high temperature to densify it. This flexibility allows the cells to be fired in a circular shape that would increase the surface area over which electrochemical reactions can occur, which increases the efficiency of the cell. Also, the 3D printing technique allows the cell layers to be printed on top of each other instead of having to go through separate manufacturing and stacking steps. The thickness is easy to control, and layers can be made in the exact size and shape that is needed, so waste is minimized.

Ceres Power Ltd. has developed a low cost and low temperature (500–600 degrees) SOFC stack using cerium gadolinium oxide (CGO) in place of current industry standard ceramic, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), which allows the use of stainless steel to support the ceramic.

Solid Cell Inc. has developed a unique, low-cost cell architecture that combines properties of planar and tubular designs, along with a Cr-free cermet interconnect.

The high temperature electrochemistry center (HITEC) at the University of Florida, Gainesville is focused on studying ionic transport, electrocatalytic phenomena and microstructural characterization of ion conducting materials.

SiEnergy Systems, a Harvard spin-off company, has demonstrated the first macro-scale thin-film solid-oxide fuel cell that can operate at 500 degrees.

===SOEC===
A solid oxide electrolyser cell (SOEC) is a solid oxide fuel cell set in regenerative mode for the electrolysis of water with a solid oxide, or ceramic, electrolyte to produce oxygen and hydrogen gas.

SOECs can also be used to do electrolysis of CO2 to produce CO and oxygen or even co-electrolysis of water and CO2 to produce syngas and oxygen.

===ITSOFC===
SOFCs that operate in an intermediate temperature (IT) range, meaning between 600 and 800 °C, are named ITSOFCs. Because of the high degradation rates and materials costs incurred at temperatures in excess of 900 °C, it is economically more favorable to operate SOFCs at lower temperatures. The push for high-performance ITSOFCs is currently the topic of much research and development. One area of focus is the cathode material. It is thought that the oxygen reduction reaction is responsible for much of the loss in performance so the catalytic activity of the cathode is being studied and enhanced through various techniques, including catalyst impregnation. The research on NdCrO3 proves it to be a potential cathode material for the cathode of ITSOFC since it is thermochemically stable within the temperature range.

Another area of focus is electrolyte materials. To make SOFCs competitive in the market, ITSOFCs are pushing towards lower operational temperature by use of alternative new materials. However, efficiency and stability of the materials limit their feasibility. One choice for the electrolyte new materials is the ceria-salt ceramic composites (CSCs). The two-phase CSC electrolytes GDC (gadolinium-doped ceria) and SDC (samaria-doped ceria)-MCO3 (M=Li, Na, K, single or mixture of carbonates) can reach the power density of 300-800 mW*cm−2.

===LT-SOFC===
Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs), operating lower than 650 °C, are of great interest for future research because the high operating temperature is currently what restricts the development and deployment of SOFCs. A low-temperature SOFC is more reliable due to smaller thermal mismatch and easier sealing. Additionally, a lower temperature requires less insulation and therefore has a lower cost. Cost is further lowered due to wider material choices for interconnects and compressive nonglass/ceramic seals. Perhaps most importantly, at a lower temperature, SOFCs can be started more rapidly and with less energy, which lends itself to uses in portable and transportable applications.

As temperature decreases, the maximum theoretical fuel cell efficiency increases, in contrast to the Carnot cycle. For example, the maximum theoretical efficiency of an SOFC using CO as a fuel increases from 63% at 900 °C to 81% at 350 °C.

This is a materials issue, particularly for the electrolyte in the SOFC. YSZ is the most commonly used electrolyte because of its superior stability, despite not having the highest conductivity. Currently, the thickness of YSZ electrolytes is a minimum of ~10 μm due to deposition methods, and this requires a temperature above 700 °C. Therefore, low-temperature SOFCs are only possible with higher conductivity electrolytes. Various alternatives that could be successful at low temperature include gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) and erbia-cation-stabilized bismuth (ERB). They have superior ionic conductivity at lower temperatures, but this comes at the expense of lower thermodynamic stability. CeO2 electrolytes become electronically conductive and Bi2O3 electrolytes decompose to metallic Bi under the reducing fuel environment.

To combat this, researchers created a functionally graded ceria/bismuth-oxide bilayered electrolyte where the GDC layer on the anode side protects the ESB layer from decomposing while the ESB on the cathode side blocks the leakage current through the GDC layer. This leads to near-theoretical open-circuit potential (OPC) with two highly conductive electrolytes, that by themselves would not have been sufficiently stable for the application. This bilayer proved to be stable for 1400 hours of testing at 500 °C and showed no indication of interfacial phase formation or thermal mismatch. While this makes strides towards lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs, it also opens doors for future research to try and understand this mechanism.

Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology dealt with the instability of BaCeO3 differently. They replaced a desired fraction of Ce in BaCeO3 with Zr to form a solid solution that exhibits proton conductivity, but also chemical and thermal stability over the range of conditions relevant to fuel cell operation. A new specific composition, Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ (BZCY7) that displays the highest ionic conductivity of all known electrolyte materials for SOFC applications. This electrolyte was fabricated by dry-pressing powders, which allowed for the production of crack free films thinner than 15 μm. The implementation of this simple and cost-effective fabrication method may enable significant cost reductions in SOFC fabrication. However, this electrolyte operates at higher temperatures than the bilayered electrolyte model, closer to 600 °C rather than 500 °C.

Currently, given the state of the field for LT-SOFCs, progress in the electrolyte would reap the most benefits, but research into potential anode and cathode materials would also lead to useful results, and has started to be discussed more frequently in literature.

===SOFC-GT===
An SOFC-GT system is one which comprises a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine. Such systems have been evaluated by Siemens Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce as a means to achieve higher operating efficiencies by running the SOFC under pressure. SOFC-GT systems typically include anodic and/or cathodic atmosphere recirculation, thus increasing efficiency.

Theoretically, the combination of the SOFC and gas turbine can give result in high overall (electrical and thermal) efficiency. Further combination of the SOFC-GT in a combined cooling, heat and power (or trigeneration) configuration (via HVAC) also has the potential to yield even higher thermal efficiencies in some cases.

Another feature of the introduced hybrid system is on the gain of 100% CO2 capturing at comparable high energy efficiency. These features like zero CO2 emission and high energy efficiency make the power plant performance noteworthy.

===DCFC===
For the direct use of solid coal fuel without additional gasification and reforming processes, a direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) has been developed as a promising novel concept of a high-temperature energy conversion system. The underlying progress in the development of a coal-based DCFC has been categorized mainly according to the electrolyte materials used, such as solid oxide, molten carbonate, and molten hydroxide, as well as hybrid systems consisting of solid oxide and molten carbonate binary electrolyte or of liquid anode (Fe, Ag, In, Sn, Sb, Pb, Bi, and its alloying and its metal/metal oxide) solid oxide electrolyte. People&#x27;s research on DCFC with GDC-Li/Na2CO3 as the electrolyte, Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 as cathode shows good performance. The highest power density of 48 mW*cm−2 can be reached at 500 °C with O2 and CO2 as oxidant and the whole system is stable within the temperature range of 500 °C to 600 °C.

SOFC operated on landfill gas

Every household produces waste/garbage on a daily basis. In 2009, Americans produced about 243 million tons of municipal solid waste, which is 4.3 pounds of waste per person per day. All that waste is sent to landfill sites. Landfill gas which is produced from the decomposition of waste that gets accumulated at the landfills has the potential to be a valuable source of energy since methane is a major constituent. Currently, the majority of the landfills either burn away their gas in flares or combust it in mechanical engines to produce electricity. The issue with mechanical engines is that incomplete combustion of gasses can lead to pollution of the atmosphere and is also highly inefficient.

The issue with using landfill gas to fuel an SOFC system is that landfill gas contains hydrogen sulfide. Any landfill accepting biological waste will contain about 50-60 ppm of hydrogen sulfide and around 1-2 ppm mercaptans. However, construction materials containing reducible sulfur species, principally sulfates found in gypsum-based wallboard, can cause considerably higher levels of sulfides in the hundreds of ppm. At operating temperatures of 750 °C hydrogen sulfide concentrations of around 0.05 ppm begin to affect the performance of the SOFCs.

Ni + H2S → NiS + H2

The above reaction controls the effect of sulfur on the anode.

This can be prevented by having background hydrogen which is calculated below.

At 453 K the equilibrium constant is 7.39 x 10−5

ΔG calculated at 453 K was 35.833 kJ/mol

Using the standard heat of formation and entropy ΔG at room temperature (298 K) came out to be 45.904 kJ/mol

On extrapolation to 1023 K, ΔG is -1.229 kJ/mol

On substitution, Keq at 1023 K is 1.44 x 10−4. Hence theoretically we need 3.4% hydrogen to prevent the formation of NiS at 5 ppm H2S.

=== RSOC ===
The need for innovation in the energy storage market has brought upon research in reversible solid-oxide cells (RSOCs). These cells are able to make a power-power conversion by operating alternatively as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which can aide in the next generation of green energy technologies that are facing energy transportation and storage difficulties. In 2023, 34% of the energy provided to the grid was “rejected” or lost in the process, meaning that it did not reach the final output that it was meant for (i.e. heat emitted from a lightbulb instead of only photon emissions). A surefire method to convert green hydrogen to energy, or energy to hydrogen as storage, would help considerably reduce energy losses and improve the total efficiency of emerging green energy technologies.

RSOCs operate similarly to normal SOFCs but can either consume hydrogen fuel to produce electricity (energy production) and oxygen or work the other way around and consume electricity and oxygen to produce hydrogen (energy storage). Because of this, the use of the terms “anode” and “cathode” are obsolete as both electrodes can operate as either an anode or cathode depending on the direction of fuel consumption. Better terminology would be the “fuel electrode” and “oxygen electrode”, where the fuel cathode either consumes and oxidizes the fuel (SOFC configuration) or reduces the products to provide fuel (SOEC configuration). The oxygen electrode would either reduce oxygen (SOFC configuration) or oxidize oxygen ions to produce oxygen gas (SOEC configuration). Similarly to SOFCs, the fuel electrode is typically made of a mixture of nickel and yttrium-stabilized zirconia. The oxygen electrode is typically made of perovskite materials, like lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LCSF) and lanthanum strontium chromite (LSC). 

Research interest for RSOCs greatly involves the oxygen cathode material. As mentioned above, the traditional material for an RSOC oxygen cathode is a perovskite. Perovskites (formula ABO3) are used because of their cubic structure that allows for oxygen conductivity. Among perovskites, the ones used for an RSOC have a lanthanide or an alkaline earth metal ion in the A site and a small radius transition metal in the B site. Common problems arise when considering the various operating modes, high temperatures, and need for longevity.

Various combinations of perovskites have been and are currently being researched for the resulting performance in an RSOC. Sr-doped LaMnO3 is the most traditional perovskite, but its low ionic conductivity results in poor performance in SOEC configuration. Perovskites with cobalt instead of manganese in the B site are of great research because of their high electronic conductivity. Strontium (Sr) and Barium (Ba) doping in the A site is common because it enhances the pseudo capacitance of the perovskite. Many more combinations of different metals in perovskite structures are undergoing research for their use in RSOC and solar cell applications.

<text>Molten-carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) are high-temperature fuel cells that operate at temperatures of 600 °C and above.

Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) were developed for natural gas, biogas (produced as a result of anaerobic digestion or biomass gasification), and coal-based power plants for electrical utility, industrial, and military applications. MCFCs are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic matrix of beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE). Since they operate at extremely high temperatures of 650 °C (roughly 1,200 °F) and above, non-precious metals can be used as catalysts at the anode and cathode, reducing costs.

Improved efficiency is another reason MCFCs offer significant cost reductions over phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs). Molten carbonate fuel cells can reach efficiencies approaching 60%, considerably higher than the 37–42% efficiencies of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant. When the waste heat is captured and used, overall fuel efficiencies can be as high as 85%.

Unlike alkaline, phosphoric acid, and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, MCFCs don&#x27;t require an external reformer to convert more energy-dense fuels to hydrogen. Due to the high temperatures at which MCFCs operate, these fuels are converted to hydrogen within the fuel cell itself by a process called internal reforming, which also reduces cost.

Molten carbonate fuel cells are not prone to poisoning by carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide — they can even use carbon oxides as fuel — making them more attractive for fueling with gases made from coal. Because they are more resistant to impurities than other fuel cell types, scientists believe that they could even be capable of internal reforming of coal, assuming they can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal, a dirtier fossil fuel source than many others, into hydrogen. Alternatively, because MCFCs require CO2 be delivered to the cathode along with the oxidizer, they can be used to electrochemically separate carbon dioxide from the flue gas of other fossil fuel power plants for sequestration.

The primary disadvantage of current MCFC technology is durability. The high temperatures at which these cells operate and the corrosive electrolyte used accelerate component breakdown and corrosion, decreasing cell life. Scientists are currently exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that increase cell life without decreasing performance.

== Operation ==

=== Background ===
Molten carbonate FCs are a recently developed type of fuel cell that targets small and large energy distribution/generation systems since their power production is in the 0.3-3 MW range. The operating pressure is between 1-8 atm while the temperatures are between 600 and 700 °C. Due to the production of CO2 during reforming of the fossil fuel (methane, natural gas), MCFCs are not a completely green technology, but are promising due to their reliability and efficiency (sufficient heat for co-generation with electricity). Current MCFC efficiencies range from 60 to 70%.

=== Materials ===
Due to the high operating temperatures of MCFCs, the materials need to be very carefully selected to survive the conditions present within the cell. The following sections cover the various materials present in the fuel cell and recent developments in research.

==== Anode ====
The anode material typically consists of a porous (3-6 μm, 45-70% material porosity) Ni based alloy. Ni is alloyed with either Chromium or Aluminum in the 2-10% range. These alloying elements allow for formation of LiCrO2/LiAlO2 at the grain boundaries, which increases the materials&#x27; creep resistance and prevents sintering of the anode at the high operating temperatures of the fuel cell. Recent research has looked at using nano Ni and other Ni alloys to increase the performance and decrease the operating temperature of the fuel cell. A reduction in operating temperature would extend the lifetime of the fuel cell (i.e. decrease corrosion rate) and allow for use of cheaper component materials. At the same time, a decrease in temperature would decrease ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and thus, the anode materials need to compensate for this performance decline (e.g. by increasing power density). Other researchers have looked into enhancing creep resistance by using a Ni3Al alloy anode to reduce mass transport of Ni in the anode when in operation.

==== Cathode ====
On the other side of the cell, the cathode material is composed of either Lithium metatitanate or of a porous Ni that is converted to a lithiated nickel oxide (lithium is intercalated within the NiO crystal structure). The pore size within the cathode is in the range of 7-15 μm with 60-70% of the material being porous. The primary issue with the cathode material is dissolution of NiO since it reacts with CO2 when the cathode is in contact with the carbonate electrolyte. This dissolution leads to precipitation of Ni metal in the electrolyte and since it is electrically conductive, the fuel cell can get short circuited. Therefore, current studies have looked into the addition of MgO to the NiO cathode to limit this dissolution. Magnesium oxide serves to reduce the solubility of Ni2+ in the cathode and decreases precipitation in the electrolyte. Alternatively, replacement of the conventional cathode material with a LiFeO2-LiCoO2-NiO alloy has shown promising performance results and almost completely avoids the problem of Ni dissolution of the cathode.

==== Electrolyte ====
MCFCs use a liquid electrolyte (molten carbonate) which consists of a sodium(Na) and potassium(K) carbonate. This electrolyte is supported by a ceramic (LiAlO2) matrix to contain the liquid between the electrodes. The high temperatures of the fuel cell is required to produce sufficient ionic conductivity of carbonate through this electrolyte. Common MCFC electrolytes contain 62% Li2CO3 and 38% K2CO3. A greater fraction of Li carbonate is used due to its higher ionic conductivity but is limited to 62% due to its lower gas solubility and ionic diffusivity of oxygen. In addition, Li2CO3 is a very corrosive electrolyte and this ratio of carbonates provides the lowest corrosion rate. Due to these issues, recent studies have delved into replacing the potassium carbonate with a sodium carbonate. A Li/Na electrolyte has shown to have better performance (higher conductivity) and improves the stability of the cathode when compared to a Li/K electrolyte (Li/K is more basic). In addition, scientists have also looked into modifying the matrix of the electrolyte to prevent issues such as phase changes (γ-LiAlO2 to α-LiAlO2) in the material during cell operation. The phase change accompanies a volume decrease in the electrolyte which leads to lower ionic conductivity. Through various studies, it has been found that an alumina doped α-LiAlO2 matrix would improve the phase stability while maintaining the fuel cell&#x27;s performance.

==MTU fuel cell==
The German company MTU Friedrichshafen presented an MCFC at the Hannover Fair in 2006. The unit weighs 2 tonnes and can produce 240 kW of electric power from various gaseous fuels, including biogas. If fueled by fuels that contain carbon such as natural gas, the exhaust will contain CO2 but will be reduced by up to 50% compared to diesel engines running on marine bunker fuel. The exhaust temperature is 400 °C, hot enough to be used for many industrial processes. Another possibility is to make more electric power via a steam turbine. Depending on feed gas type, the electric efficiency is between 12% and 19%. A steam turbine can increase the efficiency by up to 24%. The unit can be used for cogeneration.

<doc id="1049639" wikidata="Q899342" url="?curid=1049639" title="Alkaline fuel cell">
<text>The alkaline fuel cell (AFC), also known as the Bacon fuel cell after its British inventor, Francis Thomas Bacon, is one of the most developed fuel cell technologies. Alkaline fuel cells consume hydrogen and pure oxygen, to produce potable water, heat, and electricity. They are among the most efficient fuel cells, having the potential to reach 70%.

NASA has used alkaline fuel cells since the mid-1960s, in the Apollo-series missions and on the Space Shuttle.

==Half Reactions==
The fuel cell produces power through a redox reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. At the anode, hydrogen is oxidized according to the reaction:

formula_1

producing water and releasing electrons. The electrons flow through an external circuit and return to the cathode, reducing oxygen in the reaction:

formula_2

producing hydroxide ions. The net reaction consumes one oxygen molecule and two hydrogen molecules in the production of two water molecules. Electricity and heat are formed as by-products of this reaction.

==Electrolyte==
The two electrodes are separated by a porous matrix saturated with an aqueous alkaline solution, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH). Aqueous alkaline solutions do not reject carbon dioxide (CO2) so the fuel cell can become &quot;poisoned&quot; through the conversion of KOH to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Because of this, alkaline fuel cells typically operate on pure oxygen, or at least purified air and would incorporate a &#x27;scrubber&#x27; into the design to clean out as much of the carbon dioxide as is possible. Because the generation and storage requirements of oxygen make pure-oxygen AFCs expensive, there are few companies engaged in active development of the technology. There is, however, some debate in the research community over whether the poisoning is permanent or reversible. The main mechanisms of poisoning are blocking of the pores in the cathode with K2CO3, which is not reversible, and reduction in the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, which may be reversible by returning the KOH to its original concentration. An alternate method involves simply replacing the KOH which returns the cell back to its original output.

When carbon dioxide reacts with the electrolyte carbonates are formed. The carbonates could precipitate on the pores of electrodes that eventually block them. It has been found that AFCs operating at higher temperature do not show a reduction in performance, whereas at around room temperature, a significant drop in performance has been shown. The carbonate poisoning at ambient temperature is thought to be a result of the low solubility of K2CO3 around room temperature, which leads to precipitation of K2CO3 that blocks the electrode pores. Also, these precipitants gradually decrease the hydrophobicity of the electrode backing layer leading to structural degradation and electrode flooding.

formula_3

On the other hand, the charge-carrying hydroxide ions in the electrolyte can react with carbon dioxide from organic fuel oxidation (i.e. methanol, formic acid) or air to form carbonate species.

formula_4

Carbonate formation depletes hydroxide ions from the electrolyte, which reduces electrolyte conductivity and consequently cell performance.
As well as these bulk effects, the effect on water management due to a change in vapor pressure and/or a change in electrolyte volume can be detrimental as well.

==Basic designs==
Because of this poisoning effect, two main variants of AFCs exist: static electrolyte and flowing electrolyte. Static, or immobilized, electrolyte cells of the type used in the Apollo space craft and the Space Shuttle typically use an asbestos separator saturated in potassium hydroxide. Water production is controlled by evaporation from the anode, which produces pure water that may be reclaimed for other uses. These fuel cells typically use platinum catalysts to achieve maximum volumetric and specific efficiencies.

Flowing electrolyte designs use a more open matrix that allows the electrolyte to flow either between the electrodes (parallel to the electrodes) or through the electrodes in a transverse direction (the ASK-type or EloFlux fuel cell). In parallel-flow electrolyte designs, the water produced is retained in the electrolyte, and old electrolyte may be exchanged for fresh, in a manner analogous to an oil change in a car. More space is required between electrodes to enable this flow, and this translates into an increase in cell resistance, decreasing power output compared to immobilized electrolyte designs. A further challenge for the technology is how severe the problem of permanent blocking of the cathode is by K2CO3; some published reports have indicated thousands of hours of operation on air.
These designs have used both platinum and non-noble metal catalysts, resulting in increased efficiencies and increased cost. 

The EloFlux design, with its transverse flow of electrolyte, has the advantage of low-cost construction and replaceable electrolyte but so far has only been demonstrated using oxygen. 

The electrodes consist of a double layer structure: an active electrocatalyst layer and a hydrophobic layer. The active layer consists of an organic mixture which is ground and then rolled at room temperature to form a crosslinked self-supporting sheet. The hydrophobic structure prevents the electrolyte from leaking into the reactant gas flow channels and ensures diffusion of the gases to the reaction site. The two layers are then pressed onto a conducting metal mesh, and sintering completes the process.

Further variations on the alkaline fuel cell include the metal hydride fuel cell and the direct borohydride fuel cell.

==Advantages over acidic fuel cells==
Alkaline fuel cells operate between ambient temperature and 90 °C with an electrical efficiency higher than fuel cells with acidic electrolyte, such as proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), solid oxide fuel cells, and phosphoric acid fuel cells. Because of the alkaline chemistry, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode are much more facile than in acidic cells, allowing use of non-noble metals, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, or carbon-based nanomaterial at the anode (where fuel is oxidized); and cheaper catalysts such as silver at the cathode, due to the low overpotentials associated with electrochemical reactions at high pH.

An alkaline medium also accelerates oxidation of fuels like methanol, making them more attractive.
This results in less pollution compared to acidic fuel cells.

==Commercial prospects==
AFCs are the cheapest of fuel cells to manufacture. The catalyst required for the electrodes can be any of a number of different chemicals that are inexpensive compared to those required for other types of fuel cells.

The commercial prospects for AFCs lie largely with the recently developed bi-polar plate version of this technology, considerably superior in performance to earlier mono-plate versions.

The world&#x27;s first fuel-cell ship, the &quot;Hydra&quot;, used an AFC system with 5 kW net output.

Another recent development is the solid-state alkaline fuel cell, utilizing a solid anion-exchange membrane instead of a liquid electrolyte. This resolves the problem of poisoning and allows the development of alkaline fuel cells capable of running on safer hydrogen-rich carriers such as liquid urea solutions or metal amine complexes.

<text>Mohammad Yusuf Dahlan (, also known by the &quot;kunya&quot; Abu Fadi (), born 29 September 1961) is a Palestinian politician. Arrested by Israel for being involved with the Fatah Hawksthe Fatah youth movementhe subsequently helped in negotiations for the Oslo Accords, later becoming a critic of Yasser Arafat. The former leader of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, Dahlan&#x27;s power there as head of the Preventive Security Force was at one time so substantial that the territory was nicknamed &quot;Dahlanistan&quot;. Seen as a favorite by the George W. Bush administration to be Mahmoud Abbas&#x27; second-in-command, Dahlan was appointed by the latter to head the Palestinian National Security Council. An antagonist of Hamas, he participated in the Fatah–Hamas Mecca Agreement before his power began to decline after the latter gained the upper hand in the Battle of Gaza. He was controversially elected to the Central Committee of Fatah amid allegations of fraud. Living in exile in Abu Dhabi, Dahlan has, according to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, had a hand in facilitating the Abraham Accords.

==Early life==
Dahlan was born in Khan Yunis Refugee Camp, Khan Yunis, Gaza Strip to a refugee family from Hamama, a Palestinian town depopulated in 1948. He is the youngest of six children. 

Dahlan became politically active as a teenager. In 1981, he helped to establish the Gaza branch of the Fatah youth movement Fatah Hawks in the Gaza Strip. Between 1981 and 1986, he was arrested by Israel 11 times for his leading role in the movement. During his time in prison, he learned to speak Hebrew fluently.

==Oslo years==
Dahlan became involved in negotiating the Oslo Peace Agreement. He was chosen to head the Preventive Security Force in Gaza after the signing of the Oslo Accords. He built up a force of 20,000 men, making him one of the most powerful Palestinian leaders, dealing regularly with the Central Intelligence Agency and Israeli intelligence officials. His forces were accused of torturing Hamas detainees throughout the 1990s, allegations Dahlan denies. During this period Gaza was nicknamed &quot;Dahlanistan&quot; due to his power. His reputation was damaged in the Karni scandal of 1997 when it was revealed that Dahlan was diverting 40% of the taxes levied at the Karni Crossing (an estimated one million shekels a month) to his personal bank account.

==Second Intifada==
In 2001 he upset Yasser Arafat by beginning to call for reform in the Palestinian National Authority (PA) and expressing dissatisfaction with a lack of coherent policy.

In 2002, he resigned his post as head of the Preventive Security in Gaza in the hope of becoming Interior Minister; this did not occur, and he was offered a post as security adviser but rejected it. In April 2003, he was appointed the Palestinian Minister of State for Security by Mahmoud Abbas, despite the objection of Arafat. By September he had been ousted when Abbas resigned as Prime Minister, and was replaced by Hakam Balawi.

He repeatedly tried to campaign on a reform and anti-corruption ticket and tried to profile himself as an outspoken critic of Arafat, although many observers dispute his personal integrity. Nevertheless, Dahlan and his followers in internal Fatah elections won over most of the Fatah sections in Gaza.

In 2004, Dahlan was assumed to have been behind week-long unrest in Gaza following the appointment of Arafat&#x27;s nephew Moussa Arafat as head of Gaza police forces. This appointment was considered by some a deliberate step to weaken Dahlan&#x27;s position before the Israeli disengagement from the Gaza strip and sparked massive protests.

==Gaza infighting==
On January 26, 2006, Dahlan was narrowly elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in the Palestinian legislative election of 2006 as a representative for Khan Yunis. Dahlan took a tough stance against Hamas, calling their election victory a disaster and threatening to &#x27;haunt them from now till the end of their term&#x27; and to &#x27;rough up and humiliate&#x27; Fatah supporters tempted to join the Hamas-led Palestinian government.

On December 14, 2006 gunmen attempted to assassinate Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh as he crossed Gaza&#x27;s border with Egypt, killing a bodyguard and wounding five others, and sparking further clashes between Hamas and Fatah supporters in Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas accused Dahlan of orchestrating the attack. Dahlan rejected the accusations, saying, &quot;the Hamas government is fully responsible for yesterday&#x27;s events.&quot;

On January 7, 2007, Dahlan held the biggest-ever rally of Fatah supporters in the Gaza Strip, where he denounced Hamas as &#x27;a bunch of murderers and thieves&#x27; and vowed that &#x27;we will do everything, I repeat, everything, to protect Fatah activists&#x27;. In response Hamas labeled Dahlan a &#x27;putschist&#x27; and accused him of bringing Palestinians to the brink of civil war.

Dahlan was a Fatah representative in negotiations which resulted in the Fatah–Hamas Mecca Agreement of February 8, 2007, in which both sides agreed to stop the military clashes in Gaza and form a government of national unity. In March 2007, despite objections from Hamas, Dahlan was appointed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to lead the newly re-established Palestinian National Security Council, overseeing all security forces in the Palestinian territories. Dahlan organised paramilitary units of several thousand fighters trained with American assistance in Arab countries, and lobbied Israel to allow Fatah forces in Gaza to receive large shipments of arms and ammunition to fight Hamas.

In the April 2008 edition of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; it was revealed that after the 2006 elections Dahlan had been central in a U.S. plot to remove the democratically elected Hamas-led government from power. The Americans provided money and arms to Dahlan, trained his men and ordered him to carry out a military coup against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. However, the elected Hamas government forestalled the move and itself carried out an armed counter-coup.

==Battle of Gaza==
In July 2007, Dahlan resigned from his post as national security adviser. The resignation was little more than a formality, since Mahmoud Abbas had issued a decree dissolving his national security council immediately after the Hamas takeover of Gaza. Dahlan has been blamed by many in Fatah for the rapid collapse of their forces in Gaza in the face of a Hamas offensive that lasted less than a week. During the fighting Dahlan&#x27;s house on the coast of Gaza was seized by Hamas militants and subsequently demolished. He and most of the other senior security commanders of the Fatah-dominated PA security forces were not in Gaza during the fighting, leading to charges that their men had been abandoned in the field.

==Return to West Bank==
Shortly after his forces were expelled from Gaza, Dahlan re-established himself in the West Bank. Tensions grew between his supporters and opponents when Fatah leader and former Interior Minister Hani al-Hassan gave an interview on Al-Jazeera in which he said what happened in Gaza was not a war between Fatah and Hamas; but between Hamas and Fatah collaborators who served the Americans and the Israelis, making clear that he was referring to Dahlan&#x27;s supporters. Representatives of Dahlan pressured Mahmoud Abbas to fire and punish Al-Hassan, while masked gunmen opened fire on his home in Ramallah. Al-Hassan accused Dahlan of planning to murder him, a charge which Dahlan denied.

In October 2007 the George W. Bush administration reportedly exerted heavy pressure on Abbas to appoint Dahlan as his deputy. Some Fatah officials said that the U.S. and some European Union countries had made it clear they would like to see Dahlan succeed Abbas as head of the PA.

In August 2009 Dahlan was elected to the Central Committee of Fatah. However the results were controversial, with Fatah suffering mass resignations over claims the elections were fraudulent.

== Allegation of murdering Yasser Arafat ==
In June 2011 Dahlan was expelled from Fatah because of repeated claims by Mahmoud Abbas that he had murdered Arafat. In September, his house was raided by the Palestinian police and his private armed guards were arrested. In August 2011 his former party accused him of murdering Arafat using poison. In June 2012, after a 9-month investigation launched by Al Jazeera, traces of the radioactive poison polonium were found on Arafat&#x27;s belongings, strongly increasing suspicions that he was poisoned.

==Al-Mabhouh assassination==
Hamas has claimed that two Palestinians arrested in Dubai for suspected involvement in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, Ahmad Hassanain and Anwar Shheibar, are former members of a death cell which carried out violent suppression of Hamas members, and work at a construction company in Dubai owned by Dahlan. A senior Hamas official told &quot;Al-Hayat&quot; newspaper that the two provided logistical aid to the Mossad hit team alleged to have carried out the assassination, renting them cars and hotel rooms. Dahlan denied the charges.&quot;

==Trial in absentia==
In December 2014, a trial against Dahlan on corruption charges began in Ramallah. Since he failed to appear for the trial, it was decided to try him in absentia. He was convicted for defaming president Abbas and sentenced him to two years in prison, and a year later convicted of embezzlement which added three years to his sentence.

==Influence in United Arab Emirates==
Following his expulsion from Fatah in 2011, Dahlan moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he worked as a security adviser. Dahlan developed a close relationship with Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who became the de facto ruler of Abu Dhabi in 2014 and President of the United Arab Emirates in 2022.

Dahlan assisted in organising some large UAE investments in the Balkans, and acquired Serbian citizenship.

In 2016, Turkey placed Dahlan on its the &quot;most wanted terrorist list&quot;, offering a $700,000 bounty, accusing him of involvement in the failed 2016 Turkish coup attempt.

In October 2018, Dahlan was accused of cooperating with Abraham Golan, a Hungarian-Israeli veteran of the French Foreign Legion, to hire American ex-special forces mercenaries to assassinate Yemeni al-Islah politicians as part of the United Arab Emirate&#x27;s role in the Yemeni Civil War.

&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; reported that Dahlan was influential in developing the Abraham Accords, the U.S. brokered agreements on Arab–Israeli normalization signed between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain in 2020. In 2020, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in an interview that the U.S. considers Dahlan as a future replacement for Palestinian President Abbas.

Dahlan led one of the candidate lists, Al-Mustaqbal (), for the planned 2021 Palestinian general election, though he himself did not stand in the election. However President Abbas indefinitely postponed this election a month before the planned date.

In March 2023, Dahlan argued that Israel had destroyed the option of a two-state solution, and Palestinians should now work toward a one-state solution for two peoples with equal rights. He said in an interview &quot;We, as Palestinians, must realise that the two-state solution has completely ended, and is no longer feasible on the ground because of the Israeli inflexibility and due to the measures that Israel has taken over the past 30 years.&quot;

Three weeks into the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, he gave an interview to the &quot;Economist&quot;. He suggested that after the war a two-year transitional technocratic government should be created for Gaza and the West Bank jointly. After that, elections with all Palestinian political factions standing, including Hamas, should take place for a parliamentary system of government, without a President. This Palestinian state should be internationally recognised.

==Criticism==
Other Palestinians have criticized Dahlan. Jibril Rajoub, with whom he cultivated a deep and personal rivalry, claimed in 2003 that everybody knew Dahlan was an Israeli agent. He has also been criticized for his good relationship with Arafat&#x27;s long-time financial adviser Mohammad Rashid and Dahlan&#x27;s own London-based business. Dahlan is alleged to have enriched himself through corruption; his personal wealth has been estimated at well over $120 million.

Others claim that, for the sake of deterring political rivals and counterweighting the numerous armed militias, he maintained a private army in the Gaza Strip in 2003 and 2004, which was trained and equipped by American services, with Israel intending to force a conflict between Dahlan&#x27;s forces and Hamas.

Dahlan has also faced criticism regarding his role in Gaza turmoil, especially in exchanging hostilities with rival security forces commander Ghazi al-Jabali. In 2003, Preventive Security Force gunmen raided the offices of Jabali&#x27;s General Security organization, going so far as to jam his head into his office toilet.

Dahlan was accused of initiating a smear campaign against PA Civilian Affairs Minister Hussein Sheikh in September 2012, when the latter was alleged to have been involved in a sex scandal with a female employee in his department.

Dahlan was the target of a bounty offered by the Turkish government in January 2020, offering 4 million lira (US$700,000) for information leading to his capture. The Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Dahlan of being an agent of Israeli intelligence and a financial backer of the Gülen movement.

Acting Prime Minister of PA, Nabil Shaath, alleged that Dahlan &quot;played a crucial role in shaping the deal&quot; of the Israel–United Arab Emirates peace agreement, which was denounced by the PA. Shaath accused him of &quot;neglecting the interests of his homeland&quot;. Dahlan was also branded as a &quot;traitor&quot; in the street protests of West Bank and Gaza Strip, where demonstrators trampled and torched the portraits of Donald Trump, Mohammed bin Zayed, Benjamin Netanyahu and Dahlan.

==Personal life==
Dahlan married Jaleela (born in Saudi Arabia on 1 January 1966). They have four children: Fadi (born Tunis, 5 October 1990); Firaz (born Tunis, 8 August 1992); Hadil (born Gaza, 19 October 1995); and Asil (born Gaza, 25 September 2003). All six gained Serbian citizenship together on 6 December 2013. Dahlan also holds Montenegrin citizenship since 2012. Dahlan lives in exile in Abu Dhabi, where he &quot;works closely&quot; with the ruling Al Nahyan family. He is also aligned with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

<text>Apianus is a lunar impact crater that is located on the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. It is named after 16th century German mathematician and astronomer Petrus Apianus. It is located to the northeast of the crater Aliacensis, and to the northwest of Poisson. The worn crater Krusenstern is attached to the west-northwestern rim.

== Description ==

The outer wall of the crater has been worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, and a pair of small craterlets overlay the rim to the southeast and northeast. The central crater is 63 kilometers in diameter and 2,080 meters deep. The craterlet on the southeast rim, Apianus B, is a member of a cluster of co-joined craterlets that includes Apianus T and Apianus U. The interior floor of the central crater is relatively smooth and lacks a central peak, although the surface appears somewhat convex. Only a few tiny craterlets mark the surface.

The crater is from the Nectarian period, 3.92 to 3.85 billion years ago.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Apianus.

<doc id="1049646" wikidata="Q236151" url="?curid=1049646" title="Carey Lowell">
<text>Carey Lowell (born February 11, 1961) is an American actress and former model, best known as New York Assistant DA Jamie Ross in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1996–2001, 2022) and as Bond girl Pam Bouvier in the James Bond movie &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989).

==Early life==
Lowell was born in Huntington, New York, the daughter of geologist James Lowell. She spent her childhood living in several countries, including Libya, the Netherlands, and France. In the US she also lived in Houston, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, where her family settled when she was 12. After a year at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she considered majoring in literature, she moved to New York City to pursue modeling, and worked for such clients as Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, and at one point attended New York University. She also studied at Manhattan&#x27;s Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.

==Career==
Lowell broke into acting with the film &quot;Dangerously Close&quot; followed by a small role in the Harold Ramis movie &quot;Club Paradise&quot;. She went on to roles including co-starring as Bond girl Pam Bouvier in the James Bond movie &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989) and, starting in 1996, as Assistant District Attorney Jamie Ross for two seasons on the television drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, a character she reprised in 2005 for a guest role on its spinoff, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot;, and again on the original series in 2022 when it returned for a 21st season. Immediately before getting that role, however, she had become frustrated with her acting career and had applied to study documentary filmmaking at New York University.

She took a hiatus from acting during the mid-2000s. In 2012, Lowell lent her likeness and voice while reprising her &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; role in the video game &quot;007 Legends&quot;. In 2018, she returned to TV, appearing as a guest on the show &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lowell has been married three times. Her first husband was fashion photographer John Stember, to whom she was married from 1984 to 1988.

She was married to actor Griffin Dunne from 1989 to 1995 and has a daughter, Hannah (born April 8, 1990) from the marriage. 

Lowell married actor Richard Gere in November 2002, following the birth of their child Homer James Jigme Gere, who was born on February 6, 2000. In September 2013, the two separated after 11 years of marriage. The couple spent three years in highly contested divorce proceedings in New York Supreme Court. The case was settled in October 2016.

<text>Crookston Castle is a ruined medieval castle in the Pollok area of Glasgow, Scotland. It is located some southwest of the city centre, on a hill overlooking the Levern Water, just before its confluence with the White Cart Water. Crookston Castle was built by the Stewarts of Darnley around 1400, and is set within earthworks constructed in the 12th century. Once the property of the earls and dukes of Lennox, the castle was extensively repaired following a siege in 1544, and it is the only surviving medieval castle in Glasgow.

==History==
Crookston is surrounded by a defensive ring ditch that dates back to the 12th century when Sir Robert de Croc, who also gave his name to the village of Crookston, built a timber and earth castle. Remains of a chapel founded by de Croc in 1180 have been uncovered. Evidence of an even earlier fortification on the same site has also been found. The lands of Crookston were bought by Sir Alan Stewart in 1330, and passed to Sir John Stewart of Darnley, in 1361. The Darnley Stewarts replaced the early castle with the present stone structure around 1400.

In 1489 the Stewart Earl of Lennox rebelled against James IV. James responded by bringing the cannon Mons Meg from Edinburgh and bombarding the castle, virtually destroying its western end and ensuring a quick surrender. On 3 April 1544, the castle was besieged and taken by the Earl of Arran and Cardinal Beaton, while the then Earl of Lennox was defending Glasgow Castle. At this time, Crookston was regarded as the principal house of the earls of Lennox. Regent Arran installed five gunners in the castle in May 1544.

Most famous of the Darnley Stewarts was Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was second husband to Mary, Queen of Scots. It may have been at Crookston that the couple were betrothed, under a yew tree. The yew was felled in 1816, and a model of Crookston Castle, now on display in Pollok House, was carved from its wood. In 1572, Crookston was granted to another Stewart, Charles, the Earl of Lennox.

In 1703 the Duke of Lennox sold the castle to the Duke of Montrose, and it remained the property of the Dukes of Montrose until 1757, when it was sold by William Graham, 2nd Duke of Montrose to the Maxwells of Pollok. Following several years of abandonment, the castle was partially restored by the Maxwells in 1847, to honour Queen Victoria&#x27;s visit to Glasgow. In 1931, Crookston became the first property acquired by the National Trust for Scotland, having been presented by Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell, who was one of the Trust&#x27;s founder members and first Vice Presidents. During the Second World War the north-eastern tower was used as an aircraft watch tower. 

Today, Crookston Castle is a scheduled monument. Its maintenance is the responsibility of Historic Environment Scotland, and the castle is open to the public. It is the second-oldest building in Glasgow, after Glasgow Cathedral.

==Architecture==

Crookston Castle sits atop a natural hill, emphasised by the early ring ditch, which can still be seen. To the north is a steep drop to the Levern Water. The castle has a rectangular main block, which was strengthened by a tower at each corner. This formed an irregular &#x27;X-plan&#x27; shape, an unusual layout also seen at Hermitage Castle. Only the north-east corner tower survives to its former height, as well as the basement of the south-east tower. The two western towers were destroyed in the 15th century and never rebuilt, repairs in the 19th century have obscured even the remains of these. The main body of the castle measures about 19 m by 12 m, with walls up to 3.7 m thick, and the north-east tower is around 6m square.

The entrance is on the north side, adjacent to the north-east tower, and defended by a portcullis and two doors. A straight mural stair leads up to the right, while ahead is a barrel-vaulted basement with slit windows and a well. The hall is at first-floor level, and was also vaulted, rising to 8.3 m high. A turnpike stair in the south-east corner gave access to another storey above the hall, as well as upper rooms in the eastern towers. The towers had one room on each floor. In the basement of the north-east tower is a prison only accessible from above, while at the top there is access to the four storeys of the tower, via modern iron ladders, opening onto an impressive view from the roof. The top of the north-east tower, including corbels, was also rebuilt in the 19th century.

==Verse and fiction==
The poets Robert Burns, William Motherwell and Robert Tannahill have all mentioned the castle in their works, while Sir Walter Scott, in his 1820 novel &quot;The Abbot&quot;, suggested Mary, Queen of Scots, watched the Battle of Langside from beneath its yew tree, although the topography makes this impossible.

<text>yellowTAB was a German software firm that produced an operating system called &quot;yellowTAB ZETA&quot;. While the operating system was based on BeOS 5.1.0, the company never publicly confirmed that it has the BeOS source code or what their licensing agreement with BeOS&#x27;s owners PalmSource was. The company went insolvent and ceased trading in 2006. Later, David Schlesinger, directory of Open Source technologies at ACCESS, Inc., which had meanwhile become the owner of the BeOS source code, stated that there had never been a license agreement covering yellowTAB&#x27;s use of the source code and that ZETA was therefore an infringed copy.

The company&#x27;s offices were in Mannheim, and its corporate motto was &quot;Assume The Power&quot;. Following their closure, the OS was taken over by magnussoft, who started selling it as &quot;magnussoft ZETA&quot;.

yellowTAB has come under some criticism from the BeOS userbase, who claim that the company did not give back what it took from the Haiku project and other open source BeOS projects. In many cases, open source programmers have recreated yellowTAB&#x27;s extensions to BeOS, most notably their SVG graphics extensions to OpenTracker. However, yellowTAB&#x27;s actions to date have not violated the BSD/MIT licences under which most open source BeOS projects exist.

In March 2006, yellowTAB donated their &quot;Intel Extreme&quot; driver to one of the Haiku developers for integration into the Haiku source tree where further development was to take place. Both yellowTAB and Haiku developers were to collaborate on Intel Extreme Graphics driver development, but to date this code has not yet been committed to the repository.

In April 2006, insolvency protection proceedings were filed for the company, although employees denied that it was actually filed by the company, suggesting potential malicious intent. However, the firm has transferred development and support of ZETA to a third-party, magnussoft.

<doc id="1049662" wikidata="Q710071" url="?curid=1049662" title="Filipe Neri Ferrão">
<text>Filipe Neri António Sebastião do Rosário Ferrão (born 20 January 1953) is an Indian Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Goa and Daman since 2004. He was previously an auxiliary bishop of the same archdiocese from 1993 to 2004. Ferrão was created a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022. 

Ferrão is the sixth prelate of Goan origin to attain the rank of cardinal and the first Archbishop of Goa and Daman to be a cardinal since an episcopal see was established there in 1557.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Ferrão was born on 20 January 1953 in Mapusa, Goa, to Agostinho Lourenço Tomé Ferrão and Maria Palmira Eugênia Gertrudes da Conceição Nazaré; he is the youngest of their three children. After completing the Preparatory Course at the Minor Seminary of Our Lady, Saligao-Pilerne, Goa, he went to study philosophy and theology at the Papal Seminary, Pune. Ferrão was ordained a priest on 28 October 1979. His pastoral assignments were: Parochial Vicar at Salvador do Mundo in 1979 and in Chinchinim from 1981 to 1984; Prefect of Discipline at the Minor Seminary of Our Lady, Saligão-Pilerne, from 1984 to 1986, where he was also Director of the Vocation Commission for Diocesan Clergy.

Ferrão then studied at the Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, obtaining a licentiate degree in Biblical Theology in 1988, and then in Brussels at the International Institute &quot;Lumen Vitae&quot;, earning a licentiate degree in catechetics and pastoral theology in 1991.

Returning to Goa, he was the first director of the Diocesan Centre for Lay Apostolate from 1991 to 1994. There he launched the publication of booklets of daily scriptural reflections for the faithful: &quot;Daily Flash&quot; and &quot;Jivitacho Prokas&quot;. His other assignments included Convenor of the Team for Transfers of Priests from 1992 to 1997; Ecclesiastical Advisor to St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Guild, Goa, from 1992 to 1994, and Episcopal Vicar for the North Zone of the Archdiocese, from 1993 to 1994.

He is fluent in Konkani, English, Portuguese, Italian, French and German.

=== Bishop and archbishop ===
Pope John Paul II appointed him auxiliary bishop of Goa and Daman and titular bishop of Vanariona on 25 January 1994. He received his episcopal consecration on 10 April 1994 from Archbishop Raul Nicolau Gonçalves in the Se Cathedral in Old Goa, with bishops Aleixo das Neves Dias and Ferdinand Joseph Fonseca as co-consecrators.

On 16 January 2004, Pope John Paul named him Archbishop of Goa and Daman with the honorary title of Patriarch of the East Indies. He was installed as archbishop on 21 March 2004.

On 25 November 2006, the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman was reorganized as a metropolitan archdiocese with a suffragan diocese and no longer directly subject to the Holy See. Pope Benedict XVI named Ferrão its first archbishop.

===Cardinal===
On 29 May 2022, Pope Francis announced that he planned to make Ferrão a cardinal. On 27 August 2022, Pope Francis made him a cardinal priest, assigning him the title of Santa Maria in Via.

In February 2024, Ferrão was elected President of the Federation of Asian Bishops&#x27; Conferences replacing Cardinal Charles Maung Bo of Yangon, Myanmar.

On 23 October 2024, the Synod of Bishops elected Ferrão a member of the Ordinary Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod.

<doc id="1049665" wikidata="Q4975027" url="?curid=1049665" title="Brooks Locomotive Works">
<text>The Brooks Locomotive Works manufactured railroad steam locomotives and freight cars from 1869 through its merger into the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1901.

==History==
When the New York and Erie Railroad (NY&amp;E) relocated its shops facilities from Dunkirk, New York, to Buffalo in 1869, Dunkirk lost its largest employer. Coming to the city&#x27;s rescue was Horatio G. Brooks (1828–1887), the former chief engineer of the NY&amp;E who was at the controls of the first train into Dunkirk in 1851. In 1869, Brooks leased the Dunkirk shops facility from the NY&amp;E and formed the Brooks Locomotive Works. The new company officially opened on November 13, 1869. The company&#x27;s first steam locomotive was completed the following month as part of an order for the NY&amp;E, the company&#x27;s first customer.
Within a couple of years of its opening, Brooks was producing as many as seven new locomotives per month, compared to one per month while the facility was controlled by the NY&amp;E. Brooks built locomotives for nearly all of the major railroads of the time, producing 37 new locomotives in its first year and 43 new locomotives in its second year of operations.

After the financial crisis of 1873, orders for new equipment dropped off, but Brooks was able to recover enough business to avoid bankruptcy. Brooks locomotives were displayed a few years later at the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in Chicago, where they were judged the Best in Show. Brooks locomotives were also favorably received and awarded at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893.
The 1890s brought another period of depressed sales following another financial crisis. The company produced 226 new locomotives in 1891, but only 90 new locomotives in 1894. The company briefly gained some positive publicity in 1895 when one of its locomotives held the land speed record for rail vehicles; a Brooks-built locomotive was driven at on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway on October 24, 1895. Brooks also gained positive publicity for building some exceptionally large locomotives at the end of the 19th century, including locomotives for both Great Northern Railway and Illinois Central Railroad that were hailed as being the largest in the world. However Brooks was not able to recover business as easily as the previous downturn and, following brief participation in a widespread strike by machinists in May, the company was merged with several other manufacturers in 1901 to form the American Locomotive Company. The last Brooks locomotive, serial number 3883, built for the Lake Shore Railroad, was completed on June 22, 1901.
Horatio Brooks died in April 1887; he was succeeded as president of the company by his son-in-law, Edward Nichols. Nichols died on January 7, 1892, and was succeeded by then vice president Marshall L. Hinman. Hinman resigned from the presidency in December 1896 to be succeeded by another of H.G. Brooks&#x27;s sons-in-law, Frederick H. Stevens. Stevens led the company until the merger with Alco in 1901.

Following the merger, the Brooks plant built one of the first orders booked by ALCO, consisting of fifteen 2-8-0 locomotives for Mexican Central Railroad. ALCO produced locomotives at this facility until 1934 when the shop was renamed ALCO Thermal Products Division. Locomotives produced at the former Brooks plant after ALCO&#x27;s formation came to be known as ALCO-Brooks locomotives.

Although new locomotives were no longer being produced at the former Brooks shops in Dunkirk, shop forces were kept busy for some time building spare parts for ALCO locomotives. Production had shifted from locomotives to heat exchangers, high-pressure vessels and pipes of all sizes.

After World War II, production at the Dunkirk plant never got back to its prewar levels. ALCO finally closed the facility in 1962.

==Timeline==
* November 11, 1869: Horatio Brooks leases the shops facility in Dunkirk and officially opens the Brooks Locomotive Works
* 1883: Brooks locomotives are named the Best in Show locomotives at the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in Chicago.
* February 22, 1884: Brooks completes its 1,000th new locomotive.
* November 30, 1891: Brooks completes its 2,000th new locomotive.
* July 23, 1898: Brooks completes its 3,000th new locomotive.
* 1901: Brooks and several other locomotive manufacturers are merged into the American Locomotive Company
* 1934: New locomotive construction at the Brooks plant ends as the plant is renamed ALCO Thermal Products Division.
* 1962: ALCO closes the former Brooks plant in Dunkirk, laying off the remaining 750 laborers at the facility.

==Preserved Brooks locomotives==
Brooks Locomotive Works sold locomotives to all of the major railroads of the late 19th century. Following is a partial list (in serial number order) of Brooks-built locomotives that have been spared the scrapper&#x27;s torch.

<text>ZETA, earlier yellowTAB ZETA, was an operating system formerly developed by yellowTAB of Germany based on the Be Operating System developed by Be Inc.; because of yellowTAB&#x27;s insolvency, ZETA was later being developed by an independent team of which little was known, and distributed by magnussoft. As of February 28, 2007 the current and last version of ZETA was 1.5. 

On March 28, 2007, magnussoft announced that it has discontinued funding the development of ZETA by March 16, because the sales figures had fallen far short of the company&#x27;s expectations, so that the project was no longer economically viable. A few days later, the company also stopped the distribution of ZETA in reaction to allegations that ZETA constituted an illegal unlicensed derivative of the BeOS source code and binaries.

== Development ==
ZETA was an effort to bring BeOS up to date, adding support for newer hardware, and features that had been introduced in other operating systems in the years since Be Incorporated ceased development in 2001. Among the new features were USB 2.0 support, SATA support, samba support, a new media player, and enhanced localization of system components. Unlike Haiku and other open source efforts to recreate some or all of BeOS&#x27;s functionality from scratch, ZETA was based on the actual BeOS code base, and it is closed source.

ZETA contributed to an increase in activity in the BeOS commercial software market, with a number of new products for both ZETA and the earlier BeOS being released.

However, some critics point to a list of goals for the first release that do not appear to have been met (including Java 1.4.2 and ODBC support). Other reviewers point to bugs that still exist from BeOS, and question whether yellowTAB has the complete access to the source code they would need to make significant updates.

Some changes that were made could break compilation of code, and in some cases (most notably Mozilla), break the actual application if any code optimizations are applied, resulting in much slower builds.

YellowTAB promoted ZETA mainly in the German market, where it used to be sold through infomercials and on RTL Shop, and in Japan still being a beta version. Prior to Magnussoft stopping the distribution of ZETA, it was mainly distributed directly by magnussoft.

== Versions ==
== Criticism ==

ZETA and yellowTAB have been surrounded by controversy. Critics of yellowTAB questioned for a long time the legality of ZETA, and whether yellowTAB had legal access to the sources of BeOS; it is now known that yellowTAB could not have developed ZETA to the extent that they did without access to the source code, but doubts remain as to whether yellowTAB actually had legal access to the code or not.

Furthermore, critics did not see ZETA as real advancement of BeOS, but rather as an unfinished and buggy operating system loaded with third party applications that were either obsolete, unsupported, or non-functional. This was particularly true in the initial releases of ZETA, and it was in clear conflict with the attention to detail that BeOS used to stand for, disappointing the BeOS community who at one point had high expectations for ZETA. While yellowTAB did clean up the selection of bundled applications in following versions, ZETA remains somewhat unstable when compared to other modern desktop operating systems.

But perhaps the most criticized practice by yellowTAB was its tendency to make claims that turned out to be either half truths or vague enough that they could not be confirmed. Not only did yellowTAB announce certain developments that never materialized (such as Java, and ODBC among others), but it would also support certain capabilities beyond what ZETA was actually capable of (e.g., compatibility with MS Office). According to sources close to yellowTAB, this is believed to have led to a high return rate from customers that bought ZETA from the German RTL TV shopping channel, and the reason for which RTL eventually stopped selling the product.

There was some criticism within the greater BeOS community regarding the lack of a &quot;personal&quot; edition of Zeta. This is a somewhat controversial standpoint, given the history of BeOS and Be Inc. Throughout the life of the Intel version of BeOS, Be Inc regularly created and distributed BeOS demo discs on CD. The discs were somewhat crippled and would not mount a BFS partition nor would they install to a physical hard drive. They served as a test for hardware support and a taster for the operating system. Zeta was offered in a similar way – demo discs with similar limitations were made available. Unfortunately, many in the BeOS community, especially those who came to BeOS post the demise of Be Inc, tended to have an issue with the &quot;crippled&quot; demo discs. The controversy is as follows: the final commercial release of BeOS, Revision 5, included a freely distributable &quot;virtual&quot; BeOS installation. The installer created a virtual BeOS image in a file on the host OS, and the computer could then boot into BeOS using a boot disk or via the installation of Bootman (the native BeOS boot manager.) Be Inc intended this release to be a taster and to draw users into buying the Professional edition, which was fully installable to a physical hard drive partition. Unfortunately, many users discovered that it was a trivial task to install the personal version to a real partition, and so Be Inc ultimately lost much of the sales potential for the product. Both YellowTab and Magnussoft learnt from this, and therefore did not offer a version of Zeta that could be installed without purchasing a license.

German language – the Zeta initial builds and much of the packaging was geared towards a German-speaking audience. This was reduced in later versions, but the first few beta releases and release candidates had many oddities where Zeta would fall back to German, no matter what locale was set.

Version 1.0 of Zeta included a badly thought out activation component, which requires a code to be entered and authenticated via a remote server before the nag screen will stop and full functionality is restored. The nag is fairly easily circumvented by replacing the executable called with a stub executable, but the activation was incredibly poorly executed and often failed. The activation was removed by the 1.21 release.

== Cease of distribution ==
A cease of distribution letter was posted by Magnussoft on 5 April 2007.

<doc id="1049668" wikidata="Q1752134" url="?curid=1049668" title="Net national income">
<text>In national income accounting, net national income (NNI) is net national product (NNP) minus indirect taxes. Net national income encompasses the income of households, businesses, and the government. Net national income is defined as gross domestic product plus net receipts of wages, salaries and property income from abroad, minus the depreciation of fixed capital assets (dwellings, buildings, machinery, transport equipment and physical infrastructure) through wear and tear and obsolescence.

It can be expressed as

formula_1

where denotes consumption, denotes investment, denotes government spending, and represents net exports (exports minus imports: ).

This formula uses the expenditure method of national income accounting.

When net national income is adjusted for natural resource depletion, it is called &quot;Adjusted Net National Income&quot;, expressed as

formula_2

Natural resources are non-critical natural capital such as minerals. NNI* does not take critical natural capital into account. Examples are air, water, land, etc.

For reference, capital (K) is divided into four categories: 
*formula_3 : manufactured capital (machines, factories, etc.)
*formula_4 : human capital (workers&#x27; skills)
*formula_5 : non-critical natural capital (minerals)
*formula_6 : critical natural capital (air, water)

<doc id="1049682" wikidata="Q2376046" url="?curid=1049682" title="Berwick Bassett">
<text>Berwick Bassett is a small village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, about northwest of Marlborough and southwest of Swindon. The village is on the west bank of a headstream of the River Kennet and close to the A4361 road, formerly the A361, which links Devizes and Avebury with Wroughton and Swindon.

==Geography==
The parish of Berwick Bassett is part of Calne Hundred and comprises about 1400 acres about north of Avebury. It has a slender rectangular shape, oriented east and west, and is crossed from north to south by the upper part of the River Kennet, which flows only in the winter months. The village of Berwick Basset lies to the west of the stream and has a small village green close to the bridge, around which are clustered the Manor, Home Farm and Berwick House Farm.

==History==
There are a number of ancient sites in the parish; these include flint tools, Romano-British pottery fragments, cropmarks, enclosures, a round barrow and a medieval farmstead. The ancient trackway known as the Ridgeway forms the eastern boundary of the parish.

Berwick was not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 and was probably part of the king&#x27;s Calne estate. The Bassett suffix arose after the manor was granted in 1206 to Alan Basset. He was succeeded by three of his sons in turn: Gilbert, Fulk (who went on to become Bishop of London), and Philip (Chief Justiciar). The Wiltshire Victoria County History recounts the later landowners.

Manor Farmhouse or Old Manor House, next to the church, is from the late 15th century or early 16th. The newer Manor House, near the stream, is from the early 17th.

The population of the parish peaked at 203 at the time of the 1851 census. A National school was built near the church in 1847 and was in use until 1922.

==Local government==
Berwick Bassett is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. It elects a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of Winterbourne Monkton.

==Church==
St Nicholas&#x27;s Church dates from the early 13th century. Having been declared redundant in 1972, the Grade II* listed building is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The parish of Winterbourne Monkton with Berwick Bassett is part of the Upper Kennet benefice.

<text>Gil Eanes (or Eannes, in the old Portuguese spelling; ) was a 15th-century Portuguese navigator and explorer.

==Biography==
Gil Eanes was born in Lagos in 1395. Little is known about his personal life prior to his role in the Portuguese Age of Discovery, and was considered a household servant and shield-bearer of the Infante Henry the Navigator. He was a native of Lagos on which he based his sea voyages, in the southern Algarve. 
He joined the service of Prince Henry&#x27;s expeditions in 1433, when the Infante entrusted him with a vessel and crew, in order to attempt to round Cape Bojador, a cape impassable with their level of knowledge and equipment. Sailing from Lagos, Portugal, Eanes made an unknown number of voyages along the west coast of Africa, before being driven west towards the Canary Islands. In the islands he captured some natives and returned with them as captives to Sagres, excusing his failure by recounting the dangers of the trip. His return was greeted with reserve and coldness in the court of Prince Henry, who had expected the navigator to succeed in rounding the Cape. Eanes hoped to return to favour in the following year, if the Prince would favour him with a second expedition. In 1434, his barquentine-caravel and crew was able to sail beyond Cape Bojador and return to Sagres via a volta do mar, reporting the conditions of the water, land and ease of navigation beyond the Cape, and bringing with him some wild roses to prove that they had succeeded in their expedition. The discovery of a passable route around Cape Bojador marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of Africa. 

Eanes made another voyage, with Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia, in 1435. They sailed about 30 leagues (144 km), or even 50 leagues (240 km) south of Cape Bojador and reached the African coast. Although they did not discover any inhabitants immediately, they did find traces of a human presence, during a voyage that was considered favourable. They named the bay in which they anchored &quot;Angra dos Ruivos&quot; (&quot;Cove of Reds&quot;), for the abundance of fish (resembling gurnets) that they caught in the waters.

==Namesakes==
A city square is named in his native city of Lagos, Portugal.

An old lyceum in Mindelo on the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde, was named for him. In the 1930s, it had the best education on the island and the archipelago. Today it is known as Escola Jorge Barbosa, and forms a campus of the University of Cape Verde.

A Portuguese Navy ship built in 1955 was named after him.

<text>The BMW M6 is a high-performance version of the 6 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand from 1983 to 2019 (with a hiatus from 1990 to 2004).

Introduced in the coupe body style, the M6 was also built in convertible and fastback sedan (&#x27;Gran Coupe&#x27;) body styles for later generations. An M6 model was built for each of the first three generations of the 6 Series. Production of the M6 ended in 2019 and it was replaced by the BMW M8 (F91/F92/F93) in 2019.


==E24 M635CSi/M6 (1983–1989)==
The M6 lineage began in 1983 with the &quot;M635CSi&quot; model of the E24 6 Series range, which was powered by the M88/3 DOHC straight-six engine (which was a modified version of the engine used in the BMW M1 supercar). In most countries, the model was badged the M635CSi, however the equivalent model in North America and Japan was simply badged in &quot;M6&quot;.

The European-specification M635CSi used the M88/3 engine (without a catalytic converter), which generated at 6,500 rpm and at 4,500 rpm. The M6 version, sold in North America and Japan, used the S38B35 engine (with catalytic converter), which generated and at the same engine speeds. The catalyzed engine was also used in European and other market cars beginning in the summer of 1987, with identical specifications to the federalized engine. The sole transmission for all models was a 5-speed Getrag 280 manual transmission.

Other changes included BBS RS wheels, a rear lip spoiler, a larger front air dam, larger front brakes and revised suspension with a lower ride height.

The E24 series became a &quot;world car&quot; for the 1988 and 1989 model years, sporting the same bumpers and aerodynamic treatments as its high-performance counterparts across all markets.

According to BMW, the car can accelerate from in 5.8 and 6.8 seconds for the European and North American versions respectively. The curb weights of the 1987 models are for the M635 CSi and for the M6. A top speed of made the European M635CSi the second fastest BMW automobile ever built next to the M1. The quarter mile time for the M635 CSi has been recorded at 14.5 seconds while is achieved in 15 seconds.

A total of 5,855 cars were produced. Of these, 1,677 cars were imported to North America. Due to the elongated front and rear bumpers, the length of the U.S. models is .

Production of the E24 M635CSi/M6 ended in 1989.
== E63/64 M6 (2005–2011) ==

Following a hiatus in M6 production for 16 years, the M6 version of the E63/E64 6 Series was introduced in 2005. The M6 uses the same BMW S85 V10 engine and SMG-III automated manual gearbox as the E60 M5.

The M6 was produced as both a coupé (E63 model code) and a convertible (E64 model code). The exterior styling was overseen by Karl Elmitt.

The M6 had two modes for engine power: a &quot;P400&quot; mode in which the engine has a rated power output of and a &quot;P500&quot; mode in which the engine has a rated power output of . Manufacturer claimed performance included a 0– acceleration time of 4.6 seconds. The top speed was electronically limited to or if the optional M-driver&#x27;s package is fitted.

The coupe version weighs , and the convertible version weighs . Weight reduction measures include a (coupe-only) carbon fibre roof (a first for regular production model last used on E46 M3 CSL), thermoplastic quarter panels, aluminium doors, aluminium bonnet (hood) and a thermo-fibre plastic boot (trunk) lid.

From 2007 a 6-speed manual gearbox was offered in North America, only 701 examples were produced with a manual gearbox (323 Coupes and 378 Convertibles).

Production of the M6 ended in 2011, with sales over the five-year run totalling 9,087 for the coupe and 5,065 for the convertible.

=== Competition Package ===

From 2009 a Competition Package is offered including front and rear suspension dropped by 12mm and 10mm respectively using wider rims mounting Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres. ABS, stability control and M Differential settings have been optimised to improve cornering. From outside the Competition Package is recognised because of its new bonnet with ‘precision lines’ as well as because of the redesigned wheels.

=== Competition Special Edition ===

In 2009 and simultaneously presented with the Competition Package, a special edition of only 100 units was announced. All of the 100 units receive the name BMW M6 Competition and include the Competition Package, plus a special matte painting for the exterior named &#x27;Frozen Gray Metallic&#x27;. The interior uses a special trim of Merino leather in either light gray two-tone finish with contrasting stitching or black. All cars included custom floor mats with ‘M6 Competition’ labelling.

== F06/F12/F13 M6 (2012–2019) ==

The new model is based on the F12/F13/F06 6 Series, and shares its 7-speed dual clutch (&quot;M-DCT&quot;) transmission and BMW S63 twin-turbo V8 engine with the F10 M5.

The official performance figures state the acceleration time from in 4.2 seconds for the coupe and Gran Coupé, and 4.3 seconds for the convertible. The top speed is electronically limited to , or with the optional M-driver&#x27;s package. The differential is an electronically actuated (&quot;Active M&quot;) limited slip differential. The curb weight for the coupe is . The curb weight of the convertible is , and the curb weight of the Gran Coupé is .

The front of the car has a newly designed M kidney grille with an “M6” badge – a homage to the first generation of the M6. The lead exterior designer of the F12/F13/F06 6 Series was Nader Faghihzadeh.

M Performance Parts can be fitted to all M6 models. These include black kidney grilles, a sport exhaust system that reduces weight, a carbon fibre diffuser, a carbon fibre spoiler, a carbon fibre sport steering wheel and a carbon fibre gear selector.

=== Competition Package ===
With the 2014 Competition Package, the M6 comes with a sportier exhaust system with black tips, stiffer springs, dampers, and anti-roll bars, steering is more direct than the base M6, the twin-turbocharged V8 engine utilised in the M6 is updated and is rated at and of torque. This results in a 0 to acceleration time of 3.9 seconds for the coupe and Gran Coupe versions.

In 2016, the Competition Pack engine was upgraded to and of torque, resulting in a 0 to acceleration time of 3.8 seconds for the coupe and Gran Coupe versions.
===Motorsport===
====M6 GT3====

Around the start of 2015, BMW Motorsport began developing a replacement for the successful BMW Z4 GT3 which already had been in action since 2010, where they selected the M6 as the base model. Throughout the year, the factory engineered the M6 to match FIA GT3 specifications. Emphasis was placed on safety with BMW Motorsport producing an &quot;FIA-approved safety cell in accordance with the very latest safety standards&quot;. Unlike the Z4 GT3, which used an engine derived from the BMW M3, the engine of the M6 GT3 was virtually unchanged from that of the production model of the M6 (and the BMW M5). The engine only faced some modifications for use in motorsport. In May 2015, at Dingolfing, BMW works driver Jörg Müller drove the M6 GT3 on its first roll-out to contribute a milestone to its development, and later the M6 GT3 was revealed near the end of the year.

The M6 GT3 showed its success on its debut year in 2016 when Rowe Racing clinched overall victory at the 2016 24 Hours of Spa with BMW works drivers Philipp Eng, Maxime Martin, and Alexander Sims at the wheel. The car also saw success in championships around the world, with wins in the VLN, Italian GT Championship, and Super GT Championship.

====M6 GTLM====
The BMW M6 GTLM is the racing version of the M6 created to participate in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and intended to replace the BMW Z4 GTE. The cars are entered by BMW Team RLL, debuting in 2016, with no wins in its debut season. The car would earn four class wins during the 2017 season before being replaced by the BMW M8 GTE for 2018.

<doc id="1049691" wikidata="Q7452470" url="?curid=1049691" title="Sequence logo">
<text>In bioinformatics, a sequence logo is a graphical representation of the sequence conservation of nucleotides (in a strand of DNA/RNA) or amino acids (in protein sequences).
A sequence logo is created from a collection of aligned sequences and depicts the consensus sequence and diversity of the sequences.
Sequence logos are frequently used to depict sequence characteristics such as protein-binding sites in DNA or functional units in proteins.

==Overview==
A sequence logo consists of a stack of letters at each position. 
The relative sizes of the letters indicate their frequency in the sequences. 
The total height of the letters depicts the information content of the position, in bits.

==Logo creation==
To create sequence logos, related DNA, RNA or protein sequences, or DNA sequences that have common conserved binding sites, are aligned so that the most conserved parts create good alignments. A sequence logo can then be created from the conserved multiple sequence alignment. The sequence logo will show how well residues are conserved at each position: the higher the number of residues, the higher the letters will be, because the better the conservation is at that position. Different residues at the same position are scaled according to their frequency. The height of the entire stack of residues is the information measured in bits. Sequence logos can be used to represent conserved DNA binding sites, where transcription factors bind.

The information content (y-axis) of position formula_1 is given by:
:for amino acids, formula_2
:for nucleic acids, formula_3

where formula_4 is the uncertainty
(sometimes called the Shannon entropy) of position formula_1
:formula_6

Here, formula_7 is the relative frequency of base or amino acid formula_8 at position formula_1, and formula_10 is the small-sample correction for an alignment of formula_11 letters. The height of letter formula_8 in column formula_1 is given by
:formula_14

The approximation for the small-sample correction, formula_10, is given by:
:formula_16

where formula_17 is 4 for nucleotides, 20 for amino acids, and formula_11 is the number of sequences in the alignment.

==Consensus logo==

A consensus logo is a simplified variation of a sequence logo that can be embedded in text format.
Like a sequence logo, a consensus logo is created from a collection of aligned protein or DNA/RNA sequences and conveys information about the conservation of each position of a sequence motif or sequence alignment
. However, a consensus logo displays only conservation information, and not explicitly the frequency information of each nucleotide or amino acid at each position. Instead of a stack made of several characters, denoting the relative frequency of each character, the consensus logo depicts the degree of conservation of each position using the height of the consensus character at that position.


===Advantages and drawbacks===
The main, and obvious, advantage of consensus logos over sequence logos is their ability to be embedded as text in any Rich Text Format supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between sequence logos and consensus sequences. As a result, compared to a sequence logo, the consensus logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include graphic figures in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use of consensus sequences in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency. Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over consensus sequences whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.

==Extensions==
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) not only consider the information content of aligned positions in an alignment, but also of insertions and deletions. In an HMM sequence logo used by Pfam, three rows are added to indicate the frequencies of occupancy (presence) and insertion, as well as the expected insertion length.

<doc id="1049694" wikidata="Q618975" url="?curid=1049694" title="Apollo (crater)">
<text>Apollo, also called the Apollo basin, is a large impact crater located on the far side of the Moon, in the southern hemisphere. It was previously known as Basin XVI; in 1970 it was officially named after the Apollo missions by the International Astronomical Union.

The Chang&#x27;e 6 spacecraft landed within Apollo basin in 2024, collected samples of the surface, then brought them to Earth for analysis.

== Geology ==

Apollo is a double-ringed walled plain (or basin) whose inner ring is roughly half the diameter of the outer wall. Both the outer wall and the interior have been heavily worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, so that significant parts of the outer and inner walls now consist of irregular and incised sections of mountainous arcs. The interior floor is covered in a multitude of craters of various sizes, some of which have been named for people associated with the Apollo program or other NASA projects.

Sections of Apollo&#x27;s interior have been resurfaced with lava, leaving patches of the floor with a lower albedo than the surroundings. There is a large patch of this lunar mare in the middle part of the inner ring, which contains some ray system markings. A long stretch of the mare lies along the southern part of the crater. There is also a smaller section near the western rim.

==Interior craters==

Three craters are named after the crew of Apollo 8. In the southeast part of Apollo is Borman crater, named after commander Frank Borman. Near the southeastern margin of Apollo is Anders crater, named after William Anders. On the eastern margin is Lovell crater, named after Jim Lovell.

Many craters within and adjacent to the Apollo impact have been named to honor deceased NASA employees.

Dryden is attached to the west-northwestern exterior of the inner ring. Chaffee is a similar-sized crater that lies partly across the southwest section of the inner ring. Inside the inner ring are the craters Resnik, McAuliffe and Onizuka, and the Jarvis–McNair crater pair. The crater Smith lies across the northern part of the inner ring.

In 2006 the IAU approved a proposal to name seven interior craters to honor the astronauts killed in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.


Three of the crater names include the respective astronaut&#x27;s first initials to distinguish them from the existing craters called Anderson, Brown and Clark.

==Robotic exploration==
China launched the Chang&#x27;e 6 robotic mission on 3 May 2024, which seeks to return the first lunar sample from the Apollo Basin on the far side of the Moon. This is China&#x27;s second lunar sample return mission, the first was the Chang&#x27;e 5 mission that returned lunar samples from the near side of the Moon four years earlier. The Chang&#x27;e 6 lander also carried a rover named &quot;Jinchan&quot; which conducted infrared spectroscopy of the landing site and imaged the Chang&#x27;e 6 lander on the lunar surface. The lander-ascender-rover combination separated from the orbiter and returner before landing in the southern mare of the Apollo basin on 1 June 2024 at 22:23 UTC; its precise landing location is near lunar coordinates After the probe collected far-side regolith samples and placed it on the ascender, the latter probe segment launched back into lunar orbit on 3 June 2024 at 23:38 UTC. The ascender docked with the Chang&#x27;e 6 service module (the orbiter) in lunar orbit at 06:48 UTC on 6 June 2024 and subsequently completed the transfer of the sample container to the Earth return module at 07:24 UTC on the same day. The orbiter left lunar orbit on 20 June 2024 with the atmospheric re-entry module that landed in Inner Mongolia with the collected samples on 25 June 2024.

==Nearby features==
The crater Oppenheimer is located next to Apollo&#x27;s western rim, and the crater Barringer lies across the northern wall. To the southeast is the crater Anders, and Kleymenov is just to the east of the rim.

<doc id="1049702" wikidata="Q5059536" url="?curid=1049702" title="Center for Cartoon Studies">
<text>The Center for Cartoon Studies (CCS) is a two-year institution focusing on sequential art, specifically comics and graphic novels. It is located in the village of White River Junction within the town of Hartford, Vermont. The Center offers a Master of Fine Arts degree, both one and two-year certificate programs, and summer programs. It is &quot;the only college-level training program of its kind in the United States.&quot;

== History ==
The Center for Cartoon Studies was founded by cartoonist James Sturm and professor Michelle Ollie in 2004, with its first class of 18 students in the Fall of 2005. The first class of students were accepted less on the quality of their drawing and more on their critical thinking skills, literary merit, storytelling abilities, and curiosity.

The Center&#x27;s first commencement took place on May 19, 2007, with roughly 20 students graduating. In 2007 CCS was approved by the State of Vermont to award Master of Fine Arts degrees and certificates, which have been awarded to students from all subsequent classes. It currently has a student body of 48 students with an average age of 24. About 20 new students are accepted each year.

The school educates students to be proficient in all aspects of graphic design and production, including self-publication and promotion. This is a notable step away from the specialized production model of mainstream comics companies such as Marvel Comics and DC Comics, wherein writing, pencilwork, inking, coloring, and lettering are most often handled by separate individuals. This inclination is in part due to many of the faculty&#x27;s and significant donor Peter Laird&#x27;s experience with alternative comics. The State of Vermont Department of Education approved CCS for degree granting authority and the school is also a member of Vermont Higher Education Council.

== Campus ==

The Center for Cartoon Studies currently operates out of two buildings in the historic district of White River Junction, Vermont. The school rents space in the former Colodny’s Surprise Department Store Building, and in December 2011 the school purchased a former Post Office a few buildings down from Department Store Building. The school&#x27;s Schulz Library used to be housed in a former fire station on Bridge Street, a building also occupied by the Main Street Museum, but had to be evacuated in August 2011 due to flood waters from Hurricane Irene.

=== Colodny’s Surprise Department Store ===
All the main operational and educational facilities of the Center for Cartoon Studies are located in the former Colodny’s Surprise Department Store Building. Built in 1929, the building is the only Art Deco building in downtown White River Junction, and is built partially with Antique Verde marble quarried from Rochester, Vermont. CCS inhabits the first floor and basement of the building and includes multiple offices, a classroom, and an &quot;open basement studio.&quot;

=== Post Office ===
The Former Post office Building in downtown White River Junction was purchased by the school in December 2011. The brick building was constructed in a colonial revival architectural style and was built in 1934 as a Works Progress Administration structure. This building will become the main structure for the Center for Cartoon Studies and includes classrooms, faculty offices and lounges, and the Schulz Library. The top floor of the Post Office Building is still rented to the current tenants. It also includes studio space for the Inky Solomon Center, a grant-program geared towards CCS alumni, their comics, and community outreach.

== Schulz Library ==

The Schulz Library, named after Charles M. Schulz, is the official library of the Center for Cartoon Studies and currently houses over 20,000 titles. The Library&#x27;s collection focuses on comic books, graphic novels, as well as &quot;books about cartooning – both academic and instructional.&quot; The Schulz&#x27;s collection has grown largely from donations from collectors and publishers, as well as artists.

Special collections located at the Library include a large collection of rare and hard-to-find &quot;Peanuts&quot; books (by the library&#x27;s namesake Charles M. Schulz), collections of gag cartoons, classic newspaper comic strips, zines and minicomics, as well as &quot;a near-complete run of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;.&quot; Many hard-to-find titles and previews of student work are featured on the Schulz Library Blog.

The material in the library was previously housed in the former Bridge Street firehouse, owned by the Main Street Museum. It had to be evacuated in August 2011 due to flood waters from Hurricane Irene. In 2012 the Schulz library was moved to the Post Office Building the CCS purchased in 2011.

== Academics ==
The Center for Cartoon Studies offers a Master of Fine Arts degree, both one and two-year certificate programs, as well as summer programs.

Each term, roughly 14 well-known cartoon artists and others in the field come to CCS as visiting faculty and guest lecturers. The visiting faculty lecture, critique, and discuss with students of the school the student work and their own. Past visiting faculty have included Alison Bechdel, Ed Brubaker, Ivan Brunetti, James Kochalka, Jason Lutes, Scott McCloud, Seth, Art Spiegelman, Craig Thompson, and Chris Ware.

A senior thesis is required at the Center, which usually involves the creation of a full-scale graphic novel or a full year&#x27;s worth of work.

<doc id="1049706" wikidata="Q4463774" url="?curid=1049706" title="Bishops Cannings">
<text>Bishops Cannings is a village and civil parish in the Vale of Pewsey in Wiltshire, England, north-east of Devizes. The parish includes the village of Coate (not to be confused with Coate, Swindon) and the hamlets of Bourton, Horton and Little Horton.

== Geography ==
Etchilhampton Water, a minor tributary of the Salisbury Avon, rises from streams in the parish and flows south past Etchilhampton to Patney. The northern part of the parish lies on the Marlborough Downs, including Morgan&#x27;s Hill and part of Roundway Hill.

Bishops Cannings village is about south of the A361 road which links Devizes with Avebury and Swindon.

==History==
Prehistoric remains include a long barrow called Kitchen Barrow on a slope in the north-east of the parish, and a square earthwork enclosure of uncertain date on Morgan&#x27;s Hill in the north-west. A section of the Wansdyke crosses the parish, west from Tan Hill to Morgan&#x27;s Hill. The manor of Cannings was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as held by the Bishop of Salisbury; there was a substantial population of 127 households, with six mills.

Horton is first attested in 1158. The place-name is a common one in England and derives from Old English &quot;horu&quot; &#x27;dirt&#x27; and &quot;tūn&quot; &#x27;settlement, farm, estate&#x27;, presumably meaning &#x27;farm on muddy soil&#x27;.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Bourton manor was an estate of the Ernle family. The manor included the hamlet of Easton but today the name survives only at Easton Farm and Easton Down.

In the 1660s the lease of the manor of Cannings was bought by Paul Methuen (d. 1667) of Bradford-on-Avon, reputedly the richest cloth merchant in England. His son John (c.1650–1706) was MP for Devizes, and simultaneously Lord Chancellor of Ireland and ambassador to Portugal. John&#x27;s son Paul (c.1672–1757) deputised for his father at Lisbon, sat for Devizes and Brackley (Northamptonshire), became a government minister and held offices in the royal household; he sold the estate in 1720.

The Wansdyke medieval earthwork crosses the north of parish. The Kennet and Avon Canal (opened in 1810) was built through the parish, passing between Bishops Cannings and Horton.

On the 27 May 1941, a Royal Air Force De Havilland Dragon Rapide (R5929) was operating a training flight out of RAF Yatesbury. The aircraft stalled at low altitude and crashed near the village, killing all seven on board.

== Boundaries ==
Bishops Cannings was anciently part of the hundred of Potterne and Cannings. The parish is now the third largest in Wiltshire, but was formerly larger, having lost a large area to the nearby town of Devizes in 1835 and to the new parish of Roundway in 1894.

Bishops Cannings parish had previously encircled Devizes to the north, east and south, and reached as far into the town as the Crammer, a large pond on the edge of the town centre. This may explain how Bishops Cannings comes to lay claim to being the place of origin of the legend of the Moonrakers. Next to the pond is the 15th-century church of St James, which was a chapelry of Bishops Cannings.

Further expansion of the borough of Devizes in 1934 brought Wick and the whole of St James&#x27;s chapelry (sometimes called Southbroom, and including Southbroom House) into the town, while the Nursteed tithing became part of Roundway. In 2017 Roundway became a ward of Devizes. A north-eastern part of the Devizes built-up area known as Northfields, between the canal and Horton Road and including retailers Lidl and B&amp;Q and the former Le Marchant Barracks, remains within Bishops Cannings parish.

==Local government==
Bishops Cannings is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for almost all significant local government functions.

==Religious sites==

=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is Grade I listed. Originating in the 12th or 13th century, with many Early English features surviving, it was altered in the 14th and 15th centuries and restored in the 19th. Pevsner writes that it has &quot;uncommon size and nobility&quot;, through being part of a bishop&#x27;s estate.

Domesday Book recorded a priest but did not mention a church. The earliest parts of the building are a damaged 12th-century scallop capital in the chancel, and one of the chancel&#x27;s west lancet windows which is from the late 12th century or early 13th. The three-bay chancel, mostly in rubble stone, is from the mid-13th century.

The church has a cruciform plan and is in ashlar apart from the chancel and sacristy. The large central tower carries a spire, and the four-bay nave (which originally had a higher roof) has aisles and a south porch. A lady chapel – since 1563 the Ernle family chapel – is attached to the east of the south transept. The porch has a round-headed 13th-century arch to the inner doorway, while the outer parts are 15th-century. There is an unusual two-storey sacristy at the north-east corner, in stone and flint; the ground floor is 13th-century and the upper floor perhaps 15th. The spire was added in the 15th century and around the same time the crossing and parts of the transepts were rebuilt. The nave had a clerestory from an early date, and this was rebuilt at greater height in the same century. The nave roof carries a date of 1670.

Restoration in the 19th century involved little major work. Orbach states that the Gothic stalls in the chancel are from T.H. Wyatt&#x27;s restoration in 1860, and gives the same year for the richly decorated east window by Wailes. The chapel was rebuilt in 1862–3, with a new east window. Further restoration by the Wiltshire architect C.E. Ponting in 1883–4 included re-roofing of the aisles and transepts, and renewal of the pews in that area, with carving by Harry Hems. Ponting&#x27;s description of the church, with drawings, was published in the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine in 1887.

Furnishings include a carrel desk (English Heritage) which Pevsner describes as a penitential seat and a &quot;great oddity&quot;; it is partly 15th-century. The octagonal font is late 15th-century. George Ferebee, vicar, arranged for an early organ to be installed around 1593, and in 1602 provided a peal of eight bells from the foundry of John Wallis. The present organ by George Pike England is from 1809. Four of Ferebee&#x27;s bells remain in the tower, the others being recast or replaced in 1840 or later. A 15th-century chest tomb in the churchyard is Grade II* listed.

In 1091, Bishop Osmond gave Cannings church and its considerable income to the new cathedral at Salisbury. The rectory manor, known as Cannings Canonicorum, remained in the ownership of the cathedral&#x27;s dean and chapter (but generally leased out) until they sold it at the beginning of the 19th century. The parish remained a peculiar until such jurisdictions were abolished in the 19th century. Today the parish comes under the Cannings and Redhorn Team Ministry, alongside seven others.

=== Others ===
The church of St James on the edge of Devizes (15th-century tower, rest rebuilt 1831–2) was a chapelry of St Mary&#x27;s, although it had its own graveyard by 1505. In 1832 a parish (a perpetual curacy) was created for it, covering the tithings of Bedborough, Nursteed, Roundway, and Wick. Boundary changes in 1835 brought the church inside the municipal borough.

The hamlet of Chittoe, some to the north-west near Bromham, was a detached part of Bishops Cannings parish until a church was built there in 1845.

A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was opened at Horton in 1832 and closed in the second half of the 20th century.

At Coate, a Brethren chapel was built in 1848 and closed in 1973.

== Amenities ==
Bishops Cannings has a primary school which serves the parish and the eastern side of Devizes. A National School was built in 1830 and transferred to the present site in 1907. The chapel at Coate was used as a school from 1848 until 1876, when a new school was opened nearby; this school closed in 1929.

The parish has four pubs: the Crown Inn at Bishops Cannings, the Bridge Inn near Horton, the New Inn at Coate, and the Hourglass at Devizes Marina on the Kennet and Avon Canal. Part of North Wilts Golf Club, on the downs, is within the parish, near the Morgan&#x27;s Hill Site of Special Scientific Interest.

== Notable people ==
* Around 1613 George Ferebee, vicar of Bishops Cannings, was appointed chaplain to King James I.
* William Bayly (1737–1810), the son of a Bishops Cannings farmer, was recognised for his mathematical prowess. He was employed by the Royal Observatory and sailed as an astronomer on two of Cook&#x27;s voyages. After completing his career as head-master of the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, in 1809 he paid for the organ in the parish church of his home village.

<doc id="1049708" wikidata="Q2858762" url="?curid=1049708" title="Appleton (crater)">
<text>Appleton is a heavily eroded lunar impact crater that lies in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. To the northwest are the craters Von Neumann and Campbel. The smaller Golovin lies to the northeast, while further to the southwest is the Mare Moscoviense.

The crater wall and interior have been heavily eroded by many subsequent impacts, leaving the features rounded and irregular. A pair of craters lie across the southwestern rim, and two small craters lie along the eastern rim. The interior floor is irregular.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Appleton was called &quot;Crater 129&quot;.

Appleton lies between satellite craters that are located on opposite sides of the rim. Appleton R is located just to the west-southwest, and contains another crater just inside its north rim. On the opposite side of Appleton is Appleton D, a comparably sized formation to Appleton R.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Appleton.

<text>Robin Weirauch ( ; born January 3, 1957) is an American politician of the Democratic party who was the party&#x27;s 2004 and 2006 nominee to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Paul Gillmor for the seat in Ohio&#x27;s 5th congressional district.

She is the daughter of a retired Master Staff Sergeant in the United States Air Force and has resided in the 5th District since her elementary school days and is married to her husband of 30 years, Bruce Weirauch, a retired Napoleon, Ohio police lieutenant.

Weirauch is a public administrator who formerly served as an Assistant Director at the Center For Regional Development at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. She holds an MPA in Public Administration from there and cites various other credentials as well.

Weirauch&#x27;s campaign team toured the geographically large district in a retired ambulance decorated with her, &quot;CPR - Caring Personal Representation&quot;, slogan.

Weirauch lost the 2006 election, receiving 43% of the vote. Gillmor was re-elected but died during the term, on September 5, 2007.

Prior to Gillmor&#x27;s death, Weirauch wrote several letters published in the Toledo Blade, criticizing Rep. Gillmor for supposedly living outside the district with only a token address within the district so that he could claim residency.

On September 20, 2007, Weirauch announced her candidacy for the vacant Fifth District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives with a video released on YouTube.com. She won the Democratic Primary on November 6, 2007 and faced Republican Bob Latta in the general election on December 11, 2007. She lost the election to the GOP candidate.

In 2008, she ran for Henry County Commissioner in the November election against Republican incumbent Bob Hastedt. Henry County, Ohio is a largely Republican leaning county (it voted for McCain over Obama by 1,900 votes), and Weirauch lost the election for commissioner by a large margin.

<doc id="1049711" wikidata="Q2528857" url="?curid=1049711" title="Rathgar">
<text>Rathgar () is a suburb of Dublin, Ireland. Originally a village, which from 1862 was part of the township of Rathmines and Rathgar, it was absorbed by the growing city and became a suburb in 1930. It lies about three kilometres south of the city centre.

==Location==
Rathgar is on the southside of Dublin, beside Dartry, Harold&#x27;s Cross, Rathmines and Terenure. Other nearby suburbs are Crumlin, Kimmage, Milltown, Ranelagh, and Rathfarnham. The Grand Canal flows to the north. The majority of the area lies within the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council and straddles the postal boundary of Dublin 6.

Rathgar is in the Dáil Éireann constituency of Dublin Bay South.

==History==

Rathgar in the Middle Ages was a farm belonging to the Convent of St Mary de Hogges, at present-day College Green. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Rathgar was granted to the Segrave family: they built Rathgar Castle, ownership of which subsequently passed to John Cusacke, who was Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1608. The castle remained in the possession of the Cusack family for over a century, but gradually decayed and was a ruin by the end of the eighteenth century. No trace of it remains today, though it is thought to have been located at present-day 44-49 Highfield Road.

In 1649 the Duke of Ormonde commander of the Anglo-Irish Royalist army established his camp at Rathgar during the Siege of Dublin. He was then routed at the Battle of Rathmines nearby by English Republican forces under Michael Jones.

The village began to develop in the eighteenth century. Rathgar Avenue may be the oldest street, while Highfield Road was developed in 1753. Zion Church and Christ Church Rathgar were built in the 1860s.

==Amenities==
Rathgar is a largely residential suburb with amenities that include primary and secondary schools, nursing homes, child-care and sports facilities, and public transport to the city centre. The housing stock largely comprises red-brick late Georgian and Victorian era terraces and much of the area lies within an architectural conservation zone. Dodder Park is located in Rathgar. Cowper and Milltown are the nearest rail connections, located on the Luas Green Line.

One of the main schools in the area is The High School, Dublin, which moved to the area from its original location on Harcourt Street in 1971. The High School follows a liberal Anglican heritage, but also has students of Jewish heritage.

<text>A fake orgasm occurs when a person pretends to have an orgasm without actually experiencing one. It usually involves simulating or acting out behaviors typically associated with orgasm, such as body movements, vocal sounds, and sequences of intensification followed by apparent release. It can also include giving verbal indications that orgasm occurred.

Both men and women can fake orgasm, but the inability to orgasm is not necessarily the fault of the sexual partner, as both psychological and physiological factors may lead to the inability to orgasm.

== Sex differences ==

While all genders fake orgasms, women fake orgasms more frequently than men. A survey of 180 male and 101 female college students (introductory psychology students from the University of Kansas), Muehlenhard &amp; Shippee (2009) found that 25% of men and 50% of women had pretended to orgasm (28% and 67%, respectively, for participants with experience in penile–vaginal intercourse (PVI)). Although most fake orgasms occurred during PVI, some participants also reported them during oral sex, manual sex, and phone sex. The ABC News 2004 &quot;American Sex Survey&quot;, a random-sample telephone poll of 1,501 Americans, showed that 48% of women and 11% of men faked orgasms. A 2012 joint survey of men&#x27;s lifestyle site AskMen and women&#x27;s lifestyle site TresSugar (now PopSugar) found that 34% of men and 54% of women had at some point faked an orgasm; 26% of women said they faked an orgasm every time they had sex. Other studies have found that anywhere from 25 to 74% of women admit to faking an orgasm at some point in their lives. This is more than the 25 percent of women who, according to &quot;Psychology Today&quot; in 2010, reported consistently having an orgasm during coitus. Women tend to achieve orgasm during intercourse less readily than men because most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, and not all sexual positions provide access to the clitoris, which can make orgasms difficult to achieve for women. For women in heterosexual relationships, faking an orgasm can also be rooted in deference to their partner, need for their approval, or feelings of shame or sexual inadequacy. As there appears to be &#x27;a sexual script in which women should orgasm before men, and men are responsible for women&#x27;s orgasms&#x27;, a woman may feel pressured to fake an orgasm before her partner in order to please them and avoid hurting their feelings.

Men fake orgasms for several reasons. Some fail to orgasm, but fake climax in order to avoid hurting their partner’s feelings. Also, some men may wish to end intercourse, but believe that sex must necessarily end with a man orgasming, and so fake an orgasm to fulfill that. For men, it is more difficult to fake an orgasm, since ejaculation usually accompanies orgasm in males, and their partners can usually see whether or not this happens. Faking orgasms in men becomes easier while using condoms. In rare cases, a man is worried that the condom is torn or will tear, and that he will unintentionally make his partner pregnant, and so he fakes an orgasm in order to avoid ejaculation.

== Brain activity ==
In a 2005 University of Groningen study conducted by Gert Holstege and Janniko R. Georgiadis, the brain activity of 24 men and women (12 couples) was observed in an MRI scanner in different circumstances. For the female participants, their brain was scanned in four states: simply resting, faking an orgasm, having their clitoris stimulated by their male partner&#x27;s fingers, and clitoral stimulation to the point of orgasm. Brain scans found that, when women were tasked to fake an orgasm, the female brain centres that control conscious movement remained active, whereas when they experienced real orgasms, all activity disappeared from the movement control centres, and the light from the emotional centres of the brain went out as well. With the exception of some Brodmann areas of the cerebral cortex (which only showed activation in men), the same brain regions were activated or shut down in men and women during real orgasms (although the female orgasm was found to be longer and more intense on average). 

According to a PET study by Huynh et al. (2013) the dorsolateral (left) side of the pontine tegmentum area was always activated whenever women had a real orgasm, attempted but failed to have an orgasm, and imitated (faked) an orgasm, whereas the ventrolateral (right) side of the pontine tegmentum was only activated when women had a real orgasm.

== Other factors==

Orgasm is not always achieved easily during sexual activity. For both sexes, the condition of being unable to orgasm during sex is known as anorgasmia; it can be caused by a variety of factors, including factors in one&#x27;s life such as stress, anxiety, depression, or fatigue, as well as factors related to the sex itself; including worry, guilt, fear of painful intercourse, fear of pregnancy, the undesirability of a partner, and the undesirability of a setting. It can also be caused by drug use, including alcohol and other substances, or side effects from prescription drugs.

People can fake orgasms for number of reasons, such as when their partner wants them to orgasm but they are unable, or when they desire to stop having sex but are not comfortable telling their partner directly, avoiding negative consequences, or for pleasing their partner.

That women should fake an orgasm was, about the year AD 2, recommended by the Roman poet Ovid in his famous book &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot;:

Patricia Watson (2002) noted that, although a preceding line (&quot;sentiat ex imis Venerem resoluta medullis / femina, et ex aequo res iuuet illa duos&quot;) advises that women should enjoy sex, too, the context shows that Ovid was primarily concerned with male sexual satisfaction: he recommended which sexual positions would make the woman most appealing to the man, and that if the woman was unable to orgasm, she should at least fake it for her male lover&#x27;s enjoyment.

People can also fake orgasms for reasons of display or presentation, such as during phone sex, or in pornography.

Women with higher incomes than their partner are twice as likely to fake orgasms and have a lower rate of sexual satisfaction. Perceived masculine fragility also increases fake orgasms and decreases satisfaction.

Feminists have asserted that women faking orgasms is a sign of male-centered sexuality; in a society that celebrates only male sexual pleasure, women may feel pressured to engage in acts that bring their male partners to orgasm but that do not provide them physical pleasure. Women in a discussion group in 1967 analyzed their motivations for faking orgasms and decided that faking was a response to pressures placed upon them by men. As such, the urge to fake an orgasm often sits in a broader context of other problems with sexual repression or male-centered sexuality. Many of these women also experienced feelings such as sexual rejection by their partners, or on the other hand, unwanted sexual attention; some were afraid to tell their partners what they wanted, and others said their partners resented being told what they wanted.

Hugo M. Mialon developed a game theoretical analysis of faking orgasms as a signaling game. Only some of the predictions of his model were consistent with survey data used to check the validity of the model. Among other things, the survey data suggested that both women and men who would be more concerned if their partner were faking are less likely to fake themselves, and that older women and men are more likely to fake than younger ones.

One study of orgasm found that women who fake orgasms were more likely to neglect their partners and flirt with other men at social gatherings. The authors of this study speculated that women who fake orgasms may be more likely to engage in sexual intercourse with men other than their partner, although they recommended caution at interpreting their findings due to a small data set and a large number of variables being studied.

In therapy or counseling, women are more likely to inaccurately portray their sexual behavior (such as by claiming to orgasm when they do not) to a male therapist than to a female one, although women may still withhold the same information from female therapists.

== Evolutionary perspective ==
From an evolutionary perspective, females might fake orgasms in order to signal fidelity to a male partner, particularly if he is of low-genetic quality. If a female has sex with many partners (employing a polygamous mating strategy), her aim may be to secure benefits from multiple males, such as resources, whilst aiming to only reproduce with males of high-genetic quality. In order to secure resources from low-genetic males, the female would need to imply commitment to reproduction with each male, as males do not want to waste resources on a female who may not sire their child.

A true orgasm is known to increase the number of sperm carried to the uterus post-male orgasm (suggesting reproductive benefits) and has suggested pair-bonding benefits. Faking an orgasm with a low-genetic quality mate would lead that mate to believe that: a) they could be the father of a child born to that mother and b) that the female is committed to them and them alone, because she appears satisfied.

A fake orgasm could also be a mate-retention technique, as research has indicated that women who perceive a greater risk of infidelity from their partner report a greater number of faked orgasms. This behavior would be beneficial for the female in retaining a long-term mate, as women who appear to have frequent orgasms have partners that report higher levels of satisfaction in their relationship, in comparison to women that do not orgasm as frequently. Some research has indicated that women who fake orgasm frequently have also been shown to display other mate retention behaviors, which include:
* Mate guarding (e.g. paying attention to who the partner is spending time with and often checking up on them);
* Inter-sexual negative inducements (flirting with another individual whilst their partner is looking);
* Positive inducements (e.g. dressing in a certain manner to impress their partner)
* Displaying possession signals in public (e.g., kissing a partner in view of other females who are seen as a threat); and,
* Intra-sexual negative inducements (e.g., displaying aggressive behavior towards another female who is caught looking at their partner).

The frequency to which these other forms of mate retention occur is directly related to the risk of infidelity; limited research indicates that once the risk of infidelity is controlled for, the prevalence of other mate retention behaviors are greatly reduced.

Fake orgasm has also been shown to function as a mate-retention technique when the female, as opposed to the male, has a higher risk of infidelity. For example, it has been suggested that a main function of female orgasm is to retain the sperm of a favored partner, therefore it is advantageous for men to pay attention to their partners orgasm to ensure they have been selected. Men who are heavily invested in their relationship would experience greater costs in potential cuckoldry and sperm competition. Consequently, in situations where the woman has a perceived high risk of infidelity, men may be especially interested in ensuring their partner attains a copulatory orgasm. Due to this attentiveness, women may fake an orgasm in order to manipulate their level of commitment signalling mate selection to their partner. Commitment manipulation is a mate-retention technique in itself, often displayed by a partner when there is a perceived risk of infidelity. While research has shown that 25 percent of males also display fake orgasms, there is limited research into this area with no current evidence suggesting that men fake an orgasm to retain a mate. The main reasons men gave for faking an orgasm is that they wanted the sex to end as achieving orgasm was unlikely but did not want to hurt the feelings of their partner.

A study of orgasms in female humans suggested that most men are quite accurate in knowing whether their partners faked orgasm or not. In this study, accuracy was varied (for example, one man suggesting that his partner never faked orgasm, and his partner suggesting that she faked orgasm 100 percent of the time), but the general moderate accuracy of men in detecting fake orgasm suggests that it may be an evolutionary counter-adaptation by men in order to not be fooled into believing female attempts at implying commitment (monogamy) and in order to detect the true satisfaction levels of the female partner. The idea that men place great importance on female mate orgasm lends support to this theory.

== In the media ==

The topic of fake orgasm was brought to the mainstream in 1970 by Susan Lydon, who published &quot;The Politics of Orgasm&quot; in &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine. She wrote, &quot;With their men, they often fake orgasm to appear &#x27;good in bed&#x27; and thus place an intolerable physical burden on themselves and a psychological burden on the men unlucky enough to see through the ruse.&quot; Newspapers and radio talk shows debated her work. Women began to demand equal rights in bed, insisting that their pleasure was its own goal.

The 1989 American film &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; is well known for a scene in which the character Sally, played by Meg Ryan, fakes an orgasm while sitting in a crowded deli in order to demonstrate how persuasive a fake orgasm can be.

In &quot;The Mango&quot; episode of the American sitcom television program &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, the main characters Elaine and Kramer admit to faking orgasms, and another main character, George, becomes paranoid that his own girlfriend has been faking orgasms based on Elaine&#x27;s admission that she faked orgasms &quot;all the time&quot; while with Jerry, who subsequently becomes desperate to have orgasmic sex with Elaine in order to &quot;save the friendship.&quot;

<text>Michael Peter &quot;Micky&quot; Spilotro (September 12, 1944 – June 14, 1986) was the younger brother of Anthony &quot;Tony the Ant&quot; Spilotro and was an associate of the Chicago organized crime organization referred to as &quot;The Outfit&quot;.

==Family background==
Michael was born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 12, 1944. He was the son of Pasquale Spilotro, Sr. (1899–1954), a restaurant owner, and his wife, Antoinette. Michael had five brothers, Vincent, Victor, Pasquale &quot;Pat&quot; Jr., Tony and John.

He attended Burbank Elementary School in Austin, Chicago, and entered Charles P. Steinmetz Academic Centre in 1953 with his brothers Victor, Vincent, Anthony and Pasquale. Michael attended (what is now) Providence St. Mel School in East Garfield Park, Chicago from 1958 to 1962.

His parents, Pasquale Spilotro, Sr. (who emigrated from Triggiano, Italy and arrived at Ellis Island in 1914) and Antoinette Spilotro (who was a domineering mother), owned Patsy&#x27;s Restaurant. Unlike most Italian immigrants, who settled in &quot;The Patch,&quot; (located around Grand and Western Avenues), the Spilotros lived at 2152 North Melvina Avenue in Belmont Cragin, Chicago.

Mobsters such as Salvatore &quot;Sam&quot; Giancana, Jackie &quot;The Lackey&quot; Cerone, Gus Alex and Frank Nitti (&quot;Frank the Enforcer&quot;) regularly dined at Patsy&#x27;s, which was on the west side at Grand and Ogden Avenues, using its parking lot for mob meetings. Patsy&#x27;s was a small place famous for its homemade meatballs that attracted people from all over town including Anthony Accardo, Paul Ricca, Sam Giancana, Gus Alex and Jackie Cerone.

In 1954, Pasquale, Sr. suffered a fatal aneurysm and died at the age of fifty-five.

His brother Anthony would later transfer to a trade school with Frank Cullotta. Michael graduated high school and shortly began to follow in his older brother Tony&#x27;s footsteps.

Michael&#x27;s brother, Pasquale, became an oral surgeon and dentist in the Chicago area, and Vincent lived a law-abiding life.

Tony, John and Victor became criminals like Michael. As a child he and his brothers grew up in a two-story wooden bungalow just a few blocks from Frank Rosenthal&#x27;s childhood home.

Michael spoke in a dapper Chicago accent and pronounced his vowels flat.

He was married to Anne Spilotro and father to Michelle Spilotro Capozzoli, Paula Spilotro, and Michael Spilotro Jr. (born May 21, 1977).

He had once been arrested for aggravated assault with Rocco Lombardo, the younger brother of future mob boss Joseph Lombardo and Peter Schivarelli, a former University of Notre Dame football player, but the trio had been acquitted.

Spilotro&#x27;s wife and daughter would later testify in 2007 for the prosecution regarding the Spilotro Brothers&#x27; involvement with James Marcello.

In 2007, Anne Spilotro testified at the Family Secrets trial about how she reached out to mob boss James Marcello for help and allegedly was swindled after selling her husband&#x27;s Chicago restaurant to state Democratic Senator James DeLeo and attorney James Banks, the nephew of Chicago&#x27;s 36th Ward Alderman William Banks. Upon hearing the allegations, DeLeo expressed amazement at her complaint to reporters. DeLeo said he and James Banks converted the restaurant into a pizza parlor that later failed.

==Bit-part Hollywood career==
Michael was friends with actor Robert Conrad and, through Conrad, also became close friends with Robert&#x27;s fellow Hollywood actor Larry Manetti (one of the supporting stars of &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;) and his wife Nancy DeCarl. In a 2008 interview, Conrad described Michael Spilotro as his &quot;best friend&quot;.

Michael first met Robert Conrad in May 1954, when Robert was only 19 years old. At the time, Conrad had eloped with a lawyer&#x27;s daughter and lied about his age to gain employment as a longshoreman on the Chicago waterfront. He was later fired in December of that year for handing out a petition to have his union steward fired. The two remained close and Michael later appeared as a stick-up man in Conrad&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Duke&quot; in 1979. On the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) website, Michael is labeled as a dramatic actor. Through Conrad, he became close with actors Patrick Wayne, Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams. He later was featured in &quot;Will: The Autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy&quot;, released in 1982, and with Tom Selleck in the first season of the TV series Magnum, P.I., in the episode 12 entitled &quot;Thicker Than Blood&quot;, as an armed federal marshal.

After temporarily moving to Las Vegas shortly before his death, in order to tend to his indictment in the months-long Hole in the Wall Gang trial, Michael allegedly helped run a local jewelry store called The Goldrush Ltd, with Anthony and his other brother John, who worked as a bookmaker. Michael soon became involved in bookmaking, drug dealing, prostitution, robbery, and extortion. Through his relationship with Larry Manetti he had connections in the Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino, when it was under the ownership of the Barrick Gaming Corporation. Lifelong friend and fellow actor Larry Manetti told reporters from the Chicago Tribune during the Family Trial, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know Michael was a gangster. I knew him as a guy I grew up with in the neighborhood. Michael wanted to be on TV, that&#x27;s all. Who wouldn&#x27;t?... He wasn&#x27;t trying to be a movie star or an actor, he was having fun.&quot; Manetti commented to reporters about Michael&#x27;s acting ability stating, &quot;He was OK as an actor, he wasn&#x27;t so stiff.&quot; Robert Conrad attended funerals of the Spilotro family, and made no effort to hide his appearances from the press there. There was no attempt on the part of either Robert Conrad or Larry Manetti to attend the funerals of Anthony or Michael.. He didn&#x27;t appear publicly with either brother, even when they were alive. Conrad attempted to keep his association &quot;sub rosa&quot; also. When he encountered a bus load of tourists when Anthony Spilotro&#x27;s Monte Carlo automobile collided with it, he quickly left before attention could be drawn.

==The Hole In The Wall Gang==

Spilotro, in 1978, formed a burglary ring with his brother Anthony and Herbert Blitzstein, utilizing about eight associates as burglars. The crew became known as the Hole in the Wall Gang because of its penchant for gaining entry by drilling through the exterior walls and ceilings of the buildings they burglarized. The Hole in the Wall Gang operated out of The Gold Rush, Ltd.

Other gang members included his younger brother John Paul Spilotro, Polish-American brothers Peanuts Pancsko, Butch Pancsko and Pops Pancsko, Frank DeLegge, French-Canadian Michael LaJoy, Joseph D&#x27;Argento, Swedish-American Gerald Tomasczek, Peter Basile of Wilmette, Illinois, Carl Urbanotti of Chicago, Illinois, Ernest Lehnigg of Addison, Illinois, Samuel Cusumano, Joseph Cusumano, Ernesto &quot;Ernie&quot; Davino, 34, Las Vegas, &quot;Crazy Larry&quot; Neumann, Wayne Matecki, Salvatore &quot;Sonny&quot; Romano, Leonardo &quot;Leo&quot; Guardino, 47, Las Vegas, Frank Cullotta, 43, Las Vegas, and former Las Vegas Sheriff&#x27;s Department Detective, Joseph Blasko, 45, Las Vegas, who acted as a lookout and who later worked as a bartender at the Crazy Horse Too, a gentleman&#x27;s club, and died of a heart attack in 2002.

Following the botched burglary at Bertha&#x27;s Household Products on July 4, 1981, Cullotta, Blasko, Guardino, Davino, Neumann, and Matecki were arrested and each charged with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, attempted grand larceny and possession of burglary tools. They were locked into the Las Vegas police department&#x27;s holding cell in downtown Las Vegas. The only members of Spilotro&#x27;s gang not arrested for the July 4 burglary were Blitzstein, Michael Spilotro, Romano and Cusumano. Meanwhile, Cullotta had turned state&#x27;s witness, testifying against Anthony and to a lesser extent Michael Spilotro. But the testimony was insufficient, and Michael was acquitted and Tony Spilotro had a mistrial.

==Death==
Spilotro and his brother Anthony disappeared on June 14, 1986, after they drove away together from Michael&#x27;s Oak Park home. Michael&#x27;s wife, Anne, reported both brothers missing on June 16. Michael&#x27;s car, a 1986 Lincoln, was recovered several days later in a motel parking lot near O&#x27;Hare International Airport. On June 22, their bodies were found, one on top of the other and stripped down to their undershorts, buried in a cornfield in the Willow Slough preserve near Enos, Indiana. The freshly turned earth had been noticed by a farmer who thought that the remains of a deer killed out of season had been buried there by a poacher, and notified authorities. An autopsy completed on June 24, identified their cause of death by blunt force trauma, and had been dead since June 14. They were identified by dental charts supplied by their dentist brother, Patrick Spilotro. The two were buried in a family plot at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois on June 27.

In January 1986, in the wake of the imprisonment of Joseph Aiuppa and John Cerone for skimming Las Vegas casino profits, a meeting was held at the Czech Lodge in North Riverside, Illinois. Most of the &quot;upper echelon&quot; were there, including Outfit boss Tony &quot;Joe Batters&quot; Accardo. Accardo had decided to appoint Samuel Carlisi as the &quot;Street Boss&quot; in charge of Outfit operations to replace Aiuppa. Carlisi told the group that Accardo would stay on as &quot;consigliere&quot; and would have final say, as well as Gus Alex staying head of the connection guys. He then went on to the first problem: Spilotro, and how things had gone down since he took over Vegas. Mobster and mob enforcer Rocco Infelice said, &quot;Hit him.&quot; Everyone else at the meeting agreed. Spilotro was replaced in Las Vegas by Donald &quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot; Angelini.

Although the original reports stated the Spilotros were beaten and buried in the Enos, Indiana, cornfield, mobster Nicholas Calabrese testified at the &quot;Operation Family Secrets&quot; in 2007 that the brothers were killed in a Bensenville, Illinois, basement where the Spilotros believed Michael would be inducted into The Outfit, then transported to the cornfield. According to court testimony, when Tony entered the basement and realized what was about to occur, he asked if he could &quot;say a prayer&quot;.

No arrests were made until April 25, 2005, when 14 members of the Chicago Outfit (including reputed boss James Marcello) were indicted for 18 murders, including the Spilotros. The suspected murderers included &quot;capo&quot; Albert Tocco from Chicago Heights, Illinois, who was sentenced to 200 years in prison in 1990, after his wife testified against him. She testified that in 1986 she drove her husband from an Indiana cornfield where he told her he had just buried Spilotro. Another suspect in the murders was Frank &quot;The German&quot; Schweihs, a convicted extortionist and alleged Chicago assassin who was suspected of involvement in several murders including the Spilotros, Allen Dorfman (of the Teamster&#x27;s Pension Fund), and a former girlfriend. Schweihs was arrested by the FBI on December 22, 2005. At the time, he was a fugitive living in a Berea, Kentucky apartment complex. Schweihs had slipped away before prosecutors were able to arrest him and 13 others, including Marcello.

On May 18, 2007, the star witness in the government&#x27;s case against 14 Chicago mob figures, Nicholas Calabrese, pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy that included 18 murders, including the hits on Anthony and Michael Spilotro. Under heavy security, Calabrese admitted that he took part in planning or carrying out 14 of the murders, including the Spilotro killings. He became the key witness against his brother, Frank Calabrese, Sr., and other major mob figures charged in the government&#x27;s Family Secrets Trial. Calabrese agreed to testify after the FBI showed him DNA evidence linking him to the murder of fellow hit-man John Fecarotta, who was also allegedly involved in the Spilotro slayings.

In September 2007, Frank Calabrese, Sr. and four other men − Marcello, Joseph Lombardo, Paul &quot;The Indian&quot; Schiro, and former Chicago police officer Anthony &quot;Twan&quot; Doyle − were convicted of mob-related crimes. On September 27, 2007, Marcello was found guilty by a federal jury in the murders of both Spilotro brothers. On February 5, 2009, Marcello was sentenced to Life imprisonment for the Spilotro murders, and United States District Judge James Zagel, agreeing with the presentation made by federal prosecutor Markus Funk, also found Marcello responsible for the D&#x27;Andrea murder as well, even though the jury had deadlocked on that count. On March 26, 2009, Nicholas Calabrese was sentenced to 12 years and four months imprisonment.

==In popular culture==
The character Dominick &quot;Dom&quot; Santoro in the 1995 film &quot;Casino&quot; is based on Michael Spilotro, and played by Philip Suriano. Dominick is shown assisting his older brother Nicky and his crew in beating up a man outside a bar, spitting in a police officer&#x27;s sandwich, and later shooting up a cop&#x27;s home in revenge for the death of a crew member. In the infamous cornfield scene at the film&#x27;s climax, Dominick is the first of the brothers to be brutally beaten by Frank Marino and the rest of their crew while Nicky is forced to watch. When Nicky pleads for Dominick&#x27;s life, Marino spitefully lands two particularly vicious blows to Dominick&#x27;s head, leaving Dominick only barely conscious as he is thrown into the hole to be buried alive with Nicky moments later.

<text>Peter Charles McCarthy Robinson (9 November 1951 – 6 October 2004) was an Anglo-Irish comedian, radio and television presenter and travel writer. He was noted for his best-selling travel books &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Bar&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Road to McCarthy&quot; (2002), in which he explored western Ireland and the Irish diaspora around the world.

==Summary==

Born in Warrington, Lancashire to an English father of Irish descent and an Irish mother, McCarthy spent much of his early life in Ireland and developed a love for the country. He decided to become a writer and studied English at Leicester University. After a brief stint as a teacher he moved to Brighton, where he became involved in local art community projects. He discovered a talent for comedy and co-founded a successful comedy troupe, in which he wrote and performed for ten years.

He became a solo stand-up comic and comedy writer, and after success with &quot;The Hangover Show&quot; in 1990 he presented television and radio shows. In 2000 he published &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Bar&quot;, an account of his travels around Western Ireland. He followed &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Bar&quot; in 2002 with &quot;The Road to McCarthy&quot;. A third book remained unfinished when he died of cancer in 2004.

==Biography==

===Early life : 1951–1974===
McCarthy was born on 9 November 1951 in Warrington, Lancashire. His Irish mother had moved to England during the Second World War to work as a nurse and met her future husband at a dance. They had four children, of whom Peter was the first. McCarthy was educated at West Park Grammar School in St Helens, a Roman Catholic institution run by the Christian Brothers. He later described this experience as &quot;a mixture of hellfire and brimstone, corporal punishment and awakening sexuality&quot;. The Christian Brothers&#x27; authoritarian education methods, which included &quot;a fair bit of random brutality&quot;, he described as &quot;carrot and stick without the carrot&quot;.

As a child, he spent his school holidays in Drimoleague in West Cork, Ireland, and stayed with relatives on the farm called &quot;Butlersgift&quot; where his mother had grown up, a place that he later described as &quot;straight from a story book&quot;. This time spent in Ireland inspired a fascination with the country that was evident later in his travel writing. In his teenage years he considered becoming a member of the Roman Catholic clergy, but was dissuaded by his local priest. After reading James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; at the age of 14, he decided instead to be a writer.

McCarthy attended Leicester University and earned a first-class degree in English literature. He studied at a teacher training college and taught English and Drama at a comprehensive school on the coast of Suffolk.

===Comedy and television: 1975–1997===
In 1975, McCarthy moved to Brighton, East Sussex, and worked in a community arts project in nearby Shoreham-by-Sea, which led to his first television appearance, on &quot;Tommy Tractor&#x27;s Triffic Toyshop Show&quot; (1977), a show for primary school children. He moved into comedy, co-founded Cliff Hanger Theatre with friends Robin Driscoll, Steve McNicholas, Tony Haase and Rebecca Stevens, and discovered a talent for verbal repartee. He was described as &quot;a brilliantly funny writer and performer&quot;. 

The company toured the country performing in pubs, and their first show, &quot;The Featherstone Flyer&quot; (1978), was premiered in the Hope and Anchor in Islington, North London. &quot;The Featherstone Flyer&quot; was followed by &quot;Dig for Victory&quot; (1980–81), &quot;Captive Audience&quot; (1981–82), &quot;They Came From Somewhere Else!&quot; (1982–83), &quot;Gymslip Vicar&quot; (1984-85), which was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award, and &quot;James Bond&quot; (1988). The success of the stage shows led to the creation of two television series, &quot;They Came From Somewhere Else&quot; (1984) for Channel 4 and &quot;Mornin&#x27; Sarge&quot; (1989) on BBC2.

In 1987, McCarthy began performing solo stand-up comedy, adopting his mother&#x27;s surname as his stage name after learning of another actor using the name Peter Robinson. For the 1987 Brighton Festival he created &quot;Boredom and Black Magic in Hove&quot;, a three-hour coach tour and pub crawl. McCarthy acted as guide, inventing surreal explanations for the sights of Hove. Audiences &quot;had to jump across the border from Brighton to Hove, where they were handed a glass of sweet sherry. Pete then took them on a tour around Hove, making up the sights as he went along.&quot; The show won the best cabaret act in the 1987 Zap Club Awards.

McCarthy took his next show, &quot;Live in Your Living Room&quot;, from 1987–8 to the Edinburgh, Melbourne and Brighton festivals. He performed in people&#x27;s homes in bedrooms, bathrooms and living rooms to audiences of 10-20. The subject of the show was the metaphysical effects of a hangover. The Brighton Argus reviewer wrote, &quot;The hour-long tour-de-force begins with an apparently hungover Peter in bed, surrounded by empty bottles, and transfers to the living room, where he sports a revolting 1970s stretch burgundy outfit, threatens a striptease and then fortunately changes his mind...In between he delivers a quick-fire monologue which develops from the perils of drinking to tragicomic stuff touching on loneliness, death and unrequited love.&quot;

In 1990 McCarthy explored this theme further in &quot;The Hangover Show&quot;, directed by John Dowie. He was awarded the Critic&#x27;s Award for Best Comedy and nominated for the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The show was developed into a one-off television special for BBC Scotland which was broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Day 1991.
He regularly compered at The Comedy Store in Central London. As a stand-up comedian, McCarthy often drew on his Irish Catholic background as a source of material. The Guardian described him as &quot;someone who took infinite pleasure in the comic strangeness of other human beings.&quot; He wrote and performed in a two-man comedy show with the Liverpudlian poet Roger McGough which toured in Britain and Australia. In the 1980s he began writing television scripts and gags for the comedians Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones. 

As a result of &quot;The Hangover Show&quot;, McCarthy was given his own unconventional &#x27;alternative&#x27; travel show, &quot;Travelog&quot;, by Channel 4. McCarthy recalled: &quot;We travelled to Zanzibar and China, Fiji and Corsica, Costa Rica and Laos, stood on the edge of volcanoes, had lunch with heroes of the Crete resistance, and got caught up in a military coup in Vanuatu&quot;. He starred in a string of other television and radio shows throughout the 1990&#x27;s, including BBC 2&#x27;s &quot;Country Tracks&quot; (1998); Meridian Television&#x27;s &quot;The Pier&quot;; and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Desperately Seeking Something&quot; (1995–1998), an exploration of alternative religious movements around the world. For BBC Radio 4, he presented &quot;Breakaway&quot;, &quot;First Impressions&quot;, &quot;X Marks the Spot&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Cajun Country&quot;, as well as appearing as a regular guest on &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and &quot;The News Quiz&quot;.

===Travel writing: 1998–2004===

In March 1998 Hodder and Stoughton published McCarthy&#x27;s first travel book, &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Bar: A Journey Of Discovery In Ireland&quot;, in which he described his travels and adventures in the west of the country, from Cork to Donegal, and the people he encountered during a quest to find pubs and bars called McCarthy&#x27;s. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the book as an &quot;affectionate, revealing and well-lubricated look at the changing face of a country&quot;. 

McCarthy won &quot;Newcomer of the Year&quot; at the British Book Awards in 2002, and &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Bar&quot; was a great success, selling over a million copies. McCarthy admitted to a childlike pleasure in seeing his book take its place on the shelves among writers he had admired for years, and joked &quot;If the literary life gets a little dull, there&#x27;s always the thrill of going into W H Smith and moving &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Bar&quot; in front of Bill Bryson.&quot; 

His follow-up travel book, &quot;The Road to McCarthy&quot;, an account of further Irish-themed travels in Gibraltar, Morocco, New York City, Montana, Tasmania, Montserrat and Alaska in search of a McCarthy clan chieftain, was published in 2002.

Peter McCarthy wrote his books with pen and paper. Asked if he was a technophobe, he said: &quot;Yes big time. I&#x27;ve got a kettle and a fridge, but I don&#x27;t own a computer, a word processor or even a typewriter.&quot;

He said in &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Bar&quot; that his grandfather&#x27;s surname had been spelled &#x27;MacCarthy&#x27;. &quot;It&#x27;s a translation from the Irish, the &#x27;a&#x27; is optional.&quot; An uncle in County Cork told him that names of his ancestors in the 1700s had been recorded as &quot;MacCartai&quot;.

==Later life and death==

McCarthy moved with his family from Brighton to a village in the South Downs in East Sussex, and enjoyed taking solitary walks across the Downs. He described the landscape as &quot;a kind of neolithic M25&quot;. After the success of his previous books, he was planning to write a third travel work exploring the six counties of Northern Ireland. 

McCarthy was diagnosed with cancer in February 2004 and died at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton on 6 October 2004 at the age of 52. He was survived by his wife Irene and three daughters, Alice, Isabella and Coral.

Bus operator Brighton &amp; Hove named one of its fleet – bus 913 – after him in September 2006.

<doc id="1049726" wikidata="Q335797" url="?curid=1049726" title="Julian Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith">
<text>Julian Edward George Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith, (22 April 1916 – 16 January 2011) was a British colonial administrator and hereditary peer.

==Background and education==
Asquith was the only son of Katharine (née Horner) and Raymond Asquith, a barrister. He was the grandson of H. H. Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith, British Prime Minister from 1908 until 1916. Lord Oxford&#x27;s two older sisters both predeceased him; the younger of these was Lady Perdita Rose Mary Asquith, later Lady Hylton (1910–1996), who was married to William Jolliffe, 4th Baron Hylton and became the grandmother of the actress Anna Chancellor.

He inherited the earldom in 1928 on the death of his grandfather, since his father had been killed in the First World War. He was raised as a Roman Catholic after his mother&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism in 1923. He was educated at St Ronan&#x27;s School and Ampleforth College, going on to study at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated with Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees. In 1936, he attended the opening of the new building of Campion Hall, a Catholic institution within the University, with the Duke of Alba, Spanish ambassador to London, and Alban Goodier S.J., the former Archbishop of Bombay.

In 1940, Asquith was commissioned in the Royal Engineers and served with 3 Field Squadron in Egypt. From 1942 to 1948 he was an Assistant District Commissioner in Palestine.

==Career==
After the war, Lord Oxford pursued a career in the Colonial Service. He was Deputy chairman Secretary of the British Administration Tripolitania from 1949 to 1950, Director of Interior Tripolitania in 1951 and Advisor to the Prime Minister of Libya in 1952. In 1955 he was Administrative Secretary of Zanzibar and from 1958 to 1962 was the Administrator of Saint Lucia. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1961.

Oxford was the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Seychelles from 1962 to 1967, and the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory from 1965 to 1967. In 1964, he was advanced as Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. He also held the posts of Constitutional Commander of the Cayman Islands in 1971, and Turks and Caicos Islands from 1973 to 1974.

==Marriage and children==
On 28 August 1947, Lord Oxford married Anne Mary Celestine Palairet, daughter of Mary de Vere Studd and Sir Michael Palairet (1882–1956) at the Brompton Oratory. Anne Oxford was also a Roman Catholic via her parents&#x27; conversions.

Lord and Lady Oxford had five children: three daughters (the second of which is married to a diplomat) and two sons, both diplomats:

* Lady (Mary) Annunziata Asquith (born 28 July 1948), partner of Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield
* Lady Katharine Rose Celestine Asquith (born 1 October 1949), in 1970 married Adam Ridley, divorced 1976; married secondly 1985 Nathaniel Page, son of Sir John Page. 
* Raymond Benedict Bartholomew Asquith, 3rd Earl of Oxford and Asquith (born 24 August 1952)
* Lady Clare Perpetua Frances Asquith (born 28 March 1955)
* Sir Dominic Antony Gerard Asquith (born 7 February 1957), a former British Ambassador to Iraq, Egypt and Libya.

Lord Oxford inherited the estate of Mells Manor from his mother Katharine Asquith, the younger daughter of Frances Jane (née Graham) and Sir John Francis Fortescue Horner.

The Countess of Oxford and Asquith died in 1998. The Earl died, aged 94, on 16 January 2011. He was succeeded in his peerage titles, which he had held for over 80 years, by his elder son, Raymond (b. 1952), a former British diplomat and elected hereditary member of the House of Lords.

<doc id="1049761" wikidata="Q2115150" url="?curid=1049761" title="Exodus (video game)">
<text>Exodus is a video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Color Dreams through its Wisdom Tree label in 1991. Like all Wisdom Tree games, &quot;Exodus&quot; was not officially licensed by Nintendo. It was ported to the Game Boy. &quot;Exodus&quot; is based on &quot;Crystal Mines&quot;, an earlier game from the company when it was known as Color Dreams.

According to the instruction manual, the player controls the biblical figure Moses as he leads the Israelites to the Promised Land, meaning he goes through a labyrinth. Moses has the ability to shoot glowing &quot;W&quot;s, which signify the word of God, to defeat enemies and remove obstacles. To finish each level, Moses must acquire five question marks as well as a certain amount of manna while avoiding enemies such as magicians and soldiers. After a level is completed, the player must answer five multiple choice Bible-related questions before advancing to the next level. After answering enough questions correctly, the player is rewarded with an extra life. The final 50 levels are a mirror of the first 50 with tougher enemies. At the intro screen, players can skip ahead in intervals of five levels until level 81.

The background music of the &quot;Exodus&quot; levels is to the theme of &quot;Father Abraham&quot; (a popular Christian children&#x27;s song named after an iconic figure of the Old Testament).

==Legacy==

Wisdom Tree later released a sequel to &quot;Exodus&quot;, titled &quot;Joshua&quot;, with slightly improved graphics and gameplay.

&quot;Joshua&quot; is based on the Biblical figure Joshua, who was Moses&#x27;s apprentice in the Old Testament. He later became the leader of the Israelite tribes after the death of Moses. Joshua&#x27;s most popular biblical story is about the taking back of the &quot;promised land&quot;, where Joshua sent his men to march around the walls of the city of Jericho for seven days. After God saw his people&#x27;s loyalty, he destroyed the city walls.

Similar to Moses shooting W&#x27;s (to symbolize the word of God) in &quot;Exodus&quot;, Joshua shoots music notes which symbolize the music for the priest&#x27;s trumpets.

Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Joshua&quot; has no level background music.

<doc id="1049763" wikidata="Q628482" url="?curid=1049763" title="George H. Scithers">
<text>George H. Scithers (May 14, 1929 – April 19, 2010) was an American science fiction fan, author and editor.

A long-time member of the World Science Fiction Society, he published a fanzine starting in the 1950s, wrote short stories, and moved on to edit several prominent science fiction magazines, as well as a number of anthologies. As editor emeritus of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, he lectured at the Library of Congress in 2008. Wildside Press published his most recent book, &quot;Cat Tales: Fantastic Feline Fiction&quot;, in 2008.

==Biography==

===Career===
Scithers&#x27; first published fiction, the story &quot;Faithful Messenger&quot;, appeared in &quot;If&quot; magazine in 1969. His involvement in the field, however, dates back to 1957, when he began submitting to the fanzine &quot;Yandro&quot;. Two years later, he began publishing the Hugo Award-winning fanzine &quot;Amra&quot;. The term &quot;swords and sorcery&quot; first appeared there, and &quot;Amra&quot; became a leading proponent of the subgenre. Several of the articles originally published in &quot;Amra&quot; were later reprinted as part of two volumes about Conan the Barbarian, which Scithers co-edited with L. Sprague de Camp.

In 1963, Scithers chaired Discon I, the 21st Worldcon, held in Washington, D.C. He was a regular parliamentarian for business meetings of the World Science Fiction Society and authored a guide to running science fiction conventions, &quot;The Con-Committee Chairman&#x27;s Guide&quot; based on his experiences chairing DisCon 1 in 1963.

In 1973, Scithers founded Owlswick Press, a small independent publishing company. In 1976, Owlswick published Scithers&#x27; book (under the pseudonym Karl Würf), &quot;To Serve Man: A Cookbook for People&quot; (including recipes for &quot;Boiled Leg of Man&quot;, &quot;Texas Chili with Cowboy&quot;, and &quot;Person Kebabs&quot;).

In 1977, he was named the first editor for &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; (&quot;IASFM&quot;). He remained in that position until 1982 and won two more Hugo Awards for his work there. After leaving &quot;IASFM&quot;, Scithers took the helm at &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and edited that magazine until 1986.

In 1988, he worked with John Gregory Betancourt and Darrell Schweitzer to re-establish &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, the magazine that had introduced one of his earliest interests, Conan the Barbarian, to the world. In 1992, he and Schweitzer won a World Fantasy Award for their work on &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

In 2001, Scithers was the fan guest of honor at the Worldcon, Millennium Philcon.

At the 2002 World Fantasy Convention in Minneapolis, both Scithers and Forrest J Ackerman won the World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Awards.

===Personal life===
Scithers served in the Korean War with the United States Army. He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers the Black Widowers. He was also very fond of owls and trains. He resided in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania where &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was edited in his basement, followed by Rockville, Maryland.

===Death===
Scithers died April 19, 2010, two days after suffering a heart attack.

<doc id="1049772" wikidata="Q7053242" url="?curid=1049772" title="Norrbotten Regiment">
<text>The Norrbotten Regiment (), designation I 19, is a Swedish Army arctic armoured, light infantry and commando regiment that traces its origins back to the 19th century. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from the province of Norrbotten, and it is currently garrisoned in Boden, Norrbotten. The regiment has the responsibility for training two armoured and one special recon battalion, as well as number of Arctic light infantry battalions from the home guard as well as running the army&#x27;s winter unit.

As of 2018, the Norrbotten Regiment employs 489 professional officers, 402 full-time soldiers, 512 part-time soldiers, 116 civilians and 683 reserve officers.

== History ==

The regiment was created in 1841 when Västerbotten Field Jäger Regiment was split into two corps units of battalion size, one of them being Norrbotten Field Jäger Corps. The unit was upgraded to regimental size and renamed Norrbotten Regiment in 1892. The regiment had its training grounds at various places in Norrbotten, but was eventually garrisoned in Boden in 1907. A ski battalion was created in 1910, and in 1943 this ski battalion was split off from the regiment, later becoming The Army Ranger School and in 1975 Lapland Ranger Regiment.

The regiment merged with the Norrbotten Armoured Battalion (P 5) in 1975 to form Norrbotten Regiment with Norrbotten Armoured Battalion, designated I 19/P 5. For a short time in the 1990s, the unit was then merged with the wartime-organised Norrbotten Brigade, and designated MekB 19. In 2000, the unit was reorganised once again, and was redesignated back to its old designation I 19 despite being an armoured regiment, the name was also changed back to Norrbotten Regiment.

===Colours, standards and guidons===
The Norrbotten Regiment presents one regimental colour, three battalion colours and two battalion standards:

====Colour of Norrbotten Regiment====
On 31 August 1974, the regiment was presented with a new colour by His Majesty the King Gustaf VI Adolf in connection with the 350th anniversary of the regiment. When the Norrbotten Armoured Battalion (P 5) was amalgamated with the regiment, its standard was carried to the side of the regimental colour. The standard is carried again by the Norrbotten Armoured Battalion since 1 July 2000.

A new colour was presented to the regiment in Boden by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf on 27 August 2001. The colour is drawn by Kristina Holmgård-Åkerberg and embroidered by machine and hand in insertion technique by Maj-Britt Salander/company Blå Kusten. Blazon: &quot;On blue cloth powdered with yellow estoiles, the provincial badge of Västerbotten; a white reindeer at speed, armed and langued red. On a white border at the upper side of the colour, battle honours (Landskrona 1677, Düna 1701, Kliszow 1702, Fraustadt 1706, Malatitze 1708, Strömstad 1717) in blue and close to the staff the provincial badge of Lappland; a red savage with green garlands on head and around loins, clutching a yellow club on right shoulder (a legacy from the former Lappland Brigade, NB 20).

A new colour was presented to the regiment in Boden by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf on 7 September 2019. The colour is drawn by Henrik Dahlström, heraldic artist and graphic designer at the State Herald at the National Archives of Sweden.

<doc id="1049775" wikidata="Q3805702" url="?curid=1049775" title="Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu">
<text>is an action platform video game developed by Now Production and published by Hudson Soft. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 and for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1991.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Jackie Chan, the well-known martial arts stunt master, and brawls against many enemies during his quest to save his sister. The game is played through five levels (each with a boss at the end).

Throughout the game, the player would encounter frogs that carry power-ups or rice bowls (which are items in the game that restore health), but the frogs would have to be hit in order for the item to be obtained. Power-ups can allow the player to do a special type of attack over a limited number of times (although the player is only able to carry one power-up). Jackie is also able to charge a special beam-like attack, although it can only be used up to five times. Most of the enemies that the player defeats will drop green orbs, but enemies killed by beam attacks will not drop any orbs. If the player collects 30 orbs, life will be replenished (as well as the 5 charged shots).

If the player dies, all of the orbs and power-ups are lost and must be gained again. The player only has 1 life in the game, but may continue up to five times initially. Extra continues may be earned through bonus stages throughout the game, which are levels triggered by bells in the levels which transport Jackie to the bonus stages, each of which have a 30-second time limit and usually involve jumping on clouds or hitting statues to earn points. At the end of 30 seconds, those points are tallied and may also be used to buy extra lives and special attacks.

<text>Wanderly Wagon is an Irish children&#x27;s television series which aired on RTÉ from Saturday 30 September 1967 until 1982.

==Plot==
&quot;Wanderly Wagon&quot; followed human and puppet characters as they travelled around Ireland visiting interesting locations, rescuing Princesses and generally doing good. The original premise of the show expanded to follow the characters to magical lands of Irish mythology, and into outer space. The Wagon could fly, and using chroma key effects, the Wagon was shown hovering in mid-air, landing in various magical lands, and even traveling underwater.

==Characters==
* &quot;Rory&quot; - originally the lead character. Played by stage actor Bill Golding. Golding left the series in its middle years.
* &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; - a bumbler played by Eugene Lambert, who was also the puppeteer and ventriloquist for some of the animal characters. Other voices were provided by puppeteer members of the Lambert family.
* &quot;Godmother&quot; - a sensible mother-figure played by Nora O&#x27;Mahoney.
* &quot;Judge&quot; - a dog. He was the voice of reason and good sense, a moral conscience to the rest of them (he also starred in television road safety advertisements). To this day, Judge is held in great affection by people who remember him - many of whom can still sing his song, &quot;I Am the Flying Dog&quot;
* &quot;Fortycoats&quot; - a gruff, bearded character in a costume made of ragged swatches of many different materials, he owned a flying sweetshop. An occasional character who later had an eponymous spin-off show. Originally played by Bill Golding and later by Fran Dempsey.
* &quot;Mr Crow&quot; - a crow who lived in a cuckoo clock. Crow was a sarcastic fellow with a cutting sense of humour.
* &quot;Foxy&quot; - a fox who lived in a barrel on the side of the wagon and spoke with an American gangster style accent.
* &quot;Doctor Astro&quot; - a recurring villain played by Frank Kelly
* &quot;Sneaky Snake&quot; - Doctor Astro&#x27;s sidekick, also voiced by Frank Kelly
* &quot;Maeve the Witch&quot; - a mischievous witch, whose attempts at villainy always ended in failure
* &quot;moon mice&quot; - four mice who lived in the attic.
* &quot;squirrels&quot; - two squirrels played by Miriam Lambert.

==Production==
Don Lennox and Eugene Lambert came up with the idea of &quot;Wanderly Wagon&quot; along with Jim O&#x27;Hare. O&#x27;Hare was recalling a recent family holiday spent on a horse drawn caravan in County Cork. Lennox became the first producer of &quot;Wanderly Wagon&quot; and O&#x27;Hare designed the wagon and the show&#x27;s costumes.

In the early years of the show, each episode was recorded live, and as such there was no editing. If there was a mistake, it would either have to be left in or the whole episode would have to begin shooting again from the start. In addition, boom mics were not in use and each actor had to be fitted with a hidden microphone on a trailing wire, which restricted movement around the set.

Various episodes were written by Neil Jordan, Carolyn Swift, Pat Ingoldsby, Martin Duffy and Frank Kelly, who also played several characters on the show.

The series developed a tradition of transmitting a Christmas Day show from a Dublin children&#x27;s hospital every year. The original Wanderly Wagon used in the making of the show is on display at Tinahely Farm Shop in County Wicklow. The smaller replica of the Wanderly Wagon used when filming the opening scenes of Wanderly Wagon is on display in The Little Museum of Dublin on St. Stephen&#x27;s Green in Dublin.

==Spin-offs==
The character of Fortycoats was given his own show, Fortycoats &amp; Co., played by Fran Dempsey. In the show Fortycoats is accompanied by two companions; Sofar Sogood (played by Conal Kearney), a prim goody two shoes character, and Slightly Bonkers (played by Virginia Cole), a naive schoolgirl. They travelled in the Flying Tuck Shop doing good, and battling the evil Whilomena the Whirligig Witch and The Pickarooney.

<text>Karol Adamiecki (Dąbrowa Górnicza, 18 March 1866 – 16 May 1933, Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish engineer, management researcher, economist, and professor.

==Life==

Karol Adamiecki was a prominent management researcher in Eastern and Central Europe. He began his research at the Institute of Technology in St. Petersburg, Russia (1884–90). In 1891 he graduated in engineering from the university in St. Petersburg. He then returned to Dąbrowa Górnicza, where he was in charge of a steel rolling mill. While working in the steel industry, he developed his ideas on management.

In 1919 he joined the Warsaw Polytechnic as a lecturer, becoming a professor in 1922. From 1922 he headed the newly established Department of Work Organization and Industrial Enterprises at the Polytechnic&#x27;s Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. He was the founder and first director (1925–1933) of the Institute of Scientific Organization () in Warsaw. He served as vice president of the European Association of Scientific Management ().

In 1896 Adamiecki invented a novel means of displaying interdependent processes so as to enhance the visibility of production schedules. In 1903 his theory caused a stir in Russian technical circles. He published some articles on it in the Polish magazine &quot;Przegląd Techniczny&quot; (&quot;Technical Review&quot;), nos. 17, 18, 19 and 20 (1909). In 1931 he published a more widely known article describing his diagram, which he called the &quot;harmonogram&quot; or &quot;harmonograf&quot;. Adamiecki had, however, published his works in Polish and Russian, languages little known in the English-speaking world. By this time, a similar method had been popularized in the West by Henry Gantt (who had published articles on it in 1910 and 1915). With minor modifications, Adamiecki&#x27;s chart is now more commonly referred to in English as the Gantt chart.

Adamiecki published his first papers in management in 1898, before Frederick Winslow Taylor had popularized scientific management. In 1925 Adamiecki founded the Polish Institute of Scientific Management.

He did most of his research and observations in the field of metallurgy. 

He is the author of the law of harmony in management: harmony should comprise three parts:
* harmony of choice (all production tools should be mutually compatible, with special regard to their output production speed)
* harmony of doing (the importance of time coordination — schedules and timetables)
* harmony of spirit (the importance of creating a good team)

In 1972 the State College of Economic Administration in Katowice was named after him, and in 1974 it became the Karol Adamiecki University of Economics (&quot;Akademia Ekonomiczna im. Karola Adamieckiego w Katowicach&quot;).

<text>Francis E. Gaul (August 8, 1924 - September 15, 2013) was an American politician of the Democratic party. He was the Treasurer of Cuyahoga County, Ohio from 1976 to 1995.

Gaul started his career as a city councilman in Cleveland, Ohio, representing a predominantly Irish-Catholic ward on the west side.

==Treasurer of Cuyahoga County==
Gaul served as Treasurer of Cuyahoga County from 1975 to 1996.

In 1994, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; reported that Gaul had made risky investments using county funds through the Secured Assets Fund Earnings (SAFE) investment pool. When the investment pool collapsed, the county lost $115 million. In 1997, Gaul was acquitted by the Ohio Court of Appeals of any criminal wrongdoing in association with SAFE. The court overturned Gaul&#x27;s conviction by an inferior court for &quot;dereliction of duty&quot;, for which he had been sentenced to 90 days in jail.

In 1989, Gaul was criticized for appearing in radio advertisements in which he endorsed certificates of deposits at Transohio Saving Bank. Gaul said he had been paid for the advertisements but donated the payment to charity.

==Other political offices and candidacies==
Gaul also served on Cleveland City Council and on the board of the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority.

In 1994, Gaul was the Democratic nominee who unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Martin R. Hoke. In 1982, he was a candidate in the Democratic Primary for Ohio Secretary of State, won by Sherrod Brown.

<text>Dietikon District is a district of the Swiss canton of Zürich. The capital of the district of Dietikon is the city of Dietikon, located in the Limmat Valley (German: &quot;Limmattal&quot;).

Dietikon District was created in 1989 by splitting the former Zürich District into three parts. The western part became the Dietikon District, the eastern part became the district (respectively city) of Zürich and the municipality of Zollikon (located east of Zürich) was integrated into the Meilen District.

<doc id="1049844" wikidata="Q948174" url="?curid=1049844" title="Football in Italy">
<text>Football ( ) is the most popular sport in Italy. The Italy national football team is considered one of the best national teams in the world. They have won the FIFA World Cup four times (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006), trailing only Brazil (with five), runners-up in two finals both against Brazil, (1970, 1994) and reaching a third place (1990) and a fourth place (1978). They have also won two European Championships (1968 and 2020), also appeared in two finals (2000, 2012), finished third at the Confederations Cup (2013) and the Nations League (2021 and 2023), won one Olympic football tournament (1936) and two Central European International Cups (1927–30 and 1933–35).

Italy&#x27;s top domestic league, the Serie A, is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world because it is often depicted as the most tactical national football league, and is among the top five European football leagues. Italy&#x27;s club sides have won 48 major European trophies, making them the second most successful nation in European football. Serie A hosts three of the world&#x27;s most famous clubs as Juventus, Milan, and Inter, all founding members of the G-14, a group which represented the largest and most prestigious European football clubs; Serie A was the only league to produce three founding members.

Juventus, Milan, and Inter (the Big Three), along with Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina and historically Parma, but now replaced by Napoli are known as the Seven Sisters of Italian football due to their popular support and dominance in league and cups between the 1990s and 2020s. Italian managers are among the most successful in European football, especially in competitions such as the Champions League. More players have won the coveted &quot;Ballon d&#x27;Or&quot; award while playing in Serie A than any other league in the world after La Liga.

== History ==
=== Ancient times and &quot;calcio fiorentino&quot; ===

Other forms of football were played in Italy in ancient times, the earliest of which was &quot;Harpastum&quot;, played during the times of the Roman Empire. This game may have also been influential in other forms throughout Europe due to the expansion of the Roman Empire, including Medieval football. From the 16th century onwards, &quot;calcio fiorentino&quot;, another code of football distinct from the modern game, was played in the Piazza Santa Croce in Florence. Some famous Florentines were among the players of the game, particularly the Medici family including Piero, Lorenzo, and Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, as well as popes who played the game in the Vatican, such as Clement VII, Leo XI, and Urban VIII. The name &quot;calcio&quot; (&quot;kick&quot;) was later adopted for football in Italy (attested first in 1889, &quot;Il Foot-ball ovvero il Giuoco del Calcio&quot;), becoming the synonym for Italian association football worldwide, as well as the most popular sport in Italy.

=== Italian football is born in Turin and Genoa ===
The modern variation of the game was brought to Italy during the 1880s. Edoardo Bosio, a merchant worker in the British textile industry, had visited England and experienced the game. He returned to Turin in 1887 and was motivated to help spread football in his homeland. He founded the first football club in Italy (Torino Football and Cricket Club) that year, while Nobili Torino (Turin Nobles) soon followed. The second club bore the name noble because it contained Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, and Alfonso Ferrero de Gubernatis Ventimiglia, who would later become president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). The two merged in 1891 to form Internazionale Football Club Torino. Genoa Cricket and Football Club, formed as a cricket club to represent England abroad, was founded by Englishmen in 1893. In 1896, a man named James Richardson Spensley arrived in Genoa and introduced the football section of the club, becoming its first manager.

Some early tournaments were organised by the Italian Gymnastics Federation (FGI, then FGNI) between 1895 and 1897 and until 1913. In 1898, a new federation, the future FIGC but then known as Federazione Italiana del Foot-ball (FIF) until 1909, had been formed, with its centre originally in Turin and the first president as Mario Vicary. The FIGC created the Italian Football Championship with the four founding clubs being; Genoa, Torinese, Ginnastica Torino, and Internazionale Torino. Its first competition, the 1898 Italian Football Championship, was held at the Velodrome Humbert I in Turin on 8 May 1898, and was won by Genoa. While it was common for clubs to compete in both FIGC and FNGI competitions early on, the titles won in the FIGC championship are the only ones officially recognised by the modern-day league. In the following years, the tournament (called Prima Categoria) was structured into regional groups with the winners of each group participating in a playoff with the eventual winners being declared champions. Until 1904, the tournament was dominated by Genoa, who won six titles in seven years. Between 1905 and 1908, a Final Group among regional champions was contested to award the title and the Spensley Cup. Juventus won his first title and Spensley Cup in 1905, while the following two championships were won by Milan.

=== Italianisation and split of the championship ===
In November 1907, the FIF organised two championships in the same season:
#Italian Championship, the main tournament where only Italian players were allowed to play; the winners would be proclaimed &quot;Campioni d&#x27;Italia&quot; (Italian Champions) and would be awarded the Bruni Cup.
#Federal Championship, a secondary tournament where foreign players (if they lived in Italy) were also allowed to play; the winners would be proclaimed &quot;Campioni Federali&quot; (Federal Champions) and would be awarded the Spensley Cup.

The FIF wanted to organise two different championships in order to allow weaker clubs, composed only of Italian players (&quot;squadre pure italiane&quot;, &quot;pure Italian teams&quot;), to win the national title, and to relegate simultaneously the big clubs, composed mostly of stronger foreign players (&quot;squadre spurie internazionali&quot;, &quot;spurious international teams&quot;) in a minor competition for a &quot;consolation prize&quot;. The majority of big clubs (Genoa, Milan, and Torino) withdrew from both the championships in order to protest against the autocratic policy of the FIF. The Federal Championship was won by Juventus against Doria, while the 1908 Italian Championship and the Bruni Cup were won by Pro Vercelli, beating Juventus, Doria, and Milanese. The Federal Championship won by Juventus was later forgotten by FIGC due to the boycott by the dissident clubs. 1908 also saw a scission within Milan that led to the foundation of Inter.

In the 1909 Italian football season, the two different championships were organised again, with the Oberti Cup in lieu of the Spensley Cup for the Federal Championship. This time, the majority of big clubs decided to only withdraw from the Italian Championship in order to make the Federal competition the most relevant tournament and to diminish the Italian one. The Federal Championship was won by Pro Vercelli, beating Milanese in the Final, while the Italian Championship was won by Juventus, again beating Milanese in the Final. Ultimately, the dissenters&#x27; strategy worked out, as the failure of the Italian Championship won by Juventus forced the FIGC to later recognise the Federal Champions of Pro Vercelli as &quot;Campioni d&#x27;Italia 1909&quot;, disavowing the other tournament and depriving Juventus of another title.

The format was modified for the 1909–10 Prima Categoria, which was played in a league format. Nine clubs participated, playing each other both home and away. The split between Federal and Italian championship was not completely abolished because, while unifying these tournaments, it was decided for the last time to assign two titles at the end of the season. In fact, the FIGC established to proclaim as Federal Champions (now turned into the main title) the first-placed club in the general classification, while recognised as Italian Champions (now become the secondary title) would be the best placed club among the four &quot;pure Italian teams&quot;, depending on the head-to-head matches. At the end of the season, Pro Vercelli and Inter finished joint-top, so a playoff was needed in order to assign the Federal title (the Italian one was won by Pro Vercelli). This season was the first victory for Inter, having defeated Pro Vercelli in the final by a score of 10–3. Even the Italian title won by Pro Vercelli was later forgotten.

== National championship ==

A first national competition organised by the Italian Gymnastics Federation (FGNI–FGI) was played in 1896, the same year of the first modern Olympic Games, and won by a team from Udine, an Italian northeast city in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, named Udinese. In 1897, a second national gymnastic-football tournament was won by SG Torinese. In 1898, the Federazione Italiana del Foot-ball (FIF–FIGC) was finally formed and the first national championship was organised, with regional tournaments and playoffs. Held in Turin on the occasion of the International Exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the Albertine Statute, with about one hundred spectators in attendance, it included four clubs, three matches, and lasted a single day. This is considered to be the first proper national football championship and was won using the Pyramid formation (2–3–5) by Genoa, which then went on to win five more championships in six years. &quot;Caffaro&quot;, a newspaper in Genoa, headlined &quot;The Genoese winners of the national championship&quot;, while another reported that the competitors gathered at a restaurant, where they had dinner and the championship cup was delivered to the winning team. To celebrate the event of the first national football championship, Franco Bernini wrote a book in 2005 entitled &quot;La prima volta&quot;.

== National teams ==

The Italy national football team, called &quot;Azzurri&quot; or &quot;squadra azzurra&quot; for their blue shirts, are the third-most successful national team in the World Cup for number of medals. During the 1970s to early 1990s, Italy became famous for their &quot;catenaccio&quot;, thus heralding a long line of world class defenders, such as Virginio Rosetta, Pietro Rava, Carlo Parola, Giacinto Facchetti, Armando Picchi, Gaetano Scirea, Antonio Cabrini, Claudio Gentile, Franco Baresi, Giuseppe Bergomi, Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Nesta, Fabio Cannavaro, Andrea Barzagli, Leonardo Bonucci, and Giorgio Chiellini. Defence is traditionally the best part of Italian teams, and Italian defence is generally considered historically the best in the world. A women&#x27;s team, an under-21 team, an under-20 team, an under-19 team, and an under-17 team also compete. Their honours include:

<doc id="1049847" wikidata="Q7553972" url="?curid=1049847" title="Soft dollar">
<text>The term soft dollars refers to a Wall Street practice, especially in the asset management and securities industries, and means the benefits provided to an asset manager by a broker-dealer as a result of commissions generated from a financial transaction executed by the broker-dealer for client accounts or funds managed by the asset manager. In a soft dollar arrangement, the investment manager directs commissions generated by a client&#x27;s or fund&#x27;s transactions to a broker-dealer or other trading venue. Soft dollars, in contrast to hard dollars (actual cash) which have to be reported, are incorporated into brokerage fees and paid expenses, which may not be reported separately (partly due to the difficulty in their valuation). Most investment managers follow the limitations detailed in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, if soft dollar arrangements are entered into with respect to registered investment companies and pension plans (ERISA and public plans), compliance with Section 28(e) is generally required. However, hedge funds, which are generally not registered, may not be subject to the limitations of Section 28(e) and, thus, in some cases, the fund&#x27;s commissions may be used for the adviser&#x27;s benefit. In situations where fund commissions are used outside of the Section 28(e) safe harbor, full and comprehensive disclosure must be provided to fund investors.

==Background and history==
In the brokerage business, soft dollars have been in use for many years. Prior to May 1, 1975—sometimes referred to as &quot;May Day&quot;—all brokerage firms used a fixed price commission schedule published by the New York Stock Exchange; the schedule was a matrix listing the number of shares in the trade on one axis, the stock&#x27;s price per share on the other axis, and the corresponding commission charge in the cells of the matrix. Because broker/dealers traditionally were required to charge a fixed commission and could not compete by lowering the commission for a trade, they soon began to compete by providing additional services to their institutional clients. In the industry this became known as &quot;bundling&quot; services with commissions.

In the early 1970s, the U.S. government investigated the brokerage industry&#x27;s pricing practices. They concluded the industry was engaged in price fixing. The government told the brokerage industry that, as of May 1, 1975 it would be required to &quot;fully negotiate&quot; brokerage commissions with each client for each trade. As the May 1, 1975 deadline approached the brokerage industry went through several changes in an attempt to restructure itself so it could offer services and negotiate the price of each service separately. In the industry this process was known as &quot;unbundling&quot; and it created the discount-brokerage segment of the industry. At the same time, the brokerage industry lobbied Congress to allow it to continue to include the cost of investment research given to institutional clients as part of the fully negotiated commission. Shortly after May 1, 1975 Congress passed an amendment to Section 28 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 28(e) provides a &quot;safe harbor&quot; for any fiduciary that &quot;pays up&quot; from its fully negotiated commission rate to receive qualifying research or brokerage services from its broker(s).

The Securities and Exchange Commission is responsible for interpreting and enforcing Section 28(e). In Section 28(e) the definition of qualifying services is detailed and explicit, but Section 28(e) is not a rule it is just a &quot;safe harbor&quot;. The use of client commissions to pay for services which are not within the safe harbor of Section 28(e) is not within the safe harbor. A fiduciary who &quot;pays up&quot; in client commissions to receive non-qualifying services must be able to defend this practice under applicable law. For pension plans subject to ERISA, a fiduciary can use client assets only for the exclusive benefit of clients and cannot use the client assets for the fiduciary&#x27;s benefit. Most public pension plans have similar prohibitions. For registered investment companies (such as mutual funds), Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 generally prohibits a fund affiliate—such as the fund adviser—receiving compensation when purchasing or selling property for a registered fund. As a result, for all practical purposes, brokerage arrangements for pension plans and registered investment companies must come within the Section 28(e) safe harbor or run afoul of these restrictions. 
Statistical studies over several recent years and large populations of institutional trade data have revealed that the cost of executing and clearing institutional trades is between 1.25 and 1.65 cents per share. Most institutional advisors pay between 3 and 5 cents per share commissions to their brokers. Many of these institutional fiduciaries provide no disclosure of what &quot;services&quot; they are receiving for the excess over their fully negotiated commission rate. In bundled full service brokerage arrangements this lack of disclosure is particularly problematic because it makes it difficult to apply Section 28(e) tests and measure Section 28(e) compliance.

In 2018, the European Union banned Soft Dollar payments for research, as part of Mifid II.

==Examples==
Lets assume that ABC Capital needs ongoing access to the daily closing prices of certain securities, and receives this data from XYZ Database Services, a subsidiary of XYZ Brokerage. If an outsider would pay $12,000 per year (paid in &quot;hard&quot; cash), yet ABC directs his broker to reduce his commissions that would have been charged to XYZ, then XYZ receives $12,000. &quot;The only one who is out any real money is the broker.&quot;

An example of illegal use of undisclosed soft dollars might be when a mutual fund manager pays commissions to a broker-dealer and in return the broker-dealer provides furniture for the fund adviser&#x27;s use. Likewise, the adviser to a registered mutual fund cannot send brokerage to a wire-house for providing &quot;shelf space&quot; and marketing favoritism for the family of funds. Such brokerage arrangements, where favors are traded in exchange for institutional clients&#x27; excess commissions have been criticized by securities regulators. Full-service brokerage bundled commission arrangements involving the exchange of brokerage firms&#x27; undisclosed proprietary services provided for institutional clients&#x27; brokerage commissions (paid in excess of a fully negotiated execution-only commission rate) can create conflicts of interest. The lack of transparency in these full-service brokerage arrangements may shield abuses from immediate detection.

In soft dollar arrangements, the brokerage commissions are generally higher than they would be for an &quot;execution only&quot; trading relationship, and over time investment performance may suffer by the higher commission cost. Because institutional funds can trade a significant number of shares every day, the soft dollars add up quickly. Over time, investment performance may deteriorate if the soft dollars are not used to purchase research that enhances performance. However, many believe that as long as full disclosure is made, clients will gravitate to managers that use an appropriate mix of soft dollar and other arrangements.

In the US, although soft dollar transactions have incurred a lot of scrutiny lately, the practice is still allowed. 

==Similar terminology==
In Australia, soft dollars are not illegal although they are discouraged and must be disclosed in plain language terms to clients. Many other jurisdictions also regulate soft dollars—sometime called &quot;soft commissions,&quot; including the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland, and France.

In 1977, the &quot;New York Times&quot; used a headline &quot;Soft Dollars and Hard Economics&quot; to refer to a situation it described as a &quot;declining dollar.&quot;
