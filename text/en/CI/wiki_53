<text>Jonathan Paul Losman (born March 12, 1981) is an American football coach and former player who currently serves as the assistant quarterbacks coach at Washington. Losman played professionally as a quarterback for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the Buffalo Bills. He played college football for the Tulane Green Wave and was selected by the Bills in the first round (22nd overall) in the 2004 NFL draft.

Intended to replace Drew Bledsoe as Buffalo&#x27;s franchise quarterback, Losman was plagued with inconsistent play, injuries, and consistent coaching turnover during his stint with the team, and he was eventually replaced by Trent Edwards. Losman&#x27;s Bills career was considered a disappointment due to the fact he was taken in the same round of the draft as Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, and Ben Roethlisberger, who all went on to have successful careers as franchise quarterbacks with their teams.

Upon leaving the Bills, Losman signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives in the upstart United Football League, leading the team to winning the inaugural UFL championship game before finishing out his career with stints with the Oakland Raiders, Seattle Seahawks, and Miami Dolphins.

==College career==
After a notable high school career at Venice High School in Los Angeles, where he earned Parade All-American honors and was rated the No. 3 quarterback in the nation by PrepStar magazine, Losman accepted an athletic scholarship to attend college at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He enrolled early during the spring quarter of 1999, in order to compete for the starting quarterback position. Losman wanted to be named the starting quarterback. However, UCLA informed him that he would not be the starter, and he transferred.

Losman eventually transferred to Tulane University in New Orleans to play for then-head coach Chris Scelfo, who had made a late recruiting run at him just prior to his committing to UCLA.

After sitting out the 1999 season due to NCAA transfer rules, Losman served as the backup quarterback for two seasons behind future NFL 1st round pick Patrick Ramsey. Losman would see spot starter&#x27;s duty in his first two seasons. He passed for 299 yards and 2 touchdowns in his first start against East Carolina during his freshman season. In 2002, his first year as a full-time starter, Losman led the Green Wave to an 8–5 record and a 36–28 victory in the inaugural Hawaii Bowl against the host-team Hawaii Warriors. Following a 3–1 start in the 2003 season, Tulane suffered multiple injuries that depleted its already thin depth on defense, and slumped to a 5–7 finish. Losman completed his collegiate career having completed 570 of 987 passes (57.7 percent) for 6,754 yards, 60 touchdowns, and 27 interceptions. He also ran for 241 yards, with 10 scores on 237 carries.

While at Tulane, he earned a political science degree with a minor in media arts.

==Professional career==
===Buffalo Bills===

====2004====
After the Buffalo Bills selected University of Wisconsin wide receiver Lee Evans with the 13th pick of the 2004 draft, the Bills traded back into the first round by trading their second round pick to the Dallas Cowboys and selected Losman with the 22nd pick in the first round of the NFL Draft. He was the first quarterback to be drafted by the Bills in the first round since 1983, when the team drafted Jim Kelly. Like Kelly, Losman was drafted in a quarterback-rich class, and was the fourth (and final) quarterback taken in the first round that year, following Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, and Ben Roethlisberger.

Losman&#x27;s NFL career got off to a shaky start during his first training camp when teammate Troy Vincent ran into Losman and broke his leg in a freak accident. Losman suffered a broken left fibula, which delayed his development as a rookie. He eventually recovered and saw limited action in the 2004 NFL season, appearing briefly in three games and completing 3-of-5 passes for 32 yards and 1 interception while backing up Drew Bledsoe. Following the Bills&#x27; February 2005 release of Bledsoe, Losman was named the team&#x27;s starting quarterback by head coach Mike Mularkey.

====2005====
In the first game of the 2005 season (Losman&#x27;s first professional start), Losman led the Bills to a 22–7 victory over the Houston Texans. Losman subsequently struggled with his accuracy and, consequently, his confidence; with those struggles followed consecutive Bills losses. This eventually led the Bills to bench Losman in favor of veteran quarterback Kelly Holcomb in the fifth game of the 2005 season. After Holcomb suffered a head injury in the first quarter of the Bills&#x27; Week 10 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Losman returned to the lineup and threw two quick touchdown strikes to Lee Evans, leading the Bills to a 14–3 victory. The Bills went on to lose all but one of their remaining games in 2005 with Holcomb and Losman splitting time under center.

====2006====
The Bills cleaned house during the following off-season, with changes in management and the coaching staff. Marv Levy, the team&#x27;s new general manager and former Bills head coach, and Dick Jauron, the new head coach, planned to have Losman compete for the starting job against Holcomb and free-agent signee Craig Nall. Losman won the job during the preseason.

Losman was considered by many to be a bust until his much-improved 2006 season, in which he threw 19 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 16 games, with 300-yard games against the New York Jets and Houston Texans. Losman led last-minute, fourth quarter scoring drives to beat the Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars. Losman had a 62.5 completion percentage for the season, a record for Buffalo Bill quarterbacks in a full 16-game season. He was rated the 11th best passer in the NFL, with an 84.9 passer rating.

Losman&#x27;s performance over the last half of the 2006 season was greatly improved. However, the offense as a whole was hurt by a below-average rushing attack that created many third down and long situations. After the season, the Bills traded Willis McGahee to the Baltimore Ravens and drafted University of California running back Marshawn Lynch with the 12th overall selection of the 2007 Draft and Fresno State College running back Dwayne Wright in the 4th round.

Losman was also mired behind a sieve-like offensive line for most of the first half of the 2006 season; subsequent personnel changes made during the Bills bye week resulted in improved offensive line play and, consequently, more improved and consistent production from Losman. Following the season, the Bills further bolstered their offensive line in free agency, signing guard Derrick Dockery, right tackle Langston Walker, and guard/center Jason Whittle.

====2007====

The Bills drafted Stanford University quarterback Trent Edwards with the 92nd overall pick in the 2007 NFL draft. Edwards was considered by many to be the 3rd best available quarterback prospect in the draft (behind #1 overall JaMarcus Russell and #22 overall Brady Quinn), but waited until late in the 3rd round prior to the Bills selection. After the draft, statements from both Bills&#x27; coaching staff and management reaffirmed Losman&#x27;s position as the starting quarterback.

For 2007, Buffalo offensive coordinator Steve Fairchild indicated that with the improved offensive line he plans to employ a more wide-open offense utilizing multiple wide receiver sets and taking greater advantage of the running backs in the passing game.

On September 23, Losman suffered a grade one sprain of his left knee in the first series of plays in a game against New England. Losman was hit late after completing a four-yard pass to Marshawn Lynch by New England Patriots nose tackle Vince Wilfork, who was assessed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty.

&quot;It was just a simple swing pass to get an early completion. The guy came in, hit me in the knee,&quot; said Losman, who stayed in the game for two plays &quot;I knew something was wrong from the get-go, but I figured I&#x27;d play a few plays and maybe the pain would go away.&quot;

Losman was out for the next two games and was available for the October 21 home game against the Baltimore Ravens, but Dick Jauron chose to give Edwards the nod, just for the week. Edwards performance impressed Jauron enough that on October 23, Trent Edwards was named the starting quarterback for the Bills, having won 2 of the 3 games he started. Reports surfaced, however, that many players on the team were unhappy about Losman losing his job. The reports continued to allege that team owner Ralph Wilson, Jr. wanted Losman benched so that he could not reach the statistical milestones needed for his bonus.

In an October 28, 2007 game at the New York Jets, Edwards injured his wrist and was replaced by Losman. Losman led the Bills on two consecutive scoring drives, including one that ended with an 85-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans. Starting the next game for injured Trent Edwards, Losman threw for almost 300 yards and one touchdown to lead the Bills to a win. He started three more games before being benched again for Edwards.

At the end of the season, Losman was upset about losing his job to Edwards and wanted to be traded, but said he would play out the season if necessary.

====2008====
Though he wanted to be traded, Losman continued playing for the Bills in 2008, filling in for an injured Trent Edwards intermittently throughout the season with limited success. The team did not win a game with Losman as the starter, including a game in which he lost a fumble to the New York Jets defense that resulted in the Jets&#x27; game-winning touchdown.

Losman&#x27;s contract expired at the end of the 2008 season and the Bills made no effort to keep him, instead replacing him with Ryan Fitzpatrick.

Looking back at Losman&#x27;s stint with Buffalo, former Bills vice president of player personnel John Guy was quoted as saying &quot;J.P. never had a fair chance. I&#x27;ll never forget his first day of practice and they were blitzing him every which way. I remember saying, &#x27;This isn&#x27;t the way to break in a quarterback.&#x27;&quot; In his five-year stint with the team, Losman had three different offensive coordinators.

===Las Vegas Locomotives===
Losman was signed by the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League (UFL). He signed with the Locomotives on July 21, 2009. On November 27, 2009, he helped the Locomotives win the inaugural UFL Championship. Losman recorded 9 touchdowns and two interceptions on 1,193 passing yards for the Locomotives in 2009.

Losman worked out for the Indianapolis Colts on December 4, 2009, after their backup quarterback Jim Sorgi was injured in practice.

===Oakland Raiders===
With injury to starting quarterback Bruce Gradkowski, the Oakland Raiders signed Losman on December 15, 2009.

Losman made his first Oakland, California appearance against the Denver Broncos on December 20, 2009, throwing one incomplete pass after both quarterbacks Charlie Frye and JaMarcus Russell suffered injuries and had to leave the game.

===Seattle Seahawks===
On May 18, 2010, Losman signed with the Seattle Seahawks. He was released on September 4. On November 10, 2010, Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll reported on Sirius Radio that the Seahawks had signed Losman again. Losman participated in the January 8, 2011, playoff game between the Seahawks and the New Orleans Saints.

===Miami Dolphins===
The Miami Dolphins signed Losman on October 25, 2011. On December 11, he came in for injured quarterback Matt Moore in the third quarter. Losman retired after the end of the season.

==Coaching career==
Following his NFL career, Losman became a volunteer coach with the New Canaan High School football team after settling with his family in the Connecticut suburbs of New York City. His wife encouraged him to pursue a full-time coaching career after two years.

In 2017, Losman joined Clemson as a coaching intern. He eventually became an offensive coach, and in March 2019, while taking part in throwing drills at Clemson&#x27;s Pro Day, was asked by an NFL scout if he would consider returning to the league despite not having played since 2011; Losman declined.

In 2022, Losman was hired as a Player Personnel and Football Administration Assistant at the University of Oklahoma.

<text>Manfred Joshua Sakel (June 6, 1900 – December 2, 1957) was an Austrian-Jewish (later Austrian-American) neurophysiologist and psychiatrist, credited with developing insulin shock therapy in 1927.

==Biography==
Sakel was born on June 6, 1900, in Nadvirna (Nadwórna), in the former Austria-Hungary Empire (now Ukraine), which was part of Poland between the world wars. Sakel studied Medicine at the University of Vienna from 1919 to 1925, specializing in neurology and neuropsychiatry. From 1927 until 1933 Sakel worked in hospitals in Berlin. In 1933 he became a researcher for the University of Vienna&#x27;s Neuropsychiatric Clinic. In 1936, after receiving an invitation from Frederick Parsons, a commissioner of mental hygiene, he chose to emigrate from Austria to the United States of America. In the USA, he became an attending physician and researcher at the Harlem Valley State Hospital.

Dr. Sakel was the developer of insulin shock therapy from 1927 while a young doctor in Vienna, starting to practice it in 1933. It would become used widely for individuals with schizophrenia and other mental patients. He noted that insulin-induced coma and convulsions, due to the low level of glucose attained in the blood (hypoglycemic crisis), had a short-term appearance of changing the mental state of drug addicts and psychotics, sometimes dramatically. He reported that as many as 88% of his patients improved with insulin shock therapy, but most other people reported more mixed results and it was shown eventually that patient selection had been biased and that it didn&#x27;t really have any specific benefits and had many risks, adverse effects and fatalities. However, his method was used for many years in mental institutions worldwide. In the USA and other countries it was discontinued gradually after the introduction of the electroconvulsive therapy during the 1940s and the first neuroleptic drugs during the 1950s.

Dr. Sakel died from heart failure on December 2, 1957, in New York City, NY, USA.

<text>The .45 Schofield / 11.5x27mmR, also referred to as .45 Smith &amp; Wesson is a revolver cartridge developed by Smith &amp; Wesson for their S&amp;W Model 3 Schofield top-break revolver. It is similar to the .45 Colt cartridge, but with a shorter case and a larger rim. The. 45 Schofield will generally work in revolvers chambered for that cartridge; but the reverse is not true, since the .45 Colt case is longer. United States government arsenals supplied .45 Schofield cartridges for the Schofield revolver and the Colt Army revolver to help simplify their armament needs.

==History==
This cartridge was originally designed as a black powder round. The Schofield revolver (a variant of the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3) was patented in the USA on 20 June 1871 and 22 April 1873 by Smith &amp; Wesson. It was a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3 that was modified, due to a suggestion by Major George Schofield, to make it easier for a cavalryman to reload while riding. While the Colt 45 had more power, the speed at which a cavalryman could reload a Schofield was less than 30 seconds, half of the time for a Colt 45. By 1879, the U. S. Army had purchased 8,285 of the revolvers. Due to its reduced power and recoil compared to the Colt .45, it was easier to shoot accurately, yet still retained effective stopping power on the battlefield. It became the standard cartridge of the Army, though the Colt 1873 still was the main issue side arm of the Army.

The .45 Schofield cartridge was shorter than the .45 Colt. It could be used in both the Schofield and the Colt 45 Peacemaker, but the .45 Colt was too long to use in the Schofield. As a result, by the late 1880s the army finally standardized on a .45 cartridge designed to fire in both revolvers, the M1887 Military Ball Cartridge. The M1887 was made at Frankford Arsenal, and was issued only to the military. It had the shorter case of the Schofield and the reduced rim of the Colt round; as it was short enough to fit the Schofield, and its rim was not needed for the rod-ejector Single Action Army, the M1887 would fire and eject from both revolvers.

The Schofield was quite a popular handgun in the old west, and may have been used by General Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. The effectiveness of the cartridge in battle, and its reputation for shootability and accuracy, led to the duplication of the cartridges&#x27; characteristics in the .45 ACP, which would be later chambered in Colt&#x27;s M1911 pistol.

In the early 1880s the Benet type (internal) cartridge primer was retired and the modern Boxer type (external) primer was adopted for all future military production of revolver ammunition.

<text>Neurotrophins are a family of proteins that induce the survival, development, and function of neurons.

They belong to a class of growth factors, secreted proteins that can signal particular cells to survive, differentiate, or grow. Growth factors such as neurotrophins that promote the survival of neurons are known as neurotrophic factors. Neurotrophic factors are secreted by target tissue and act by preventing the associated neuron from initiating programmed cell death – allowing the neurons to survive. Neurotrophins also induce differentiation of progenitor cells, to &quot;form&quot; neurons.

Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain (for example, the hippocampus) retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells, a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are chemicals that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis.

==Terminology==
According to the United States National Library of Medicine&#x27;s medical subject headings, the term &quot;neurotrophin&quot; may be used as a synonym for &quot;neurotrophic factor&quot;, but the term &quot;neurotrophin&quot; is more generally reserved for four structurally related factors: nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). The term &quot;neurotrophic factor&quot; generally refers to these four neurotrophins, the GDNF family of ligands, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), among other biomolecules. Neurotrophin-6 and neurotrophin-7 also exist, but are only found in zebrafish.

== Function ==

During the development of the vertebrate nervous system, many neurons become redundant (because they have died, failed to connect to target cells, etc.) and are eliminated. At the same time, developing neurons send out axon outgrowths that contact their target cells. Such cells control their degree of innervation (the number of axon connections) by the secretion of various specific neurotrophic factors that are essential for neuron survival. One of these is nerve growth factor (NGF or beta-NGF), a vertebrate protein that stimulates division and differentiation of sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons. NGF is mostly found outside the central nervous system (CNS), but slight traces have been detected in adult CNS tissues, although a physiological role for this is unknown. It has also been found in several snake venoms.

In the peripheral and central neurons, neurotrophins are important regulators for survival, differentiation, and maintenance of nerve cells. They are small proteins that secrete into the nervous system to help keep nerve cells alive. There are two distinct classes of glycosylated receptors that can bind to neurotrophins. These two proteins are p75 (NTR), which binds to all neurotrophins, and subtypes of Trk, which are each specific for different neurotrophins. The reported structure above is a 2.6 Å-resolution crystal structure of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) complexed to the ectodomain of glycosylated p75 (NRT), forming a symmetrical crystal structure. 

==Receptors==
There are two classes of receptors for neurotrophins: p75 and the &quot;Trk&quot; family of Tyrosine kinases receptors.

==Types==

===Nerve growth factor===

Nerve growth factor (NGF), the prototypical growth factor, is a protein secreted by a neuron&#x27;s target cell. NGF is critical for the survival and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons. NGF is released from the target cells, binds to and activates its high affinity receptor TrkA on the neuron, and is internalized into the responsive neuron. The NGF/TrkA complex is subsequently trafficked back to the neuron&#x27;s cell body. This movement of NGF from axon tip to soma is thought to be involved in the long-distance signaling of neurons.

===Brain-derived neurotrophic factor===

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor found originally in the brain, but also found in the periphery. To be specific, it is a protein that has activity on certain neurons of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system; it helps to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses through axonal and dendritic sprouting. In the brain, it is active in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and basal forebrain – areas vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking. BDNF was the second neurotrophic factor to be characterized, after NGF and before neurotrophin-3. 

BDNF is one of the most active substances to stimulate neurogenesis. Mice born without the ability to make BDNF suffer developmental defects in the brain and sensory nervous system, and usually die soon after birth, suggesting that BDNF plays an important role in normal neural development. 

Despite its name, BDNF is actually found in a range of tissue and cell types, not just the brain. Expression can be seen in the retina, the CNS, motor neurons, the kidneys, and the prostate. Exercise has been shown to increase the amount of BDNF and therefore serve as a vehicle for neuroplasticity.

=== Neurotrophin-3 ===

Neurotrophin-3, or NT-3, is a neurotrophic factor, in the NGF-family of neurotrophins. It is a protein growth factor that has activity on certain neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system; it helps to support the survival and differentiation of existing neurons, and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. NT-3 is the third neurotrophic factor to be characterized, after NGF and BDNF. 

NT-3 is unique among the neurotrophins in the number of neurons it has potential to stimulate, given its ability to activate two of the receptor tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors (TrkC and TrkB). Mice born without the ability to make NT-3 have loss of proprioceptive and subsets of mechanoreceptive sensory neurons. 

===Neurotrophin-4===

Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) is a neurotrophic factor that signals predominantly through the TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase. It is also known as NT4, NT5, NTF4, and NT-4/5.

===DHEA and DHEA sulfate===

The endogenous steroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester, DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), have been identified as small-molecule agonists of the TrkA and p75NTR with high affinity (around 5 nM), and hence as so-called &quot;microneurotrophins&quot;. DHEA has also been found to bind to the TrkB and TrkC, though while it activated the TrkC, it was unable to activate the TrkB. It has been proposed that DHEA may have been the ancestral ligand of the Trk receptors early on in the evolution of the nervous system, eventually being superseded by the polypeptide neurotrophins.

==Role in programmed cell death==
During neuron development neurotrophins play a key role in growth, differentiation, and survival. They also play an important role in the apoptotic programmed cell death (PCD) of neurons. Neurotrophic survival signals in neurons are mediated by the high-affinity binding of neurotrophins to their respective Trk receptor. In turn, a majority of neuronal apoptotic signals are mediated by neurotrophins binding to the p75NTR. The PCD which occurs during brain development is responsible for the loss of a majority of neuroblasts and differentiating neurons. It is necessary because during development there is a massive over production of neurons which must be killed off to attain optimal function.

In the development of both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS) the p75NTR-neurotrophin binding activates multiple intracellular pathways which are important in regulating apoptosis. Proneurotrophins (proNTs) are neurotrophins which are released as biologically active uncleaved pro-peptides. Unlike mature neurotrophins which bind to the p75NTR with a low affinity, proNTs preferentially bind to the p75NTR with high affinity. The p75NTR contains a death domain on its cytoplasmic tail which when cleaved activates an apoptotic pathway. The binding of a proNT (proNGF or proBDNF) to p75NTR and its sortilin co-receptor (which binds the pro-domain of proNTs) causes a p75NTR-dependent signal transduction cascade. The cleaved death domain of p75NTR activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The activated JNK translocates into the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and transactivates c-Jun. The transactivation of c-Jun results in the transcription of pro-apoptotic factors TFF-a, Fas-L and Bak. The importance of sortilin in p75NTR-mediated apoptosis is exhibited by the fact that the inhibition of sortilin expression in neurons expressing p75NTR suppresses proNGF-mediated apoptosis, and the prevention of proBDNF binding to p75NTR and sortilin abolished apoptotic action. Activation of p75NTR-mediated apoptosis is much more effective in the absence of Trk receptors due to the fact that activated Trk receptors suppress the JNK cascade.

The expression of TrkA or TrkC receptors in the absence of neurotrophins can lead to apoptosis, but the mechanism is poorly understood. The addition of NGF (for TrkA) or NT-3 (for TrkC) prevents this apoptosis. For this reason TrkA and TrkC are referred to as dependence receptors, because whether they induce apoptosis or survival is dependent on the presence of neurotrophins. The expression of TrkB, which is found mainly in the CNS, does not cause apoptosis. This is thought to be because it is differentially located in the cell membrane while TrkA and TrkC are co-localized with p75NTR in lipid rafts.

In the PNS (where NGF, NT-3 and NT-4 are mainly secreted) cell fate is determined by a single growth factor (i.e. neurotrophins). However, in the CNS (where BDNF is mainly secreted in the spinal cord, substantia nigra, amygdala, hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus and cortex) more factors determine cell fate, including neural activity and neurotransmitter input. Neurotrophins in the CNS have also been shown to play a more important role in neural cell differentiation and function rather than survival. For these reasons, compared to neurons in the PNS, neurons of the CNS are less sensitive to the absence of a single neurotrophin or neurotrophin receptor during development; with the exception being neurons in the thalamus and substantia nigra.

Gene knockout experiments were conducted to identify the neuronal populations in both the PNS and CNS that were affected by the loss of different neurotrophins during development and the extent to which these populations were affected. These knockout experiments resulted in the loss of several neuron populations including the retina, cholinergic brainstem and the spinal cord. It was found that NGF-knockout mice had losses of a majority of their dorsal root ganglia (DRG), trigeminal ganglia and superior cervical ganglia. The of these mice was poor. The BDNF-knockout mice had losses of a majority of their vestibular ganglia and moderate losses of their DRG, trigeminal ganglia, nodose petrosal ganglia and cochlear ganglia. In addition they also had minor losses of their facial motoneurons located in the CNS. The viability of these mice was moderate. The NT-4-knockout mice had moderate losses of their nodose petrosal ganglia and minor losses of their DRG, trigeminal ganglia and vestibular ganglia. The NT-4-knockout mice also had minor losses of facial motoneurons. These mice were very viable. The NT-3 knockout mice had losses of a majority of their DRG, trigeminal ganglia, cochlear ganglia and superior cervical ganglia and moderate losses of nodose petrosal ganglia and vestibular ganglia. In addition the NT-3-knockout mice had moderate losses of spinal moroneurons. These mice had very poor viability. These results show that the absence of different neurotrophins result in losses of different neuron populations (mainly in the PNS). Furthermore, the absence of the neurotrophin survival signal leads to apoptosis.

<doc id="1061579" wikidata="Q983529" url="?curid=1061579" title="Mongaguá">
<text>Mongaguá is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Baixada Santista. The population is 57,648 (2020 est.) in an area of 141.87 km2. The name comes from the Tupi language. Its seal carries the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;.

The municipality&#x27;s street plan is on a planned grid running from SSE to NNW and many of the houses are within sight of the Atlantic Ocean. The populated area of Mongaguá is near the bottom of steep-sloping and densely forested mountains. The BR-101 superhighway linking Santos and the southern part of the state runs through Mongaguá. The freeway to the city of São Paulo is also easily accessible. Housing developments near the beaches were built in the 1970s and the 1990s. Prior to the construction of the housing developments, the population was mainly rural. Housing development continues to this day.

There are two aboriginal villages in Mongaguá: Aldeia Itaóca and Aguapéu, located in the Atlantic Mata reserve. The aboriginal community of Aguapéu conceived of the project &quot;Jaguatareí Nhemboé&quot; (Walking and Learning).

==History==
===Pre-colonial era===
Around the year 1000, the region was invaded by Tupi peoples from the Amazon. They expelled the previous inhabitants, called Tapuias, to the interior of the continent. When the first Europeans arrived in the region in the 16th century, the Guaranis lived on the banks of the Mongaguá and Aguapeú rivers.

==Population history==
==Mongaguá Fishing Pier==
The concrete Mongaguá Fishing Pier (or Plataforma de Pesca Amadora de Mongaguá) is a long T-shaped structure that provides access to line fishing as well as being a popular surfing area.

==Media==
In telecommunications, the city was served by the Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Notable residents==
Raul Seixas, the &quot;Father of Brazilian Rock&quot;, was known to spend large amounts of time in Bairro Pedreira in Mongaguá where for years he rented a small bungalo as a songwriting studio. And since 2010, the Greek-Californian artist and musician Ithaka Darin Pappas has worked and resided in Mongaguá at his small art ranch called Recanto Akahti (or AkahtiLândia, Brazil). His insect-inspired photo and sculpture works from the project Aliens Of AkahtiLândia were all created in Mongaguá as well as the recording of his instrumental album, Voiceless Blue Raven, which included a song entitled &quot;Monday In Mongaguá.&quot;

<doc id="1061580" wikidata="Q15516987" url="?curid=1061580" title="John T. Biggers">
<text>John Thomas Biggers (April 13, 1924 – January 25, 2001) was an African-American muralist who came to prominence after the Harlem Renaissance and toward the end of World War II. Biggers created works critical of racial and economic injustice. He also served as the founding chairman of the art department at Houston&#x27;s Texas State University for Negroes (now Texas Southern University), a historically black college.

== Early life and education ==
Biggers was born in a shotgun house built by his father in Gastonia, North Carolina. His father Paul was a Baptist preacher, farmer, shoemaker, schoolteacher, and principal of a three-room school. His mother Cora was a housekeeper for white families. As the youngest of seven, Biggers was reared in a close family that valued creativity and education.

When Bigger&#x27;s father died in 1937, his mother took a job in an orphanage for Black children. His mother also sent John and his brother Joe to Lincoln Academy, an American Missionary Association school for African-American children in Kings Mountain, North Carolina.

After graduating from Lincoln, Biggers attended Hampton Institute (now Hampton University), a historically black college. Biggers planned to become a plumber (his Hampton application included boiler room drawings). His life took a dramatic change of course when he took an art class with Viktor Lowenfeld, a Jewish refugee who in 1939 had fled from Nazi persecution in Austria before World War II. Lowenfield introduced his students to works by African Americans and helped them understand the religious and social context of African art, of which the Hampton Museum had a significant collection.

Afterward, Biggers began to study art. At Hampton, Biggers also studied under African-American painter Charles White and sculptor Elizabeth Catlett. He also began to learn the work of Mexican muralists Jose Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Diego Rivera; and American regionalists Grant Wood, Reginald Marsh, Thomas Hart Benton, and Harry Sternberg. He was exposed to and influenced by Harlem Renaissance artists William Artis and Hale Woodruf, and writers W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke.

In 1943, Biggers was drafted and joined the U.S. Navy, which was segregated, like the other armed services. He remained stationed at the Hampton Institute and made models of military equipment for training purposes. In that same year, his talents were recognized when his work was included in a landmark exhibit &quot;Young Negro Art&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Biggers was discharged in 1945.

== Education and career ==
In 1946, Biggers enrolled at Pennsylvania State University when Lowenfeld persuaded him to follow. He earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in art education in 1948. In that same year, he married Hazel Hales. He earned a doctorate from Pennsylvania State in 1954. He was awarded an honorary doctor of letters degree from Hampton University in 1990.

His works can be found at Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia, primarily in the campus library. The University Museum at Houston&#x27;s Texas Southern University houses a collection of Biggers&#x27;s works.

Biggers was hired to be founding chairman of the art department in 1949 at Houston&#x27;s Texas State University for Negroes (now Texas Southern University). &quot;Over the next thirty-four years Biggers trained the next generation of African American artists and teachers that form a vital part of Biggers&#x27;s legacy.&quot; Mr. Biggers retired from Texas Southern University in 1983. He lived at 3527 Ruth Street while he taught at TSU.

In 1950, Biggers won first prize for his painting &quot;The Cradle&quot; at the annual exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. &quot;Segregationist policies, however, allowed black visitors into the museum only on Thursdays, so he could not attend the show&#x27;s opening.&quot;

From 1950 to 1956 Biggers painted four murals in African-American communities in Texas, the beginning of his work in murals. He painted many public murals in Houston and elsewhere, including two in 1991 for Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina. Most are still in place.

Biggers received a mural commission by the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association of Houston in 1952, for the Blue Triangle branch. Thinking of the YWCA as a place for African-American girls and women to be empowered, Biggers was inspired to draw from his mural for his doctoral thesis. His mural was titled &quot;The Contribution of the Negro Woman to American Life and Education&quot;. Biggers wanted the mural to represent the world of the girls and women who would see it.

It honors the sacrifices and endeavors of African American women on behalf of their families and communities, and human rights for women of all races. The mural was revolutionary, symbolizing the sociological, historical, and educational influences of heroic women.

== UNESCO fellowship ==
Biggers received a fellowship in 1957 from UNESCO, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. With it, he was one of the first African-American artists to visit Africa. Under the auspices of UNESCO, he and his wife Hazel traveled to Ghana, Benin, Nigeria and Togo to study West African cultural traditions first-hand. Biggers described his trip to Ghana and Nigeria as a &quot;positive shock&quot; and as &quot;the most significant of my life&#x27;s experiences.&quot;

He adopted African design motifs and scenes of life from his travels as important elements of his subsequent work. Biggers returned to Africa again in 1969, 1984 and 1987. In a 1975 Houston Oral History Project interview, Biggers spoke of his experiences. &quot;We spent most of our time in the country. People call it &quot;bush,&quot; you know, that&#x27;s a name sort of like the hunter. I don&#x27;t care for that name for the country people because country people have a great traditional culture. And these cultures are all over the country. They are beautiful. They have endured.&quot;

Biggers credits Lowenfeld with influencing his artistic development, giving him a larger perspective on the anguish that people have suffered because of race or religious beliefs. He died at age 76 in Houston.

== Career ==

When Biggers studied African myths and legends, he was particularly drawn to the creation stories of a matriarchal deistic system, contrasting with the patriarchal images of the European world. As his ideas and images of Africa melded with memories of his rural Southern life, his work became more geometric, stylized and symbolic. He used quilt-like geometric patterning as a unifying element of his work and made his colors richer and lighter. In later years, Biggers shifted from creating works that were overtly critical of racial and economic injustice (&quot;Victim of the City Streets #2&quot;, 1946) to more allegorical works (&quot;Birth from the Sea&quot;, 1964 and &quot;Shotguns: Third Ward&quot;, 1987).

Robert Farris Thompson notes how Biggers gives iconic treatment to household items associated with everyday domestic life. For instance, he portrays the shotgun house as a symbol of collective dignity and cultural identity. The recurring symbol of the simple shotgun with a woman standing on the porch can be interpreted not only as the simplest type of housing but also as a reference to women, through whom all creation comes. He uses a repeated triangular roof shape similar to pieces of a quilt, a reference to making a beautiful whole cloth from many irregular pieces, as another symbol of the creative force.

In 1994, Biggers illustrated Maya Angelou&#x27;s poem &quot;Our Grandmothers&quot;.

In 1995, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston hosted a retrospective exhibition of Biggers&#x27;s work titled &quot;The Art of John Biggers: View from the Upper Room.&quot; The show also traveled to Boston, Hartford, Connecticut, and Raleigh, North Carolina. &quot;He is someone who has retained, over 50 years, an emphasis on African-American culture,&quot; said Alvia J. Wardlaw, curator of the exhibition, a recognized author on African American Art, and professor and curator of Texas Southern University&#x27;s Museum. The catalogue Wardlaw created for the retrospective, &quot;The Art of John Biggers: View from the Upper Room&quot; (published by Harry N. Abrams in 1995)&quot;,&quot; includes a broad selection of Biggers&#x27;s paintings, drawings, prints, and sculptures.

In 1996 Biggers was invited to create the original design for the &quot;Celebration of Life&quot; mural in North Minneapolis, a predominantly African-American community. The mural was completed by a number of local Minnesota artists, including a few of considerable reputation such as Seitu Jones and Ta-coumba Aiken. Due to the creation of a new housing development, the mural was taken down in 2001.

In 2016, The Mint Museum in Charlotte, N.C., opened a multi-year exhibit &quot;John Biggers: Wheels in Wheels&quot;, which includes 12 important paintings, drawings and prints, as well as a rare example of the artist&#x27;s sculpture. &quot;Through the use of a rich symbolic language and beautiful craftsmanship, Biggers found connections between personal, familial, and regional histories, traditions, symbols, which he wove together to articulate broader cultural and historical concerns,&quot; the exhibit promotion stated. Themes that repeat throughout his career - the importance of women, family and triumph over adversity - are evident in the works on display.

==Auction records==

On October 8, 2009, Swann Galleries set an auction record for any work by Biggers when they sold the painting &quot;Shotguns&quot; (1987), acrylic and oil on canvas, for $216,000 in a sale of African-American fine art. A stellar representation of the shotgun-style houses found in Southern black communities, the painting had been widely exhibited and was considered a culmination of Biggers&#x27;s work. It had remained in a private collection since being acquired directly from the artist in 1987.

Biggers&#x27;s papers, including correspondence, photographs, printed materials, professional materials, subject files, writings, and audiovisual materials documenting his work as an artist and educator are located at Emory University&#x27;s Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library in Atlanta, Georgia. His works are in such collections as noted below.

<text>Li Su (died June 192) was a Chinese military officer serving under the warlords Dong Zhuo and Lü Bu during the Eastern Han dynasty of China.

== Biography ==
Li Su was from Wuyuan Commandery (五原郡), which was around present-day Baotou, Inner Mongolia. He served as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉) under Dong Zhuo, the warlord who controlled the Han central government and figurehead Emperor Xian between 189 and 192.

In May 192, Li Su joined Lü Bu and Wang Yun in a plot to assassinate Dong Zhuo in Chang&#x27;an. He led about a dozen soldiers and pretended to stand guard near the entrance. When Dong Zhuo arrived, Li Su tried to stab him with a &quot;ji&quot;, but Dong Zhuo&#x27;s body armour saved him. Lü Bu then came up close and killed Dong Zhuo.

Later in 192, Lü Bu ordered Li Su to lead troops to attack and kill Niu Fu, Dong Zhuo&#x27;s son-in-law. However, Niu Fu defeated Li Su in battle and forced him to retreat to Hongnong Commandery (弘農郡; south of present-day Lingbao City, Henan), where Lü Bu had him executed for his failure.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Li Su was also credited with persuading Lü Bu to kill his adoptive father Ding Yuan and join Dong Zhuo. Among the many gifts Li Su brought along with him when he visited Lü Bu, the most outstanding one was the horse called the Red Hare.

<text>David Clennon (born May 10, 1943) is an American actor. He is known for his portrayal of Miles Drentell in the ABC series &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; and &quot;Once and Again&quot;, as well as his role as Palmer in the John Carpenter film &quot;The Thing&quot;. He has been frequently cast in films directed by Hal Ashby, Costa-Gavras and Jordan Walker-Pearlman.

==Life and career==
Born in Waukegan, Illinois, the son of Virginia, a homemaker, and Cecil Clennon, an accountant, Clennon attended the University of Notre Dame from 1962 to 1965. He studied at the Yale School of Drama for three years and became a member of their professional acting company. In 1996 he married Perry Adleman, a writer, camera assistant and photographer. They have two children. 

In 1980, Clennon provided the voice for Admiral Motti in NPR&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars The Original Radio Drama&quot;. He was a regular on the TV shows &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, &quot;Almost Perfect&quot;, &quot;The Agency,&quot; and &quot;Saved&quot;. Clennon also played Carl Sessick (a.k.a. Carl the Watcher) on &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; and appeared on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as Dr. Crell Moset. In 1993 he won an Emmy award for his guest appearance on the series &quot;Dream On&quot;.

Clennon often performs at New Haven, Connecticut&#x27;s Long Wharf Theatre.

==Political activism==
Clennon staunchly opposed the Vietnam War, often participating in protests, and remains politically active. In 2013, he repeatedly spoke out against the film &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot; and refused to vote for it for an Academy Award, stating that it promoted using torture as acceptable.

In 2018, he opposed the four Emmy nominations for Ken Burns&#x27;s documentary program &quot;The Vietnam War&quot;, feeling that it contained &quot;half-truths, distortions and omissions&quot; about the war.

<text>Giuseppe Maria Gioacchino Cambini (Montelupo Fiorentino, 8 april 1746Netherlands? 1810s? or Paris? 1825?) was an Italian composer and violinist.

==Life==
===Unconfirmed information===
Information about his life is scarcely traceable. Louis-Gabriel Michaud, French scholar and François-Joseph Fétis, Belgian musicologist, drafted his biography, and Cambini himself speaks about his past in an article published in &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; in 1804. However, all of these documents are full of errors and, therefore, need to be verified. It is not possible to confirm his personal data (only Fétis indicates his date of birth), nor his first studies. It is possible he is connected in some way to father Giovanni Battista Martini, and, more possibly to Filippo Manfredi, who was almost certainly his violin teacher. Fétis wrote about his unfortunate operatic debut in Naples in 1766, after which, during his return to Livorno by the sea, Cambini was kidnapped by pirates, who treated him terribly until his liberation by a Venetian aristocrat. The narration by the Belgian holds much resemblance to a story in the poetic periodical &quot;Correspondance littéraire, philosophique et critique&quot;, a fact that reduces its reliability. In the article found in &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; in 1804, Cambini claims to have played the viola in a string quartet with Luigi Boccherini, Pietro Nardini and his teacher Manfredi for six months in 1767. If what he says is true, this quartet would represent the first formation of this emerging genre in Italy, if not in all of Europe. For many years, this information fostered a gigantic legend about the importance of the role of Cambini in defining the string quartet. Actually, he was one of the many (even if one of the most prolific) who, in the same period, contributed to the development of the genre.

===First years in Paris===
The first information that we have that is certain is his arrival in Paris at the beginning of the 1770s, where he remained for 20 years, and composed oratorios, concert compositions, as well as chamber, symphonic, and theatrical compositions (there are almost 14 operas, of which at least 12 were performed in Paris. In addition, there are some ballets that aroused the admiration of Christoph Willibald Gluck), and he performed his violin concertos (during the &quot;Concert Spirituel&quot; and the &quot;Concerts des Amateurs&quot;, managed by François-Joseph Gossec). More than 600 compositions were published with his name in the French capital until 1800 (above all by the Venier, Berault and Sieber publishers, see also the section &quot;Sources&quot;), of which more than 80 are &quot;symphonies concertante&quot; (he wrote more of these than any other French composer of the time, becoming a champion of the genre).

===Polemic with Mozart===
His success in composing for the &quot;sinfonia concertante&quot; genre inspired the rivalry of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who in 1778 accused Cambini of having obstructed the performance of his Sinfonia Concertante for Four Winds KV 297b at the &quot;Concert Spirituel&quot;, because Cambini was jealous of its perfection. The skepticism with regard to Cambini is not observed from any other composer who dealt with him. Conversely, Gluck, in the same years, often recommended him as an upstanding and honest man. Therefore, it is probable that the Salisburg expressed exaggerated feelings toward Cambini.

===Alternating Parisian fame===
The accusation by Mozart is not especially valid partially because the power of Cambini in Paris did not reach the level that Mozart claimed. In fact, the musical press paid less than gratifying attention to Cambini&#x27;s vast production. He was cited relatively few times in the contemporary critiques, and his career as a violinist is less appreciated than other contemporary soloists of the time. His greatest successes, as aforementioned, were the &quot;sinfonie concertanti&quot; and his quartets, which even Mozart praised. His easy style, attractive and brilliant, open only just enough to innovation, rendered him a sort of protector of the &quot;galant&quot; Parisian style, and many of his pieces were favorably accepted in London as well as in America (some actively participated in defining the so-called &quot;forma sonata&quot;), but his theatrical works, operas, were almost always torn to shreds. Moreover, from 1785 it was affirmed in France of the more complex Viennese style, to which he tried to awkwardly join, undermining his fame, and damaging his reputation in the press of the German area.

===The Revolution===
In 1788, he became manager of the Théâtre Beaujolais, and he worked there during the revolutionary turmoil until 1791. His endurance permitted continuity of a high-quality operatic offering even in the years of the Republic. During the time of the Terror, beginning in 1791, he directed the Théâtre Louvois, which due to the economic crisis caused by the war was forced to close in 1794. The crisis affected many, as well as the estate of Cambini, and it constrained him to find very different work opportunities. Beginning in 1794, he accepted a salary from the chemist and entrepreneur Armand Séguin, for whom he gave private concerts and composed more than 100 quartets. He composed revolutionary and patriotic anthems for the newborn Republic. He taught violin, voice and composition privately. In addition, he transcribed opera arias of other authors for any buyer. He accepted editorial commissions (in 1795, the editor Gavreaux asked him to attend to the reprinting of methods for violin by Francesco Geminiani, and in 1799 Nademann and Lobry hired him to edit one for flute).

===Oblivion===
At the beginning of the 1800s, Cambini signed contracts with periodicals and magazines, including the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Tablettes de Polymne&quot;, which published his articles until 1811. From that moment, Cambini disappears without leaving any trace in any documents. Michaud affirms that he died in Holland in 1818, information that satisfies scholars and has a certain amount of credibility, while Fétis recounts his painful and tragic admission to a mental hospital in Bicêtre, where he was found dead in 1825.

==Sources==
More than 600 works by Cambini are diffused throughout the world. More than 300 are printed editions, 250 are in manuscript copies, and about 100 are proven autographs. We have received only his instrumental music. In fact, only the music of &quot;Le Tuteur avare&quot;, written in collaboration with Pasquale Anfossi in 1787 (today preserved at the Bibliothèque Municipale de Lille) remains of his operas. For many years, there was a symphony that was considered to be his, but in reality it is by Joseph Martin Kraus for Boyer publishers. From 1784 to 1786, the publisher released the work of the then unknown Kraus under the name of the more famous Cambini in order to sell more copies, causing the misunderstanding of attribution, which was not resolved until 1989.

===Autographs===
All 100 known autographs are in the United States of America, at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. and at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

===Manuscripts===
The largest collection of manuscripts of Cambini&#x27;s compositions are found in Prague, in the music history department of the National Czech Museum of Music. Following, in order of the number of preserved copies are: the Benediktinerstift der Bibliothek und Musikarchiv die Seitenstetten in Austria (the majority however are without a date)), the Conservatorio Benedetto Marcello di Venezia (Torrefranca and Correr Collection), and the Biblioteca di Archeologia e Storia dell&#x27;Arte di Palazzo Venezia in Rome (Vessella Collection). Smaller Italian collections are in the Pasini Collections at the Conservatorio Luca Marenzio in Brescia, at the Conservatorio Cherubini of Florence, at the Conservatorio Paganini di Genoa, at the Biblioteca Estense di Mantova, at Casa Verdi in Milan, at the Conservatorio San Pietro a Majella in Naples, and at the Biblioteca Casanatese di Roma (Marefoschi Collection and more). The Musical Documentation Center of Tuscany preserve three manuscripts of single parts of other chamber music compositions in the Venturi Music Collection in Montecatini Terme. Cities around the world that preserve at least five manuscripts are: Basel (Universitätsbibliothek), Cheb (Státní okresní archiv), Keszthely (Helikon Kastélymúzeum Könyvtára), Leutkirch im Allgäu (Fürstlich Waldburg-Zeilsches Archiv), Lille (Bibliothèque Municipale), Lund (Universitetsbiblioteket), New Haven (Music Library at Yale University), Prague (Biblioteca Nazionale Ceca), Steinfurt (Fürst zu Bentheimsche Musikaliensammlung Burgsteinfurt Collection, managed by Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität within the Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek di Münster), Stockholm (Musik- och teaterbiblioteket) and Västerås (Stadsbibliotek).

===Printed editions===
The Conservatoire de Paris and the Bibliothèque Nationale de France are the institutions that preserve the majority of the printed editions during Cambini&#x27;s life, followed by the British Library of London, the Rossijskaja Gosudarstvennaja Biblioteka of Moscow, the Fürst zu Bentheimsche Musikaliensammlung Burgsteinfurt of Steinfurt, the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde of Vienna, the Biblioteca Nacional of Spain, the Kongelige Bibliotek of Copenhagen, the Biblioteca Estense of Modena, and the Biblioteca Nazionale Universitaria of Turin (in the Foà and Giordano collection).

<text>Kilan () is a city in the Central District of Damavand County, Tehran province, Iran.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 3,038 in 913 households. The following census in 2011 counted 2,981 people in 902 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 2,882 people in 927 households.

==Overview==
The name is derived from the Tati tribe of Kailan/Khailan/Gailan who were settled in this region during the Tati period. Only a few still speak Tati language (Iran). The local folklore, however, produces a folk etymology for the now mysterious name as meaning &quot;king&#x27;s place.&quot;

The earliest human settlement near Kilan is the Neolithic site of Qaleh Asgar located about 1.2 km southeast of Kilan. The site was excavated by Enayatolah Amirlou, who assigned it to the Epipaleolithic period. A reexamination of archaeological finds by Fereidoun Biglari showed that the site is Neolithic and dates back to about 8000 years ago.

A remarkably high 75% of the inhabitants of the city have academic degrees.

<doc id="1061612" wikidata="Q6341618" url="?curid=1061612" title="KXTV">
<text>KXTV (channel 10) is a television station in Sacramento, California, United States, affiliated with ABC. Owned by Tegna Inc., the station maintains studios on Broadway, just south of US 50 at the south edge of downtown Sacramento, and its transmitter is located in Walnut Grove, California.

KXTV was the second station built in Sacramento proper, signing on in 1955; it served as Sacramento&#x27;s CBS affiliate for four decades before changing to ABC in 1995. Its early history was dominated by a battle between local newspaper interests and a group of non-broadcasting business owners for the right to operate the channel, which was won by the latter. Owned in turn by Corinthian Broadcasting and Belo before being acquired by Tegna&#x27;s forerunner Gannett in 1999, the station slowly rose to a second place in local news ratings before falling back to third in the late 2000s.

==History==
===A long channel 10 battle===
The first application for channel 10 in Sacramento was filed on May 7, 1948, by the McClatchy Broadcasting Company, owner of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; newspaper and radio stations KFBK and KFBK-FM. The application was put on hold during the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s four-year freeze on television licenses; when the freeze ended, McClatchy refiled for channel 10. By October, the FCC had received eight applications for Sacramento&#x27;s various TV channels, and joining McClatchy in seeking channel 10 was a consortium known as Sacramento Telecasters, Inc. Sacramento Telecasters consisted of mostly private business interests outside of broadcasting. One owner was Robert S. Breuner of the Breuners Home Furnishings chain; his store had sold televisions when San Francisco stations went on the air, only to have many of them returned because San Francisco stations were not sufficiently received in Sacramento. Also present in the consortium was John Schacht, general manager of radio station KMOD in Modesto, California.

The battle between McClatchy and Sacramento Telecasters that ensued was a long and comparatively high-profile hearing. Both groups originally proposed to build a transmitter facility at Pine Hill, east of Sacramento in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. However, the site was owned by the state, and the California Department of Forestry had announced it would only permit one mast to be built at Pine Hill. Where McClatchy expressed concern over the lack of broadcast expertise in most of the ownership, KMOD&#x27;s public service record, and the possibility that the economic interests involved in Sacramento Telecasters might withdraw their advertising from other stations, Sacramento Telecasters contended that McClatchy—with its ownership of newspapers and broadcasting properties covering areas from Bakersfield in the south to Red Bluff in the north—was overly dominant in the region. Each group had selected a site for planned studios: McClatchy would build television facilities next to the new building for &quot;The Bee&quot; at 22nd and Q streets, while Sacramento Telecasters announced it would construct at 30th and L streets.

FCC hearing examiner Thomas Donahue issued his recommendation on November 10, 1953. He found in favor of McClatchy, citing its long record in broadcasting including five years of training personnel in television, though noting that both applications were unobjectionable. Sacramento Telecasters immediately objected to the initial decision, with president William P. Wright telling the Associated Press, &quot;The men in Sacramento Telecasters believe that all seven members of the FCC are entitled to rule on this apparent departure which would prevent any possibility of new blood entering the field of communications, regardless of qualifications.&quot; The next month, the firm filed a 55-page objection and 113 pages of supporting briefs urging the commission to overturn the initial decision, its argument hinging on the question of diversification of media ownership. Sacramento Telecasters received a lift when the FCC&#x27;s broadcast bureau recommended its application over that of McClatchy in April 1955. Its lead attorney, P. W. Valicenti, called the Sacramento Valley &quot;McClatchy land&quot;; McClatchy attorneys countered this characterization, highlighting the presence of 28 non-McClatchy daily newspapers and several other radio stations in town.

On October 4, 1954, the FCC unanimously overturned the initial decision and granted a construction permit to Sacramento Telecasters, which it deemed a newcomer that &quot;warrants a substantial preference&quot; over McClatchy despite the latter&#x27;s public service record with its existing stations. The company then announced it would begin construction on its proposed new station. McClatchy announced it would challenge the decision in federal appeals court, but Telecasters announced it would go ahead with building the station. It did, however, make two modifications to its plans; site availability concerns surrounding Pine Hill led to its replacement with a new site at Logtown, south of El Dorado, and the studios would be built on 7th Avenue. The facility, formerly the headquarters of the California Highway Patrol, was partially rebuilt to house two studios and eight offices.

On March 20, 1955, KBET-TV—promoted as &quot;Your Best Bet in TV&quot;—began broadcasting with an opening program headlined by comedian Johnny Carson and its first night of programs from CBS; it was Sacramento&#x27;s second station and the city&#x27;s first VHF outlet, preceded by KCCC-TV (channel 40). However, for nearly three years after broadcasting began, the station&#x27;s fledgling operation continued to be challenged by McClatchy. In addition to continuing to argue that the FCC was unfair to newspapers in denying its application and looked upon them with a &quot;jaundiced eye&quot;, an argument unanimously rejected by a three-man panel, the newspaper company added a new argument related to its decision to change the transmitter site from Pine Hill to Logtown, which reduced the station&#x27;s coverage area and were a downgrade from the original proposals for both companies. McClatchy found more success in this line of argument; in October 1956, the appeals court ordered the commission to hold hearings on the KBET-TV tower site change. After the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear appeals from McClatchy and from Sacramento Telecasters, a hearing was slated in October.

However, a petition by McClatchy to enlarge the issues to be considered in the tower site hearing such as to force a review of the comparative merits of its original 1952 application alongside that of Sacramento Telecasters was not looked on favorably. As a result, on February 10, 1958, McClatchy announced it would not pursue any further legal action in the case, &quot;reluctantly&quot; discontinuing its battle. The FCC examiner appointed for the tower site hearing then recommended the commission reaffirm the tower site change. McClatchy would eventually succeed at entering the Sacramento/Stockton television market in 1964, when it purchased Stockton station KOVR.

===Corinthian ownership===
In November 1958, after a month of negotiations, Sacramento Telecasters agreed to sell KBET-TV to the Great Western Broadcasting Corporation—a subsidiary of the J. H. Whitney Company of New York City, which operated the Corinthian Broadcasting group of television stations—for $4.55 million. The call sign was changed to KXTV on April 27, 1959. The station moved to its present tower site at the start of 1962, having jointly constructed it with KOVR and KCRA-TV.

The primary event in the early years of Corinthian operation was a strike that began on September 26, 1960, and stretched more than two years. The strike was touched off when management ordered two directors to leave the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA); 10 AFTRA members and another 32 of NABET joined the action. The strike lasted more than two years and featured a secondary boycott of the station led by the unions, leading to the loss of several advertising contracts; at various times, both parties were found to be guilty of unfair labor practices. In a final ruling at the end of 1964, the National Labor Relations Board found that unions were allowed to engage in publicity other than picketing and thus that their actions were protected. This was affirmed in 1966.

Corinthian purchased a studio site at 400 Broadway in downtown Sacramento to relocate KXTV in 1965; the 7th Avenue site was in the path of the proposed Interstate 5 freeway. The station moved on January 15, 1968, and the property was then sold to the state of California. In 1971, Corinthian merged with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a publisher of trade and technical publications and directories.

===Belo ownership and affiliation switch to ABC===

The Corinthian group was sold to the A. H. Belo Corporation in 1984. Belo immediately made significant changes at the station to bolster its sagging ratings and local image. The present Walnut Grove tower was built in 1986.

On March 6, 1995, KXTV switched its affiliation to ABC, in a swap with KOVR-TV, which joined CBS. The affiliation switch was precipitated by Belo including KXTV in a renewal with its two ABC affiliates.

Over Belo&#x27;s 15-year ownership of the station, it moved from third to second place in local news ratings, and the staff was expanded by 30 percent to 175 employees.

===Gannett/Tegna ownership===
In 1999, Belo traded KXTV and $55 million to the Gannett Company in exchange for KVUE, an ABC affiliate in Austin, Texas. The deal allowed Belo to enter the Texas state capital, a market of significant strategic importance to the Dallas-based company, and gave it a presence in two-thirds of Texas TV households. The deal closed in July, and the general manager of KVUE moved to Sacramento to run KXTV.

In 2000, the station constructed the News10 Weather Tower, which was finished by October but first lit on August 24, 2001, owing to the energy crisis in the state at the time. In addition to providing microwave transmission capabilities for the station—which had to trim trees at homes in the Land Park neighborhood prior to its installation—it originally functioned as a weather beacon with lighted LED elements on the top to indicate features of the weather forecast. As a result of the energy crisis, solar panels were installed on the roof to power the facility. In addition to weather, the tower was lit purple after each Sacramento Kings and Sacramento Monarchs win. While no longer lit, the tower still is used for KXTV&#x27;s microwave needs, cellular service, and to broadcast KXTV&#x27;s Sacramento UHF replacement translator.

KXTV became the broadcast television partner of the Kings midway through the 2002–03 season when a dispute erupted between the Kings and KMAX-TV (channel 31), who had been airing the team&#x27;s games since 1988, over special editions of its morning show that the franchise felt traded on the team&#x27;s name without its permission. As with its arrangement with that station, the Kings bought air time from KXTV, produced the telecasts, and sold the advertising; 25 games were telecast on KXTV in the first season. Several Monarchs women&#x27;s basketball games were added in 2005. In 2009, the Kings moved all of their games to Comcast SportsNet (now NBC Sports California).

On June 29, 2015, Gannett&#x27;s broadcasting and digital divisions split from the newspaper division under the Tegna Inc. name. Two months later, the station retired the long-running &quot;News10&quot; moniker to brand as &quot;ABC 10&quot;, primarily to improve its ability to promote entertainment programming.

==Programming==

===News operation===
Local news was instituted from the station&#x27;s beginning, with radio newsman Hank Thornley as the first anchor on KBET-TV, and slowly expanded through the 1960s. Even though at one point in the early 1970s KXTV briefly eclipsed it, the station has spent most of its history a distant second or third to KCRA-TV, the Sacramento area&#x27;s traditional news leader. At times, not even KXTV and KOVR-TV combined could equal KCRA&#x27;s news ratings.

Known under such names as &quot;The Big News&quot;, &quot;Channel 10 News&quot;, &quot;Newservice 10&quot;, and &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;, the &quot;News 10&quot; name was adopted in 1984 with Belo&#x27;s takeover of the station. The 40-person news staff, the smallest in the market at the time, was expanded. Ratings rose and came closer to challenging KCRA. However, between 2006 and 2010, ratings fell, and KOVR surpassed KXTV in morning and early evening news.

In 2022, KXTV and reporter Brandon Rittiman were honored with a Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award for a series on the role electrical utility PG&amp;E played in sparking the Camp Fire in 2018. The station won another in 2025 for &quot;The Wild West of Education&quot;, a news series by reporter Andie Judson over failings and financial improprieties at Highlands Community Charter and Technical Schools.

===Non-news programming===
From the late 1980s to early 1990s, KXTV produced two nationally syndicated magazine programs: &quot;Scratch&quot; (which was aimed at young adults) and &quot;Pulse&quot; (which covered medical news), as well as &quot;Biba&#x27;s Italian Kitchen&quot;, hosted by local restaurateur Biba Caggiano.

===Notable former on-air staff===

* Dana Jacobson (last with ESPN and now with CBS Sports Radio)

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
KXTV began broadcasting its digital signal on UHF channel 61 in 1999. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television; channel 61 was removed from television use as part of the transition, and the digital signal relocated to VHF channel 10.

In 2014, KXTV filed to build a digital replacement translator broadcasting with 15 kW on UHF channel 36, located on the Weather Tower, to improve reception in the immediate Sacramento area. Construction of the translator was completed in October 2018.

Though it does not host any additional subchannels, KXTV is part of Sacramento&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) deployment on KQCA, which began operating in July 2021.

<text>The .32-20 Winchester / 7.94x33mmR, also known as .32 WCF (Winchester center fire), was the first small-game lever-action intermediate cartridge that
Winchester produced. It was initially introduced as a black-powder cartridge in 1882 for small-game, varmint hunting, and deer. Colt produced a single-action revolver chambered for this cartridge a few years later.

The name .32-20 refers to the 32 caliber bullet of and standard black-powder charge of .

==Performance==
This cartridge was sometimes used for deer hunting in the past, and William Lyman, the designer of rifle sights, said of it: &quot;For large game, of course, a .32-20 W.C.F. cartridge is rather small, but it comes nearer to being an all-around cartridge in my opinion than any other.&quot; Many now consider it too light and low-powered for deer and better suited to small game and metallic silhouette. It has a good reputation for accuracy in rifles as well as the few handguns that have been chambered for it. Because of its low power, it destroys very little meat, making it a good hunting round for appropriately sized game, up to about . 
Although it is an inexpensive cartridge to reload, care must be taken by the reloader because of the extremely thin walls of the cartridge case. Energy and pressure levels for handloading are determined based on the strength and condition of the firearm action to be used. Because most firearms chambered for this cartridge are older (e.g. early model Winchester Model 73 and 92 rifles as well as older Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers) factory ammunition usually has reduced pressures from what can be achieved through handloading. Most factory ammunition exhibits ballistics of about and of energy at the muzzle with a bullet from an 18 to 20 inch rifle barrel. The performance characteristics of the cartridge listed in the sidebar should be considered &quot;maximum&quot; performance parameters obtainable, and even then only with a modern weapon designed for higher pressure loads. Factory-type loads - and reloads mimicking factory type loads - are the safe maximum loads for use in older firearms. Few, if any, companies still manufacture firearms in this caliber.

==Daughter cartridges==
The .25-20 Winchester cartridge is simply a necked-down version of the .32-20. In addition, the .218 Bee was created using the .32-20 as its parent cartridge.

The .32-20 cartridge case has been used to create usable ammunition for the Nagant M1895. This is accomplished by removing .01&quot; from the rim thickness and sizing the case in a specific reloading die (Lee Nagant 3 die set). The ammunition produced is functional and easy to reload; however, .32-20 brass does not provide a gas seal as it is not long enough to protrude past the Nagant cylinder. The .32-20 cartridge case can also be used to create 8mm French Ordnance ammunition for use in the Modèle 1892 revolver.

Currently, the .32-20 is used and modified by shooters in the UK and Australia for the .310 Cadet cartridge. Modifications involve length resizing and in most cases reducing the rim thickness. Due to the .310 using a heeled projectile, the neck thickness is not too much of a concern, after first being case length resized to 1.075&quot; (27.3 mm). Most .310 cadet chambered rifles need to have the rim of the .32-20 case reduced from 0.065&quot; to under 0.045&quot; (1.7 mm to 1.14 mm), to allow proper head spacing and operation of rifle. However, in the instance of a lever action .32-20 fitted with a .310 barrel, the rifle will cycle better without the case rim thickness being reduced. As home reloading is the main option for the .310, many shooters play with different case length reduction of the .32-20, anywhere from 0.875&quot; to 1.185&quot; (22.23 mm to 30.10 mm).

<text>The .38-40 Winchester (10.17x33mmR) is actually a .40 caliber (10 mm) intermediate cartridge shooting .401 in (10.2 mm) caliber bullets. The cartridge was introduced by Winchester in 1874 and is derived from their .44-40 Winchester. This cartridge was introduced for rifles, but in its reintroduction for cowboy action shooting it has seen some popularity as a revolver cartridge. It is not particularly well suited to hunting larger game, but it was popular when it was introduced, along with the previous .44-40 Winchester, for deer hunting. It can be used successfully on smaller game animals, and for self-defense. Current loadings are intended for revolvers.

==Design and history==
It is unclear why this cartridge was introduced, as it is very similar to the .44-40 from which it was derived. It has approximately less muzzle energy, and has a muzzle velocity about less than the .44-40. The bullet differs by only .026 inches in bullet diameter and in standard bullet weight from the original .44-40. The goal may have been to reduce recoil while maintaining a similar bullet sectional density. One unusual design element of this cartridge is that factory ammunition was loaded with a different case profile than the standard chamber for this cartridge, factory ammunition having a much longer neck than the standard chamber. Most reloading dies are designed to size fired brass to the chamber specification rather than that of the original factory ammunition case profile.

The renewed interest in this caliber can be explained by the increasing popularity of cowboy action shooting and metallic silhouette shooting. Several single-action revolvers have recently been chambered for this cartridge, including the Ruger Vaquero. Most modern reloading data for this cartridge is found in the handgun section of reloading manuals.

==Performance==
Though introduced as an &quot;all-around&quot; cartridge, traditional sources suggest the .38–40 performs inadequately on deer. Ballistically, commercial &#x27;cowboy&#x27; loads are similar to the much newer .40 S&amp;W, sharing the bullet weight, and similar velocity. A limited number of hunting loads are available commercially, which produce about 25% more muzzle energy than the more common target ammunition.

<text>The .44-40 Winchester (10.8x33mmR), also known as .44 Winchester, .44 WCF (Winchester Center Fire), and .44 Largo (in Spanish-speaking countries), was introduced in 1873 by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. It was the first metallic centerfire cartridge manufactured by Winchester, and was promoted as the standard chambering for the new Winchester Model 1873 rifle. As both a rifle and a handgun caliber, the cartridge soon became widely popular, so much so that the Winchester Model 1873 rifle became known as &quot;The gun that won the West.&quot;

== History ==
When Winchester released the new cartridge, many other firearm companies chambered their guns in the new round. Remington and Marlin released their own rifles and pistols which chambered the round, Colt offered an alternative chambering in its popular Single Action Army revolver in a model known as the Colt Frontier Six-Shooter, and Smith &amp; Wesson began releasing their Smith &amp; Wesson New Model 3 chambered in .44-40. Settlers, lawmen, and cowboys appreciated the convenience of being able to carry a single caliber of ammunition which they could fire in both pistol and rifle. In both law enforcement and hunting usage, the .44-40 became the most popular cartridge in the United States, and to this day has the reputation of killing more deer than any other save the .30-30 Winchester.

The cartridge was originally sold as .44 Winchester. When the Union Metallic Cartridge Co. (UMC) began selling their own version of the cartridge, it adopted the name .44-40 (shorthand for .44 caliber and the standard load at the time of of black powder), as it did not want to offer free advertising for one of its competitors. Over time, the name stuck, and eventually Winchester adopted the .44-40 designation for the round after World War II. Winchester uses the designation &quot;44-40 Winchester&quot; on packaging.

== Technical background ==
The initial standard load for the cartridge was of black powder propelling a round-nose, flat-point bullet at roughly . Winchester catalogues listed velocities of by 1875. In 1886, UMC also began offering a slightly heavier, , bullet at , also with 40 gr of black powder. Winchester soon began to carry the 217-gr loading, as well, but in 1905, UMC discontinued the heavier load.
In 1895, Winchester introduced a cartridge bulk loaded with of DuPont No. 2 smokeless powder and a bullet for , and in 1896, UMC followed suit with a 217-gr bullet at . Soon, both companies were offering the cartridge with lead &quot;metal patched&quot; (i.e. copper-jacketed with lead points), and full metal jacket versions.
Taking advantage of the stronger-action designs of the Winchester model 1892 and the Marlin 1894 lever-action rifles, in 1903, Winchester began offering a higher-performance version of the loading called the Winchester High Velocity (WHV), with a velocity of using a 200-gr copper-jacketed bullet from a barrel length, UMC and Peters Cartridge Company soon introduced equivalents. Over the years, a number of different bullet weights and styles have been offered, including 122, 140, 160, 165, 166, 180, and 217 gr in lead, soft- and hollow-point, full metal case, blanks, and shot shells. The most common current loading is a 200-gr bullet at 1190 ft/s.

By 1942, more modern cartridges had all but eclipsed the .44-40, but it regained some popularity in the 1950s and 1960s when Colt began once again to manufacture the Single Action Army and Frontier. More recently, the .44-40 has had a resurgence due to the popularity of metallic silhouette and cowboy action shooting, which inspired the introduction of a low-velocity gallery load, the heaviest factory bullet ever available for the cartridge.

== In Popular Culture ==
In the television series The Rifleman, actor Chuck Connors&#x27; character Lucas McCain uses a modified Winchester Model 1892 rifle chambered in .44-40 throughout the series. In the TV Series Little House on the Prairie, Season 2 Episode 12, Mr. Edwards buys his son a Winchester Model 1894 chambered in .44-40, although this was an anachronism as this rifle was not manufactured chambered for the .44-40 cartridge at the time depicted in the show.

<text>The .45 Winchester Magnum is a .45 caliber rimless cartridge intended for use in semi-automatic pistols. The cartridge is an externally lengthened .45 ACP with a thicker web to withstand higher operating pressures. The 45 Win Mag is nearly identical in dimensions and loading to the .45 NAACO developed by the North American Arms Corporation for their Brigadier pistol, developed to supply to the Canadian Army after World War II. The army ultimately did not adopt the pistol and its non-NATO standard ammunition.

The cartridge has been primarily used by small game hunters and metallic silhouette shooters.

==Specifications==
Although the .45 Winchester Magnum may be based on the .45 ACP and have the same Rim and Base dimensions, the .45 Winchester Magnum has no parent case. The .45 Winchester Magnum case is redrawn with thicker walls and longer case. The thicker wall dimensions of the .45 Winchester Magnum are designed to accommodate a higher internal pressure (40,000 cup) than that of the .45 ACP (18,000 cup [21,000psi or 140MPa]).

==History==
The .45 Winchester Magnum had been on the drawing board for two years before its introduction, in 1979, by Winchester. The cartridge did not gain much popularity due to the intermittent availability of the Wildey and LAR Grizzly pistols. The cartridge was chambered in the Thompson-Center Contender single shot pistols. The cartridge was also chambered for the Freedom Arms Model 83 single-action revolver via an available optional cylinder.

The .45 Winchester Magnum gained a following among IHMSA competitors as it provided the power and performance necessary to knock down targets at an extended range. The cartridge has been used by handgun hunters and is among the few semi-automatic pistol (as opposed to revolver) cartridges which have been adopted for this sport.

<text>The .480 Ruger (12.1×33mmR) is a large, high-power revolver cartridge, introduced in 2003 by Ruger and Hornady. It was the first new cartridge introduced by Ruger, and when introduced, was the second largest-diameter production revolver cartridge, at .

==Design==
The .475 Linebaugh was introduced around 1988, for a custom, five-shot Ruger Blackhawk single-action revolver. The .475 is a wildcat cartridge made by cutting a .45-70 case to a length of , and necking it to accept a .475 bullet. The .475 Linebaugh is an immensely powerful cartridge, almost as powerful as the .454 Casull, the most powerful production revolver cartridge at the time (the .475 generates about 1,800 ft-lbs of energy. The .454 can generate around 2,000 ft-lbs). The .475-diameter bullet allows bullet weights over , a feat not possible with the .45 caliber cartridge cases, and the terminal ballistics of the heavy bullet, even when loaded to moderate velocities, were impressive. The .475 Linebaugh was designed for handgun hunting of large game, such as bear, where deep penetration is required for a quick, humane kill, and the heavy, cast Keith-style semiwadcutter bullets out of the .475 Linebaugh penetrated very well.

==History==

When Ruger began to design their new cartridge, they started with the .475 Linebaugh &quot;super-magnum&quot; cartridge but went a different direction. Rather than using the Blackhawk, Ruger chose to chamber the new round in the double-action Super Redhawk, and designed the cartridge to fit in a 6-shot cylinder. The Super Redhawk was already the only 6-shot .454 Casull revolver in production, as all other makers used 5-shot cylinders to keep the cylinder walls thicker to handle the high pressures. The .480 Ruger uses lower pressures than the .454 Casull, at 48,000 psi, so the .454 Casull can produce higher velocities and more energy. Although, with much lighter bullets than available in .475 caliber. The .480 case was also .115 inches shorter than the .475 Linebaugh, at 1.285 inches, the same as the .44 Magnum. The .480&#x27;s large diameter rim is also turned down, which is required to fit the 6 cartridges in the Super Redhawk&#x27;s cylinder without interference.

The .480 Ruger is viewed by some as a &quot;.475 Special&quot;, a slightly downgraded version of the super-magnum cartridge. In fact, .480 Ruger rounds will fit and function in a .475 Linebaugh revolver, just as a .44 Special will fit and function in revolvers chambered for the .44 Magnum. Reviewing the .480&#x27;s ballistics, however, reveals this is somewhat misleading, as this &quot;Special&quot; reference may cause one to consider the .480 a low-powered target round when in actuality it is much closer to its more powerful cousin the .475 Linebaugh than the .44 Special is to the .44 Magnum. The .480 Ruger operates at a maximum pressure of 48,000 psi, whereas the Linebaugh has a maximum pressure of 50,000, showing how close indeed the two cartridges are. Depending on load, the .480 Ruger can easily reach within of the .475 Linebaugh, making it a very formidable hunting cartridge for large and dangerous game.

The initial response to the .480 Ruger was mixed, as many reviewers compared it unfavorably to the more powerful .475 Linebaugh or .454 Casull, and wondered why Ruger had bothered to introduce a lower-powered cartridge. (This was based on muzzle energy alone, with no regard to either bullet diameter or weight, or to TKO, as was evident in the sales literature and magazines of the times, which compared the new 325 gr load&#x27;s muzzle energy to the muzzle energy of other handgun hunting cartridges.) Indeed, the first factory load, a bullet at , is nearly within reach of the .44 Magnum. However, with bullets of and higher, the .480 Ruger starts to show more potential. The standard .44 Magnum powders, in similar amounts, will push a bullet at over 1300 ft/s (thus yielding a TKO factor around 35.28 vs. 34.62 for a 325 gr 454 Casull at ). This provides of muzzle energy, about 50% more than commercial .44 Magnum loads, showing the .480 Ruger&#x27;s good efficiency with the heavy bullets. The lower velocities and lower pressures mean the .480 Ruger has less felt recoil and muzzle blast than the higher-pressure super-magnums.

==Usage==

The .480 is a well-balanced cartridge, providing a lot of energy without the recoil of larger hard-kicking rounds. It has been stated by many gun writers that the .44 Magnum is typically the most powerful handgun an average person can master. The .480&#x27;s original Hornady loading of a 325 gr JHP, easily surpasses factory loadings for the .44 Magnum, with very similar recoil in handguns of like weight. As a point of reference, the factory 325 gr bullet of the .480 Ruger has the same approximate sectional density as a 265 gr projectile in the .44 Magnum, which has been proven adequate for very large game species with hard cast or all copper or copper alloy bullets of similar weight. Phil Shoemaker, a very experienced Alaskan brown bear hunting guide with decades of experience, has used 260 gr hard cast bullets in his .44 magnum revolver for bear protection in Alaska. Essentially, the .480 Ruger is like a 22 percent bigger .44 magnum since it shoots bullets of similar sectional densities to the same approximate velocities as the .44 magnum with comparable barrel lengths, and the increase in sectional area of .475 caliber bullets over .44 caliber bullets is 22 percent.

The future of this round remains unsure. Magazine articles and online forums were, for a brief while, replete with discussions about the potential of the cartridge. However, lackluster sales and a limited number of firearms available in this caliber have shown it to have only moderate popularity. Handloaders reported getting phenomenal performance out of the round, rubbing shoulders with the .475 Linebaugh and easily equaling and even eclipsing the Taylor Knockout Value (TKO) of the .454 Casull, with less recoil, muzzle blast and noise due to the .480&#x27;s lower pressures. Still, for the most part, the round was seen as not doing anything new, and available loads limited its potential for the non-handloader to mere deer hunting (for which many calibers already exist to serve that need).

After Smith &amp; Wesson introduced its .500 S&amp;W in 2003, and .460 S&amp;W Magnum in 2005, the .480 fell even further into obscurity as it could not compete with the glitz of these new mega-cartridges. Revolvers chambered in .460 S&amp;W Magnum can usually accept .454 Casull, .45 Colt, and .45 Schofield rounds as well (in the same way that a .475 Linebaugh revolver can take .480 Ruger), a useful cost-saving feature that can increase the appeal of the .460 over the .480 for some shooters, especially for practice sessions where full-power rounds are not necessary.

There were many handgunners that disliked the heavy Super Redhawk and waited for Ruger to release the cartridge in their Super Blackhawk single-action. This did not occur until August 2015, when a Bisley Super Blackhawk model in .454 Casull and .480 Ruger, was announced as a distributor exclusive through Lipsey&#x27;s.

<text>Bad Mojo is an adventure video game by Pulse Entertainment, released in 1996. The player is cast as Roger Samms, an entomologist planning to embezzle money from a research grant to escape his sordid life above an abandoned bar. An accident with his mother&#x27;s enchanted locket unleashes a curse — the titular &quot;bad mojo&quot; — that turns him into a cockroach. The storyline in &quot;Bad Mojo&quot; is loosely based on Franz Kafka&#x27;s 1915 novella &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;; Roger Samms&#x27; name is an imperfect anagram of the lead character&#x27;s in &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (Gregor Samsa), and a cat called Franz appears in the game. The gameplay consists of guiding the cockroach through a series of puzzles.

Got Game Entertainment re-released the game in December 2004 as &quot;Bad Mojo Redux&quot;, packaging it with a DVD containing a variety of extra material.

==Plot==
The story takes place in 1995 in a rundown bar owned by Eddie Battito. Roger, one of Eddie&#x27;s tenants, has stolen a million dollars worth of loan money from a science corporation he had previously worked for and is planning to leave for Mexico City to start a new life. But after a small argument with Eddie, he remembers a little trinket that he had gotten in his early childhood: a cockroach-patterned locket that belonged to his deceased mother, Angelina. Upon its discovery, the locket transforms Roger&#x27;s soul into a cockroach, and transports him to a mysterious sewer system connected to every section of the bar. His adventure takes him to the basement (which is also Eddie&#x27;s bedroom), the bathroom, the kitchen, the bar room, Roger&#x27;s room and finally his research room. As the roach (Roger) explores a world filled with danger at every turn, including rats, garbage disposals, and his own pet cat, Franz, he is constantly being guided by his mother&#x27;s spirit, who serves as an oracle.

The game explores the sad past of both Roger and Eddie, revealing that Roger had been abandoned to an abusive nun, was the center of bullying as a young man, and was never taken seriously by his superiors. Eddie has had just as bad a life, having his beloved wife die during childbirth and giving up his son out of grief and his livelihood stumbling. Eddie does not realize that his wife, Angelina, was Roger&#x27;s mother, nor does Roger know that Angelina was Eddie&#x27;s wife. During Roger&#x27;s exploration, he is forced to extinguish the pilot light to a gas stove in the kitchen to save a baby cockroach that, in turn, assists him in jamming the garbage disposal with a spoon. This act eventually causes the whole bar to be filled with gas. Roger must then set off a smoke detector to wake Eddie and then finally reach the locket in his own unconscious body&#x27;s hand. With both men safely out of the bar when it explodes, Roger and Eddie discover that they are, in fact, father and son, which was exactly as the oracle planned.

There are four possible endings to the storyline. If Eddie makes it out and Roger doesn&#x27;t (if Eddie is warned of the fire but Roger is left on the floor), Eddie ends up as a homeless drunk. If Roger makes it out and Eddie doesn&#x27;t, Roger tries to flee the country but is caught, charged with Eddie&#x27;s murder, and remanded to an asylum for the criminally insane. If neither make it out, the ghost of Angelina narrates, telling of the death of both men, the destruction of the bar for urban renewal and that the ghosts of all three souls haunt the area where their dreams died. If both of them make it out, Eddie recognizes the cockroach locket (that contains a photo of Angelina) and they reconcile as re-united father and son before both reveal the truth about their past. The family is reunited and they travel together to Mexico with the embezzled money, which Eddie uses to buy a new bar while Roger sets up a small lab to study roaches.

==Gameplay==
The game begins in an underground hub with pipes to all the different rooms, which are sealed except one. By navigating from one room to another, the player unlocks the pipe to that room for easier backtracking. Roger is controlled solely using the directional arrow keys. As a cockroach, he can move small objects like cigarettes and bottle tops or weigh down precariously placed items.

In each room, there are hazards to avoid, lethal barriers to get around and puzzles to solve. The presence of hazards and ways to navigate to certain areas can be determined by observing other cockroaches. The player has four lives. A life is lost when Roger makes contact with anything deadly. When all lives are depleted, the player is sent back to the underground hub and must start the last room reached from the beginning (although the state of objects stays as the player last changed them).

A symbol of a flaming eye can often be found near living creatures, such as other cockroaches. Touching the eye causes the creature to provide hints to progress through visions and verse (voiced by Angelina). Background objects tell more about the characters and their history.

==Development==
&quot;Bad Mojo&quot;″s development was troubled: director Vinny Carrella noted that there was &quot;a pall over the production&quot; and &quot;no happiness, just pain&quot;. The original designer Drew Huffman came up with concept of having a small character in the gameplay due to the technical slowdowns on computers at the time. To begin with, the game was codenamed the &quot;Booger Project&quot;. Huffman and Vincent Carella were brainstorming the game with Phill Simon taking inspirations from their experience with cockroach infestations, Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; and the 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. The puzzles that were implemented focused on realism and the capabilities of a cockroach.

For graphics, the team used a mixture of CG and live action. It took a lot of study and modelling to get realistic looking roach graphics in the game animating the walk cycles frame by frame. About 720 screens in the game were produced. Parts of the cutscenes were created using Swivel 3D.

Some elements in the game required some specialists. A professional cat wrangler and trainer was hired to move the cat on the set and insurance was also required for the cat. The German cockroaches were provided by the Carolina Biological Supply Company. Controlling the roaches required a freezer to slow down their activity. The rat was caught and killed by an exterminator. The live catfish were bought from a fishmonger in Chinatown, San Francisco. During the production, a few animals were harmed, including a tarantula.

The game features a substantial electronic music soundtrack composed and performed by the American electro-industrial artist Xorcist, which has also written soundtracks for other CD-ROM games, notably &quot;Iron Helix&quot;.

==Release==
By early 1996, a demo was released featuring a trailer, text plot and a short gameplay with only five screens of the basement.

The game was planned for the Sega Saturn. Shortly after the PC release, Acclaim Entertainment announced they would publish a port of the game for the Saturn. However, it went unreleased, and has not been confirmed that development ever began.

Got Game Entertainment re-released the game in December 2004 as &quot;Bad Mojo Redux&quot;. All in-game videos were remastered from original footage. &quot;Redux&quot; runs in truecolor only, opposed to the 1996 release which required only 256-color mode. This change makes the videos clearer and more colorful. The re-release also came with a bonus DVD, which contained a making-of, art galleries and other bonuses. This DVD was omitted from the UK release.

The game was distributed by Nightdive Studios, who released the game in the digital storefront Steam on July 3, 2014, while GOG.com added it to their store on May 22, 2014.

On 2019, Xorcist released a vinyl soundtrack of the game&#x27;s score.

==Reception==
According to co-producer Alex Louie, the original 1996 release of &quot;Bad Mojo&quot; was commercially successful. Following the game&#x27;s launch, &quot;Macworld&quot; reported that it was &quot;selling steadily.&quot; By February 1997, roughly 12 months after its release, its sales had reached 175,000 units. Louie said in 2004 that he was &quot;pretty sure we sold over 200,000 units&quot; by the end of &quot;Bad Mojo&quot;″s shelf life. It also received accolades from critics. Inside Mac Games nominated &quot;Bad Mojo&quot; as its pick for 1996&#x27;s best adventure game, but ultimately presented the award to &quot;&quot;. Conversely, the editors of &quot;Macworld&quot; gave &quot;Bad Mojo&quot; their 1996 &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; award. Steven Levy of the magazine called it &quot;an amazing experience&quot;. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;Bad Mojo&quot; the 30th-best adventure game ever released.

Arinn Dembo, writing for Computer Gaming World, gave the game 4 stars. &quot;MacAddict&quot; magazine gave the game its highest rating of &quot;Freakin&#x27; Awesome&quot;, with reviewer Kathy Tafel praising the game&#x27;s world as &quot;rich&quot; and saying that it was &quot;both amusing and disgusting.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Maximum&quot; opined that the game&#x27;s unique and eerie story and presentation make it a compelling experience in spite of the limited gameplay. However, he felt that the lack of longevity was a major downside. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;Bad Mojo&quot; isn&#x27;t the best graphic adventure, but it&#x27;s got something that counts a long ways - peculiarity. ... no other adventure has been as willing to show the savage gruesomeness of mankind&#x27;s sloth.&quot;

The editors of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; presented &quot;Bad Mojo Redux&quot; with their &quot;Best Adventure Game 2004&quot; award. Chuck Osborn of the magazine wrote that it &quot;remains as inventive and resourceful as ever — and [is] ultimately better than any other adventure released this year.&quot;

<text>Monte Azul is a municipality in the north of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The population is 20,696 (2020 est.) in an area of 994 km². The elevation is 582 meters. It became a municipality in 1878. The postal code (CEP) is 39500-000.

The municipality contains part of the Caminho dos Gerais State Park, created in 2007.
Monte Azul is part of the statistical microregion of Janaúba. It is 627 km. from the state capital, Belo Horizonte and about 30 km. south of the state boundary with Bahia. It is connected by paved roads to the regional center of Janaúba to the south. It is on the Minas Gerais-Bahia railroad line, which last had passenger service in 1996. 

The main economic activities are cattle raising (30,000 head in 2006) and farming with modest production of rice, beans, corn, and sorghum. In 2006, there were 2,531 rural producers with a total area of 66,342 hectares. Cropland made up 8,500 hectares and natural pasture 67,000 hectares. There were only 67 tractors, a ratio of one for every 70 farms. In the urban area, there were 2 financial institutions as of 2006. There were 1,212 automobiles, giving a ratio of about one automobile for every 19 inhabitants. The Gross Domestic Product was R$ 63,578,000 (2005), which was mainly generated by services. Health care was provided by 17 public health clinics. There was one private hospital with 17 beds (2005). 

Settlement of this region goes back to colonial times. The first name was Tremedal and it belonged to the capitania of Bahia. The first chapel was built in 1818. In 1840, the district of Tremedal was transferred from Formiga (present day Montes Claros) to Grão Mogol. In 1850, it was a district of Rio Pardo de Minas. In 1878, it separated from Rio Pardo and became the municipality of Boa Vista do Tremedal. In 1887, it became a city. In 1938, the name was changed to Monte Azul because of the color of the nearby mountains.

<doc id="1061639" wikidata="Q2140759" url="?curid=1061639" title="Salt Lake Tabernacle">
<text>The Salt Lake Tabernacle, formerly known as the Mormon Tabernacle, is located on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, in the U.S. state of Utah. The Tabernacle was built from 1863 to 1875 to house meetings for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It was the location of the church&#x27;s semi-annual general conference until the meeting was moved to the new and larger LDS Conference Center in 2000. Now a historic building on Temple Square, the Salt Lake Tabernacle is still used for overflow crowds during general conference. It is renowned for its remarkable acoustics and iconic pipe organ. The Tabernacle Choir has performed there for over 100 years.

==Background==
The Salt Lake Tabernacle was inspired by an attempt to build a Canvas Tabernacle in Nauvoo, Illinois, in the 1840s. That tabernacle was to be situated just to the west of the Nauvoo Temple and was to be oval-shaped, much the same as the Salt Lake Tabernacle. However, the Nauvoo edifice (never built) was to have amphitheater-style or terraced seating, and was to have canvas roofing.

==Construction==
The Tabernacle was built between 1864 and 1867 on the west center-line axis of the Salt Lake Temple. In 1892 it was the largest assembly hall in the United States. The roof was constructed in the lattice-truss arch system, which was devised by Ithiel Town and is held together by dowels and wedges. The building has a sandstone foundation, and the dome is supported by forty-four sandstone piers. Prior to its refurbishing in 2007, the overall seating capacity of the building was around 7,000, which included the choir area and gallery (balcony).

Henry Grow, a civil engineer, oversaw the initial construction of the Tabernacle, where the domed roof was the most innovative portion of the building. Brigham Young, church president at the time, wanted the Tabernacle roof constructed in an elongated dome shape with no interior pillars or posts to obstruct the view for the audience (the gallery was added later). When Young asked Grow how large a roof he could construct using the style of lattice that he had used on the Remington bridge, Grow replied that it could be &quot;100 feet wide and as long as is wanted.&quot; Eventually, Grow engineered the Tabernacle roof exterior to be 150 feet across, 250 feet long, and 80 feet high. Skeptics insisted that when the interior scaffolding was removed, the whole roof would collapse. The roof structure was nine feet thick, formed by a &quot;Remington lattice truss&quot; of timbers pinned together with wooden pegs. Green rawhide was wrapped around the timbers so that when the rawhide dried it tightened its grip on the pegs. When the roof&#x27;s structural work was completed, sheeting was applied on the roof, which was then covered with shingles. The interior was lathed and then plastered; the hair of cattle was mixed with the plaster to give it strength.

Construction of the Tabernacle began on July 26, 1864, but construction of the roof did not begin until 1865, when all 44 supporting sandstone piers designed by William H. Folsom were in place. Grow rapidly built the roof structure from the center out, but encountered difficulty engineering the semicircular ends of the roof. This difficulty dragged structural work on the roof into the fall of 1866 even as other parts of the roof were being shingled. However, Grow finished and shingled the entire roof by the spring of 1867, before the interior of the building was finished. The Tabernacle was first used for the October 1867 conference. The roof has lasted for over a century without any structural problems, though the shingles were replaced with aluminum in 1947.

The original benches and columns supporting the balcony were made from the native &quot;white pine&quot; (Engelmann Spruce) that the Mormon pioneers found in the area. Because they wanted to &quot;give their best to the Lord&quot;, they hand-painted grain on the benches to look like oak and the pillars to resemble marble. During the renovations completed in 2007, the original benches were replaced with new oak pews, and legroom was increased from nine to 14 inches, causing an overall loss of capacity of 1000 seats.

The Salt Lake Tabernacle organ has its case positioned at the west end above the choir seats, and is the focal point of the Tabernacle&#x27;s interior. The original organ was made by Joseph H. Ridges in 1867 and contained 700 pipes. The organ has been rebuilt several times with the total pipe count being 11,623, making the Tabernacle organ one of the largest pipe organs in the world. The current organ is the work of G. Donald Harrison of the Aeolian-Skinner organ company, and was completed in 1948. The organ was renovated and restored in 1989 with a few minor changes and additions. The largest 32-foot display pipes in the façade are made of wood and were constructed in the same manner as the balcony columns.

==Architecture==
The structure was an architectural wonder in its day, prompting a writer for &quot;Scientific American&quot; to comment on &quot;the mechanical difficulties of attending the construction of so ponderous a roof.&quot; In 1882, while on a lecture tour of America, Oscar Wilde noted that the building had the appearance of a soup kettle; he added that it was the most purely dreadful building he ever saw. Some visitors around the beginning of the 20th century criticized it as &quot;a prodigious tortoise that has lost its way&quot; or &quot;the Church of the Holy Turtle,&quot; but Frank Lloyd Wright dubbed the tabernacle &quot;one of the architectural masterpieces of the country and perhaps the world.&quot;

=== Art and statuary ===
For several years the Tabernacle had various pieces of art on its walls. There was a mural depicting Joseph Smith receiving the Gold plates from an angel. There was also a portrait of Joseph Smith that hung between the organ&#x27;s largest pipes. In 1875 there was a fountain placed in the middle of the building, &quot;it represented the &#x27;living water&#x27; offered by Christ and His gospel.&quot; In the same year, a statue of an angel sounding a trumpet was placed between the Organ&#x27;s two largest pipes. The highest pulpit was lined with Lion statues to represent Brigham Young as the &quot;Lion of the Lord.&quot;

===Decorations ===
After its initial construction the structure had little paint so decorations were often used. Some examples include a blue banner with a gold beehive on the rear wall (1875), a star with the word Utah, a banner that read &quot;Under the everlasting covenant God must and shall be glorified,&quot; American flags (one of the largest measured 75 ft by 160 ft), bunting, garland, festoons, and flowers. Some people complained because the decorations were left up for extended periods of time.

==Purpose==
The Tabernacle was the location of the church&#x27;s semi-annual general conference for 132 years. Because of the growth in the number of attendees, general conference was moved to the new and larger Conference Center in 2000. In the October 1999 General Conference, church president Gordon B. Hinckley gave a talk honoring the Tabernacle and introducing the new Conference Center. The building is still used for overflow crowds during general conference.

The Tabernacle is the home of The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, and was the previous home of the Utah Symphony Orchestra until the construction of Abravanel Hall. It is the historic broadcasting home for the radio and television program known as &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot;.

== Acoustics ==
Built at a time before electronics and audio amplifiers, the Tabernacle was constructed with remarkable acoustic qualities so the entire congregation could hear sermons given there. The roof was constructed in a three-dimensional ellipse with the pulpit at one focus of the ellipse. The elliptical concept came from church president Brigham Young, who reportedly said that the design was inspired by &quot;the best sounding board in the world ... the roof of my mouth.&quot; The elliptical design causes a large portion of the sound from the pulpit end of the building to be concentrated and projected to the focus at the opposite end of the building.

Several years after the initial construction was completed, Truman O. Angell was brought in to further improve the building&#x27;s acoustics, and was responsible for adding the gallery (balcony) in 1870 that resolved the outstanding acoustical issues. The building has an international reputation as one of the most acoustically perfect buildings in the world. A pin drop can be heard from one side of the building to another over 250 feet away.

== Refurbishing ==

The Tabernacle was closed from January 2005 to March 2007 for seismic retrofitting and extensive renovations. The baptistry, which was located in the lower portion at the rear of the Tabernacle, was removed as part of the renovation. New gold leafing was applied to the visible organ pipes, the ceiling was repaired and repainted, new dressing rooms and a music library for choir members were created, three recording studios were built underneath the main floor, the rostrum was remodeled to accommodate a secondary seating arrangement or a stage for performances, and all plumbing was replaced. The building was reopened in March 2007, and rededicated for use on March 31, 2007. An opening gala concert with the Tabernacle Choir was held on April 6–7, 2007.

As part of the renovation, all 44 piers that support the Tabernacle&#x27;s roof were reinforced with steel bars, which were inserted into the piers from the bottom. The foundation of each pier was also reinforced with concrete. Steel boxes were used to connect trusses, and were also attached to the piers, clinched tight with structural steel.

==Notable speakers and guests==
Twelve presidents of the United States have spoken from the Tabernacle pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt (1903), William Howard Taft (1909 and 1911), Woodrow Wilson (1919), Warren G. Harding (1923), Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932, then Governor of New York), Herbert Hoover (1932), Harry S. Truman (1948), Dwight D. Eisenhower (1952), John F. Kennedy (1963), Lyndon B. Johnson (1964), Richard Nixon (1970), and Jimmy Carter (1978).

Other notable people who have spoken in the Tabernacle include Susan B. Anthony (1895), Charles Lindbergh (1927), and Helen Keller (1941). Along with praising the decision to allow women equal voting rights in Utah Territory, Anthony praised the Tabernacle itself: &quot;It is just about twenty-four years ago that I was present in this great Tabernacle on the day upon which you dedicated it to the service of the Lord, and every nook and corner, of this great building was packed on the occasion with people from every part of the Territory, many being unable to gain admittance. It was the most magnificent gathering I ever saw.&quot;

In 1980, James Stewart guest-conducted the Tabernacle Choir in the building as part of the filming of &quot;Mr. Krueger&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, a television special broadcast on NBC.

== Tourism ==
Initially tourists were discouraged from visiting the Tabernacle because it was considered as holy as the Temple or Endowment House. There were even some debates among church leadership in the late 19th century about disciplining members of the church who led tours, but tours were led through 1900. 

Currently tours are offered to anyone who would like one. It is common for LDS Church missionaries tour guides to demonstrate the acoustic properties of the Tabernacle by dropping a pin on the pulpit or tearing a newspaper there, which can be heard throughout the building.

<text>Aragalur (&quot;six moat place&quot;) is a village in Salem district, Tamil Nadu, India. It is about 6 km from Thalaivasal and 70 km from Salem.

==Etymology==
Aragalur literally means &quot;six moat place&quot; or the village having six moats. The moats were historically located near Kuyavar Street, Pullaakulam (North), Soleswaran Temple, Kottikulam (North), Kavarai Street &amp; Uppulimedu. One of the records suggest that the moats could have been in concentric circles. Most of the moats have been filled and flattened to keep up the population growth.

==History==
Aragalur (Arakalur / Aragaloor / Aragazhur) was the capital of Magadai mandalam ruled by the well known Bana chieftains around 1190-1260 CE. Aragalurudaiya Ponparappinan Rajarajadevan alias Magadesan was the greatest in this dynasty. Pallava inscriptions say, Chief Vanakovaraiyan Rajarajadevan Vannenjan alias Vannenja, a subordinate of Kopperunjingadeva - Kadava dynasty, lived in Aragalur around 1254 CE. The chief at Aragalur also has a family title of &#x27;Ponparappinan&#x27;- referring to the gilding of the central shrine of the Arunachaleswara Temple at Tiruvannamalai and &#x27;Bana&#x27; the clan / family title. Aragalur Udaya Iraratevan Ponparappinan had refurbished most of the parts and rebuilt some parts of Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram in 1213 AD . This dynasty ruled at the same period as Kulothunga Chola III, and Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I. Pandian won over Magadesan in 1251 CE but returned the kingdom back. Magadesan ruled Aragalur without being subordinate and hence was captured and kept at Sankagiri fort. Magadesan&#x27;s insignia was Rishabha the sacred Bull and the Garuda the sacred eagle and his elephant was called Airavata.

<text>The .218 Bee / 5.7x34mmR is a .22 caliber centerfire rifle cartridge designed for varmint hunting by Winchester in 1937. The cartridge was originally chambered in the Winchester Model 65 lever-action rifles, which may have ultimately led to its lack of popularity. The cartridge is named for the bore diameter of the barrel in which the cartridge is chambered rather than the usual practice in the United States of having the cartridge&#x27;s nomenclature reflect in some way the bullet diameter.

==History==
The .218 Bee cartridge was designed by Winchester for use in their Model 65 lever-action rifles. Winchester designed the cartridge by necking down the .25-20 Winchester cartridge to accept a .224 diameter bullet. Just as the .32-20 can be considered to be the parent cartridge of the .25-20, it can also be considered the parent cartridge to the .218 Bee. The cartridge was introduced as a commercial cartridge by Winchester in 1937 in their Model 65 lever action rifle, which was also chambered for the .25-20 and .32-20 Winchester cartridges. However, while the .25-20 and the .32-20 Model 65 rifles have 22-inch (560 mm) barrels, the rifles chambered for the Bee have 24-inch (610 mm) barrels.

Despite showing some early promise, the cartridge never really caught on, even though it was later chambered by Winchester in their new bolt-action Model 43 rifle and by Sako in their L-46 rifle. There was some question about the accuracy of the .218 Bee as compared to the .222, but that was likely due to the difference of inherent accuracy between the bolt-actions rifles commonly chambered for the .222 and the lever-actions commonly chambered for the .218 Bee. Although not in common use, it is still a very effective cartridge in its class, for small to medium varmints out to about . Production ammunition and rifles are still available from a few manufacturers.

==Performance==
In terms of relative performance, the .218 Bee falls between the smaller .22 Hornet, and the larger .222 Remington and the more popular .223 Remington.

<text>The .22 Hornet or 5.6×36mmR Hornet is a varminting, small-game hunting, survival and competition centerfire rifle cartridge commercially introduced in 1930. It is considerably more powerful than the rimfire .22 WMR and the .17 HMR, achieving higher velocity with a bullet twice the weight of the .17 HMR bullet. The Hornet also differs significantly from these in that being a centerfire cartridge makes it reloadable, and thus more versatile. It was the smallest commercially available .22 caliber centerfire cartridge until the introduction of the FN 5.7×28mm.

The .22 Hornet should not be confused with the 5.6x35mmR Vierling. As per C.I.P., the Hornet case has a longer shoulder length, case length and thicker rim than the Vierling. This makes it very difficult to chamber the higher pressure Hornet cartridge in a Vierling rifle.

The .22 Hornet fills the gap between such popular varmint/predator cartridges as the .22 WMR and the .223 Remington. In regard to muzzle velocity, muzzle energy and noise, it is well suited to vermin and predator control in relatively built-up areas.

==History==
Prior to the development of the modern .22 Hornet, there was a conceptually similar but physically different cartridge by the same name invented in the 1890s by Reuben Harwood (nicknamed &quot;Iron Ramrod)&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;.22 Harwood Hornet&quot; to avoid confusion, as the two rounds are not compatible. Harwood&#x27;s cartridge was formed by necking down .25-20 brass to .22 caliber, and was initially loaded with black powder.

The modern .22 Hornet&#x27;s ancestry is generally attributed to experiments done in the 1920s using the black-powder .22 WCF at Springfield Armory. Winchester adopted what had so far been a wildcat cartridge in 1930, producing ammo for a cartridge for which no commercially made guns yet had been built. It was not until 1932 that any company began selling commercially made guns for the cartridge.

Wildcat variants of the .22 Hornet, such as the .22 K-Hornet (designed by Lysle Kilbourn) and .22 Ackley Improved Hornet, can boost bullet velocity and energy considerably above factory .22 Hornet levels, but performance still falls short of what is deer-legal in the Netherlands or the United Kingdom, although it is legal for deer in some other countries and some American states.

==Performance==
Factory ammunition is widely available from all major manufacturers, with bullets generally weighing 34, 35, 45, or 46 grains (2.2, 2.3, 2.9, or 3.0 g), with bullets invariably either hollow point or soft point. Muzzle velocity typically is in the range, and muzzle energy is just over 700 ft·lbf (950 J) for factory ammo fired from a rifle. Velocities and energies are less when Hornet ammunition is fired from short-barreled firearms.

Published handload data from major handloading-product companies shows how versatile the .22 Hornet can be. According to the Hodgdon Powder Company reloading data, the heavier bullets show an affinity for Lil&#x27;Gun smokeless powder to produce much higher velocities than other powder with heavy bullets in this small case.

==Applications==
===Survival===
Beginning during World War II, aircrew survival rifles in .22 Hornet were developed and issued by the U.S. military. They were a bolt-action rifle with collapsible stock (M4 Survival Rifle), a break-open rifle/shotgun over-under (M6 Aircrew Survival Weapon), and a takedown bolt-action rifle (AR-5/MA-1). Military survival issue .22 Hornet ammunition was loaded with soft-point expanding jacketed bullets, not complying with the Hague Convention. The United States was the only exception to a complete prohibition of the use of expanding bullets in war, due to its ambiguous policy. However, the cartridge boxes were labeled &quot;Under no circumstances is the ammunition to be used for offensive or defensive measures against enemy personnel. This ammunition is provided for use with your emergency survival rifle for the killing of game for food under emergency survival conditions only.&quot;

===Competition===
The .22 Hornet is a popular cartridge for the Field/Hunter&#x27;s pistol category in IHMSA and NRA metallic silhouette shooting.

===Hunting===
Survivalist Mel Tappan on the .22 Hornet: &quot;It is accurate, has virtually no recoil and a light report... [I]ts performance limits its use to small game and pests within 150 or 175 yards. It is by no means a reliable deer cartridge, even with handloads.&quot;

Sam Fadala of &quot;GUNS&quot; magazine calls it &quot;perfect for mid-range varmints of all stripes,&quot; everything from small game, mountain birds (e.g., blue grouse), turkey, javelina, peccaries, coyote, and Australian wild pigs and goats.

The Hornet is considered an optimal cartridge for turkey hunting, though it is not as powerful as modern .22 centerfires. At mid-century, southern sportsman Henry Edwards Davis pronounced the Winchester Model 70 chambered for the Hornet &quot;the best commercial rifle for wild turkeys the world has ever seen&quot;. In 2011, Lane Kinney was awarded the &quot;Top Turkey in the World&quot; award by Safari Club International for a record-setting Osceola turkey taken with a T/C Contender pistol in .22 Hornet.

The Hornet&#x27;s virtual absence of recoil has made it even quite popular among deer hunters in some areas, although it is generally regarded as very underpowered for deer unless bullet placement is absolutely precise. American hunter Jack O&#x27;Connor decried this practice in the 1950s, stating the Hornet could &quot;under no circumstances&quot; be considered a deer cartridge. Many jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, the UK (other than England and Wales) and some states in the USA currently prohibit the Hornet (and other .22 caliber cartridges) for use on deer.

The .22 Hornet also proved popular among the Alaskan Inuit due to low cost, who used it for hunting seals, caribou, and even polar bears.

==Firearms==
Rifles are currently (2007) being chambered in .22 Hornet by Ruger, New England Firearms, CZ and various other mass-market manufacturers. Most current-production rifles in .22 Hornet are either bolt-action or single-shot designs, with the exception of a very few &quot;survival&quot; rifle/shotgun over-under designs such as the Savage Model 24 from Savage and a few European-made &quot;kipplauf&quot; break-action single-shot rifles, and &quot;drilling&quot; break-action shotgun/rifle combinations consisting of two side-by-side shotgun barrels and a rifle barrel underneath. Older guns generally have a slower twist rate of 1-16&quot; (or one turn in every of barrel length) for lighter bullets with a .223 caliber dimension. Newer guns feature a faster 1-14&quot; twist in the .224 bore diameter.

Revolvers have been produced in .22 Hornet by Taurus, Magnum Research, and others with Ruger releasing a large frame version in 2024. Single-shot pistols in .22 Hornet have been made by Thompson Center Arms. Muzzle velocities are somewhat less for this cartridge in short-barreled handguns than in rifles.

<text>KOVR (channel 13) is a television station licensed to Stockton, California, United States, serving as the CBS outlet for the Sacramento area. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s CBS News and Stations division alongside KMAX-TV (channel 31), an independent station. The two stations share studios on KOVR Drive in West Sacramento; KOVR&#x27;s transmitter is located in Walnut Grove, California.

After an application process stretching back to 1948, KOVR began broadcasting in September 1954 from studios in Stockton and a transmitter atop Mount Diablo. This facility provided wide coverage from San Francisco to Sacramento and beyond, but KOVR could not obtain a network affiliation in the San Francisco market, and it had to pay higher programming costs as a San Francisco station. To remedy these issues, the station moved transmitter sites in 1957, becoming fully a Stockton- and Sacramento-area station, and obtained an affiliation with ABC. It partly merged with Sacramento&#x27;s original ABC affiliate, KCCC-TV, a struggling UHF station.

After moving, the station was sold twice before being acquired by newspaper publisher McClatchy in 1963. This made KOVR a sister to the KFBK radio stations in Sacramento as well as &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; newspaper; it marked McClatchy&#x27;s entry into local television after an unsuccessful attempt to win channel 10 in the 1950s. McClatchy sold the station in 1980 under intense government pressure on owners of newspaper-broadcast combinations, and it changed hands another six times from 1983 to 1996. The station became a CBS affiliate in 1995 as the result of an affiliation switch and was purchased by CBS in 2005; uniquely, it broadcasts prime time programming one hour ahead of other West Coast stations. Traditionally a third-rated station in local news, ratings have gradually improved for its newscasts since the 1990s.

==History==

===The Mount Diablo years===

On March 5, 1948, Radio Diablo, Inc. (later Television Diablo) filed an application for a new television station to broadcast on channel 13, first assigned to San Francisco and then to San Jose, from Mount Diablo in Contra Costa County. From Mount Diablo, the principals in Radio Diablo operated FM station KSBR, which had an effective radiated power of 250,000 watts and, having just moved to the mountaintop, claimed it was heard from the Oregon state line to Bakersfield. Two other groups applied for the channel by late 1948, but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) imposed a freeze on new television station grants that October.

When the freeze ended in 1952, channel 13 had been removed from San Jose to Stockton, where it could still cover the city of license from Mount Diablo. Stockton radio station KXOB filed a competing application for channel 13. Radio Diablo, headed by O. H. Brown, estimated it could serve 3.5 million people in San Francisco, Stockton, and Sacramento from its mountaintop site. The owners of KXOB ultimately received shares in Radio Diablo in exchange for the dismissal of KXOB&#x27;s competing application in a settlement agreement. Broadcaster and furniture store owner Edward Peffer entered into a similar agreement, paving the way for the FCC to grant Radio Diablo the construction permit on February 11, 1954. Leslie Hoffman, who had become the new president of the company, was to have the station named for him as KHOF, but when Hoffman thought of the possibility of &quot;cough&quot; puns based on the designation, the call sign was changed to KOVR, for &quot;coverage&quot;.

KOVR began broadcasting September 6, 1954; after an opening night telecast produced in the Stockton studios, it aired live coverage from the California State Fair. It had studios in Stockton on Miner Avenue, as well as a converted bus that served as a remote broadcast van along with two other mobile units. KOVR was the second television station in Stockton; an ultra high frequency (UHF) outlet, KTVU (channel 36), had gone on the air the previous December.

As an independent station without network affiliation, the program schedule was heavy with local programming. Lynn Taylor hosted a talent show, a weeknight &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; show, and a teen program. Sportscaster Bob Fouts began commuting to Stockton from San Francisco to host a sports show, leaving KGO-TV in that city, and regional news coverage and a bingo program were also slated. Art Finley hosted an afternoon children&#x27;s program, &quot;Toonytown&quot;, on the station for several years before moving to San Francisco&#x27;s KRON-TV.

By 1955, the station had opened offices in San Francisco, where at one point it was proposed that NBC might try to affiliate with or purchase KOVR given discord with KRON-TV, its San Francisco affiliate, and a desire by NBC to own its San Francisco outlet. An attempt to move its main operation from Stockton to San Francisco was denied by the FCC as it would have stripped Stockton of its lone very high frequency (VHF) television station and there were already several television channels allotted to the Bay Area. The company did announce it would add a studio in San Francisco on a secondary basis. This studio was located in the Mark Hopkins Hotel, where the San Francisco offices were also relocated. In December 1955, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported that CBS, which coveted a VHF owned-and-operated station to serve San Francisco but had affiliate KPIX-TV there instead, was bidding on KOVR.

As time went on, it became clear that a network affiliation was necessary to provide KOVR with adequate programming and secure its economic viability. Bob Foster, the media critic for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in San Mateo, described the station as &quot;suffering from the lack of sponsors, the lack of network affiliation—at least one that meant anything—and from a lack of good programs&quot;. The station found itself paying for films and syndicated programs at San Francisco market rates while selling advertising at rates befitting its city of license, the much smaller Stockton; if it were to move out of the San Francisco market, it could cut its film acquisition costs by half. KOVR had no prospect of obtaining a network alliance in the San Francisco market. However, opportunity lay in Sacramento. By 1956, there were three television stations in Sacramento itself. On the VHF band were CBS affiliate KBET-TV (channel 10) and NBC affiliate KCRA-TV (channel 3), which had begun the year before, and a UHF station, KCCC-TV (channel 40), which was the local outlet for ABC and had been in service since 1953. As not all television sets could receive UHF, UHF stations were generally at a disadvantage to VHF stations, which networks and advertisers preferred to air their programming. In a bid to obtain the ABC affiliation while eliminating overlap to ABC-owned KGO-TV in San Francisco, KOVR filed in August 1956 to move from Mount Diablo to Butte Mountain near Jackson in Amador County, a proposal that blindsided KCCC-TV. This application was initially approved by the FCC in November, though KCCC-TV management protested the decision as a Stockton station encroaching on the Sacramento market. As a result, the FCC stayed its grant of the construction permit in January 1957.

KOVR blindsided KCCC-TV again in February 1957 when it announced that, beginning February 17, it would become an ABC affiliate, something that the network had previously promised KCCC-TV as not forthcoming until after the Butte Mountain move was approved. The relocation application was granted again in April after KCCC-TV withdrew its opposition.

On May 31, 1957, KCCC-TV ceased broadcasting in what amounted to a partial merger with KOVR. The Stockton station became the ABC affiliate of record for Sacramento—already simulcasting many ABC programs with channel 40—as KCCC-TV owner Lincoln Dellar purchased stock in Television Diablo. The move to Butte Mountain became effective on October 28, 1957, taking KOVR out of conflict with the Bay Area television stations and cementing its status as a Stockton station serving Sacramento instead of San Francisco.

===Gannett and Metromedia ownership===
As work continued on the Butte Mountain transmitter, Television Diablo began to seek a buyer for KOVR. It first proposed to sell the station to the Hudson Valley Broadcasting Company of Albany, New York—which was in the process of buying a television station in Durham, North Carolina, and renaming itself the Capital Cities Broadcasting Company; despite the FCC&#x27;s approval, this sale was not consummated and was dismissed in November. Weeks later, the Gannett Company of Rochester, New York, entered into an agreement to acquire the station, taking ownership in February 1958. For Gannett, KOVR was far-flung compared to its other media properties. It owned radio and television stations in New York and Illinois as well as newspapers in those states, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The next year, KOVR reopened KCCC-TV&#x27;s former Sacramento studios on Garden Highway, also providing use of the facilities by new educational station KVIE.

After less than two years of ownership, as well as the end of talks between Gannett and 20th Century Fox, Gannett applied to sell KOVR to the Metropolitan Broadcasting Company, owned by John Kluge, in 1959. This company renamed itself Metromedia in 1961. During Metromedia&#x27;s ownership of KOVR, the station participated in the Trans-Tower project that built a common transmission facility for Sacramento&#x27;s three commercial television stations in Walnut Grove. Expanding production of commercials and other programming in Sacramento eventually led KOVR to leave the Garden Highway facilities and renovate a former Red Heart bakery on Arden Way to serve as its Sacramento studio and news center, operating alongside the Miner Avenue plant in Stockton.

===The McClatchy years===
On October 4, 1963, Metromedia announced it would sell KOVR for $7.65 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to McClatchy Newspapers, publisher of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; and &quot;The Modesto Bee&quot; newspapers and owner of radio stations KBEE (970 AM) in Modesto and KFBK (1530 AM) and KFBK-FM 92.5 in Sacramento. For McClatchy, the contract to buy a television station serving Sacramento fulfilled a long-held dream of the company. McClatchy had desired to build a station in Sacramento since 1948, when it applied for channel 10. While an FCC examiner&#x27;s initial decision favored McClatchy for the station, its competition, a group known as Sacramento Telecasters and consisting of non-broadcast interests, successfully objected the award on diversification of media ownership grounds, with the FCC unanimously overturning the examiner and granting Sacramento Telecasters the permit for what signed on as KBET-TV. McClatchy continued legal action to try and force a rehearing on its proposal until February 1958.

Several groups expressed concern about concentration of media ownership. The sale was initially opposed by a group calling itself the Citizens Committee to Promote Fair Coverage, which felt that a McClatchy purchase of KOVR would result in a &quot;monopoly of news&quot;, while the Stockton city council, fearful of the station reducing its presence in its city of license, initially voted unanimously to request an FCC hearing before rescinding the resolution after Eleanor McClatchy wrote to the body, assuring them that the station would not leave. The FCC initially indicated the deal would require a hearing, an action recommended by commission staff, but reversed course in July 1964, approving the acquisition on a 5–2 vote.

McClatchy&#x27;s ownership of KOVR was dogged by groups seeking to force the matter on antitrust issues as early as the late 1960s. In 1969, McKeon Construction, a Sacramento firm, asked a U.S. district court to void the FCC&#x27;s 1964 approval of the sale, which it claimed enhanced an existing monopoly on regional advertising; McClatchy sources told &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine that the firm&#x27;s ire had likely been provoked by unflattering coverage of its owner and of political pressures placed by Sacramento construction companies. The lawsuit was dropped in 1971. Similarly, in 1974, the San Joaquin County Economic Development Association appealed to the FCC and asked it to review whether KOVR was adequately serving Stockton.

===Cross-ownership woes===
A new tenor taken by federal regulators toward cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations significantly escalated the public pressure on McClatchy to act. In 1975, the FCC moved to bar future acquisitions that created cross-ownership and ordered 16 such groups in small markets to break up their holdings, though others were allowed to remain grandfathered. Two years later, on March 1, 1977, a federal appeals court amplified the policy; instead of merely barring future purchases against the rule, it ordered the divestiture of all such pairings except those that were in the public interest.

Within days, McClatchy announced an agreement with Multimedia, Inc., designed to extricate both groups from their heaviest cross-ownership burdens. Where McClatchy owned a newspaper, AM, FM, and TV stations between Sacramento and Stockton, Multimedia had a similar situation in Greenville, South Carolina: two newspapers (morning daily &quot;The Greenville News&quot; and the afternoon &quot;The Greenville Piedmont&quot;), WFBC and WFBC-FM radio, as well as WFBC-TV, an NBC-affiliated TV station. McClatchy and Multimedia proposed a straight trade whereby the former would acquire WFBC-TV and Multimedia would receive KOVR; as a result, neither company would own a newspaper and a TV station in the same market. Petitions were lodged against the deal by organizations in Greenville and Sacramento, as well as the San Joaquin Communications Corporation. The former two groups emphasized the unfamiliarity of the companies to their new markets, calling McClatchy &quot;totally foreign&quot; to upstate South Carolina and Multimedia &quot;completely unknown to the Sacramento community&quot;. The latter had been in a legal battle since 1974 seeking to wrest KMJ-TV in Fresno from McClatchy control. While the community organizations abandoned their opposition to the trade, San Joaquin Communications Corporation refused to yield, and the transaction reached its deadline date of March 1, 1978, without being adjudicated by the FCC. Negotiations to extend the term failed, and the deal was called off by mutual agreement later that month.

McClatchy entered into an agreement to sell KMJ-TV to the San Joaquin Communications Corporation in May 1979, seeking to avoid a lengthy legal battle over the Fresno outlet. The company then decided to put KOVR, its only other television station, up for sale. Citing &quot;increasingly strong government opposition&quot; to cross-ownership, president C. K. McClatchy II noted that he felt it was in the community interest to ensure an &quot;orderly transition&quot; of ownership at KOVR.

===Changing ownership, falling ratings===
On July 5, 1979, McClatchy announced it would sell KOVR to The Outlet Company of Providence, Rhode Island, for $65 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). C. K. McClatchy noted that Outlet was selected despite not making the highest offer because it had committed to ensuring local minority ownership in KOVR by selling 10 percent of the station&#x27;s stock to minorities. The deal, consummated in May 1980, was the second-most expensive single-station TV station transaction ever at the time. To reduce debt incurred in the KOVR purchase, Outlet sold 91 department stores. During Outlet ownership, ratings for KOVR&#x27;s newscasts fell to third place, behind KXTV and far behind a dominant KCRA. This occurred despite an infusion of resources to improve KOVR&#x27;s news ratings.

The Outlet sale was the first in seven different ownership transactions involving KOVR between 1980 and 1996. In what was the second-largest group station deal for its time, in 1983, Outlet was purchased by the Rockefeller Group after Coca-Cola walked away from a purchase agreement the year before. After the Rockefeller purchase, KOVR became the first station in Northern California to broadcast in stereo sound, doing so in February 1985. It also became the first local broadcast home of the newly relocated Sacramento Kings basketball team in 1985.
In a management buyout that restored Outlet Communications to separate status, Rockefeller Group sold the firm in 1986 for $625 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). To raise capital, some stations were immediately divested, among them KOVR, which was sold on for $104 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to another Rhode Island concern, Narragansett Capital Corporation, as its first television property. Amidst these two transactions, KOVR laid off 10 employees, and morale was low due to poor ratings in part attributable to the national underperformance of ABC at the time. The Kings telecasts had been one of the station&#x27;s bright spots, but the team sued KOVR in August 1986 for breach of contract, alleging the station owed it hundreds of thousands of dollars and had tried to renegotiate the pact; it was another three years before a judge ruled in favor of the Kings. Also in 1986, the station broke ground on its present transmission tower, a mast in Walnut Grove, in a joint venture with KXTV. Otherwise, Narragansett—a holding company, not a broadcasting firm—generally underinvested in KOVR; one rival broadcaster commented that the company had &quot;stripped the station clean&quot;.

===AnchorMedia ownership and move to West Sacramento===
In 1988, Narragansett received between seven and eleven offers, all unsolicited, for KOVR, and it opted to cash out by selling the station to AnchorMedia, a broadcasting company owned by Texas billionaire Robert Bass, for $162 million (equivalent to $ in dollars)—a price considered to be &quot;top dollar&quot;. The Bass Group had been making major business investments in Sacramento, including a purchase of land in Roseville and the acquisition of the insolvent American Savings and Loan in Stockton. AnchorMedia sued Narragansett for allegedly withholding information and taking away key employees.

The immediate task facing AnchorMedia management was one of procuring a new facility, as the Arden Way site had become overcrowded and insufficient for KOVR&#x27;s needs. Outlet had bought land in Natomas for a potential new studio site, but Narragansett sold the parcel; Anchor began scouting property in West Sacramento. In late 1990, the new $8 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), facility opened, featuring two studios and a helipad for the station&#x27;s news helicopter.

===River City and Sinclair ownership; affiliation switch to CBS===
In 1994, AnchorMedia—by then known as Continental Broadcasting—was purchased by River City Broadcasting, a St. Louis-based owner of television and radio properties. The three ABC affiliates owned by Anchor represented River City&#x27;s first major network affiliates. River City found itself navigating an affiliation switch shortly after its purchase. Amid a major national realignment, the A. H. Belo Corporation and ABC renewed their agreement for Belo&#x27;s ABC-affiliated stations in Dallas and Norfolk, Virginia, including the move of ABC&#x27;s Sacramento affiliation to the higher-rated KXTV. As a result, KOVR aligned with CBS. The switch took place on March 6, 1995.

Uniquely for the market, KOVR adopted an early prime time schedule and air weeknight CBS programming from 7 to 10 p.m. instead of from 8 to 11 p.m. At the time, KPIX-TV, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, programmed on a similar basis (abandoning the practice in 1998), and KCRA-TV had done so with NBC programming between 1991 and 1993. The early prime move was designed to help KOVR&#x27;s ratings by airing its late news for one hour at 10 p.m. and counterprogramming the 11 p.m. newscasts with &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. River City Broadcasting president and KOVR interim general manager Rick Blangiardi had previously been the general manager of KPIX and saw the scheduling practice as an opportunity. For the seventh time in 16 years, KOVR was sold again in 1996 when River City Broadcasting was acquired by Sinclair Broadcast Group of Baltimore.

===CBS ownership===
By 2004, Sinclair was eyeing the creation of duopolies in as many markets as possible and seeking to sell stations in markets where it had no feasible options to create one. One of those markets was Sacramento. As a result, Sinclair agreed to sell KOVR to the Viacom Television Stations Group—the owned-and-operated stations division of CBS—in December 2004 for $285 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). This created a duopoly with then-UPN affiliate KMAX-TV (channel 31). In order to remain under ownership limits for radio stations in Sacramento, Viacom sold San Francisco radio station KFRC (610 AM).

While operations of KMAX-TV moved in with KOVR in West Sacramento, resulting in the layoffs of 11 newly redundant employees, $7 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) was spent on capital improvements at the studios, where some of the equipment had not been replaced since AnchorMedia built the facility 15 years prior. Though speculation emerged at the time of the sale that CBS might abolish the early prime scheduling that KOVR had used for a decade, thereby bringing the station in line with its other West Coast outlets, CBS ultimately preserved the practice and even expanded it by shifting weekend programming up an hour in 2006.

==News operation==
Local news started with the station in 1954; the original news department consisted of three full-time employees and a part-time photographer, with Mel Riddle as news anchor and editor. In the early years, the station provided extensive film footage of events and used its remote vans to cover such events as flooding in Marysville.

Traditionally, KOVR&#x27;s newscasts placed third in the Sacramento market. At times, not even KXTV and KOVR combined could equal KCRA-TV&#x27;s news ratings. Newscasts were produced from both the Stockton and Sacramento studios, and the geographic distance between the news crews sometimes hampered the functioning of the news operation. Even though KOVR&#x27;s news budget often exceeded that of KXTV, KOVR typically tied that station or was narrowly edged out.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, despite a general lack of investment from Sinclair—which stripped the station of its helicopter and satellite truck and abandoned having a weeknight sports anchor—and a comparatively underresourced position, the lean KOVR news operation began to show signs of improvement and increased ratings. In 1994, longtime KCRA-TV anchor Stan Atkinson moved to KOVR and presented the station&#x27;s weeknight newscasts until his retirement in 1999.

As part of Viacom&#x27;s remake of KOVR&#x27;s news department, Sam Shane, a former KCRA-TV anchor who spent two years at MSNBC, was hired to anchor the station&#x27;s newscasts, and personnel were shuffled on other programs; a 4 p.m. newscast was also added. Between 2006 and 2010, KOVR surpassed KXTV in morning and early evening news.

In addition to its morning, noon, and evening news offerings, the KOVR-KMAX news operation produces &quot;Good Day&quot; (formerly &quot;Good Day Sacramento&quot;) for KMAX. By 2019, KOVR was also airing an 11 p.m. late local newscast.

As part of a rollout of streaming news channels across the CBS station group, CBSN Sacramento (now CBS News Sacramento) began operating on June 16, 2021.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
Though it does not host any additional subchannels, KOVR is part of Sacramento&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) deployment on KQCA, which began operating in July 2021.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KOVR shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25.

<text>The .460 Weatherby Magnum is a belted, bottlenecked rifle cartridge, developed by Roy Weatherby in 1957. The cartridge is based on the .378 Weatherby Magnum necked up to accept the  bullet. The original .378 Weatherby Magnum parent case was inspired by the .416 Rigby. The .460 Weatherby Magnum was designed as an African dangerous game rifle cartridge for the hunting of heavy, thick skinned dangerous game.

Prior to the Weatherby&#x27;s arrival, the .600 Nitro Express had been the most powerful cartridge but the .460 Weatherby Magnum eclipsed this, and was the world&#x27;s most powerful commercially available sporting cartridge for 29 years until the advent of the .700 Nitro Express.

The .460 launches a bullet at a chronographed velocity of from a barrel, measuring of muzzle energy.

==Cartridge history==
Roy Weatherby had expected the .378 Weatherby Magnum to make some headway in the African continent but believed that his cartridge was being bypassed for low-velocity, big-bore cartridges by professional hunters who he felt were resistant to change. Furthermore, new regulations prohibiting the hunting of heavy, thick skinned, dangerous game with sub-.40 caliber (10.16 mm) cartridges were being enacted in some African countries. These regulations would essentially ban the use of all previous Weatherby cartridges for the hunting of elephant, African Cape buffalo and rhinoceros.

In response to these factors, Weatherby believed that it was necessary to provide hunters a Weatherby cartridge that could be used to hunt African dangerous game in the countries which had legislated against hunting with sub-.40 caliber rifles. He accomplished this by necking up the .378 Weatherby Magnum case to accept a .458 caliber bullet. He named the new cartridge the &quot;.460 Weatherby Magnum&quot;. The first rifles for the .460 Weatherby Magnum were built on Brevex Magnum Mauser action.

However, Weatherby was not the first cartridge designer to neck up the .378 Weatherby Magnum to .45 caliber (11.6 mm). That distinction belongs to John Buhmiller, a gunsmith and hunter from Montana. Buhmiller named his cartridge the &quot;.45 Weatherby&quot;. He had success with the cartridge in Africa shooting Cape buffalo and rogue elephants in 1956, a year before Weatherby began work on his own .45-caliber cartridge.

Norma Precision of Sweden was the first and only manufacturer of .460 Weatherby Magnum cases and ammunition which carried the Weatherby name and has done so under contract from Weatherby. During Weatherby&#x27;s partnership with J.P. Sauer/Dynamit-Nobel, production at Norma ceased and shifted to RWS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynamit-Nobel. However, RWS did not tool up in time to produce the .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge and in the end only produced substandard .300 Weatherby ammunition before production once again moved to Norma.

DuPont at one time shipped DuPont No. 4350 powder to Norma Projektilfabrik for the reloading of Weatherby ammunition. But some time later Norma was able to source a powder with similar burn characteristics locally which was used instead of DuPont&#x27;s IMR 4350. Norma would later purchase the company and rename the powder Norma 204.

==Design and specifications==
The .460 Weatherby Magnum is no longer considered a proprietary cartridge as the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI) established voluntary specifications for the cartridge in January 1994. The Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (CIP) has also provided specifications for the cartridge to which all member states must comply when exporting, importing or manufacturing ammunition.

=== Cartridge design ===
The .460 Weatherby Magnum case uses a necked up .378 Weatherby Magnum case. Although the .378 Weatherby Magnum case was inspired by the .416 Rigby case, it is considered a unique case which has gone on to serve as the parent cartridge of several high performance cartridges. The .460 Weatherby Magnum requires a case with the large propellant capacity necessary to propel a bullet at . To accomplish this design goal, the cartridge case has a capacity able to hold 141.1 gr. of water (9.17 cm3). Frequently the powder charges for the .460 Weatherby Magnum can weigh well in excess of ; in comparison a powder charge for the .458 Winchester Magnum rarely weighs over .

The .460 Weatherby Magnum is designed to headspace on its belt. The close chamber tolerance of Weatherby rifles indicate that these rifles do indeed headspace on the belt rather than the shoulder, unlike most modern belted cartridges which headspace on the shoulder regardless of the belt; the few exceptions being the .375 H&amp;H Magnum and the .300 H&amp;H Magnum. SAAMI recommended chamber dimensional tolerance range does allow for the headspacing to take place on the shoulder if need be.

=== Cartridge dimensions and specifications ===
:SAAMI compliant .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge schematic: All dimensions in inches [millimeters].

Diagram reflects SAAMI dimensions for the .460 Weatherby Magnum. CIP dimensions for the r1 (inside shoulder radius), r2 (outside shoulder radius), L1 (height from base to shoulder), L2 (height from base to neck), S (shoulder angle intercepts the center line) and the α dimensional value (shoulder angle) conflict with SAAMI dimensions. This is due to how the L1 and L2 values are defined in relation to the centers of the r1 and r2 dimensional values by CIP. The following table provides the conflicting values provided by SAAMI and CIP.

Like all Weatherby cartridges, the .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge has a double radius shoulder where the body and the neck are connected with a continuously curving shoulder; the curve of which reverses at the point of tangency. SAAMI defines the length to the shoulder as the demarcation point where the bottom of inside curvature radius (corresponding roughly to CIP&#x27;s r1) of the shoulder begins and the length to the neck as where the outside curvature radius (approximating CIP&#x27;s r2) meets the neck. However, CIP does not define the location of the centers of the r1 and r2 whereas SAAMI provides this as being in inline with the length to the shoulder (inside radius) and length to neck (outside radius). This is due to the CIP treatment of r1 and r2 values as fillet radii as they do with many other cartridges.

=== Chamber dimensions and specifications ===
:SAAMI compliant .460 Weatherby Magnum chamber schematic: All dimensions in inches [millimeters].

SAAMI recommends a maximum chamber pressure rating of while CIP provides a maximum chamber pressure rating of .

Weatherby no longer provides a long leade (freebore) for the cartridge. Currently Weatherby provides of freebore for the .460 Weatherby in the Weatherby Mark V rifle. CIP recommends that rifling commence at from the case mouth reflecting the longer leade provided by Weatherby in the early 1960s. SAAMI recommends the present leade provided by Weatherby of .

Twist rate is given as 1 in 16 by Weatherby which would stabilize bullets up to and mono-metal bullets. Weatherby provides a six-groove contour No. 4 barrel for the .460 Weatherby Magnum. Ø land is given at and Ø groove is . The recommended land arc width by both SAAMI and CIP is .

==Performance==

The .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge is very accurate despite its size. Weatherby guarantees a 1.5 MOA (44mm/100m) accuracy for this cartridge in a Weatherby rifle. Typically a full-metal-jacketed or monolithic solid type bullet will penetrate more than when impacting a dangerous game animal such as the Cape buffalo or African elephant. The .460 Weatherby Magnum has few peers for stopping dangerous African game.
Compared to its contemporaries, the 460 Weatherby Magnum has more energy at 150 yards than the .458 Winchester Magnum does at the muzzle and at 100 yards more energy than the .458 Lott with factory ammunition. The .460 Weatherby Magnum provides a significant step up in performance over other production .458 caliber (11.6 mm) cartridges. The increased performance is realized in terms of both remaining energy and extended range.


The .460 Weatherby Magnum, like the .375 H&amp;H Magnum, is a relatively flat shooting cartridge. The maximum point blank range (MPBR) for the Weatherby load is . The Weatherby factory ammunition has a maximum point blank range of . These trajectories compare well with those of the .375 H&amp;H Magnum. At Hornady&#x27;s Interlock .375 H&amp;H Magnum&#x27;s bullet drops while Hornady&#x27;s DGX bullet drops . In contrast the .460 Weatherby Magnum&#x27;s (B460450TSX) drops and the (H460500FJ) drops . The .460 Weatherby Magnum, however, averages over 75% greater energy than the .375 H&amp;H Magnum.

Compared to the more popular .458 Winchester Magnum and the .458 Lott, the .460 Weatherby Magnum provides a flatter trajectory, dropping less than at when sighted in at with the 450 gr. Barnes TSX Weatherby ammunition. With the FMJ or RN Weatherby ammunition bullet drop is at the same range. The .458 Winchester Magnum and the .458 Lott have a and MPBR respectively in comparison. The FMJ or RN Weatherby ammunition shoot to the same point of impact, which is necessary in a dangerous game cartridge as hunters may need to switch from solids to soft round nose rounds depending on the circumstances and game being hunted. This is due to Weatherby&#x27;s (Norma) factory loaded ammunition using Hornady&#x27;s DGS and DGX bullets which have identical G1 ballistic coefficients of .295.

The ability of the .460 Weatherby to carry the energy and velocity required to take heavy, tough skinned dangerous game combined with the flatter trajectories it provides, gives the shooter the ability to take game species at longer ranges than its competition. The stand-off ability assures a greater margin of safety when hunting dangerous game species as the hunter need not get as close to the game as with other cartridges. Furthermore, this lessens the need to compensate for bullet drop and target size. However, for practical reasons, most dangerous game are shot at close ranges of less than .

Bullets available for the .460 Weatherby Magnum range from . Velocities with these bullets vary from with the bullet to with the bullet. The good sectional density and ballistic coefficients of these bullets, particularly spitzer bullets available, give the cartridge the ability to conserve velocity in flight and provide deep penetration on game. The wide range of bullet weights available and the ability tailor the performance the .460 Weatherby Magnum gives the cartridge a performance envelope unmatched by most cartridges. The combination of velocity and bullets of very good sectional density contributes to the .460 Weatherby Magnum&#x27;s excellent penetration on game provided the toughest bullets are employed for the task.

As with other most other cartridges, the Weatherby&#x27;s performance with mono-metal bullets is slightly poorer than with conventional bullets. Mono-metal bullets tend to be longer for a given bullet weight than conventional lead core bullets. For this reason, the mono-metal bullets similar to the Barnes TSX may have to be seated more deeply into the case displacing volume which could be filled with the propellant. A loss of velocity of can be expected with these mono-metal bullets. Likewise bullets which have a higher specific gravity than lead, such as the tungsten core Speer African Grand Slam solids being shorter than conventional FMJ bullets will allow for more powder capacity and therefore a higher velocity.

The performance level of the Weatherby cartridge comes at a cost: recoil. The recoil of the .460 Weatherby Magnum is severe. The cartridge generates close to of energy. This is in keeping with Newton&#x27;s Third Law of Motion: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. As performance levels rise, so does the recoil. Put into perspective the recoil of the .460 Weatherby is 120% greater than the .375 H&amp;H Magnum, 50% greater than the .458 Winchester Magnum and 20% greater than the .458 Lott.

The .460 Weatherby Magnum compares well with the classic English big bore cartridges; it exceeds all these cartridges in velocity, energy, trajectory and penetration. Cartridges such as the .500 Jeffery, .500 Nitro Express, .505 Gibbs, .577 Nitro Express, .600 Nitro Express do however provide a larger diameter bullet while the latter two cartridges are also capable of launching heavier bullets than the .460 Weatherby Magnum. At present only the &quot;modern&quot; classic .700 Nitro Express exceeds the performance of the .460 Weatherby and then in only a single category: energy. Cartridges such as the .475 A&amp;M Magnum, .500 A-Square, and the .550 Magnum which are based on the .460 Weatherby Magnum can exceed the performance of the parent cartridge, however, these are considered wildcat and proprietary cartridges.

==Sporting use==
The .460 Weatherby Magnum is primarily a thick skinned dangerous game cartridge designed to provide the ultimate in stopping power against African elephant, African buffalo, hippopotamus and the rhinoceros. When loaded to its full potential it has little use outside this primary use - although it can be used to hunt any species, there are far better cartridge choices for other game animals.

===Thick-skinned big game===
When loaded to its full potential it has more than the required energy necessary to drive bullets into the elephant&#x27;s vital organs from any angle provided that the bullet is up to the task. Generally, elephants require solid bullets especially when head-shots are taken. Monolithic bullets such as the A-Square Monolithic Solid, Barnes Banded Solid, Supreme Nosler Solid and more conventional tougher FMJ bullets such as the Hornady DGS are good choices as they are able to withstand stresses placed on the bullets by the velocity of the .460 Weatherby Magnum. At the mark, the .460 Weatherby has enough remaining energy and velocity to make quick kills on elephant. At this range its impact energy is comparable to that of the .458 Winchester Magnum at However, as elephant hunting is usually a close range affair where 90% of the shooting situations fall within the fact that the .460 Weatherby can fell an elephant at long ranges is mostly an academic argument at best.

Bullets in the range are excellent for African cape buffalo and rhinoceros. A combination of solids and expanding bullets may be used against these big game. Expanding bullets should be of the controlled expansion variety. Rapidly expanding bullets are to be avoided. A-Square Dead Tough, Barnes TSX, Hornady DGX and similar toughly constructed expanding bullets are recommended. As with the solid bullets, expanding bullets for the cartridge should be rated to perform well at .460 Weatherby velocities.

The .460 Weatherby is one of the very few rifle cartridges approved by the International Whaling Commission for the harvesting of whales. The cartridge was deemed to have the penetration necessary to penetrate to the brain stem to provide a quick kill on whales. The Makah people of the Pacific Northwest have used this rifle cartridge for decades hunting whales.

===Other big game===
The .460 Weatherby is overly powerful for lion or leopard. Lion are thin skinned and weigh no more than while leopards weigh no more than . When the .460 Weatherby is used for hunting leopard or lion, a rapidly expanding bullet is normally used. Bullets ideal for lion or leopard begin with the bullets. A-Square&#x27;s Lion Load, a fragmenting soft point is one such load appropriate for the big cats. Apart from the A-Square Lion Load bullets ranging in weight from are better used on lion and leopard. Since the .460 Weatherby can drive these bullets at over , and the large felidae are susceptible to hydrostatic shock, these lighter weight bullets in relation to the caliber may provide the best option if the .460 is chosen for the big cats. However, as no mainstream ammunition manufacturer loads these bullets, tailoring such loads for lion or leopard is strictly an option available only to the handloader or for those willing to have custom ammunition made to order.

The capability of the .460 Weatherby Magnum to hold flatter trajectories with appropriate bullets provides the cartridge the ability to take African plains game at distances beyond with no holdover adds to the versatility of .460 Weatherby Magnum as an all round African game cartridge. However, while the .460 Weatherby has the capacity to take such game species, there can be little doubt of the fact that there are more suitable cartridge choices for these species with far less recoil.

North American big game also does not require the full power of the .460 Weatherby Magnum. Harvesting of bison, elk, moose and brown bear can however be accomplished by reducing the performance of the cartridge to match the requirements. The .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge has the flexibility to be loaded to duplicate the performance of the .45-70 Government to the .450 Rigby - and have significantly lower recoil.

== Rifles and ammunition ==
Due to the recoil energy and recoil velocity of the cartridge rifles designed for the .460 Weatherby Magnum and other cartridges in its class demand particular attention with regard to their design. Most modern rifles designed for cartridges of this class incorporate design features that reduce the felt recoil to the shooter and improve durability. Rifles chambered for the .460 Weatherby Magnum require close mating of metal to stock. This can be accomplished by properly bedding the action to the stock. Recoil lugs and crossbolts serve the purpose of preventing a movement differential between the action and the stock which could lead to further loosening between the action and the stock or splitting the stock. Proper bedding and properly installed recoil lugs and crossbolts can go a long way in preserving the integrity of the firearm chambered in cartridges such as the .460 Weatherby Magnum as functional implements.

The Weatherby Mark V is the most popular rifle chambered for the .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge. The rifle stock is engineered to minimize the felt recoil of heavy recoiling cartridges. The California Style Monte Carlo stock&#x27;s slanting comb will under recoil push away from the shooter&#x27;s face. The rifle stock is also designed with a generous cast off to help tame the heavy recoil of the .460 Weatherby Magnum. The rifle uses an aluminum bedding block and recoil lugs to prevent any movement between the stock and the action. At a point of time the .460 Weatherby Magnum was offered for sale as an over the counter item in a few Mark V rifle lines, however, at present it is only available in the Mark V Deluxe. The Weatherby Custom Shop does offer the rifle in a few lines such as the Crown Custom, Dangerous Game Rifle (DGR) and the Safari Custom. All the over the counter and custom shop rifles are built on the Mark V action which is regarded by many as one of the strongest rifle actions available. The first .460 Weatherby&#x27;s were built on Magnum Mauser actions but these were found wanting due to the higher pressures generated by Weatherby cartridges. The Mark V action is able to contain pressure.

A-Square currently offers rifles chambered .460 Weatherby Magnum in the Hannibal (right handed) and Caesar (left handed) lines. The rifles are based on the Enfield P14 design and like the Weatherby&#x27;s are designed to minimize felt recoil. The rifles are ruggedly build to perform well with hard recoiling cartridges such as the .460 Weatherby Magnum, .500 A-Square, .577 Tyrannosaur. Dumoulin Herstal of Belgium manufactures rifles for the cartridge in their proprietary A2000/LM Long Magnum Mauser action White Hunter rifle line. The Dumoulin White Hunter is also available in .416 Rigby, .500 Jeffery and 505 Gibbs. Apart from these companies, several custom rifle maker such as Ballard Arms and Empire Rifles provide custom rifles in this chambering.

Weatherby ammunition is billed as &quot;Ultra Velocity Ammunition&quot; by Weatherby. Typically, Weatherby cartridges exhibit velocities greater than over the more popular similar caliber cartridges. Early Weatherby ammunition was loaded to near maximum pressures. Since then, however, Weatherby has backed off from these pressures. The resulting factory ammunition is about slower than early Weatherby Ammunition.

Currently ammunition is available from A-Square, Conley Precision Cartridge and Weatherby (Norma) among others. Factory ammunition is loaded with bullets. Factory ammunition are relatively expensive costing between $6.00 and 8.50 per cartridge.

==Accessories==
Although most elephant guns are equipped with open sights the typical Weatherby Mark V rifle chambered for the .460 Weatherby Magnum does not come equipped with open sights. Instead they are drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The cartridge&#x27;s performance even at leaves enough energy necessary to bring down large dangerous thick skinned game. At these ranges, telescopic sights have a greater advantage than open sights. The stock itself is designed for with the intent of providing the shooter a higher line of sight which is consistent with the use of telescopic sights.

Weatherby rifles such as the Dangerous Game Rifle and other Weatherby factory custom offerings are provided with open sights. Open sights tend to sight in quicker than scoped rifles and for this reason open sighted rifles are preferred by hunters for back-up work—when the hunter or guide must mount and discharge their firearm to ensure a charging game animal does not injure a client or to deliver a killing blow to a wounded game animal. It also has the added benefit of preventing the hunter from getting their eyebrow cut by the scope, which is not uncommon with a firearm with as much recoil as the .460 Weatherby Magnum.

The recoil of the .460 Weatherby Magnum presents a problem for many shooters when shooting a cartridge of this size. Even with a rifle (scope, base, rings and cartridges included) the recoil against the shooter&#x27;s shoulder is measured at . Most rifles chambered in .30-06 Springfield develop an average of of free recoil. Recently Weatherby has offered some reduced loads in the range, in order to be more forgiving to shooters. The recoil of the full-power loads is very punishing and if the gun has a scope, scope cuts on the forehead are common. A factory powder charge for this cartridge is about .

For many years the Weatherby Mark V rifles chambered in .460 Weatherby were equipped with Pendleton muzzle brakes to help alleviate the effects of recoil. The Pendleton muzzle brake is an integral braking system installed by porting the rifle barrel and once cut into the barrel cannot be reversed. All current Weatherby Mark V rifles chambered for the .378 Weatherby Magnum and its derivatives are provided with the Accubrake as a standard accessory with the rifle package. The Accubrake reduces felt recoil by about 53%. Unlike the earlier Pendleton muzzle brake, the Accubrake is a removable, screw-on type brake. The use of muzzle brakes is frowned on by the hunting community in particularly in guided hunting situations involving dangerous game. Since the Accubrake is a removable accessory, it can be reserved for sighting in. According to Weatherby, the removal of the Accubrake will not change the point of impact.

==Handloading==

As factory loaded ammunition for the .460 Weatherby Magnum is optimized for only heavy dangerous game, reloaders gain a great benefit from reloading for the .460 Weatherby Magnum. Reloading the .460 Weatherby Magnum is no more difficult than reloading any other belted magnum cartridges. The reloader has a wide variety of components, bullets and powders available.

Among bullet manufacturers Barnes, Hornady and Lyman provide reloading data in their manuals for the .460 Weatherby Magnum. Powder manufacturers Accurate Arms, Hodgdon and Norma have also provide reloading data for the cartridge.

===Bullets===
The .460 Weatherby Magnum accepts bullets. There are a large variety of bullets manufactured which are suited for the .460 Weatherby. Bullets weighing between are acceptable although the cartridge performs best with bullets weighing between . The bullets are optimized for use with the .45-70 Government cartridge. Such bullets are used with reduced loads. All major bullet manufacturers produce bullets that can be used in the .460 Weatherby.

In addition bullets there are several hard cast diameter bullets that are compatible with the .460 Weatherby Magnum. Such bullets, unlike jacketed bullets, are designed to be driven at reduced velocities. Driving these bullets at .460 Weatherby velocities can cause lead to be deposited in the barrel. Regular cast bullets are not recommended with the .460 Weatherby as the upper end of the permissible velocities for these cast bullets is lower than the lowest velocities obtainable from the .460 Weatherby Magnum.

===Powders===
The .460 Weatherby performs at its best with medium slow burning powders especially with heavier bullets. Usual powder charges start in excess of . Due to the large capacity case, charges less than 90% load density are not usually recommended. Hangfires with cartridges such as the .460 Weatherby are extremely unpleasant. Powder charges with higher load densities provide more reliable burn performance than lighter charges.

For reduced velocity reloads powders such as Accurate Arms&#x27; AA8700 and Hodgdon&#x27;s H870 have performed well. With AA8700 and H870 there remains a large quantity of un-burnt powder. Faster powders occupy less volume; so a filler such as Dacron is used to hold the powder charge against the primer to provide shot to shot consistence and reliable ignition.

===Cases===
At present there is one single manufacturer of .460 Weatherby Magnum brass: Norma Precision. Norma Precision manufactured brass is headstamped as Weatherby (as opposed to Norma) as they are under contract by Weatherby to manufacture Weatherby Ammunition. Weatherby brass is available from Weatherby.

===Primers===
When Roy Weatherby began working with the .378 Weatherby Magnum, the parent cartridge of the .460 Weatherby Magnum, he found the primers of the day to be unreliable. Roy Weatherby contacted Charles L. Horn, the founder of Federal Cartridge Company and explained his problem. Horn&#x27;s reply was &quot;We&#x27;ll make you a primer that, by God, will set your powder ablaze&quot;. The Federal 215 primer was developed for the .378 Weatherby Magnum cartridge and is the only primer which is generally recommended for use with the .460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge. This primer was created specifically to provide reliable ignition for compressed powder charges in large capacity cases. All reloading manuals provide loading data using only this particular primer to develop reloading data for the .460 Weatherby Magnum.

In a pinch the Winchester WLRM primer or primers with similar brisance may be substituted. The Federal 216 primer is not available for sale to the reloader at present but should the primer become available it may be substituted for the Federal 215 primer. This primer was developed for the .470 Nitro Express and is currently used by Federal to load the cartridge.

===Dies===
Full length and neck sizing dies are available from RCBS and Redding. A full-length die set is available from Hornady Manufacturing. Most two-die set includes a bullet seating die and either a full-length resizing die or a neck sizing die. A full-length sizing die reforms the complete body of the case to specification. The neck sizing die reforms only the neck so that it can hold the bullet in place. Neck-sizing cases rather than full length sizing cases can extend the case life of cartridges. On the downside, cases that are only neck sized may not feed through some actions reliably especially when used in semi-automatic rifles. Cartridges which are intended for semi-automatics should be full length resized. Most Weatherby manufactured rifle chambers are machined to very tight tolerances making full length resizing has little effect on extending the case life as the cartridge brass does not have to be worked as much to reform it. If once fired cases are to be used in a rifle in other than one it which it had been previously fired full length resizing the cases is the norm.

==Criticism==
On paper the .460 Weatherby Magnum has better penetration than most other rifle cartridges including the .577 Tyrannosaur, .585 Nyati, .600 Overkill and the Nitro Express line of cartridges. However, the .460 Weatherby Magnum was beset by penetration issues from the beginning. Safari hunters had variously reported the round nose bullets&#x27; fragmenting and the solids&#x27; deforming and core separation which lead to poor terminal performance on heavily boned animals. In such cases, the energy of the bullet is expended through the work performed deforming or disintegrating the bullet rather than directed towards the more productive penetration which is the sole reason for the use of these solid bullets.

Early Norma factory ammunition loaded for Weatherby used Hornady RN and FMJ. Norma had been loading these bullets to a velocity of . Norma dropped the velocity of the cartridge to while Hornady introduced the mechanically locked-in lead core InterLock bullets in 1980 to improve the terminal ballistics of their bullets. Subsequently, Hornady introduced the InterBond FMJ (IB-FMJ) and RN (IB-RN) bullets which featured a brass jacket with a welded lead core. The IB-FMJ and IB were loaded by Norma for the Weatherby cartridge. These Hornady .458 caliber round nose and solid bullets were later found to have a performance envelope of not exceeding in the .458 caliber.

Hornady has since developed the copper-clad steel-encased bonded core DGX and DGS bullets rated for a velocity of . The new Hornady DGX and DGS bullets are now being loaded by Norma at the reduced velocity of to coincide with the velocity rating of the tougher DGS and DGS bullets. Hornady&#x27;s performance envelope for the .458 caliber DGX and DGS bullets are between and the same rating they had assigned earlier to the more lightly constructed InterLock bullet.

While poor penetration due to bullet construction was not limited to the .460 Weatherby Magnum, the issue was more magnified in this cartridge than others due to the additional stress imposed on the bullet by the higher velocity of the cartridge as is the case with the .375 H&amp;H Magnum cartridge firing the solids at . Using premium, stoutly constructed premium solid bullets similar to the Barnes Banded Solid, Hornady DGS, Nosler Solid, Speer African Grand Slam Solid and others have resolved this problem.

==Parent cartridge==
The large case capacity of the .460 Weatherby Magnum lends itself to various forms of conversion and experimentation. The .460 Weatherby Magnum has served as the immediate parent cartridge of several proprietary and wildcat cartridges. It is, however, also correct to list the .378 Weatherby Magnum as the parent cartridge for these cartridges as the .460 Weatherby Magnum itself was based on the .378 Weatherby Magnum case.
The following are some of the better known cartridges based on the .460 Weatherby where the .460 acted as the direct parent cartridge:

; .460 A-Square Short
:The cartridge is a proprietary cartridge designed by Arthur Alphin of A-Square. This .458 caliber (11.6 mm) cartridge is based on a shortened .460 Weatherby Magnum case which can be used in a standard length action rifle. The cartridge is capable of developing when firing a bullet at .

; .465 H&amp;H Magnum

:The cartridge was designed by Russell Wilkins and Holland &amp; Holland and released in 2003. The cartridge is capable of firing a .46 caliber (11.7 mm) bullet at . This cartridge is designed to work at moderate pressures.

; .475 A&amp;M Magnum

:The .475 A&amp;M Magnum is a .47 caliber (12 mm) wildcat cartridge designed by the Atkinson &amp; Marquart Rifle Company of Prescott AZ. It is based on the .460 Weatherby Magnum necked up to accept a diameter bullet. The .475 A&amp;M Magnum is capable of launching a at for energy.

; .500 Whisper

:The .500 Whisper was designed by J.D. Jones of SSK Industries. It is based on a shortened .460 Weatherby Magnum case which is then necked up to accept a VLD bullet. It is capable of firing a at .

; .50 Peacekeeper
:This cartridge is another one of J.D. Jones&#x27; designs. It is essentially a .460 Weatherby Magnum necked up to accept a , diameter VLD bullet which it is capable of firing at for energy.

; .500 A-Square

:The .500 A-Square is another proprietary cartridge designed by Arthur Alphin of A-Square based on the .460 Weatherby Magnum necked up to accept a diameter bullet. The .500 A-Square is capable of achieving energy with a bullet launched at .

<doc id="1061669" wikidata="Q499083" url="?curid=1061669" title="Renaissance Latin">
<text>Renaissance Latin is a name given to the distinctive form of Literary Latin style developed during the European Renaissance of the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries, particularly by the Renaissance humanism movement. This style of Latin is regarded as the first phase of the standardised and grammatically &quot;Classical&quot; Neo-Latin which continued through the 16th–19th centuries, and was used as the language of choice for authors discussing subjects considered sufficiently important to merit an international (i.e., pan-European) audience.

== Ad fontes ==

&quot;Ad fontes&quot; (&quot;to the sources&quot;) was the general cry of the Renaissance humanists, and as such their Latin style sought to purge Latin of the medieval Latin vocabulary and stylistic accretions that it had acquired in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire. They looked to golden age Latin literature, and especially to Cicero in prose and Virgil in poetry, as the arbiters of Latin style. They abandoned the use of the sequence and other accentual forms of metre, and sought instead to revive the Greek formats that were used in Latin poetry during the Roman period. The humanists condemned much of the large body of medieval Latin literature as &quot;Gothic&quot;—for them, a term of abuse—and believed instead that ancient Latin from the Roman period had to form the basis for judging what was a grammatical and accurate style of Latin.

Some 16th-century Ciceronian humanists also sought to purge written Latin of medieval developments in its orthography. They insisted, for example, that &quot;ae&quot; be written out in full wherever it occurred in classical Latin; medieval scribes often wrote &quot;e&quot; instead of &quot;ae&quot;. They were much more zealous than medieval Latin writers that &quot;t&quot; and &quot;c&quot; be distinguished; because the effects of palatalization made them homophones, medieval scribes often wrote, for example, &quot;eciam&quot; for &quot;etiam&quot;. Their reforms even affected handwriting; Humanists usually wrote Latin in a humanist minuscule script derived from Carolingian minuscule, the ultimate ancestor of most contemporary lower-case typefaces, avoiding the black-letter scripts used in the Middle Ages. This sort of writing was particularly vigilant in edited works, so that international colleagues could read them more easily, while in their own handwritten documents the Latin is usually written as it is pronounced in the vernacular. Therefore, the first generations of humanists did not dedicate much care to the orthography till the late sixteenth and seventeenth century. Erasmus proposed that the then-traditional pronunciations of Latin be abolished in favour of his reconstructed version of classical Latin pronunciation, even though one can deduce from his works that he himself used the ecclesiastical pronunciation.

The humanist plan to remake Latin was largely successful, at least in education. Schools taught the humanistic spellings, and encouraged the study of the texts selected by the humanists, to the large exclusion of later Latin literature. On the other hand, while humanist Latin was an elegant literary language, it became much harder to write books about law, medicine, science or contemporary politics in Latin while achieving the higher standards of grammatical accuracy and stylistical fluency. Scholar Jürgen Leonhardt noted how these high standards changed speakers&#x27; relationship with the language: &quot;Whereas during the Middle Ages, Latin had an instrumental function in human communications and in peoples&#x27; understanding of the world, for the humanists, the act of mastering the language became a measure of human self-perfection. In the end, the most important difference between medieval and humanist Latin may well have been the time and effort to learn it.&quot;

<doc id="1061674" wikidata="Q4833613" url="?curid=1061674" title="B'nai Brith Canada">
<text>B&#x27;nai Brith Canada ( ; BBC; from ) is a Canadian Jewish service organization and advocacy group. It is the Canadian chapter of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith International and has offices in Toronto, Winnipeg, Montreal, and Vancouver. 

==Mission==
The organization presents the following mission statement, as stated in the preamble to its constitution:

B&#x27;nai Brith has taken upon itself the mission of uniting person of the Jewish faith in the work of promoting their highest interest and those of humanity; of developing and elevating the mental and moral character of the people of our faith; of inculcating the purest principles of philanthropy, honour and patriotism; of supporting science and art; alleviating the wants of the poor and needy; visiting and caring for the sick; coming to the rescue of the victims of persecution; providing for, protecting and assisting the aged, the widow and the orphan on the broadest principles of humanity.

==Early history==

In 1875, Lodge No. 246, located in Toronto, was the first lodge founded in Canada, followed soon after by another in Montreal. Many community leaders were associated with these lodges. Over time, a team of dedicated volunteers and professional staff emerged.

==20th century to present==
In September 2014, Ontario lawyer and former Conservative Party candidate Michael Mostyn was appointed CEO of B&#x27;nai Brith Canada, succeeding Frank Dimant upon his retirement after 36 years with the organization. Mostyn continued as CEO until February 2025, when he died from cancer. Judy Foldes became Acting CEO in February 2024 when Mostyn went on leave to undergo cancer treatment.

=== Role in the 2007 by-election ===
During the 2007 by-election in Outremount the group accused Jocelyn Coulon of being anti-American and anti-Israel because of his views on the Hamas-Israel-Lebanon conflict. The Quebec-Israel Committee however, stated that B&#x27;Nai Brith&#x27;s statements were exaggerated and that Coulon had every right to be the Liberal candidate. These issues were thought to be important because the Jewish community in Outremont made up 10% of the riding population.

=== Criticism of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission ===
In January 2004, Shahina Siddiqui, executive director of the Islamic Social Services Association, filed a formal complaint against B&#x27;nai Brith Canada under the &quot;discriminatory signs and statements&quot; section of the Manitoba Human Rights Code. After speaking with several people who attended a Winnipeg conference on terrorism hosted by B&#x27;nai Brith Canada in October 2003, she wrote that the event was biased against Muslims and would encourage the response teams in attendance to engage in racial profiling. The Manitoba Human Rights Commission (MHRC) accepted the complaint and began an investigation that would last five years. In 2009, the MHRC issued a report that dismissed the complaint due to a lack of evidence. MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters subsequently wrote that &quot;the full investigation of the complaint that took place was warranted&quot; and that &quot;the decision was based solely on the insufficiency of the evidence with respect to this particular section of the Human Rights Code.&quot;

In 2008, David Matas, B&#x27;nai Brith&#x27;s senior counsel, sharply criticized the MHRC for its conduct during the investigation, stating that: &quot;The [Manitoba] Human Rights Commission itself is supposed to be promoting human rights, but in our view in this process it&#x27;s violating some pretty basic rights: a secret proceeding, a faceless accuser, failure to disclose documents. These are basic procedural rights that are being violated.&quot; Writing in the &quot;National Post&quot;, Joseph Brean made several criticisms of the investigation: The MHRC accepted the complaint despite the fact that the complainant, Shahina Siddiqui, did not actually attend the event. B&#x27;nai Brith Canada was never told of the identity of the individuals whose claims Shahina Siddiqui based her complaint on. It has never been revealed what exactly is alleged to have been said at the conference. Tracy Lloyd, an MHRC investigator, spoke with seven anonymous witnesses, including one as late as November 2006. However, only one, a City of Winnipeg employee, shared Siddiqui&#x27;s criticism that the conference was &quot;one-sided.&quot; One of the witnesses, a diversity relations officer, stated that it was &quot;pretty professional,&quot; and said police in general are capable of putting almost anything they hear into proper context. The MHRC commissioned a &quot;secret expert report&quot; but refused B&#x27;nai Brith&#x27;s request to know the expert&#x27;s identity, mandate or material provided. The secret report has not been made public.

Following the release of the MHRC report, Matas accused MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters of taking a contradictory position, stating that: &quot;So what they&#x27;re saying is that a full investigation is warranted even when there&#x27;s no evidence, as long as the accusation is within the jurisdiction of the board. There&#x27;s a lot of problems with this. What basically happened is that Siddiqui heard a rumor. She makes a complaint, as a result of which the commission goes on a five-year fishing expedition. They don&#x27;t find anything. We&#x27;re co-operating with them. And then they dismiss the complaint. That&#x27;s not a proper procedure, in my view.&quot; Matas also criticized the procedures of the MHRC, stating that they will &quot;take an allegation, without evidence, and just run with it to see if it&#x27;s true.&quot; The previous year, Matas in a submission in a Moon Report on Internet hate speech, Matas charged that Canada&#x27;s human rights commissions have demonstrated &quot;a disastrous combination of investigative zeal and substantive ignorance.&quot; Although Matas stated that he does not believe Siddiqui acted in bad faith, he added that: &quot;The people who run these procedures have to have a more objective viewpoint than the people who make the complaint.&quot;

=== Hassan Diab complaint ===
In July 2009, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada issued a press release denouncing Carleton University for hiring Hassan Diab, who was alleged by French authorities to have been responsible for the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing. Diab was living under virtual house arrest at the time (he had been granted bail but under very strict conditions) due to an extradition request from France. Within a few hours of the B&#x27;nai Brith Canada complaint, Carleton University announced that it would &quot;immediately replace the current instructor, Hassan Diab&quot; in order to provide students &quot;with a stable, productive academic environment that is conducive to learning.&quot; B&#x27;nai Brith executive vice-president Frank Dimant later stated that &quot;the university did the right thing.&quot; In November 2014, Hassan was extradited from Canada to France where he was imprisoned for 3 years and two months while the investigation continued. Since then, four French anti-terrorism judges have uncovered testimony from several individuals stating that Diab was in Lebanon at the time of the bombing as well as university records which show he wrote and passed exams in Beirut then and couldn&#x27;t have been in Paris. In January 2018, French authorities dropped all charges against Hassan Diab, citing lack of evidence.

=== Hassan Guillet controversy ===
In 2019, B&#x27;nai Brith unearthed a series of controversial comments and social media posts made by Hassan Guillet, a parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Party in that year&#x27;s Canadian federal election. When B&#x27;nai Brith went public with its findings, the Liberal Party dropped Guillet as a candidate.

=== Lobbying against Islamophobia Bill ===
B&#x27;nai Brith lobbied against certain wording in the non-binding parliament bill M103. Bill M103 denounces Islamophobia and other type of hates. The bill was introduced after the killing of 6 Muslims at a Quebec mosque by an extreme-right sympathizer 

=== Free speech conference ===
Continuing on with the free speech advocacy, B&#x27;nai Brith organized a free-speech conference with free-speech advocacy and alt-right groups. The conference was scheduled to be hosted at a synagogue, but some Jewish groups asked the synagogue to cancel the events after concerns about alt-right and Islamophobic groups taking part.

==Members==
According to an article in &quot;The Forward&quot;, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada had 4,000 full-dues paying members in 2007. Membership is restricted to those of the Jewish faith.

===Governance and financial issues===
In 2007, a group calling itself Concerned Members of B&#x27;nai Brith Canada charged that a new constitution had been passed despite a majority of members having voted against it at a general meeting. Henry Gimpel, a former Toronto lodge president, told &quot;The Forward&quot; that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s too much of [B&#x27;nai Brith Canada] being run by one person.&quot; Frank Dimant, CEO of BBC, responded to the criticism over the constitution by saying that BBC followed proper governance procedures and that B&#x27;nai Brith International&#x27;s Court of Appeal determined that the constitution was properly enacted. Gimpel and seven other BBC members were expelled in June 2008 for what a disciplinary committee determined to be &quot;conduct unbecoming a member.&quot; Gimpel referred to the committee as a kangaroo court.

On July 8, 2015, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Dimant has demanded an annual retirement payout of $175,000, representing 75% of his former salary, which the B&#x27;nai Brith believes is too lucrative and will require the struggling charity to direct fundraising dollars to pay for Dimant&#x27;s pension. Dimant has stated that the payout was approved by the organization&#x27;s board, however, the &quot;Star&quot; cites an unnamed source as stating that the deal was arranged with little oversight while Dimant was still in charge. In the year following Dimant&#x27;s retirement, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada put its &quot;state of the art&quot; care facility for Alzheimer&#x27;s patients under insolvency protection while also trying to sell it. The project, initiated and led by Dimant, is a $16 million facility opened in 2013 but that been unable to attract enough patients, due to high fees for patients of $7,500 a month and the fact that it was not designed to be wheelchair accessible; the facility is losing $50,000 a month and owes $11 million to creditors.

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article also claimed that other issues left by Dimant&#x27;s former management of B&#x27;nai Brith are a lack of records and record keeping and failure to always issue charitable tax receipts and poor corporate governance with approximately 50 people who had believed they were on various boards of B&#x27;nai Brith organizations learning that this is not the case, as Dimant&#x27;s management had failed to file the correct paperwork with government agencies.

Due to financial difficulties, including a decline in charitable donations in recent years, B&#x27;nai Brith also ceased publication of its newspaper, &quot;Jewish Tribune&quot; in 2015, and is selling its headquarters which carries two mortgages totalling nearly $4 million, though the building itself is assessed at slightly over $3 million. It was reported by &quot;The Forward&quot; in 2007 that the organization was struggling financially and mortgaged its head office in order to raise $850,000 to meet expenses. In 2015, the organization indefinitely suspended publication of &quot;Jewish Tribune&quot; and announced the sale of its heavily mortgaged headquarters at 15 Hove Street.

== Defamation lawsuits ==

=== Luba Ferdorkiw lawsuit ===
Luba Fedorkiw a candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party in Winnipeg during the 1984 general election, sued B’nai B’rith Canada after a local newspaper reported that it was investigating allegations that she had made antisemitic comments. The investigation ultimately revealed no evidence of antisemitism. Fedorkiw was awarded $400,000 in damages, which at the time was one of the largest damage awards in Canadian legal history.

=== Lesley Hughes lawsuit and settlement ===
In 2008, the Liberal Party of Canada dropped as a candidate and revoked the membership of Winnipeg Centre candidate Lesley Hughes after she was accused on antisemitism by the group, the Canadian Jewish Congress and Conservative MP Peter Kent over a 2002 article about the 9/11 attacks. Hughes later filed a lawsuit for defamation against B&#x27;nai Brith, the Canadian Jewish Congress and Peter Kent. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed settlement amount. The parties issued a public statement stating that Hughes is not an antisemite, stating that Hughes “does not condone the use of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories by racist groups to support antisemitism of any nature&quot;. 

=== Dmitri Lascaris lawsuit and settlement ===
Lascaris is a lawyer, activist, and was formerly the Green Party’s Justice critic. In 2016, Lascaris expressed sympathy for a man whose family home was demolished by Israeli authorities after his son had been extrajudicially killed by the Israeli forces for being an alleged terrorist. B’nai Birth published an article and tweet alleging that Dmitri Lascaris “advocates on behalf of terrorists.” Lascaris sued B&#x27;nai Brith for defamation.

B’nai Brith attempted to block the lawsuit using Ontario&#x27;s legislation to prevent strategic lawsuits against public participation (anti-SLAPP). It was successful in Ontario’s Superior Court, but that decision was overturned by the province’s Court of Appeal.The Supreme Court did not grant leave to appeal the Ontario Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision, clearing the way for the defamation lawsuit to go to trial. In 2021, the matter was settled out of court with B’nai Brith deleting the materials complained of, and its insurer compensating Lascaris for his legal fees.

=== Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) lawsuit and settlement ===
In 2018, CUPW sued B’nai Brith for suggesting that the union supported terrorism in newsletters and Facebook posts because it had co-operated with Palestinian postal workers. B’nai Birth tried to have the case dismissed using Ontario’s anti-SLAPP legislation, which is designed to block lawsuits intended to stifle speech and legitimate criticism of matters of public interest. However, B’nai Birth lost its motion to have the case dismissed in both Superior Court, which noted that B’nai Brith&#x27;s defence “is not a ‘slam dunk’ — to the contrary, there are significant issues about truth, good faith, responsibility and malice.” This decision was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed settlement amount and B’nai Birth apologized for the harm its publications may have caused CUPW and its members.

=== Other ===
In 2022, Javier Davila, an educator at the Toronto District School Board, sued B’nai Brith and its CEO, Michael Mostyn, for defamation. The alleged defamation included statements that Davila had &quot;attempted to abuse&quot; his position in the school board to &quot;spread hateful propoganda&quot;.

In 2023, B&#x27;nai Brith launched a defamation lawsuit against David Mivasir, a rabbi who is a pro-Palestinian activist, for, among other things, describing B&#x27;nai Brith as an &quot;anti-Palestinian hate group.&quot; B&#x27;nai Brith later withdrew its legal action.

==Initiatives==

===Publications===
B&#x27;nai Brith Canada owned and operated the weekly &quot;Jewish Tribune&quot; as a subsidiary publication. The newspaper claimed a circulation of over 62,000 copies a week which would make it the largest Jewish publication in Canada. Publication was suspended in early 2015.

===Hezbollah terror designation===
On November 29, 2002, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada sued the Canadian government for &quot;failing to crack down on the fundraising efforts of Hezbollah&quot;, by not adding Hezbollah&#x27;s charity wing to the list of banned terrorist organizations; the paramilitary wing of Hezbollah, the Jihad Council, was already listed, but not its political wing. About a week later, the Canadian government made the decision to designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.

===Anti-hate hotline===
B&#x27;nai Brith Canada operates a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week &#x27;Anti-Hate Hotline&#x27;. The hotline receives calls from those who feel they have suffered from antisemitism or discrimination and is one of the sources of the organisation&#x27;s statistics for its Annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents.

=== Radical Islam advertisement ===
On November 9, 2009, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada ran a full page ad in the &quot;National Post&quot; comparing radical Islam with Nazism. Frank Dimant, CEO of B&#x27;nai Brith, said &quot;overall, feedback from the ad has been very positive.&quot; At the same time, the ad drew the ire of the group Canadian Jewish Holocaust Survivors and the Canadian Association of Jews and Muslims, and has also led to accusations of racism and Islamophobia against the organization.

===Investigations of antisemitism in the media===
In February 2016, the organization revealed that the Windsor, Ontario newspaper &#x27;al-Forqan&#x27; called for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as &quot;sacred duty of jihad&quot;. In July 2016, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada, organization with the London Police Services, investigated &#x27;al-Saraha,&#x27; a London, Ontario newspaper for Holocaust denial.

<text>JBIG is an early lossless image compression standard from the Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group, standardized as ISO/IEC standard 11544 and as ITU-T recommendation T.82 in March 1993. It is widely implemented in fax machines. Now that the newer bi-level image compression standard JBIG2 has been released, JBIG is also known as JBIG1. JBIG was designed for compression of binary images, particularly for faxes, but can also be used on other images. In most situations JBIG offers between a 20% and 50% increase in compression efficiency over Fax Group 4 compression, and in some situations, it offers a 30-fold improvement.

JBIG is based on a form of arithmetic coding developed by IBM (known as the Q-coder) that also uses a relatively minor refinement developed by Mitsubishi, resulting in what became known as the QM-coder. It bases the probability estimates for each encoded bit on the values of the previous bits and the values in previous lines of the picture. JBIG also supports progressive transmission, which generally incurs a small overhead in bit rate (around 5%).

== Patents ==
Doubts about patent licence requirements for JBIG1 implementations by IBM, Mitsubishi and AT&amp;T prevented the codec from being widely implemented in open-source software. For example, as of 2012, none of the commonly used web browsers supported it. Since 2012, there are now no more JBIG1 patents in force – the last ones to expire were Mitsubishi&#x27;s patents in Canada and Australia (on 25 February 2011) and in the United States (on 4 April 2012).

<doc id="1061676" wikidata="Q1761747" url="?curid=1061676" title="Motuca">
<text>Motuca is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The population is 4,795 (2020 est.) in an area of 229 km2. The elevation is 618 m. The municipality was created on January 20, 1990. 

== History ==
The first records of settlement in Motuca date back to 1892, with the construction of the Rincão/Bebedouro Railway by the Companhia Paulista de Estrada de Ferro.

The area, abundant in water resources, received cattle drivers and their herds from distant regions. The junction of the railway with the cattle trail was natural, as both cattle and coffee were unloaded there. Coffee, after traveling a long way to the port of Santos, was destined for the European market.

Like many other areas in the state of São Paulo, Motuca had its golden period with coffee cultivation and cattle raising. Around 1908, Japanese and Portuguese immigrants settled and developed activities related to horticulture and coffee farming.

The effective agricultural growth spurred political and administrative development, and on December 31, 1925, it became a district of the municipality of Araraquara. After the 1950s, other crops were replaced by sugarcane cultivation, which gradually took over small farms and sites, leasing land and attracting migrants from the northeastern region.

From that period onwards, there was slow economic development, and only on January 9, 1990, did it gain political and administrative autonomy with the creation of the municipality. The municipality&#x27;s name comes from a type of fly of the same name, common in the region due to the large amount of water there.

== Football ==
Founded on January 5, 1971, Motuca Futebol Clube is the main local football club.

== Geography ==
Motuca has an area of 228.7 km².

== Demography ==

<text>The .17 Remington / 4.4x45mm is a rifle cartridge introduced in 1971 by Remington Arms Company for their model 700 rifles.

==Overview==
The .17 Remington is based on the .223 Remington case necked down to .172 in (4.37 mm), with the shoulder moved back.

Extremely high initial velocity (over 4,000 ft/s 1,200 m/s), flat trajectory and very low recoil are the .17 Remington&#x27;s primary attributes. It has a maximum effective range of about on prairie dog-sized animals, but the small bullet&#x27;s poor ballistic coefficients and sectional densities mean it is highly susceptible to crosswinds at such distances.

The smaller .172 bullet typically has a much lower ballistic coefficient than other typical varmint calibers, such as that of the .223 Remington. Because of this, the .172 bullet loses velocity slightly sooner and is more sensitive to wind; but by no means does this render the cartridge useless. The tiny entrance wound and usual lack of exit wound on coyote-sized animals make it an ideal round for fur bearing animals from which the hunter intends to collect a pelt. A significant disadvantage is the rapid rate at which such a small-caliber rifle barrel can accumulate gilding metal fouling, which is very detrimental to accuracy and may also eventually result in increasing pressures caused by the fouling&#x27;s constriction of the bore. Many .17 Remington shooters have reported optimum accuracy when the bore is cleaned after every 10 - 20 shots, though more modern metallurgy used in both barrels and bullets has largely mitigated the fouling issue.

The .17 Remington is also one of the few cartridges in which powder charge weight is often greater than bullet weight. Though this condition has been known to degrade accuracy, the .17 Remington is noted for exceptional accuracy.

<text>Massie Township, one of the eleven townships of Warren County, Ohio, United States, is located in the northeast part of the county and is the least populous of Warren County&#x27;s townships. The population was 1,195 as of the 2020 census. It is the home of the Ohio Renaissance Festival and Caesar Creek State Park.

==Geography==
Located in the northeastern part of the county, it borders the following townships:
*Chester Township, Clinton County - northeast
*Washington Township - south
*Adams Township, Clinton County - southeast
*Wayne Township - northwest

The village of Harveysburg is the only municipality within the township.

==History==
Massie Township was organized in 1850, and named for General Nathaniel Massie.

A large part of the township was submerged in the 1960s and 1970s with the damming of Caesars Creek by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

==Public services==
The township is mostly in the Clinton-Massie Local School District but a part is in the Wayne Local School District.

Massie Township is in the Waynesville and Clarksville telephone exchanges.

Massie Township Fire Department, a volunteer fire department, serves Massie Township. It is composed of sixteen firefighters based at a single station.

<text>The .221 Remington Fireball (5.7x35mm), often simply referred to as .221 Fireball, is a centerfire cartridge created by Remington Arms Company in 1963 as a special round for use in their experimental single-shot bolt-action pistol, the XP-100. A shortened version of the .222 Remington, it is popular as a varmint and small predator round while also finding use among target shooters. It has application as both a pistol round and as a rifle round.

== History ==
In the early 1960s Remington was working on an experimental bolt-action pistol based on their Model 600 action. The goal was a highly accurate pistol that would be well suited for competition. After working with the .222 Remington they determined that it contained more powder capacity than was necessary to work efficiently in the shorter barrels of pistols. While rifle barrels commonly range in length from , pistol barrels are typically much shorter, ranging from although occasionally up to for some competition barrels. As a result, Remington decided to develop a shorter version of the .222 Remington cartridge, optimized for use in the XP-100.

While production of XP-100 pistols chambered in .221 Fireball was eventually canceled after 1985, Thompson Center Arms produced various single-shot pistols chambered for the .221 Fireball as part of their Contender and Encore models. Rifles chambered for the .221 Fireball include the Remington 700 and the Ceska zbrojovka CZ 527.

== Performance ==
Despite its smaller size, the .221 Fireball is capable of velocities nearly equal to that of the .222 Remington largely due to its higher SAAMI pressure. The maximum SAAMI pressure level for the .221 Fireball is 52,000 C.U.P. as compared to 46,000 C.U.P. for the .222 Remington. The purpose of the increased pressure was to allow it to perform more effectively in the shorter barrel of the XP-100.

The .221 Fireball produces the highest velocity of any commercial pistol cartridge.

== Offshoots ==
The .221 Fireball has been used by wildcatters to create a small efficient .17 caliber cartridge. The most common is the .17 Mach IV which is essentially the .221 necked down to the smaller caliber. This cartridge is reported to have a very flat trajectory and to be relatively quiet with low recoil. It has been so popular as a wildcat that in 2007 Remington legitimized it by introducing their version only slightly different from the Mach IV and calling it the .17 Remington Fireball. A .20 caliber version is also gaining popularity called the .20 VarTarg (VT), &quot;vartarg&quot; being the combination of the words &quot;varmint&quot; and &quot;target&quot;. The .221 Fireball has also been used as the base for the .300 Whisper, sometimes referred to as the .300/.221 or .300 Fireball. It is also the basis for other cartridges in J.D. Jones&#x27; Whisper family including the 6 mm Whisper, which has been adopted by Knight&#x27;s Armament Corporation for their Knight&#x27;s Armament Company PDW as the 6×35mm PDW.

<text>The .22 Remington Jet (5.6x33mmR) is a .22 in (5.6mm) American centerfire revolver and rifle cartridge. The round is known in the US as .22 Jet, .22 Center Fire Magnum/.22 CFM or .22 Rem Jet.

==Development==
Developed jointly by Remington and Smith &amp; Wesson, it was to be used in the Model 53 revolver, which first appeared late in 1961. While it traced its origins to potent wildcats such as the .224 Harvey Kay-Chuk, which ultimately derive from the .22 Hornet, it was a bottlenecked cartridge based upon the .357 Magnum case necked down to a .22 caliber bullet, with an unusually long tapered shoulder.

By 1972, the Model 53 remained the only revolver chambered for it, while Marlin in 1972 was planning a lever rifle in .22 Jet. The .22 Jet was also a factory chambering for the Thompson/Center Contender and the design allowed for it to reach its full potential, having no cylinder gap and no case setback.

==Usage==
The .22 Jet was designed as a flat-shooting hunting round for handguns, and it is suitable for handgun hunting of varmints and medium game out to 100 yd (90 m). The 2460 ft/s (750 m/s) and 535 ft-lbf (725 J) claimed for factory test loads did not prove out in service weapons.

<doc id="1061704" wikidata="Q2599022" url="?curid=1061704" title="Yakkity Yak">
<text>Yakkity Yak is an Australian-Canadian animated television series created by Mark Gravas for Nickelodeon. It was produced by Studio B Productions and Kapow Pictures. It aired on Teletoon (now Cartoon Network) in Canada and on the American version of Nickelodeon in the United States from 9 November 2002 until 12 December 2003. 26 episodes were produced.

The copyright to the show is shared between WildBrain, which bought Studio B Productions in 2007, and Kapow Pictures.

== Premise ==
The story focuses around an anthropomorphic yak named Yakkity who aspires to become a best-known comedian and his friends, Keo (an anthropomorphic pineapple) and Lemony (a young human girl) in the fictitious Australian town Onion Falls (based on Lithgow, New South Wales).

==Theme song==
A modified version of the 1958 song &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; by The Coasters (in which children and some cast members sing some portions) is used as the show&#x27;s theme song.

==Characters==
*Yakkity Yak (Lee Tockar): A preteen yak student in Onion Falls High School and the school&#x27;s mascot who wishes to be a comedian. Yakkity works as the school mascot since his grandfather also served as mascot when the (rugby) football team won the state championship in 1925. The football team, instead of the mascot, got all the glory (despite not winning a match in 77 years), much to Yakkity&#x27;s distaste. Yakkity lives with his Granny and her boarder Professor Crazyhair. He wears a coat over his bare body. His best friends are Keo (who lives next door) and Lemony. Over the course of the series, his parents have never been seen or mentioned.
*Keo (Brian Drummond): An anthropomorphic pineapple who is actually a human with a pineapple for a head. He has a crush on Lemony but she is oblivious to it. He is very intelligent but is camera shy and has stage fright. He has rivalries with his father, who is only a pineapple, but deep down, he loves him.
*Lemony (Andrea Libman): A pretty blonde-haired human girl and Keo&#x27;s love interest who has a vivid imagination.
*Reginald Highpants (Ian James Corlett): The town&#x27;s leading vendor of candy and all things sugar. He also runs many small businesses.
*Trilo (Jason Schombing): Yakkity&#x27;s trilobite agent and retired circus performer who owns his own Entertainment Agency, does children&#x27;s parties for the characters, and is always looking for money. His clients are Yakkity, Fairy Wanda and Chuck Damage, who he uses for parties.
*Granny Yak (Pam Hyatt): Yakkity&#x27;s grandmother. While she is a good sounding board in a parental way, she also has some of Yakkity&#x27;s impulsive genes.
*Professor Crazyhair (Scott McNeil): A scientist and teacher at Onion Falls High whose hair changes colour like a mood ring, hence his name. He lives in Yakkity&#x27;s basement, where he built a laboratory. His egg salad recipe is very sought after by evil geniuses who wish to use it to take over the world.
*Penelope (Tabitha St. Germain): A robot who is Lemony&#x27;s best friend and works as Professor Crazyhair&#x27;s assistant but lacks any social skills or confidence. Whenever she&#x27;s embarrassed, her face turns red and she squirts out fire fighting foams from her arms transforming into fire hoses, squirting everything around her.
*Rondo (Ian James Corlett): Lemony&#x27;s (rugby) football playing older brother who is a senior in high school. He is one of Yakkity&#x27;s enemies often competing for the spotlight.
*Keo&#x27;s Dad (Michael Daingerfield): A pineapple who can be bossy and rude at many times, and Keo&#x27;s father. The identity of his wife (Keo&#x27;s mother) is unknown and never explored; it can be assumed that they’re divorced or she died before the events of &quot;Yakkity Yak&quot;. He&#x27;s only a disembodied pineapple head; as the only time he ever had a body with limbs was in &quot;My Dad the Robot&quot;.
*Wanda Harper (Brenda Crichlow): an African-Australian fairy who works as Onion Falls High&#x27;s librarian.
*Jackie Pachyderm: An elephant comedian and successful movie star who is Yakkity&#x27;s idol.
*Gary (Terry Klassen): A short, evil, mean-spirited, sadistic, bad-tempered arch-enemy of Yakkity. He tried to steal Professor Crazyhair&#x27;s egg salad to take over Onion Falls. He hates Yakkity because he once again interfered in his plans and decides to use the giant robot to destroy Onion Falls.

==Telecast==
&quot;Yakkity Yak&quot; first premiered on Teletoon in Canada on 4 January 2003, with the final episode&#x27;s airing on 28 January 2004. It also aired on BBC Kids. In the United Kingdom, it aired on Nickelodeon. In Italy, it previously aired on Nickelodeon and Canale 21. In Australia, it aired on Nickelodeon and Network 10, and would later air on ABC. In the US, it briefly aired on Nickelodeon, from 9 November 2003 to 4 September 2004. It was later run on the Nicktoons channel starting from 22 May 2004 until 23 September 2007. The show also aired on Nickelodeon in Latin America and Europe.

<doc id="1061710" wikidata="Q4958772" url="?curid=1061710" title="Brazilian Society of Health Informatics">
<text>The Sociedade Brasileira de Informática em Saúde (Brazilian Society of Health Informatics), abbreviated as SBIS, is a professional society created in November 1986 in Campinas, during the First Brazilian Congress on Health Informatics. It has the mission of promoting the development and the interchange of ideas and results in the fields devoted to the information technologies applied to the health sciences (Medical informatics, Telemedicine, Bioinformatics, etc.).

==Mission and areas of interest==

SBIS is a nonprofit membership organization of individuals and institutions interested in developing and using information technologies to improve health care in Brazil. To accomplish its goal, SBIS may develop the following activities:
* Stimulate educational activities related to health informatics;
* Stimulate scientific research and technical development in Health Informatics;
* Organize conferences, symposiums, courses, seminars, and other activities that lead to experience and knowledge exchange;
* Cooperate with sister societies;
* Contribute to the definition of healthcare policies;
* Promote Health Informatics as a means to reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare services.

Some of SBIS areas of interest are:

* Health information systems
* Health information management
* Electronic patient record
* Telemedicine and telehealth
* Medical decision support systems
* Biological signal processing
* Medical image processing
* Internet applications in health
* Health information standards
* Health informatics education
* Distance education in health

Currently it has around 780 associates, thus being the third largest in the Americas, after the American Medical Informatics Association and the Canada&#x27;s Health Informatics Association, and the largest in Latin America, according to the International Medical Informatics Association. The Society is affiliated to the International Medical Informatics Association since 1988.

==Governance==

The current Executive Board (2008–2010) is led by Dr. Cláudio Giulliano Alves da Costa (President). Former presidents were: Roberto J. Rodrigues, Renato M.E. Sabbatini, Mariza Machado Klück, Beatriz de Faria Leão, Daniel Sigulem, Umberto Tachinardi, Lincoln de Assis Moura Jr. and Heimar de Fátima Marin. Short histories of Health Informatics in Brazil have been published elsewhere by former presidents of the Society.

==Conferences and Meetings==
SBIS organizes since 1986 a biannual national conference, the Brazilian Congress of Health Informatics and a biannual specialized conference on Electronic Health Records (PEP); besides other, smaller and less periodical meetings.

The Brazilian Congress on Health Informatics takes place in different cities every two years and has as its main subjects the applications of information technology and telematics to medicine, nursing, dentistry and allied health care sciences, from the point of view of the expert scientific and technical worker in these areas. The first conference was organized in November 1986, in the city of Campinas by Dr. Renato M.E. Sabbatini. The vice-president was Dr. Hugo Sabatino, and the editor-in-chief of the Conference&#x27;s proceedings was Dr. Renato G.G. Terzi, all with the Medical School at the same university. During this conference, the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics was launched, as well as the &quot;Brazilian Journal of Health Informatics&quot;. The conference was then repeated in 1988 (São Paulo), 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 (Campos do Jordão), 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 (Natal), 2006 (Florianópolis) and 2008 (Campos do Jordão). The next conference will be held in November 2010, in Porto de Galinhas, Pernambuco.

==Publications==
SBIS&#x27; flagship periodical is the on-line scientific journal, &quot;Journal of Health Informatics&quot; (Heimar Marin, Editor-in-Chief). It also publishes &quot;SBIS News&quot;, an electronic bulletin hosted by Yahoo! Groups (Renato M.E. Sabbatini, editor-in-chief), and coordinates the SBIS-L e-mail discussion list.

==Electronic Health Record Certification Project==

In collaboration with the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine since 2007, SBIS has developed one of few programs in the developing world geared towards the software certification in the area of electronic health records. The standards for access, information security, digital certification, patient confidentiality, storage of records, etc., have been discussed together and officially approved by a number of decrees enforced by CFM and are part now of a Manual, a course for buildup of a task force of specialized consultants. The certification standards cover ambulatory healthcare, clinical laboratory and other areas, and in the future will be expanded for inpatient health records and Picture archiving and communication system.

==Professional Education==

In 2008 the Society approved the creation of a new initiative and a directorship to boost educational activities in health informatics. A website and a Learning Management System based on Moodle server were created in 2009 (address ). The site is used to support presential courses as well as to offer purely distance courses, seminars, lectures, and other educational activities. The site has also a digital library with on-line references to papers, reviews, e-books, multimedia files, etc., which are deemed useful for education and learning purposes. In addition, webconferencing facilities using DimDim have been added and can be used by associated individuals and institutions.

==Professional Certificate in Health Informatics==
In October 2009 the Society launched a program for certificating health care professionals as specialists, in a manner similar to medical specialties coordinated by the Brazilian Medical Association and the Federal Council of Medicine in Brazil. The program entails a minimum list of technical proficiency, a written and oral annual examination, and the issue of a certificate which is valid for five years. The revalidation of the certificate will be mandatory by means of continuing education credits. The Society installed also an educational accreditation program in place, for recognizing courses and curricula in health informatics, for this purpose, with a point-based system of credits. The entire program is under the responsibility of a new Directorship of Professional Education, coordinated by Prof. Renato M.E. Sabbatini.

<text>Gaylordsville is a village (neighborhood/borough) in the northwest corner of the town of New Milford, Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. It was listed as a census-designated place (CDP) prior to the 2020 census.

==History==
The early history of Gaylordsville is closely connected to the Gaylord family, early settlers in New England. In 1630 William Gaylord arrived in Dorchester, Massachusetts on the ship &quot;Mary and John&quot; along with his wife and five sons. A deacon in the puritan church, he was involved in the affairs of the colony, signing land grants and serving on the first jury in the colony. He later settled in East Windsor, Connecticut. His great-grandson, Ensign William Gaylord, moved to Woodbury in 1706 and married Joanna, the daughter of Captain John Minor. Joanna&#x27;s sister, Grace, married Samuel Grant, and was an ancestor of President Grant.

In 1712, the Gaylord couple came to New Milford, Connecticut, which had been settled only five years previously. Their house stood on the corner of Main and Elm Streets. For a time he kept a tavern there in addition to doing his regular work as a surveyor. He did a lot of surveying for the State, laying out town boundary lines, and it was, no doubt, on one of these surveying trips that he became impressed with the large areas of level land several miles north of the New Milford village, just north of the straits on the Housatonic River. He began taking title to parcels of it, and soon owned a large part of the valley. To ensure the good will of the Native Americans living in the area, he also bought it from them, giving, according to legend, a horse, a mule, and a two-wheeled cart.

In 1722, a highway was laid out &#x27;by marked trees&#x27; north from New Milford to the brook called Whemiseck. The blazed trail ran through Squash Hallow, past the straits, and over Cedar Hill. Mr. Gaylord was probably the surveyor who laid out this road, and probably put it over Cedar Hill so it would not cut into the level areas that were to become his fields.

In 1725, Mr. Gaylord travelled this trail from New Milford and built a log cabin west of the Housatonic just north of the straits. He lived in this cabin three years while he was clearing land, cutting timbers, and building his frame house, which he built in 1728. The following year his oldest son, Aaron, built a house about a quarter of a mile south of his father&#x27;s, and on the west side of the valley.

During this time the Gaylord family became good friends with their Indian neighbors, teaching them better methods of agriculture, and dickering with them for furs they could use. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Gaylord, Aaron, Joanna, Ruth, Benjamin, and Mary. Benjamin remained at his father&#x27;s home, and eventually took over the homestead. He married Tryal Morehouse on October 23, 1745.

William Gaylord died October 25, 1743, at the age of 73. His grave, and that of Mrs. Gaylord were the first ones in a cemetery that had been laid out about half a mile south of the Gaylord home.

==Geography==
Gaylordsville is located at geographical coordinates 41° 38′ 47&quot; North, 73° 29′ 5&quot; West (41.646469, -73.484673).

Gaylordsville is located in the northwest corner of New Milford. It is part of the valley known to the Native Americans as the Wheniuck or Red Plumb Plain. On the east the boundary is Quanuctnic or Long Mountain, but it has never been decided whether it should be at the foot of the mountain or somewhere up on top. The southern boundary is also vague, usually considered to be an imaginary line leaving the Housatonic River somewhere south of the Tory Cave and extending across Squash Hollow. The Sherman town line forms the western boundary, although several homes in Sherman are usually considered to be part of the Gaylordsville community.

The Housatonic River runs through the center of the village and is joined by the Wimisink, Womunshenuck, Naromiyocknowhusunkatankshunk (Morrissey), and Squash Hollow brooks. The south end of the valley is divided into two narrow valleys by Straits Mountain or Pauguiack. The north end of this overlooks the village and is called &quot;the Pinnacle&quot;. The area usually considered to be Gaylordsville is about four miles long and one mile wide.

<doc id="1061714" wikidata="Q5585004" url="?curid=1061714" title="Gordon College (Massachusetts)">
<text>Gordon College is a private Christian college in Wenham, Massachusetts. The college offers 44 majors, 55 concentrations, and 30 interdisciplinary and pre-professional minors as well as graduate programs in education, music education, public health and leadership. Gordon has an undergraduate enrollment of around 1,600 students representing more than 50 Christian denominations.

==History==
In 1889 Adoniram Judson Gordon founded the school, Boston Missionary Training Institute, in the Fenway–Kenmore neighborhood of Boston at the Clarendon Street Baptist Church to train Christian missionaries for work in what was then the Congo Free State. Progressive at its inception in 1889, the school admitted both men and women of various ethnicities. It was renamed Gordon Bible College in 1916 and expanded to Newton Theological Institution facilities along the Fenway, into a facility donated by Martha Frost in 1919. Frost, a widowed Bostonian with several properties in the city, provided a significant philanthropic gift. In 1921, the school was renamed Gordon College of Theology and Missions.

In the early 1950s, a Gordon student named James Higginbotham approached Frederick H. Prince about selling his estate to the college after learning of recent property viewings by the United Nations and Harvard University. In 1955, Gordon developed into a liberal arts college with a graduate theological seminary and moved to its present several-hundred-acre Wenham campus north of Boston. Gordon sold its Boston campus on Evans Way to Wentworth Institute of Technology. The Prince Memorial Chapel on the Wenham campus (since replaced) was named for Frederick Prince, and the Prince residence was named Frost Hall after Martha Frost.

In 1958, Gordon College instituted a core curriculum. In the 1950s it launched its first study-abroad program, European Seminar.

In 1962, the school changed its name to Gordon College and Divinity School. In 1970, the Gordon Divinity School separated from the college to merge with the Conwell School of Theology, once part of Temple University, to form the Gordon–Conwell Theological Seminary in Hamilton, Massachusetts.

Barrington College, founded in 1900 as the Bethel Bible Institute in Spencer, Massachusetts, later relocated to Dudley, Massachusetts, and then to Providence, Rhode Island. It took the name Barrington after the campus was moved to Barrington, Rhode Island, in 1959. Barrington merged with Gordon College in 1985, forming a United College of Gordon and Barrington.

=== Tuition decrease ===
In the October 2020, Gordon College announced a 33% reduction in tuition from $56.7k sticker price to $37.9k, joining two other CCCU schools in bringing tuition costs more in line with what a typical family would consider &#x27;affordable.&#x27; The college notes that this reduction is made possible due to its Faith Rising capital campaign, which has expanded its base endowment by $125 million in the past year (250%), coupled with 24% debt reduction. Scholarships will be adjusted accordingly, with current students allowed to choose which arrangement they prefer. The reduction took effect in the fall semester of 2021.

Previously, in the fall of 2019, Gordon received the largest donation in its history, an anonymous gift of $75.5 million, with additional commitments of an additional $50 million, substantially increasing an endowment of $50 million and resulting in a 15% increase in college-funded student financial aid.

===2014 discrimination controversy===
On July 1, 2014, Gordon College President D. Michael Lindsay was one of fourteen leaders of religious and civic organizations who signed a letter to U.S. President Barack Obama about an executive order he was contemplating that would prohibit federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The letter asked the president to include language that would exempt religious organizations from the executive order&#x27;s requirements, suggesting he &quot;find a way to respect diversity of opinion . . . in a way that respects the dignity of all parties&quot;. They suggested the exemption be based on language the U.S. Senate had recently added as an amendment to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). Obama did not use the ENDA amendment&#x27;s language when he issued his order on July 21 but left in place a narrower exemption established with respect to federal contractors in 2002 by President George W. Bush&#x27;s Executive Order 13279.

In response, on July 9, Salem, Massachusetts, Mayor Kimberley Driscoll ended Gordon College&#x27;s contract to manage and maintain the city&#x27;s Old Town Hall, citing a city ordinance that prohibits Salem from contracting with entities that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Gordon&#x27;s contract with the city would otherwise have expired on September 1. For similar reasons, in August, the Lynn Public Schools ended its relationship with the college, which had provided students to work without pay in the schools as part their training toward degrees in education and social work.

In late July, the Peabody Essex Museum ended its academic relationship with the Gordon museum studies program, later withdrawing its support for Gordon&#x27;s grant application to the National Endowment for the Humanities that aimed at funding an expansion of its museum studies program. In mid-September the New England Association of Schools and Colleges gave the college a year to report on how its non-discrimination policies met the organization&#x27;s standards for accreditation. At its April 2015 meeting, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges affirmed that Gordon&#x27;s accreditation remained in good standing, with no further action required by the Commission at that time.

Conservative legal organizations have offered to represent the college in lawsuits that would argue that severing ties to the school constituted retaliation for the exercise of free speech and the practice of religion. Lindsay declined those offers and later said he would not have signed the letter had he anticipated the reaction and the impact on Gordon. The school subsequently reviewed its code of conduct, which, in addition to banning sex outside of marriage, bans homosexual practice. Based on that review, Lindsay announced that &quot;its policy barring student or faculty sex out of heterosexual marriage will remain as is.&quot; In addition, Gordon College rolled out several initiatives aimed at preventing bullying of gay, lesbian, transsexual, and bisexual students.

=== Lawsuits ===
In 2015, Lauren Barthold, associate professor in the department of philosophy, filed a lawsuit against the college for retaliating against her because she publicly disagreed with the college&#x27;s President D. Michael Lindsay who sought to allow federal contractors, on the basis of religion, to discriminate against LBGTQ individuals in hiring. The lawsuit contends that the college violated state laws protecting against retaliation. As part of a joint resolution, Prof. Barthold resigned in 2016.

In 2017, the college was sued by Margaret DeWeese-Boyd, associate professor in the department of sociology and social work. DeWeese-Boyd filed a complaint in Essex Superior Court claiming that the college&#x27;s President Lindsay and Provost Janel Curry discriminated against her because of her gender and denied her promotion to full professorship for advocating against the school&#x27;s LGBTQ policies. The college filed a motion seeking a summary judgment to determine whether the ministerial exception clause barred DeWeese-Boyd from suing. In November 2019, both parties appeared before the court for a hearing and DeWeese-Boyd argued that she never worked as a minister with the college. On April 2, 2020, Judge Jeffrey T. Karp of the Massachusetts Superior Court ruled against the ministerial exception defense. This decision was appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) based on the July 2020 Supreme Court decision handed down in &quot;Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru&quot;. The SJC upheld the Superior Court decision in an opinion authored by Justice Scott L. Kafker. The United States Supreme Court declined a request to review the SJC&#x27;s decision.

A Christian multidenominational college, Gordon requires students to sign the school&#x27;s Statement of Faith, though the religious conclusions and commitments among students and faculty remain diverse. Catholics do not teach at Gordon College although some students are Catholic. All students must also sign a Life and Conduct Statement agreeing to the standards of behavior that Gordon values. Gordon College prohibits sexual relations outside marriage, homosexual practice, alcohol, tobacco, and narcotic or hallucinogenic drugs on campus and continues to uphold a dorm-visitation policy that allows for male-female visitation only during particular hours. Chapel services take place on Mondays and Wednesdays, and an academic convocation takes place on Fridays; attendance of chapel, convocation or other events (lectures, debates, presentations, films, exhibitions, etc.) is required to graduate.

==Campus==
In 2007, Gordon College dedicated its 450-acre campus property in the name of benefactors Dale E. and Sarah Ann Fowler following an unrestricted endowment promise of $60 million from their estate, which the college would receive at an undetermined future date. As of 2007, the Fowler gift (once received) was projected to triple the current endowment for Gordon College. In 2014 the Gordon endowment was $44,008,437. The Dale E. and Sarah Ann Fowler Campus at Gordon College is 25 miles north of Boston. The campus is situated on of wooded property.

<text>Trusts &amp; Estates is a wealth management journal published by Informa which covers trust law and estates. It was first published in 1904 (as a periodical called &quot;Trust Companies&quot;) under the direction of Christian A. Luhnow, who was the editor, publisher and owner of the magazine at the time.

Today, &quot;Trusts &amp; Estates&quot; publishes articles contributed by practitioners in the fields of estate planning and taxation, fiduciary professionals, family offices, insurance, investments, philanthropy, retirement benefits and valuations. According to trustsandestates.com, articles are generally peer-reviewed by an editorial advisory board. The journal is published 12 times per year with a Wealth Management Resource Guide bonus issue in December.

==History==
Christian A. Luhnow founded Trust Companies in March 1904 in response to the rise of the trust banking industry in the United States. Most of the 1,300 United States trust companies then in existence had been formed in the previous 25 years. Yet, according to the magazine back then, &quot;no other financial institutions of comparatively recent growth have made such giant strides and at the same time are so little understood outside of those immediately interested.&quot;trusts in the 1800 were used as business techniques during the industrial growth these ways were often used by large companies

<text>John Ridley Stroop (; March 21, 1897 – September 1, 1973), better known as J. Ridley Stroop, was an American psychologist whose research in cognition and interference continues to be considered by some as the gold standard in attentional studies and profound enough to continue to be cited for relevance into the 21st century. However, Christianity was the real passion of his life; psychology was simply an occupation.

==Early life==
John Ridley Stroop was born in the rural community of Hall&#x27;s Hill, outside Murfreesboro in Rutherford County, Tennessee. In poor health as an infant, his family thought that he was not going to live long so he was spared part of the heaviest farm work. Stroop was brilliant in his local county school at Kitrell, finishing the first of his class. He attended David Lipscomb High School in Nashville, graduating in 1919. Stroop then began to study at David Lipscomb College, then a two-year junior college, in Nashville, Tennessee, an institution where he would later return as a faculty member after his university doctoral work. Two years later, in 1921, he obtained his diploma from Lipscomb, graduating first in his class.

On December 23, 1921, Stroop married Zelma Dunn (1899-1988) with whom he had 3 sons. Zelma was the great-niece of Margaret Zellner, wife of David Lipscomb.

==Academic career==
Stroop spent his academic career at George Peabody College in Nashville while also teaching courses at David Lipscomb College. He received his B.S. degree in 1924 and his M.S. in 1925.

Stroop&#x27;s doctoral studies at Peabody were focused on Experimental Psychology with a minor in Educational Psychology. His research at the Jesup Psychological Laboratory and his dissertation were under the direction of Joseph Peterson. Stroop&#x27;s research was built on studies in the early 1880s by Cattell under the direction of Wilhelm Wundt to measure mental processes involving naming objects as well as reading object names. The elegance of Stroop&#x27;s research was to apply experimental rigor and a clarity of explanation that led to identification of the tested processes with his name. Stroop developed a color-word task to demonstrate interference between reading an object&#x27;s name and naming an object, and explained some of its psychological characteristics, which were later named the Stroop effect. Soon after producing his dissertation on the color-word task to obtain his Ph.D, Stroop left experimental psychology. He produced only two other papers related to the color-word task.

After obtaining his doctorate, Stroop worked briefly for the Tennessee Educational Commission and also for the Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, now Tennessee Technological University. He soon returned to David Lipscomb College, where he served as Registrar for eleven years, and then as chair of the Psychology Department from 1948 to 1964. Stroop continued to teach psychology and Biblical studies until he retired in 1967. He served one year as dean of Ohio Valley College in Parkersburg, West Virginia before returning to Lipscomb as Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies until his death on September 1, 1973.

<text>&quot;Man&#x27;s best friend&quot; is a common title given to domestic dogs, referring to their multi-millennia-long history of close relations, loyalty, friendship, and companionship with humans. The first recorded use of a related phrase is by Frederick the Great of Prussia. It was likely popularized by its use in a poem by Ogden Nash and has since become a common colloquialism.

Before the 19th century, breeds of dogs (other than lap dogs) were largely functional. They performed activities such as hunting, tracking, watching, protecting and guarding; and language describing the dog often reflected these roles. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;In the oldest proverbs and phrases dogs are rarely depicted as faithful or as man&#x27;s best friend, but as vicious, ravening, or watchful.&quot; Beginning in the 18th century, multiplying in the 19th and flourishing in the 20th century, language and attitudes towards dogs began to shift.

==Origins==
A statement describing a dog as being a man&#x27;s best friend was first recorded as being made by Frederick II, King of Prussia (1740–1786). Frederick referred to &quot;Biche&quot;, one of his Italian Greyhounds, as his best friend.

In his &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; (1764), Voltaire wrote:
:CHIEN. — Il semble que la nature ait donné le chien à l&#x27;homme pour sa défense et pour son plaisir. C&#x27;est de tous les animaux le plus fidèle : c&#x27;est le meilleur ami que puisse avoir l&#x27;homme.

Translated, this reads:
:DOG. — It seems that nature has given the dog to man for his defense and for his pleasure. Of all the animals it is the most faithful: it is the best friend man can possibly have.
The earliest citation in the US is traced to a poem by C.S. Winkle printed in &quot;The New-York Literary Journal, Volume 4&quot;, 1821:
:The faithful dog – why should I strive
:To speak his merits, while they live
:In every breast, and man&#x27;s best friend
:Does often at his heels attend.
In 1870, in Warrensburg, Missouri, George Graham Vest represented a farmer suing for damages after his dog, Old Drum, had been shot and killed. During the trial, Vest stated that he would &quot;win the case or apologize to every dog in Missouri.&quot; His closing argument to the jury made no reference to any of the testimony offered during the trial, and instead offered a eulogy of sorts. Vest&#x27;s &quot;Eulogy of the Dog&quot; is one of the most enduring passages of purple prose in American courtroom history (only a partial transcript has survived). It began:

Vest won the case (the jury awarded $50 to the dog&#x27;s owner) and also won its appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. In 1958, a statue of Old Drum was erected on the Johnson County Courthouse lawn containing a summation of Vest&#x27;s closing speech, &quot;A man&#x27;s best friend is his dog.&quot;

In 1941, Ogden Nash wrote &quot;An Introduction to Dogs,&quot; beginning:
:The dog is man&#x27;s best friend.
:He has a tail on one end.
:Up in front he has teeth.
:And four legs underneath.
==Argos and Odysseus==

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (c. 8th century BC), upon Ulysses&#x27; return disguised as a beggar, his beloved dog Argos is the only individual to recognize him.

<doc id="1061737" wikidata="Q2735268" url="?curid=1061737" title="Keith Miller">
<text>Keith Ross Miller (28 November 1919 – 11 October 2004) was an Australian Test cricketer and a Royal Australian Air Force pilot during World War II. Miller is widely regarded as Australia&#x27;s greatest ever all-rounder. His ability, irreverent manner and good looks made him a crowd favourite. Journalist Ian Wooldridge called Miller &quot;the golden boy&quot; of cricket, leading to his being nicknamed &quot;Nugget&quot;. 

A member of the record-breaking &quot;Invincibles&quot;, at the time of his retirement from Test cricket in 1956, Miller had the best statistics of any all-rounder in cricket history. He often batted high in the order, sometimes as high as number three. He was a powerful striker of the ball, and one straight six that he hit at the Sydney Cricket Ground was still rising when it hit the upper deck of the grandstand. Miller was famous for varying his bowling to bemuse batsmen: he made sparing use of slower deliveries and would often adjust his run-up, surprisingly bowling his fastest deliveries from a short run. He was also a fine fielder and an especially acrobatic catcher in the slips.

Away from cricket, Miller was also a successful Australian rules footballer. He played for St Kilda and was selected to represent the Victorian state team. He played 50 games for St Kilda, for whom he kicked eight goals in one game against North Melbourne, during 1941.

Miller&#x27;s personality – love of the contest, rather than victory, and his larger-than-life rebelliousness and carousing – helped both shape and limit his cricketing career, as he espoused the opposite of the more puritanical values of Donald Bradman, his captain and later national selector. Neville Cardus referred to Miller as &quot;the Australian in excelsis&quot;; Wooldridge&#x27;s response was &quot;By God he was right&quot;. This status was reflected when Miller was made one of the ten inaugural members of the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Born on 28 November 1919 in the western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, Miller was the youngest of Leslie and Edith Miller&#x27;s four children. He was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers Keith and Ross Smith, who were half-way through their historic flight from England to Australia at the time Miller was born. The three Miller boys played Australian rules football and cricket. Their father had been a successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique, relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford. At the age of seven, Miller&#x27;s family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne&#x27;s southeast. As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power.

At the age of 12, he was selected for an under-15 Victorian schoolboys cricket team. At the time, he stood only tall and wielded a sawn-off bat. He lacked power, but impressed with his footwork and style. Miller reasoned that, as he appeared destined to be short, a career as a jockey was more likely than one as a cricketer or footballer.

Miller attended the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was a mediocre student, but Woodfull quickly noticed his cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller was selected for the school&#x27;s first XI. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him &quot;The Unbowlable&quot;—Woodfull&#x27;s own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull&#x27;s geometry class, and was forced to repeat the year.

Keith Truscott, Miller&#x27;s school cricket captain, took him to a trial with local club side St Kilda at the start of the 1934–35 season, but Miller could not find a place in any of its five teams. Joining the local sub-district cricket club Elsternwick instead, he did not get to bat or bowl in his first match, and was dropped to the second XI for his poor fielding. Nevertheless, his teammate, former Victoria state player Hughie Carroll, spotted Miller&#x27;s talent and lured him to the rival South Melbourne club. Miller began playing for South Melbourne the following season. It was at South Melbourne that Miller met Ian Johnson and Lindsay Hassett, his future Australia captains. Miller scored 12 not out on debut, but observers felt he would succeed with a stronger physique; Woodfull wrote in the 1936 school magazine, &quot;Miller has Test possibilities&quot;.

In March 1936, Miller played for South Melbourne against Carlton, captained by Woodfull. Miller came to the crease at 6/32. He guided his team to 141, putting on a stand of 65 with the last man and finishing with 61. The crowd gave Miller a standing ovation, and newspapers him compared him to Ponsford and Alan Kippax. The Carlton team presented him with a silver eggcup, &quot;for sterling performance&quot;, which Woodfull presented to Miller during an algebra class.
==Debuts in Sheffield Shield and Victorian Football League==
During 1936, Miller underwent a sudden growth spurt, of in the year, reaching in height. This thwarted his career as a jockey. With his increased height and weight, he began to play football with more physical aggression. At the end of 1936, he completed year 10 and quit high school, taking a position as a clerk.

For the 1937–38 cricket season, Miller transferred to the VCA Colts, where he won the team&#x27;s batting trophy for having the best average. At this stage, his method of playing was slow and steady accumulation of runs. Late in the summer, he made his first-class debut for Victoria and hit 181 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1938–39, he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs at an average of 25.00. He was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield competition, having appeared only in one-off matches.

During this period, Miller achieved more success as a footballer, following his brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1937. A defender, Miller initially played on the half-back flank before moving to full back during his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he lacked the strength to hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.

Miller finally made his breakthrough in cricket in 1939–40, when he was selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He managed just four and seven, batting at number five in the order. When Victoria fielded, Miller ran out his future &quot;Invincibles&quot; captain Don Bradman. One of Miller&#x27;s teammates was Percy Beames, who was also his manager at Vacuum Oil. Miller scored 41 and 47 not out in his second match to hold his place, but against New South Wales, Miller made a pair of 14s, having difficulties against leg spin. In the return match against South Australia, Miller took the initiative against leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett, aggressively advancing down the pitch and driving. Miller reached 108, his first century in Shield competition. Apart from the century, Miller had a moderate season, ending with 298 runs at 29.80.

In the Australian winter of 1940, Miller started his fourth season in the VFA. In a match against Coburg, aged just 19, he was selected to play at full back, against the greatest forward of the era, Bob Pratt. Miller restricted Pratt to just one goal for the match, and was named best on ground. Scouts from top-tier Victorian Football League (VFL) club St Kilda signed Miller on the spot. In a match for St Kilda against Carlton, Miller was by his opponent Ron Cooper at the start of the match. When the teams next met, Miller shoulder bumped Cooper in the first minute, forcing him to leave the field. St Kilda finished second-last that season.

==War service==
Miller&#x27;s sporting career was interrupted by World War II. On 20 August 1940, he joined the Militia (army reserve), and was assigned to the 4th Reserve Motor Transport Company. In late September, Miller began his training. A non-conformist, he had the first of many clashes with authority in November, when he was fined for &quot;using insulting language to a superior officer&quot;. Miller soon lived up to the traditional nickname of &quot;Dusty&quot; for anyone called Miller, owing to his tendency to be involved in fist fights and his rambunctious persona.

During the summer of 1940–41, Miller was granted leave so that he could play interstate cricket. In a war-shortened season, Miller scored 140 runs at 28.00 and took his maiden first-class wicket. The 1941 VFL season also went ahead. Miller played in defence and attack, depending on match conditions. In 16 games, he kicked 28 goals, including eight in one match. He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation, striking his boss Beames—who played for Melbourne—with a raised elbow at the start of a match. Miller came second in St Kilda&#x27;s best and fairest for the season.

Miller&#x27;s season ended early when he was recalled to duty. He had continued disciplinary problems, and left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy. When the navy rejected his friend, Miller tore up his own paperwork, left the recruiting office, and walked around the corner to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office, where he enlisted.

Less than two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Miller was called to active service. He trained at No. 4 Initial Training School, at Victor Harbor in South Australia, and gained his wings in late 1942. He played only one match during the 1942 football season, while posted in South Australia. In December, he was promoted to the rank of flight sergeant and, a month later, he sailed to Europe. The journey included a stopover at a training camp in Boston in the United States, where Miller met his future wife Peg Wagner. In March, he was deployed to Bournemouth, in England, where he continued his training.
Miller was invited to join a RAAF team in London. The team was officially formed in preparation for the 1943 season and Miller&#x27;s selection led to the first of many brushes with death: in April, while away with the team, some of his comrades were killed in a German air strike. Miller played his first match at Lord&#x27;s against Warner&#x27;s XI, a team that featured past, current and future England players, including Bob Wyatt, Gubby Allen, Trevor Bailey and Alec Bedser. Miller top-scored in the first innings with 45 and added 21 not out, with two sixes, in the second innings. The RAAF played eight matches that season and Miller&#x27;s top score was 141 against Public School Wanderers. He went on to play for Dominions against Warner&#x27;s XI in August, scoring 32 and two. The match marked the first meeting between Miller and his good friend, England batsman Denis Compton and his bowling began to attract media attention. In the final match of the season at Lord&#x27;s between the RAAF and the Royal Air Force, Miller took 3/23 and scored 91. The success of RAAF and Dominions that season, especially the attractive batting by Miller and Keith Carmody, prompted Warner to begin planning for a &quot;Test&quot; series between the respective armed services of England and Australia.

By late 1943, Miller was based in Gloucestershire. One night, he threatened to punch his commanding officer, resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour. In mid-November, he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he trained in the used of radar. During his stay there, Miller sustained a back injury during a wrestling match: the injury was to cause him recurring and enduring problems, particularly diminishing his ability to bowl.

In 1944, Miller was again selected for the RAAF team. In a match against the British Civil Defence Services at Lord&#x27;s in July, Miller reached his century just as a V-1 flying bomb landed nearby. In a match against an , Miller scored 85 in 100 minutes. He then took match figures of 6/28 against the West of England at Bristol.

After ten months of training, Miller was offered a commission as a pilot officer, and was posted to No. 12 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit in Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 15 August 1944, then moving on to Cranfield, Bedfordshire. On a trip back to Ouston to visit former comrades, a night of drunken revelry saw Miller charged with eight offences and facing possible dishonourable discharge. Luckily for Miller, his new commanding officer (CO) was his old CO from Ouston; Miller escaped with a fine.

While training, Miller flew Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. He had another near death experience: mechanical problems forced him to make an emergency landing of his Beaufighter. The plane was repaired for use by others, but, on its next flight, the pilot was killed when the problem recurred. On another occasion, Miller avoided colliding with a hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment; a V1 bomb hit the venue and killed many of the patrons. In October, he went AWL to watch a concert and was summarily discharged, but the CO revoked his decision after Miller agreed to play for his cricket team. At the end of his officer training, Miller was sent aboard a Royal Navy destroyer as part of an exchange program between the forces. During a mission to Belgium, the vessel fought a German U-boat, which was sunk. Upon his return to England, Miller was promoted to flying officer on 4 November 1944.

In March 1945, Miller was deployed to the RAF station at Great Massingham in Norfolk, East Anglia. He was assigned to 169 Squadron, flying Mosquito fighter-bombers. Miller&#x27;s squadron took part in missions against targets on mainland Europe in April and May 1945. They attacked V-1 and V-2 production and test launch sites on the island of Peenemünde in the Baltic Sea. On 19 April, Miller took part in an attack on a German installation at Flensburg in northern Germany. In May, his squadron was deployed in Operation Fire Bash, to attack Westerland Airfield on the island of Sylt. One of Miller&#x27;s bombs failed to release and the load dangled from a wing. Miller was obliged to land the plane with the bomb still attached. Miller&#x27;s next mission was delayed by poor weather, by which time Germany had surrendered. His commanding officer ordered him to fly air force personnel over Germany to view the results of Allied bombing. On one flight, Miller broke away from the flying formation and returned to base late because he wanted to fly over Bonn, the birthplace of Beethoven.

Miller&#x27;s wartime exploits were to give him a greater sense of perspective when he returned to the sports field. When asked many years later by Michael Parkinson, about pressure in cricket, Miller responded: &quot;Pressure is a Messerschmitt up your arse, playing cricket is not&quot;.

===Victory Tests===
The end of the war prompted the belated start of the 1945 cricket season. Miller returned to Lord&#x27;s and scored 50 for the RAAF against a British Empire XI. Warner had organised a celebratory series of matches between England and Australian servicemen, known as the Victory Tests. Australian cricket administrators did not accredit the three-day matches as Tests. England was close to full strength, so the Second Australian Imperial Force and the RAAF teams merged to form the Australian Services cricket team under the leadership of Warrant Officer Hassett. The First Victory Test was at Lord&#x27;s and was expected to usher in a new post-war era, which cricket watchers hoped would be more attractive to watch. England batted first and Miller bowled his Great Massingham colleague Bill Edrich to end with 1/11 and precipitate an English collapse. Miller came to the crease at and helped Australia take the lead, before cutting loose, eventually finishing with 105 in 210 minutes. &quot;The Times&quot; opined that his innings was &quot;as good a century as has been seen at Lord&#x27;s in many a long day&quot;. Australia went on to win by six wickets.

Miller warmed up for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, provoking an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him to start taking it seriously, instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball. Despite this, Australia lost the match.

In the meantime, Miller earned the further ire of his CO by flying unauthorised leisure flights. Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, the CO ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire. With one functional engine, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The plane broke apart and caught fire, but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later.
The next day, Miller headed to Lord&#x27;s to play for the RAAF against the South of England. Chasing 208, Miller scored an unbeaten 78 in 95 minutes, but rain washed out the match. In the first innings of Third Victory Test at Lord&#x27;s, when finally called upon to bowl, Miller measured out a run-up and removed John Dewes, Donald Carr and Hutton, all bowled. He ended with 3/44. Miller was rewarded with the new ball in the second innings. He removed Dewes, Edrich and Dick Pollard to end with 3/42. This left Australia a target of 225. Miller saw Australia to the target, unbeaten on 71. In the Fourth Test, again at Lord&#x27;s, Miller scored 118 in the first innings, before an unbeaten 25 in the second innings ensured a draw. The tremendous public reception of the Victory Tests resulted in a fifth match being added to the schedule.

In the meantime Japan had surrendered, and No. 169 Squadron was disbanded. Miller had spent around 550 hours in the air with the RAF, to which his RAAF unit had been seconded. He was awarded the 1939–45 Star, France and Germany Star, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–45.

In the Fifth Victory Test, under overcast conditions against a swinging and seaming ball, Miller struck 14 from his first over and finished 77 not out, in a display that featured strong cutting and driving. Australia could manage only 173, and England were on top. Miller took one wicket with the ball but managed only four in the second innings as England won, to square the series 2–2. Hassett wrote at the end of the series that &quot;This is cricket as it should be... let&#x27;s have no more talk of &quot;war&quot; in cricket&quot;. Miller topped the batting averages for the series, with 443 runs at 63.28. His aggregate exceeded those of Hammond and Hutton, and he also took 10 wickets at 27.70. Of Miller&#x27;s batting, Hassett said that &quot;as a strokeplayer he is second to none&quot;, and his performance earned comparisons to Jack Gregory, who had a similar breakthrough after World War I.

The last big match of the season was a one-off match at Lord&#x27;s between England and &quot;Dominions&quot;, a scratch team of players from the British Commonwealth. Miller managed 26 in the Dominions&#x27; first innings of 307, before cutting loose in the second innings. After settling in, he hit Eric Hollies for two sixes, including one that hit the top of the roof. The next day, he registered his century in 115 minutes, clouting another five balls over the boundary in the morning session. In one 35-minute passage of play, he and Learie Constantine added 91 runs, before Miller departed for 185, made in just 165 minutes. The Dominions went on to win by 45 runs in a match described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;one of the finest ever seen&quot;. Commenting on Miller&#x27; innings, Robertson-Glasgow said &quot;From the moment he takes guard he plays each ball just that much below its supposed merits that scratches a bowler&#x27;s pride&quot;. Miller had enjoyed his visit to the home of cricket. In eight innings at Lord&#x27;s for the season, he had scored 568 runs at 94.68, with three centuries.

The season ended with a few more matches against English counties. Miller struck aggressive half-centuries in wins against Nottinghamshire and Leveson-Gower&#x27;s XI. In first-class matches, Miller had scored 725 runs at 72.50 for the season, finishing second in both averages and aggregates. The success of the Australian Services prompted a fundraising tour of India and Ceylon on their return to Australia.

===Services tour of India===
Miller, the vice-captain, almost missed the trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. On arrival in India, Miller scored 46 in a draw against North Zone. Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay, top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In a match against India, Miller took two wickets. At this point, with most of the team suffering from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to travel by air, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy, Miller being one of the candidates to replace him. This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team.

The team played East Zone in Calcutta as the city was in the grip of deadly pro-independence riots. Miller&#x27;s friend, Denis Compton, was batting for East Zone when rioters invaded the pitch. Their leader ran up to Compton and said: &quot;Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop&quot;. In later years, whenever Miller opposed Compton, he would quote this remark when Compton came to the crease. In 2005, the ECB and Cricket Australia decided that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the Compton–Miller Medal, recognising their friendship and rivalry.

In the second match against India, Services were 2/250 in response to India&#x27;s 386 when Miller came in and scored 82, including four sixes in five balls. The match ended in a draw and Miller aggravating an injury. Miller took 3/19 against South Zone in Madras, the Australians&#x27; only win in India. He failed with the bat in the third and final match against India, scoring two and seven, but he took 2/60 in the first innings as India took the series 1–0. Overall, Miller had a disappointing series in the international matches, with 107 runs at 26.25 and four wickets at 40.50. Australia&#x27;s final match was in Colombo against an All Ceylon team. Miller scored 132 as Australia won by an innings.

===Services in Australia===

Upon returning to Australia, Hassett&#x27;s men were assigned to play a further six first-class matches against the state teams. The fixtures were meant to revive cricket and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946. Miller started his campaign with 80 against Western Australia. He finally returned to Melbourne in January, before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 in an innings defeat.

Miller had another difficult time against New South Wales, as the state side made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless. When the servicemen batted, they faced an attack featuring leading leg spinner Bill O&#x27;Reilly and paceman Ray Lindwall, the fastest in Australia. Miller was on 74 as Services limped to 9/171. With only one partner left, Miller attacked, scoring 31 of the last 33 runs to end unbeaten on 105, and earning plaudits among cricket pundits on Australian soil. Former leading Test batsman Alan Kippax opined that &quot;Australia has unearthed a new champion&quot;, and O&#x27;Reilly said that Miller&#x27;s century was &quot;one of the best hundreds ever got against me&quot;. Miller compiled 46 in the second innings as the Servicemen fell to another innings defeat. Miller finished the season with 4/49 against Queensland and a pair of fifties against Tasmania.

==Test career==

===Test debut===

At the end of the season, Miller was selected for the New Zealand tour, under the captaincy of Queensland&#x27;s Bill Brown. Miller started the tour well, top-scoring with 139 against Auckland. Along with seven other debutants, Miller made his test debut in the match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, a match that was retrospectively accorded Test status in 1948. On a sticky wicket, New Zealand won the toss and batted. Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings as O&#x27;Reilly and Ernie Toshack skittled the home side for just 42. Australia made 8/199 with Miller scoring 30. He was allowed to take the new ball in the second innings, taking 2/6 in six overs before a flare-up of his back injury forced him to be removed from the attack. Australia bowled their hosts out for 54, securing an innings victory.

Despite the scare over his back complaint, Miller returned from New Zealand to play in the 1946 season, which turned out to be his last season in the VFL; St Kilda finished second-last. Miller played with more aggression than during his pre-war years and his high leaping marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia. Miller thus became one of the few players to play at the highest levels of both cricket and Australian rules football.
Miller was discharged from the RAAF on 26 June 1946, and returned to his job at Vacuum Oil. Miller resented the fact that many of his colleagues had avoided the hazards of war and moved steadily up the ladder and regarded his job as demeaning. Under such circumstances, Miller contemplated quitting Australian cricket and accepting a professional contract with Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League, valued at £1,000 per year, for three seasons. With advertising and commercial commitments likely to triple this figure, playing in England would have been approximately ten times more lucrative than continuing in Australia. Miller was worried that his impulsive style would be curtailed by the pressures of professionalism. At that time, the Board of Control&#x27;s policy stipulated that any player that signed with a professional league in England could not represent Australia. Miller&#x27;s contract would see him in England until he was 30, effectively ending his career for Australia. Furthermore, it would have prevented him from playing Australian football during the winter. Miller weighed it up and opted to sign the contract that tied him to Rawtenstall, his duties to start with the onset of the English season in April 1947.

In the meantime, Miller had the upcoming Test series against England in 1946–47 to look forward to. He therefore approached his employers for two months leave so that he could travel to the United States to marry Wagner, which would allow him time to return in preparation for the international series. Vacuum Oil refused, so, with the comfort of job security in England, Miller resigned.

Miller left Australia at the end of the football season in late August, amid press speculation that he might not return. He was reunited in Boston with Wagner after more than three years of separation and they married on 21 September 1946. Miller and his new bride returned to Australia in November. In the meantime, his contract with Rawtenstall became public knowledge and he was threatened with his Test career being terminated if he began playing for the English team.

===First Ashes series===

Miller&#x27;s season started amid ongoing speculation about whether he would fulfil his contract with Rawtenstall. Miller remained silent. In a Shield match in front of Bradman at the Adelaide Oval, Miller struck form with 188 and 2/32 with the ball. &quot;Wisden&quot; said Miller&#x27;s innings was &quot;one of the finest batting displays ever seen at Adelaide&quot;. Bradman saw Miller as a top-order batsman and as the new ball partner for Lindwall. Although Miller was a reluctant bowler, Bradman felt that he was crucial to his strategy of attacking England&#x27;s strong batting line-up with express pace. 

Miller made his Ashes debut in the first Test in Brisbane. Bradman opted for six front-line bowlers, with Miller as high as number five in the batting order. Australia batted first, Miller coming in at 3/322. He played aggressively to reach his fifty in just 80 minutes, striking a six onto the roof of the members&#x27; stand at long on, the biggest hit at the ground at the time, before being trapped leg before wicket by Doug Wright for 79 as Australia made 645. Miller was given the new ball along with Lindwall and he took his first Ashes wicket, bowling Hutton as England closed at 1/21. The following day, the pitch had turned into a sticky wicket following a heavy tropical storm. Miller bowled off breaks at medium pace and mixed in a large amount of bouncers. On the unpredictable surface, Edrich was struck around 40 times on the body. Miller cut through the English top order, removing Edrich, Washbrook, Compton and Jack Ikin on the fourth morning, finishing with 7/60 as England made 141 and were forced to follow on. Miller took two wickets, including the dismissal of Hutton with first ball of the second innings as England fell to defeat by an innings and 334 runs and Miller had match figures of 9/77.

During that first Test, an incident occurred, coloured by Miller&#x27;s wartime service, that soured his relationship with Bradman and his feelings towards Test cricket. Michael Parkinson described it as follows:
Keith Miller was deeply affected by the Second World War. It changed him ... In the first post-war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... [and] Bill Edrich came in. He&#x27;d had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, &quot;He&#x27;s my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years&#x27; war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman came up to me and said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.&#x27; That remark put me off Test cricket. Never felt the same way about it after that.&quot;

In the Second Test in Sydney. Miller had a quiet match, scoring 40 and taking one wicket on a spin-friendly pitch as Australia secured another innings victory, but showed he was in prime batting form when he returned to the Sheffield Shield. Playing against New South Wales, he hammered three sixes in one over and made 153 of a 271-run partnership with Merv Harvey in just over three hours, setting up an innings victory. Bill Ponsford said that it was the hardest hitting he had ever seen. The Third Test was Miller&#x27;s first in his home town. He had a mediocre game in a drawn match, scoring 33 and 34, and taking two wickets.

Off the pitch, Miller privately decided that he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract. He secretly accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket. Back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day. He hit the first ball of the next day for six, and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men on the fence. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw. Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.

The Fifth Test. saw Miller take a wicket in each innings. Australia were left a target of 214 runs on a wearing wicket. Wright beat Miller with three consecutive leg breaks, but Miller survived and struck consecutive boundaries on the way to reaching the target. Australia had taken the series 3–0; Miller scored 384 runs at 76.80 and took 16 wickets at 20.88, which placed him second in both the batting and bowling averages, to Bradman and Lindwall respectively. Nevertheless, Miller had become disillusioned with Bradman&#x27;s ruthless mentality. Miller was impulsive and cared little for records or ruthlessly dominating his opponents, preferring to play in a flamboyant manner in close contests.

For the 1947–48 Australian season, Miller transferred to New South Wales (NSW), for whom he played the remainder of his Sheffield Shield career. He also represented the New South Wales interstate football team at the 1947 Hobart Carnival, as vice captain. This made him one of the few players to play both football and cricket for two states.

Miller had a light workload in the 1947–48 home Test series against India, who were on their first tour to Australia. India were well beaten, losing 4–0, three of the four defeats by an innings. Miller was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185 runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries, while the batsmen ahead of him plundered the bowling. His bowling duties were also light; his 72 overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. In both his fifties, Miller featured in century partnerships with his partners, respectively Bradman and Hassett in the First and Fourth test respectively. His 58 in the First Test at Brisbane featured many big hits.

===&quot;Invincibles&quot; tour===

Donald Bradman&#x27;s 1948 touring party to England has become known to cricket history as &quot;The Invincibles&quot;, remaining undefeated in its 31 matches. Miller started the tour strongly, scoring a hard-hitting 50 not out against Worcestershire, and an unbeaten 202 against Leicestershire. In the next match against Yorkshire, Miller took 6/42, including the prized wicket of Hutton, as the home team were demolished for just 71. Australia then struggled to 101, including a counterattacking 34 from Miller, who took 3/49 in the second innings in an Australian victory.

In a later match, against Essex, Miller was involved in a famous incident that is frequently cited when his character is discussed; it also spotlighted his differences with Bradman. On a day when the Australians set a world-record of 721 runs in a single day, Miller came to the crease with his side already dominating, with the score 2/364. He deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball, much to Bradman&#x27;s displeasure, in a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest.

Australia then took on the MCC at Lord&#x27;s; effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests as many of England&#x27;s Test players were in the MCC team. Miller scored 163 in 250 minutes, hitting 20 fours and three sixes in another innings win. Soon after, Rawtenstall dropped the contract dispute with Miller after being offered compensation.

Following another good all-round performance against Hampshire, top-scoring in the first innings and taking 5/25 in the second, Miller went into the First Test (at Trent Bridge) in fine form. On the first morning, Miller bowled Hutton and Compton on his way to 3/38, helping Australia dismiss England cheaply and seize the initiative. Miller scored a duck, but Australia took a 344-run lead on the first innings. In the second innings, he resumed his battle with Hutton and Compton, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. The next day, he bowled Hutton for 74 and then bounced Compton, causing him to fall onto his stumps for 184. Australia won by eight wickets, Miller ending with 4/125 for the second innings and 7/163 for the match.

Miller was unfit to bowl during the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s. During England&#x27;s first innings, Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that he would reverse his decision not to bowl. Miller refused and returned the ball, citing his back. Miller&#x27;s action generated news headlines, journalists believing that he had disobeyed Bradman. His batting ability, however, was such that he played as a specialist batsman even when he was unable to bowl due to injury, such as during the Second Test. Miller wanted to play purely as a batsman, feeling that the workload of bowling would hinder his run-scoring. However, Bradman was intent on going through the tour undefeated, and utilised his bowling options to the full, to maximise the Australians’ chances of winning. Lindwall and Miller were the first-choice pace duo, regarded as one of the greatest speed pairings in the history of cricket, whereas the latter was just one of many accomplished batsmen in the team. As a result, the Australian skipper valued Miller more as an opening bowler. He ended the Tests with 184 runs at 26.28 and 13 wickets at 23.15 from 138.1 overs and took eight catches.

As a batsman, Miller was out for four in the first innings, not offering a shot to an inswinger. In the second innings, Miller&#x27;s first ball was a hat-trick ball from English captain Norman Yardley; he survived a loud leg before wicket appeal and then hit a six into the grandstand, on his way to 74. Australia declared at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409 runs.

After the Lord&#x27;s Test, Miller enjoyed a night out and returned to the team hotel after daybreak the next morning. Australia were due to play Surrey at The Oval that day. With Australia in the field, Bradman sent Miller to the fine leg boundary as a punishment—between overs, he was forced to walk the length of the field. One of the spectators felt sorry for Miller and lent him his bicycle, which Miller used to cycle around the circumference of the ground.

The efforts of Miller and Lindwall against Hutton had led the English selectors to drop the Yorkshireman for the Third Test. The Australians were surprised by the move and thought that it was a bad move by their opponents. Miller had a quiet Third Test at Old Trafford, taking one wicket and scoring 31 as the match ended in a draw. In a rain-shortened match, Miller again earned the ire of the crowd, after aiming a series of bouncers at Edrich, in apparent retaliation to the Englishman&#x27;s bouncing of Lindwall. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman ordered him to stop.

When fit, Miller opened the Test bowling with Lindwall, and the pair bowled in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. The English cricket authorities had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs. The pre-existing rule stipulated that a replacement ball would be available every 200 runs, which usually took much more time to accumulate. This played directly into the hands of the Australians with their vastly stronger pace attack, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice bowlers for a fresh attack every 55 overs. With 13 wickets in the Tests, Miller was third among the Australians behind Lindwall and Johnston, who took 27 apiece. Owing to his fragility, Miller was used sparingly compared to the other four Australian frontline bowlers: Toshack and Johnson each delivered more than 170 overs despite playing in one less Test, while Lindwall bowled 224 and Johnston 306 in five matches. In all first-class matches, Miller took 56 wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no intervening rest day, so Bradman ensured that his leading pace duo remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a smaller proportion of the bowling during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4 and Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Doug Ring—who was only selected in one Test—bowled 542.4 overs, while all rounders Colin McCool and Loxton bowled 399.4 and 361.2 overs respectively. McCool did not play in any Tests, while Loxton was only entrusted with 63 overs against England. As such, in some tour matches, Miller was not asked to bowl at all, in order to keep him fresh for the Tests.

The teams moved to Headingley for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Hutton had been recalled and the home team batted first. England tallied 496 and Miller took 1/43. In reply, Australia were struggling at 3/68 in reply on the third morning. Neil Harvey, playing his first Ashes Test, joined Miller at the crease. The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted Jim Laker&#x27;s first ball over square leg for six. Miller struck consecutive sixes over long off and the sightscreen respectively. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative; Harvey joined in and hit consecutive boundaries against Laker. Miller then lifted another six over long off, and another over long on from Norman Yardley. He was dismissed for 58 attempting another six. The partnership had yielded 121 runs in only 90 minutes, and was described by Wisden as a &quot;hurricane&quot;. John Arlott described the innings as the most memorable that he had witnessed. He said &quot;Miller played like an emperor ... Every stroke would have been memorable but each one had bettered its predecessor&quot;. Jack Fingleton said that he had never &quot;known a more enjoyable hour&quot; of &quot;delectable cricket&quot;. The momentum swung and Australia finished at 457 on the fourth day, having added almost 396 in one day&#x27;s play. Miller took 1/53 in the second innings as Australia were set a world record chase of 404 on the final day. He made only 12 but Australia broke the world record to take a 3–0 lead.

The Australians moved onto the next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored a half-century and took 3/31 in an innings victory. Against Glamorgan, Miller took two wickets before striking a hard-hitting 84 with five sixes. He struck one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. In a match against Lancashire, Jack Ikin had reached 99 despite being repeatedly hit. Miller refused to bowl to Ikin, saying that he felt the batsman deserved a century. Lindwall was given the ball and promptly removed Ikin for 99.

The teams proceeded to The Oval for the Fifth Test. After England elected to bat, Miller bowled John Dewes with his second ball and then removed Jack Crapp without scoring, leaving England at 4/23. Miller ended with 2/5 as Lindwall (6/20) cut down the home team for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five. Australia led by 337 on the first innings and Miller dismissed Hutton and Crapp to end with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win. Miller ended the Tests with 184 runs at 26.28 and 13 wickets at 23.15. He took eight catches.

In a match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord&#x27;s, Miller scored 69 and was dismissed attempting a third consecutive hooked boundary. Australia went through the remaining tour matches unbeaten to end the summer without a defeat.

After the tour, Bradman was full of praise for Miller, though somewhat critical of his aggressive batting: Miller totalled 1,088 runs for the tour at an average of 47.30, only the eighth highest in the squad. He took 56 wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches.

Bradman criticised Miller&#x27;s hitting of sixes (26), feeling that his mercurial all rounder lacked restraint and concentration. In contrast, Fingleton praised Miller&#x27;s attitude to cricket, saying &quot;He is never one to accept runs when they are there for the taking ... I acknowledge myself the supreme believer in Miller as a cricketer. He had given me joy in the game approached by others.&quot; With respect to his persistent bouncing of Hutton and Compton, Fingleton said that it was up to England to develop bowlers of express pace—which they lacked at the time—to retaliate against or deter the Australians from pursuing such tactics. Miller&#x27;s persistent disagreements with Bradman soon caught up with him, despite the latter&#x27;s retirement after the tour. During Bradman&#x27;s testimonial match, Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at his retired captain, dismissing him with the last of these and drawing an angry look. Bradman was one of three members of the national selection panel, and Miller was dropped for the next series against South Africa in 1949–50. Although Bradman denied voting for the omission, most of the players in the team did not believe this.

===Omission for South Africa===
After returning to Australia, Miller played against Bradman in a testimonial match in 1948–49. Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at Bradman, dismissing him with the last of the short-pitched deliveries for 53. Bradman was angered by Miller&#x27;s bowling. One week later, the squad to tour South Africa in the following season was announced, and Miller was omitted, despite being ranked as the best all rounder in the world. During the Australian season, which was a purely domestic one, he had scored 400 runs at 33.33 and taken 11 wickets at 24.09. He scored one century against Queensland during the season, as well as a 99 against Victoria at the SCG. The surprise omission led to much conjecturing about the reasoning. One was that Miller had stated during the season that he did not want to bowl, so the selectors only considered his batting performances. Another was that Miller&#x27;s bouncing of Bradman had provoked his former captain into voting against him at the selection table. Rumours circulated that new captain Lindsay Hassett did not want Miller on the tour because he was undisciplined, which Hassett denied. Another was that Jack Ryder, the Victorian selector and former Australian captain, had voted against Miller in retaliation for his move to New South Wales. Both Bradman and Chappie Dwyer claimed they voted for Miller, leading Miller to quip &quot;somebody&#x27;s telling lies&quot;, as there were only three on the selection panel.

The media stridently criticised Miller&#x27;s omission, as did former players such as Stan McCabe and Alan Kippax. During the off season, he worked as a journalist and played baseball, but declined a trial with a Major League Baseball club, the Boston Red Sox. Miller captained New South Wales at the start of the 1949–50 season as his colleagues went to South Africa, his first leadership experience in the Sheffield Shield. He scored 80 and took six wickets in the first match against Queensland. After another victory over Western Australia, he received a request from the Australian Board of Control. At the request of captain Hassett, Miller was asked to tour South Africa as cover for Johnston, who had been injured in a car crash. Miller accepted the offer and resigned himself to bowling heavily. Miller almost missed the trip after arriving late at the dock in Perth after a drunken night. The next boat to South Africa would not have departed for several weeks. Despite his recall, there remained tension over his initial omission, as Dwyer was the team manager.

Miller was given the responsibility of batting in the number three position when Hassett was afflicted by tonsillitis. In the First Test at Johannesburg, Miller scored 21 and then took 5/40 in South Africa&#x27;s first innings, only his second match on tour, resulting in the home side being forced to follow on and lose by an innings. In the Second Test at Cape Town, he scored 58 and then took 3/54 in the first innings. On the third morning, Miller crashed his car and arrived late to the ground, still putting on his trousers as he entered the playing field. Despite, this he dismissed Dudley Nourse with his third ball. He was wicketless in the second innings, and took only one in the Third Test in Durban and did not pass 10 with the bat. Australia won both matches. He returned to the form in the Fourth Test with 84, 33 not out and 3/75 in a high scoring draw. Miller took match figures of 5/66 in the Fifth Test as Australia took the series 4–0. He ended the series with 246 runs at 41.00 and 17 wickets at 22.94, placing in the top six in the Test averages for bat and ball. During the tour matches, he took match figures of 11/54 against Natal Country Districts and scored a century against Transvaal.

===Ashes in Australia===

Miller started the 1950–51 season with an unbeaten 201 in a Shield match against Queensland. At 438 minutes, it was his longest first-class innings. In the return match, he scored 138 not out in just 118 minutes in a successful run-chase, a sharp contrast to his double-century. In a tour match against the visiting England team at the SCG before the Test series, Miller scored 214, having been 99 not out at stumps on the previous day. He hit 15 fours and three sixes. He made ducks in consecutive matches leading into the First Test in Brisbane. Miller scored 15 and eight on a rain-affected pitch, and took match figures of 3/50 in an Australian victory, dismissing Dewes twice. He had another quiet match in the Second Test, scoring 18 and 14 and taking a match total of 2/55. After struggling in the first two Tests, Miller rediscovered his batting form with 98 against the tourists for New South Wales.

England had started the Third Test at Sydney strongly. Australia took its first wicket when Miller caught Washbrook from Johnson with a horizontal diving catch at slip. England were still in control at 1/128 when Miller came on to bowl. He removed Hutton and Reg Simpson before bowling Compton for a duck. In the space of four overs from Miller, England were now 4/137. Miller had contributed to all four wickets. Miller ended with 4/37 as England were bowled out for 290 on the second day. Miller batted patiently on the third day, reaching 96 by stumps with Australia at 6/362. The next day, with his century four runs away, Miller arrived late, leaving his batting partner Johnson waiting at the players&#x27; gate. Miller progressed to 145 not out despite the interruption. It has been a patient innings by his standards, taking almost a day. England collapsed for 123, leaving Australia to take an innings victory. In the first innings of the Fourth Test in Sydney, Miller scored 44 and did not take a wicket, but he was heading for consecutive Test centuries in the second innings. He reached 99 when a leg break from Doug Wright spun across him and clipped the off bail. The innings helped Australia to set England a target of 503. Miller took 3/27 on the final day, helping to cut through the middle order as Australia won by 274 runs. Miller was out for seven and a duck in the Fifth Test at the MCG. He took 4/76 in the first innings, joining Lindwall in cutting down the middle order, despite which England won by eight wickets. Miller topped the Test batting averages with 350 runs at 43.75, and for the entire first-class season, he scored 1332 runs at 78.35, the highest among all comers. His bowling was also strong, with 17 wickets at 17.70, second only to Jack Iverson (21 wickets at 15.23). An attack by Morris (182) and Miller (83) in a Shield match dispirited Iverson, and he never played Test cricket again.

===West Indies tour Australia===
The 1951–52 Australian season saw the first tour by a West Indian team in two decades. The Caribbean team had beaten England 3–1 in 1950 and were regarded as the biggest threat to Australia since &quot;Bodyline&quot;. The batting was led by the &quot;three Ws&quot;: Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott. The English had also been bamboozled by the leg spin and left arm orthodox of Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine, who took 59 wickets between them in four Tests against England. Miller and Lindwall were charged with attacking the opposition batsmen, testing them with short-pitched bowling. The West Indies batted first in the First Test at Brisbane and were dismissed for 216; Miller dismissing their captain John Goddard. Miller came to the crease at 3/80 and could not pick Ramadhin. He decided to attack the leg spinner without picking him. He missed some, was dropped twice and hit a six before falling for 46 to Valentine. Australia scraped out a 10-run lead. Miller took another wicket in the second innings but managed only four as Australia stumbled to a three-wicket victory. Between Tests, Miller took eight wickets in the match as New South Wales beat the tourists in a tour match. In the Second Test at Sydney, Miller came to the crease at 3/106 having gone wicketless in the West Indies&#x27; first innings of 362. He began to pick Ramadhin and finished with 129 in 246 minutes. Miller and Hassett put on 235, an Australian Test record for any wicket against the West Indies. Ramadhin ended with 1/196 and was demoralised. In the second innings, Miller took 3/50 with a heavy barrage of short balls and claimed two catches to help Australia to a seven-wicket victory. &quot;Wisden&quot; decried Lindwall and Miller&#x27;s &quot;relentless bumper tactics&quot;.

Miller had a lean Third Test, taking only one wicket and scoring four and 35, as Australia lost by six wickets. In the Fourth Test at the MCG, the West Indies batted first and Miller removed both openers in the first hour, before returning to end with 5/60 as the tourists were bowled out for 272. He then scored 47 as Australia managed only 216. He took 2/49, but only scored two in Australia&#x27;s run-chase of 259. The home team won by one wicket. In the Fifth Test, Miller took 5/26 in the first innings with another concentrated display of short-pitched bowling, and then scored 69 in the second innings. He took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia fell short of their target. Miller ended the series as the leading bowler, with 20 wickets at 19.90. He was second in the batting, with 362 runs at 40.22. Throughout the series, Miller and Lindwall were repeatedly successful with their concerted bouncer tactics, which were heavily criticised.

After the Test series ended, Miller captained a Commonwealth XI that played against a touring England team in Colombo, Ceylon. England had been on a tour of the Indian subcontinent. Miller scored 106 as the Commonwealth compiled 517. Miller took three wickets in the first innings and led his team to a victory by an innings and 259 runs.

===Captain of New South Wales===
At the start of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association&#x27;s five-man selection panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.

In his first match as leader, Miller scored 109 against Queensland. Taking 260 minutes, it was the slowest century of his career. In another match against the touring South Africans, Miller elected to field and reduced his opponents to 3/3 and went on to win by five wickets. His players respected him, and some began to mimic his cough, voice, gait and idiosyncrasies. Richie Benaud unbuttoned his shirt in Miller&#x27;s mould. He captained in an unorthodox manner, often trying unusual ploys to unsettle the opposition. He encouraged the opposition to attack in an attempt to get a wicket, and often shuffled his batting order to suit the circumstances of his batsmen. He was soon called before authorities after a match against South Australia. Sid Barnes, his 12th man, had come onto the ground with drinks, dressed as a flight attendant. He also brought things such as cigars, mirrors and combs. Barnes&#x27; antics extended the break longer than usual. Miller was called before the NSWCA after the South Australian Cricket Association lodged a complaint, and had to give an assurance that such an incident would not be repeated.

Miller started the Test series against South Africa poorly. Suffering from a throat infection, he scored three in both innings and took 1/46 in an Australian victory. In the Second Test at the MCG, Miller performed consistently with bat and ball, taking 4/62 and 3/51 and scoring 52 and 31. In the course of the match, he passed the all-round double of 1000 Test runs and 100 Test wickets when he dismissed John Waite in the second innings, but this was not enough to prevent defeat. In the Third Test, Miller scored 55, putting on 168 with Harvey, and took 3/48 and 2/33 in an innings victory. Australia&#x27;s fortunes took a turn for the worse in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Miller scored nine and injured his back after two overs with the ball. Lindwall also broke down. Without their spearheads, Australia were unable to bowl out the South Africans and match was drawn. Both were ruled out of the Fifth Test and the South Africans levelled the series despite conceding 520 runs during the first innings. Australia&#x27;s bowlers were unable to stop the South African batsmen without their new ball pair.

===1953 Ashes tour===
Australia proceeded to the 1953 Ashes tour. During a stopover at Naples, Miller was locked inside after entering a private opera rehearsal without authorisation, but managed to escape and rejoin the boat as it was about to leave. During his career, several cricket books were published under Miller&#x27;s name, and he was embroiled in further controversy when one ghost-written tome, which was printed as the team left for England, criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious.

The burden on Miller and Lindwall increased when Johnston broke down in an early tour game. Miller was wicketless against Worcestershire, but succeeded with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 220 in just over six hours. He then scored 159 not out against Yorkshire. At this point, Miller had scored 421 runs in the week of May, and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000 runs in one month, something that had been done on a tour only by Bradman.

Miller&#x27;s love of horseracing then interfered with his quest. Wanting to attend an afternoon race meeting, he opened the batting in the morning against Cambridge University. Not intending to play a long innings, he attacked the bowling and was out for 20, before heading for the track. He stayed at the track until late afternoon, and returned to find the Australians walking out to field. This was followed by a match against the MCC at Lord&#x27;s where he took four wickets of English Test players. Miller then took match figures of 5/27 against Oxford University. In the match against Essex, Miller pulled rib muscles, meaning he could not bowl in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He scored 55 and five in a rain-affected draw.

Australia travelled to Bramall Lane under the captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested and stayed in London with the team manager. After the first day&#x27;s play, he organised a party for that lasted until the next afternoon—the rest day. He woke up with a hangover the next day just minutes before the start of play. Improvising, Miller arrived at the ground in a hearse. When it was Australia&#x27;s turn to bat, Miller was the last man to be dismissed, having scored 86 despite his hangover.

The Test series moved to Lord&#x27;s. Miller resumed bowling, sending down 42 overs and taking a total of 1/74. He managed 25 in the first innings, but promoted to number three in the second innings, he batted patiently to reach stumps before reaching his first Test century on English soil the following morning, but England held on for a draw. More than half of the Third Test at Old Trafford was washed out, resulting in another draw. Miller took 1/38 bowling fast off breaks and scored 17 and six. Australia then played Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s, where Miller scored a hard-hitting 71.

Australia elected to field on a wet wicket in the Fourth Test at Headingley. Miller dismissed Edrich and Graveney and ended with 2/39 from 38 overs as England were bowled out for 167. Miller made only five in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall launched a short-pitched barrage and dismissed Watson and Simpson in consecutive balls. England were 5/177 a stumps on day four, leading by 78. The pacemen were booed from the field. The next day, Miller dismissed Evans early, before Trevor Bailey began his resistance. Frustrated by Bailey&#x27;s defensive style and time-wasting, Miller lost his cool and aimed a beamer straight at Bailey&#x27;s head, further angering the crowd. Miller ended with 4/63 from a long spell of 47 overs. England held on for another draw after more time-wasting by Bailey. The teams headed for the Fifth Test at The Oval tied 0–0. Miller&#x27;s last Test performance was his least productive; he scored one and a duck and took a total of 2/89. England won the match and regained the Ashes. Miller&#x27;s returns were below his career standards, with 223 runs at 24.77 and 10 wickets at 30.30. He took two catches.

Miller scored 67 against the Gentlemen of England at Lord&#x27;s and then played against the Combined Services at Kingston. He reached his century before lunch and then proceeded to 262 not out with 24 boundaries. This included a 377-run fourth-wicket stand by Jim de Courcy in only 205 minutes, in particular targeting Fred Trueman&#x27;s bowling. He then took 3/17 with the ball. He finished the English summer with 1,433 runs at 51.17, the second highest average behind Harvey among batsmen with over 200 runs. He was the only Australian to hit two double centuries and also took 45 wickets at 22.51. For his efforts that summer, &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; named him one of its Five Cricketers of the Year.

===Overlooked for Test captaincy===
Miller returned to Australia and led New South Wales to the Sheffield Shield title in 1953–54. He topped the Australian first-class batting averages with 71.10, but had his poorest season with the ball, taking only 16 wickets at 38.75. The season was purely domestic with no touring side and therefore no Test matches. The season was also a transition point in Australian cricket, as Hassett retired upon return to Australia. Initially, Morris and Miller were the two frontrunners for the captaincy. Miller was the state captain, but Morris was the vice-captain of the Test team ahead of Miller. At the time, Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team, but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett, who accused him of not trying. Hassett told Johnson that he could become Test captain if he regained his form and his Test position. As the outgoing captain, Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor. Miller had also criticised Hassett in his book, and there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller&#x27;s departure from South Melbourne and Victoria. Johnson returned to form with 45 wickets at 22.75 for the season.

England toured Australia in the 1954–55 season. Johnson was selected to lead an Australian XI in a tour match against the Englishmen before the Tests, an indication of the selectors&#x27; inclination. He took 6/66 in England&#x27;s only innings. The build-up featured a media war, Melbourne newspapers stumping for Johnson and the Sydney journalists trumpeting Miller. Miller warmed up for the Tests with 86 for New South Wales against England. On 18 November, the Australian Board of Control selected Johnson as captain, with Morris as his deputy. Miller&#x27;s irreverent nature was cited as a possible reason for the board&#x27;s selection. Johnson was regarded as a superior diplomat; Miller had a reputation for turning up late and being undisciplined. Miller had frequently been in dispute with Bradman, who was a member of the board and the chairman of selectors. Miller had also questioned where revenue that the board collected from ticket sales was being used. Others claimed that Johnson was appointed because he was part of the establishment; his father Bill was a former Australian selector. The decision was bitterly criticised by the Sydney press.
Miller scored 49 in the First Test at Brisbane as Australia amassed 8/601, before dismissing Simpson and Hutton as England fell to an innings defeat. A knee injury forced Miller to miss the Second Test at the SCG, which England won. Miller returned for the Third Test at the MCG, but was initially unavailable to bowl due to lingering knee problems. Upon receiving an inquiry about the health of his knee before the match by Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies, Miller agreed to try to bowl for a short period and lift his team. England elected to bat and Miller removed Hutton, Edrich and Compton with his outswinger. He ended up bowling for the entire first session of play and had 3/5 at lunch from nine overs, before finishing at 3/14. England were bowled out for 191. Miller struggled with the bat, scoring six and seven as Frank Tyson&#x27;s pace saw England inflict a second successive defeat on Australia. Australia needed to win the Fourth Test in Adelaide to keep the series alive. Miller scored 44 and 14 as Australia were bowled out in the second innings to leave England with 94 for victory. Miller made a late burst, removing Edrich, Hutton and Colin Cowdrey in consecutive overs to leave England at 3/18. He then took a difficult catch from Johnston to dismiss Peter May. England were then 4/49 but hung on to win by five wickets and secure the Ashes. It was the first time that Australia had lost three consecutive Tests since the &quot;Bodyline&quot; series of 1932–33. Miller made 19 and 28 in the rain-affected draw in the Fifth Test. He ended the series with 167 runs at 23.86, his lowest ever at international level, and took 10 wickets at 24.30.

He had more success as domestic level. New South Wales beat Victoria in two days at the SCG to win the Sheffield Shield; Miller taking five wickets in the second innings. He also led his state in a 45-run win over the tourists, their only defeat apart from the First Test. The match was marked by a quickfire 71 in 57 minutes and his team&#x27;s attacking strategy.

===West Indies tour===

After leading his state to another Sheffield Shield title and a win over England, Miller replaced Morris as the vice-captain for the tour of the West Indies that started in early 1955. Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years, having lost two consecutive series to England. Australia batted first in the opening Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica. Miller came to the wicket at 2/137 and put on a 224-run partnership with Harvey. Both ended with centuries and Miller scored his highest Test score of 147, striking 15 fours. When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100 runs, he respectively shook their hands. Australia finished at 9/515. Johnson had been injured when hit in the foot by a yorker so Miller was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short. Miller attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities. He took the new ball at 5/239 and the hosts collapsed to be all out for 259. Miller had taken 2/36, and enforced the follow-on, which was questioned as paceman Ron Archer had broken down. With Australia two bowlers short, the West Indies moved to 1/114. When Weekes arrived at the crease, Miller unsettled him with delaying tactics, and he was out for one. He then placed two silly points and two silly mid-ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott, who fell to Lindwall soon after. Miller then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs. The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets. Miller had taken 3/62 in the second innings.

Johnson resumed the leadership on the field in the Second Test at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval in Trinidad. The match was a high-scoring draw, but Miller scored only three and took match figures of 1/148. In the Third Test at Georgetown, Guyana, Miller removed both openers in the first innings and then scored 33 as Australia by eight wickets. He took 3/51 for the match. In the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, Miller came to the wicket with Australia at 3/226 on the first day. The tourists lost two more wickets to be 5/233. Miller and Archer launched a counter-attacking partnership of 206. Miller reached 137 and then walked after edging a ball, even though none of the opposition had appealed. Australia reached 668 and the West Indies were struggling at 6/147, Miller having dismissed Weekes and Collie Smith in the same over. At the time, Miller was bowling at medium pace, but Johnson felt that the new batsmen Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza were vulnerable to express pace. Johnson ordered Miller to bowl fast, but was turned down. Johnson replaced Miller with Lindwall, who was tired and was hit around the ground. The pair seized the initiative and compiled a world Test record of 347 for the seventh wicket and the Australians were tired after failing to break the partnership. Miller attacked Johnson in front of the other players, saying &quot;You couldn&#x27;t captain a bunch of bloody schoolboys!&quot; Johnson then offered to resolve the dispute &quot;out the back&quot;, implying a fisticuffs.

Miller declined the offer and stopped. The match resumed the next day and the West Indies were eventually bowled out 158 behind. Miller had been punished by the batsmen, taking 2/113 from 22 overs. Miller scored 10 and took 1/66 in the second innings as the match ended in a high-scoring draw. Miller then took 6/107 in the first innings of the Fifth Test in Jamaica. He removed John Holt, Walcott and Smith, before taking three tail-end wickets as the home team were bowled out for 357. When Australia batted, Miller arrived at the crease to join Harvey with the score at 3/302. He added his third century of the series and ended with 109 as Australia reached 8/758. He took 2/58 in the second innings as Australia completed a 3–0 win. It was Miller&#x27;s most statistically successful series, with 439 runs at 73.17 and the 20 wickets at 32.05 made him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall.

===Final domestic season===
Miller started the 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic, with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane. On the final day, Miller set the hosts 275 for victory in three hours. He convinced officials to pause the match for the running of the Melbourne Cup. Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller&#x27;s love of horseracing.

The next match was against South Australia in Sydney. New South Wales had declared at 8/215 and the visitors were 0/2 at stumps on the first day. Miller&#x27;s wife gave birth to their fourth child, and Miller was drinking into the next morning. He then arrived at the SCG, having forgotten to pick up teammate Peter Philpott as arranged, so he had to rush back and the pair arrived late for the day&#x27;s play. Miller was still in a tuxedo as play was about to start. Miller completed the unfinished over from the previous night and felt that the pitch did not offer any assistance. He then told Alan Davidson to bowl the next over from his end but, as Davidson was about to bowl, Miller changed his mind and took over. Miller bowled Les Favell in the over. He kept on bowling and finished with 7/12 from 7.3 overs, clean bowling five of his victims. The visitors had been levelled for 27, the lowest score in the history of the Sheffield Shield. Miller then asked South Australia to follow-on, but showed little interest in bowling again, delivering only six overs despite the bowler-friendly conditions. Philpott said that &quot;this was typical Miller. He was never an accumulator of records, not particularly concerned with figures.&quot; In another incident, Miller had been making a speech at a civic reception for the New South Wales team in the town of Maitland. In front of the mayor at the town hall, he praised the hospitality, before turning around to his players and asking what the name of the town was. Miller then turned up late to a coaching clinic the next day and instead of teaching, he made a speech, advising the children to play tennis as there was more money on offer.

In January 1956, Miller injured his back in a match against Queensland. He suffered spasms that forced him to miss the rest of the season. He had scored 403 runs at 80.60 and taken 19 wickets at 14.94. New South Wales again won the Sheffield Shield.

===Final Ashes tour===

Miller was selected for the 1956 Ashes tour, but could not bowl for a month because of a back injury from the first match. Miller captained the Australians against Leicester. Coming in at 3/175, Miller made his highest first-class score of 281 not out, striking 35 fours in six and a half hours. A tougher fight awaited against Surrey at The Oval, who had England&#x27;s Test spin combination of Laker and Tony Lock. Miller came in at 3/124 and struggled, scoring 18 runs in his first 120 minutes, his slowest two hours of scoring in his career. As his partners continued to fall Miller ended unbeaten on 57 as Australia were bowled out for 259; Laker taking all ten wickets. Australia lost by ten wickets, its first loss to a county since 1912. As a result, sections of the Australian media began campaigning for Miller to replace Johnson as captain.

By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was shouldering most of the bowling load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He struggled with the bat, making a duck and four. The teams headed to Lord&#x27;s where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and Ken Mackay were called in to make their debut and support Miller with the pace duties. Australia batted first and Miller managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating the burden on Miller. Miller had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from Miller first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged. The next day, Miller beat May four times and then had Watson caught in the gully in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller&#x27;s 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171. Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when Miller came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. Miller removed Graveney at the start of the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185 runs and Miller had bowled 70.1 overs for the match. His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley. Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England&#x27;s 325, and Miller top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on. He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads. In the second innings, Miller fell for 26 to Laker. Australia lost by an innings, for the first time in a Test in 18 years.

The Australian press attacked the team, and called for changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic. Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.

The curator at Old Trafford had been ordered to prepare a dusty, spinning pitch for the Fourth Test. A win for England would see them retain the Ashes. Miller bowled 21 wicketless overs as England amassed 459. Miller was out for six and a duck and fell twice to Laker, who took a world record 19 wickets as Australia lost by an innings. &quot;Wisden&quot; reported that the Australians were said &quot;to be extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch&quot;.

Miller then took 5/84 against Surrey, before leading the team against Warwickshire. He had received death threats in the lead-up to the game, ordering him to lose. He scored 46 not out and took 2/13 as Australia won by an innings. He then took 5/29 in the second innings against Lancashire and made 50 and took match figures of 5/78 against Essex.

On the eve of the Fifth Test at The Oval, Miller announced that the tour would be his last, so that he would retire from cricket after the tour of the Indian subcontinent on the return voyage. In his final Test on English soil, he took 4/91 in the first innings. Miller came in to bat at 5/47 and helped Australia recover to 202, top-scoring with 61. He took another one wicket in the second innings and was unbeaten on seven when stumps were drawn in the second innings. The series ended 1–2. He ended the series with 203 runs at 22.55 and topped the bowling with 21 wickets at 22.23. He topped the first-class bowling for the Australians with 50 wickets at 19.60.

Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in the first Test between the two countries on a matting pitch, rather than the more familiar grass pitch. Miller top-scored in the first innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80. He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat. It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to the point that he could not play in the three Tests against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.

==Style and personality==

Miller combined classy strokeplay with big hitting, his front foot play especially devastating. He had a rifle like straight drive, played pull and sweep shots with a minimum of effort and was able to cut elegantly. He combined this elegance with unorthodoxy, hitting two sixes over square leg with a backhand tennis shot and once beginning the day&#x27;s play in a Test match with a six. One straight six that he hit at the Sydney Cricket Ground was still rising when it hit the first deck of the M.A. Noble Stand. Len Hutton said he was &quot;the most unpredictable cricketer I have played against&quot;.

As a bowler, Miller had a classically high arm action, moving the ball sharply either way and able to make the ball rise from a good length. His action caused opposition batsmen to perceive that his deliveries were gaining pace after pitching. He was often able to generate more pace than his new ball partner, Lindwall. He was always willing to try something new if the batsman were set, varying his approach from fifteen paces to five and vice versa. A round arm delivery often managed to capture a wicket, surprising the batsman. Compton said that Miller &quot;often had no preconceived idea what he intended to bowl even as he turned to start his run&quot;. Miller often mixed slow leg breaks when he was bowling off a run. He once bowled English opening batsman David Sheppard with a googly during a Test. Hutton opined that Miller was the bowler who was least concerned with the position of his bowling mark, and said that he &quot;never felt physically safe against him&quot;. His use of bouncers at Trent Bridge during the 1948 tour was seen as excessive by the English crowd, who booed him. Miller simply sat down until the barracking had subsided. He was often required to bowl through pain, pressing a disk into place at the base of his spine before sending down the next delivery.
Miller and Lindwall formed an opening partnership that was regarded as one of the greatest of all time. Hutton said that the pair was the most hostile that he faced during his career. Alan Davidson, a bowling all rounder who supported Lindwall and Miller for New South Wales and Australia, said that &quot;Ray Lindwall was the best bowler I ever saw of any type; his control was just perfect. At the other end you had Miller, who was unpredictable...It really was a perfect team.&quot; He was an acrobatic slips fielder, who would take freakish catches with nonchalant ease, often immediately returning to his discussion with those around him as if nothing was unusual.

Miller often required a contest to retain interest in the game. He deplored Bradman&#x27;s ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and sometimes refused to try when Australia was in an unassailable position. At Southend in 1948, as the Australians scored a world record 721 runs in a single day against Essex, Miller, coming in to bat when the score was 2/364, allowed himself to be bowled first ball. Indeed, he &quot;turned to the wicketkeeper and said: &#x27;Thank God that&#x27;s over.&#x27;&quot; His teammate Sid Barnes said that if Miller &quot;had the same outlook as Bradman or Ponsford he would have made colossal scores&quot; and become &quot;the statisticians&#x27; greatest customer&quot;.

Miller never captained Australia in a Test, as his attitude to the game tended to alarm the authorities. About Miller, Ashley Mallett wrote, &quot;He loved tradition, but hated convention. His unstructured way of playing and living would be anathema to cricketers now... He played as he fought the war, by impulse and mood.&quot; He sometimes set his field by saying to his players: &quot;scatter&quot;. On another occasion, he is reported turned to his players, after being told that NSW was taking the field with one player too many, and asked for one player to volunteer to &quot;piss off&quot;.

A larger than life character, Miller is the subject of many stories, often apocryphal. One story had Don Bradman answering a knock on the door late one night to see Miller dressed in a dinner suit. Miller advised Bradman that, as demanded, he was in bed at curfew and was now going out. His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy, &quot;one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick&quot;. As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator, his influence grew; this &quot;... almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country&quot;.

One night, following a duel with Messerschmitts in his Mosquito, he made an unauthorised detour over Bonn because it was Beethoven&#x27;s birthplace and he was a lover of the classics. Despite his fame, Miller remained a humble man; when asked his favourite cricketing memory, he would recall no incident concerning himself, but &quot;a South Australian team-mate walking onto Lord&#x27;s to a thunderous ovation a few weeks after his release from a POW camp&quot;. The cricket broadcaster, John Arlott said &quot;that for all the glamour that attached to Miller, he was staunch and unaffected as a friend&quot;.

==Later life==

After retirement, Miller remained in the public eye, augmented by persistent &quot;unsubstantiated rumours of an affair with Princess Margaret&quot;. He made a living as a journalist and columnist, employed by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; as a &quot;special cricket writer&quot; for twenty years. As during his career, Miller was a proponent of attacking and bright play. He praised the aggressive leadership of his protégé Richie Benaud but criticised the style of play pursued by Australia under Benaud&#x27;s successors Bob Simpson and Bill Lawry. In the mid-1980s, when Australia was struggling, Miller called for the removal of Allan Border, an obdurate and defensive batsman, from the captaincy.

He later worked for Vernons Pools, owned by the millionaire horseracing entrepreneur, Robert Sangster. Miller &quot;was happiest at the cricket or at the races&quot;. He also worked as the head of a lobby group in promoting Australian rules football in his adopted New South Wales in the 1980s. At the time, the VFL was the dominant league and there were no top-flight teams in his adopted state or Queensland.

Miller&#x27;s later life was plagued by ill health. In November 1991, he was hospitalised with a stroke, and soon after fell over and broke his hip, necessitating two further operations. He had skin cancer, caused by his insistence on always displaying his mop of hair and not wearing a hat. He accepted these vicissitudes equably. &quot;Some grieved to see him reduced, but not him; these were life&#x27;s deliveries. He knew only that one would get him out eventually.&quot; He had an earlobe removed. The cancer also attacked his legs, and coupled with his hip injury, severely curtailed his mobility, forcing him to use walking frames and wheelchairs. Asked at 75 about death, he said: &quot;Never think about it. No regrets. I&#x27;ve had a hell of a good life. Been damned lucky.&quot;

Despite his illnesses, he continued to travel to England in the 1990s to watch cricket and meet up with Compton, Edrich and other war and cricket colleagues on an annual basis, although he became increasingly isolated as he outlasted his friends, both English and Australian. On 1 January 2001, Miller was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;service to Australian society through the sport of cricket&quot;.

In late 2002, Miller divorced his wife Peg, with whom he had four sons. He did so to marry his long-term mistress Marie Challman, with whom he had been living since 1999. Challman was a hospital receptionist and Miller reasoned that he would receive more effective medical treatment by moving to Melbourne to live with her, as his specialist doctors also lived there. He had other long-term mistresses, including an Australian beauty queen with whom he was photographed in public. During his later years, his illness contributed to what his family felt was a deteriorating attitude and he fell out with his sons, but they were reconciled shortly before his death.

Miller died on 11 October 2004 after being in persistent poor health. The Victoria Government gave him a state funeral that saw hundreds of mourners stand outside the packed cathedral, and was broadcast across the nation on ABC Radio. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2005 Australia Day Honours for &quot;service to sport, particularly cricket as a player, journalist and commentator&quot;.

==Legacy and statistical analysis==
Miller&#x27;s achievements were recognised by a host of awards during his lifetime and posthumously. Miller was one of the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2000, he was named in the Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century as its vice-captain. In January 2009, Miller was announced as one of the inaugural inductees in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, having previously been included in the Federation of International Cricketers&#x27; Associations (FICA) Hall of Fame. ESPN writer Steven Lynch wrote that Miller &quot;was more than a cricketer ... he embodied the idea that there was more to life than cricket&quot;.

He is also one of only four Australian cricketers to be honoured with a portrait in the Long Room at Lord&#x27;s in London. Miller is one of only three men to have his name on both the batting and bowling honours boards in the visitors&#x27; dressing-room there, for scoring both a century and for taking five wickets in a test at the ground.

Miller&#x27;s abilities as an all-rounder led to enormous success as both batsman and bowler. The ICC player rankings have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Miller achieved top ten rankings with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he peaked at ninth in the world in 1952, and was a top-20 player from shortly after his début and for the rest of the duration of his career. Miller&#x27;s bowling abilities led to even greater success. By the end of 1946, he was already ranked sixth in the world and thereafter never slipped lower than ninth; for much of his career, he was the second-best bowler in the world according to the ratings, remarkably, for a 36-year-old, peaking at the number 1 slot for a few months in 1956. As an all-rounder, therefore, it is unsurprising to find that he was peerless for most of his career, ranked as number one in the world for most of his career, including an unbroken eight-year run from June 1948 until his retirement.

Miller&#x27;s statistics are an inexact measure of his worth to the side. Many of the Australia teams he played in featured very strong batting line-ups, restricting his opportunities as a middle-order player. His verve and enthusiasm were also important contributors to Australian success, as was his ability to produce the unexpected (particularly with the ball) and help break partnerships. It is for this reason that he is remembered for his personality and his one-off feats, more than statistical accomplishment; in Ian Chappell&#x27;s words &quot;People who saw it still talk of Keith Miller&#x27;s monster shot that hit the Members Stand clock at the SCG in the 1950s&quot;.

<text>TaJuan Akeem Perry (born August 15, 1975), better known by his stage name Big Noyd, is an American rapper. He is closely affiliated with Mobb Deep and is featured on all of their albums except &quot;Blood Money&quot;.

==Career==
Big Noyd&#x27;s debut was his verse on &quot;Stomp &#x27;Em Out&quot; from Mobb Deep&#x27;s 1993 debut &quot;Juvenile Hell&quot;, but it was not until 1995, on Mobb Deep&#x27;s album &quot;The Infamous&quot;, that Big Noyd attracted wider attention. He appeared on &quot;Right Back At You&quot;, “Party Over”, &amp; &quot;Give Up the Goods (Just Step)&quot;. He explained later that he received his first contract, for $300,000, from Tommy Boy because of his verse on &quot;Give Up The Goods (Just Step)&quot;.

His debut album &quot;Episodes Of A Hustla&quot; was released in 1996 on Tommy Boy Records. Noyd was incarcerated at the time of its release. According to Prodigy, the album sold a &quot;disappointing 30,000 copies&quot;. In 2003, Big Noyd returned with his second album, &quot;Only The Strong&quot;. This album, just as his debut, had many Mobb Deep-related features. Noyd attributes the lackluster sales to Landspeed Records&#x27; (which became Traffic Entertainment Group) filing for bankruptcy in an unrelated lawsuit just as the album was being released. In 2004, Big Noyd released his third album, &quot;On the Grind&quot;, also featuring many guest-spots by Mobb Deep-related artists. The album was released independently through Monopolee Records, which Noyd helped to found and released under his full control, preventing issues that happened with Landspeed and Tommy Boy Records. He founded Noyd Inc. in 2007.

He got his rap name from a friend who thought he looked like Domino&#x27;s Pizzas advertising character &#x27;The Noid&#x27;.

==Personal life==
He is of Puerto Rican and African American descent. He has a daughter who still lives in Queensbridge, Queens.

<doc id="1061749" wikidata="Q212220" url="?curid=1061749" title="Battle of Nicopolis">
<text>The Battle of Nicopolis took place on 25 September 1396 and resulted in the rout of an allied Crusader army (assisted by the Venetian navy) at the hands of an Ottoman force, raising the siege of the Danubian fortress of Nicopolis and leading to the end of the Second Bulgarian Empire. It is often referred to as the Crusade of Nicopolis as it was one of the last big Crusades of the Middle Ages, together with the Crusade of Varna in 1443–1444. By their victory at Nicopolis, the Turks discouraged the formation of European coalitions against them. They maintained their pressure on Constantinople, tightened their control over the Balkans, and became a greater threat to Central Europe.

==Background==
There were many minor crusades in the 14th century, undertaken by individual kings or knights. Most recently there had been a failed crusade against Tunisia in 1390, and there was ongoing warfare in northern Europe along the Baltic coast. After the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the Ottomans had conquered most of the Balkans and had reduced the Byzantine Empire to the area immediately surrounding Constantinople, which they blockaded from 1394 on.

In 1393 the Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman had lost Nicopolis — his temporary capital — to the Ottomans, while his brother, Ivan Stratsimir, still held Vidin but had been reduced to an Ottoman vassal. In the eyes of the Bulgarian boyars, despots, and other independent Balkan rulers, the crusade was a great chance to reverse the course of the Ottoman conquest and take back the Balkans from Islamic rule. In addition, the front line between Islam and Christianity had been moving slowly towards the Kingdom of Hungary. The Kingdom of Hungary was now the frontier between the two religions in Eastern Europe, and the Hungarians were in danger of being attacked themselves. The Republic of Venice feared that Ottoman control of the Balkan peninsula, which included Venetian territories like parts of Morea and Dalmatia, would reduce their influence over the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea, and Aegean Sea. The Republic of Genoa, on the other hand, feared that if the Ottomans were to gain control over River Danube and the Turkish Straits, they would eventually obtain a monopoly over the trade routes between Europe and the Black Sea, where the Genoese had many important colonies like Caffa, Sinop, and Amasra. The Genoese also owned the citadel of Galata, located at the north of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, to which Bayezid had laid siege in 1395.

In 1394, Pope Boniface IX proclaimed a new crusade against the Turks, although the Western Schism had split the papacy in two, with rival popes at Avignon and Rome, and the days when a pope had the authority to call a crusade were long past.

The two decisive factors in the formation of the last crusade were the ongoing Hundred Years&#x27; War between Richard II&#x27;s England and Charles VI&#x27;s France and the support of Philip II, Duke of Burgundy. In 1389, the war had ground to one of its periodic truces. Further, in March 1395, Richard II proposed a marriage between himself and Charles VI&#x27;s daughter Isabella in the interests of peace and the two kings met in October 1396 on the borders of Calais to agree to the union and agree to lengthen the Truce of Leulinghem. The support of Burgundy, among the most powerful of the French nobles, was also vital. In 1391, Burgundy, trying to decide between sending a crusade to either Prussia or Hungary, sent his envoy Guy de La Trémoille to Venice and Hungary to evaluate the situation. Burgundy originally envisioned a crusade led by himself and the Dukes of Orléans and Lancaster, though none would join the eventual crusade. It was very unlikely that defense against the Turks was considered a particularly important goal of the crusade. Burgundy&#x27;s interest in sponsoring the crusade was in increasing his and his house&#x27;s prestige and power and, historian Barbara Tuchman notes, &quot;since he was the prince of self-magnification, the result was that opulent display became the dominant theme; plans, logistics, intelligence about the enemy came second, if at all.&quot; In 1394, Burgundy extracted 120,000 livres from Flanders, sufficient to begin preparations for a crusade, and in January 1395 sent word to King Sigismund of Hungary that an official request to the King of France would be accepted.

In August, Sigismund&#x27;s delegation of four knights and a bishop arrived in the court of Paris to paint a description of how &quot;40,000&quot; Turks were despoiling and imperiling Christian lands and beg, on Sigismund of Hungary&#x27;s behalf, for help. Charles VI, having secured a peace with England through the marriage of his daughter, was able to reply that it was his responsibility to protect Christianity and punish Sultan Bayezid. French nobility responded enthusiastically to the declaration; Philip of Artois, Count of Eu, the Constable of France, and Jean Le Maingre, the Marshal of France, declared participation in the crusade the duty of every &quot;man of valor&quot;. Another major participant was John I, future Duke of Burgundy and Count of Nevers at the time. He was one of the principal leaders of the French forces sent to aid in the war. John&#x27;s bravery during the battle earned him the cognomen Fearless (&quot;Sans-Peur&quot;).

==Strength of forces==
According to the Chronica Hungarorum, King Sigismund of Hungary was so delighted at the sight of the large army gathered around him in Buda, he exclaimed in joy: &quot;Who would be so bold as to dare to resist us? If the enormous weight of the sky were to fall on us, with spears that we carry, we would also hold it up so that no harm would come to us.&quot;

The number of combatants is heavily contested in historical accounts. Historian Tuchman notes the Battle of Nicopolis was considered so significant that the number of combatants given by medieval chroniclers ranges as high as 400,000, with each side insisting that the enemy outnumbered them two-to-one, which for the crusaders offered some solace for their defeat and for the Turks increased the glory of their victory. The oft-given figure of 100,000 crusaders is dismissed by Tuchman, who claims that 100,000 men would have taken a month to cross the Danube at Iron Gate, while the crusaders took eight days.

The closest record to a first-person account was made by Johann Schiltberger, a German follower of a Bavarian noble, who witnessed the battle at the age of 16 and was captured and enslaved for 30 years by the Turks before returning home, at which time he wrote a narrative of the battle estimating the crusader strength at the final battle at 17,000, though he also overestimated Turkish forces as a wildly inflated 200,000. German historians of the 19th century attempting to estimate the combatants on each side came to the figures of about 7,500–15,000 Christians and about 12,000–20,000 Turks, while noting that, from the point of logistics, it would have been impossible for the countryside around Nicopolis to have supplied food and fodder for scores of thousands of men and horses. (Medieval armies acquired supplies by taking them from the surrounding area as they marched, as opposed to using the supply lines of modern armies.)

===Composition of crusader forces===

From France, it was said about 5,000 knights and squires joined, and were accompanied by 6,000 archers and foot soldiers drawn from the best volunteer and mercenary companies; totalling some 11,000 men. Next in importance were the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes, who were the standard bearers of Christianity in the Levant since the decline of Constantinople and Cyprus. Venice supplied a naval fleet for supporting action, while Hungarian envoys encouraged German princes of the Rhineland, Bavaria, Saxony, and other parts of the empire to join. French heralds had proclaimed the crusade in Poland, Bohemia, Navarre, and Spain, from which individuals came to join.

The Italian city-states were too much engaged in their customary violent rivalries to participate, and the widely reported and acclaimed English participation never actually occurred. The report of 3,000 English knights comes from contemporary Antonio Fiorentino, and was taken as fact by historian Aziz S. Atiya and others following him. A thousand knights would have actually amounted to &quot;four to six thousand men and at least twice as many horses&quot;, counting foot-soldiers and other retainers. However, there are no records of financial arrangements being made in England to send a force abroad, nor of any royal preparation needed to organize and dispatch such a force. Reports of Henry of Bolingbroke or other &quot;son of the Duke of Lancaster&quot; leading an English contingent must be false since the presence of Henry and every other such son, as well as almost every other significant noble in the land, is recorded at the King&#x27;s wedding five months &quot;after&quot; the crusade&#x27;s departure. Atiya also thought that the invocation of St. George as a war cry at Nicopolis signified the presence of English soldiers, for whom George was a patron saint; but Froissart, who mentions this, claims that the cry was made by the French knight Philippe d&#x27;Eu. Furthermore, there was no collection of ransom money in England to pay for captives, as there was in every other country that had sent men to the battle. Sporadic mention in contemporary accounts of the presence of &quot;English&quot; may be attributed to Knights Hospitaller of the English langue subgrouping, who joined their comrades for the crusade after leaving Rhodes (where the Hospitallers were based at the time) and sailing up the Danube. Possible reasons for the English absence include the increasing tension between the King and the Duke of Gloucester, which may have convinced the two that they had best keep their supporters close, and the antipathy caused by the long war between the English and French, resulting in the English refusing to consider putting themselves under a French-led crusade, regardless of the recently concluded peace.

Nevertheless, obviously inflated figures continue to be repeated. These include 6,000–12,000 Hungarians, about 11,000 French, English and Burgundian troops, about 12,000 Wallachians led by Mircea cel Batran (Mircea the Elder) the Prince of Wallachia, about 6,000 Germans and nearly 15,000 Dutch, Bohemian, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Bulgarian, Scottish and Swiss troops on the land, with the naval support of Venice, Genoa and the Knights of St. John. These result in a figure of about 47,000–49,000 in total; possibly up to 120,000 or 130,000 according to numerous sources, including the Ottoman historian Şükrullah who, in the 1460s, gives the figure of the crusader army as 130,000 in his &quot;Behçetu&#x27;t-Tevârih&quot;.

===Composition of Ottoman forces===
The strength of the Ottoman forces is also estimated at 15–20,000; but inflated figures are common here as well. Numerous sources provide estimates of the size of the army as up to 60,000 including the Ottoman historian Şükrullah, who, writing in the 1460s, gives the figure of the Ottoman army as 60,000 in his &quot;Behçetu&#x27;t-Tevârih&quot;; alternately described as roughly half of the Crusader army. The Ottoman force also included 1,500 Serbian heavy cavalry knights under the command of Prince Stefan Lazarević, who was Sultan Bayezid&#x27;s brother-in-law and vassal since the Battle of Kosovo in 1389.

==Journey==
While Philip, Duke of Burgundy, had originally planned to lead the crusade along with John of Gaunt and Louis of Orleans, all three withdrew, claiming that the peace negotiations with England required their presence, though perhaps also because none dared leave the vicinity of the throne if their chief rivals stayed. However, Burgundy retained control of the enterprise he was funding by naming 24-year-old John, Count of Nevers, the Duke&#x27;s eldest son, for nominal command. Burgundy, perhaps recognizing that his son, as well as Constable d&#x27;Eu and Marshal Boucicaut, who were both under 35, lacked the necessary experience, summoned Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy, the most experienced warrior and statesman of the realm, and prevailed on him to be &quot;chief counselor&quot; to Nevers during the crusade. The ambiguity of the crusaders&#x27; command structure would prove to be crucial in the outcome. While Nevers was given a long list of &quot;counselors&quot;, as well as another list of prominent French lords on the crusade with whom Nevers could consult &quot;when it seemed good to him&quot;, the concept of unity of command was not yet embraced by medieval warriors. Rules of discipline for the crusade were decreed at a War Council on 28 March 1396, which included the final provision, &quot;Item, that [in battle] the Count and his company claim the &quot;avante garde&quot;&quot;, revealing that the chivalric code continued to require knights to prove their valor by leading the charge.

===To Buda===
The crusade set forth from Dijon on 30 April 1396, heading to Bavaria by way of Strasbourg via the upper Danube, from where they used river transport to join with Sigismund in Buda. From there the crusader goals, though lacking details of planning, were to expel the Turks from the Balkans and then go to the aid of Constantinople, cross the Hellespont, and march through Turkey and Syria to liberate Palestine and the Holy Sepulchre, before returning in triumph to Europe by sea. Arrangements were made for a fleet of Venetian vessels to blockade the Turks in the Sea of Marmara and for the Venetians to sail up the Danube to meet the crusaders in Wallachia in July.

Coucy was not with the crusader body as it traveled, having been detached on a diplomatic mission to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the Duke of Milan. Furious at French political maneuvering that had removed Genoa from his influence, Gian Galeazzo had been attempting to stop the transfer of Genoese sovereignty to France and Coucy was dispatched to warn him that France would consider further interference a hostile act. The quarrel was more than political. Valentina Visconti, the wife of the Duke of Orleans and Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s beloved daughter, had been exiled from Paris due to the machinations of Queen Isabeau the same month as the departure of the crusade. The Duke of Milan threatened to send knights to defend his daughter&#x27;s honor but, in the wake of the disaster at Nicopolis, it was widely believed that he had relayed intelligence to Bayezid I of crusader troop movements. There is no firm evidence of this and it is likely that Gian Galeazzo became a scapegoat after the fact due to the existing animosity with France, though there remains the possibility that the Duke of Milan, who had murdered his own uncle to ensure his own power, did in fact betray the crusaders. Coucy, his diplomatic mission complete and accompanied by Henry of Bar and their followers, left Milan for Venice, from where he requisitioned a ship on 17 May to take him across the Adriatic Sea, landing in the Croatian port of Senj on 30 May before making his way overland to the rendezvous in Buda. Croatian forces led by Ban Nicholas II Garai moved towards Buda from the coastal town of Nin in June, following a session of the Croatian Parliament, and joined the royal Hungarian army led by Sigismund.

Coucy arrived well before Nevers, who had stopped in the upper Danube for receptions and festivities thrown by German princes. Nevers did not arrive in Vienna until 24 June, a full month behind the crusader vanguard led by d&#x27;Eu and Boucicaut. A fleet of 70 Venetian vessels loaded with provisions was sent down the Danube, while Nevers enjoyed yet more parties thrown by his brother-in-law Leopold IV, Duke of Austria. Nevers then asked his brother-in-law for a staggering loan of 100,000 ducats, which took time to arrange, and eventually arrived in Buda in July.

===Buda to Nicopolis===
Once the leaders had arrived, strategy had to be coordinated with Philibert de Naillac, Master of the Knights Hospitaller, and representatives of the Venetian fleet. Forty-four Venetian ships had carried the Hospitallers from Rhodes through the Aegean into the Sea of Marmara, and some continued into the Black Sea and up the Danube without engaging in battle. The fact that the Turks, who had an inferior naval presence, did not challenge the Venetians for control of the sea is seen as evidence that Bayezid and the majority of his forces were already on the European side.

The War Council in Buda was immediately the forum of a fierce dispute. The previous year, Bayezid had declared that he would attack Hungary by May, yet he had not appeared by end of July. Hungarian scouts sent out as far as the Hellespont could find no sign of him, causing the French to proclaim that he was a coward. Sigismund of Hungary assured the crusaders that Bayezid would come, and advised that it would be wiser to let the Turks make the long march to them, rather than make the same long march to find them. This strategy was rejected by the French and their allies. Coucy, acting as spokesman, stated, &quot;Though the Sultan&#x27;s boasts be lies, that should not keep us from doing deeds of arms and pursuing our enemies, for that is the purpose for which we came.&quot; Sigismund had little choice but to acquiesce, though chroniclers also write that Coucy&#x27;s speech excited jealousy in D&#x27;Eu, who felt that he should have had the honor of spokesman due to his position as Constable of France.

The crusaders began to march down the left bank of the Danube, though part of the Hungarian army veered north to gather the forces of Transylvania and the Mircea the Elder-led forces of Wallachia. The remainder of the Hungarians brought up the rear of the crusader column. As the crusaders moved into Muslim-held territory, pillaging and mistreatment of the population reportedly grew. While crusaders had been reported to engage in periodic pillage and raping while passing through Germany, the indiscipline of the French reportedly reached new heights when they entered &quot;schismatic&quot; lands. Chroniclers also waxed eloquent on the immorality and blasphemy of the crusaders, writing detailed accounts of drunkard knights lying with prostitutes for days, despite writing from at best second-hand accounts. Tuchman cautions that such chroniclers were part of a contemporary tendency to blame the defeat of the crusade on the immorality of the crusaders, and that it is impossible to verify such claims.

At Orşova, where the Danube narrows at the Iron Gates gorge, the column crossed to the right bank using pontoons and boats over eight days. Their first target was Vidin, previously the capital of Western Bulgaria and then under Turkish control. The ruler of Vidin, Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria, having no desire to fight for his Turkish conquerors against an overwhelming force of crusaders, promptly surrendered. The only bloodshed was the execution of Turkish officers in the defending garrison, though the incident served to further convince the French that Turks were incapable of challenging the crusaders in the field.

The next target was Oryahovo (Rachowa), a strong fortress located from Vidin. Frustrated by the lack of opportunity to show their bravery in deeds of arms, the French carried out a forced march at night to reach the castle before their allies, arriving in the morning just as the Turkish forces had come out to destroy the bridge across the moat. In fierce combat the French secured the bridge but were unable to push forward until Sigismund arrived. The forces combined and managed to reach the walls before night forced the combatants to retire. The next morning the inhabitants of Oryahovo agreed to surrender to Sigismund on the assurance that their lives and property would be spared. The French promptly broke Sigismund&#x27;s agreement, pillaging and massacring the town after the gates were open, and later claiming that they had taken the town by conquest because their men-at-arms had topped the walls the night before. A thousand residents, both Turkish and Bulgarian, were taken hostage and the town set ablaze. The Hungarians took the French action as a grave insult to their king, while the French accused the Hungarians of trying to rob them of the glory of victory through combat.

Leaving a garrison to hold Oryahovo, the crusaders continued towards Nicopolis, assaulting one or two forts or settlements along the way, but bypassing one citadel from which messengers escaped to inform Bayezid of the Christian army. On 12 September the crusaders came within view of the fortress of Nicopolis on its limestone cliff.

==Siege of Nicopolis==

Nicopolis, located in a natural defensive position, was a key stronghold controlling the lower Danube and lines of communication to the interior. A small road ran between the cliff and river, while the fortress was actually two walled towns, the larger one on the heights on the cliff and the smaller below. Further inland from the fortified walls, the cliff sloped steeply down to the plain. Well-defended and well-supplied, the Turkish governor of Nicopolis, Doğan Bey, was certain that Bayezid would have to come to the aid of the town and was prepared to endure a long siege.

The crusaders had brought no siege machines with them, but Boucicaut optimistically stated that ladders were easily made and worth more than catapults when used by courageous men. However, the lack of siege weapons, the steep slope up to the walls and the formidable fortifications made taking the castle by force impossible. The crusaders set up positions around the town to block the exits, and with the naval blockade of the river, settled in for a siege to starve out the defenders. Nevertheless, they were convinced that the siege of the fortress would be a mere prelude to a major thrust into relieving Constantinople and did not believe that Bayezid I would arrive so speedily to give them a real battle.

Two weeks passed as the bored crusaders entertained themselves with feasts, games, and insulting the martial prowess of their enemy. Whether through drunkenness or carelessness, the crusaders posted no sentries, though foragers venturing away from the camps brought word of the Turks&#x27; approach. Bayezid was at this time already through Adrianople and on a forced march through the Shipka Pass to Tirnovo. His ally Stefan Lazarević of Serbia joined him on the way. Sigismund had sent 500 horsemen to carry out reconnaissance in force around Tirnovo, to the south, and they brought word back that the Turks were indeed coming. Word also reached the besieged inhabitants of Nicopolis, who blew horns and cheered. Boucicaut claimed the noise of their celebration was a ruse as he believed that the Sultan would never attack; he further threatened to cut off the ears of anyone who discussed rumors of the Turks&#x27; approach as being damaging to the morale of the crusaders.

One of the few to concern himself with scouting the situation was de Coucy, who took a group of 500 knights and 500 mounted archers south. Learning of a large group of Turks approaching through a nearby pass, he separated 200 horsemen to carry out a feint retreat, drawing the pursuing Turks into an ambush where the rest of his men, waiting concealed, attacked their rear. Giving no quarter, de Coucy&#x27;s men killed as many as they could and returned to the camp where his action shook the camp from its lethargy and drew the admiration of the other crusaders. Tuchman argues that it also increased the overconfidence of the French and again drew the jealousy of D&#x27;Eu, who accused Coucy of risking the army out of recklessness and attempting to steal glory and authority from Nevers.

Sigismund called a war council on the 24th, in which he and Mircea of Wallachia suggested a battle plan in which the Wallachian foot soldiers, who had experience in fighting the Turks, would be sent in the first attack to meet the Turkish vanguard; this was usually a poorly armed militia, normally used for pillage but used in battle to tire opponents before they met better quality Turkish forces. Sigismund claimed that this vanguard was not worthy of the attention of knights. Sigismund proposed that, once the shock of first clash had passed, the French form the front line to rush in, while the Hungarians and the other allies follow to support the attack and keep the sipahis (Turkish heavy cavalry) from sweeping around the crusaders&#x27; flanks. D&#x27;Eu denounced the proposal as demeaning to the knights, who would be forced to follow peasant footmen into battle. He reportedly stated, &quot;To take up the rear is to dishonor us, and expose us to the contempt of all&quot; and declared that he would claim front place as Constable and anyone in front of him would do him mortal insult. In this he was supported by Boucicaut; Nevers, reassured by the confidence of the younger French lords, was easily convinced.

With the French set on a charge, Sigismund left to make a battle plan for his own forces. Apparently within hours, he sent word to the camp that Bayezid was only six hours away. The crusaders, said to be drunk over dinner, reacted in confusion; some refused to believe the report, some rose in panic, and some hastily prepared for battle. At this point, supposedly because of a lack of spare guards, the prisoners taken at Rachowa were massacred. Even European chroniclers would later call this an act of &quot;barbarism&quot;.

==Battle==

At daybreak on 25 September the combatants began to organize themselves under the banners of their leaders. At this point, Sigismund sent his Grand Marshal to Nevers to report that his scouts had sighted the Turkish vanguard and asked for the offensive to be postponed for two hours, when his scouts would have returned with intelligence as to the numbers and disposition of the enemy. Nevers summoned a hasty council of advisors, in which Coucy and Jean de Vienne, admiral of France and the eldest French knight on the crusade, advised obeying the wishes of the Hungarian king, which seemed wise to them. At this, D&#x27;Eu declared that Sigismund simply wished to hoard the battle honors for himself and declared his willingness to lead the charge. Coucy, who declared D&#x27;Eu&#x27;s words to be a &quot;presumption&quot;, asked for the counsel of Vienne, who noted, &quot;When truth and reason cannot be heard, then must rule presumption.&quot; Vienne commented that if D&#x27;Eu wished to advance, the army must follow, but that it would be wiser to advance in concert with the Hungarians and other allies. D&#x27;Eu rejected any wait and the council fell into a fierce dispute, with the younger hawks charging that the elder knights were not prudent, but fearful. The argument seems to have been settled when D&#x27;Eu decided to advance.

D&#x27;Eu took control of the vanguard of the French knights, while Nevers and Coucy commanded the main body. The French knights, accompanied by their mounted archers, rode out with their backs to Nicopolis to meet the Turks, who were descending the hills to the south. The Knights Hospitaler, Germans, and other allies stayed with the Hungarian forces under Sigismund. The subsequent events are obscured by conflicting accounts. Tuchman notes, &quot;Out of the welter of different versions, a coherent account of the movements and fortunes of the battlefield is not to be had; there is only a tossing kaleidoscope.&quot; The French charge crushed the untrained conscripts in the Turkish front line and advanced into the lines of trained infantry, though the knights came under heavy fire from archers and were hampered by rows of sharpened stakes designed to skewer the stomachs of their horses. Chroniclers write of horses impaled on stakes, riders dismounting, stakes being pulled up to allow horses through, and the eventual rout of the Turkish infantry, who fled behind the relative safety of the sipahis. Coucy and Vienne recommended that the French pause to reform their ranks, give themselves some rest and allow the Hungarians time to advance to a position where they could support the French. They were overruled by the younger knights who, having no idea of the size of the Turkish force, believed that they had just defeated Bayezid&#x27;s entire army and insisted on pursuit.

The French knights thus continued up the hill, though accounts state that more than half were on foot by this point, either because they had been unhorsed by the lines of sharpened stakes or had dismounted to pull up stakes. Struggling in their heavy armor, they reached the plateau on the top of the slope, where they had expected to find fleeing Turkish forces, but instead found themselves facing a fresh corps of sipahis, whom Bayezid had kept in reserve. As the sipahis surged forward in the counterattack sounding trumpets, banging kettle drums and shouting the &quot;Tekbir&quot;, the French realized how desperate their situation was and some knights fled back down the slope. The rest fought on, &quot;no frothing boar nor enraged wolf more fiercely&quot;, in the words of one contemporary chronicler. Admiral de Vienne, to whom was granted the honor as the eldest knight of carrying the French standard into battle, was wounded many times as he attempted to rally his countrymen before being struck down. Other notable knights who were slain include Jean de Carrouges, Philippe de Bar, and Odard de Chasseron. The Turks threatened to overwhelm Nevers, and his bodyguard threw themselves to the ground in submission to plead for the life of their liege lord. Notwithstanding the declaration of jihad, the Turks were as interested in the riches that could be gained by ransoming noble captives as anyone else, and took Nevers prisoner. Seeing Nevers taken, the rest of the French yielded.
The timeline of events is hazy, but it appears that as the French were advancing up the slope, sipahis were sweeping down along the flanks in an envelopment. Accounts tell of the Hungarians and other nationalities in confused combat on the plain and of a stampede of riderless horses, which Tuchman speculates pulled free from their tethers, at the sight of which the Transylvanians and the Wallachians concluded that the day was lost and abandoned the field. Sigismund, the Master of Rhodes, and the Germans fought to prevent the envelopment with &quot;unspeakable massacre&quot; on both sides. At this point, the Turks received a reinforcement of 1,500 Serbian knights under the command of Stefan Lazarević, which proved critical. Sigismund&#x27;s force was overwhelmed. Convinced to flee, Sigismund and the Master managed to escape on a fisherman&#x27;s boat to the Venetian ships in the Danube. Count Hermann of Cilli, governor of Habsburg Carniola and a cousin of Sigismund&#x27;s deceased wife, led the force that allowed the escape and would later become the king&#x27;s father-in-law. Bayezid and his vassal Stefan Lazarević recognized Nicholas II Garai, Lazarević&#x27;s brother-in-law, fighting on Sigismund&#x27;s side. A deal was made, and Sigismund&#x27;s army surrendered, completing their defeat in detail.

==Aftermath==
Sigismund would later state to the Hospitaller Master, &quot;We lost the day by the pride and vanity of these French. If they believed my advice, we had enough men to fight our enemies.&quot; Chronicler Jean Froissart would declare. &quot;Since the Battle of Roncesvalles when [all] twelve peers of France were slain, Christendom received not so great a damage.&quot;

===Captives and ransom===
Bayezid toured the battlefield later that day, hoping to find the corpse of the King of Hungary. His rage was only heightened by the discovery of the massacred prisoners from Rahovo. He ordered all of the prisoners assembled before him the following morning (26 September). The Turks recognized Jacques de Helly, a French knight who had served under Murad I, and had him identify the chief nobles for ransom. Coucy, Bar, D&#x27;Eu, Gui de La Tremoïlle and several others were grouped with Nevers to be spared. Those judged to be under the age of 20 were taken as slaves by the Turks.

The rest, thought to number several thousand, were bound together in groups of three or four and had their hands tied to be marched naked before the Sultan. Ordered to proceed, a group of executioners proceeded to kill each group in turn, either by decapitation or by severing their limbs from the body. Nevers and the rest of the noble captives were forced to stand beside Bayezid and watch the executions. Jean Le Maingre, called &quot;Boucicaut&quot;, was recognized in the line, and Nevers fell to his knees before the Sultan and indicated with intertwined fingers that they were like brothers. Thus convinced that Boucicaut was worth a noble ransom, he was spared and grouped with the other high nobles. The killing continued from early morning until late afternoon, at which point Bayezid, either himself sickened by the bloodshed or convinced by his ministers that he was unnecessarily enraging Christendom against him, called off the executioners. Leaving aside the more hyperbolic account, the number of dead is said to have ranged from 300 to 3,000, though the number of dead on the battlefield was much more.

Of those who fled the battlefield, few survived. So many attempted to swim to the boats in the Danube that several sank from the load; afterward, those on the boats pushed away those trying to board. Many who attempted to swim all the way across the river drowned. Sigismund, fearful of Wallachian treachery, sailed to the Black Sea and Constantinople before making his way home by sea. Those Crusaders who made it across the Danube and tried to return home by land found that the land they were traveling over had already been stripped of forage by the retreating force of Wallachians. Reduced to wandering through the woods in rags and robbed of whatever possessions they had, many of the starved survivors died along the way. Perhaps the most famous of the few who reached home after this journey was Count Rupert of Bavaria , eldest son of the future King Rupert of Germany, who arrived at his doorstep in beggar&#x27;s rags and died several days later from his trials.

The captives were forced to march the 350-mile length to Gallipoli, stripped of clothing down to their shirts and most without shoes, with hands tied and beaten by their captors. At Gallipoli, the noble captives were kept in the upper rooms of a tower while the 300 prisoners that were the Sultan&#x27;s share of the common captives were kept below. The ship carrying Sigismund passed within half a mile of the tower as it went through the Hellespont, for which the Turks lined the captives along the shore and mockingly called out for Sigismund to come and rescue his comrades. Sigismund, while in Constantinople, had made overtures to ransom the captives, but Bayezid was aware that Hungary&#x27;s wealth had been depleted in the crusade and that richer ransoms could be had from France. After two months in Gallipoli, the prisoners were transferred to Bursa, the joint Ottoman capital located in Asia, where they awaited word of their ransom.

In the first week of December, rumors of unimaginable defeat arrived in Paris. As no certain news was to be had, rumor-mongers were imprisoned in the Grand Châtelet and, if convicted of lying, sentenced to death by drowning. The King, Burgundy, Orleans and Duc de Bar all sped envoys to Venice and Hungary to bring word back. On 16 December merchant ships brought word to Venice of defeat at Nicopolis and the escape of Sigismund.

Jacques de Helly, the knight who had identified the nobles after the battle, had been charged by Bayezid, under his vow to return, to inform the King of France and Duke of Burgundy of his victory and demands for ransom. On Christmas, de Helly rode into Paris and, kneeling before the king, recounted the expedition, the battle, defeat and Bayezid&#x27;s massacre of the prisoners. He also carried letters from Nevers and the other noble captives. Those for whom he did not carry letters were assumed to be dead, and weeping members of the court gathered around de Helly to seek more information about loved ones. According to the Monk of St. Denis, &quot;affliction reigned in all hearts&quot; and Deschamps wrote of &quot;funerals from morning to eve&quot;. 9 January was declared a day of mourning throughout France and that day &quot;it was piteous to hear the bells toiling in all the churches in Paris.&quot;

A delegation with rich gifts for Bayezid left Paris on 20 January 1397 to negotiate the ransoms. De Helly, bound by his oath to return, had already departed with letters for the captives. Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s help became vital, as he had extensive contacts in the Ottoman court. Envoys were sent informing him of belated approval by the King allowing the fleur-de-lis to be added to the Visconti escutcheon, Galeazzo&#x27;s first wife having been from the French royal house, and to make every effort to gain his assistance. Meanwhile, those envoys sent in early December had reached Venice and, having learned of the fate of the captives, were attempting to make their way to Bursa. Venice, which was the French conduit to the Muslim east due to her trade network, became the center for exchange of news, cash and ransomed captives.

On 13 February 1397, de Coucy, ill and perhaps suffering from battle wounds, died. Released on their own accord to seek funds in the Levant, Boucicaut and Guy de Tremoille reached Rhodes, where de Tremoille fell ill and died around Easter. French negotiators in the Sultan&#x27;s court finally reached agreement on a ransom of 200,000 gold florins in June. Comte d&#x27;Eu died on 15 June. With a down payment of 75,000, the prisoners were released on 24 June on their promise to stay in Venice until the rest of the ransom was paid. However, the nobles found it unthinkable to travel in less than their accustomed splendor and borrowed nearly as much as the ransom amount in reprovisioning themselves. Arriving in Venice in October after stopping in various islands to recover and borrow money, the financial transactions required to both provide the ransom and pay for the travel arrangements and living expenses of the nobles were tremendously complicated. A three-sided transaction between Burgundy, Sigismund and Venice took 27 years to settle. A plague outbreak in Venice required the nobles to move temporarily to Treviso, but still claimed Henri de Bar.

The last of the Crusader leaders (Nevers, Boucicaut, Guillaume de Tremoille and Jacques de la Marche), along with seven or eight other knights, re-entered France in February 1398. They were greeted by minstrels, parties and parades as they journeyed across the kingdom, though Tuchman notes, &quot;the receptions probably represented not so much popular enthusiasm as organized joy, in which the 14th century excelled.&quot;

===Broader ramifications===
With a historian&#x27;s hindsight Johan Huizinga remarked upon &quot;the lamentable consequences of statecraft recklessly embarking on an enterprise of vital import in the spirit of a chivalrous adventure&quot;, though participants and contemporary chroniclers did not analyse the event in these terms.

After this defeat, Western Europe made no further moves to stop the Turkish advance in the Balkans until the 1440s. England and France soon renewed their war. Wallachia continued its stance against the Ottomans, repelling expeditions in 1397 and 1400. In 1402 Sultan Bayezid I was defeated and captured by Timur (Tamerlane), and Mircea cel Batran and the Kingdom of Hungary took advantage of the resulting anarchy to campaign against the Ottomans. The Hungarians, Poles and Wallachians were defeated at the Battle of Varna in 1444, and Constantinople finally fell in 1453 to the Turks, followed by the Despotate of Morea in 1460, the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, and the Principality of Theodoro in 1475, which brought an end to the last vestiges of the Eastern Roman Empire, as well as the final remaining pockets of Greek resistance against the Ottoman Turks in both the Balkans and Anatolia.

The Battle of Nicopolis is also widely regarded as the end of the Second Bulgarian Empire, since hopes for its revival had come to an end with the defeat of the Crusaders. Its last ruler, Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria, was captured and killed in Bursa.

By their victory at Nicopolis, the Turks discouraged the formation of future European coalitions against them. They maintained their pressure on Constantinople, tightened their control over the Balkans, and became a greater threat to central Europe.

<text>Reuben Carlton &quot;Carl&quot; Baker, Sr. (July 18, 1872 – September 29, 1957) was an American oil industry drilling pioneer. He established Baker Oil Tools in 1907 after developing a casing shoe that revolutionized cable tool drilling. In 1903, he introduced the offset bit for cable tool drilling to enable casing wells in hard rock and in 1912 the cement retainer that allowed casing to be cemented in the wells. Baker further improved the process with the float shoe in 1923. Having only a third grade education, he obtained more than 150 patents on oil drilling tools. Baker Oil Tools merged with Hughes Tool Company in 1987 to form Baker Hughes Incorporated.

== Personal life ==

On December 12, 1897, he married his childhood sweetheart Minnie Myrtle Zumwalt (October 24, 1870 – April 20, 1947). They moved to Coalinga from Los Angeles in 1899. They had two children, Thelma Ellen Baker (January 9, 1901 – April 13, 1986; later Anderson) and Reuben Carlton Baker, Jr. (October 18, 1902 – October 1, 1965).

== Early life ==

Baker was born to Mary Elizabeth (née Stroud) and Reuben Baker in Purcellville, Virginia, and grew up in Shasta County, California. His father, a Civil War veteran from Chester County, Pennsylvania, had a farm that was not very productive. Baker never advanced beyond the third grade. In 1895, at age 23, he decided to go to Alaska to prospect for gold. He got as far as Redding, California, when he ran out of money. He worked in a stone quarry and slept in a barn for two weeks, earning $24, but his clothes were stolen from the barn one day while he worked. An acquaintance suggested he head south instead, where oil had been discovered in Southern California.

== Career ==
Baker&#x27;s older brother, Aaron Alphonso Baker, Sr. (December 10, 1867 – September 15, 1942) had been a dry goods merchant in Fall River Township, Shasta County before he went into the oil business.

Baker&#x27;s followed his brother Aaron into the oil business. He arrived in Los Angeles on April 4, 1895, with a new suit and 95 cents in his pocket. His first job was driving a horse team hauling oil in the Los Angeles City Oil Field for USD$2.00 for a 12-hour day. He soon got a job as an oilwell pumper, and then as a tool dresser for Irving Carl, a contract driller. When Carl couldn’t pay Baker’s wages, he made him his partner instead. Two years later, they had two rigs and a profitable business. In 1898, they divided their assets.

In 1899, Baker moved to Coalinga, California, where he continued as a drilling contractor, introducing one of the first rotary rigs in the San Joaquin Valley that same year. As he drilled he began to discover ways he could improve the equipment. He invented an improved drill bit with a dovetail groove in the side with a hole extending across the groove with a shank, key, and screw. He intended to continue as a contract driller and use his improvements to make his drilling business more competitive. After encountering layers of hard rock in the Coalinga area, Baker developed an offset bit for cable tool drilling that made it easier to get casing down a freshly drilled hole.

Baker and his brother Aaron formed the Coalinga Petroleum Company on January 23, 1905, capitalized with USD$75,000, initially owning six wells in Fresno County, They sold the business to Samuel Allen &quot;Al&quot; Guiberson, Jr. on December 20, 1920. In 1909, Baker&#x27;s competitor Howard R. Hughes, Sr. patented the first roller cone drill bit, which made it possible to drill through deeper, harder rock. This was the basis for the Hughes Tool Company.

Baker organized the St. Paul Consolidated Oil Company on September 24, 1910, with USD$600,000 in capital. Baker was president and W. T. Knowles was secretary. They owned five wells in Fresno County. Four years later, on January 4, 1911, Baker formed the Coalinga Lost Hills Oil Company with USD$75,000 in capital. He served as president and Robert Lee Peeler as secretary.

In 1912, Baker invented a way to make cementing more efficient and effective. The Baker Cement Retainer was designed to pack off between the casing and tubing when pumping cement through tubing. He then started working on a casing shoe, a device to ensure the uninterrupted flow of oil through a well at the bottom of the casing. The next year, Baker organized the Baker Casing Shoe Company to take advantage of changes in U.S. income tax law, to hold his patents, and to collect royalties from the patents. He licensed the invention to third parties to manufacture, market, and use the casing shoe, while he continued in the contract drilling business. Over the next five years, the company received from $600 to $1,500 per month in royalties. By 1918 he decided the leasing business had greater opportunity and bought a machine shop in Coalinga. He left the contact drilling business and concentrated on finding ways to improve drilling tools. He patented those improvements and began selling the tools to other drillers.

Baker formed other businesses. With his brother Aaron formed the Future Success Oil Company, with Carl as president and Aaron as secretary, with USD$100,000 of capital on May 3, 1913. His business interests included farming and oil production companies.

When he needed a better base of operations for the company he moved back to Los Angeles and bought a yard on Slauson Avenue. In 1921 he started working on an improved and simplified dump bailer, and also a cement retainer. At the same time the Long Beach Oil Field was discovered and with that Baker returned to the Los Angeles area.

== Death and legacy ==

Carl Baker, Sr. died in Whittier, California, in 1957 at the age of 85. Baker Oil Tool Company and Hughes Tool Company merged in 1987 to form Baker Hughes Incorporated. By then both were global oilfield service leaders with many innovative product lines.

== Patents ==

Baker received more than 150 U.S. patents in his lifetime. A few of the early patents that Baker received included:

* &quot;Drilling Bit&quot;, patented December 22, 1903
* &quot;Gas Trap for Oil Wells&quot;, patented August 25, 1908
* &quot;Well Casing Shoe&quot;, patented November 11, 1913
* &quot;Plug for Well Casings&quot;, on November 18, 1913
* &quot;Pump-Plunger&quot;, on June 23, 1914
* &quot;Shoe Guide for Well Casings&quot;, on November 16, 1920

<doc id="1061754" wikidata="Q7512143" url="?curid=1061754" title="Sigil Games Online">
<text>Sigil Games Online, Inc. was a computer game developer based in Carlsbad, California founded in January 2002 by Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler, key development team members who created &quot;EverQuest&quot;, the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game before &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. McQuaid and Butler left Sony Online Entertainment (SOE), the publisher of &quot;EverQuest&quot;, and formed Sigil Games Online to develop &quot;the next big thing&quot;. McQuaid told to the video game website IGN at the time that he was happy to assemble a team of MMORPG developers and to focus on making similar project, as opposed to his work in SOE. Sigil released their only game &quot;&quot; on January 30, 2007 after several well publicized delays and a last minute switch from publishing with Microsoft to publishing again with SOE. In May 2007, SOE acquired key assets of Sigil Games Online. As a result, SOE now owns &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot;, described as Sigil&#x27;s &quot;tent pole property&quot;.

==&quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot;==

McQuaid and Butler formerly worked for Sony Online Entertainment on the team developing &quot;EverQuest&quot;. After their departure, they formed Sigil; in May 2002 Sigil reached an exclusive publishing deal with Microsoft and they began work on &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot;. With the pedigree of the &quot;all-star&quot; team at Sigil and the bravado of CEO Brad McQuaid, there were high expectations for the game among MMO fans and the press.

An early marketing fact sheet for &quot;Vanguard&quot; revealed that the game will be a &quot;vast&quot;, &quot;seamless&quot;, &quot;immersive&quot; virtual world filled with elements of high fantasy, with cutting-edge graphics technology of its time. It stated that Sigil&#x27;s expertise and experience in the field will bring groundbreaking static and dynamic content to the genre, and that &quot;Vanguard&quot; will build upon the successes and strengths of earlier MMORPGs to improve popular game mechanics and features, but also address these pioneering games&#x27; mistakes and deficiencies. The sheet stated that &quot;Vanguard&quot; will focus heavily on interdependence, challenge, and reward, while simultaneously addressing tedious and annoying issues, including camping, excessive downtime and more.

Originally, Sigil worked with Microsoft to co-publish &quot;Vanguard&quot; but after 4 years, and less than one year before the game&#x27;s release, the partnership was quickly dissolved. In May 2006 Sigil negotiated a deal to purchase the rights to &quot;Vanguard&quot; back from Microsoft, and at the same time they arranged a co-publishing deal with Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot; was released on January 30, 2007, co-published by Sigil and Sony Online Entertainment. While initial preview coverage was positive the launch lead to disappointing reviews.

==Acquisition==
Sigil Games Online had around 150 employees at the time they released their only game, &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot;, on January 30, 2007. The development team continued to address the well-documented technical issues users experienced at launch for several months. Four months later, on May 14, the staff of Sigil Games Online were told to meet in the parking lot at 4:30PM and to take with them what they would need for the rest of the day. The employees were told that the launch of the game had not gone well, the company was in financial trouble and they were selling the company to Sony Online Entertainment. Director of Production, Andy Platter, then told the employees that they were all fired.

The following day, Sony Online Entertainment acquired Sigil&#x27;s &quot;key assets&quot;, stating that they will hire approximately fifty of Sigil&#x27;s employees and that Brad McQuaid would be consultant to SOE as a creative advisor for &quot;Vanguard&quot;. Sony Online Entertainment&#x27;s President John Smedley communicated the announcement to &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s playerbase via the game&#x27;s official forums.

<doc id="1061760" wikidata="Q462566" url="?curid=1061760" title="Anne Clark (poet)">
<text>Anne Charlotte Clark (born 14 May 1960) is an English poet, singer and songwriter. Her first album, &quot;The Sitting Room&quot;, was released in 1982, and she has released over a dozen albums since then.

Her poetry work with experimental musicians occupies a region bounded roughly by electronic, dance (techno applies on occasion) and possibly avant-garde genres, with varying hard as well as romantic and orchestral styles.

Clark is mainly a spoken word artist. Many of her lyrics deal critically with the imperfections of humanity, everyday life, and politics. Especially in her early works she created a gloomy, melancholy atmosphere bordering on weltschmerz. She has been considered one of the pioneers in the spoken-word music genre, as well as being acclaimed for her synth-pop and new wave music, especially across Europe.

== Early life ==

Clark was born the daughter of a Roman Catholic Irish mother, Cecilia, and a mixed Scottish and Welsh Protestant father, Herbert. She has one brother, John and mentions in her spoken biography &#x27;Notes Taken Traces Left&#x27; that her mother also had another son who died shortly after being born. Clark recollects her childhood in her spoken biography as being &quot;troubled but loving at the same time&quot;. At the age of 16, she left school. She took various jobs, one of which was as a nurse in a psychiatric hospital. Clark then worked at a local record store (and label), Bonaparte Records. Punk rock was finding its way into London&#x27;s music scene and matched her emotions.

Clark became involved with the Warehouse Theatre, an independently financed stage for bands, that was low on cash. Although the theatre&#x27;s owners initially objected to the strange, pierced punk scene characters and their leather outfits, she was able to successfully arrange the program. Clark managed to fill the theatre with artists like Paul Weller, Linton Kwesi Johnson, French &amp; Saunders, The Durutti Column, Ben Watt (who later became a member of Everything But The Girl), and many others. She experimented with music and lyrics herself and first appeared on stage in Richard Strange&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret Futura&quot; with Depeche Mode. 

Clark worked with Paul Weller to help set up &quot;Riot Stories&quot;. He had put up an article about helping young writers that were unable to be signed up to major record labels. Clark said that at first the relationship was troubled due to him not replying to her letters. She announced &quot;After a pretty heated letter calling out his rudeness, I received one back in the same tone.&quot; Clark subsequently said that the relationship ended up being a strong one, which still exists today.

== Career ==
In 1982, Clark published her first album, &quot;The Sitting Room&quot;, with songs written by herself, the album placed in 11th place on &quot;The Top 100 Albums of 1983&quot;. On the following albums, &quot;Changing Places&quot; (1983), &quot;Joined up Writing&quot; (1984) and &quot;Hopeless Cases&quot; (1987), Clark benefited from an acquaintance from the Warehouse: keyboardist David Harrow contributed all the music as the co-author and producer. The music created by Harrow that Clark read poetry to, such as &quot;Sleeper in Metropolis,&quot; &quot;Our Darkness,&quot; and &quot;Wallies,&quot; have since been considered milestones of the 1980s and 1990s. David Harrow&#x27;s music of &quot;Our Darkness&quot; is sampled in Benny Benassi&#x27;s 2003 hit &quot;Love is Gonna Save Us&quot;.

&quot;Our Darkness&quot; has been considered by &quot;Fact&quot; magazine as one of the 20 best industrial records of all time. &quot;Fact&quot; describe it as &quot;An influential proto-house record&quot;. Clark mentions in her autobiography &quot;Notes Taken Traces Left&quot; that she has no vivid memory of the creative phase of &quot;Our Darkness&quot; however, clearly remembers the exact time and place of writing the words to her other club anthem hit &quot;Sleeper in Metropolis.&quot; Clark was set to start touring in the United States in the late 1980s, however, was subsequently in disagreements with Richard Branson which led her breakthrough in America to be cancelled. Nevertheless, Clark has become a well respected artist across Europe, especially in Germany where she has a cult following.

In 1985, Clark released the album &quot;Pressure Points&quot;. It was created in collaboration with John Foxx, who wrote the music and plays on the first five tracks.. The album features the song &quot;Heaven&quot; which was considered a moderately successful hit across Europe.

In 1987, Clark went to Norway for three years, where she worked with Tov Ramstad and Ida Baalsrud, among others. In co-operation with Charlie Morgan, she released the album &quot;Unstill Life&quot; in 1991 on SPV Records. Tracks included The Moment, Unstill Life, Abuse and Empty Me. This album was also released in the USA on Radikal Records. During 1992, she released a non-album collaboration on maxi-CD (SPV) with Ida Baalsrud, who both played the violin part and co-wrote &quot;If I Could&quot;; furthermore, there was also a remix of &quot;Our Darkness&quot; included on the last track of the CD. In December 1992, Charlie Morgan unexpectedly died of cancer at the age of 36, which caused many planned collaboration projects to be abandoned.

After several months of reorientation, Clark eventually released &quot;The Law is an Anagram of Wealth&quot; in 1993, once again in collaboration with other musicians and completed a major European Tour.

In 1994, Clark ventured into a style that she had not experimented with before: acoustic music. This eventually culminated in the release of &quot;Psychometry&quot; (1994), which featured a concert recorded live on stage in the Passionskirche in Berlin-Kreuzberg.

Clark continuously followed her musical roots and the influences of folk and classical music. Her 1998 album, &quot;Just After Sunset&quot;, a collaboration with Martyn Bates, featured poems by German poet Rainer Maria Rilke translated into English. This album was re-released four years later in 2002 when Clark regained the rights to the album. The re-release included some additional video footage, although it was of rather poor quality.

In 2003, another album joined Clark&#x27;s series of acoustic albums: &quot;From The Heart – Live In Bratislava&quot;, which she recorded together with Murat Parlak (vocals/piano), Jann Michael Engel (cello), Niko Lai (drums and percussion) and Jeff Aug (guitars) in Bratislava, Slovak Republic.

In 2005, Clark joined up with the Belgian act Implant for the album &quot;Self-inflicted&quot;, on which she delivered guest vocals. The album was released via Alfa Matrix Records, which in the meantime had become her home label outside of Germany. She also appeared on the Implant EP &quot;Too Many Puppies&quot;.

2006 saw Clark back again in the recording studio with Implant for the EP &quot;Fade Away&quot;, on which she delivered guest vocals and performed a duet with Leæther Strip&#x27;s Claus Larsen. And she also appeared on the album &quot;Audioblender&quot; by Implant, again released via the Alfa Matrix record label.

In 2008, Clark was in Germany to record her next album &quot;The Smallest Act of Kindness&quot;, which was released in September 2008. This album was dedicated to her late mother &quot;Cecilia Ann Picton-Clark (nee. Murray).&quot; At the end of 2010, Clark released the first chapter of an ongoing project Past &amp; Future Tense, the first release on her own label, After Hours Productions.

In January 2011, Clark contributed an arrangement of the Charles Baudelaire poem &quot;Enivrez-Vous&quot; (&quot;Be Drunk&quot;) to the audio book and radio play &quot;Die künstlichen Paradiese&quot; (&quot;The artificial paradises&quot;), (Hörbuch Hamburg/Radio Bremen).

In 2016, Clark announced she would take a year sabbatical, then in January 2017 collaborated on the song &quot;Donald Trump Praesidend (Quack Quack)&quot; with artist Ludwig.London, intended as a parody in light of the election of Donald Trump.

In July 2017, Clark headlined the W Festival in Belgium alongside acts such as Peter Hook and others.

<text>The Dassault Mirage G, also known as the Mirage IIIG, was a variant of the French Dassault Mirage series of supersonic warplanes, but with a variable-sweep wing. Three prototypes were flown; one single-engined G and two twin-engined G8 examples (which had begun construction as the G4). Various roles, equipment fits and other variants were proposed, but none entered production.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1963 the French defence ministry initiated studies on variable-sweep wing aircraft for dual land and aircraft carrier use in response to the American TFX program (which would lead to the General Dynamics F-111).

Alongside the theoretical research undertaken by ONERA, Avions Marcel Dassault began studies of a Mirage variant. An early study was the Mirage F4G. In 1964 they proposed the model MD800 for a carrier-based two-seat, twin-engined Naval version to meet the DAFNE requirement. Alongside it they also proposed a smaller single-engined Mirage IIIF2G.

The UK was also studying the concept and in 1965 Dassault and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) were jointly contracted to develop an Anglo-French Variable Geometry (AFVG) aircraft. This was to be of the heavier two-seat, twin-engined size. The partnership fell apart when Dassault withdrew over political wrangling in 1967.

Meanwhile the IIIF2G initiative had led to an order for the first Mirage G prototype, to be of single-seat, single-engined configuration. Its rollout in 1967, at much the same time as the larger AFVG was cancelled, led to accusations by the British that Dasault had been undermining them all along.

===Mirage G===
The first variable-sweep aircraft from Dassault emerged as the single-engined, two-seat Mirage G fighter in 1967, essentially a swing wing version of the Mirage F2. The wings were swept at 22 degrees when fully forward and 70 degrees when fully aft and featured full-span double-slotted trailing edge flaps and two-position leading edge flaps.

The first flight was 18 November 1967. The plane was generally well received, however it crashed on 13 January 1971, following total loss of electrical power.

===Mirage G8===

By this time the Mirage G4 had been proposed as a twin-engine, two-seat nuclear strike fighter. A contract was issued in 1968 for two new prototypes, G4-01 and -02. These were intended to be powered by Snecma M53 turbofans in production. However while they were under construction the requirements changed to a dedicated interceptor and the design was modified accordingly. They were completed in this form, now redesignated the Mirage G8.

Mirage G8-01 first flew on 8 May 1971. The second aircraft, G8-02, was finished as a single-seater, with the rear cockpit space adapted to take avionics and faired over. It also had a longer and slimmer nose fitted with a mockup of a Cyrano radar radome. It followed -01 into the air on 13 July 1972.

The G8 was equipped with Thomson-CSF radar and a low-altitude navigational-attack system based on that used in the SEPECAT Jaguar and Dassault Milan. As no funding was included for the Mirage G8 in the 1971-1976 French defence budget the aircraft did not enter production.

Flight trials were relatively successful but no production order ensued, the Mirage G programme being cancelled in 1968. Flying with the Mirage G continued however until 13 January 1971 when the sole prototype was lost in an accident.

===Influence on the LTV V-507===

In the late 1960s, the US manufacturer Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) was seeking technical data on variable-geometry wings, within the framework of a bid for the US Navy&#x27;s VFX carrier fighter contract. As a result of the publicity gained by the Mirage G, LTV sought the assistance of Dassault. Two agreements were signed by Dassault and LTV in 1968: one for general cooperation and the other specifically in regard to variable-geometry wings. Eight Dassault engineers went to America to help with the design. This resulted in two LTV designs, the Vought V-505 and V-507, as well as construction of a full-scale, non-flying mockup of the second design. In the event, the competition was won by another variable-geometry design, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.

One outcome of the visit was a twin-engined two-seat Mirage G5 study. This was effectively an enlarged and navalised G4/G8, to be powered by twin SNECMA-built Pratt &amp; Whitney TF306 turbofans. Length was , and span .

;F4G: Initial study prior to the start of the first prototype. 1963-4.
;MD800: DAFNE submission, 1964.
;G: Single-engined initial prototype. One flown from 1967.
;G0: Advanced trainer/attack variant offered to Australia, in single- and twin-engined versions. Reached mock-up stage.
;G1 and G1M: Productionised G offered to the French and Australian air forces in 1968; the G1M was a Naval variant, subsequently proposed in 1970.
;G2 and G6: Proposed NATO replacement for the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, initially developed in parallel with the G1.

<text>Lucy Kérimée Gutteridge (born 28 November 1956) is a retired English actress. She portrayed Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt in the television miniseries &quot;Little Gloria... Happy at Last&quot; (1982), for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination.

==Personal Life==
Gutteridge was born in London, England, the eldest daughter of Major Bernard Hugh Gutteridge, Legion of Merit, a poet and writer, by his 1947 marriage (divorced 1971) to &quot;Nabila&quot; Farah Kérimée Halim, the daughter of H.H. Prince Muhammad Said Bey Halim of Egypt and his British second wife, &quot;Nabila&quot; Malika (née Morwena Bird). Through her mother, Gutteridge is a great-great-great-granddaughter of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, a Muslim subject of the Ottoman Empire (likely of Albanian ethnicity) who became the father of modern Egypt. She is thus a distant cousin of Egypt&#x27;s last king, Fuad II. She has two sisters, Anne-Marie Morwenna Gutteridge (b. 1958) and Cosima Farah Gutteridge (b. 1962). She married Andrew Hawkins, a son of the actor Jack Hawkins, in London in 1978. They had a daughter, Alice, born 1979.

<doc id="1061772" wikidata="Q120417" url="?curid=1061772" title="Victor Schœlcher">
<text>Victor Schœlcher (; 22 July 1804 – 25 December 1893) was a French abolitionist, writer, politician and journalist, best known for his leading role in the abolition of slavery in France in 1848, during the Second Republic.

==Early life==
Schœlcher was born in Paris on 22 July 1804. His father, Marc Schœlcher (1766–1832), from Fessenheim in Alsace, was the owner of a porcelain factory. His mother, Victoire Jacob (1767–1839), from Meaux in Seine-et-Marne, was a laundry maid in Paris at the time of their marriage. He was baptized in Saint-Laurent Church on 9 September 1804.

He enrolled in the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in 1818, but left one year later and began working at the family&#x27;s porcelain factory in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis. In his teenage years Schœlcher became an opponent of the Bourbon monarchy while frequenting the literary and political salons of Paris. In 1820, at the age of 16, he joined Freemasonry, being initiated into the Parisian lodge &quot;Les Amis de la Vérité&quot; (Grand Orient de France), which was at the time very strongly politicized, not to say openly revolutionary. He later moved to another Parisian lodge, &quot;La Clémente Amitié&quot;.

==Abolitionism==

In 1828, Schœlcher was sent by his father on an eighteen months-long trip in America, as a representative of the family&#x27;s porcelain enterprise. While in the continent he visited Mexico, Cuba, and the southern United States. During this trip he learned much about slavery and began his career as an abolitionist writer, and returning to France in 1830 he published his first writing in the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;, an article titled &quot;Des noirs&quot; (&quot;Of the blacks&quot;), in which he proposed a gradual abolition of slavery. Schœlcher inherited the family business on his father&#x27;s death in 1832, but sold it on in order to dedicate himself to his abolitionism. In the following years he traveled through Europe, and in 1840 went to the West Indies to further study slavery and the results of its abolition in the British colonies. Next he went to Egypt, Greece and Turkey, where he studied Muslim slavery, and finally to West Africa, traveling through Senegal and Gambia between September 1847 and January 1848.

With the knowledge on slavery acquired in his travels, Schœlcher became an advocate for the immediate emancipation of slaves, no longer supporting a gradual process. He published these ideas in &quot;Des colonies françaises: Abolition immédiate de l&#x27;esclavage&quot; (&quot;Of the French colonies: Immediate abolition of slavery&quot;) in 1842, following his return from the West Indies. He was a member of the &quot;Société française pour l&#x27;abolition de l&#x27;esclavage&quot; (&quot;French Society for the Abolition of Slavery&quot;) founded in 1834, modeled after contemporary British abolitionist societies. After the early 1830s he was also a republican activist in France, and was one of the founders of the progressive newspaper &quot;La Réforme&quot; in 1843, to which he was a regular contributor.

Schœlcher elaborated on social, economic, and political reforms he believed would be necessary to the Caribbean colonies after the abolition of slavery. He argued that the production of sugar could continue, though it should be rationalized with the construction of large central factories, and opposed the concentration of land ownership. Schœlcher was the first European abolitionist to visit Haiti after its independence, and had a large influence on the abolitionist movements in all of the French West Indies. He was actively against the debt collected from the Haitians as French slave owners sought reparations for their property lost in the Haitian Revolution.
In February 1848, a revolution in France overthrew the July Monarchy. Schœlcher arrived from Senegal on 3 March, and quickly went to meet with François Arago, the Minister of the Navy and Colonies of the provisional government of the new Republic. Arago appointed him under-secretary of state for the colonies the next day, as well as president of a new commission charged with drafting the immediate abolition of slavery, with Louis Percin and Henri-Alexandre Wallon assigned as secretaries.

Schœlcher had convinced Arago not to wait until the election of the constituent National Assembly, which would be deeply occupied with organizing the new republican institutions, to establish the abolitionist commission, arguing that any postponing of the emancipation could lead to revolt and bloodshed in the colonies. In his capacity as under-secretary of state and president of the commission, Schœlcher prepared and wrote the decree that was issued on 27 April 1848, through which the French government abolished slavery in all of its colonies and granted citizenship to the emancipated slaves.

==Later career==

Schœlcher&#x27;s ultimate success in ending slavery gave birth to a new republican movement in the Caribbean colonies. He was elected deputy to the National Assembly in 1848 by the department of Martinique. The next year he ran for reelection but lost to Cyrille Bissette, a former &quot;free man of colour&quot; and abolitionist, but won in Guadeloupe and was again elected for that department in 1850. He introduced a bill for the abolition of the death penalty, which was to be discussed on the day on which President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte seized power with a coup d&#x27;état, on 2 December 1851, dissolving the National Assembly. The next day Schœlcher, alongside Jean-Baptiste Baudin, was one of the few deputies present at the barricades in Paris to resist the coup.

Schœlcher was then exiled by the new regime. He lived briefly in Belgium before moving to London, where he settled in 1852. In the following years he became an specialist in the work of Georg Friedrich Handel, writing a biography of him in 1857. At the same time he published multiple writings criticizing Napoleon III, formerly president of France and now monarch of the Second French Empire, in works such as &quot;Dangers to England of the alliance with the men of the Coup d&#x27;État&quot;, which Schœlcher wrote in English and published in 1854. During this period he became a friend of fellow republican exile Victor Hugo.

Refusing to take advantage of the amnesty of 1859, Schœlcher only returned to France in late August 1870, after the declaration of war with Prussia. He was appointed staff colonel of the National Guard on 4 September, the day of the deposition of Napoleon III and the proclamation of the Third Republic. Organizing a legion of artillery, he took part in the defence of Paris. In 1871 he was again elected by Martinique for the National Assembly in Bordeaux, where he voted against the peace treaty. During the subsequent Paris Commune insurrection, Schœlcher tried unsuccessfully to mediate peace talks between the insurgents and the French government, and was briefly imprisoned by the communards. Afterwards he continued to serve in the National Assembly as a member of the Republican Union, and was elected senator for life in December 1875.
In 1875, Schœlcher became a member of the &quot;Societé pour l&#x27;amélioration du sort de la femme&quot; (&quot;Society for the improvement of women&#x27;s condition&quot;), and in July 1876 he renewed his proposal for the abolition of capital punishment. In 1882 he co-founded, with Gaston Gerville-Réache, the newspaper &quot;Le Moniteur des Colonies&quot;. Schœlcher published his last work in 1889, a biography of Haitian revolutionary leader Toussaint Louverture (&quot;Vie de Toussaint Louverture&quot;). He died on 25 December 1893 in his house in Houilles, near Paris, aged 89.

==Legacy==
Having never married or left issue, in his will Schœlcher distributed his money and donated his collection to Guadeloupe, which is now housed at the Schœlcher Museum (&quot;Musée Schœlcher&quot;) in Pointe-à-Pitre. First buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, his remains were transferred on 20 May 1949 to the Panthéon on the initiative of Senator Gaston Monnerville from Guiana. Schœlcher had wanted to be buried with his father Marc, who was therefore also interred in the Panthéon. The ashes of Félix Éboué, the first black person to be buried in the Panthéon, were transferred at the same time. In 1981, the newly elected President François Mitterrand placed a rose at Schœlcher&#x27;s tomb in the Panthéon as part of his inauguration ceremony.

===Homages===

<text>James McCulloch (4 June 1953 – 25 September 1979) was a Scottish musician best known for playing lead guitar and bass as a member of Paul McCartney&#x27;s band Wings from 1974 to 1977. McCulloch was a member of the Glasgow psychedelic band One in a Million (formerly known as the Jaygars), Thunderclap Newman, and Stone the Crows.

McCulloch also made appearances on many albums, including John Entwistle&#x27;s &quot;Whistle Rymes&quot; in 1972, as lead guitarist playing alongside Peter Frampton on &quot;Apron Strings&quot; and &quot;I Feel Better&quot;. McCulloch also played guitar on Roger Daltrey&#x27;s album &quot;One of the Boys&quot; which was released in 1977.

McCulloch was a friend of the Who and a member of the band Thunderclap Newman, which was created and produced by his mentor Pete Townshend. His brother is drummer Jack McCulloch.

==Biography==

McCulloch was born in Dumbarton and raised in Clydebank and Cumbernauld, Scotland. The McCulloch family relocated to London when Jimmy was 13. He was inspired by Django Reinhardt and began to play the guitar aged 11.

He made his performance debut as the guitarist for the Jaygars, which was later known as One in a Million. One in a Million performed live in support of The Who during their tour of Scotland in 1967. That year, One in a Million released their &quot;Fredereek Hernando&quot;/&quot;Double Sight&quot; single on MGM. The single is now highly collectable, and an expensive purchase, now classed as a classic and obscure UK psychedelic release. &quot;Double Sight&quot;, a CD compilation of these and other songs written and recorded by the band, was released in 2009.

In April 1967, McCulloch played lead guitar for the Utterly Incredible, Too Long Ago to Remember, Sometimes Shouting at People during The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream event, which was held on the grounds of the Alexandra Palace in London. That year, he played guitar for One in a Million, which performed live at The Upper Cut and other London venues.

McCulloch first rose to fame in 1969 when he joined Pete Townshend&#x27;s friends, Andy &#x27;Thunderclap&#x27; Newman (piano) and songwriter John &#x27;Speedy&#x27; Keen (vocals, drums), to form the band Thunderclap Newman. The band enjoyed a UK No. 1 hit with &quot;Something in the Air&quot; that year. Thunderclap Newman&#x27;s album, &quot;Hollywood Dream&quot;, on which the title instrumental, written by McCulloch and his brother, sold well but was not as successful as their hit single. (Reissues of the album include another McCulloch brothers song, &quot;I See It All&quot;.) From January to mid-April 1971, the band toured England, Scotland, The Netherlands, and Scandinavia and disbanded shortly thereafter.

In October 1971, McCulloch played guitar in concert with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers in England, Scotland and Germany. On 31 October 1971 McCulloch&#x27;s band Bent Frame made its performance debut in London. The band subsequently renamed itself the Jimmy McCulloch Band and toured England and Scotland in support of Leslie West&#x27;s Mountain in February 1972. By then, McCulloch had done session work for Klaus Voormann, Harry Nilsson, Steve Ellis, John Entwistle, and others.

In June 1972, McCulloch joined the blues rock band (and fellow Mayall-school alumni) Stone the Crows to replace guitarist Les Harvey, who had been electrocuted on stage. McCulloch helped Stone the Crows to complete their &quot;Ontinuous Performance&quot; album by playing on the tracks &quot;Sunset Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Good Time Girl&quot;. Stone the Crows disbanded in June 1973.

In 1973, McCulloch played guitar on John Keen&#x27;s album, &quot;Previous Convictions&quot;, had a brief stint in Blue and played guitar on Brian Joseph Friel&#x27;s debut album under the pseudonym &#x27;The Phantom&#x27;.

===Paul McCartney &amp; Wings and after===

McCulloch first met Paul McCartney in August 1973, after the departure of Henry McCullough from Wings. McCulloch joined Wings in August 1974. His debut track with them was &quot;Junior&#x27;s Farm.&quot; McCulloch composed the music for the anti-drug song &quot;Medicine Jar&quot; on the album &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; and the similar &quot;Wino Junko&quot; on &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot;. He also sang both. Colin Allen, who had been drummer for Stone the Crows, wrote lyrics for both songs.

During his time with Wings, McCulloch formed White Line with his brother Jack on drums and Dave Clarke on bass, keyboards, and vocals. They played several impromptu gigs and released a single, &quot;Call My Name&quot;/&quot;Too Many Miles&quot;. A 13-track album, &quot;White Line – Complete&quot;, was released in 1994 on Clarke&#x27;s Mouse Records. Jimmy McCulloch and White Line appeared on the British television programme &quot;Supersonic&quot; on 27 November 1976. In addition, McCulloch recorded and produced two unreleased songs by The Khyber Trifles and had occasionally performed live (in London and their native Glasgow) with the band. Finally, as noted above, he played guitar on Roy Harper&#x27;s album &quot;Bullinamingvase&quot; and Ricci Martin&#x27;s album &quot;Beached&quot;, in 1977.

In September 1977, McCulloch left Wings to join the reformed Small Faces during the latter band&#x27;s nine date tour of England that month. He played guitar on the Small Faces&#x27; album, &quot;78 in the Shade&quot;. In early 1978, McCulloch started a band called Wild Horses with Brian Robertson, Jimmy Bain and Kenney Jones, but both McCulloch and Jones left the band soon afterward. In 1979, McCulloch joined the Dukes. His last recorded song, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, appeared on their only album, &quot;The Dukes&quot;.

A melodic, heavily blues-infused guitarist, McCulloch normally used a Gibson SG and a Gibson Les Paul, and he occasionally played bass when McCartney, Wings&#x27; usual bassist, or Laine were playing piano or acoustic guitar, which he used Fender Precision or Fender Jazz basses. For acoustic guitar work, he used Ovation acoustic guitars.

In 2021, an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Repair Shop&quot; featured two platinum discs for &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot; and &quot;Wings over America&quot;, presented to McCulloch for his work with Wings, which were taken for restoration by his cousin. In the same year, a biography on Jimmy’s life and career, &quot;Little Wing: The Jimmy McCulloch Story&quot;, was published as well.

==Death==
On 27 September 1979, McCulloch was found dead by his brother in his flat in Maida Vale, London. He was 26 years old. An autopsy revealed that he died from heart failure.

The Paul McCartney Project lists several newspaper articles about McCulloch&#x27;s death. The concert film &quot;Rockshow&quot;, from Wings&#x27; 1976 North American tour, was released on 26 November 1980, more than a year after McCulloch&#x27;s death.

<text>Cal Anderson Park is a public park on Seattle’s Capitol Hill that includes Lincoln Reservoir and the Bobby Morris Playfield.

==Features==
The north end of the open park features &quot;Waterworks&quot;, a large mountain-shaped water fountain feeding a shallow texture pool, a reflecting pool, and a wading pool. The south end features the lighted Bobby Morris Playfield. The wading pool operates in the summer months from 12:00 to 7:00 p.m.

Other features:
* Shelterhouse
* Plaza
* Children&#x27;s play area
* Caged tennis courts with outdoor lights
* Basketball courts
* Dodgeball court

==History==
Lincoln Reservoir was begun in 1889 in response to the Great Seattle Fire of the same year and was completed in 1901. A parcel just south of it was named Lincoln Park the same year. The famed Olmsted Brothers designed the park as part of their many works in the Seattle area. In 1908 it was developed as a playfield, and in 1922 its name was changed to Broadway Playfield so as not to duplicate the name of the new Lincoln Park in West Seattle. The playfield was named after Bobby Morris, a former King County, Washington, auditor, in 1980. Meanwhile, the area around the reservoir came to be known as Lincoln Reservoir Park. On April 10, 2003, the entire area was designated Cal Anderson Park, after Washington&#x27;s first openly gay state legislator. Cal Anderson had died in 1995 of AIDS.

From 2003 to 2005, the reservoir was rebuilt as a covered basin.

Three security cameras were installed in the park in April 2008 in an effort to combat certain types of criminal activity, namely vandalism, drug dealing, and public sex.

In 2004, World Naked Bike Ride Seattle established a tradition of stopping briefly in the park, usually in the midsection near the shelter house and water feature. Body Pride ride also began making stops in 2005.

In 2009, Forbes magazine recognized Cal Anderson Park as one of the 12 Best City Parks in the U.S.

The Seattle March for Science took place at the park on April 22, 2017.

On June 8, 2020, protesters occupied the park and declared it part of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). The area was renamed the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) several days later. 

On June 20, 2020, a shooting took place in the park, which served as a gathering area in the CHOP at the time. A 19-year-old man was fatally shot, and a 33-year-old man was critically injured. The incident was cited by opponents of the zone as a justification to disband it, using either the National Guard or the Seattle Police Department. 

On April 29, 2023, a shooting in the park killed two men and critically injured another.

==Light rail station==
The northwest corner of Cal Anderson Park (at the corner of East Denny Way and Nagle Place) contains an entrance to the underground Capitol Hill Station of Sound Transit&#x27;s Link light rail.

<doc id="1061790" wikidata="Q6305395" url="?curid=1061790" title="Venetian Festival">
<text>Venetian Festival is the name of a festival held in cities in Europe and North America. They are based on carnival, or [[Carnival of Venice|carnevale]], the period just before Lent, as celebrated in the 17th century in Venice, Italy. Venetian festivals re-create the fantasy of the earlier events with food, costumes, masks, music, theater, juggling and other spectacles. The masks and costumes are worn by people who often travel from other countries to attend and perform (or parade) in these festivals. The elaborate costumes and masks are handmade by artisans from various countries. Many involve male and female or group versions and are based on old Venetian characters and costumes.

In the U.S., A Venetian Festival is held in Charlevoix, Michigan which started in 1930. There is also a Venetian Festival held in Saugatuck, Michigan.

Another Venetian Festival, in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, has been run by the Lake Geneva Jaycees since 1962.

A Venetian Festival was formerly held annually on the third weekend of July at Silver Beach County Park in St. Joseph, Michigan, a small town on the coast of Lake Michigan in the southwest part of the state. It started in 1979, and grew from a handful of people to nearly 200,000 visitors at the end. Once a two-day event on Friday and Saturday, this festival eventually ran from Thursday through Sunday and featured a variety of amusements. It was discontinued after the 2011 festival.

<doc id="1061797" wikidata="Q1416079" url="?curid=1061797" title="Ron Jaworski">
<text>Ronald Vincent Jaworski (born March 23, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Jaws&quot;, is an American former professional football quarterback who played 17 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Youngstown State Penguins and was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the second round of the 1973 NFL draft. After spending four seasons mostly as a backup for the Rams, Jaworski was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in 1977, where he would lead the Eagles to four consecutive playoff appearances, including a division title and the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl appearance in 1980. After 10 seasons with the Eagles, Jaworski signed with the Miami Dolphins, where he would spend two seasons as a backup.

After his playing career, Jaworski worked as an NFL analyst on ESPN from 1990 to 2017. From 2004 to 2019, he served as an executive of the Philadelphia Soul franchise of the Arena Football League, where he also briefly served as the league&#x27;s Executive Committee Chair from 2018 to 2019. He is also the founder and CEO of Ron Jaworski Golf, which owns and manages several golf courses across the Delaware Valley region.

==Early life and college==
Jaworski was born and raised in Lackawanna, New York. A three-sport star in high school, he turned down a Major League Baseball offer from the St. Louis Cardinals to attend college at Youngstown State University, where he was nicknamed &quot;Rifle Ron&quot; and the &quot;Polish Rifle&quot;, a reference to his Polish ethnicity.

At Youngstown State, he showcased his skills as a quarterback for a pass-oriented offense, earning a selection in the Senior Bowl. Jaworski set several school records during his tenure at Youngstown State, including single-season passing completions (139), career passing completions (325), single-season passing yardage (2,123), career passing yardage (4,612), single-season passing touchdowns (18), and career passing touchdowns (32).

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Rams===

Jaworski was selected in the second round of the 1973 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams. Jaworski was named the third-string quarterback, backing up John Hadl and James Harris, and only appeared in a total of five games through his first two seasons.

In 1975, Jaworski saw his first major playing time in Week 13, when starter James Harris suffered a shoulder injury three plays into the game. Jaworski led the Rams to a 22–5 victory over the Green Bay Packers, where he completed 14 of 24 passes for 174 yards and an interception. The next week, Jaworski made his first career start for the final week of the season, where he led the Rams to a 10–3 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Entering the playoffs, there was speculation as to whether James Harris was healed enough to return or if Jaworski would start for the divisional round game against the St. Louis Cardinals. It was only minutes before gametime when Jaworski was informed by head coach Chuck Knox that he would be starting. In his playoff debut, Jaworski completed 12 of 23 passes for 203 yards with both a passing and rushing touchdown, en route to a 35–23 victory to advance to the NFC Championship Game. Despite Jaworski&#x27;s performance, he was not named the starter for the NFC Championship, as James Harris was deemed healthy enough to return. However, Harris reaggravated his shoulder injury after just two passes in the game, and Jaworski came in as a backup. He completed 11 of 22 passes for 147 yards, but threw two interceptions in the 37–7 loss to the Dallas Cowboys.

Entering the 1976 season, Jaworski was named the Week 1 starter after James Harris fractured his thumb. In the season opener against the Atlanta Falcons, however, Jaworski left the game due to a fractured right shoulder. Backup Pat Haden relieved Jaworski, and led the Rams to a 30–14 victory. In Week 6 against the Chicago Bears, Haden was injured, and Jaworski, although not yet fully recovered, came in and preserved a 20–12 victory. Jaworski started the next week against the New Orleans Saints, but he was benched for Haden in the fourth quarter after completing just 3 of 11 passes for 15 yards. James Harris would start at quarterback for the remainder of the season, and Jaworski would only appear in two other games.

===Philadelphia Eagles===

==== 1977–1979 ====
In March 1977, Jaworski was traded by the Rams to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for former All-Pro tight end Charle Young. Jaworski would be reunited with former Rams quarterbacks coach Dick Vermeil, who was now the head coach for the Eagles.

In the 1977 season, Jaworski started all 14 games for the Eagles, leading them to a 5–9 record on the season. In 1978, Jaworski led the Eagles to a 9–7 record, clinching both a wild card spot and the franchise&#x27;s first postseason appearance in 18 years. In the Wild Card game against the Atlanta Falcons, Jaworski helped the Eagles jump to a 13–0 lead that they would hold into the fourth quarter. However, Steve Bartkowski and the Falcons responded late with two touchdowns, and although Jaworski brought the Eagles to the Falcons&#x27; 16-yard-line with just 13 seconds to play, punter/kicker Mike Michel missed what would have been a game-winning 34-yard field goal, and the Eagles fell 14–13. As of 2024, this Falcons-Eagles playoff game is believed to be first and only time in NFL history where both starting quarterbacks were of Polish heritage.

In 1979, Jaworski led the Eagles to an 11–5 record and a second-straight wild card berth. In the Wild Card game against the Chicago Bears, Jaworski led the Eagles out of a 17–10 halftime deficit as the Eagles rallied to beat the Bears 27–17. Jaworski completed 12 of 23 passes for 204 passing yards with three touchdowns and one interception. In the divisional round game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Eagles quickly fell behind to a 17–0 deficit. Despite an attempted comeback led by Jaworski, the Eagles fell to the Buccaneers 24–17.

====1980: Super Bowl appearance====
In 1980, Jaworski saw perhaps his most successful season in the NFL. The Eagles started out 11–1, en route to a 12–4 record and a NFC East division title. Jaworski threw for 3,529 yards and 27 touchdowns, and received multiple honors, including the Bert Bell Award, the NFC Offensive Player of the Year Award from UPI, and a selection to the Pro Bowl. Jaworski also finished third in AP NFL MVP voting. Facing the Minnesota Vikings in the divisional round, the Eagles trailed 14–7 at halftime, but Jaworski and the Eagles responded by outscoring the Vikings 24–2 in the second half, resulting in a 31–16 Eagles win. Jaworski completed 17 of 38 passes for 190 passing yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.

In the NFC Championship Game, the Eagles would face their division rival, the Dallas Cowboys. In frigid conditions at Veterans Stadium, the Eagles pulled off a strong rushing attack as they went on to defeat the Cowboys 20–7, advancing to their first ever Super Bowl in franchise history.

The Eagles went into Super Bowl XV as slight favorites over the AFC-champion Oakland Raiders. However, Jaworski and the Eagles hit a brick wall, as the Eagles suffered four turnovers and fell behind to a 14–3 halftime deficit. From there, the Raiders kept on with their attack to prevail 27–10 over the Eagles. Jaworski completed 18 of 38 passes for 291 yards while throwing a touchdown and three interceptions with a lost fumble.

==== 1981–1986 ====
In 1981, Jaworski led the Eagles to another strong start to the season, going 7–1 through the first eight games. However, the Eagles went 3–5 in the second half of the season, but still clinched a wild card spot for their fourth consecutive playoff appearance. In the Wild Card game against the New York Giants, the Eagles were unable to overcome 20 first quarter points scored by New York, and despite their best efforts, they ultimately fell to the Giants 27–21. Jaworski went 13 of 24 for 154 yards and one touchdown.

In the 1982 strike-shortened season, Jaworski led the Eagles to a 3–6 record, as the Eagles missed the playoffs for the first time since 1977. Following the season, Eagles head coach Dick Vermeil retired, and was replaced by defensive coordinator Marion Campbell.

Jaworski and the Eagles&#x27; struggles continued into 1983, as the Eagles posted a 5–11 record. In 1984, Jaworski led the Eagles to a 5–7–1 record before he suffered a broken left leg in Week 13 against his former team, the Los Angeles Rams. Jaworski&#x27;s injury ended both his season and his streak of 116 consecutive starts, an NFL record for quarterbacks at the time that stood until 1999, when it was broken by Packers quarterback Brett Favre.

In the second round of the 1985 NFL draft, the Eagles selected quarterback Randall Cunningham. Despite the selection, Jaworski was still intended to be the starter for the Eagles, although Cunningham was intended to be Jaworski&#x27;s successor in the future. However, after a poor performance in Jaworski&#x27;s return from his leg injury in the 1985 season opener, he was benched and replaced by Randall Cunningham for Week 2. Jaworski returned to significant playing time in Week 5, when Cunningham was benched in the second quarter due to poor play. Jaworski threw for three touchdowns in the 23–21 loss to the New Orleans Saints, and was subsequently named the starter for the remainder of the season. In Week 7, Jaworski was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week after a 16–14 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, where he threw for 380 yards and one touchdown. In a Week 10 game against the Atlanta Falcons, he tied an NFL record with a game-winning, 99-yard touchdown pass in overtime to Mike Quick. Jaworski would lead the Eagles to a 7–9 finish on the season, finishing 6–6 as the starter.

At the end of the 1985 season, head coach Marion Campbell was fired and was replaced by former Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan. Leading up to the 1986 season, Ryan had planned for recently acquired quarterback Matt Cavanaugh to be the team&#x27;s starter, however, Ryan ultimately changed his mind days before the season opener, and he named Jaworski the starter. Jaworski led the Eagles to a 2–4 start before he was sidelined due to an elbow injury he suffered just before a Week 7 game against the Dallas Cowboys. Jaworski returned the next week, but was injured again after hurting his finger in Week 10 against the New York Giants. The injury would end Jaworski&#x27;s season, as Randall Cunningham would replace him. After the season, Jaworski was released by the Eagles, ending his ten-season tenure with the team. He finished with a 69–67–1 record as the Eagles&#x27; starter, and held the franchise records for quarterback wins, passing yards, pass completions, pass attempts, and passing touchdowns at the time of his release. Although each of these records were eventually broken by Donovan McNabb, Jaworski still ranks second as of 2024.

===Miami Dolphins===
In August 1987, Jaworski signed with the Miami Dolphins to backup quarterback Dan Marino. Jaworski did not appear in any games in the 1987 season, and appeared in two games during the 1988 season. He was released by the Dolphins following the 1988 season.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
In August 1989, Jaworski signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. While initially backing up quarterback Steve DeBerg, Jaworski made his first start in three years in Week 4 after DeBerg was benched due to poor play. Jaworski went 1–2 as starter, but suffered a sprained knee in Week 6 against the Los Angeles Raiders. Steve DeBerg returned as the starter for the Chiefs, and Jaworski did not appear in a game for the remainder of the season.

=== Retirement ===
Following the 1989 season, Jaworski contemplated retirement, and he was seen as a potential candidate to replace James Florio in the United States House of Representatives. He ultimately never ran for the seat, but he was waived by the Chiefs in July 1990 and subsequently retired from professional football. In his 17-season career, Jaworski threw for 28,190 yards, 179 touchdowns, and 164 interceptions, while also rushing for 859 yards and 16 touchdowns.

==Post-playing career==
===Broadcasting===
Following his retirement, Jaworski joined ESPN as an NFL studio analyst in 1990. He mainly appeared as an analyst on &quot;NFL Matchup&quot;, where he was noted for his skill in breaking down teams&#x27; strategies and gameplans. Jaworski also served as a reporter on &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;. In 2006, Jaworski worked a game as a color commentator with Brad Nessler and Dick Vermeil during the opening-night doubleheader of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. The next season, Jaworski was selected to replace Joe Theismann as a full-time color commentator for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, where he would work alongside Mike Tirico and Tony Kornheiser. In 2009, Kornheiser was replaced by Jon Gruden as the other color commentator on the broadcast with Jaworski. Following the 2011 season, ESPN announced that the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast team would be reduced to just Tirico and Gruden. Jaworski, however, signed a five-year contract extension with ESPN to remain as an NFL analyst on other programming. In 2017, it was reported that Jaworski, along with a number of other ESPN analysts, would be laid off by the network. Jaworski himself was not aware of his future with the network, as he was still under contract with ESPN. Reports eventually came out that ESPN wanted to retain Jaworski, but parent company Disney ultimately blocked it.

Jaworski also worked as a color commentator for Tampa Bay Buccaneers preseason games on WFLA-TV from 2003 to 2006.

Jaworski frequently appeared on 97.5 The Fanatic as an Eagles analyst, and hosted &quot;The Ron Jaworski Show&quot; on the station from 2019 to 2021.

Since 2022, Jaworski has worked for NBC Sports Philadelphia as an analyst on &quot;Eagles Pregame Live&quot; and &quot;Eagles Postgame Live&quot;, where he works alongside Michael Barkann, Barrett Brooks, and Reuben Frank. Also since 2022, Jaworski has also appeared as a weekly guest on Joe DeCamara and Jon Ritchie&#x27;s show on 94.1 WIP.

===Golf===
Throughout his NFL career, Jaworski was an avid golfer, as he spent many off-days at courses. While with the Eagles in 1979, Jaworski and teammate John Bunting managed a golf club in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. In 1984, Jaworski purchased a club in Gloucester County, New Jersey, which is today Tall Pines State Preserve. Today, Jaworski is the CEO of Ron Jaworski Golf, which is based in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. The company owns and operates eight courses throughout Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey, including: Blue Heron Pines Golf Club in Galloway Township, New Jersey, Back Creek Golf Club in Middletown, Delaware, Downingtown Country Club in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, Honey Run Country Club in York, Pennsylvania, Ramblewood Country Club in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, RiverWinds Golf Tennis Club in West Deptford Township, New Jersey, Running Deer Golf Club in Pittsgrove Township, New Jersey, and Valleybrook Country Club in Blackwood, New Jersey.

=== Arena Football League ===
In 2003, Jaworski, along with an ownership group that included Bon Jovi members Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, founded the Philadelphia Soul, an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League. The team began play in the 2004 season, and Jaworski served as the team&#x27;s president until 2009, when the league went into hiatus due to economic issues. After the league returned in 2010, Jaworski led an effort to bring back the Soul, and the team returned to play for the 2011 season. With the departures Bon Jovi and Sambora as co-owners, Jaworski now served as a majority owner of the team alongside Craig Spencer, who was with the previous ownership group. In 2018, Jaworski was appointed to be the chairman of the league&#x27;s executive committee. Jaworski also helped establish two other teams in the AFL, the Albany Empire in 2018 and the Atlantic City Blackjacks in 2019. He served as a partner owner of both of these franchises, but was not involved in the football operations of the franchises in order to prevent a potential conflict of interest due to his ownership of the Soul. After the 2019 season, however, the league folded, and the Philadelphia Soul, Albany Empire, and Atlantic City Blackjacks each shut down. During Jaworski&#x27;s time as an executive for the Soul, the team won three ArenaBowl championships (XXII, XXIX, and XXX).

=== Other ventures ===
Jaworski is also a published author. In 2010, his first book, &quot;The Games That Changed the Game: The Evolution of the NFL in Seven Sundays&quot;, was published. The book highlights seven games in NFL history which greatly changed the strategies and tactics used in professional football.

Jaworski was one of the primary investors and advisors for the Elite Football League of India, which was founded in 2011. Other prominent investors in the league included Brandon Chillar, Mike Ditka, Michael Irvin, Mark Wahlberg, and Kurt Warner.

Jaworski runs the Jaws Youth Playbook, a charity foundation that assists at-risk youth in the Delaware Valley.

==Personal life==
, Jaworski lives in Medford, New Jersey. He and his wife, Liz, have three children.

While Jaworski played for the Eagles, he was friends and next-door neighbors with former Philadelphia 76ers guard Doug Collins. Collins is credited with coining Jaworski&#x27;s now well-known nickname &quot;Jaws&quot;.

<text>Alexandra Lendon Bastedo (9 March 1946 – 12 January 2014) was a British actress, best known for her role as the beautiful secret agent Sharron Macready in the 1968 British espionage/science fiction adventure series &quot;The Champions&quot;. Bastedo was a vegetarian and animal welfare advocate, and wrote a number of books on both subjects.

==Early life==
Bastedo was born in Hove, England. Her mother (Liberiana Dorina Rescagliova 1917–2001) was of French, German and Italian descent, while her Canadian-born father (Gilbert Lendon Bastedo 1915–1985) was of Spanish, Dutch, Scottish and native American extraction. She attended Brighton and Hove High School and Brighton School of Drama.

==Professional career==
Bastedo made her film debut as one of the title characters in William Castle&#x27;s poorly received &quot;13 Frightened Girls&quot; (1963). She gained attention on the European continent, earning her the nickname, &quot;La Bastedo&quot;. One of her first appearances in popular culture was in the 1966 film &quot;Doctor in Clover&quot; where she appears as a young nurse dancing with Sir Lancelot at a party (a non-speaking role).

Although most familiar to viewers of 1960s TV as Sharron Macready in &quot;The Champions&quot;, she was also known for her language skills, speaking Italian, Spanish, French and German. This ability brought her to the attention of 10 Downing Street, where she was employed to assist with translations, and landed her the role of co-presenter of Miss World competitions with Peter Marshall in the 1980s.

In 1979, she played in the series &quot;The Aphrodite Inheritance&quot;. In 1988, Bastedo was the cover star for &quot;Rank&quot;, a live album by British band The Smiths that charted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1992, she appeared in &quot;Fat&quot; – the second broadcast episode of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, playing a 1960s model associate of Edina and Patsy. She was seen in two episodes of &quot;The Saint&quot; series, alongside Roger Moore, and in one episode of the original 1969 series of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased).

In 2006, Bastedo was reunited for the first time with her co-stars from &quot;The Champions&quot; to provide commentaries and an interview for a DVD release of the show. Still working as an actress, she appeared in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, and touring theatres in 2006 with a production of &quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt&quot; alongside Leslie Grantham and Simon Ward. In 2008, she joined the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, playing Cynthia. In January 2008, she appeared as co-presenter (with Ed Stewart) of &quot;The Magic of Mantovani&quot; at Lighthouse, Poole. The success of this concert led, the following year, to a second concert at the same venue, with the Mantovani Orchestra, which she again co-presented.

==Personal life==
Bastedo dated David Frost and Omar Sharif, but turned down the advances of Steve McQueen who, she recalled, propositioned her with the line, &quot;My wife doesn&#x27;t understand me&quot;. In the case of Sharif, the liaison lasted only a few weeks because of the actor&#x27;s bridge-playing, his odd hours and the fact that he took telephone numbers from other women.

Mike Tomkies, the Fleet Street journalist who abandoned the life of a celebrity reporter to live alone in the wilderness, lived with her for a while in Canada, and they talked of marriage, but she was prohibited from marrying by a contract for &quot;The Champions&quot; (1968 to 69). He said that she was the &quot;most stunningly beautiful creature&quot; he had ever seen.

In 1980, at Chichester Cathedral, Bastedo married Patrick Garland, a director, writer and actor; he became a long-serving director of the Chichester Festival Theatre. Bastedo wrote a memoir, &quot;Beware Dobermanns, Donkeys and Ducks&quot;, as well as several books on caring for cats and dogs. Her husband died on 19 April 2013.

===Animal welfare===
Bastedo was a vegetarian and the founder of Alexandra Bastedo Champions (ABC) Animal Sanctuary. In an interview for the BBC television series &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; Bastedo provided a glimpse into her private life. She used to be the president of her local RSPCA branch but gave up her position in 2008, to dedicate more time to her fast-growing animal sanctuary at her home in West Chiltington, West Sussex. A journalist who interviewed her husband in 2010 described their domestic surroundings:

She was also a patron to a number of animal welfare organisations including Compassion in World Farming, Wildlife Aid Foundation, National Animal Welfare Trust, Greyhounds in Need and Naturewatch.

==Death==
Bastedo died of breast cancer on 12 January 2014, aged 67, in a hospital in Worthing, England. She was buried next to her husband, Patrick Garland in St Mary&#x27;s Church Yard, Sullington, West Sussex. The service was conducted by her local vicar and friend, Revd Derek Spencer.

<text>Television presentation refers to the way in which television stations present themselves between programs.

It has become increasingly important in the recent multichannel television environment for television stations to create an attractive and distinct on-air appearance, through the various elements that form the &#x27;television presentation&#x27; umbrella. These include idents, the short clips that are often shown before a program on many stations. They often consist of an animated form of the station&#x27;s logo, and many have a continuity announcer who speaks over the clip with information about programs on the station. Some stations, such as BBC One in the UK have used live action idents since 1997. This approach however is less common. Other elements include digital on-screen graphics (DOGs) and End Credit Promotions (ECPs). Computerised graphics have been popular since BBC Two introduced the world&#x27;s first computer-generated television identification in the summer of 1979. Less than three months later, American broadcaster NBC introduced their first computerised graphics.

There have been several examples of television presentation choices less popular with viewers. In 2002, the new controller of BBC One, Lorraine Heggessey, deemed the package which had been in place since 1997 too &quot;slow and distant&quot;. The old package consisted of a hot air balloon with an image of the earth printed on it flying over various landmarks across the UK. The package was unique and certainly popular with viewers. Again, it was a rare example of ordinary people recognising and identifying with a channel&#x27;s on-air look. Heggessey instead wanted to introduce a set of idents showing people of various cultural backgrounds dancing in different ways.

The style was ridiculed by many, including the BBC&#x27;s own animated satire Monkey Dust, whose spoofs of the idents included two men engaging in anal sex, and Channel 4&#x27;s digital channel E4, who spoofed it in a set of their own idents and it also was identified by the public for the wrong reasons.

In the United States, cable channel MTV changes its presentation every few months. However, since its inception, the logo (the letter &quot;M&quot; with &quot;tv&quot; on the lower right side) has always remained the same.

In Japan, the state&#x27;s public broadcaster NHK has set up an institute, the NHK Broadcasting Culture Research Institute, to preserve historical TV and radio presentations within the country, as well as researches of Japanese broadcasting presentations throughout the years.

<text>Howard Saunders (16 September 1835 – 20 October 1907) was a British businessman, who later in life became a noted ornithologist, specialising in gulls and terns.

== Life and work ==
Saunders was born in London on 16 September 1835. He received his early education at Leatherhead and Rottingdean. He entered business as a merchant banker, which allowed him to travel widely. From 1855 to 1862 he travelled in Brazil and Chile.

After 1862 Saunders devoted himself to the study of the birds of Spain. He published several articles on the subject in &quot;The Ibis&quot;, having visited the Pyrenees in 1883 and 1884. He also published articles on the birds of Switzerland in 1891, and an account of &quot;The Distribution of Birds in France&quot; in 1893. He was the co-editor with P. L. Sclater for &quot;The Ibis&quot; in 1883–1886 and 1895–1900.

Saunders was an expert on gulls and terns. Among other duties, he wrote about the gull specimens from the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876.

Saunders served as secretary of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union from 1901 to 1907, and first secretary and treasurer of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club. He was also an active member of the Zoological, Linnean and Royal Geographical Societies.

== Ornithological publications ==
In 1869 his first article on the birds of Spain was published in &quot;The Ibis&quot;.

In 1872 he described a new species of green woodpecker, the Iberian green woodpecker, that inhibits the Iberian Peninsula. He called it &quot;Gecinus sharpii&quot; (now &quot;Picus sharpii&quot;), after the name of its discoverer, Richard Bowdler Sharpe (1847-1909).

In 1889 the first edition of the &quot;Illustrated Manual of British Birds&quot; was published. It was issued in twenty parts in 1888 and 1889. In &quot;The Zoologist&quot; of 1888 appeared a &#x27;notice&#x27; about parts i-iv.

Ten years later a second edition appeared. The third edition was published twenty years after the death of Saunders and was revised and enlarged by William Eagle Clarke.

==Legacy==
Two species of birds have been named after him:
* Saunders&#x27;s gull
* Saunders&#x27;s tern

<text>Iris Tree (27 January 1897 – 13 April 1968) was an English poet, actress, and art model, described as a bohemian, an eccentric, a wit, and an adventurer.

==Biography==

Iris Tree&#x27;s parents were actors Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Helen Maud, Lady Tree. Her sisters were actresses Felicity and Viola Tree. An aunt was author Constance Beerbohm, and her uncles were explorer and author Julius Beerbohm and caricaturist and parodist Max Beerbohm.

Iris was sought after as an art model while a young woman, being painted by Augustus John, simultaneously by Duncan Grant, Vanessa Bell, and Roger Fry, and sculpted by Jacob Epstein, showing her bobbed hair (she was said to have cut off the rest and left it on a train) that, along with other behaviour, caused much scandal. The Epstein sculpture is displayed at the Tate Britain. She was often photographed by Man Ray, was friends with Nancy Cunard for a time, and acted alongside Diana Cooper in the mid-1920s.

Iris studied at the Slade School of Art. She contributed verse to the 1917 Sitwell anthology &quot;Wheels&quot;; her published collections were &quot;Poems&quot; (1919), &quot;The Traveller and other Poems&quot; (1927), and &quot;The Marsh Picnic&quot; (1966).

Iris married twice. Her first marriage was to Curtis Moffat, a New York artist; Ivan Moffat, the screenwriter, was their son. She came to America to act in Karl Vollmöller&#x27;s play &quot;The Miracle&quot; in 1925, and there met her second husband, the actor and ex-officer of the Austrian cavalry, Count Friedrich von Ledebur. The two roamed around California with their son before moving back to Europe, where they were involved in the Chekhov Theatre Studio. After their divorce, they both appeared in the 1956 film version of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. She also appeared as a poet, essentially as herself, in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960).

<text>Humberto Fernández-Morán Villalobos (18 February 192417 March 1999) was a Venezuela research scientist born in Maracaibo, Zulia, Venezuela, known for inventing the diamond knife or scalpel, significantly advancing the development of electromagnetic lenses for electron microscopy based on superconducting technology, and many other scientific contributions.

==Career==
Fernández-Morán founded the Venezuelan Institute for Neurological and Brain Studies, the predecessor of the current Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC). He studied medicine at the University of Munich, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1944. He contributed to the development of the electron microscope and was the first person to use the concept of cryo-ultramicrotomy. After flying over Angel Falls in his home country of Venezuela he was inspired by the concept of the smoothly reoccurring flow system inherent in a waterfall to take his diamond knife invention and combine it with an ultramicrotome to dramatically improve the ultra-thin sectioning of electron microscopy samples. The ultramictrotome advances the rotating, drum-mounted specimen sample in such small increments (utilizing the very low thermal expansion coefficient of Invar) past the stationary diamond knife that sectioning thicknesses of several Angstrom units are possible. He also helped to advance the field of electron cryomicroscopy - the use of superconductive electromagnetic lenses cooled with liquid helium in electron microscopes to achieve the highest resolution possible - among many other research topics.

Fernández-Morán was commissioned in 1957 with the supervision of the first Venezuelan research nuclear reactor, the RV-1 nuclear reactor, one of the first in Latin America.

He was appointed Minister of Education during the last year of the regime of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and was forced to leave Venezuela when the dictatorship was overthrown in 1958. He worked with NASA for the Apollo Project and taught in many universities, such as MIT, University of Chicago and the University of Stockholm.

He donated a collection of his papers to the National Library of Medicine in 1986.

==Personal life==
His wife Anna was Swedish and together they had two daughters, Brigida Elena and Verónica.

The body of Humberto Fernández-Morán was cremated and his ashes rest today in Cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath in his hometown, Maracaibo.

<doc id="1061827" wikidata="Q11856075" url="?curid=1061827" title="Diana Cooper (artist)">
<text>Diana Cooper (born 1964) is an American visual artist, known for largely abstract, improvised hybrid constructions that combine drawing, painting, sculpture, installation and photography. Her art has evolved from canvas works centered on proliferating doodles to sprawling installations of multiplying elements and architectonic structures. Critics have described her earlier work—primarily made with craft supplies such as markers, pens, foamcore, pushpins, felt, pipe cleaners, tape and pompoms—as humble-looking yet labor-intensive, provisional and precarious, and &quot;a high-wire act attempting to balance order and pandemonium.&quot; They note parallels to earlier abstract women artists such as Eva Hesse, Lee Bontecou, Elizabeth Murray, and Yayoi Kusama. Lilly Wei, however, identifies an &quot;absurdist playfulness and Orwellian intimations&quot; in Cooper&#x27;s work that occupy a unique place in contemporary abstraction.

Cooper has received the Rome Prize, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and awards from the Anonymous Was A Woman, Pollock-Krasner and Joan Mitchell foundations. She has been commissioned to create public artworks for New York City and the Moss Arts Center at Virginia Tech, and her work has been acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the British Museum and the Pinakothek der Moderne (Munich). Cooper is based in Brooklyn, New York and is married to the scholar and essayist Mark Lilla.

==Early life and career==
Cooper was born in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1964 to Ian and Faith Cooper, who were both artists and teachers at private schools. She was drawn to dance and choreography in her youth, but turned to the visual arts while majoring in history and literature at Harvard University (BA, 1986). After graduating, she took courses at the New York Studio School, before earning an MFA in painting from Hunter College in 1997.

Cooper began exhibiting doodle-based works on canvas in the latter 1990s. She appeared in group shows at the New Museum and Knitting Factory and gained early notice for solo exhibitions at Ah! Space Gallery (1997) and Postmasters Gallery (1998) in New York. Since then, she has continued to exhibit at Postmasters, and in 2007 received a ten-year retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland in 2007. She has also appeared in exhibitions at the Whitney Museum at Altria, MoMA PS1, The Drawing Room (London), SculptureCenter, Contemporary Arts Center (Cincinnati), Sharjah Art Museum (United Arab Emirates), and He Xiangning Art Museum (China), among others. Since 2008, Cooper has been an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University&#x27;s School of the Arts.

==Work and reception==
Cooper is known for her ability to extend two-dimensional sensibilities and geometries into three dimensional &quot;hybrid constructions&quot; and installations. She often relies on reduced color—keying works to one or two primary hues—and simple shapes as basic units, translating thoughts, experiences, emotions and information into abstract visual language. Her use of line, grid and form has been linked to artists such as Mondrian, the Constructivists, minimalists Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt and Tony Smith, and Peter Halley, but is more directly connected to accumulative artists such as Judy Pfaff, Jessica Stockholder and Sarah Sze. Critic David Cohen has distinguished her from the latter group, identifying a &quot;divided sensibility&quot; that maintains both a handmade, casually obsessive mode and a systematizing one committed to taxonomies of form and function. He wrote that all of her work—regardless of format or scale—remains in the orbit of drawing, poised between doodle and collage and operating &quot;as a way of being in the world.&quot;

===Canvases and wall reliefs===
By the mid-1990s, Cooper abandoned painting in favor of a more personal form of expression involving expansive, Sharpie-marker doodles on canvas stapled to walls. In these works, tiny lines and circles (generally red, yellow, blue or black) accumulated to form dense networks, grids and mazes. &quot;The Black One&quot; (1997) is a representative work—a monochromatic canvas covered in black doodles, its surface embellished with metastasizing protrusions of pipe-cleaner chutes and ladders, pockets of pompoms, tape and construction netting. Reviews noted these labyrinthine designs for their graphic skill, sense of improvisation, and play of organic (cells), informational (maps, architectural plans) and technological (electrical circuitry, computer chips, bar codes, pixels) allusions. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Ken Johnson wrote, &quot;Cooper&#x27;s additive process is not uncontrolled. Out of the tension between structures of order and containment and impulses of transgression and expansion, grows a ramshackle architecture or a kind of schematic model of the mind at play.&quot;

In later works, Cooper explored more varied and elaborate formats whose elements spilled off canvases onto walls and floors. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Christopher Knight situated these wall reliefs (e.g., &quot;My Eye Travels&quot;, 2005) between self-contained drawings and &quot;environmental deluge,&quot; likening them to visualizations of the ways computer viruses might work: &quot;Havoc occurs through precise channels of organization, manic energy merges with exacting control and data seem to wobble between ferocious and benign. The structure of her art is a hybrid of machine regularity and human caprice.&quot;

===Installations and sculptural works===
In the 2000s, Cooper expanded her practice to include furniture-like sculptures and full installations that increasingly colonized their exhibition spaces. &quot;Speedway&quot; (2000–3) was a freestanding, De Stijl-styled foamcore structure, consisting on one side of a cutaway that Nancy Princenthal described as &quot;a Las Vegas marquee of pulsing concentric and parallel lines, punctuated by seedily alluring little niches,&quot; and on the other, a dollhouse-like grid of cubbyholes, suggesting a Mondrian/Donald Judd-influenced &quot;mini-museum.&quot; The mutating, increasingly elaborate installation &quot;Orange Alert UK&quot; (2003–8) employed taut linear arrangements of vivid reds, oranges and yellows, initially inspired by the color-coded, post-9/11 terrorist alert system, which formed cardiograph-like wall patterns and radiated from a central, spider-like form.

===Photo-derived work===
Digital photography and themes involving the built environment play a greater role in Cooper&#x27;s later work, which has employed fewer elements and sometimes taken on a frieze-like appearance (e.g., the illusionistic wall-piece, &quot;Undercover&quot;, 2010–3). She uses photography to create sketchbook-like collections of abstract forms taken from everyday experience—details of airport tarmacs, subway seats, grass, refuse, construction fencing, or gallery architecture—which she re-presents out of context, revealing neglected qualities of beauty and strangeness or to create hyperreal spatial illusions (e.g., &quot;Skylight I&quot;, 2012–3). Jerry Saltz described her 2013 show, &quot;My Eye Travels,&quot; as &quot;a florid blaze of color, pattern, abstraction, and images of bits of the world,&quot; composed almost entirely of photographs &quot;assembled into fragmenting mandalas of contemporary energy.&quot;

Several later exhibitions feature more self-contained pieces, sometimes working in relation to one another. The installation &quot;The Wall&quot; (2018) presented several dozen, disparate smaller works hung salon-style, which together functioned like a diaristic, graphic index of Cooper&#x27;s concerns. &quot;Sightings&quot; (2019) consisted of more autonomous works and closed compositions that referenced and framed distinct, bound systems of urban structure, electronics and technology in order to encourage new ways of seeing (e.g., &quot;Slide Rule&quot; or &quot;Family Safe&quot;).

===Public art commissions===
Cooper has received three public art commissions. Her first was the permanent, site-specific work, &quot;Out of the Corner of My Eye&quot; (2008–9, commissioned by NYC Cultural Affairs Percent for Art) for the Jerome Parker Campus in Staten Island. Situated along a slow-curving, 107-foot-long wall in an Ennead Architects-designed building, the work employed more durable materials than past work—glass (inserted into pre-existing windows), fiberboard, metal hardware, and acrylic paint—and received an Americans for the Arts public art award.

For &quot;HighWire&quot; (2016, Moss Arts Center), Cooper developed her concept and imagery digitally, combining scans of her drawings with data visualization imagery alluding to micro- and macro- organic and technological systems. She printed the scans on PhotoTex—a repositionable adhesive material similar to that used in commercial signage—then hand-painted over them, reimagining the data as a lyrical, six-walled, 17-foot-tall, 116-foot-long landscape. In 2023, MTA Arts and Design unveiled Cooper&#x27;s commissioned permanent public mural, &quot;Double Take&quot;, an 8-by-96-foot, glass mosaic, ceramic, granite and aluminum work located on Roosevelt Island. Her design marries geometric forms found in the location&#x27;s ventilation building, the Queensboro Bridge and other surrounding structures with fluid hand-drawn and organic forms reflecting the natural setting and backdrop of the East River.

==Awards and public collections==
Cooper has been recognized with a Guggenheim Fellowship (2000), an American Academy in Rome Prize (2003–4), and awards from Anonymous Was A Woman (2013), the Pollock-Krasner Foundation (2018, 2013, 2008), Joan Mitchell Foundation (2013), New York Foundation for the Arts (2013, 2000), Bogliasco Foundation (2011), and Marie Walsh Sharpe Foundation Space Program (2004–5). She has received artist residencies from the Atlantic Center for the Arts, Institute for Electronic Arts, La Cite Internationales des Arts (Paris), and Virginia Tech.

Her work belongs to the collections of public institutions including the British Museum, Cleveland Clinic, Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Katzen Arts Center, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, New York Public Library, Pinakothek der Moderne and Progressive Art Collection, among others.

<doc id="1061828" wikidata="Q3047206" url="?curid=1061828" title="The Rosie O'Donnell Show">
<text>The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show is an American daytime variety television talk show created, hosted, and produced by actress and comedian Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. It premiered on June 10, 1996, and concluded after six seasons on June 27, 2002.

This talk show was taped in Studio 8G at NBC&#x27;s Rockefeller Center studios in New York City, New York, and was produced and distributed by KidRo Productions, Telepictures Productions, and Warner Bros. Television. The talk show won five Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Talk Show.

==History==

===Debut===
On June 10, 1996, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; premiered, and proved successful. It was a replacement for &quot;Carnie!&quot;, which aired from September 6, 1995, to February 23, 1996. Warner Bros Domestic Television Distribution prematurely concluded &quot;Carnie!&quot; so that &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; could premiere in advance of the fall schedule.

===1996–1999===
In October 1996, a fire broke out at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York City. As a result, the show resumed taping for four days in the Ed Sullivan Theater (where David Letterman taped his show). The first episode resuming taping in the regular studio featured a beginning scene reminiscent of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in which Rosie awakens from a dream.

O&#x27;Donnell often spoke of her admiration for Barbra Streisand, and in November 1997, Streisand (who rarely grants interviews) agreed to a full hour special. The set was covered in flowers and Streisand memorabilia. Streisand&#x27;s husband, actor James Brolin, was also interviewed. Before this interview, O&#x27;Donnell received a brief letter from Streisand which she discussed on-air and held up very briefly. She described Streisand as being very caring in the letter, but would not read it on-air. It was too late, however, as a television camera caught a brief shot of the letter, and within days, savvy viewers distributed its contents. O&#x27;Donnell later expressed dismay that viewers would do that. Streisand was interviewed again in 1999 at her home, shortly before her Timeless tour.

On May 19, 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, which prompted O&#x27;Donnell to become an outspoken supporter of gun control and a major figure in the Million Mom March, O&#x27;Donnell interviewed actor Tom Selleck, who was promoting a film &quot;The Love Letter&quot;. After a commercial break, O&#x27;Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the NRA and challenged him about the NRA&#x27;s position on the use of assault rifles. According to Selleck, the two had agreed not to discuss the topic before his appearance on the show. O&#x27;Donnell maintains that Selleck and his publicist had been informed that the topic would be discussed. She stated at the end of the interview that it had not gone the way she had hoped it would have gone, but went on to say: &quot;I would like to thank you for appearing anyway, knowing that we have differing views. I was happy that you decided to come on the show. And if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize, because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today.&quot;

===2000–2002===
In April 2001, Rosie had a two-week absence from her show because of a staph infection. She had guest hosts take her place, including Joy Behar, Meredith Vieira, Barbara Walters, Kathy Griffin, Marie Osmond, Jane Krakowski, Ana Gasteyer and Caroline Rhea.

On the September 10, 2001 episode, Maxwell Jacob Friedman appeared on the show as a five year child to sing &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; after his parents submitted a tape of him singing it in an operatic style while eating a pear. After a video of his performance resurfaced in 2019, Friedman (in-character) denied the appearance before admitting it, stating that Rosie O&#x27;Donnell was trying to cling onto her fading star and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t have the nerve&quot; to tell Britney Spears (who appeared on the same episode) that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t going to make it as a singer&quot;. During his interview, when asked about what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said he would be an opera singer and a wrestler, and stated that Bill Goldberg and The Rock were his favorite wrestlers at the time.

Throughout the final season O&#x27;Donnell called on Caroline Rhea to host the program every Friday. Rhea&#x27;s growing popularity as a guest host gave her the green light to host her own daytime talk show the following year, supposedly succeeding O&#x27;Donnell. However, Rhea&#x27;s program lasted for only one season.

===Ending===
After a six-year run, the show ended in 2002 when O’Donnell chose to leave to spend more time with her children.

The final live episode aired on May 22, 2002. It featured an opening musical ensemble number from Broadway, starring Vanessa Williams and John Lithgow (who were both appearing on Broadway at the time). The guests were Nathan Lane and Christine Ebersole. The show&#x27;s final segment featured a retrospective video made by Rosie that blended scenes from her personal life with her talk show, accompanied by the song &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; sung by Joni Mitchell. The conclusion of the show featured a clip of Tom Cruise mowing a lawn, who then stops to look at the camera and says, &quot;Rosie, I cut your grass, and here is your lemonade.&quot; (A reference to one of the show&#x27;s running gags, O&#x27;Donnell declaring her adoration of Tom Cruise.)

Remaining new, but pre-taped, episodes continued to air until June 27, 2002, the last with guest host Caroline Rhea. Repeats aired until August 30, 2002, the last of which was a repeat of the broadcast from May 20, 2002.

===Charity fundraiser===
The show was revived for one night only March 22, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an all-star lineup of guests raising money for the Actors Fund of America. The special episode was live streamed on the Broadway.com YouTube channel.

==Format==
Topics often discussed on the show include Broadway, children, extended families and charitable works, people and organizations.

The program was also known for featuring extended production numbers from Broadway shows which were often seen as too time-consuming on other shows. O&#x27;Donnell was known for keeping a light-hearted nature during the show as she playfully interviewed her guests and interacted with her audience. Commonly, O&#x27;Donnell would throw Koosh balls into the audience throughout the show; this gag expanded through the years to include automated Koosh-projecting devices in the ceiling, as well as O&#x27;Donnell firing at a moving target.

The house band was led by pianist John McDaniel, and was dubbed &quot;The McDLTs&quot;.

Unique introductions by a member of the audience were made at the beginning of each episode. (Hi! I&#x27;m [insert audience member], from [insert resident&#x27;s address] and this is &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;. On today&#x27;s show: [insert guests and/or topics]. Hit it, John!). After the animated intro, the audience member would then say, &quot;And now, here&#x27;s Rosie!&quot; as O&#x27;Donnell made her entrance through the curtain. O&#x27;Donnell commented on the DVD release of first season highlights that producers were not keen on this opening but Rosie insisted upon it as she enjoyed being able to talk to a &quot;real person&quot; every show.

===&quot;Kids Are Punny&quot;===
A long-running segment of the show involved telling jokes that children from around the United States mailed into the studio. These jokes were eventually compiled into two books (and eventually a TV special) entitled &quot;Kids Are Punny&quot;; proceeds from the book went to children&#x27;s charity programs.

===Product endorsements===
O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s endorsement of the Tickle Me Elmo played a large part in the huge popularity of the toy. Likewise when she served Drake&#x27;s snack cakes to audience members on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, which helped contribute to increased sales of Drake&#x27;s cakes.

In February 1997, the mouthwash brand Scope released a list of the &quot;least kissable celebrities,&quot; to which O&#x27;Donnell was ranked number one. O&#x27;Donnell responded by promoting rival mouthwash brand Listerine on her show. Listerine thanked O&#x27;Donnell by donating $1000 to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s charity For All Kids every time a guest greeted O&#x27;Donnell with a kiss. Listerine donated more than $150,000.

==Reception==

Early on, O&#x27;Donnell was dubbed &quot;The Queen of Nice&quot; by Newsweek magazine for her sweet personality, which was in stark contrast to many other talk shows of the era.

===Awards and nominations===
The show won multiple Emmys such as five times Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show (1998-2002) during its run.

==Home media==
A compilation of highlights of the show&#x27;s first season was available for sale in September 2008, exclusively from the Home Shopping Network. The DVD runs 90 minutes and contains Rosie O&#x27;Donnell commenting while watching clips of archived footage. Included are Tom Cruise&#x27;s first visit, Fran Drescher&#x27;s parents reviewing Florida restaurants, and the incident in which Donny Osmond made a fat joke at Rosie&#x27;s expense.

In 2021, O&#x27;Donnell began making interviews from the show available on her personal YouTube channel until November 19, 2024 when the channel was terminated due to copyright issues.

<doc id="1061831" wikidata="Q603317" url="?curid=1061831" title="Bill Irwin">
<text>William Mills Irwin (born April 11, 1950) is an American actor, choreographer, clown, and comedian. He began as a vaudeville-style stage performer and has been noted for his contribution to the renaissance of American circus during the 1970s. He has made a number of appearances on film and television, and he won a Tony Award for his role in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; He also worked as a choreographer on Broadway and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Choreography in 1989 for &quot;Largely New York&quot;. He is also known as Mr. Noodle on the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; segment &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, and he appeared in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; film short &quot;Does Air Move Things?&quot; He has regularly appeared as Dr. Peter Lindstrom on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and had a recurring role as &quot;The Dick &amp; Jane Killer&quot; on &quot;&quot;. From 2017 to 2019, he appeared as Cary Loudermilk on the FX television series &quot;Legion&quot;.

==Early life==
Irwin was born in Santa Monica, California, to Elizabeth (née Mills), a teacher, and Horace G. Irwin, an aerospace engineer. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1974 and attended Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College the following year. In 1975, he helped found the Pickle Family Circus in San Francisco, California. He credits his experience with the circus, and performing in schools under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, as having made him a working artist. In 1979, Irwin left the company to pursue stage work.

==Career==

===Creator and writer===
Irwin has created several highly regarded stage shows that incorporate elements of clowning, often in collaboration with composer Doug Skinner. These works included &quot;The Regard of Flight&quot; (1982), which ran on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in April 1987 for 17 performances, &quot;Largely New York&quot; (1989), &quot;Fool Moon&quot; (1993), &quot;The Harlequin Studies&quot; (2003), and &quot;Mr. Fox: A Rumination&quot; (2004). &quot;Mr. Fox&quot; is a production that Irwin has worked on for years, a biography of 19th century clown George Washington Lafayette Fox that also has autobiographical elements. In 2013, he teamed with his occasional partner David Shiner to create and perform in the Off-Broadway &quot;clowning revue-with-music&quot; &quot;Old Hats&quot; along with actress and musician Nellie McKay. &quot;Old Hats&quot; won the 2013 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue. &quot;Old Hats&quot; was revived in New York City in 2016, with Shiner and Irwin returning and a new third performer, musician Shaina Taub, performing with her band between the sketches. 

He adapted Molière&#x27;s play &quot;Les Fourberies de Scapin&quot; as a comedy called &quot;Scapin&quot;, and has played the title role in several productions. He appeared in the play at the off-Broadway Roundabout Theatre Company Laura Pels Theatre in January through March 1997, after performing in the play at the Seattle Rep. His adaptation allowed him to incorporate his signature clowning routines into the course of the action.

Irwin performed with The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps at the 1996 Summer Olympics, in a &quot;band on the run&quot; sequence where he played Dr. Hubert Peterson of the fictitious Federation of United Marching Associations of America.

===Actor===

Although Irwin is best known for his theatrical clown work, he has also been featured in a number of dramatic plays. Irwin appeared with Steve Martin and Robin Williams in the Lincoln Center Off-Broadway production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, in 1988, in the role of Lucky. Lucky&#x27;s only lines consist of a famous 500-word-long monolog, an ironic element for Irwin since much of his clown-based stage work was silent.

He directed the 1998 Roundabout Theatre Company production of &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot;. He appeared in 2002 with Sally Field in the replacement cast of &quot;The Goat or Who is Sylvia?&quot; In 2005, he starred as George alongside Kathleen Turner in a revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, for which he won a Tony Award. He played Vladimir (Didi) in the 2009 Broadway revival of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, and Mr. McAfee in the Broadway revival of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. In 2011, he appeared in &quot;King Lear&quot; at the Public Theatre. In 2023, he played Clov in the Irish Repertory Theatre&#x27;s Off-Broadway production of &quot;Endgame&quot;.

===Film and television===
Irwin&#x27;s first featured film role was in 1980, appearing as Harold Hamgravy in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot; starring Robin Williams.

<text>Sterzing (; ) is a comune in South Tyrol in northern Italy. It is the main town of the southern Wipptal, and the Eisack River flows through the medieval town. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==History==
===Origin===
The town traces its roots to 14 B.C., when Nero Claudius Drusus founded a military camp called &quot;Vipitenum&quot; along the road between what are now Italy and Germany. Ancient ruins found nearby include a sepulchral monument dedicated to Postumia Vittorina, a milestone of the Imperator Septimius Severus period and a stone altar dedicated to Lord Mithras. The first mention of a town called &quot;Wibitina&quot; dates back to the years between 985 and 990. That name, which is still memorized in Wipptal, is traced back to the nearby Celto-Roman settlement Vibidina.

In 1182, the German name &quot;Sterçengum&quot; appears in a document of the Sonnenburg abbey.

In 1280, Duke Meinhard of Carinthia, promoted the town to the rank of city. As the region&#x27;s proximity to the Brenner Pass made it a frequent trade route, the Fugger of Augsburg opened a branch to sort the products of the nearby silver mines in Ridnaun Valley and Pfleres Valley. Sterzing knew its magnificence in the 15th and 16th centuries after the 1443 fire which destroyed part of the town. New embattled houses were built, some late gothic style, in Neustadt (New Town) as: Town and Regional Trial House (1450), Hotel &quot;Goldenes Kreuz&quot; (1446), Fugger&#x27;s Branch (1553), Rafenstein House (former Köchl, 1472), the Town Hall (1473), Geizkofler House (1600) and the Mining District House (1500) all still in use.

The town is mentioned in several sources from the 16th to 19th centuries as &quot;Störzingen&quot;. In the course of the Italianization of South Tyrol, the modern Italian name of the town &quot;Vipiteno&quot; - created from the old Roman settlement of &quot;Vipitenum&quot; - was made official. Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, a number of wanted Nazis stayed in Sterzing at the Hotel Goldenes Kreuz which still exists today. At different times, people like Erich Priebke, Adolf Eichmann, and Josef Mengele were in transit here as they waited for forged passports for their journey out of Europe and by ship to South America.

===Coat of arms===
King Henry I, Count of Tyrol, granted a seal, similar to the present, depicting a crippled pilgrim with a stick and the rosary above the Tyrolean eagle, this appeared as a coat of arms August 30, 1328. In 1524, the pilgrim is shown as a monk above the Tyrolean eagle. 
==Main sights==

====Parish of &quot;Our Lady of Marsh&quot;====
The Parish is the biggest church between Verona and Munich and was built from 1417 to 1451. The gothic altar, woodwork by Hans Multscher of Ulm, is high and was completed in 1458. The church was later enlarged from 1497 to 1525 by Hans Lutz. In 1753, the church was then modified in baroque style, with paintings by Adam Mölk, and the gothic altar removed; presently the altar is on display at the Multscher Museum.

The altarpieces presumably were painted by Josef Renzler in 1800 circa and represent Saint Mary Magdalene with Saint Francis and Saint Anthony; on the lateral altars are depicted Saint Felix and Saint Anthony of Padua.

====Saint Margaret Church====
The present church was built on the initiative of Bishop Paulinus Mayr in early Tyrolean baroque on a project of Peter Delai in 1678. The old church, mentioned for the first time in 1337, was restored and enlarged between 1459 and 1463 in gothic. In 1678, it was completely demolished, rebuilt, and consecrated in 1681. The bell tower is detached from the church and it comes from the previous church, in 1624, the Romanic tower was demolished and built the present. The façade was inspired by to renaissance with the characteristic Palladian tripartite windows. In the niches are placed the wooden sculptures of Saint Margaret and Saint Agnes and above the portal is a fresco showing the Last Supper. The imposing interior has one nave, large windows, and a vaulted ceiling with lunettes. The great high altar has six columns and an altarpiece representing the Coronation of Mary painted by Joseph Renzler in 1822, beside are two wood-carving of the Saints Francis Xavier and John of Nepomuk.
