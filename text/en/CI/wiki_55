<text>As the seat of the Papacy, the Vatican City and its predecessor, the Papal States, has played an important role in the development of Christian music. They perform chants of ancient origin, such as Gregorian chants, as well as modern polyphonic music. The papal choir is a well-known institution that dates back more than four hundred years. Singers were originally from northern Europe, but began arriving more from Spain and Italy in the 16th century. At this time, church authorities became concerned about the words of liturgical texts being drowned out by the traditional melodies. As a result, reformers like Giovanni Palestrina revised the rules behind Gregorian chanting and Germanium, which were printed by the Medici Press in Rome; these reforms continued to be followed to the present day. A traditional musical instrument was the pipe organ.

After the end of the Papal States, the Popes&#x27; ability to sponsor composers and musicians waned. However, it did not end entirely nor did interest in the subject. Pope Pius X and Pope Pius XII both wrote on the subject. In modern times, John Harbison and Gilbert Levine have composed or conducted for the Vatican.

Although not of the Vatican, a Christmas concert where popular musicians performed had been held at the Vatican for thirteen years until ending in 2006. Notable performers at it included José Feliciano, Thelma Houston, Dionne Warwick, Gloria Gaynor, and B. B. King. The concert created controversy in 2003 due to statements by Lauryn Hill who used the opportunity to criticize the Vatican over Roman Catholic sex abuse cases.

<text>German [[fortresses]] ( or , ; called pockets by the Allies) during World War II were bridgeheads, cities, islands and towns designated by Adolf Hitler as areas that were to be fortified and stocked with food and ammunition in order to hold out against Allied offensives. 

The fortress doctrine evolved towards the end of World War II, when the German leadership had not yet accepted defeat, but had begun to realize that drastic measures were required to forestall inevitable offensives on the &quot;Reich&quot;. The first such stronghold was Stalingrad.
==Fortresses==
===Eastern Front fortresses===

On the Eastern Front, Warsaw, Budapest, Kolberg, Königsberg, Küstrin, Danzig and Breslau were some of the large cities selected as strongholds.

===Western Front fortresses===

On the Western Front, Hitler declared eleven major ports as fortresses on 19 January 1944: IJmuiden, the Hook of Holland, Dunkirk, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Le Havre, Cherbourg, Saint-Malo, Brest, Lorient, Saint-Nazaire and the Gironde estuary. In February and March 1944 three more coastal areas were declared to be fortresses: the Channel Islands, Calais and La Rochelle.

==Fate of the fortresses==

The fate of the fortress areas varied. Stalingrad, the first to fall, is seen as a crucial turning point in the war, and one of the key battles which led to German defeat. In several cases, Alderney, for example, the fortresses were bypassed by the attackers and did not fall, surrendering only after the unconditional surrender of Germany. One fortress, Fortress Courland, would see guerrilla war being waged in the area from 1945 to 1960s by Lithuanian partisans and a few Germans who fought as Forest Brothers, with individual guerrillas remaining in hiding and evaded capture into the 1980s.

<doc id="1062220" wikidata="Q1986689" url="?curid=1062220" title="Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton">
<text>Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, KG ( ; 10 March 1607 – 16 May 1667), styled Lord Wriothesley before 1624, was an English statesman, a staunch supporter of King Charles II who after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 rose to the position of Lord High Treasurer, which term began with the assumption of power by the Clarendon Ministry. He &quot;was remarkable for his freedom from any taint of corruption and for his efforts in the interests of economy and financial order&quot;, a noble if not a completely objective view of his work as the keeper of the nation&#x27;s finances. He died before the impeachment of Lord Clarendon, after which the Cabal Ministry took over government.

==Origins==
He was the only surviving son of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (1573–1624) by his wife Elizabeth Vernon (1572–1655), a daughter of John Vernon (died 1592) of Hodnet, Shropshire. In 1545 King Henry VIII granted to his ancestor Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, Chancellor of England, the manor of Bloomsbury (now in Central London), which descended by the 4th Earl&#x27;s second daughter and heiress to the Russell family, and is now part of the Bedford Estate. The Wriothesley family is commemorated today by Southampton Row and Southampton Street in Holborn, within the historic estate.

==Career==
He was educated at Eton College and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

He succeeded to the earldom following deaths of both his father and his older brother James in the Netherlands in December 1624. At first, he sided with the Parliament supporters upon the controversies leading to the English Civil War, but upon his realisation of their propensity to violence, he became a loyal supporter of King Charles I. While remaining very loyal to the deposed monarch, he still worked for peace and represented the king at the peace conferences in 1643 and one at Uxbridge in 1645. He was allowed to remain in England, having paid fines to the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents of more than £6,000.

Several months after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Lord Southampton was appointed Lord High Treasurer (8 September 1660), a position he occupied until his death. Samuel Pepys admired Southampton&#x27;s integrity and the stoicism with which he endured his painful last illness, but clearly had doubts about his competence as Treasurer; in particular, he recorded Southampton&#x27;s despairing words to him, having been asked to raise more funds at a Council meeting in April 1665: &quot;Why, what means all this, Mr. Pepys? This is true, you say, but what would you have me do? I have given all I can for my life. Why will not people lend their money?&quot; However Pepys admitted that Sir William Coventry, the colleague he most admired, was himself an admirer of Southampton, whom he described as &quot;a great statesman&quot;. Coventry recalled that other ministers would joke that regardless of his complaints that it was &quot;impossible&quot; to find money, Southampton always succeeded in the end. Southampton however once grimly remarked that &quot;Impossible will be found impossible at the last&quot;, an accurate prophecy of the crisis of 1672 which led to the Stop of the Exchequer.

==Marriages and issue==

He married thrice and had three daughters:
*Firstly to Rachel de Massue (1603 – 16 February 1640), a French Huguenot and an aunt of Henri de Massue, Marquis de Ruvigny, 1st Viscount Galway. By Rachel he had two daughters and co-heiresses:
**Elizabeth Wriothesley, Viscountess Campden, wife of Edward Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough, 4th Viscount Campden (1641–1689) (created Earl of Gainsborough in 1682)
**Rachel Wriothesley, heiress of Bloomsbury, wife of William Russell, Lord Russell (1639–1683), third son of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford. The eventual heir to all the estates of her father Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, was her only son Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford (1680–1711). 
*Secondly he married Lady Elizabeth Leigh, daughter of Francis Leigh, 1st Earl of Chichester from whom he inherited the title Earl of Chichester. By Elizabeth Leigh he had a further daughter:
**Elizabeth Wriothesley (1646–1690) who married twice, firstly to Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670), whom she bore an only surviving child, heiress to the vast Percy estates, Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667–1722) (Duchess of Somerset) who married Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662–1748). She married secondly Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu.
*Thirdly he married Lady Frances Seymour, a daughter of William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1587–1660) by his second wife Lady Frances Devereux. They had no children.

<text>Escape from Sobibor is a 1987 British television film which aired on ITV and CBS. It is the story of the mass escape from the Nazi extermination camp at Sobibor, the most successful uprising by Jewish prisoners of German extermination camps (uprisings also took place at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka). The film was directed by Jack Gold and shot in Avala, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). The full 176-minute version shown in the UK on 10 May 1987 followed a 143-minute version shown in the United States on 12 April 1987.

The script, by Reginald Rose, was based on Richard Rashke&#x27;s 1983 book of the same name, along with a manuscript by Thomas Blatt, &quot;From the Ashes of Sobibor&quot;, and a book by Stanisław Szmajzner, &quot;Inferno in Sobibor&quot;. Alan Arkin, Joanna Pacuła, and Rutger Hauer starred in the film. The film received a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role—Television Film or Miniseries. (The film tied with &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story&quot;.) Esther Raab was a camp survivor who had assisted Rashke with his book and served as a technical consultant.

==Background==
On 14 October 1943, members of the Sobibor camp&#x27;s underground resistance killed 11 German &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; officers and a number of &quot;Sonderdienst&quot; Ukrainian and &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; guards. Of the 600 inmates in the camp, roughly 300 escaped, although all but 50–70 were later re-captured and killed. After the escape, the SS Chief, Heinrich Himmler, ordered the death camp closed. It was dismantled, bulldozed under the earth and planted over with trees to cover it up.

==Plot==

The film begins with a new trainload of Polish Jews arriving for processing at Sobibor. The German Commandant gives them a welcome speech, assuring the new arrivals that the place is a work camp. Other SS officers move along the assembled lines of prisoners, selecting a small number who have trade skills (such as goldsmiths, seamstresses, shoemakers, and tailors). The remaining prisoners are sent away to a different part of the camp from which a pillar of smoke rises day and night. It is some time before the new prisoners realise that Sobibor is a death camp; all of the other Jews are exterminated in gas chambers, and their corpses are cremated in large ovens. The small number of prisoners kept alive in the other part of the camp are charged with sorting the belongings taken from those who are murdered and then repairing the shoes, recycling the clothing, and melting down any silver or gold to make jewellery for the SS officers. Despite their usefulness, these surviving prisoners&#x27; existence is precarious; beatings and murders can occur at any time.

Gustav Wagner is the most clever and sadistic of the German officers. When two prisoners escape from a work detail in the nearby forest, Wagner forces the remaining thirteen prisoners of the work gang to each select one other prisoner to die with them (under the threat that if they refuse, he will select fifty) and then executes all twenty six.

The leader of the prisoners, Leon Feldhendler, realises that when the trains eventually stop coming, the camp will have outlived its usefulness, and all the remaining Jews will be murdered. He devises a plan for every prisoner to escape, by luring the SS officers and NCOs into the prisoners&#x27; barracks and work huts one by one and killing them as quietly as possible. Once all the Germans are dead, the prisoners will assemble into columns and simply march out of the camp as if they have been ordered to, and it is hoped that the Ukrainian Guards, not knowing what is going on, and with no Germans left alive to give orders or raise the alarm, will not interfere. A new group of prisoners arrives: Red Army prisoners who are Russian Jews. Their leader, Sasha Pechersky and his men willingly join the revolt, their military skills proving invaluable.

The Camp Kommandant leaves for several days, taking Wagner with him, which proves an advantage as the most sadistic of the SS officers will be absent. On 14 October 1943, the plan goes into action. One by one, SS officers and NCOs are lured into traps set by groups of prisoners armed with knives and clubs. Eleven Germans are killed, but one officer, Karl Frenzel, unwittingly evades his killers, discovers the corpse of one of his colleagues, and raises the alarm. By now, the prisoners have assembled on the parade ground and, realising the plan has been discovered, Pechersky and Feldhendler urge the prisoners to revolt and flee the camp. Most of the 600 prisoners run for the perimeter fences, some of the Jews using captured rifles to shoot their way through the Ukrainian guards. Other guards open fire with machine guns from observation towers, cutting many of the fleeing prisoners down, and other escapees are killed on the minefield surrounding the camp, over 300 Jews reach the forest and escape.

As the survivors flee deeper into the forest, famed newscaster Howard K. Smith narrates the fates that befell some of the survivors on whose accounts the film was based. Of the 300 prisoners who escaped, only approximately 50 survived to see the end of the war in 1945. Pechersky makes it back to Soviet lines and rejoins the Red Army, surviving the war, and Feldhendler lives to see the end of the war but is killed shortly afterwards in a clash with anti-semitic Poles. Sergeant Wagner escapes to Brazil, where he is found stabbed to death in 1980. After the uprising, which was the largest escape from a prison camp of any kind in Europe during World War II, Sobibor was bulldozed to the ground, and trees were planted on the site to remove any sign of its existence.

<text>Michele Angiolillo Lombardi (; 5 June 1871 – 20 August 1897) was an Italian anarchist, born in Foggia, Italy. He assassinated Spanish Prime Minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo in 1897 and was captured and executed by Spanish authorities in the same year.

==Motive and the Montjuïc trial==
On 7 June 1896, a bomb was thrown at the Corpus Christi procession in Barcelona. At least twelve people died and 45 were seriously injured. The crime, which was attributed by police to an unidentified anarchist, precipitated an aggressive reprisal against Spanish anarchists, communists, socialists, and republicans, in what became known as the Montjuïc trial: 300 alleged revolutionaries were jailed at Montjuïc Fortress, and confessions were extracted by torture. The prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo himself ordered the repression. Reports of the prisoner abuse were circulated widely in the European press.

Of the 87 prisoners taken to trial at Montjuïc, eight received death sentences; five executions were carried out. Many others were condemned to long imprisonment and the remaining prisoners were deported to Río de Oro (a Spanish colony in what is now the disputed Western Sahara).

Angiolillo, was at the time, working as a printer in the little-known Typographia institution, the section of the British printer&#x27;s union that was reserved for foreigners. On May 30, 1897, Angiolillo, among at least ten thousand other people, attended a demonstration in Trafalgar Square against the brutal repression of worker&#x27;s rights movements within Spain, specifically under Cánovas. Organized by the Spanish Atrocities Committee led by the anarchist Joseph Perry, a wide range of activists spoke to the crowd, including Fernando Tarrida del Mármol and Charles Malato. Malato, in his speech, asked who would avenge the people who had died under the regime of Cánovas.

After the protest, Angiolillo personally met with a man by the last name of Oller and Francisco Gana. Both of these men had terrible wounds, suffered from the torture that was administered on the order of Cánovas. The German anarchist Rudolf Rocker, who was also present, wrote the following about the meeting:

&quot;That night when Gana showed us his crippled limbs, and the scars over his entire body left by the tortures, we understood that it is one thing to read about such matters, but quite another to hear about them from the very lips of the victims&quot; ... &quot;We all sat there as if turned to stone, and it was some minutes before we could utter a few words of indignation. Only Angiolillo said not a word. A little later, he suddenly rose to his feet, uttered a laconic goodbye, and abandoned the house&quot; ... &quot;This was the last time I saw him.&quot;

==The assassination of Cánovas del Castillo==


Under a false identity of a reporter for the Il Popolo newspaper by the name of Emilio Rinaldini, Michele Angiolillo traveled to Spain from London, passing through Paris and Bordeaux. When he reached Madrid, he learned that Cánovas had traveled to the thermal bath resort of Santa Águeda (now a psychiatric hospital) in Mondragón, Guipúzcoa, and decided to pursue him there. On 8 August 1897, Angiolillo found Cánovas alone and shot him dead. The Prime Minister&#x27;s wife hurried to the scene, shouting &quot;Murderer! Murderer!&quot; after the gunman. Angiolillo, in turn, bowed and declared, &quot;Pardon, Madame. I respect you as a lady, but I regret that you were the wife of that man.&quot; The repression and mass torture at Montjuich was a direct factor behind Michele Angiolillo&#x27;s decision to assassinate Cánovas, and he claimed in his defence speech to be &quot;no assassin, but rather an executioner&quot;, calling Cánovas, among other things, the personification of the greed of the bourgeoisie and the tyranny of power.

About Angiolillo, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote:

Angiolillo allowed the authorities to capture him and vehemently denied other parties&#x27; involvement in the assassination. He was executed by garrote in the nearby town of Vergara.

There is some evidence that he originally planned to kill one or two young members of the Spanish royal family, but was dissuaded by Puerto Rican nationalist leader Ramón Emeterio Betances, who suggested Cánovas del Castillo as a target instead. Betances provided logistical assistance for Angiolillo&#x27;s safe travel into Spain, as well as some money.

=== Legacy ===
There is a street named after him in Foggia.

Vicente received a B.A.Sc. in industrial engineering from the University of Toronto in 1985, a M.S. in industrial engineering and operations research from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1987, and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991.

During 1987-1988, he spent a formative year as a visiting scientist in the Section for Informatics and Cognitive Science of the Risø National Laboratory in Roskilde, Denmark. During 1991-92, he was on the faculty of the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Currently, he is Professor of Mechanical &amp; Industrial Engineering, Biomaterials &amp; Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, and founding director of its Cognitive Engineering Laboratory. He is also an adjunct professor of psychology at Miami University, and a registered Professional Engineer in Ontario. During 2002-03, he was Jerome Clarke Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace Information Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Research contributions==
Kim has conducted extensive research on how to design technology that works for people in complex sociotechnical systems, and along with Jens Rasmussen, started a new field of research called Ecological Interface Design which has spawned hundreds of articles by researchers from around the globe. He and his students have applied these ideas to a number of diverse application domains, including: animation, aviation, engineering design, medicine, network management, nuclear power, and petrochemical processes. This research has led to 1 patent, many scholarly contributions (2 books, 3 co-edited books, 91 journal articles, 84 conference proceedings papers, 16 book chapters, 18 invited keynote addresses, and 54 technical reports) as well as significant technology transfer to industry, including the radical organizational restructuring of a multi-billion dollar multinational pharmaceutical corporation toward a more systems-oriented approach to design.

In 1999, Kim authored the first textbook in the area of cognitive work analysis, &quot;Cognitive Work Analysis: Toward Safe, Productive, and Healthy Computer-based Work&quot;, published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. His latest book, &quot;The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology&quot;, was published by Alfred A. Knopf Canada in 2003, Routledge in the US and Les Éditions Logiques in Québec in 2004.

==Media==
Kim was called upon to give an expert opinion to the media on issues related to people and technology. He has been quoted or his work featured in numerous outlets around the world. He has written for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as well as the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. In 1999, he was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of 25 Canadians under the age of 40 who is a &quot;Leader for the 21st Century who will shape Canada&#x27;s future&quot;.

==Lecturing and consulting==
Kim has been invited to lecture in 11 countries on 4 continents, including one lecture tour in Japan and another in Australia. He has acted as a consultant to industry and government, including the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada, Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Honeywell Technology Center, Microsoft, NASA Ames Research Center, NATO, Nortel Networks, US Institute of Medicine, US National Academy of Engineering, and US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

==Honours and awards==
In 1991, Kim received the Brunswik New Investigator Award at the International Invitational Meeting of the Brunswik Society, and the award for the best paper published in the Human Factors Society Bulletin. In 1995, he was a co-recipient of the outstanding abstract award in the area of Clinical Application of Technology from the Society for Technology in Anesthesia. In 1999, he was the recipient of a first-round Premier’s Research Excellence Award, valued at $100,000. Kim was on the Administrative Committee of the IEEE Society for Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, an Associate Editor of the &quot;IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics&quot;, and on the editorial boards of Human Factors and the International Journal of Cognitive Ergonomics. Currently, he serves on the editorial board of Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science. In 2002, he became the first engineering professor ever to receive the $100,000 McLean Award, the University of Toronto’s wealthiest and most prestigious prize for outstanding research. He has also received the Outstanding Professional Achievement Award from the Federation of Portuguese-Canadian Business and Professionals (2003), and the COPA Award for Outstanding Vision/Leadership from the Portuguese Canadian National Congress (2004).

Kim is only the second Canadian researcher to be invited to serve on the Committee for Human Factors of the U.S. National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences. He is also a Senior Fellow and a member of the Corporation of Massey College. In 2003, he received the E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship, Canada’s most prestigious prize for young academics in all areas of science and engineering.

&quot;The Human Factor&quot; received the National Business Book Award and the Science in Society General Audience Book Award, and was a finalist for the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Non-fiction Book of the Year.

<doc id="1062233" wikidata="Q1475554" url="?curid=1062233" title="Sodexo">
<text>Sodexo (formerly Sodexho Alliance) is a French food services and facilities management company headquartered in the Paris suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux. It has 522,000 employees as of 2023, operates in 55 countries and serves 100 million customers on a daily basis. It is Europe’s second largest company of its type by both number of employees and revenue after Compass Group.

For fiscal year 2023 (ending August 2023), revenues reached €28.1 billion with an underlying operating profit of 699 million euro. Market capitalization was 11.5 billion euro as at 26 October 2023.

Sodexo serves many sectors, including private corporations, government agencies, schools from preschool through university (including seminaries and trade schools), hospitals and clinics, assisted-living facilities, military bases, and prisons. As of 2016, subsidiary Sodexo Justice Services operated support services in 122 prisons in eight countries, including 42 in the Netherlands, 34 in France, and others in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Chile, as well as directly running 7 prisons in the UK.

==History==
The company was launched in 1966 by Pierre Bellon (Chairman) in Marseille, France, initially serving company restaurants, schools and hospitals under the name Société d&#x27;Exploitation Hotelière (). Today Sodexo is on the Fortune Global 500 list and the second largest employer among all French multi-national corporations.

Throughout the 1970s, the company expanded in France and internationally; first in Belgium, then Africa, and finally the Middle East. After an initial public offering on the Paris Bourse in 1983, the firm continued its expansion into North America, South America, Japan, South Africa and Russia.

In 1994, on October 31, Sodexo began operations in India. Currently Sodexo India has over 40,135 employees. The head office is situated in Goregaon, Mumbai.

In 1997, Société d&#x27;Exploitation Hotelière&#x27;s holding company changed its name to Sodexho, and joined forces with Universal Ogden Services, the leading remote-site service provider in the U.S.

On 11 January 1995, Sodexo S.A. acquired food company Gardner Merchant Ltd. from Cinven and CVC Capital Partners.

In 1998, Sodexho merged with Marriott Management Services, at the time one of the largest food services companies in North America. Included in the merger was a name change to Sodexho Marriott Services. The merger helped the company become one of the largest food services providers in the United States. In June 2001, Sodexho acquired complete control of Sodexho Marriott Services.

In 2002, Sodexho was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but the company withdrew its listing in 2007. As of 2017, the company is listed on Euronext Paris under the symbol SW and trades stocks over-the-counter under the symbols SDXOF and SDXAY.

In the summer of 2006, the company made a deal with retired NBA Hall of Famer and entrepreneur, Magic Johnson and Magic Food Provisions, a subsidiary of Magic Johnson Enterprises. The initiative includes a marketing agreement and the formation of SodexhoMAGIC, LLC, a new joint venture that is 51 percent owned by Johnson.

In 2007, Sodexho launched its catering arm in United Kingdom schools, using the brand name &quot;For you...&quot;.

In 2008, Sodexho changed its name to Sodexo, dropping the &quot;h&quot; in order to make the name easier to pronounce in many languages worldwide.

In August 2009, Sodexo acquired the in-home care services company, Comfort Keepers. Comfort Keepers provides non-medical, in-home care for adults and seniors. It is an international franchise system with locally owned and operated franchise offices, and is headquartered in Dayton, Ohio. 

The DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity is the leading assessment of diversity management in the US economy and globally. In 2010, Sodexo ranked number one. 

In 2010, Sodexo entered into two new partnerships: the first one with United Coffee, who will supply Sodexo with machines as well as fair-trade certified coffees; the other one with Numi, from which Sodexo has selected 100% organic teas.

In 2011, Sodexo entered an eight-year contract with the US government, by which the company committed itself to provide food services to 51 United States Marine Corps mess halls.

== Leadership ==
In 2005, Michel Landel was appointed Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Pierre Bellon, who continued as Chairman of the Board of Directors.

In January 2016, Lorna C. Donatone was appointed head of Sodexo&#x27;s North American business operations and CEO of its school operations worldwide.

In 2018, Denis Machuel replaced Michel Landel as CEO.

Following the death of Pierre Bellon in 2022, his daughter Sophie Bellon took over the roles of chairwoman of the board of directors and CEO.

In February 2025, Michael Svagdis was named CEO of campus and government services in the US.

==Food services and facilities management==

Sodexo offerings range from food service operations including staff restaurants, catering, executive dining, vending, and meal delivery, to integrated facilities management services that include both soft services (reception, concierge, cleaning, pantry, laundry, groundskeeping, waste management, vendor management, etc.) and hard services (HVAC systems, electrical systems including substations up to 220kV, energy efficiency &amp; sustainability services, plumbing/water treatment plant/sewage treatment plant operation, annual equipment operation &amp; maintenance contracts, project management, etc.).

==Service vouchers and cards==
Payment services in the form of vouchers and cards is provided to Sodexo in part by Freedompay.

==Name change==
The company changed its official name from Sodexho Alliance to simply Sodexo after a shareholder vote at the company&#x27;s annual general meeting on 22 January 2008. The reason for removing the letter &#x27;h&#x27; from Sodexho, cited in the group&#x27;s 2007 annual report, is that &quot;in certain languages an &#x27;x&#x27; followed by an &#x27;h&#x27; is difficult to pronounce&quot;. The company&#x27;s corporate website also states that it draws emphasis away from the hotel services industry they were once associated with, as they now focus on many other directions. The Sod part of the name remains unchanged. The logo of the company was also changed, dropping the five stars to a single star. The bar of the letter &#x27;x&#x27; is also now curved, like a smile, supposedly suggestive of the company&#x27;s claimed desire to constantly seek and increase the satisfaction of their clients.

==Controversy==
In 2009, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) launched a United States nationwide campaign against Sodexo with the stated objective of improving wage and job standards. In 2010, the SEIU recruited students at many U.S. colleges to support strikes and demonstrations in protest of Sodexo&#x27;s alleged unfair labor practices including anti-union behavior and paying low wages. Although one series of strikes at the University of Pittsburgh led to the negotiation of higher wages and lower cost health insurance plans for the cafeteria workers, none of the Sodexo accounts targeted by the SEIU have unionized or requested an election vote. According to a statement from Sodexo, the SEIU engaged in a smear campaign in an effort to drive out rival labor unions that have traditionally operated in the foodservice industry as well as for general publicity.

Sodexo filed a lawsuit in March 2011 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act accusing the SEIU of &quot;engaging in illegal tactics in its effort to unionize workers&quot;. During the trial, it was revealed that the SEIU had written and distributed a manual to its staff detailing how &quot;outside pressure can involve jeopardizing relationships between the employer and lenders, investors, stockholders, customers, clients, patients, tenants, politicians, or others on whom the employer depends for funds.&quot; Tactics recommended include references to blackmail, extortion, accusations of racism and sexism, and targeting the homes and neighborhoods of business leaders for demonstrations. Following the court discovery of this document, the SEIU agreed to terminate their public campaign focused on Sodexo and the charges against SEIU were dropped.

In May 2011, 27 University of Washington students were arrested during a sit-in at the university&#x27;s administrative offices for protesting the university&#x27;s concessions contract with Sodexo. Later that same month, another 13 students were arrested under similar circumstances.

In April 2012, a Sodexo regional manager disrupted a student protest at the State University of New York at New Paltz by tearing up protesters&#x27; signs. Students there had organized a protest to highlight what they saw as the company&#x27;s unethical treatment of workers and its lack of response to issues of sustainability.

On 22 February 2013, all of the frozen beef products used by Sodexo in the UK were withdrawn following the discovery of horse DNA in a sample. The company supplies 2,300 institutions, including schools, senior citizen homes, prisons and branches of the armed forces within the UK.

In August 2013, Sodexo Justice Services was criticised in an official report for subjecting a female prisoner to &quot;cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment&quot;, which &quot;appears to amount to torture&quot; at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, UK. The woman was kept segregated from other prisoners in an &quot;unkempt and squalid&quot; prison cell for more than five years.

In February 2019, Sodexo was criticized by the United Kingdom Ministry of Justice for failing to prevent repeated and systemic breaches of the human rights of inmates at the Sodexo-operated HMP Peterborough. This stemmed from a series of illegal strip-searches of prisoners at the jail in 2017, including one inmate who was menstruating and another who was transitioning from female to male. Justice Julian Knowles described the illegal procedures as &quot;humiliating and embarrassing.&quot;

HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, operated by Sodexo Justice Services, were investigated by police after allowing a woman to give birth alone in her cell without any kind of medical support. The baby was found dead in the early hours of 27 September 2019.

In December 2019, a dispute between the UNITE HERE Local 11 union and the Sodexo operation at Loyola Marymount University threatened to derail a planned Democratic Party presidential candidate debate at the university. The union alleged mistreatment of food service workers.

Starting in October 2019, Sodexo employees (mainly cleaners, porters and caterers) at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London, organised by the UVW union, protested at unfair pay and terms on their contract with the hospital and were asking to be brought in-house as full NHS employees and to be paid the London Living Wage of £10.85/hour. After being told that this wasn&#x27;t possible and after Sodexo pay packets missing payments, employees did several days of industrial action, resulting in one of the longest strikes in NHS history. This resulted in all their demands being satisfied, and as there were 4 other hospitals administered by the same trust, all of their 1,200 Sodexo employees were brought in-house and became full NHS employees in January 2020. The employees were almost entirely black, latino and Asian people and/or migrants. The industrial action was co-ordinated by Loreta Younsi, a Lithuanian migrant, who had worked as a cleaner at the hospital for 12 years. A documentary called &quot;Fight for your rights: the trade union for outsourced workers&quot; was created afterwards and is on YouTube.

<text>The World Climate Change Conference was held in Moscow from September 29 to October 3, 2003. The initiative of convening the Conference was taken by Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Federation. The Conference was convened by the Russian Federation, and supported by international bodies including the United Nations . It should not be confused with the World Climate Conferences.

== Comments ==

The conference summary report , which was endorsed at concluding session of the Conference, October 3, 2003, endorsed the consensus represented by the IPCC TAR:

: &quot;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has provided the basis for much of our present understanding of knowledge in this field in its Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001. A large majority of the international scientific community has accepted its general conclusions that climate change is occurring, is primarily a result of human emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and that this represents a threat to people and ecosystems. Some divergent scientific interpretations were brought forward and discussed in the Conference.&quot;

Andreas Fischlin, conference participant and IPCC author was critical of the conference, saying:

: &quot;However, concerning the scientific content of the conference, we had also to struggle with considerable difficulties. Unfortunately, there were not only leading scientists present, but also some colleagues who used the conference to express personal, political opinions based on value judgement instead of scientific facts and rigorously derived, scientific insights and thorough understanding. Thereby, I believe, principles of proper scientific conduct were violated too often and sometimes, I am afraid having to say so, even systematically. This contrasts sharply with the principles upheld by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which allow only to assess the current knowledge based on the best available, peer reviewed scientific literature and which do not allow for any non-scientific value judgements, let alone policy recommendations.&quot;

<text>Storyville Records is an international record company and label based in Copenhagen, Denmark, specializing in jazz and blues music. Besides its original material, Storyville Records has reissued many vintage jazz recordings that previously appeared on labels such as Paramount Records, American Music Records, and Southland Records. Many Storyville records were pressed in Japan.

==History==
Storyville Records was founded in the 1950s by Karl Emil Knudsen, a Danish jazz record collector who was working for the Copenhagen telephone company. Named after Storyville, New Orleans, the red-light district, its focus has always been on jazz and blues.

The label&#x27;s first releases were 78 rpm reissues featuring Ma Rainey, Clarence Williams Blue Five, and James P. Johnson. Storyville soon began releasing original recordings, beginning with Ken Colyer&#x27;s Jazz Men, a British group including Chris Barber, Monty Sunshine, and Lonnie Donegan.

Knudsen was also co-founder of the Storyville Club, a Copenhagen venue that booked the Colyer band in 1953. The band was recorded by Chris Albertson during its stay in Denmark. These performances were the label&#x27;s first release of original material and remain in the Storyville catalog. Currently the catalog contains an eclectic mix of jazz genres. It has also expanded to include video releases and, under the umbrella company, JazzMedia, books and discographies.

When Karl Emil Knudsen died on September 5, 2003, the company continued to function under Anders Stefansen, who led it until 2005 when it was acquired by Edition Wilhelm Hansen, Denmark&#x27;s oldest music publishing company, a division of the Music Sales Group (now Wise Music Group).

<text>Bicycle culture can refer to a mainstream culture that supports the use of bicycles or to a subculture. Although &quot;bike culture&quot; is often used to refer to various forms of associated fashion, it is erroneous to call fashion in and of itself a culture.

Cycling culture refers to cities and countries which support a large percentage of utility cycling. Examples include the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Belgium (Flanders in particular), Sweden, Italy, China, Bangladesh and Japan. There are also towns in some countries where bicycle culture has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of Ílhavo, in Portugal. North American cities with strong bicycle cultures include Madison, Portland, San Francisco, Little Rock, Boston, Toronto, Montreal, Lincoln, Peoria, and the Twin Cities. In Latin America, Bogotá is often regarded as one of the most bike-friendly cities.

A city with a strong bicycle culture usually has a well-developed cycling infrastructure, including segregated bike lanes and extensive facilities catering to urban bicycles, such as bike racks.

== Advocacy and activism subcultures ==
In some cities and countries, transportation infrastructure is focused on automobiles, and large portions of the population use cars as their only local mechanical transport. Bicycling advocates include those who advocate for an increase in population-wide commuting, acceptance of cycling, and legislation and infrastructure to promote and protect the safety and rights of cyclists.

Cycling advocacy often aims to improve community bike infrastructure, including aspects such as bike lanes, parking facilities, and access to public transportation.

Within the cycling community, activism may take many forms, and may include creative and practical approaches. These include bike-related music, bike-related films, international exchange of hospitality (Warm Showers), organized bike rides (often noncompetitive—i.e. Critical Mass and World Naked Bike Ride), art bikes displays, printed-word materials (such as blogs, zines and magazines, stickers, and spoke cards), and the publication and distribution of books (such as: Thomas Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Around the World on a Bicycle&quot;, Mark Twain&#x27;s essay &quot;Taming the Bicycle&quot; and H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wheels of Chance)&quot;. There are hundreds of bicycle cooperatives offering spaces for cyclists to replace their own bikes and socialise.

=== Examples ===

Many cities contain subcultures of bicycle enthusiasts that include racers, bicycle messengers, bicycle transportation activists, mutant bicycle fabricators, bicycle mechanics, and bicycle commuters. Some such groups are affiliated with activism or counterculture groups. These hybrid groups often organize activities such as competitive cycling, fun rides, protests, and civil disobedience, such as Critical Mass. Some groups work to promote bicycle transportation (community bicycle program); others fix bicycles to give to children or the homeless (Bikes Not Bombs). There are also feminist groups of women of color who promote the empowerment of women through their rides such as Ovarian Psycos.

Bicycle magazines and organizations give awards to cities for being &quot;bicycle friendly&quot;. Examples include Boulder, Minneapolis, Austin, Philadelphia, Madison, Seattle, and Portland—all cities that promote bicycle culture.

Midnight Ridazz is a group of bicycle enthusiasts who ride every second Friday of the month in Los Angeles, California to inspire more people to ride bicycles. Rides often exceed 1,000 cyclists. Similar midnight rides such as the Midnight Mystery rides of Portland and Victoria, the bi-monthly Midnight Mass of Vancouver BC, and similar rides across the US and Europe have been growing in popularity.

San Jose Bike Party is another example of a large monthly social ride that regularly exceeds a thousand riders. It occurs on third Fridays of each month after the evening commute. Typically there are two regroup points allowing slower riders to catch up, which include music and food trucks.

== Mainstream bike cultures ==

Cycling is the norm in countries like the Netherlands and Denmark. In Denmark, 16 percent of all trips are made by bike—and as much as 50 percent of urban populations cycle to work and school. In the Netherlands, 63 percent of Amsterdam residents ride their bikes every day. Strong cycling infrastructure helps encourage cycling in these cities, and so cycling is the fastest, most convenient way to get from one place to another.

Mainstream bike cultures are characterized by notions of function over form. In mainstream bike cultures, there is less of a differentiation between cyclists and the rest of the population. People of all demographics cycle regularly, and most are less concerned about cycling attire and bike performance. It is not uncommon to see people cycle in business attire or on an old rusty bike.

<text>The United States Air Force&#x27;s Air Force Satellite Control Facility (AFSCF) was a space command and control unit located at Onizuka AFS, California. It has the distinction of being heavily involved in the world&#x27;s first reconnaissance satellite program, CORONA. Due to geological hazards (i.e. earthquakes), and the terrorism threat from its proximity to a major transportation link (California Highway 101), the facility&#x27;s command and control functions were moved to Schriever AFB, Colorado.

==History==
The Air Force Satellite Control Facility (AFSCF) was originally activated at Los Angeles AFS, California on 18 Jun 1965. It was first assigned to the Space Systems Division of Air Force Systems Command, with later moves under the Space and Missile Systems Organization, and Space Division organizations.

On 15 October 1961, Air Force Systems Command designated the Thule Tracking Station (TTS, ), a Remote Tracking Station (callsign: Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (POGO)) of the Air Force Satellite Control Network near Thule Air Base in Greenland. It became Operating Location 5, 6594th Test Wing (Satellite). The Thule Tracking Station reached operational status on 30 March 1962, with &quot;transportable antenna vans parked in an old Strategic Air Command bomb assembly building.&quot; The permanent RTS equipment was emplaced in 1964, and a communications terminal was emplaced on Pingarssuit Mountain—Thule Site N-32.

In 1992 the Thule Tracking Station became Detachment 2, 22nd Space Operations Squadron.

<text>Brazilian cruzeiro refers to any of four distinct Brazilian currencies: 

* Brazilian cruzeiro (1942–1967), worth 1000 Brazilian réis.
* Brazilian cruzeiro (1967–1986), denominated &quot;cruzeiro novo&quot; between 1967 and 1970 in the transition from the previous standard banknotes to the new banknotes issued by Casa da Moeda do Brasil to avoid confusion between the old and the new currency, worth 1000 old cruzeiros.
* Brazilian cruzeiro (1990–1993), redenomination of cruzado novo stemming from the Plano Collor.
* Brazilian cruzeiro real (1993–1994), currency with a view to facilitating accounting transactions in the transition between the 1990–1993 cruzeiro and real, necessary due to the difficulties of accounting values at the time due to inflation.

<text>The Kuskokwim Mountains is a range of mountains in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, United States, west of the Alaska Range and southeast of the Yukon River. The Kuskokwim Mountains begin in the interior west of Fairbanks. The mountain range extends from Canyon Creek and Chikuminuk Lake in the southwest over a distance of about long to the Tanana River in the northeast and reach a width of up to .

The southeast flank of the Kuskokwim Mountains borders the rivers Kantishna, Kuskokwim, Holitna and Kogrukluk. In the northwest lie the Kaiyuh, Russian and Kilbuck Mountains as well as the rivers Innoko, Dishna and Iditarod.

The range takes its name from the Kuskokwim River, which flows through the mountains, as well as Aniak and Nowitna rivers.

Reported and defined in 1898 by Josiah Edward Spurr of the USGS. Spurr applied the name &quot;Tanana Hills&quot; to the low mountains at the northeast end of what are now the Kuskokwim Mountains.

<doc id="1062264" wikidata="Q748761" url="?curid=1062264" title="Horton in Ribblesdale">
<text>Horton in Ribblesdale is a small village and civil parish in Ribblesdale in the former Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. It is situated on the Settle–Carlisle Railway to the west of Pen-y-ghent.

The parish extends from Helwith Bridge, south of the village, to a point north of the village. It includes the summits of Pen-y-Ghent and Plover Hill on the east side of the dale, and the summit of Simon Fell to the west. In addition to the village of Horton the parish includes the hamlets of Selside, High Birkwith, Brackenbottom and Studfold. Its population in the 2001 census was 498 people in 211 households; decreasing to 428 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
It is first attested as &quot;Horton&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, with &quot;in Ribblesdale&quot; being added already in the 13th century to distinguish it from Horton, Lancashire. The place-name &quot;Horton&quot; is a common one in England. It derives from Old English &quot;horu&quot; &#x27;dirt&#x27; and &quot;tūn&quot; &#x27;settlement, farm, estate&#x27;, presumably meaning &#x27;farm on muddy soil&#x27;.

Horton in Ribblesdale was historically a part of Ewcross wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a parish town in the early 12th century when the church of St. Oswald was established. This church was historically associated with the Deanery of Chester, and was part of the Diocese of York – though today it is part of the Diocese of Leeds. The surviving parish records date back to 1556.

In the 13th century the village and parish were ruled by rival monastic orders at Jervaulx Abbey and Fountains Abbey. Their dispute stemmed from a 1220 transfer of property here by William de Mowbray to the Fountains monks, which challenged the primacy of an earlier grant by Henry III to Jervaulx&#x27;s predecessors at Fors Abbey. Not until 1315 was this dispute firmly settled, when Edward II confirmed the Abbot of Jervaulx as Lord of Horton in Ribblesdale.

During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the monks&#x27; interests at Horton in Ribblesdale was attributed with an annual income of £32 and 5 shillings; and was given to the Earl of Lennox. He, in turn, disposed of the manor lands about 1569 or 1570 to a syndicate consisting of John Lennard, Ralph Scrope, Ralph Rokebie, Sampson Lennard, William Forest, Robert Cloughe and Henry Dyxon.

It seems the manor lands were eventually held solely by the family of John Lennard, the first named member of the syndicate. His daughter Lady Anne Lennard married Sir Leonard Bosville of Bradburne in Kent and together they sold their interests at Horton in Ribblesdale during the reign of Charles II to a partnership consisting of Lawrence Burton, Richard Wigglesworth and Francis Howson.

In 1597 Horton in Ribblesdale, like so much of northern England, was struck by a killer plague. This is confirmed by the parish burial register, which lists 74 deaths that year compared to just 17 deaths during the preceding and succeeding years. Those lost to this pandemic amounted to roughly one-eighth of the parish&#x27;s population.

In 1725, local squire John Armistead left an endowment to establish a free grammar school here.

==Governance==
From 1894 to 1974 Horton was part of Settle Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1974 it was transferred to Craven District in the new county of North Yorkshire. Craven District was abolished in 2023.

==Visitor attractions==
Horton in Ribblesdale is the traditional starting (and finishing) point for the Three Peaks walk. The Pennine Way and Ribble Way long-distance footpaths pass through the village.

The region is also popular for caving and potholing, with Alum Pot and the Long Churn cave system just to the north of the village, and Hull Pot and Hunt Pot on the western side of Pen-y-ghent.

The Three Peaks walk is an endurance challenge of distance, including of ascent and descent of the mountains of Pen-y-ghent, Whernside and Ingleborough all to be completed in under 12 hours which attracts thousands of walkers each year. The circuit is also used for a fell race in April, while the Three Peaks cyclo-cross race also visits the three summits in the course of a longer route on the last Sunday in September. Participants in both the running and cycling race regularly achieve winning times of around three hours, and sometimes both races in the year are won by the same competitor.

==Local architecture and amenities==

The village has two pubs, the Crown Hotel and the Golden Lion. In 2006 a villager controversially installed a radio telescope.

St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Horton in Ribblesdale is Grade I listed. It has a complete Norman nave, south door and tub-font and is the most complete of the Norman churches built in the Yorkshire Dales after the Norman conquest and the Harrying of the North that followed. The square tower was built later. The lychgates to enter the churchyard are roofed with slabs of Horton slate.

Other buildings in Horton are typical of the area. 17th-century yeomen&#x27;s farmhouses can be found on the edge of the village, and later cottages can be seen nearer the centre of the village. In the 1870s the new railway prompted the building of Victorian terraced housing. Later the local quarrying of limestone led to the building of housing for the quarrymen.

<text>The .475 Linebaugh (12.1x36mmR) is a rimmed revolver cartridge developed by John Linebaugh in the late 1980s in response to the scarcity of the .348 Winchester brass required to form his .500 Linebaugh cartridge. The cartridge is based on the .45-70 Government case trimmed to 1.4 inches and loaded with bullets. While dimensionally similar to the older .45 Silhouette cartridge, the .475 Linebaugh is loaded to considerably higher pressures, resulting in significantly different ballistic performance.

The .475 Linebaugh was first announced in the May 1988 issue of &quot;Guns &amp; Ammo&quot; in an article written by Ross Seyfried. In 1991, Linebaugh announced a 1.6 inch variant of the .475 Linebaugh for use in converted Ruger .357 Maximum revolvers. This cartridge is known as the .475 Linebaugh Long or .475 Linebaugh Maximum, and produces somewhat greater ballistic performance than the shorter round.

==Usage==
The .475 Linebaugh is intended primarily for hunting and defense against big game. The .475 is capable of propelling a bullet at a muzzle velocity of , developing of muzzle energy from a 5.5&quot; barrel. These figures compare favorably to those of the popular .44 Magnum, which fires a bullet at , producing of muzzle energy from a 7.5&quot; barrel. The .475 Linebaugh is ballistically comparable to the .454 Casull, .500 Linebaugh, and &quot;Trapdoor level&quot; loadings of the .45-70 Government, though it is less powerful than the .460 S&amp;W Magnum, .500 Wyoming Express, .500 S&amp;W Magnum, and .500 Bushwhacker rounds, as well as Linebaugh&#x27;s own .475 and .500 Maximum cartridges. With the exception of the .500 Wyoming Express, however, the .475 Linebaugh is generally chambered in lighter and more compact revolvers than such &quot;super magnum&quot; cartridges, lending itself to easier carry and field use. This results in a relatively high power-to-weight ratio which, in the absence of a muzzle brake, often entails greater felt recoil than produced by heavier firearms chambered in more powerful cartridges.

In 2003, Ruger introduced the .480 Ruger, which is essentially a .475 Linebaugh shortened to 1.285 inches with a marginally lower pressure ceiling (48,000 psi for the .480 Ruger vs. 50,000 psi for the .475 Linebaugh). The performance and recoil generated by the .480 Ruger with standard loadings are comparatively less than those of the .475 Linebaugh. Furthermore, just as the .38 Special cartridge will chamber and fire in revolvers chambered for the more powerful .357 Magnum, the .480 Ruger will chamber and fire in revolvers chambered for the .475 Linebaugh. However, given their comparable operating pressures, the two rounds are far closer in performance than such a comparison would seem to suggest.

The .475 Linebaugh remains a relatively obscure cartridge, owing in part to the commercial success of Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s more powerful .460 S&amp;W Magnum and .500 S&amp;W Magnum cartridges. However, while the .475 Linebaugh was once an exclusively custom proposition, both the Freedom Arms Model 83 and the Magnum Research BFR are currently available in the cartridge.

<doc id="1062267" wikidata="Q1086633" url="?curid=1062267" title="Declaration and forfeiture">
<text>In the sport of cricket, a declaration occurs when a captain declares their team&#x27;s innings closed and a forfeiture occurs when a captain chooses to forfeit an innings without batting. Declaration and forfeiture are covered in Law 15 of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;. This concept applies only to matches in which each team is scheduled to bat in two innings; Law 15 specifically does not apply in any form of limited overs cricket.

==Declaration==
The captain of the batting side may declare an innings closed, when the ball is dead, at any time during a match. Usually this is because the captain thinks their team has already scored enough runs to win the match and does not wish to consume any further time batting which would make it easier for the opponents to play out for a draw. Tactical declarations are sometimes used in other circumstances.

In May 1889, the laws of cricket were revised to allow for declarations but on condition they only took place on the final day of the match. The first captain to declare in English first-class cricket was Charles Wright in 1890. In a game against Kent at the Bat and Ball Ground in Gravesend, Wright declared Nottinghamshire&#x27;s second innings closed on 157 for 5 to set Kent a target of 231 to win. The tactic nearly paid off as the game was drawn with Kent on 98 for 9 and Nottinghamshire requiring one more wicket to win.

Frank May proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Marylebone Cricket Club on 2 May 1906 that in a two-day match, the captain of the batting side has power to declare their innings closed at any time, but such declaration may not be made on the first day later than one hour and forty minutes before the hour of drawing stumps. After some discussion the resolution was passed. 

Before declarations were made legal the batsmen of a team that wanted to get the other team to bat again would have to deliberately get themselves out.

===Tactical considerations===
The basic tactical idea of declaration is that a team declares because they feel they have enough runs to produce a positive result in the current match situation. The specifics of when to declare will come down to which innings of the match is being played, the time when the declaration occurs and how much of the match is left to play. A common example of timing a declaration is when the declaration comes near the end of play for the day. A team who have batted through the day may decide that the extra runs on offer are worth less than the opportunity to bowl at a team who are tired from standing in the field all day.

A team in the first of the four innings can have to make a tactical choice between continuing to bat in their first innings and declaring. The existence of the follow-on law makes amassing a very large lead worthwhile as it can prevent the game from being lost due to how long it would take a team to equalise the scores even if they avoid being bowled out. Declaring with a large total and many wickets in hand can be a choice that backfires if the team batting second go on to make their own very large total. A significant amount of the highest innings totals in Test cricket have come from the team batting second and some have gone on to win those games.

Weather conditions can also make a team decide to declare. If rain may put an end to a match prematurely and there is an incentive to product a result it may make a team declare on what would normally be a low total as they try to win the shortened match. The Sticky wicket that existed before covered pitches could induce very low total declarations. In the First Test of the 1950–51 Ashes series. As recorded in &quot;The Ashes&#x27; Strangest Moments&quot;, as the pitch at the Gabba began to dry, England declared their first innings at just 68/7, in order to exploit the conditions. Australia were even more extreme, declaring at 32/7. &quot;...the ball proceeded to perform capers all against the laws of gravitation, and there came the craziest day&#x27;s cricket imaginable, with twenty wickets falling for 130 runs and two declarations that must surely be unique in the annals of Test cricket.&quot;

A team batting in the 3rd innings of the match can declare in order to attempt to bowl out their opponents in a short amount of time rather than allowing the game to meander to a draw. In their 1984 tour of Sri Lanka, New Zealand beat the hosts by declaring to set a target of 263 runs shortly after lunch on day 5. Arjuna Ranatunga scored 51 but the rest of the team collapsed around him and shortly after his caught &amp; bowled exit off John Bracewell it was Stephen Boock who took the final wicket with Sri Lanka on 97 from 28 overs. In games where innings have taken a significant amount of time, or where weather has delayed play there are cases of a &quot;draw by agreement&quot; that ends the game following a declaration of the third innings.

The fact that a team ends their innings and gives up the chance to score mores runs can make declarations a bad decision in hindsight. In the 2nd Test of the 2012–13 Border–Gavaskar Trophy the Australian side declared so they could bowl at India for 3 overs at the end of the first day rather than see if their final pair of batsmen could score additional runs. India went on to score 503 in their only innings of the game as Australia collapsed all out for 131 in their 2nd innings, losing the game by an innings &amp; 135 runs.

In 2017 England declared while hosting the West Indies in the 2nd test, at 490/8d in their 2nd innings. This left the West Indies a target of 322 to win from 96 overs. The opening batters navigated the 6 over spell before stumps and on the final day Kraigg Brathwaite scored 95 &amp; Shai Hope 118 not out to give his side an unlikely 5 wicket win 6 overs before the close of play.

During the English tour of South Africa in 1948/49, the 5th test ended with an English victory. South Africa declared on 3/187 to give England a target of 172. The English achieved that figure in their 24th over for the loss of 7 wickets. Jack Crapp hit 10 runs off 3 balls to secure the win which came one minute before the 4 day game was due to finish.

There have been occasions where a team have declared in both their innings and lost. South Africa faced Australia in Sydney in 2006, South Africa scored 451/9d and 194/6d. Australia scored 359 in their first innings and were set 287 runs for victory in their second. Matthew Hayden &amp; Ricky Ponting put up a 150 run partnership for the 3rd wicket then Ponting &amp; Brad Hodge secured the win in the 61st over as Ponting finished not out on 143. In 1968 Garry Sobers and his West Indian team declared on 526/7 and 92/2 to set England 215 to win in 3 hours, that the English did through half-centuries to Geoffrey Boycott and Colin Cowdrey to win the game with 7 wickets &amp; 3 minutes to spare.

==Forfeiture==

Under the current Laws, a captain may forfeit either of their side&#x27;s innings. A forfeited innings shall be considered as a completed innings. Usually this happens in shorter competitive two-innings matches, where captains need to agree with each other how to set up the match so that there is a reasonable chance of a result. Winning a game gains a team considerably more points than drawing it, so captains are often willing to risk giving the opposition an opportunity to win that they otherwise would not have had as long as they are getting a similar opportunity in return.

In August 2020, in a rain-affected match between Durham and Leicestershire in the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy, both teams agreed to forfeit an innings in an attempt to produce a result.

===Test cricket===

Only one innings has been voluntarily forfeited in Test cricket. This was on 18 January 2000 at Centurion, South Africa, in the fifth and final Test between South Africa and England. South Africa had already won the series, as they were up 2–0 (with 2 matches drawn) after the first four matches. After South Africa scored 155 for 6 on the first day, rain washed out the next three days. With only one day remaining, the match was set for a certain draw.

That was until Hansie Cronje, the South African captain, entered into a deal with his English counterpart, Nasser Hussain, that South Africa would continue batting till they reached about 250 and then declare. England and then South Africa would then both forfeit an innings, leaving England approximately 250 to win (in the event the target was 249). At that time, the laws only permitted a side to forfeit its second innings, so England&#x27;s first innings was treated as having been declared at 0 for 0 after 0 balls. England went on to score 251 for 8 and win by 2 wickets. 

It later emerged that Cronje had been approached by a bookmaker, and asked to ensure the game would end with a positive result. Nasser Hussain and the England team were not aware of this at the time, taking the South African request at face value.

<text>W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills was a British tobacco manufacturing company formed in Bristol, England. It was the first British company to mass-produce cigarettes. It was one of the 13 founding companies of the Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great Britain and Ireland); these firms became branches, or divisions, of the new combine and included John Player &amp; Sons.

The company was founded by Henry O. Wills in 1786, and went by various names before 1830 when it became &quot;W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills&quot;. Tobacco was processed and sold under several brand names, some of which were still used by Imperial Tobacco until the second half of the 20th century. The company pioneered the use of cigarette cards within their packaging. Many of the buildings in Bristol and other cities around the United Kingdom still exist with several being converted to residential use.

The brand &quot;Wills&quot; was withdrawn by Imperial Tobacco in 1988 for the majority of its products.

== History ==
Henry O. Wills arrived in Bristol in 1786 from Salisbury, and opened a tobacco shop on Castle Street with his partner Samuel Watkins. They named their firm &quot;Wills, Watkins &amp; Co.&quot;. When Watkins retired in 1789, the firm became &quot;Wills &amp; Co.&quot; Next, the company was known from 1791 to 1793 as &quot;Lilly, Wills &amp; Co&quot;, when it merged with the firm of Peter Lilly, who owned a snuff mill on the Land Yeo at Barrow Gurney. The company then was known from 1793 up until Lilly&#x27;s retirement in 1803 as &quot;Lilly and Wills&quot;.

In 1826, H.O. Wills&#x27;s sons William Day Wills and Henry O. Wills II took over the company, which in 1830 became &quot;W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills&quot;. William Day Wills&#x27; middle name is from his mother Anne Day of Bristol. Both W.D. and H.O. Wills were non-smokers. Other members of the family joined the business, such as Henry O. Wills III in 1846, and William Henry Wills in 1858. When William Day Wills died in May, 1865, two days after stepping in front of a horse-drawn carriage, necessitating the amputation of his left leg, 2000 people attended his funeral at Arnos Vale Cemetery.

During the 1860s, a new factory was built to replace the original Redcliffe Street premises, but the firm quickly outgrew it. The East Street factory of W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills, in Bedminster, opened in 1886, with a high tea for the 900 employees in the Cigar Room. The new factory was expected to meet the needs of the company for the remainder of the century but, it was doubled in size within a decade and, early in the 1900s, a further Bristol factory was created in Raleigh Road, Southville.

That growth was largely due to the success of cigarettes. The firm&#x27;s first brand was &quot;Bristol&quot;, made at the London factory from 1871 to 1974. &quot;Three Castles&quot; and &quot;Gold Flake&quot; followed in 1878, but the greatest success was the machine-made &quot;Woodbine&quot; ten years later. &quot;Embassy&quot; was introduced in 1914 and relaunched in 1962 with coupons. Other popular brands included &quot;Capstan&quot; and &quot;Passing Clouds&quot;. The company also made cigar brands such as &quot;Castella&quot; and &quot;Whiffs&quot;, several pipe tobacco brands and &quot;Golden Virginia&quot; hand-rolling tobacco.

In 1901, the Wills family organised a concerted response by British tobacco manufacturers to the aggressive entry into the UK market by the American Tobacco Company. This initiative on the part of 13 companies resulted in the incorporation of the Imperial Tobacco Company on 10 December 1901, and its consolidation as the predominant producer in the UK; seven of its directors were members of the Wills family. In 1902 the subsequent truce with American Tobacco saw the creation of the jointly owned British American Tobacco; the new subsidiary, which was established with Wills&#x27;s export factory, was allocated markets outside the USA and the UK.

Imperial Tobacco remained one of the world&#x27;s largest tobacco companies until it was acquired by the Hanson Trust in 1986. A decade later, in 1996, Hanson demerged its tobacco manufacturing assets to a new company floated on the Stock Exchange, the Imperial Group.

Wills major factories and offices were located in Bedminster, Bristol, with other facitilities in Holborn, London, Swindon, Newcastle and Glasgow.

Up until 1920, only women and girls were employed as cigar-makers. One clause in the women&#x27;s contract stipulated:
She shall not contract Matrimony within the said Term, nor play at Card or Dice Tables, or any other unlawful Games.

In 1898 Henry Herbert Wills visited Australia which led to the establishment of &quot;W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills (Australia) Ltd.&quot; in 1900.
The largest cigarette factory in Europe was opened at Hartcliffe, Bristol, designed in 1974 by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, but closed in 1990. It proved impossible to find a new use for the premises and the building was demolished in 1999. Its site is now the Imperial Park retail complex, but the associated offices became Lakeshore, residential apartments, created by Urban Splash.

The facade of the large factory in Bedminster, and the bonded warehouses at Cumberland Basin, remain prominent buildings in Bristol, although much of the existing land and buildings have been converted to other uses, such as The Tobacco Factory Theatre.

The Newcastle factory closed in 1986 and stood derelict for over a decade, before the front of the Art Deco building – which was preserved by being Grade II listed – reopened in 1998 as a block of luxury apartments. (See main article: Wills Building) The factory in Glasgow has similarly been converted into offices.

The last member of the Wills family to serve the company was Christopher, the great great grandson of H.O. Wills I, who retired as sales research manager in 1969.

In 1988 Imperial Tobacco withdrew the &quot;Wills&quot; brand in the United Kingdom, except for the popular Woodbine and Capstan &quot;Full Strength&quot; brands, which still carry the name.

When Princess Elizabeth visited the Bedminster factory on 3 March 1950 she was given cigarette cards as a gift for her son, future King Charles III.

===Benevolence===
The company pioneered canteens for the workers, free medical care, sports facilities and paid holidays. Wills commissioned portraits of long-serving employees, several of which are held by Bristol Museum and Art Gallery and some of which can be seen on display at the M Shed museum. In 1893, the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills Ltd Association Football Team was established, and the company also held singing classes for the younger workers and women that year. In 1899, wives of Wills employees serving in the Boer War were granted 10s per week by the factory.

==Archives==
Bristol Archives holds extensive records of W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills and Imperial Tobacco. In addition there are photographs of the Newcastle factory of W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills at Tyne and Wear Archives.

M Shed in Bristol holds the Wills Collection of Tobacco Antiquities, consisting of advertising, marketing and packaging samples from the company&#x27;s history, photographs and artefacts relating to the history of tobacco.

== Notable products ==

From the early 20th century to April 1951 &quot;Pirate&quot; was one of the most recognized cigarette brands in China. In Chinese it was commonly referred to as &#x27;lao dao pai&#x27;, meaning &#x27;Old Knife Brand&#x27; in reference to the sword the pirate was carrying on the brand&#x27;s key visual. The brand had a short revival in China under different ownership in 1994 but was eventually discontinued in 1997.

In 1959 the company launched the short-lived Strand brand. This was accompanied by the memorable but disastrous, &quot;You&#x27;re never alone with a Strand&quot; television advertisement.

In India, the Gold Flake, Classic and Wills Navy Cut range of cigarettes, manufactured by ITC, formerly the &quot;Imperial Tobacco Company of India Limited&quot;, still has W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills printed on the cigarettes and their packaging. These lines of cigarettes have a dominant market share.

== Cigarette cards ==

In 1887, Wills were one of the first UK tobacco companies to include advertising cards in their packs of cigarettes, but it was not until 1895 that they produced their first general interest set of cards (&#x27;Ships and Sailors&#x27;). Other Wills sets include &#x27;Aviation&#x27; (1910), &#x27;Lucky Charms&#x27; (1923), &#x27;British Butterflies&#x27; (1927), &#x27;Famous Golfers&#x27; (1930), &#x27;Garden Flowers&#x27; (1933) and &#x27;Air Raid Precautions&#x27; (1938).

Wills also released several sports sets, such as the cricket (1901, 1908, 1909, 1910), association football (1902, 1935, 1939), rugby union (1902, 1929) and Australian rules football (1905) series.

== Trivia ==
The factory in Hartcliffe, Bristol, was used for location filming for the UK television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, for the 1977 serial &quot;The Sun Makers&quot;. Filming at the Wills Factory spanned 13 to 15 June 1977. In addition to the roof and tunnels, scenes were also filmed in the lift and the roof vent.

<doc id="1062280" wikidata="Q158700" url="?curid=1062280" title=".22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire">
<text>The .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire, also known as the .22 WMR, .22 Magnum, .22 WMRF, .22 MRF, or .22 Mag, is a rimfire cartridge. Originally loaded with a bullet weight of delivering velocities in the range from a rifle barrel, .22 WMR is now loaded with bullet weights ranging from at to at .

==History==
The .22 WMR was introduced in 1959 by Winchester, but was not used by Winchester until the Winchester Model 61 slide rifle could be chambered for it in 1960. The first rifle to be offered in the new chambering was the Marlin Levermatic rifle in 1959, because its design was easily modified to accept the more powerful cartridge. By the time of the introduction of the Winchester 61, Smith &amp; Wesson and Ruger had revolvers for it, and Savage had come out with the Model 24 and since late 2012, the Model 42, a more modern update than the 24, a .22/.410 rifle/shotgun combination gun. It was the only successful rimfire cartridge introduced in the 20th century.

==Dimensions and loading==
The .22 WMR uses a larger case than the more popular .22 LR, both in diameter and length. The .22 WMR case is a lengthened version of the older .22 WRF and both of these cartridges have the bullet seated within the case, instead of using a heeled bullet as in the .22 LR. In the most common modern .22 WMR loadings using a bullet, the combination of more powder and higher sustained pressures gives velocities of from a rifle and from a handgun. A .22 WMR round will not fit into the chamber of a .22 LR firearm due to the greater length and width of the case dimensions. 

Although the bullet diameters are the same, the larger .22 WMR chamber does not support the smaller .22 LR cartridge. Firing the smaller .22 LR round in a .22 WMR chamber results in swollen or split cartridge cases, high-pressure gas leakage from the rear of the chamber, and bullets striking the chamber throat out of alignment, which can result in injury to the shooter or bystander and which does result in poor ammunition performance. 

Gun makers offer .22 revolver models with cylinders chambered either in .22 LR or in .22 WMR and as convertible kits with both cylinders which allow the shooter to easily switch calibers on the same firearm.

==Uses==
Since the .22 WMR uses bullets comparable in weight to the .22 Long Rifle, but is considerably faster, it shoots flatter and farther and hits harder at all ranges. The same bullet from a .22 WMR at still has 50% more kinetic energy than .22 LR at the muzzle. The .22 WMR provides improved penetration and more reliable expansion at longer ranges with expanding bullets.

If sighted in for maximum point blank range on a high target, the .22 WMR has an effective range of nearly . This makes the .22 WMR an effective short to medium-range varmint rifle and hunting rifle cartridge. The .22 WMR can effectively kill small game such as rabbits, hares, groundhogs, prairie dogs, foxes, raccoons, opossums, and coyotes. The relatively quiet report and negligible recoil also make it a very pleasant target and plinking round to shoot for extended periods.

==Firearms using .22 WMR==
It first appeared in the Marlin Model 57M Levermatic carbines in 1959, which was followed by the .22 WMR over .410 bore Savage Model 24 combination gun, followed by Winchester&#x27;s own Model 61 and 275 pump-action rifles and Model 255 lever-action rifle. The Chiappa Double Badger combination gun also comes with a .22 WMR over .410 bore option. The Springfield Armory M6 Scout is also made in .22 Magnum over .410 bore. The Chiappa M6 Survival Gun is similar combination gun that comes with a 12 gauge or 20 gauge shotgun barrel over a .22 Magnum barrel.

A number of single-shot and repeating rifles were offered in .22 WMR. The .22 WMR operates at pressures beyond what normal blowback actions typically handle, but the self-loading Jefferson Model 159 was introduced for the cartridge. Until the 1990s, most .22 WMR firearms were bolt-action rifles. In 1977-1985 Harrington &amp; Richardson produced the first American-made semi-automatic .22 WMR. In the 1990s semi-automatic .22 WMR rifles were also introduced by Ruger (10/22) and Marlin, and are currently produced by Remington (Model 597) and Tanfoglio Appeal Rifle as well as the Excel Arms Accelerator Rifle and Savage arms A22 magnum.

Revolvers in .22 WMR are made by Smith &amp; Wesson, Colt, Taurus, North American Arms, Heritage Arms, and Sturm Ruger. Semi-automatic pistols for this cartridge are (or were) produced by Kel-Tec, Grendel and AMT, the latter two now defunct (AMT has been since resurrected by High Standard). The Grendel, AMT and Kel-Tec designs used specially designed chambers with flutes or gas ports, designed to lubricate the long, thin cartridge with gases from the chamber, overcoming the Blish effect and allowing easy extraction of the cartridge. High-Standard produced various models and versions of their classic two-shot over/under derringer in both .22 WMR and .22 LR.
The Marlin Model 25MG is a smooth bore, eight-shot, magazine-fed, .22 WMR, bolt-action shotgun manufactured by Marlin Firearms. It was specifically designed to use snake shot, and marketed as a &quot;garden gun&quot; for use in dispatching small garden and farm pests. It has an effective range of about 15 yards when using snake shot. Based on earlier Marlin .22 caliber designs, the garden gun was equipped with a high-visibility front sight but no rear sight.
The Argentine EDDA submachine gun uses the .22 WMR round.

In 2014 Kel-Tec released the CMR-30, a PDW-style rifle chambered in .22 WMR with a 16&quot; barrel and a 1:14 twist rate. It uses the same double stack 30-round magazine as the PMR-30.

In 2018 Standard Manufacturing introduced an 8-round .22 WMR revolver at the Las Vegas Shot Show. The revolver was originally introduced as the Volleyfire. The gun has side-by-side barrels, and fires 2 rounds of .22 WMR (1 bullet per barrel) with every pull of the trigger. In 2019 the gun went into production and was renamed &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;.

In recent years, a few UK companies such as Guncraft Ltd have been making semi-automatic AR-15-style rifles chambered in 22 WMR, marketed to civilian shooters who, due to the UK&#x27;s restrictive gun laws, do not have access to self-loading center-fire rifles.

==Ammunition==

The .22 WMR is an enlarged, more powerful version of the much earlier .22 WRF. Despite frequent claims to the contrary, it cannot be safely used in any firearm except those specifically chambered for it. Even firearms chambered for the .22 WRF are not suitable; for one thing, the case lengths are different, and the fact that the cartridge fits into the chamber does not guarantee that using the wrong cartridge is either safe or effective.

The .22 WMR was for a time the most powerful rimfire round available; it even outperformed the .22 WCF. It has since been eclipsed in velocity and overall kinetic energy by the .17 Winchester Super Magnum.

Commonly available in retail stores, the selection and availability of the .22 WMR nevertheless does not match the popular .22 Long Rifle. Furthermore, .22 WMR is typically much more expensive than .22 LR per round, though it is comparable to .17 HMR, which is much more similar in overall performance, and is less expensive than .22 caliber centerfire ammunition.

Because many of the rifles that are chambered for the .22 WMR have tubular magazines, the bullet noses generally are flat or at least blunt to allow smooth feeding and reduce damage to the bullet. Although a pointed bullet in a rimfire cartridge will not contact the primer of the round in front of it (which is a hazard with centerfire cartridges in a tubular magazine), the manufacturer&#x27;s stamp is in the middle of the base of a rimfire cartridge, and this may interfere with pointed metal bullets in a tube. However, Remington, CCI, and Hornady now produce bullet designs with 30 or polymer plastic ballistic tips that reduce the hazards of pointed ammunition in tubular magazines.

Bullets for the .22 WMR are generally unlubricated lead with heavy copper plating, in either solid nose or hollow point style designed for small game hunting or pest control (varmint hunting).

The limited selection of commercial ammunition for the .22 WMR has inspired specialist wildcatters to select the .22 WMR case for handloading high performance rimfire ammunition. Generally they load the wildcat cartridges with pointed bullets for the aerodynamic advantages, using the same bullets as those in .22 caliber centerfire cartridges. Though such bullets are generally heavier than standard .22 WMR, the sharp nose and tapered tail conserve energy better, delivering greater impact at longer ranges.

Other wildcatters neck the .22 WMR down to smaller calibers, such as .20 (5 mm) and .17 (4.5 mm) or even smaller, in an attempt to get maximum velocity and the flattest possible trajectory. An example of such an experimental design is the Swedish 4.5×26mm MKR.

<text>The cruzado was the currency of Brazil from 1986 to 1989. It replaced the second cruzeiro (at first called the &quot;cruzeiro novo&quot;) in 1986, at a rate of 1 cruzado = 1000 cruzeiros (novos) and was replaced in 1989 by the cruzado novo at a rate of 1000 cruzados = 1 cruzado novo.

This currency was subdivided in 100 centavos and it had the symbol formula_1 and the ISO 4217 code &quot;BRC&quot;.

== Coins ==

=== Standard ===
Stainless-steel coins were introduced in 1986 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos, and 1 and 5 cruzados, with 10 cruzados following in 1987. Coin production ceased in 1988.

=== Commemorative ===
Three designs of commemorative 100 cruzado coins, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the country (the Lei Áurea), were produced in 1988. Although very rare in circulation, the numbers&#x27; design was carried over into both Cruzado Novo and the third Cruzeiro.

== Banknotes ==
The first banknotes were overprints on cruzeiro notes, in denominations of 10, 50 and 100 cruzados. Regular notes followed in denominations of 10, 50, 100 and 500 cruzados, followed by 1000 cruzados in 1987, 5000 and 10,000 cruzados in 1988.

<doc id="1062302" wikidata="Q6652917" url="?curid=1062302" title="Littlecote House">
<text>Littlecote House is a large Elizabethan country house and estate in the civil parishes of Ramsbury and Chilton Foliat, in the English county of Wiltshire, about northeast of the Berkshire town of Hungerford. The estate includes 34 hectares of historic parklands and gardens, including a walled garden dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. In its grounds is Littlecote Roman Villa.

A Grade I listed building, Littlecote House is now a hotel and leisure centre.

== History ==

=== Early house ===
The first Littlecote House was built during the 13th century and was the home of the de Calstone family from around 1290. In 1415 Elizabeth de Calstone married William Darrell and the Darrell family inherited the estate.

Elizabeth Darrell&#x27;s half-niece, also named Elizabeth Darrell, was a maid of honour to Henry VIII&#x27;s first queen Catherine of Aragon and had a well-publicised affair with the poet Sir Thomas Wyatt.

===16th century===
In the mid-1530s, King Henry VIII is said to have courted his third wife Jane Seymour at Littlecote; the reason seems to be that Jane&#x27;s grandmother was Elizabeth Darrell.

The last of the Darrell owners is connected with several scandals and the house&#x27;s resident ghost story. William Darrell&#x27;s father had left the house to his mistress Mary Danyell, but Darrell was able to recover it when he came of age in 1560. He spent lavishly, left his debts unpaid, and went to law with most of his neighbours, acquiring enemies in the process. Sir John Popham was his relative and lawyer.

Darrell had an affair with Anne Hungerford, the wife of Sir Walter Hungerford (Knight of Farley), his neighbour; when Sir Walter sued for divorce, she was acquitted and Sir Walter was sent to prison. Some years later, Mother Barnes, a midwife from Great Shefford, recalled being brought in 1575 to the childbed of a lady, with a gentleman standing by who commanded her to save the life of the mother, but who (as soon as the child was born) threw it into the fire. Barnes did not name or indicate either Darrell or Littlecote, but his enemies quickly ascribed this murder to him.

Darrell&#x27;s financial troubles increased, and he mortgaged Littlecote, first to Sir Thomas Bromley, and then to Popham. He moved to London and spent some time in a debtors&#x27; prison, but died suddenly in 1589 on a visit to Littlecote. Legend has it that whilst hunting, the ghost of the murdered newborn appeared to him, causing his horse to shy and throw him. Darrell is said to haunt the site of his death, known as Darrell&#x27;s stile (or Style, as well as the church at Ramsbury, two miles away), although one famed clairvoyant, Tom Corbett, detected nothing of the sort. But he reported to the author Peter Underwood that he did see &quot;a ghost in the garden, a beautiful woman whom he later recognised from a portrait in the house as Mrs Leyborne Popham&quot;, and another ghost in the Chinese bedroom he termed a &quot;busybody&quot;, a word Mrs. Wills, wife of the then owner Major George Wills, agreed described the presence in that room. Another possible ghost is that of a past tenant, Gerard Lee Bevan, who lived at Littlecote after World War I and later served time for embezzlement. His presence has been felt in the Long Gallery.

John Aubrey tells that Littlecote was a bribe to Popham as his judge in a criminal case, which is impossible: Darrell was not charged or tried, and Popham was not yet a judge. Nevertheless, this story was borrowed by Sir Walter Scott, in &quot;Rokeby&quot;, and by Charles Dickens, in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

=== The present house ===
Sir John Popham bought the reversion of Littlecote, and succeeded to it on Darrell&#x27;s death in 1589; he then built the present Elizabethan brick mansion, which was completed in 1592.

James I, Charles II, and William of Orange stayed there, the latter on his march from Torbay to London in the so-called &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688 in which he superseded the Catholic King James II.

A unique room that can still be seen today is the so-called &quot;Dutch Parlour&quot;. A plaque in the corridor outside states that this was decorated with paintings by Dutch seamen who were captured in about 1666 in a war between England and the Dutch; these paintings cover the walls and the ceiling.
The Popham family owned the estate until 1805. In the mid-1600s the family played a role in the history of deaf education in which John Wallis and William Holder taught Sir John&#x27;s great-grandson, Alexander Popham (born 1648), to overcome his disability and be able to speak. Sir John (1531–1600) was Speaker of the House of Commons, and five of his descendants were also Members of Parliament: Sir Francis (1573–1644; elected on nine occasions), John (1603–c.1638), Alexander (1605–1669), Sir Francis (1646–1674), and Alexander (c.1670–1705).

In 1805 the family name became Leyborne Popham, under whom much of the house was refurbished in 1810. The Leyborne Popham family owned the estate until 1929, when it was purchased by Sir Ernest Salter Wills Bt, who was a member of the well-known Wills tobacco dynasty founded by Henry Overton Wills I as W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills Ltd, in 1787. Sir Ernest was a major shareholder and a director of the Imperial Tobacco company, which also owned the nearby Ramsbury Manor.

===Second World War===


During the Second World War, the house was requisitioned by the Government for use by the military.

In 1942-43 the house was the headquarters of the 34th Army Tank Brigade, 34th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom) commanded by Brigadier Noel Tetley.

In September 1943, the US 101st Airborne Division took over part of the house, and it became home to regimental staff, regimental headquarters company, and headquarters company of the 1st Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The house provided office space and sleeping quarters for officers of the 506th, with the best rooms being allocated to Col. Robert F. Sink, regimental commander, and Lt. Col. Charles H. Chase, his executive officer. The colonel used the library as his office, and a memorial plaque can be seen today in this room.

From airfields in this area, including Ramsbury just to the west, the Airborne Division took off during the night of 5/6 June 1944 as part of the invasion of Normandy. Easy Company from this regiment have become famous through the book and TV mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. All other ranks lived in Nissen huts built alongside the main drive between the house and the east lodge.

During the Second World War (and during Sir Ernest Wills&#x27;s tenure as HM&#x27;s Lord Lieutenant for the County of Wiltshire, 1930–1942) King George VI paid a visit to Littlecote in 1943. The King was acquainted with Sir Ernest since his great nephew, Major John Lycett Wills of the Lifeguards, had married King George&#x27;s niece, the Hon. Jean Constance Elphinstone.

=== Post-War ===
After the war, ownership reverted to the Wills family. Sir Ernest&#x27;s younger son, Major George Seton Wills, inherited the estate in 1958 and gifted it to his only son and heir, David Seton Wills, in 1966. Following the latter&#x27;s succession to the Baronetcy in 1983, he sold the house to the entrepreneur Peter de Savary in 1985. In the same year, the house&#x27;s collection of Civil War weaponry and armour – begun by Parliamentary colonel Alexander Popham – was offered for auction, and bought in its entirety by Royal Armouries.

In 1996 De Savary sold the estate to Warner Holidays, who now operate it as a country house hotel and resort.

==Littlecote Roman Villa==
In the grounds is Littlecote Roman Villa, a Roman winged corridor villa and associated religious complex. It has been excavated under the direction of Bryn Walters, and is on display to the public.

== Location ==
Littlecote House is on the south bank of the River Kennet between the villages of Ramsbury and Chilton Foliat, and about two miles northwest of the small Berkshire town of Hungerford. It is also in the heart of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

<doc id="1062307" wikidata="Q3354131" url="?curid=1062307" title="Ophir, Alaska">
<text>Ophir is an unincorporated area located in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska.

It was named by miners after the wealthy land of Ophir mentioned in the Old Testament. The area was the site of a gold rush in 1906. Ophir reached a peak population of 122 in 1910.

Ophir is now abandoned, but serves as a checkpoint in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. An airport with a single gravel runway exists at the village, built prior to 1949. It is currently in disuse and unmaintained.

There are a number of creeks near Ophir, all on the west bank of the Innoko, where gold placers were located starting about 1906. Yankee Creek is the closest to the source of the river, then , Little and Spruce Creeks, all above Ophir Creek. The original Iditarod trail ran above Ganes Creek in the summer, down the Innoko valley in the winter; the current race trail goes through the old townsite, which was destroyed in a brush fire started by a camper in the 1970s, and is a rest stop.

Mining still goes on at and Little Creeks, and probably at Ophir Creek (2006). Further downriver, on the east side, there were mining operations at Folger, Cripple, Bear and Colorado Creeks. Bear Creek and Colorado still are actively mined (2006). Mining of tailings was underway at Cripple in 2010.

There were at least eight mining operations near Ophir in 1949, including two dredges, but $35 gold winnowed them down to none by about 1955. Ophir&#x27;s population was (an estimated) 18 in 1960. There was sporadic mining after that, with new operations starting in the 1970s.

==Demographics==

Ophir first reported on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It continued to report until 1950. Although Donald J. Orth 1967 U.S. Geological Survey (Professional) Paper (Report No. 567) reported an estimated population of 18 in 1960, the census did not report an official separate figure that year or in any census since.

==Geography==
Ophir is located at .

Ophir is located on the west bank of the Innoko River in western Alaska, northwest of McGrath, at the mouth of Ophir Creek, which was mined for many years by Gust Utilla.

<doc id="1062316" wikidata="Q831578" url="?curid=1062316" title="Brazilian cruzeiro real">
<text>The cruzeiro real (formula_1, plural: &quot;cruzeiros reais&quot;) was the short-lived currency of Brazil between August 1, 1993, and June 30, 1994. It was subdivided in 100 centavos; however, this subunit was used only for accounting purposes, and coins and banknotes worth 10 to 500 of the preceding cruzeiro remained valid and were used for the purpose of corresponding to centavos of the cruzeiro real, especially when the redenomination was carried out. The currency had the ISO 4217 code &quot;BRR&quot;.

This redenomination, at the beginning of the second half of 1993, was made with the objective of facilitating the accounting of day-to-day activities, which in the previous unit implied the placement of several zeros that made it difficult to record values in calculators and machines. 

The cruzeiro real was replaced with the current Brazilian real as part of the Plano Real.

==History==
The cruzeiro real replaced the third cruzeiro, with 1,000 cruzeiros = 1 cruzeiro real. The cruzeiro real was replaced in circulation by the real at a rate of 1 real for 2,750 cruzeiros reais. Before this occurred, the unidade real de valor (pegged to the U.S. dollar at parity) was used in pricing, to allow the population to become accustomed to a stable currency (after many years of high inflation) before the real was introduced.

==Coins==
Standard circulation stainless-steel coins were issued in 1993 and 1994 in denominations of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cruzeiros reais. The reverse of the coins portrayed iconic animals of the Brazilian fauna. Coins worth 10 or more of the previous cruzeiro were retained to correspond to smaller denominations, such as the 1,000-cruzeiro coin for a single cruzeiro real, but became scarce by the end of 1993.

No commemorative coins were issued for the Cruzeiro Real.

The macaw and jaguar were represented again in the Real&#x27;s and bills, respectively, after their introduction in 1994, and the maned wolf was later portrayed in the bill since its introduction in late 2020.

==Banknotes==

In 1993, provisional banknotes were introduced in the form of cruzeiro notes overprinted in the new currency. These were in denominations of 50, 100 and 500 cruzeiros reais. Regular notes followed in denominations of 1,000, 5,000 and 50,000 cruzeiros reais. The 10,000 cruzeiros reais banknote was designed and scheduled to be put into circulation in the first months of 1994, but inflation and the impending release of a new economic plan put its release on hold and only the 50,000 Cruzeiro real banknote was released.

<doc id="1062333" wikidata="Q7963015" url="?curid=1062333" title="Walled garden">
<text>A walled garden is a garden enclosed by high walls, especially when this is done for horticultural rather than security purposes, although originally all gardens may have been enclosed for protection from animal or human intruders. In temperate climates, especially colder areas, such as Scotland, the essential function of the walling of a garden is to shelter the garden from wind and frost, though it may also serve a decorative purpose. Kitchen gardens were very often walled, which segregated them socially, allowing the gardeners, who were usually expected to vanish from the &quot;pleasure gardens&quot; when the occupants of the house were likely to be about, to continue their work. The walls, which were sometimes heated, also carried fruit trees trained as espaliers.
Historically, and still in many parts of the world, nearly all urban houses with any private outside space have high walls for security, and any small garden was thus walled by default. The same was true of many rural houses and other buildings, for example religious ones. In palaces and most country houses, the whole plot, including even a very large garden, was also walled or at least fenced, sometimes with (much more expensive) metal railings along those parts of the boundary giving the best views to show off the splendour of the residence, as at the Palace of Versailles, Buckingham Palace and many others. In some cases there was originally a fence or hedging, but a wall was added later when funds allowed. In particular, hiring local labour to build a wall was considered a praiseworthy method of famine relief for the rich, and many walls round the grounds of country houses in the British Isles date to the famine years of the 1840s.

The horticultural, and also social, advantages of a walled garden meant that kitchen gardens often form or formed a walled compand within a larger walled compound. Sometimes this was for the security of the plants; in the 1630s the royal botanical garden of France (now the Jardin des plantes), itself walled all round, had an inner walled-off tulip garden, as the bulbs were valuable and prone to thefts.

Metaphorically, &quot;walled garden&quot; may be used in many contexts (often pejoratively) to indicate a space, usually not a literal physical location, which is or is seen as closed to outsiders. One example is the closed platform in computing.

==Creation of microclimates==

The shelter provided by enclosing walls can raise the ambient temperature within a garden by several degrees, creating a microclimate that permits plants to be grown that would not survive in the unmodified local climate.

Most walls are constructed from stone or brick, which absorb and retain solar heat and then slowly release it, raising the temperature against the wall, allowing peaches, nectarines, and grapes to be grown as espaliers against south-facing walls as far north as southeast Great Britain and southern Ireland.

The ability of a well-designed walled garden to create widely varying stable environments is illustrated by this description of the rock garden in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris&#x27; 5ème arrondissement, where over 2,000 species from a variety of climate zones ranging from mountainous to Mediterranean are grown within a few acres:

===Heated walls===

A number of walled gardens in Britain have a hot wall or fruit wall, a hollow wall with a central cavity, or openings in the wall on the side facing towards the garden, so that fires could be lit inside the wall to provide additional heat to protect the fruit growing against the wall. Heat would escape into the garden through these openings, and the smoke from the fires would be directed upwards through chimneys or flues. This kind of hollow wall is found at Croxteth Hall in Liverpool (England), and Eglinton Country Park and Dunmore House, both in Scotland. At Croome Court an 18th-century cavity wall had a number of small furnaces to supply gentle heat (see below). In the 1800s, such walls were lined with pipes and connected to a boiler, as at Bank Hall in Bretherton.

==Design==
The traditional design of a walled garden, split into four quarters separated by paths, and a wellhead or pool at the centre, dates back to the very earliest gardens of Persia. The &quot;hortus conclusus&quot; or &quot;enclosed garden&quot; of High Medieval Europe was more typically enclosed by hedges or fencing, or the arcades of a cloister; though some protection from weather and effective protection from straying animals was afforded, these were not specifically walled gardens.

===Kitchen gardens===
In the United Kingdom, many country houses had walled kitchen gardens which were distinct from decorative gardens. One acre of a kitchen garden was expected to provide enough produce to feed twelve people, and these gardens ranged in size from one acre up to twenty or thirty acres depending on the size of the household. The largest gardens served extremely large households, for example, the royal kitchen garden at Windsor was built for Queen Victoria in 1844 and initially occupied twenty two acres, but was enlarged to thirty one acres to supply the growing household. Kitchen gardens received their greatest elaboration in the second half of the nineteenth century. Many of these labor-intensive gardens fell into disuse in the twentieth century, but some have been revived as decorative gardens, and others used to produce fruits, vegetables or flowers.

Susan Campbell, in a book devoted to walled kitchen gardens, mentions several factors which contribute to how productive a kitchen garden is. Productivity depended upon the suitability of the situation, and successful gardens depended on the availability of water, manure, heat, wall space, storage space, workrooms, and most importantly, a dedicated team of gardeners.

==Examples==
British examples of walled gardens can be found at Alnwick Castle, Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens, Fulham Palace, Goodnestone Park, Luton Hoo, Osborne House, Polesden Lacey, Shugborough Hall, and Trengwainton Garden in England; Bodysgallen Hall (Wales); Edzell Castle, Muchalls Castle and Myres Castle (Scotland).

The walled kitchen garden at Croome Court, Worcestershire is reputedly the largest 18th-century walled kitchen garden in Europe. It is in private ownership and has been restored by the current owners. In about 1806, a high free-standing east–west hot wall was built, slightly off-centre, serviced by five furnaces; this is historically significant as it is one of the first such structures to be built.

The walled kitchen garden at Chilton Foliat, Wiltshire, was the subject of the 1987 television documentary series &quot;The Victorian Kitchen Garden&quot;.

==In literature==

In the story of Susanna and the Elders, a walled garden is the scene of both an alleged tryst and an attempted rape. Because of the walls, the community is unable to determine which actually occurred.

In John William Waterhouse&#x27;s interpretation of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, Psyche lived in Cupid&#x27;s walled garden.

Much of the storyline of Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; revolves around a walled garden which has been locked for ten years. The author was inspired by Great Maytham Hall in Kent.

&quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne, takes place almost entirely within the confines of a walled garden in which Beatrice, the lovely daughter of a mad scientist, lives alongside gorgeous but lethal flowers.

In &quot;The Last Enchantment&quot;, the third book in Mary Stewart&#x27;s novels of the Arthurian legend, Merlin constructs a heated wall for his garden at Applegarth.

<text>Peter A. Clavelle (born May 10, 1949) is an American politician who served as the 38th and 40th mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and was the first member of a third party to hold the office since James Edmund Burke in 1935. Bernie Sanders also won several elections as an independent candidate in the 1980s (e.g. in 1981, in 1983, in 1985, in 1987), defeating both Republican and Democratic candidates. Sanders and Clavelle founded the Vermont Progressive Party during Sanders&#x27; time as mayor.

==Early life and education==
Peter A. Clavelle was born on May 10, 1949, to Raymond and Eleanor Clavelle in Winooski, Vermont. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in urban studies from Saint Anselm College and a Master of Public Administration from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.

== Career ==
In 1961, he was elected mayor of Winooski for a day by his Boy Scout troop. In 1972 he was appointed as Castleton&#x27;s town manager and in 1976 was appointed as Winooski&#x27;s city manager. During Bernie Sanders&#x27; tenure as mayor of Burlington, Clavelle served as Burlington&#x27;s personnel director and later as director of the Community and Economic Development Office from 1983 to 1989.

=== 1989–1993 mayoral terms ===
Clavelle was elected mayor in 1989 as a Progressive. During the 1993 mayoral election he raised almost twice as much money as his Republican opponent Peter C. Brownell although Brownell was able to take the Burlington police union&#x27;s endorsement from Clavelle. On March 3 Brownell unexpectedly defeated Clavelle with 5,410 votes to 4,686 votes. Clavelle stated that he lost due to the controversy over his proposal (which was passed) to have the city pay for healthcare benefits for domestic partners of city workers.

=== 1995–2006 mayoral terms ===
Clavelle returned to the mayor&#x27;s office two years later in 1995, after defeating Burlington&#x27;s 39th Mayor Peter Brownell. 

The Draft Clavelle for Governor Committee was formed on September 11, 1998, and attempted to gather 1,000 signatures to place Peter Clavelle on the ballot. However, Clavelle announced that he would not run on September 14.

In 2004, Clavelle ran for Governor of Vermont as a Democrat against incumbent Governor Jim Douglas and four other candidates. In order to run in the Democratic Party primary, Clavelle had to change party affiliation, as required by state law. He received the endorsement of five-term former Democratic Governor Howard Dean, but was defeated, 38% to 59%. After Burlington&#x27;s switch to instant-runoff voting in 2005, Clavelle decided not to run in the 2006 election.

Clavelle did not seek re-election to an eighth term as mayor in the 2006 Burlington mayoral election. Bob Kiss succeeded Clavelle as mayor in April 2006.

In 2012, Clavelle moved to Albania as a staff member on a USAID-funded local governance Non Governmental Organization called TetraTech. He returned to Vermont in 2016.

<text>The Polynesian rat, Pacific rat or little rat (Rattus exulans), or , is the third most widespread species of rat in the world behind the brown rat and black rat. Contrary to its vernacular name, the Polynesian rat originated in Southeast Asia, and like its relatives has become widespread, migrating to most of Polynesia, including New Zealand, Easter Island, and Hawaii. It shares high adaptability with other rat species extending to many environments, from grasslands to forests. It is also closely associated with humans, who provide easy access to food. It has become a major pest in most areas of its distribution.

==Description==

The Polynesian rat is similar in appearance to other rats, such as the black rat and the brown rat. It has large, round ears, a pointed snout, black/brown hair with a lighter belly, and comparatively small feet. It has a thin, long body, reaching up to in length from the nose to the base of the tail, making it slightly smaller than other human-associated rats. Where it exists on smaller islands, it tends to be smaller still – . It is commonly distinguished by a dark upper edge of the hind foot near the ankle; the rest of its foot is pale.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Polynesian rat is widespread throughout the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Mitochondrial DNA analysis suggests that the species originated on the island of Flores. The IUCN Red List considers it native to Bangladesh, all of mainland Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, but introduced to all of its Pacific range (including the island of New Guinea), the Philippines, Brunei, and Singapore, and of uncertain origin in Taiwan. It cannot swim over long distances, so is considered to be a significant marker of the human migrations across the Pacific, as the Polynesians accidentally or deliberately introduced it to the islands they settled. The species has been implicated in many of the extinctions that occurred in the Pacific amongst the native birds and insects; these species had evolved in the absence of mammals and were unable to cope with the predation pressures posed by the rat. This rat also may have played a role in the complete deforestation of Easter Island by eating the nuts of the local palm tree &quot;Paschalococos&quot;, thus preventing regrowth of the forest.

Although remains of the Polynesian rat in New Zealand were dated to over 2,000 years old during the 1990s, which was much earlier than the accepted dates for Polynesian migrations to New Zealand, this finding has been challenged by later research showing the rat was introduced to both the country&#x27;s main islands circa 1280.

==Behaviour==
Polynesian rats are nocturnal like most rodents, and are adept climbers, often nesting in trees. In winter, when food is scarce, they commonly strip bark for consumption and satisfy themselves with plant stems. They have common rat characteristics regarding reproduction: polyestrous, with gestations of 21–24 days, litter size affected by food and other resources (6–11 pups), weaning takes around another month at 28 days. They diverge only in that they do not breed year round, instead being restricted to spring and summer.

===Diet===
&quot;R. exulans&quot; is an omnivorous species, eating seeds, fruit, leaves, bark, insects, earthworms, spiders, lizards, and avian eggs and hatchlings. Polynesian rats have been observed to often take pieces of food back to a safe place to properly shell a seed or otherwise prepare certain foods. This not only protects them from predators, but also from rain and other rats. These &quot;husking stations&quot; are often found among trees, near the roots, in fissures of the trunk, and even in the top branches. In New Zealand, for instance, such stations are found under rock piles and fronds shed by nīkau palms.

==Rat control and bird conservation==

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand and its offshore islands, many bird species evolved in the absence of terrestrial mammalian predators, so developed no behavioral defenses to rats. The introduction by the Māori of the Polynesian rat into New Zealand resulted in the eradication of several species of terrestrial and small seabirds.

Subsequent elimination of rats from islands has resulted in substantial increases in populations of certain seabirds and endemic terrestrial birds, as well as species of insects such as the Little Barrier Island giant wētā. As part of its program to restore these populations, such as the critically endangered kākāpō, the New Zealand Department of Conservation undertakes programs to eliminate the Polynesian rat on most offshore islands in its jurisdiction, and other conservation groups have adopted similar programs in other reserves seeking to be predator- and rat-free.

However, two islands in the Hen and Chickens group, Mauitaha and Araara, have now been set aside as sanctuaries for the Polynesian rat.

=== Rest of the Pacific ===
NZAID has funded rat eradication programs in the Phoenix Islands of Kiribati in order to protect the bird species of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area.

Between July and November 2011, a partnership of the Pitcairn Islands Government and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds implemented a poison baiting programme on Henderson Island aimed at eradicating the Polynesian rat. Mortality was massive, but of the 50,000 to 100,000 population, 60 to 80 individuals survived and the population has now fully recovered.

<text>The Bhāgīrathī (Pron: /ˌbʌgɪˈɹɑːθɪ/) is a turbulent Himalayan river in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, and one of the two headstreams of the Ganges, the major river of Northern India and the holy river of Hinduism. In the Hindu faith, history, and culture, the Bhagirathi is considered the source stream of the Ganges. However, in hydrology, the other headstream Alaknanda, is considered the source stream on account of its great length and discharge. The Bhagirathi and Alaknanda join at Devprayag in Garhwal and are thereafter known as the Ganges.

==Etymology==
In Hindu texts, Bhagiratha was a descendant of King Sagara of the Suryavamsha, or Solar Dynasty. He played an important role in the descent of the Ganges. The story of Bhagiratha is narrated in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, and the &quot;Puranas&quot;.

Wanting to show his sovereignty, King Sagara performed a ritual known as ashvamedha, where a horse was left to wander for one year. However, Indra stole the horse to prevent the ritual from being successful. Learning that the horse had disappeared, King Sagara sent his sixty thousand sons to look for it. They eventually found the horse at the ashram of sage Kapila. Thinking that sage Kapila had stolen the horse, the sons interrupted him while he was in deep meditation. This infuriated sage Kapila and with his ascetic&#x27;s gaze burned all sixty thousand sons to ashes. King Sagara sent his grandson, Amshuman, to ask sage Kapila what could be done to bring deliverance to their souls.

Sage Kapila advised that only the water of the Ganges, which flowed in the heavens, could liberate them. Bhagiratha, Amshuman&#x27;s grandson, undertook ascetic practices and won the favour of Brahma and Shiva. Brahma allowed the goddess Ganga to descend upon the earth, while Shiva broke Ganga&#x27;s fall in the coils of his hair so that her force would not shatter the earth.

When Ganga descended, Bhagiratha took her through the mountains, foothills, the plains of India, and to the sea where she liberated the sixty thousand sons of King Sagara. Due to Bhagiratha&#x27;s role in the descent of the Ganges, the source stream came to be known as Bhagirathi.

==Course==
The headwaters of the Bhagirathi River are formed at Gaumukh at the foot of the Gangotri glacier. From Gaumukh the river reaches the town of Gangotri. From Gangotri, it travels down a deep gorge and arrives at Bhaironghati. The river continues to travel to Harsil and crosses the Bhagirathi Granite. It then enters a wide valley and meets two tributaries near Jhala. The river continues to flow downwards to Uttarkashi and then through Dharasu, Chinyalisaur, and the old town of Tehri. From Tehri, the river reaches Devprayag via the Himalayas. At Devprayag, the Bhagirathi River converges with the Alaknanda River and travels onward as the Ganges River.

The Bhagirathi River is mythologically known to be the source stream for the Ganges River. In hydrology, the Alaknanda is the source stream for the Ganges River due to its length and discharge. The Alaknanda River, including its tributaries, is and the Bhagirathi River, including its tributaries, is .

===Tributaries===
The Bhagirathi River is joined by several tributaries; these are, in order from the source: 
*Kedar Ganga at Gangotri (elevation ),
*&quot;Jadh Ganga&quot; at Bhaironghati (elevation ),
*&quot;Kakora Gad&quot; and &quot;Jalandhari Gad&quot; near Harsil (elevation ),
*&quot;Siyan Gad&quot; near Jhala (elevation ),
*&quot;Asi Ganga&quot; near Uttarkashi (elevation ),
*&quot;Bhilangna River&quot; near Old Tehri (elevation ).

The &quot;Bhilangna&quot; itself rises at the foot of the Khatling Glacier (elevation ) approximately south of Gaumukh.

The controversial Tehri dam lies at the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and the Bhilangna, at , near Tehri. Chaukhamba I is the highest point of the Bhagirathi basin.

==Dams==
There are 18 dams along the Bhagirathi River, either in operation, under construction or planned. These are, in order from the source:

<text>Marble Hill House is a Neo-Palladian villa, now Grade I listed, in Twickenham in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It was built between 1724 and 1729 as the home of Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk, who lived there until her death. The compact design soon became famous and furnished a standard model for the Georgian English villa and for plantation houses in the American colonies. 

The estate and house came under ownership of the London County Council and was open to the public in 1903. It was the first eighteenth-century house in England to be preserved by a public body. Restoration by the Greater London Council (GLC) began in 1965 and after the dissolution of the GLC the freehold of the house and estate passed to English Heritage.
==Description==

Marble Hill House was built in 1724–1729 by Henrietta Howard, the mistress of George II, to the designs of the architect Roger Morris (1695–1749) in collaboration with Henry Herbert, 9th Earl of Pembroke, one of the &quot;architect earls&quot;.

Pembroke, then Lord Herbert, based the design of Marble Hill to a large degree on Andrea Palladio&#x27;s 1553 Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese, Italy, and thus incorporated a cubic saloon on the first floor or &quot;piano nobile&quot;. &quot;Villa Cornaro&quot; also served as a model for plantation houses in the American colonies, examples being Drayton Hall (1738–1742) in Charleston, South Carolina, and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s initial version of Monticello (1768–1770). It was in other respects an adaptation of a more expansive design by Colen Campbell. It is set in 66 acres (2.67 km2) of parkland known as Marble Hill Park. The &quot;Great Room&quot; contains lavishly gilded decoration and five capricci paintings by Giovanni Paolo Pannini. Marble Hill House also contains a loaned collection of early Georgian furniture and paintings as well as the Chinoiserie collection of the Lazenby Bequest.

It was located a few miles away from Kendal House, another Palladian property built around the same time for a royal mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal who had been the long-term lover of George I.

Both Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift were regular guests at the house during the lifetime of Henrietta Howard.

In the late 18th century the house was rented by the Prince Regent (the future George IV) for his mistress, Maria Fitzherbert, so the two could continue to meet in private.
Marble Hill House soon became known from published engravings, and it was widely admired for its plan and tightly controlled elevations. Its design was much copied elsewhere, after 1750, and provided a standard model for the English villas built throughout the Thames Valley and further afield, an early example being at New Place, King&#x27;s Nympton, Devon, built between 1746 and 1749 to the design of Francis Cartwright of Blandford in Dorset.
An archaeological investigation found evidence of what has been described as a bowling alley next to the house in 2017. However, it is likely that game resembled boules as much as bowling and the &quot;alley&quot; (better described as a depression in the ground) does not resemble the modern concept of a bowling alley. The main evidence that the area was used for some sort of bowling rests on contemporary plans.

The house is now owned by English Heritage, which acquired it in 1986 following the abolition of the Greater London Council. Its extensive grounds are known as Marble Hill Park and provide many leisure facilities including rugby and hockey pitches, a cricket pitch and nets, tennis courts, and a children&#x27;s play area.

In 2015, English Heritage won a Heritage Lottery Fund grant to develop Marble Hill House and its park in order to improve its presentation and the associated leisure facilities. As part of this project Historic England made a range of landscape investigations, including geophysical surveys, aerial photography and lidar mapping, analytical earthwork survey, coring and vegetation analysis to create a clear picture of the development of the Marble Hill landscape from the 17th century onwards. Restoration work on the house included the reinstatement of Georgian colour schemes and renovation of the furnishings and pictures. The works took seven years to complete and cost £8M. The chief executive officer of English Heritage, Kate Mavor, described the restored house as “one of the forgotten gems of Georgian London”.

==In popular culture==
Marble Hill House is used as a stand-in for a plantation house in the 1994 film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;.

<text>The Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design (HfG) is a state art college founded in 1992 in Karlsruhe, Germany. It focuses on media art, communication design, product design, exhibition design and scenography, art research, and media philosophy, with a strong interdisciplinarity between the departments. The university has about 400 students.

== History ==
The university was opened on 15 April 1992 as a reform college in Karlsruhe. Together with the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe (ZKM) it was founded during the years 1989 to 1992 by Heinrich Klotz. This combination of teaching, research and exhibition institutions corresponds to the self-imposed artistic and pedagogical task of relating the traditional arts to media technology and electronic manufacturing processes.

Classical forms such as painting were only represented with a professorship until 2004. Interdisciplinary work should be promoted by linking artistic, applied and theoretical courses. With bringing together media art, art theory and design Klotz wanted to found an &quot;electronic Bauhaus&quot;. Since 1997, the HfG Karlsruhe as well as the ZKM is housed in a listed former ammunition factory.

After the death of Klotz in 1999, Gunter Rambow took over the provisional management of the university. In early 2001, Peter Sloterdijk was appointed rector, which he remained until his retirement in 2015. After a transitional phase under Deputy Rector Volker Albus, Siegfried Zielinski&#x27;s term of office began in February 2016. In December 2017 according to own information Zilinski asked the Minister of Science, Research and Art Baden-Württemberg for the early termination of his contract. As a reason, he stated that his reform ideas were not enforceable. Since 1 April 2018 Johan F. Hartle has taken over the position of acting Rector at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design.

== Study ==
The interdisciplinary framework of the early years is still being preserved by the four practical departments

* Exhibition Design and Scenography,
* Communication Design,
* Media Art and
* Product Design
as well as the theoretical department
* Art Research and Media Philosophy

Common to all degree courses is the project work practiced from the beginning, as well as continued cooperation with the neighboring ZKM. In-house workshops and studios were also set up for the practice-oriented training of the HfG students.

For the students of the theoretical subjects the choice of a practical secondary subject is obligatory. The students of the practical subjects are obliged to study a theory subject such as art research or media philosophy as a minor subject. The four practical study programs of the HfG Karlsruhe are permeable fields of study, which allow intensive connections to other subjects and, depending on the research and development focus of the specific university teacher, receive different emphases. The media-theoretical analysis permeates the practical events, on the other hand, the media-theoretical and art-research training is concretized by an immediate practical relevance.

Prerequisite for admission to the program is the general or subject-related higher education entrance qualification as well as the successful completion of an entrance examination.

== Degree ==
At the HfG Karlsruhe, no Bachelor/Master programs are offered, as from the first semester on the project study with contents that can not be modularized, is practiced. The HfG Karlsruhe still awards the internationally recognized diploma or Magister&#x27;s degree. On the basis of the Magister&#x27;s degree a doctorate (Dr. phil.) in art theory, media theory and philosophy is also possible. The international Bologna compatibility of HfG degrees is guaranteed. In 2008, the Wissenschaftsrat certified the HfG Karlsruhe an &quot;excellent training concept&quot; in its evaluation report.

<text>The ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe (until March 2016: ZKM Center for Art and Media Technology), a cultural institution, was founded in 1989 and, since 1997, is located in a former munitions factory in Karlsruhe, Germany. The ZKM (German: Zentrum für Kunst und Medien) organizes special exhibitions and thematic events, conducts research and produces works on the effects of media, digitization, and globalization, and offers public as well as individualized communications and educational programs.

The ZKM houses under one roof exhibition spaces, the research platform Hertz Lab, a library and a media library, thus combining research and production, exhibitions and events, archive and collection. The ZKM operates at the interface of art and science, and addresses new knowledge in the area of new technologies to develop it further. After the death of founding director (1935–1999), the ZKM was directed by Peter Weibel (1999–2023), later together with . Besides the ZKM, the former munitions factory also houses the associated Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design, and the [Municipal Art Gallery of Karlsruhe].

== Mission ==
&quot;The mission of the ZKM is to explore the creative possibilities of connecting the traditional arts and media technologies to achieve innovative results. The goal is to enrich the arts, not to amputate them by technical means. This is why traditional art and media art must compete with one another. The ZKM is a place which supports both – each for itself and together. The Bauhaus, founded in Weimar in 1919, can be regarded as its model.&quot; – Heinrich Klotz 

The ZKM&#x27;s mission as formulated by founding director Heinrich Klotz in 1992 was implemented and developed further in the years that followed. Today, following guiding ideas mainly inform the work of the ZKM:

* The ZKM is a location for all forms of contemporary art.
* As a center for research and development on theory and practice, the ZKM brings together artists, scholars, and scientists from a variety of disciplines.
* Through collecting and safeguarding works of art and historical equipment, as well as building a comprehensive archive of twentieth and twenty-first century arts, the ZKM is a preserver of cultural heritage. Here, the conservation of &quot;digital art&quot; is accorded special importance.

== History ==

The founding of the Center for Art and Media goes back to the early 1980s. In the context of an ever-expanding media landscape and a changing art world, representatives from local government, the University of Karlsruhe, the University of Music Karlsruhe, the Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe [Center for Nuclear Research Karlsruhe] and other institutions, as well as organizations and representatives of the Karlsruhe art scene formed the ZKM Project Group in 1986. In February 1988 the ZKM Project Group presented the results of their work, titled Concept ‘88, which described the initiative to bring the arts and the new media together in both theory and practice.

With the founding of a board of trustees in 1989 and the appointment of Heinrich Klotz as founding director, the ZKM became a concrete reality. Three dates mark the ZKM&#x27;s foundation: the local council&#x27;s resolution dated May 9, 1989; the decision by the Council of Ministers of the State of Baden-Württemberg dated 3 June 1989; and the entry into force of its statutes on 12 August 1989. To begin with, the ZKM occupied various buildings around the city. Prior to moving to its present location, the ZKM&#x27;s media art festival MultiMediale (MultiMediale 1–5, 1989–1997) was held at changing locations.

For a considerable time, the ZKM&#x27;s future permanent location was envisaged in an area to the south of Karlsruhe Central Station. An international architecture competition for a new building on the site was announced in March 1989, from which a visionary design by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas resulted. However, construction of the so-called Koolhaas-Cube was abandoned in 1992 for reasons of costs and space and instead, a disused factory building would be converted. Karlsruhe Council opted for repurposing Hallenbau A [Hall A], built 1914–1918 by architect Philipp Jakob Manz as a weapons and munitions factory, which was then an industrial ruin. The building, 312 meters long and divided into ten atria, was on the former factory site of the Industriewerke Karlsruhe-Augsburg (IWKA), which had been an industrial brownfields since the 1970s in the south-west of Karlsruhe that separated the city center from the surrounding urban areas. The conversion, based on plans drawn up by the Hamburg office of Schweger Architects, and the construction of the blue Cube annex inspired by Koolhaas&#x27;s original design, commenced in 1993. When the ZKM moved to its new premises in 1997 it had studios and institutes for research and production (Institute for Visual Media, Institute for Music and Acoustics), a media theater, spaces for concerts and events, a media center, a Mediathek, and a Media Museum. In the second construction phase, the rooms housing the Museum of Contemporary Art (moved in 1999) and the associated Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design (moved in 2001) were completed. From 2004 to 2005 the formerly independent Museum of Contemporary Art was reintegrated into the ZKM. In March 2016 the ZKM Center for Art and Media Technology changed its name to ZKM Center for Art and Media.

=== ZKM | Media Museum ===
The central concerns of the Media Museum turn on the history and critique of the new media, which have been transforming the forms of everyday life for the past 50 years. Computer, telephone and Internet intervene in social and individual lives in that technical components become increasingly important. A further focus of the Media Museum is the interaction between observer and work of art: only through the actions and reactions of every single visitor do works actually emerge – the visitor itself becomes an element in the installation and, in this way, is able to explore the treatment with new technologies. With works of media art and interactive installations artists and scientists question media-technological developments and visions. Temporary exhibitions, such as &quot;net_condition. Art/Politics in the Online Universe&quot; (September 1999 to February 2000), &quot;Iconoclash. Beyond Image Wars in Science, Religion and Art&quot; (from May to September, 2002) or &quot;bit international&quot; (February 2008 to January 2009) were highly respected both nationally and abroad.

=== ZKM | Museum of Contemporary Art ===
Since December 1999, the Museum of Contemporary Art has been located in the atrium 1 and 2 of the former munitions factory. Across 7.000 sqm exhibition space, the museum displays works from private collections, namely the FER COLLECTION, the Sammlung Grässlin [Grässlin Collection], the Sammlung Siegfried Weishaupt [Weishaupt Collection], the collection of the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, VAF-Stiftung / Museo di arte moderna e contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto [VAF Foundation / Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto] (MART), as well as the Boros Collection, together with exponents drawn from the ZKM Collection and further collaborating collections. Temporary exhibitions, above all from the second half of the twentieth centuries through to contemporary approaches in contemporary art are presented. Among others monographic exhibitions, on Bruce Nauman, Bill Viola, Sigmar Polke, Franz West, Sylvie Fleury, Martin Kippenberger and Tobias Rehberger have been taking place since 1999. Special, thematic exhibitions were, inter alia &quot;Making Things Public. Atmospheres of Democracy&quot; (March to October, 2005), &quot;Light Art from Artificial Light&quot; (November 2005 to August 2006), &quot;Medium Religion&quot; (November 2008 till April 2009) or &quot;The Global Contemporary. Art Worlds after 1989&quot; (September 2011 to February 2012). Furthermore, smaller scale exhibitions are held in the museum project spaces.

=== Events ===
The form and content of events vary: from opera with multimedial stages to scientific symposia and popular concerts through to performances, dance or film-screenings. Here, the ZKM functions both as an organizer and cooperation partner, but also leases out its facilities. The events take place in various spaces, among others, the Lecture Hall, the Media Theater, the Foyer and the ZKM_Cube.

Every year, on 6 January, the ZKM and the Städtische Galerie hold an Open Day where admission is free of charge.
=== Exhibitions ===
Since 1989 the ZKM | Karlsruhe has been mounting exhibitions – interactive, participatory, and performative – as well as producing the accompanying publications. In changing thematic and monographic exhibitions organized in the ZKM&#x27;s 15,000 m2 exhibition spaces, contemporary developments in art and society are presented in all types of media and using all kinds of methods.

Together with the research facilities, the labs and departments of the ZKM, as well as partner institutions and research facilities from all over the world, the curatorial department develops the ZKM&#x27;s diverse exhibition program in close collaboration with the board of directors and an international network of guest artists, scholars, scientists, and curators.

The ZKM is involved in a large number of international collaborative projects, which enables the ZKM&#x27;s exhibitions and their content to be made available to a global audience. The own exhibitions curated by the ZKM are regularly presented internationally. In 2018, 20 ZKM exhibitions were on show at locations around the world, including in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, the Philippines, India, South Korea, and China.
In 2018, CryptoKitties was used by the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe to showcase blockchain technology.

=== Events ===
Alongside the exhibitions, events take place as platforms for exchanging opinions and information with visitors and figures from various spheres of social life such as politics, the economy, and philosophy. The form and content of the events vary: from opera with a multimedia stage, scientific symposia, and popular concerts to performances, dance, and film screenings. Here, the ZKM functions both as an organizer and collaboration partner, and also as a contact for leasing out its facilities. The events take place in various spaces, for example, the Lecture Hall, the Media Theater, the Foyer, and the ZKM Cube.

Since 2014 the Gulash Programming Night has been held at the ZKM and the HfG. This four-day conference of the German and international hacker scene is organized by the Karlsruhe branch of the Chaos Computer Club. The ZKM contributes lectures to Gulash Programming Night event and organizes special tours.

From 2011 to 2017 the ZKM conferred the AppArtAward annually together with Cyberforum e.V., CAS Software AG, and other partners. The AppArtAward was conferred on apps that are artworks and combine creative aspects and use of technological possibilities. The competition had various categories, each with a prize of €10,000. Categories included Prize for Artistic Innovation, Special Prize for Crowd Art, and Special Prize for Art and Science.

== Research and production ==
The ZKM&#x27;s research institutes develop transdisciplinary projects. Research is partly conducted by the ZKM, and partly in collaboration with other education and research institutions. The goal is to analyze and trial the latest technologies to determine their applicability and relevance for art and the information society, which is increasingly connected on a global scale and communicates online.

=== Hertz Lab ===
The Hertz Lab was established in 2017. It combines the Institute for Visual Media and the Institute for Music and Acoustics.

The main activities of the Hertz Lab are art production and research on media technology. Contemporary concepts – for example, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) in virtual reality (VR) and AR applications, immersive or sensor-based environments, and investigating the artistic potential of electromagnetic fields – are considered across genres and media, examined in terms of their artistic applicability, and realized in productions.

The name Hertz Lab refers to the German physicist Heinrich Hertz.

== Archives and collections ==

The ZKM Collection was founded by the ZKM&#x27;s first director, Heinrich Klotz, in the early 1990s and has been added to ever since. The collection is based on a specific approach to the different art genres and media: whereas painting and sculpture were hermetically sealed off from the new influences of video art and photography which were gradually establishing themselves, the ZKM&#x27;s collecting activity is distinguished by transcending such traditional genre divisions. While the Museum of Contemporary Art&#x27;s collection contained artworks of all genres from the very beginning, the Media Museum&#x27;s collection initially only contained works of interactive media art most of which were produced in-house. Over 500 international guest artists produced a vast number of works at the ZKM, which entered the ZKM Collection after their initial presentation in Karlsruhe. Consequently, the ZKM has one of the largest collections of media art in the world, extending back to the beginning of video art, electronic installations, and holography. In addition to these there is the collection of approximately 1,200 art videos and 13,800 audio tracks, which are not stored in the museum, but can be accessed via the ZKM | Media Library.

The Video Collection was one of the first of its kind in Germany, and helped to raise public awareness of video as an independent art form. The collection contains works of video art from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and other works, such as the video magazine &quot;Infermental&quot;. Through the work of the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems, which is connected to the Media Library, it has been possible to rescue extensive video collections in Europe and the US from degenerating, and make them accessible to the public.

The Audio Collection contains contemporary music with an emphasis on electroacoustic music. In addition to audio recordings, the collection includes scores, specialist publications, historic photographs, and posters. Of especial importance is the International Digital Electro-acoustic Music Archive (IDEAMA), which includes pieces of electro-acoustic music from its beginnings through to the present.

In addition to works of video art and electronic music, the ZKM acquires archives and documents on the electronic arts, that is, on video art, electroacoustic music, computer art, and inter-media art forms.

The joint library of the ZKM and the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design (HfG) has holdings of approximately 60,000 books, journals, and digital storage media. Thematically, it concentrates on twentieth and twenty-first century art and, first and foremost, on media art, architecture, design, media theory, film, photography, and electroacoustic music. The library&#x27;s entire holdings can be researched via the Internet.

== Publications ==
In collaboration with publishers, the ZKM publishes exhibition catalogs and specialist works on the monographic and thematic exhibitions.

<text>Stefan Marian Kaczmarz (20 March 1895 – 1939) was a Polish mathematician. His Kaczmarz method provided the basis for many modern imaging technologies, including the CAT scan.

Kaczmarz was a professor of mathematics in the faculty of mechanical engineering of Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów from 1919 to 1939, where he collaborated with Stefan Banach.

The circumstances of Kaczmarz&#x27;s death are unclear. In early September 1939, after World War II broke out, he was called up for Polish military service as a reserve lieutenant. He sent a letter to his wife on 4 September and was not heard from afterwards. Theories for his death include the possibility that he died soon after near Nisko (the source of his last letter to his wife) in a German bombing raid on a train he was traveling in, that he died later that month in combat against the Germans near Umiastów, or that he was murdered by the NKVD in April or May 1940 as part of the Katyń massacre.

<doc id="1062406" wikidata="Q7622000" url="?curid=1062406" title="Stratford and Moreton Tramway">
<text>The Stratford and Moreton Tramway was a 16-mile (25-km) long horse-drawn wagonway which ran from the canal basin at Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire to Moreton-in-Marsh in Gloucestershire, with a branch to Shipston-on-Stour. The main line opened in 1826, whilst the branch to Shipston opened in 1836.

The tramway was used to carry Black Country coal to the rural districts of southern Warwickshire via the Stratford-on-Avon Canal, and limestone and agricultural produce northwards. 

The northern part of the tramway had fallen into disuse by the early 1900s and was dismantled in 1918. The southern section between Moreton-in-Marsh and Shipston-on-Stour was converted into a steam railway in 1889 and continued in use as a minor branch line until 1960.

==Background==

The act of Parliament for the line, the (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. lxiii), was passed in 1821 and construction was completed in 1826, the route having been surveyed by the railway promoter William James and engineered by John Urpeth Rastrick.

The tramway was built as part of an early and ambitious scheme known as the Central Junction Railway promoted by William James, to link the Midlands with London via canal between Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon, tramway to Oxford, and finally by river barge down the River Thames to London. However, only part of this route, to Moreton-in-Marsh, and one of the three planned branches was ever built. Sources disagree on the gauge of the tramway; several cite a gauge of , while one states it was built to the gauge adopted by George Stephenson in the north-east of England.
The branch to Shipston-on-Stour, was authorised by the (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. lxx) on 10 June 1833, and opened on 11 February 1836. 

==Operational history==
Goods traffic was conveyed by licensed carriers in their own wagons. They could also purchase a further licence costing £12 per annum, to carry passengers.

By 1829, the tramway was making an operating profit, although the profits were not sufficient to pay off the considerable debts which the tramway had accrued.

The steam hauled Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&amp;WR) opened in 1853 serving Moreton-in-Marsh with a new railway station, which severed the terminal buildings from the branch. This had compelled the OW&amp;WR to take over the tramway on a perpetual lease from 1 May 1847. The OW&amp;WR itself became part of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1863. The OW&amp;WR upgraded the line all the way to Stratford to carry main-line wagons, albeit still horse-drawn, as the original act of Parliament forbade the use of steam locomotives; although this enabled some through traffic to operate, it did not do much to improve the fortunes of the line, and in 1859 the OW&amp;WR opened a branch to Stratford from which took most of the through traffic, and which ended any hopes of the tramway becoming a financial success. Although the tramway continued to carry some traffic, by 1904, the northern section of the tramway to Stratford had become disused, and the tracks were lifted in 1918 as a wartime economy measure. The line was formally abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1926, exactly 100 years after it had been opened.

The southern portion of the tramway between Moreton and Shipston-on-Stour however lasted longer: The GWR upgraded the line to allow it to be converted it into a conventional steam railway; to do this they had to obtain an act of Parliament to allow the use of steam locomotives. The line reopened in its new form on 1 July 1889 with locomotive operation, It therefore became the Shipston-on-Stour branch of the Great Western Railway. The sharp curves of the tramway alignment made it a slow journey. A passenger service of four trains each way per-day operated until 8 July 1929. Goods operation continued until closure on 2 May 1960.

==Remains==
The most prominent remaining piece of infrastructure, is the tramway&#x27;s brick arch bridge across the River Avon at Stratford, which remains in use as a public footbridge, and is still known as the Tramway Bridge.

One of the horse-drawn wagons, which belonged to Thomas Hutchings of Newbold Lime Works, is preserved a short distance north of the Tramway Bridge, near the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-on-Avon, which sits on a short stretch of preserved tramway track on stone blocks. Newbold Lime Works would have been at Newbold on Stour.

Another old coal wagon from the tramway is preserved at the National Railway Museum at York. This dates from c. 1840, and was formerly used by Thomas James, Coal Merchant, Shipston-on-Stour.

==Uses since closure==
In 2020, as a result of more people walking and cycling during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Community Interest Company called Old Tramway Revived was set up with the aim to reopen more of the old tramway route south from Stratford-upon-Avon alongside the A3400 as an active transportation corridor towards Shipston. The company has already received support from several of the local councils, and in a presentation to the Stratford Society it was noted that there was a previous abandoned attempt to reopen the route in the mid 1980s that used Manpower Services Commission labour to clear some of the line.

<text>Brooks is a city in southeast Alberta, Canada in the County of Newell. It is on Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) and the Canadian Pacific Kansas City railway, approximately southeast of Calgary, and northwest of Medicine Hat. The city has an elevation of .

== History ==
The area that is now Brooks was used as a bison-hunting ground for the Blackfoot and Crow tribes. After Treaty 7 was signed in 1877, homesteaders took advantage of the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; to move into the area to begin farming. Before 1904, the area still did not have a name. Through a contest sponsored by the Postmaster General, the area was named after Noel Edgell Brooks, a Canadian Pacific Railway Divisional Engineer from Calgary.

Brooks was incorporated as a village on July 14, 1910, and then as a town on September 8, 1911. Its population in the 1911 Census of Canada was 486.

In the 1996 Census, the population of Brooks reached 10,093 making it eligible for city status. Brooks incorporated as a city on September 1, 2005 when its official population was 11,604.

In 2010, Brooks celebrated the centennial of its incorporation as a village in 1910.

== Demographics ==

A multicultural community, Brooks has been referred to as &quot;The City of 100 Hellos&quot; as a result of a documentary by Brandy Yanchyk profiling the community&#x27;s significant immigrant, refugee and temporary foreign worker populations. The documentary was called &quot;Brooks – The City of 100 Hellos&quot; and was created in 2010 for Omni Television. The community&#x27;s multicultural character was also the subject of a 2007 National Film Board of Canada documentary, &quot;24 Days in Brooks&quot;, directed by Dana Inkster. Brooks has the highest proportion of Black Canadians of any census subdivision in Canada.


== Geography ==

Brooks is located in the Grassland Natural Region of Alberta. The area surrounding Brooks is dry mixed grass/shortgrass prairie.

=== Climate ===
Located in the steppe region known as the Palliser&#x27;s Triangle, Brooks has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;&quot;BSk&quot;&quot;). Winters are quite dry and cold, with little snowfall compared to the rest of Canada. Chinook winds, though less common than in areas west and especially southwest of Brooks, are still common and ameliorate the cold winter temperatures temporarily when they pass over. Wide diurnal temperature ranges are regular, due to the aridity and moderately high elevation. Low humidity is prevalent throughout the year. Most of the relatively scant annual precipitation occurs in late spring and summer, often in the form of thunderstorms. On average, the coldest month is January, with an average temperature of while the warmest is July, with an average temperature of . The driest month is February, with an average monthly precipitation of , while the wettest month is June, with an average of . Annual precipitation is low, with an average of .

Canada’s second largest beef-processing facility, owned by JBS Canada, is located in Brooks and ships meat across the country and internationally. In 2012, while the plant was owned by XL Foods, it released meat contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot;, and was shut down for a month. The plant has over 2000 employees.

== Attractions ==
The JBS Leisure Centre is the area&#x27;s main recreation centre. It includes one arena, a curling rink, an aquatic centre with a waterslide and wave pool, a gymnasium, a fitness centre, and multipurpose rooms. The complex was renovated in 2005 and again in 2016. Now the Brooks Public Library is within the JBS Leisure Centre.

In 2010, the Duke of Sutherland Park was redeveloped. It features baseball diamonds, a soccer field, a playground and a waterpark with spray features for toddlers and a play structure for older children.

Also in 2010, the Centennial Regional Arena was completed after nearly a decade of planning and 18 months of construction. The multi-purpose facility seats 1,704 people. It includes corporate boxes, a running track, concessions, and a surface. The arena is home to several user groups, including the Brooks Bandits. The arena also hosted the 2019 National Junior A Championship.

There are three provincial parks in the area: Dinosaur Provincial Park, a World Heritage Site, to the northeast, Tillebrook Provincial Park to the east and Kinbrook Island Provincial Park to the south. In addition, there are several other recreational sites in the area including the Rolling Hills Reservoir, Crawling Valley Reservoir, and Emerson Bridge.

The Brooks Aqueduct southeast of Brooks was built to transport irrigation water across the Eastern Irrigation District. It spans across a valley, about above the ground.

<doc id="1062412" wikidata="Q480977" url="?curid=1062412" title="Absolutely Live (The Doors album)">
<text>Absolutely Live is the first live album by the American rock band the Doors, released on July 20, 1970, by Elektra Records. The double album features songs recorded at concerts held in 1969 and 1970 in several U.S. cities. It includes the first full release of the performance piece &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; and several other tracks that had not previously appeared on any official Doors release. The album peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in September 1970.

==Recording==

Many shows were recorded during the band&#x27;s 1970 Roadhouse Blues Tour to create the &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; album. The Doors&#x27; producer and longtime collaborator Paul A. Rothchild claimed to have painstakingly edited the album from many different shows to create one cohesive concert. According to Rothchild, the best part of a song from one performance may have been spliced together with another part of the same song from another performance, in an attempt to create &quot;the ultimate concert&quot;. Rothchild said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get complete takes of a lot of songs, so sometimes I&#x27;d cut from Detroit to Philadelphia in mid-song. There must be 2,000 edits on that album.&quot; However, most of the tracks were taken from the Doors&#x27; performances at the Felt Forum in New York City on January 17 and 18, 1970.

&quot;Absolutely Live&quot; marks the first release of the Doors&#x27; performance piece &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; in its entirety, which had originally been attempted in the studio during the &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; sessions but was eventually abandoned. The album also included several new songs: &quot;Love Hides&quot;, &quot;Build Me a Woman&quot;, &quot;Universal Mind&quot;, &quot;Dead Rats, Dead Cats&quot; (performed as a preamble to &quot;Break on Through&quot;) and cover versions of Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; and Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Close to You&quot; (the latter featuring lead vocals by keyboardist Ray Manzarek).

Reflecting on the live album in an interview, Jim Morrison remarked, &quot;I think [&quot;Absolutely Live&quot; is] a fairly true document of what the band sounds like on fairly good night. It&#x27;s not the best we can do and it&#x27;s certainly not the worst. It&#x27;s a true document of an above average evening.&quot; In his autobiography, Manzarek explained the group&#x27;s intentions with the album: &quot;We wanted to get the Doors experience on tape. Live. One time. For the ages. And in doing so, perhaps we could capture the moment of escape. Live.&quot;

==Album cover==
According to the biography &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, Morrison hated the album cover for &quot;Absolutely Live&quot;. He had changed his appearance dramatically since the band&#x27;s early days, growing a beard and discarding his onstage leather attire in an attempt to overcome his &quot;rock god&quot; image, but was dismayed to find that his record label opted for an earlier photograph of him for the cover.

In his book &quot;Krautrocksampler&quot;, the British rock musician and writer Julian Cope described the photo of Morrison as one of his &quot;two favorite all-time images of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singers&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Absolutely Live&quot; sold only 225,000 copies, half of what their previous studio album &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; had sold. Critic Gloria Vanjak of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote a scathing review of the album, singling out Morrison&#x27;s performance in particular and referring to &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; as &quot;rancid&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave a more favorable review, praising its &quot;strong performances and audio,&quot; but concluded that &quot;I don&#x27;t happen to be into reptiles when the music&#x27;s over, much less while it&#x27;s on.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann observed that the album &quot;demonstrated that, in concert, the Doors could be an enervating as well as an elevating experience.&quot; However, he bemoaned the fact that Morrison seemed to &quot;treat the whole exercise as a charade&quot; and opined that several tracks &quot;flag considerably in comparison to the sleeker studio versions.&quot; Writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, critic Max Bell praised the album, noting that it remains the &quot;organic documentary&quot; that the band envisaged.

Julian Casablancas of the Strokes has cited the album track &quot;Universal Mind&quot; as a personal favorite of his. 

===Reissues===
In 1991, &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; was issued on compact disc as part of the two-CD set &quot;In Concert&quot;, which also included the Doors&#x27; live albums &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot; and &quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;. &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; was later reissued as a single CD by Elektra in 1996, featuring new artwork different from the original LP. In 2010, it was reissued on 180 gram vinyl by Rhino Records in its original double LP format and featuring its original artwork, in both the U.S. and UK.

<doc id="1062425" wikidata="Q736380" url="?curid=1062425" title="Mark Kac">
<text>Mark Kac ( ; Polish: &quot;Marek Kac&quot;; August 3, 1914 – October 26, 1984) was a Polish-American mathematician. His main interest was probability theory. His question, &quot;Can one hear the shape of a drum?&quot; set off research into spectral theory, the idea of understanding the extent to which the spectrum allows one to read back the geometry. In the end, the answer was generally &quot;no&quot;.

==Early life and education==
He was born to a Polish-Jewish family; their town, Kremenets (Polish: &quot;Krzemieniec&quot;), changed hands from the Russian Empire (by then Soviet Ukraine) to Poland after the Peace of Riga, when Kac was a child.

Kac completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Polish University of Lwów in 1937 under the direction of Hugo Steinhaus. While there, he was a member of the Lwów School of Mathematics. 

After receiving his degree, he began to look for a position abroad, and in 1938 was granted a scholarship from the Parnas Foundation, which enabled him to go work in the United States. He arrived in New York City in November 1938.

With the onset of World War II in Europe, Kac was able to stay in the United States, while his parents and brother, who had remained in Kremenets, were murdered by the Nazis in mass executions in August 1942.

==Career==
===Cornell University===
From 1939 to 1961, Kac taught at Cornell University, an Ivy League university in Ithaca, New York, where he was first an instructor. In 1943, he was appointed an assistant professor, and he became a full professor in 1947. 

While a professor at Cornell, he became a naturalized US citizen in 1943. From 1943 to 1945, he also worked with George Uhlenbeck at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. During the 1951–1952 academic year, Kac was on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study. 

In 1952, Kac, with Theodore H. Berlin, introduced the spherical model of a ferromagnet, a variant of the Ising model, and, with J. C. Ward, found an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method. 

In 1956, he introduced a simplified mathematical model known as the Kac ring, which features the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from completely time-symmetric microscopic laws. Using the model as an analogy to molecular motion, he provided an explanation for Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox.

===Rockefeller University===
In 1961, Kac left Cornell and went to The Rockefeller University in New York City. 

He worked with George Uhlenbeck and P. C. Hemmer on the mathematics of a van der Waals gas. After twenty years at Rockefeller, he moved to the University of Southern California where he spent the rest of his career.

In his 1966 article, &quot;Can one hear the shape of the drum&quot;, Kac asked whether the geometric shape of a drum is uniquely defined by its sound. The answer was negative, meaning two different resonators can have identical set of eigenfrequencies.

===Human rights===
Kac was the co-chair of the Committee of Concerned Scientists. He co-authored a letter, which publicized the case of the scientist Vladimir Samuilovich Kislik and a letter which publicized the case of the applied mathematician Yosif Begun.

==Awards and honors==
* 1950 — Chauvenet Prize for 1947 expository article
* 1959 – member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
* 1965 – member of the National Academy of Sciences
* 1968 – Chauvenet Prize (and 1967 Lester R. Ford Award) for 1966 expository article
* 1969 – member of the American Philosophical Society
* 1971 – Solvay Lecturer at Brussels
* 1980 – Fermi Lecturer at the Scuola Normale, Pisa

<doc id="1062429" wikidata="Q178564" url="?curid=1062429" title="Nationalization">
<text>Nationalization (nationalisation in British English) 
is the process of transforming privately owned assets into public assets by bringing them under the public ownership of a national government or state. Nationalization contrasts with privatization and with demutualization. When previously nationalized assets are privatized and subsequently returned to public ownership at a later stage, they are said to have undergone renationalization (or deprivatization). Industries often subject to nationalization include telecommunications, electric power, fossil fuels, railways, airlines, iron ore, media, postal services, banks, and water (sometimes called the commanding heights of the economy), and in many jurisdictions such entities have no history of private ownership.

Nationalization may occur with or without financial compensation to the former owners. Nationalization is distinguished from property redistribution in that the government retains control of nationalized property. Some nationalizations take place when a government seizes property acquired illegally. For example, in 1945 the French government seized the car-maker Renault because its owners had collaborated with the 1940–1944 Nazi occupiers of France.

Economists distinguish between nationalization and socialization, which refers to the process of restructuring the economic framework, organizational structure, and institutions of an economy on a socialist basis. By contrast, nationalization does not necessarily imply social ownership and the restructuring of the economic system. Historically, states have carried out nationalizations for various different purposes under a wide variety of different political systems and economic systems.

== Political support ==

Nationalization was one of the major mechanisms advocated by reformist socialists and social democrats for gradually transitioning to socialism. In this context, the goals of nationalization were to dispossess large capitalists, redirect the profits of industry to the public purse, and establish some form of workers&#x27; self-management as a precursor to the establishment of a socialist economic system.

Although sometimes undertaken as part of a strategy to build socialism, more commonly nationalization was also undertaken and used to protect and develop industries perceived as being vital to a nation&#x27;s competitiveness (such as aerospace and shipbuilding), or to protect jobs in certain industries.

Nationalization has had varying levels of support throughout history. After the Second World War, nationalization was supported by social democratic and democratic socialist parties throughout Western Europe, such as the British Labour Party. In the United States, potentially nationalizing healthcare is often a topic of political disagreement and makes frequent appearances in debates between political candidates. A 2020 poll shows that a majority (63%) of Americans support a nationalized healthcare system.

A re-nationalization occurs when state-owned assets are privatized and later nationalized again, often when a different political party or faction is in power. A re-nationalization process may also be called &quot;reverse privatization&quot;. Nationalization has been used to refer to either direct state-ownership and management of an enterprise or to a government acquiring a large controlling share of a publicly listed corporation.

According to research by Paasha Mahdavi, leaders who consider nationalization face a dilemma: &quot;nationalize and reap immediate gains while risking future prosperity, or maintain private operations, thereby passing on revenue windfalls but securing long-term fiscal streams.&quot; He argues that leaders &quot;nationalize extractive resources to extend the duration of their power&quot; by using &quot;this increased capital to secure political support.&quot;

== Economic analysis ==

Nationalization can have positive and negative effects. In 2019 research based on studies from Greenwich University found that the nationalization of key services such as water, bus, railways and broadband in the United Kingdom could save £13bn every year.

Nationalization may produce other effects, such as reducing competition in the marketplace, which in turn reduces incentives to innovation and maintains high prices. In the short run, nationalization can provide a larger revenue stream for government but may cause that industry to falter depending on the motivations of the nationalizing party. 

Nationalization was employed by the Panamanian Government towards the Panama Canal, which came under the Panama Canal Authority in 1999 to internationally positive effect. Likewise, the Suez Canal was nationalized multiple times throughout history. In Germany, the Federal Press [&quot;Bundesdruckerei&quot;] was nationalized in 2008 with positive revenue and net income since.

== Expropriation ==

&quot;Expropriation&quot; is the seizure of private property by a public agency for a purpose deemed to be in the public interest. It may also be used as a penalty for criminal proceedings. Expropriation differs from eminent domain in that the property owner is not compensated for the seized property. Unlike eminent domain, expropriation may also refer to the taking of private property by a &quot;private&quot; entity authorized by a government to take property in certain situations. 

Due to political risks that are involved when countries engage in international business, it is important to understand the expropriation risks and laws within each of the countries in which business is conducted in order to understand the risks as an investor in that country.

== Trends ==
Studies have found that nationalization follows a cyclical trend. Nationalization rose in the 1960s and 1970s, followed by an increase in privatization in the 80s and 90s, followed again by an increase in nationalization in the 2000s and 2010s.

==Marxist theory==
The term appears as &quot;expropriation of expropriators (ruling classes)&quot; in Marxist theory, and also as the slogan &quot;Loot the looters!&quot; (&quot;грабь награбленное&quot;), which was very popular during the Russian October Revolution. The term is also used to describe nationalization campaigns by communist states, such as dekulakization and collectivization in the USSR.

However, nationalization is not a specifically socialist strategy, and Marxism&#x27;s founders were skeptical of its value. As Engels put it:
Nikolai Bukharin also criticised the term &quot;nationalisation&quot;, preferring the term &quot;statisation&quot; instead.

<doc id="1062460" wikidata="Q3014558" url="?curid=1062460" title="Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake">
<text>Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake is a large military installation in California that supports the research, testing and evaluation programs of the United States Navy. It is part of Navy Region Southwest under Commander, Navy Installations Command, and was originally known as Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS).

The installation is located in the Western Mojave Desert region of California, approximately north of Los Angeles. Occupying land in three counties – Kern, San Bernardino, and Inyo – the installation&#x27;s closest neighbors are the city of Ridgecrest and the communities of Inyokern, Trona, and Darwin.

China Lake is the United States Navy&#x27;s largest single landholding, representing 85% of the Navy&#x27;s land for weapons and armaments research, development, acquisition, testing, and evaluation (RDAT&amp;E) use and 38% of the Navy&#x27;s land holdings worldwide. In total, its two ranges and main site cover more than , an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. As of 2010, at least 95% of that land is undeveloped. The roughly $3 billion infrastructure of the installation consists of 2,132 buildings and facilities, of paved roads, and of unpaved roads.

The of restricted and controlled airspace at China Lake makes up 12% of California&#x27;s total airspace. Jointly controlled by NAWS China Lake, Edwards Air Force Base and Fort Irwin, this airspace is known as the R-2508 Special Use Airspace Complex.

A 7.1 magnitude earthquake on July 5, 2019, whose epicenter was within the boundaries of NAWS China Lake, resulted in the facility being temporarily evaluated as &quot;not mission capable&quot; due to damage.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The installation is located in the Western Mojave Desert region of California, approximately north of Los Angeles. Occupying land in three counties – Kern, San Bernardino, and Inyo – the installation&#x27;s closest neighbors are the city of Ridgecrest and the communities of Inyokern, Trona, and Darwin.

==== Armitage Field ====

All aircraft operations at NAWS China Lake are conducted at Armitage Field, which has three runways with more than of taxiway. More than 20,000 crewed and uncrewed military sorties are conducted out of Armitage by U.S. Armed Forces each year.

Foreign military personnel also use the airfield and range to conduct more than 1,000 test and evaluation operations each year.

=== Wildlife ===
The majority of the land at NAWS China Lake is undeveloped. It provides habitat for more than 340 species of wildlife, including feral horses, feral burros (donkeys), bighorn sheep and endangered animals, such as the desert tortoise, Mojave ground squirrel and Mojave tui chub. The Mojave tui chub was introduced to China Lake&#x27;s Lark Seep in 1971. Lark Seep is fed by the water outflow from a wastewater treatment plant located at China Lake. The tui chub population has since grown and expanded to a population of around 6,000 in 2003. The desert on which the installation is built is home to 650 plant types.

=== Petroglyphs ===
The area was once home to the Native American Coso People, whose presence is marked by thousands of archaeological sites; the Coso traded with other tribes as far away as San Luis Obispo County, California. This locale was also used by European miners and settlers whose cabins and mining structures are extant throughout the Station.

The Coso Range Canyons are home to the Coso Rock Art District, an area of some which contains more than 50,000 documented petroglyphs, the highest concentration of rock art in the Northern Hemisphere.

The precise age of the petroglyphs is unknown. A broad range of dates can be inferred from archaeological sites in the area and some artifact forms depicted on the rocks. Archaeologists disagree on their age, but it is generally believed that most petroglyphs are between one and three thousand years old. Designs range from animals to abstract to anthropomorphic figures. Opinions vary widely on whether the petroglyphs were made for ceremonial purposes, whether they tell stories to pass along the mythology of their makers, or whether they are records of hunting hopes or successes, clan symbols, or maps.

Declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, the rock art in Little Petroglyph Canyon provides insights into the cultural heritage and knowledge of the desert&#x27;s past. Everything in the canyon area is protected, including the obsidian chips and any artifacts or tools, as well as the petroglyphs and native vegetation and wildlife.

Little Petroglyph Canyon contains 20,000 documented images. It is open to the public for tours.

=== Monorail ===
Remains of the Epsom Salts Monorail are signposted and visible within the site. The central rail, on which mining tractors pulled minerals from a mine to the nearest railway siding, was supported on wooden A-frames of a low trestle.

=== Coso Geothermal Field ===
The Coso Geothermal Field is within China Lake boundaries. The geothermal power plants located there began generating electricity in 1987 and were the Navy&#x27;s first foray into producing clean power from the earth&#x27;s thermal energy (heat). The plant&#x27;s nameplate capacity is 270 megawatts, with a total annual electricity production from the field of 1,175 gigawatt-hours.

== Tenant commands ==

The 620 active duty military, 4,166 civilian employees and 1,734 contractors that make up China Lake&#x27;s workforce are employed across multiple tenant commands, including:

* Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division
* Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 9 (VX-9)
* Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 31 (VX-31)
* Marine Aviation Detachment
* Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 3 Detachment
* Explosive Ordnance Disposal Testing and Evaluation Unit 1
* Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Detachment
* Naval Construction Training Center Port Hueneme (Seabees)

== History ==
China Lake is a dry lake. Its name comes from Chinese prospectors harvesting borax from the lake bed, approximately south of Paxton Ranch. The operation was known locally as &quot;The Little Chinese Borax Works&quot;.

===Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS)===
Amid World War II, adequate facilities were needed by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) for test and evaluation of rockets. At the same time, the Navy needed a new proving ground for aviation ordnance. Caltech&#x27;s Charles C. Lauritsen and then U.S. Navy Commander Sherman E. Burroughs worked together to find a site that would meet both their needs.

In the early 1930s, an emergency landing field had been built by the Works Progress Administration in the Mojave Desert near the small town of Inyokern, California. Opened in 1935, the field was acquired by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in 1942. In November 1943, it was transferred to the Navy, which established China Lake as the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS).

The NOTS mission was defined in a letter by the Secretary of the Navy as &quot;... a station having for its primary function the research, development, and testing of weapons, and having an additional function of furnishing primary training in the use of such weapons.&quot; Testing began within a month of the Station&#x27;s formal establishment. The vast and sparsely populated desert, with near-perfect flying weather and practically unlimited visibility, proved an ideal location for test and evaluation activities and a complete research and development establishment.

During 1944, NOTS worked on the development and testing of the 3.5-inch, 5-inch, HVAR and 11.75-inch (Tiny Tim) rockets.

Manhattan Project funding was used to construct a new airfield at NOTS, with three runways, , and long, each wide to accommodate the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber. Fuel storage was provided with a capacity of of gasoline and of oil. The airfield was opened on June 1, 1945, and named Armitage Field after Navy Lieutenant John Armitage, who was killed while testing a Tiny Tim rocket at NOTS in August 1944. Work done by Caltech at NOTS for the Manhattan Project - particularly the testing of bomb shapes dropped from B-29s - was included as part of codename Project Camel.

In 1950, NOTS scientists and engineers developed the air-intercept missile (AIM) 9 Sidewinder, which became the world&#x27;s most used and most copied air-to-air missile. Other rockets and missiles developed or tested at China Lake include the Mighty Mouse, Zuni, Shrike, HARM, Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW) and Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).

The two Randsburg Wash Target Test Towers (Buildings 70021 and 70022) situated at are significant for their role in the naval testing of proximity or variable time (VT) fuzes, a vital element of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s weapons program. The towers played a key role in the Cold War proximity fuze test program at the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Randsburg Wash facility, a program that eventually led to the Navy adapting the use of these fuzes to guided missiles. The towers are important on a national level during the period of significance between 1952 and 1960; the years in which the most important achievements in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s developments of the properties and attributes of proximity fuzes. The towers are also significant for their unique engineering achievement, as 360 foot-tall, pyramidal wood towers. Targets are suspended between the two towers.

In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy visited NAWS China Lake for an air show and to see the Michelson Lab.

===Naval Weapons Center===

In July 1967, NOTS China Lake and the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Corona, California, became the Naval Weapons Center. The Corona facilities were closed, and their functions transferred to the desert in 1971. In July 1979, the mission and functions of the National Parachute Test Range at Naval Air Facility El Centro were transferred to China Lake.

===Naval Air Weapons Station===
In January 1992, the Naval Weapons Center and the Pacific Missile Test Center Point Mugu were disestablished and joined with naval units at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque and at the White Sands Missile Range at White Sands, NM as a single command - the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). At the same time, the physical plant at China Lake was designated as a Naval Air Weapons Station and became the host of the NAVAIR Weapons Division, performing the base-keeping functions.

In 1982, the community area of China Lake, including most of the base housing, was annexed by the City of Ridgecrest. In 2013, Congress reserved China Lake&#x27;s acreage for an additional 25 years for military use.

In 2014, U.S. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California introduced a bill to permanently designate Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake property for military use, arguing it would save taxpayer money and enhance the base&#x27;s mission. The bill would add , including about that were part of a bombing range in San Bernardino County, as well as along the station&#x27;s southwest boundary. The Bureau of Land Management said that DoD needs could change in future decades and that it is a popular recreation area with trail riding, campsites, and hunting, and an important wildlife corridor, especially for the threatened desert tortoise.

In July 2019, two large earthquakes struck Southern California; both had epicenters within the NAWS boundaries. The first, on July 4, a 6.4 magnitude quake, caused no injuries at NAWS, and the initial reports showed that all buildings were intact. The second, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake on July 5, resulted in the facility being evaluated as &quot;not mission capable&quot;. The report shows that officials assessed all buildings, utilities, and facilities — 3,598 structures in all — for 13 days after the earthquakes and found damage totaled $5.2 billion. Replacing buildings alone would cost $2.2 billion, but officials also must replace or repair specialized equipment, furniture, machine tools, telecommunication assets and other facilities.

<doc id="1062464" wikidata="Q2341030" url="?curid=1062464" title="Ickleford">
<text>Ickleford is a large village situated on the northern outskirts of Hitchin in North Hertfordshire in England. It lies on the west bank of the River Hiz and to the east of the main A600 road. The population at the time of the 2011 census was 1,833.

==Etymology==
Its name is derived from it being a ford, that is a way to cross a river, along the Icknield Way. Another village, Ickford, shares the same etymology.

==Governance==
The modern parish of Ickleford includes areas that were historically detached parts of Shillington and Holwell, both of which were in Bedfordshire. The Shillington exclave was transferred to Hertfordshire by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. The Holwell exclave was transferred to Hertfordshire in 1897.

Ickleford Parish Council was established under the Local Government Act 1894.

==Notable buildings==
St Katharine&#x27;s church, set amid cedar trees, has a 12th-century Norman nave and blocked north doorway with beautifully carved zigzag arches, and a south aisle and chapel added by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in 1859. The east window has some fine stained glass of 1860. It is the burial-place of Henry Boswell, &quot;King of the Gypsies&quot;, who died in 1760, at the advanced age of 90; the remains of his wife and granddaughter are likewise interred here.

==Transport==
The Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village. The Bedford to Hitchin Line used to pass through the village, remnants of which can still be seen in places such as Gerry&#x27;s Hole where parts of the old bridge and embankment are still present. The local Parish Council attempted to raise public awareness of the village through its Parish Plan in 2006–07.

==Facilities==
Ickleford has a primary school (Ickleford Primary School), village hall, general store and a unisex hairdresser

There are two public houses: The Old George and The Plume of Feathers.

The large Sports and Recreation ground also contains a playground and a licensed bar. The Sports and Recreation Ground caters for several sports, including cricket, football, squash and pétanque, and is home to the Ickleford Cricket Club, whose symbol represents two crossed farmers pitchforks. The club was founded in 1947 and in 2006 won promotion to Division 3 of the Saracens Herts League, and was promoted to Division 2 in 2010. Since 2006, the cricket club&#x27;s first team has used the nickname &quot;The Tigers&quot;. Outside the Recreation Ground towards the school there is a newly built cemetery.

Ickleford also has a Scout troop (the 1st Ickleford (9th Hitchin)) with active sections of Beavers, Cubs and Scouts for both boys and girls.

== Early life and education ==
Kramer was born in 1932 in New York City. He graduated with a BSc From The Institute of Design, Chicago in Visual Communication and an MFA in Graphic Design from Yale University. 

==Career==
Kramer began working in the late 1950s for Will Burtin, then as Assistant Art Director of &quot;The Architectural Record&quot;, for Geigy Chemical and Pharmaceuticals In Ardsley, New York, and then as Art Director at the Erwin Halpern advertising agency in Zurich, Switzerland.

In 1966-67, he was Director of Corporate Design for Clairtone, redesigning their logo and many other aspects of their graphic identity. 

In late 1967 he founded Kramer Design Associates Limited, a multi-media firm specializing in corporate I.D. Programs, signage systems and print. Kramer was a professor at the Ontario College of Art and Design (part-time faculty) for 21 years, lectured at universities in Mexico, Canada, the US and Switzerland. He has been a member of AGI. Alliance Graphique Internationale and an Academician of the Royal Canadian Academy of Art since 1974. He is listed in Who&#x27;s Who in American Art, Canadian Who&#x27;s Who, Who&#x27;s who in The World, and many others. Kramer is currently active as an artist, showing his geometric abstractions at galleries in Canada and abroad.

== Honours ==
Kramer was awarded GDC Fellowship in 1975. He was made a member of the Order of Ontario in 2002, the first graphic designer to be inducted into the order. He received an honorary Doctorate (D.Des.) from the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design in 2003. In 2015 he was awarded the Art Directors and Designers of Canada Usherwood Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Khlebnikov was an Imperial Russian jewelry firm, founded ca. 1867 by Ivan Khlebnikov in Saint Petersburg, but transferred to Moscow in 1871. 

The business was highly successful and received the Imperial Warrant, producing work of originality and highest quality using decoration in the traditional Russian style on many pieces. Enamel was a speciality, especially plique-à-jour, but also cloisonné. Demand for its work was high and in 1882 it employed 200 craftsmen. The business succumbed at the time of the Russian Revolution.

<text>The Nudelman-Richter NR-23 is a Soviet autocannon widely used in military aircraft of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. It was designed by A. E. Nudelman and A. A. Richter to replace the wartime Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 and Volkov-Yartsev VYa-23, entering service in 1949.

The NR-23 is a single-barrel, short recoil-operated 23 mm (0.90 in) cannon. It was similar to the NS-23 but mechanical improvements increased its rate of fire by more than 50%. Its theoretical rate of fire was 850 rounds per minute, although United States Air Force tests of captured weapons achieved an actual rate of fire of only 650 rounds per minute.

The NR-23 was later replaced by the Afanasev Makarov AM-23 automatic cannon which had a higher firing rate. The AM-23 was used in turreted installations for bombers. It was a gas-operated weapon, weighed 43 kg (95 lb) and was capable of a substantially higher rate of fire (1,200–1,300 rounds per minute).

The People&#x27;s Republic of China manufactures copies of both versions of this weapon as [[Norinco]] Type 23-1 (NR-23) and Type 23-2 (AM-23), respectively.

== Applications ==
The NR-23 was used on fighter aircraft, including the MiG-15, Lavochkin La-15, MiG-17, and some models of the MiG-19. In addition, it was also used on the Ilyushin Il-28 and Beriev Be-6. The AM-23 was used in the defensive turrets of the Antonov An-12B, Myasishchev M-4, Tupolev Tu-14, Tupolev Tu-16, Tupolev Tu-95/Tu-142, and the Tupolev Tu-98 prototype.

The NR-23 is also the only cannon to have been fired in space. Published accounts state that a Nudelman-Richter gun was installed on Almaz 2 space station. On the final day of the Almaz 2&#x27;s deployment, the cannons were tested by firing a total of 20 rounds. The details of this test and its results remain classified.

In the mid-1960s the cannon was replaced in Soviet service by the twin-barrel Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L.

The mechanism of the NR-23 was scaled up to produce the more powerful NR-30 30 mm gun used in the MiG-19 and some marks of the MiG-21.

<text>Bonifacio Ondó Edú-Aguong (16 March 1922 – 5 March 1969) was an Equatoguinean politician who served as the Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea from 1964 to 1968 while it was still under Spanish colonial rule, as Spanish Guinea. He played a leading role in the country&#x27;s independence, and led the from 1959 until his death.

He took office when the country gained autonomy in 1964, and ran in the country&#x27;s first presidential election in 1968, losing in the run-off. He handed power over to newly elected president Francisco Macías Nguema on 12 October 1968 (the day of independence). He was imprisoned and officially committed suicide only a few months later. Another account says he returned in 1969 from exile in Gabon and was killed.

==Biography==
===Early and personal life===

Bonifacio Ondó Edú-Aguong, a member of the Fang people, was born in 1922, in Evinayong, Spanish Guinea. Ondó Edú married Edelvina Oyana, also a member of the Fang people, and the two were the parents of a large family. Ondó Edú has been described as &quot;of profound religious-Catholic convictions.&quot;

During the 1950s, emerging groups of African nationalists began pushing for independence from Spain. However, after the murder of several independence leaders such as Acacio Mañé Ela and and the arrests of 24 others in 1959, many nationalists chose to flee into exile and continue the movement abroad, including Ondó Edú. He founded the party (&quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Movement of Equatorial Guinea&quot;) in Libreville, Gabon, in October 1959.

On 15 December 1963, Spain held an autonomy referendum, with 62.5% of eligible Equatoguinean voters voting yes for autonomy. That same year, Spain began allowing open political activity in Equatorial Guinea, which led to several Equatoguinean political parties being formed. Ondó Edú&#x27;s UPLGE became the moderate (&quot;National Unity Movement of Equatorial Guinea&quot;), in November of that year.

===Prime minister of Spanish Guinea===
When Spanish Guinea was granted autonomy in 1964, a provisional council was created to govern the country. Ondó Edú became the Prime Minister (or President) of the council on 1 January 1964. His Deputy (or Vice President) was Francisco Macías Nguema of the political party Idea Popular de Guinea Ecuatorial (IPGE). The council included politicians from Spanish Guinea&#x27;s various ethnic groups, including Fang, Bubi, and Ndowe people.

In foreign policy, Ondó Edú established good relations with Gabon and its president Léon M&#x27;ba (also a Fang). He visited Libreville in May 1965, and was given a warm reception, being referred to as the &quot;President of Equatorial Guinea&quot; by the local press.
Ondó Edú was his party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 1968 general election. He campaigned as a moderate who supported continued ties with Spain after independence, while his main opponent, Macías Nguema, was vocally critical of further Spanish involvement in Equatoguinean affairs post-independence. Ondó Edú had the support of then-Deputy Prime Minister of Spain Luis Carrero Blanco, the wider Spanish government, businessmen, the middle class, and various local ethnic groups. His official symbol was a gazelle. In the first round, he received 31,941 votes (34.84%). In the second round, he received 40,254 votes (37.08%). In both rounds, he came in second to Macías Nguema, who won 36,716 votes (40.05%) in the first round and 68,310 votes (62.92%) in the second round. Macías Nguema ultimately won the elections.

On 11 October 1968, Ondó Edú was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella The Catholic by Minister of Information and Tourism Manuel Fraga on behalf of the Spanish government. 

On 12 October 1968, Ondó Edu transferred power to president-elect Macías Nguema. Fraga signed Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s Declaration of Independence later that day, officially making the country independent from Spanish rule. Equatorial Guinea became the 44th independent African nation.

===Exile and death===
After the end of his term, Ondó Edú, fearing for his life, once again fled into exile in Gabon. Macías Nguema, who quickly began establishing a dictatorship, requested that Gabonese President Omar Bongo extradite Ondó Edú back to Equatorial Guinea, but Bongo refused. However, the Spanish government complied, and forcibly returned Ondó Edú to the country. He was arrested upon his return, and according to the Equatoguinean government&#x27;s official account, he committed suicide on March 5, 1969. However, according to one account, Ondó Edú was tortured in Black Beach prison for ten days by Mariano Mdemendongo, a member of the national guard, before finally being executed. His wife was also reportedly killed on Macías Nguema&#x27;s orders the same year he was.

<text>Mark Philipp Wirtz (3 September 19437 August 2020) was a German-French pop music record producer, composer, singer, musician, author, and comedian. Wirtz is best known for &quot;A Teenage Opera&quot; concept album, a project he devised while working under contract to EMI at Abbey Road Studios with Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick. The first single from the planned album, &quot;Excerpt from A Teenage Opera&quot; by Keith West, was a number 2 hit on the UK Singles Chart in September 1967 and encapsulates Wirtz&#x27;s signature style, described by &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine as &quot;Phil Spector scoring Camberwick Green&quot;. Another track produced and arranged by Wirtz, the 1966 single &quot;A Touch of Velvet – A Sting of Brass&quot; credited to The Mood-Mosaic featuring the Ladybirds, became well-known in Germany as the theme tune for the Radio Bremen television show &quot;Musikladen&quot;, and was used by some radio stations and DJs in the United Kingdom as an ident, notably Dave Lee Travis on Radio Caroline.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Wirtz was born in Strasbourg, and raised in Cologne, Germany. He moved to England in 1962.

=== Early career (1960s) ===
Mark Wirtz began his music career while studying art at London&#x27;s Fairfield College of Arts and Sciences. According to a former flatmate, &quot;Three things already stood out in him at the age of seventeen: his prodigious talent as an artist – he could paint original work in the style of any of the grand masters; his natural ability as a musician – he could pick out any tune on the piano by ear; and his zany sense of humour – he idolized the comedian Jerry Lewis.&quot;

He was studying drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art when his college rock band, The Beatcrackers, were signed to a recording contract in 1963 as Mark Rogers and the Marksmen by EMI producer Norman Newell. They recorded a single, &quot;Bubble Pop&quot;. By 1965 Wirtz had started his first independent production company, and worked with Marlene Dietrich as well as releasing his own instrumentals under various pseudonyms. In 1966, he wrote and produced the single &quot;A Touch of Velvet – A Sting of Brass&quot;, an orchestral production credited to The Mood-Mosaic with vocals by the Ladybirds, which became a popular theme tune on pirate radio stations.

In 1967, Wirtz accepted EMI veteran producer/A&amp;R chief Norrie Paramor&#x27;s offer to join EMI Records as in-house producer. Working at Abbey Road Studios alongside the Beatles and Pink Floyd, often with engineer Geoff Emerick, Wirtz wrote and produced landmark recordings by artists such as Keith West, Tomorrow, and Kippington Lodge. He reached global success with his production of &quot;Excerpt from A Teenage Opera&quot; (also known as &quot;Grocer Jack&quot;), recorded by Keith West. Though never completed or released as an entire work, the idea of a rock opera became influential.

Wirtz was married to singer Ross Hannaman for a period of time. Together, they wrote and recorded the song &quot;Barefoot and Tiptoe&quot; under the name The Sweetshop, erroneously believed to have been from &quot;A Teenage Opera&quot;. Wirtz and Hannaman divorced in 1969, at which time Wirtz teamed up with poetry writer Maria Feltham to record Wirtz&#x27;s concept album, &quot;Philwit and Pegasus&quot;, for composer Les Reed&#x27;s Chapter One label.

In 1969, his creative freedom restricted by drastic changes in A&amp;R policy, Wirtz resigned his post at EMI Records to return to independent production. Associations with Larry Page&#x27;s Penny Farthing label, Samantha Jones, and Kris Ife followed, during which Wirtz formed a co-writing partnership (&quot;Learning 2 Live With Love&quot;, MWET/Spyderbaby (2005); &quot;One Night Stand&quot;, MWET/Anthony Rivers (2005), and the &quot;Cooking For Cannibals&quot; soundtrack album (2007).

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Wirtz moved to Los Angeles to accept an invitation by his fellow expatriate producer and friend Denny Cordell to work with him at Hollywood&#x27;s Shelter Records. In 1973, Wirtz signed a writer/artist/producer contract with Capitol Records for whom he recorded two albums, &quot;Balloon&quot; and &quot;Hothouse Smiles&quot;. Both were released under the name &quot;Marc Wirtz&quot;.

In 1975, dropped by Capitol for his refusal to tour or perform publicly, he signed with producer Tom Catalano and veteran publisher Dan Crewe&#x27;s RCA-distributed TomCat label, a short-lived association because of the label folding only weeks after Wirtz&#x27;s first single release, &quot;We Could Have Laughed Forever&quot;. Having become a parent in the same year, Wirtz dropped his &quot;loose cannon&quot; career pursuits and, under the name of Marc Peters, became a freelance session arranger/conductor in partnership with several producers, including Kim Fowley and Jimmy Bowen. He subsequently created numerous pop, R&amp;B and country songs that featured an array of artists as diverse as Helen Reddy, Leon Russell, Vicky Leandros, Kim Carnes, Dean Martin, and Anthony Newley.

In 1979, signed by Russ Regan to Interworld Music/CBS Records as writer and producer, Wirtz produced his third solo album, &quot;Lost Pets&quot;, sequentially joined by guitarists Richard Bennett and John Beland, keyboard players Alan Lindgren and Tom Hensley, drummers Billy Thomas and Denny Seiwell, and bassists David Hungate and Les Hurdle. However, the production was never finished due to Wirtz&#x27;s decision to concentrate on his family, leading to a 20-year hiatus from the music business.

=== Hiatus from music ===
During those years, after savings had run out and royalties had dwindled, Wirtz took on a gamut of jobs, including telemarketer, waiter, maître d&#x27;, bloodstock agent, interpreter, voice-over artist, seminar leader and eventually sales manager for a Geneva merger and acquisition firm.

While taking acting classes during off-times and in the pursuit of a new career as a novelist, Wirtz also realized a lifelong ambition to be a comedian by studying and performing at Hollywood&#x27;s Groundlings Improv Theater, to eventually take his first steps onto the stages of Hollywood&#x27;s comedy clubs, including The Comedy Store and The Improv.

In 1996, Wirtz moved to Savannah, Georgia, where he became an award-winning freelance magazine columnist/critic, writing about food and drama, while publishing his first novels, &quot;Sisyphus Rocks&quot; and &quot;Love Is Eggshaped&quot;, as well as selling paintings in a Savannah gallery.

=== Later years and death ===
In 2004, giving in to the plea from his daughter Nicole (by now resident in Spain) to produce her rock-band-leader boyfriend&#x27;s debut album, Wirtz flew to Barcelona and returned to the studio for the first time in many years to produce Les Philippes&#x27; &quot;Philharmonic Philanthropy&quot;. Before year&#x27;s end, the band&#x27;s album was No. 1 in the independent label charts. Wirtz continued his rebounded studio activities by subsequently producing his own Mark Wirtz Eartheatre solo album &quot;Love Is Eggshaped&quot;, Spyderbaby UK&#x27;s &quot;Glassblower&quot; CD, and Anthony Rivers&#x27; &quot;Marked Confidential&quot;.

In January 2006, Wirtz found a path back into comedy by collaborating with Jacksonville, Florida&#x27;s &quot;Jax Comics&quot; group of working comedians, initially working out at the Comedy Zone, then moving on by touring the southeast&#x27;s comedy clubs in the development of his stand-up comedy act. In 2010, Wirtz produced an all-new solo studio album, &quot;Lost Pets 2&quot;, scheduled for international release by PoppyDisc Records in October 2010.

Wirtz died on the morning of 7 August 2020 from Pick&#x27;s disease.

<text>The Nudelman-Rikhter NR-30 was a Soviet autocannon widely used in military aircraft of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. It was designed by A.E. Nudelman and A. A. Rikhter, entering service in 1954.

==Description==
Prior to the introduction of the NR-30, most Soviet autocannon were of 23 or 37 mm calibre and often used in combination. For instance, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 was equipped with two NR-23&#x27;s and a single N-37. The two were mismatched; the NR-23 was a rapid-fire weapon with relatively low explosive power, while the N-37 was extremely powerful, typically able to destroy a bomber with a single hit, but with very a low firing rate which made it unsuited to firing at manoeuvring targets like fighters. Moreover, the two had very different ballistics which meant that long-range fire would result in only one or the other set of guns being properly aimed.

The NR-30 was an attempt to solve this problem by introducing a single weapon that could serve in both roles. It was essentially an enlarged version of the NR-23 using the same short recoil mechanism firing a new 400 gram 30 mm round that was roughly twice the mass of the earlier NR-23 and slightly less than half that of the N-37. While not capable of destroying a bomber in a single hit, it made up for this by improving the firing rate to 900 cycles per minute, beyond that of the NR-23. Muzzle velocity increased to 800 m/s, besting both the NR-23 and N-37.

Its total firepower, the product of per-round energy and firing rate, was better than either of the earlier weapons. This demanded the use of a muzzle brake with an integrated flame damper to prevent airframe damage from its firing. In fighters, wing mountings were more common than the nose mounts of the earlier designs. This often required small sections of stainless steel to be fitted to the wing skinning to protect it. 

Aircraft typically carried a load of 70 shells for each gun. There were 20 different types of ammunition available; the most used were AP and HEI, the latter of 40–48 g HE internal charge, several times larger than 20 mm ammunition. An unusual munition was the Chaff dispenser PRL, with 48,000 chaff particles internally; it is not known how it was used. 

The NR-30 was also remarkably light, about one-third lighter than the N-37 while offering higher firepower. The GSh-301 is the only lighter 30 mm gun.


The NR-30 was used mainly in the MiG-19, early MiG-21 models, the Sukhoi Su-7, and the Sukhoi Su-17. It was also used on the Shenyang J-6, the Chinese copy of the MiG-19, with a third gun in the nose. The Chinese manufactured their own version, the Type-30, basically similar though with slightly different characteristics.

==Ammunition specifications==
* Caliber: 30x155mm (belted) with a brass case
* Projectile weight: 410 grams (14½ oz), 840 g (1 lb 13½ oz) complete
* Launch charge: 95 g to 99 g of 6/7fl VBP smokeless powder

<doc id="1062541" wikidata="Q3505167" url="?curid=1062541" title="Multiple encryption">
<text>Multiple encryption is the process of encrypting an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or a different algorithm. It is also known as cascade encryption, cascade ciphering, multiple encryption, and superencipherment. Superencryption refers to the outer-level encryption of a multiple encryption.

Some cryptographers, like Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins University, say multiple encryption addresses a problem that mostly doesn&#x27;t exist:
However, from the previous quote an argument for multiple encryption can be made, namely poor implementation. Using two different cryptomodules and keying processes from two different vendors requires both vendors&#x27; wares to be compromised for security to fail completely.

==Independent keys==
Picking any two ciphers, if the key used is the same for both, the second cipher could possibly undo the first cipher, partly or entirely. This is true of ciphers where the decryption process is exactly the same as the encryption process (a reciprocal cipher) – the second cipher would completely undo the first. If an attacker were to recover the key through cryptanalysis of the first encryption layer, the attacker could possibly decrypt all the remaining layers, assuming the same key is used for all layers.

To prevent that risk, one can use keys that are statistically independent for each layer (e.g. independent RNGs).

Ideally each key should have separate and different generation, sharing, and management processes.

==Independent Initialization Vectors==
For en/decryption processes that require sharing an Initialization Vector (IV) / nonce these are typically, openly shared or made known to the recipient (and everyone else). Its good security policy never to provide the same data in both plaintext and ciphertext when using the same key and IV. Therefore, its recommended &quot;(although at this moment without specific evidence)&quot; to use separate IVs for each layer of encryption.

==Importance of the first layer==
With the exception of the one-time pad, no cipher has been theoretically proven to be unbreakable. Furthermore, some recurring properties may be found in the ciphertexts generated by the first cipher. Since those ciphertexts are the plaintexts used by the second cipher, the second cipher may be rendered vulnerable to attacks based on known plaintext properties (see references below).

This is the case when the first layer is a program P that always adds the same string S of characters at the beginning (or end) of all ciphertexts (commonly known as a magic number). When found in a file, the string S allows an operating system to know that the program P has to be launched in order to decrypt the file. This string should be removed before adding a second layer.

To prevent this kind of attack, one can use the method provided by Bruce Schneier:

* Generate a random pad R of the same size as the plaintext.
* Encrypt R using the first cipher and key.
* XOR the plaintext with the pad, then encrypt the result using the second cipher and a different (!) key.
* Concatenate both ciphertexts in order to build the final ciphertext.

A cryptanalyst must break both ciphers to get any information. This will, however, have the drawback of making the ciphertext twice as long as the original plaintext.

Note, however, that a weak first cipher may merely make a second cipher that is vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack also vulnerable to a known plaintext attack. However, a block cipher must not be vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack to be considered secure. Therefore, the second cipher described above is not secure under that definition, either. Consequently, both ciphers still need to be broken. The attack illustrates why strong assumptions are made about secure block ciphers and ciphers that are even partially broken should never be used.

==The Rule of Two==
The Rule of Two is a data security principle from the NSA&#x27;s Commercial Solutions for Classified Program (CSfC). It specifies two completely independent layers of cryptography to protect data. For example, data could be protected by both hardware encryption at its lowest level and software encryption at the application layer. It could mean using two FIPS-validated software cryptomodules from different vendors to en/decrypt data.

The importance of vendor and/or model diversity between the layers of components centers around removing the possibility that the manufacturers or models will share a vulnerability. This way if one components is compromised there is still an entire layer of encryption protecting the information at rest or in transit. The CSfC Program offers solutions to achieve diversity in two ways. &quot;The first is to implement each layer using components produced by different manufacturers. The second is to use components from the same manufacturer, where that
manufacturer has provided NSA with sufficient evidence that the implementations of the two components are independent of one another.&quot;

The principle is practiced in the NSA&#x27;s secure mobile phone called Fishbowl. The phones use two layers of encryption protocols, IPsec and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), to protect voice communications. The Samsung Galaxy S9 Tactical Edition is also an approved CSfC Component.

==Examples==
The figure shows from inside to outside the process of how the encrypted capsule is formed in the context of Echo Protocol, used by the Software Application GoldBug Messenger. GoldBug has implemented a hybrid system for authenticity and confidentiality.

First layer of the encryption: 
The ciphertext of the original readable message is hashed, and subsequently the symmetric keys are encrypted via the asymmetric key – e.g. deploying the algorithm RSA.
In an intermediate step the ciphertext, and the hash digest of the ciphertext are combined into a capsule, and packed together.
It follows the approach: . In order for the receiver to verify that the ciphertext has not been tampered with, the digest is computed before the ciphertext is decrypted.

Second layer of encryption:
Optionally it is still possible, therefore to encrypt the capsule of the first layer in addition with an , – comparable to a commonly shared, 32-character long symmetric password. Hybrid Encryption is then added to multiple encryption.

Third layer of the encryption:
Then, this capsule is transmitted via a secure connection to the communication partner.

<text>Friction, Baby is the third studio album by Better Than Ezra, released in 1996.

The album&#x27;s title comes from a television interview with Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. When asked how he and Mick Jagger stayed together for so long, Richards took a long drag from his cigarette and said &quot;friction, baby.&quot; This may also be a reference to the fact that the band had replaced its original drummer, Cary Bonnecaze, between the recording of their previous album and this one.

The album produced two hits on the Billboard modern rock charts: &quot;King of New Orleans&quot; and &quot;Desperately Wanting.&quot; &quot;Desperately Wanting&quot; also narrowly missed the Billboard Top 40, peaking at #48. The third and fourth singles, &quot;Long Lost&quot; and &quot;Normal Town,&quot; failed to chart.

==Critical reception==
In its review, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called &quot;Friction, Baby&quot; &quot;a batch of low-impact pop cheese that&#x27;s too mindlessly catchy not to be likable.&quot;

==Track listing==
# &quot;King of New Orleans&quot; – 4:07
# &quot;Rewind&quot; – 3:07
# &quot;Long Lost&quot; – 3:40
# &quot;Normal Town&quot; – 3:39

# &quot;Return of the Post Moderns&quot; – 2:54

<doc id="1062548" wikidata="Q4354137" url="?curid=1062548" title="King World">
<text>King World Productions, Inc. (also known as King World Entertainment, King World Enterprises, or simply King World) was a production company and syndicator of television programming in the United States founded by Charles King (1912–72) that was active from 1964 to 2007.

Following his death, it was run by his son Roger until it was acquired by CBS in 1999 and merged with CBS Paramount Domestic Television to form CBS Television Distribution (now CBS Media Ventures). Following Roger King&#x27;s death, the company and its subsidiary KWP Studios Inc. continue to exist on paper as intellectual property holders who maintain the copyrights for programs like &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, &quot;Rachael Ray&quot;, and the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; format.

==History==
===Founding with &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;===
The division was started in 1964 by Charles King (1912–1972). It was a company that expressly handled television distribution of the Hal Roach-produced &quot;Our Gang&quot; short comedy films from the 1930s. When Roach lost the rights to the name &quot;Our Gang&quot; (it was retained by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio, who bought the series from Roach in 1938), the shorts were retitled as &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;.

It was through this acquisition that the comedy shorts made from 1929 through 1938 have been made available to audiences for the past fifty years. King World later co-produced an animated TV special with Muller-Rosen Productions and Murakami-Wolf-Swenson in 1979 called &quot;The Little Rascals Christmas Special&quot; and later co-produced a 1982–1984 animated &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; TV series with Hanna-Barbera. King died in 1972 and the company was taken over by King&#x27;s children: Roger M. King (1944–2007), Michael (1948–2015), Robert (1940–2020), Diana (1949–2019), Richard (1941–2020), and Karen.

===1980s expansion===
In 1983, the company acquired the syndication rights to NBC&#x27;s daytime game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Merv Griffin, the show&#x27;s creator and producer, had shopped the program to various other studios prior to reaching a deal with King World. King World also would acquire the rights to distribute Griffin&#x27;s own long-running talk/variety program from Metromedia&#x27;s syndication division. A year later, Griffin announced plans to revive another of his game show creations, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, and King World agreed to distribute that program as well.

In 1984 King World formed an ad-sales barter division called Camelot Entertainment Sales. Later that year president Robert King left the company to form The Television Program Source; a television syndication company that was founded as a joint venture between King, Alan Bennett, and Columbia Pictures Television. King World also purchased television and film distributor Leo A. Gutman, Inc. whose titles included the theatricals &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; and the Sherlock Holmes and East Side Kids series; and two 1960s television westerns, &quot;Branded&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot;.

In 1986, King World signed Oprah Winfrey to a syndication deal and agreed to distribute her Chicago-based daytime talk program nationally, resulting in the premiere of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in September of that year. The acquisitions paid off, and &quot;Oprah&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; became three of the most popular shows in the history of television syndication, drawing high ratings consistently well into the 21st century. In particular, the success of &quot;Oprah&quot; eventually led to the creation of the spin-off series &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, &quot;Rachael Ray&quot;, and &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;.

===Other acquisitions===

On February 11, 1985, King World formed the King World Enterprises division to develop joint-venture programs with advertisers and station groups and to handle international distribution for King World and Camelot. In 1987, King World&#x27;s Camelot Entertainment Sales entered into an agreement with Buena Vista Television, whereas Camelot would sell all national spots for all programming produced by Buena Vista Television, which included &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, &quot;DuckTales&quot;, &quot;Disney Magic I&quot; and &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, and Camelot was willing to accept the lower figure because &quot;DuckTales&quot; represented King World&#x27;s first foray into the animated strip business, and &quot;Disney Magic I&quot; marked King World to the barter movie operation business for the first time.

In 1988, the company made its only foray onto television stations when it bought out WIVB-TV in Buffalo for $100 million. King World ended up selling the station to LIN TV Corporation in 1995.

====Former King World-owned stations====
Stations are arranged in alphabetical order by state and city of license.
===1990s: King World Direct and KWP===
In the 1990s, King World operated an &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; VHS service called King World Direct.

Stuart Hersch, a lawyer by trade, was the financial expert who helped to take the company public, making it one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street at the time. The company traded as &quot;KWP&quot;. King World had virtually no debt and generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues after going public. 

Television stations that broadcast King World programming had first choice on any series King World offered to distribute.

On November 25, 1991, King World acquired the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; format rights from Orion Pictures after Orion closed down its television division. In 1995, it made a partner deal with Columbia TriStar Television to launch game shows.

In 1996, King World began co-distributing &quot;Geraldo&quot; (later &quot;The Geraldo Rivera Show&quot;) with Tribune Entertainment, and would continue co-distributing the show until its cancellation in 1998.

On September 28, 1998, King World acquired the worldwide leasing rights to the solo-developed game shows by Merrill Heatter Productions for a limited time.

===Acquisition by CBS===
In April 1999, King World was acquired by CBS. On January 19, 2000, &quot;Eyemark Entertainment&quot;, the successor to Westinghouse Broadcasting following the CBS/Westinghouse Electric Corporation merger, was folded into King World. The sale was first discussed on March 28, 1999, for $3 billion. After CBS purchased King World, CBS was bought by Viacom outright in 2000; such buyout was reversed at the end of 2005, when King World became part of the post-split CBS Corporation as well as all of Viacom&#x27;s former television production and distribution operations.

In its latter days, King World was considered the syndication branch of the CBS network (a role Viacom actually first served upon its creation), having succeeded Eyemark in that role. King World, however, distributed newer CBS shows such as &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; while the older shows were syndicated by corporate affiliate CBS Paramount Television, the successor to the original distributor Viacom Enterprises. Additionally, from 2000 to 2006, King World distributed archive programs from Group W, such as &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;.

On September 26, 2006, CBS announced that King World and CBS Paramount Television&#x27;s syndication operations would be combined to form the CBS Television Distribution Group (CTD). Roger King was announced as CEO of the new entity and retained that position until suffering a stroke on December 7, 2007, and dying the next day. Paul Franklin currently serves as President of CTD.

For one year, the King World on-screen identity was kept for the programs it distributed at its closure. However, most of the programs handled by King World were distributed under CTD. On September 27, 2007, CBS Television Distribution introduced a new closing logo to replace the old logos of King World, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, and its predecessors. CBS Television Distribution was renamed CBS Media Ventures in 2021.

==Programming==
King World was responsible for the highest rated shows in syndication for over two decades. They also had the television rights to a large library of theatrical films. When it was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 2000, it distributed a number of CBS-produced series for syndication, such as &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; (ancillary rights to this series are owned by HBO), &quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. King World turned part of its attention to producing in-house newsmagazines including &quot;American Journal&quot; and &quot;Inside Edition&quot;.

<text>Bruce A. Peterson (May 23, 1933 – May 1, 2006) was an American aeronautical engineer, and test pilot for NASA.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Peterson was born on May 23, 1933. A native of Washburn, North Dakota, he attended the University of California at Los Angeles from 1950 to 1953, and California Polytechnic State University from 1958 to 1960. While at UCLA he held a job as an aircraft assembler for Douglas Aircraft Company. Peterson graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Cal Poly in 1960.

===Flight experience and NASA career===
Following attending UCLA, Peterson enlisted as a naval aviation cadet and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1954. He was released from active duty three years later. Upon receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Cal Poly, Peterson joined NASA in August 1960 as an engineer at the Dryden Flight Research Center. After graduating from the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (Class 62C) at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and transferring to flight operations in 1962, he was assigned as one of the project pilots on the Rogallo paraglider research vehicle (Paresev) program. He made his first Paresev research flight on March 14, 1962. He was injured when the craft crashed from a height of about 10 feet (3 m) during a ground tow flight. Always the consummate engineer, his first question after impact was, &quot;What happened to the lateral stick forces?&quot;

As a NASA research pilot, he flew a wide variety of airplanes, including the F5D-1, F-100, F-104, F-111A, B-52, NT-33A Variable Stability Trainer, the wingless lifting bodies and numerous general aviation aircraft as well as several types of helicopters and sailplanes.

On May 10, 1967, during the sixteenth glide flight of a lifting body Northrop M2-F2, a landing accident severely damaged the vehicle and seriously injured Peterson. After an extensive hospitalization, he recovered from his injuries but lost sight in one eye due to a secondary infection while in the hospital.
He also made 17 NASA M2-F1, 2 other M2-F2 and 1 Northrop HL-10 lifting body flights.

Portions of M2-F2 footage including Peterson&#x27;s spectacular crash landing were used for the 1973 TV movie and subsequent series, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; during the opening credits of every episode. Peterson complained he disliked having his accident repeatedly replayed on television so often.

Despite his injuries, Peterson continued to fly NASA support missions, occasional research flights and continued his Marine Reserve flying duties until 1971. During his flying career, Peterson logged more than 6,000 flight hours in nearly 70 types of aircraft.

Peterson continued at Dryden as a research project engineer on the F-8 Digital Fly-By-Wire program of the late 1960s and early 1970s. He later assumed responsibility for safety and quality assurance for Dryden until his retirement in 1981.

===Post-NASA career===
He then joined the Northrop Corporation, where he assumed responsibility for safety and quality assurance for testing the B-2 Advanced Technology Bomber. From 1982 until 1994 Peterson worked in Northrop&#x27;s B-2 division (Advanced Systems Division) in Pico Rivera, California, at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, and at Edwards Air Force Base, becoming manager of system safety and human factors.

===Later life and death===
Peterson resided in Orange County, California, and Ocean Springs, California, until his death on May 1, 2006, at age 72, after a long illness.

==Organizations and special honors==
Peterson was a fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and 2002 recipient of the Tony LeVier Flight Test Safety Award. He was honored by NASA with an Exceptional Leadership Award for his work on preparations for the first Space Shuttle landing at NASA Dryden in April 1981. In 2003 he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor in Lancaster, California.

<text>SuperValu is a chain of franchised and independent grocery stores in Canada that currently operates in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.

== Background ==

Founded in British Columbia in 1951 by Loblaw Companies Limited as a chain of independently-owned supermarkets supplied by Loblaws&#x27; wholesale subsidiary, Kelly Douglas &amp; Company. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, many SuperValu stores were created from former Loblaws corporate stores as the banner expanded across western Canada. Loblaw Companies Limited (through its Westfair Foods division) still supplies SuperValu stores and owns the SuperValu name.

In the mid-1970s, a larger version of SuperValu was created - dubbed the Real Canadian Superstore, these warehouse-sized grocery stores were closer to department stores in scope. Today, only a handful of smaller SuperValu stores remain, all in British Columbia. Most others have either been rebranded to other Loblaw banners, such as Extra Foods, Your Independent Grocer or expanded into Real Canadian Superstore outlets (or the related Real Canadian Wholesale Club). Atlantic SuperValu stores have since been replaced by the larger Real Atlantic Superstore.

<doc id="1062573" wikidata="Q7239033" url="?curid=1062573" title="Prayer in Hinduism">
<text>Prayer () is considered to be an integral part of the Hindu religion; it is practiced during Hindu worship (&quot;puja&quot;) and is an expression of devotion (&quot;Bhakti&quot;). The chanting of &quot;mantras&quot; is the most popular form of worship in Hinduism. The Vedas are liturgical texts (mantras and hymns). Stuti is an umbrella term for religious literary creations, but it literally means &quot;praise.&quot;

The Hindu devotional Bhakti traditions place a focus on repetitive prayer, known as japa. Prayer is centred on the personal forms of gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu&#x27;s avatars, most notably Rama and Krishna, Shiva, or Shiva&#x27;s sons such as Kartikeya and Ganesha, as well as Mahadevi, the supreme goddess, and her forms, such as Lakshmi or Kali. 

The human aspire to the highest truth, the underlying monism of Hinduism, pertaining ultimately to the one Brahman, began before the ritual process, before the invocation of diverse deities for the fulfilment of varied needs. The Gayatri Mantra was part of all Vedic ceremonies and is still invoked in Hindu temples all over India and other countries around the world today, exemplifying its essence.

== Bhakti yoga ==
Described in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, &quot;bhakti yoga&quot; is the path of love and devotion. On &quot;bhakti yoga&quot;:
It is essentially the process of enlightenment found through worship of the Devas (or Devi, the feminine form of Deva), in whatever form one envisions. Prayer is achieved through &quot;puja&quot; (worship) done either at the family shrine or a local temple. We can see from Krishna&#x27;s injunction that prayer is fundamental to Hinduism, that to dwell constantly on the Divine is key to enlightenment. Prayer repetition (through mantras) using &quot;mala&quot;s (Hindu prayer beads) are a strong part of Hinduism.

The devotionalist Bhakti movement originates in South India in the Early Middle Ages, and by the Late Middle Ages spread throughout the subcontinent, giving rise to Sant Mat and Gaudiya Vaishnavism.

== Mantras ==
=== Gayatri mantra ===

The Gayatri mantra is Hinduism&#x27;s most representative prayer. Many Hindus recite it on a daily basis, not only contemplating its straightforward meaning, but also dwelling on and imbibing its sound, regarded to be pregnant with spiritual meaning. For this reason nearly all Hindu prayers and mantras are sung. The Gayatri mantra was first recorded in the Rigveda which was composed in Sanskrit about 2500 to 3500 years ago, and by some reports, the mantra may have been chanted for many generations before that.

<doc id="1062578" wikidata="Q470044" url="?curid=1062578" title="The Other Boleyn Girl">
<text>The Other Boleyn Girl (2001) is a historical novel written by British author Philippa Gregory, loosely based on the life of 16th-century aristocrat Mary Boleyn (the sister of Anne Boleyn) of whom little is known. Inspired by Mary&#x27;s life story, Gregory depicts the annulment of one of the most significant royal marriages in English history (that of King Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon) and conveys the urgency of the need for a male heir to the throne. Much of the history is highly distorted in her account.

Reviews were mixed; some say the book was a brilliantly claustrophobic look at palace life in Tudor England, while others are troubled by the lack of historical accuracy.

The novel was twice adapted into films of the same name.

It was followed by a sequel called &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Fool&quot;, set during the reign of Henry&#x27;s daughter, Queen Mary. &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Fool&quot; was followed by &quot;The Virgin&#x27;s Lover,&quot; set during the early days of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign.

==Plot==
In 1521 England, Queen Catherine of Aragon&#x27;s failure to provide King Henry VIII a male heir has strained their marriage. Thomas Boleyn and his brother-in-law, Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, plan to install Boleyn&#x27;s youngest daughter Mary, wife of courtier William Carey, as the king&#x27;s mistress. Mary&#x27;s sister Anne, who recently returned from the French court, and brother George help Mary prepare, and Henry soon takes a liking to Mary, who despite her devotion to Queen Catherine falls in love with Henry. The affair strains Mary&#x27;s friendship with the queen, especially after Mary becomes pregnant by the king.

Henry rewards Mary&#x27;s family with lands and titles, elevating their status amongst the other noble families of the royal court. Anne catches the eye of Henry Percy, heir presumptive to the Duchy of Northumberland, and marries him in secret. Percy, however, is set to marry Mary Talbot, the daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey has the marriage annulled and &quot;restores&quot; Anne&#x27;s virginity. She is sent away from court to their estate, Hever Castle as punishment.

Mary gives birth to a daughter in 1524 and names her Catherine. The king is somewhat indifferent to their daughter, who is presented as Mary&#x27;s child with her husband, and they continue their affair. George reluctantly marries lady-in-waiting Jane Parker, and eventually admits to his sisters that he has romantic feelings for a man: Sir Francis Weston. Mary becomes pregnant by the king again, and her family returns Anne to court so that she can maintain the king&#x27;s interest until the baby is born. Instead, Anne succeeds as seducing the king away from Mary just as she gives birth to a son, who is also presented as her husband&#x27;s child.

The family&#x27;s attentions shift to supporting Anne, who the king now favors. She resists his desires to make her his mistress, instead pressuring him to set Queen Catherine aside and marry her instead. Mary reconciles with her husband, William, and they share a brief period of happiness before he dies from the sweating sickness. She continues to support Anne, but longs to be with her children at Hever, which she is only permitted to visit each summer. Mary observes as Anne, for seven long years, strives to maintain the king&#x27;s interest.

Eventually, Queen Catherine stands trial for the validity of her marriage to Henry. The king believes she consummated her previous marriage with his dead brother, Prince Arthur, and did not come into their marriage a virgin. The Queen is banished, and Anne, now engaged to marry Henry, adopts Mary&#x27;s son to ensure she has a male heir to the throne.

Anne suffers a decline in popularity during her travels abroad, culminating in the King and Queen of France, who do not tolerate her position, refusing to meet her. She eventually sleeps with Henry after he grants her a title and marries him when he installs a new archbishop and proclaims himself Head of the Church of England. Anne gives birth to a daughter in 1533, whom she names Elizabeth. Anne, however, starts to lose the king&#x27;s favor after several miscarriages and stillbirths.

Mary begins a relationship with Essex landowner William Stafford, despite their difference in rank. She marries him in secret and only tells her family when she becomes pregnant and can no longer hide the truth. Anne reacts with anger, jealous of Mary&#x27;s pregnancy after her own repeated miscarriages and stillbirths.

Henry suffers an injury to his leg while jousting in 1536, and his time recovering stokes worries that public sentiment is turning. Meanwhile, Anne grows increasingly paranoid, convinced she has lost the support of her family and the country and that Henry is in love with her lady-in-waiting, Jane Seymour. She rejoices in her new pregnancy after hearing news of Queen Catherine&#x27;s death. Mary meanwhile notices Anne&#x27;s closeness with George, especially after Anne suffers another stillbirth and the child is deformed, leading to suspicions of incest or witchcraft.

Mary makes plans with William to travel for the country to avoid the turmoil. Before they can do so, Henry places Anne and George under arrest on charges of adultery and incest due to widespread belief that they slept together to give Anne her much-needed son. Anne later presents herself before the Privy Council, which finds her guilty. George and Weston are also convicted and beheaded.

Mary attends Anne&#x27;s execution, believing that the king will spare her sister and send her to a nunnery, but Henry does not appear and her sentence is not commuted. Anne is executed and Mary swiftly leaves London with her husband and children.

==Characters== 
* Mary Boleyn/Carey/Stafford: The main character of the story, told from her point of view. Mary is portrayed as an innocent, sexually naïve, young girl who, forced by her family, engages in an affair with Henry VIII under the influence of her sister Anne and her brother George. The novel begins when Mary is thirteen and ends just days after Anne&#x27;s execution.
* Anne Boleyn: Anne is Mary&#x27;s elder, more ambitious, sister (although research suggests that she was the younger of the two girls). Anne makes her first appearance at the beginning of the story when she is fifteen. At first, she is instructed to guide Mary in seducing Henry, but later steals Henry&#x27;s affections when she aims to overthrow Catherine as queen. Anne is portrayed as coldhearted and selfish, but will occasionally show affection to Mary and her family.
* George Boleyn: George is the eldest Boleyn child, and eventually Viscount Rochford. He is shown as caring and supportive to Mary, particularly when she is forced to stop her affair with Stafford. It is implied that he is sexually attracted to Anne, and is conducting an affair with Francis Weston. At the end of the book, George is executed, along with the others accused of committing adultery with Anne.
* Henry VIII: King of England, Henry first beds Mary, but is diverted by Anne, who refuses him sexual favors unless he makes her Queen. Though well-meaning, Henry is shown to be easily persuaded by Anne, and quick-tempered.
* William Carey: Mary&#x27;s first husband, he dies half-way through the story from an outbreak of the sweating sickness.
* William Stafford: Mary&#x27;s second husband who pursues Mary, and on the voyage to France, the two begin an affair. Later in the novel, they are married in secret, and have one daughter together, Anne (named in honor of the Queen). William genuinely loved Mary, and her two elder children, and was willing to help her retrieve her son Henry from Anne&#x27;s wardship. At the end of the novel, she and William leave for the country with the three children.
* Catherine of Aragon: Queen Consort of England, she has been married to Henry VIII for two decades but they have only one daughter together. A strict Catholic, she puts religious pressure on the King to not divorce her.

==Adaptations==
* &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2003), telefilm directed by Philippa Lowthorpe
*: A 90-minute television drama based on the novel was broadcast by the BBC in 2003. It had a relatively low production budget of £750,000 and was filmed using modern camera techniques, with much of the script improvised. Jodhi May played Anne Boleyn, Natascha McElhone played Mary, Steven Mackintosh played George, Jared Harris played Henry VIII, and Philip Glenister played Stafford. It received mixed reviews.
* &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008), film directed by Justin Chadwick
*: A 2008 feature film adaptation starred Scarlett Johansson as Mary, Natalie Portman as Anne, Jim Sturgess as George, Eric Bana as Henry VIII and Eddie Redmayne as Stafford. In &quot;Translating Henry to the Screen&quot;, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, screenwriter Peter Morgan discusses the dilemma he faced in adapting Philippa Gregory&#x27;s 600-plus-page novel for the screen. He ultimately decided to use it merely as a broad guideline for his script, which Gregory felt perfectly captured the essence of her book, although many plot elements were eliminated, diminished, or changed. Among the more notable deviations in the film, Mary&#x27;s marriage to William Stafford, a major part of the book, is mentioned only in a note just before the closing credits, there is no mention of Anne&#x27;s &quot;stealing&quot; Mary&#x27;s son to keep a grip on the king&#x27;s favour (there was a scene designed to vaguely cover that, but it was cut from the film), Anne becomes pregnant with Elizabeth after being raped by Henry, Anne and George decide against committing incest, Mary adopts Elizabeth at the end of the film. In addition to this, the character of Elizabeth Boleyn is almost the opposite of that in the book and she is portrayed as protective of her daughters against their father and uncle and critical of the family&#x27;s social climbing at the expense of their moral integrity.

<text>Bargello is a type of needlepoint embroidery consisting of upright flat stitches laid in a mathematical pattern to create motifs. The name originates from a series of chairs found in the Bargello palace in Florence, which have a &quot;flame stitch&quot; pattern.

Traditionally, Bargello was stitched in wool on canvas. Embroidery done this way is remarkably durable. It is well suited for use on pillows, upholstery and even carpets, but not for clothing. In most traditional pieces, all stitches are vertical with stitches going over two or more threads.

Traditional designs are very colourful, and use many hues of one colour, which produces intricate shading effects. The patterns are naturally geometric, but can also resemble very stylised flowers or fruits. 

== Alternative names ==
A number of alternative names are used by different scholars, including:

*Florentine work - after the fact that the Bargello Museum is in Florence.
*Hungarian point (&quot;punto unghero&quot;) - in Italian, Bargello is known as &quot;Hungarian Point&quot;, indicating that the Florentines believed the technique originated in Hungary. However, English embroidery vocabulary also includes a diamond-shaped stitch called Hungarian point, so few English-language books use this term to refer to Bargello.
*Flame stitch (&quot;punto fiamma&quot;) - a type of Bargello motif in which zig-zag or flames are created. The chairs in the Bargello Museum do use flame stitch motifs, but curved motifs are also common (see below). These curved Bargello motifs would normally &quot;not&quot; be &quot;flame stitch&quot;, but would be called &quot;Bargello&quot;.
*Irish stitch - a term found in early modern British sources, equated with Bargello. Lady Anne Clifford mentioned working Irish stitch cushion covers in her diary.
Because of the potential for confusion, most books written in English refer to the technique simply as &quot;Bargello&quot;.

== History ==
As with many traditional crafts, the origins of Bargello are not well documented. Although early examples are from the Bargello Museum in Florence, there does exist documentation that a Hungarian connection is possible. For one thing, the Bargello Museum inventory identifies the chairs in its inventory as &quot;17th century with backs and seats done in &quot;punto unghero&quot; (Hungarian Point)&quot;. In the 18th century, Queen Maria Theresa of Hungary stitched Bargello and her work has been preserved in the Hungarian National Museum.

Petschek also cites legend of Hungarian noblewomen practicing the craft, including a Hungarian princess marrying into the de Medici family, and a princess Jadwiga (Hedwig) of Hungary who married into the Jagiełło dynasty of Poland.

It is unknown if those were distinct developments or if they influenced each other. Both Bargello and Hungarian Point tend to be colorful and use many hues of one color, which produces intricate shading effects. The patterns are naturally geometric, but can also resemble very stylized flowers or fruits.

==Bargello technique==
Bargello refers not to just a stitching technique, but also to motifs created by the change of colors in the stitches. This section describes the vertical stitch, and how it is combined with color and &quot;stepping&quot; to create different motifs.

===Vertical stitches===
Most agree that traditional Bargello pieces incorporate a series of all vertical stitches (vs. diagonal stitches). The basic unit is usually a vertical stitch of four threads, but other heights are possible.

Some Bargello pieces use only one height of stitch, but even the earliest pieces (such as chairs in the Bargello museum) combine different heights of stitches.

===Stepping===
Bargello patterns are formed when vertical stitches are stepped, or offset vertically, usually by two threads (i.e., halfway down a unit of four threads). The patterns in the steps combined with color changes determines how the overall pattern will emerge.

===Flame (sharp) vs. curved motifs===
If vertical stitches are stepped down quickly, the design forms sharp points or zig-zags. This type of Bargello motif is often known as flame stitch. Flame stitch can be found on the Bargello Museum chairs.

If steps are gradual, then the design will appear to be curved. Traditional curved Bargello motifs include medallions and ribbons.

===Traditional Bargello motifs===
There are many identified motifs possible, but some common ones include:

====Flame zigzag (sharp)====
Stitches step sharply across the design.

====Diamonds (sharp)====
Stitches step sharply across the designs and color changes cause diamonds to appear.

====Ribbons (curved)====
Stitches are gradually stepped in different colors.

====Medallions (curved)====
Stitches are gradually stepped and color changes cause spheres or medallions to appear.

== Modern Bargello ==
Since the revival of Bargello in the 1960s, the technique has evolved in different directions. Although traditional Bargello is still stitched, modern designers have expanded the repertoire of design possibilities.

===Four-way and eight-way Bargello ===
Traditional Bargello is executed with just a vertical stitch in one direction, but Dorothy Kaestner created a style of Bargello called four-way Bargello. In this technique, the canvas is first divided diagonally into quarters. Then the same motif is worked in horizontal stitches in two opposite areas, and vertical stitches in the remaining two areas. The resulting design frequently resembles a kaleidoscope effect.

Kaestner describes the origin of the technique:

This concept has been expanded to eight-way Bargello, or Bargello stitches in eight directions (horizontal stitches, vertical stitches and diagonal stitches).

===Bargello band samplers===
Designers of band samplers may include a band of a Bargello motif among other sampler stitches. Unlike traditional Bargello, these bands are stitched with the same stranded cotton, silk or linen embroidery thread used in band samplers.

===Bargello quilts===
In addition to Bargello embroidery, there are now Bargello quilts in which the patterns used in Bargello embroidery are constructed with strips of fabric of the same height but different widths.

Bargello quilts are strip-pieced; the fabric is cut into long strips and sewn together in graduated color groups. The strips are cut into rows of squares and rectangles, and sewn together to form different patterns.

<text>Claverton Pumping Station in the village of Claverton, in the English county of Somerset, pumps water from the River Avon to the Kennet and Avon Canal using power from the flow of the river. It is a Grade I listed building, having been upgraded from Grade II in 2019.

The pumping station was built by John Rennie between 1809 and 1813 to overcome water supply problems on the canal. It uses a wide wooden breastshot water wheel to drive two Boulton and Watt long cast iron rocking beams, which power lift pumps to raise water up to the canal. The pumping station has undergone several modifications since its initial construction, including revising the wheel into two sections each wide separated by a gap. The station&#x27;s operational life ended in 1952, by which time its maintenance and repair had become uneconomical in the light of falling traffic on the canal.

In the 1960s and 1970s restoration was carried out by students from the University of Bath and the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust, who replaced and repaired the buildings and equipment and returned the pumping station to a functional state by 1978. It is now owned by the Canal and River Trust and maintained by the Claverton Pumping Station Trust CIO, open to the public as an industrial heritage museum.

==Description==

At Claverton, the Kennet and Avon Canal is cut into the side of the Avon valley above the River Avon. The pumping station is in a pump house built of Bath Stone, which is at river level and separated from the canal by the Wessex Main Line. It was designed by John Rennie and built by Fox of Bristol. The pump house has a slate hipped roof. The wheelhouse projects to the west of the pump house and has weatherboard sides. The east gable wall has three doors allowing access to the wheel itself.

Water is diverted from the river by Warleigh Weir, about upstream. The water flows to the pumping station down a wide leat, which is crossed by a single segmental arch bridge with a central keystone. The water passes over depressing sluices which can be raised or lowered by hand cranking, and then powers a breastshot water wheel. The wide wheel is in two sections, each wide and in diameter, with a gap between them. The wheel has 48 wooden starts on each of the six cast iron rims. These starts support 96 float boards each of which is by by , and is paired with a seal board bolted directly to the rim. The original timber selection for the wheel is not known, but since 1983 the starts have been made from Iroko due to its longevity even in conditions where it is cycled between submerged and dry due to intermittent running. The breastshot wheel is vertically mounted, and falling water strikes the blades. Breastshot wheels are less efficient than backshot or overshot wheels, but more efficient than undershot wheels.

At full power the wheel uses 2 tons (2 tonnes) of water per second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives a flexible coupling to a pit wheel with a diameter of , which has 408 (204 pairs) hand-fitted wooden teeth that mesh with a cast iron gear, increasing the speed to 16 rpm. From there, cranks drive vertical connecting rods that transfer the energy to two long cast iron rocking beams made by Boulton and Watt. Each beam drives an diameter lift pump, which also takes its supply from the mill leat. Each pump stroke raises 50 imperial gallons (230 litres) of water to the canal via of diameter cast iron pipe. With the sluice fully depressed the flow is 73 ft3/s and due to the build-up of spent water in the tail-race the working head is reduced to , giving a potential power of 34 hp. The output power, calculated from the water lifted into the canal per minute, is 24 hp representing an efficiency of 62%.

==History==

===Construction===

The idea of an east to west waterway link across southern England was first mentioned in Elizabethan times, between 1558 and 1603, to take advantage of the proximity of the rivers Avon and Thames, only apart at their closest. Plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century. In 1723 the Kennet Navigation through Reading opened. The Avon navigation from Bristol to Bath was opened in 1727. In 1788 the so-called &quot;Western Canal&quot; was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as Hungerford, Marlborough, Wiltshire, Calne, Chippenham and Melksham. The following year the engineers Barns, Simcock and Weston submitted a proposed route for this canal, although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply. The name was changed from Western Canal to Kennet and Avon Canal to avoid confusion with the Grand Western Canal, which was being proposed at the same time.

In 1793 a further survey was conducted by John Rennie, and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17 April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began.

The new route added several locks to the canal, making water supply problems more severe. Because of the way the system of locks works, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time a vessel passes. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into their upper parts, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station, to the east near Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal; it opened in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.

Protracted negotiations over water rights with the owners of Saltford Brass Mill and around 30 other mills on the river between Bath and Bristol delayed construction until 1809; the wheel was installed in March 1810. Further delays relating to obtaining specific items of machinery meant that the pumping station did not open until early 1813, and until then boats were prohibited from using Bath Locks during periods of low rainfall.

===Operation and decline===

The pumping station operated continuously, providing water for the increasing traffic on the canal. The width of the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added, dividing the wheel in two.

The opening of the Great Western Railway in 1841 led to a significant decline in the canal&#x27;s traffic, even though the canal company lowered tariffs. In 1852 the railway company took over the canal&#x27;s operation. In 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of £1,920 and never subsequently made a profit. The Somerset Coal Canal and Wilts &amp; Berks Canal, which each supplied some of the trade to the Kennet and Avon, including freight from the Somerset coalfield, closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. At Claverton various minor repairs were needed to the wheel and pump, and the wheel had to be levelled at regular intervals during the later part of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The 408 &quot;green oak&quot; teeth on the pit wheel also had to be replaced several times.

In 1926, following a loss of £18,041 the previous year, the Great Western Railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a Ministry of Transport Order, but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal. After the Second World War the Transport Act 1947 meant that control of the canal passed to the British Transport Commission, but by the 1950s large sections had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the Avoncliff Aqueduct. Claverton Pumping Station ceased operation in 1952, after the failure of a number of the pit wheel&#x27;s oak teeth. The British Transport Commission installed a centrifugal pump to maintain the statutory minimum water level.

===Restoration===

After its closure the pumping station lay derelict until the late 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of returning the pumping station to working order. Work started in 1969 with engineering students from Bath providing the labour under the supervision of John Butt, and the trust providing the funding. Within the building, rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To allow work on the sluices and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation at Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John Butt retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak teeth on the pit wheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The pumping station was formally re-opened in 1978.

In 1981, British Waterways installed two electric pumps and presented the old diesel pump to the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust for preservation. Wessex Water Authority agreed to the extraction of per day from the Avon at Claverton to be pumped east; the cost of the pumps was £175,000.

From 2012 to 2016 the pumping station underwent another restoration of the woodwork, which involved replacing all 288 starts on the waterwheel, and all 96 float and seal boards, as well as the 408 oak teeth of the pit wheel.

Claverton Pumping Station was awarded a National Transport Trust Red Wheel, recognising its historical importance to transport heritage in the United Kingdom. The restoration work received an Engineering Heritage Award from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and won first place in the Heritage and Conservation category of the Living Waterways Awards 2019.

== Present day ==
The pumping station is maintained by volunteers and is open regularly except during winter maintenance periods. Depending on volunteer numbers, the wheel may be either static or pumping. Pumping days are advertised in advance, but are always subject to river conditions and ageing machinery. There is also a working model of the pumping station in the pumphouse.

<doc id="1062599" wikidata="Q7889804" url="?curid=1062599" title="United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina">
<text>The United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (in case citations, E.D.N.C.) is the United States district court that serves the eastern 44 counties in North Carolina. Appeals from the Eastern District of North Carolina are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

== Jurisdiction and offices ==
The District has three staffed offices and holds court in six cities: Elizabeth City, Fayetteville, Greenville, New Bern, Raleigh, and Wilmington. Its main office is in Raleigh. It is broken down into four divisions. The eastern division is headquartered in Greenville and handles cases from Beaufort, Carteret, Craven, Edgecombe, Greene, Halifax, Hyde, Jones, Lenoir, Martin, Pamlico, Nash and Pitt counties.

The southern division is based in Wilmington and serves the counties of: Bladen, Brunswick, Columbus, Duplin, New Hanover, Onslow, Pender, Robeson, and Sampson. Its cases are heard in Wilmington.

The northern and western divisions are based in Raleigh. The western covers: Cumberland, Franklin, Granville, Harnett, Johnston, Vance, Wake, Warren, Wayne, and Wilson counties. Its cases are heard in Fayetteville, Greenville, and New Bern. The northern division presides over cases from: Bertie, Camden, Chowan, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Northampton, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell and Washington counties. Its cases are heard in Elizabeth City.

Pleadings are accepted for all divisions in any of the offices in Raleigh, Greenville, New Bern, or Wilmington.

== History ==
The United States District Court for the District of North Carolina was established on June 4, 1790, by . On June 9, 1794, it was subdivided into three districts by , but on March 3, 1797, the three districts were abolished and the single District restored by , until April 29, 1802, when the state was again subdivided into three different districts by .

In both instances, these districts, unlike those with geographic designations that existed in other states, were titled by the names of the cities in which the courts sat. After the first division, they were styled the District of Edenton, the District of New Bern, and the District of Wilmington; after the second division, they were styled the District of Albemarle, the District of Cape Fear, and the District of Pamptico. However, in both instances, only one judge was authorized to serve all three districts, causing them to effectively operate as a single district. The latter combination was occasionally referred to by the cumbersome title of the United States District Court for the Albemarle, Cape Fear &amp; Pamptico Districts of North Carolina.

On June 4, 1872, North Carolina was re-divided into two Districts, Eastern and Western, by . The presiding judge of the District of North Carolina, George Washington Brooks, was then reassigned to preside over only the Eastern District. The Middle District was created from portions of the Eastern and Western Districts on March 2, 1927, by .

On July 6, 2021, under Public Law 117-26, , portions of Hoke, Moore, Scotland, and Richmond counties within the Fort Bragg Military Reservation and Camp Mackall were transferred into the Eastern District from the Middle District to end the previous situation where Fort Bragg was covered by two different districts.

<text>The Iditarod River is a tributary of the Innoko River in the U.S. state of Alaska. The river begins north of Chuathbaluk and the Russian Mountains and flows northeast and then west to meet the larger river near Holikachuk.

Iditarod is an Anglicization of the Deg Hit’an (Athabascan) name for the river, &quot;Haiditirod&quot; or &quot;Haidilatna&quot;, which is probably an English version of the name of a village on the river, that may have corresponded with the village called Iditarod in the 1900s.

<doc id="1062610" wikidata="Q11127350" url="?curid=1062610" title="Rape Me">
<text>&quot;Rape Me&quot; is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It is the fourth song on the band&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in September 1993.

Often interpreted as a commentary on fame, &quot;Rape Me&quot; was written shortly before the release of the band&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, and was intended to be a lyrically literal anti-rape song. However, the song&#x27;s bridge was written several months later, and does contain lyrics that reference the struggles Cobain and his wife, Courtney Love, faced with the media following Nirvana&#x27;s mainstream success. The song&#x27;s title and lyrics led to MTV blocking Nirvana from performing it at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, before it had been released, and also contributed to &quot;In Utero&quot; initially not being sold by American big-box stores Walmart and K-Mart.

&quot;Rape Me&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in December 1993, packaged as a double A-side with &quot;All Apologies&quot;. It reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart, and was the band&#x27;s final single before Cobain&#x27;s suicide in April 1994.

==Early history==
&quot;Rape Me&quot; was written by Cobain on an acoustic guitar in Los Angeles in May 1991, around the time the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, was being mixed. It was first performed live on June 18, 1991, at The Catalyst in Santa Cruz. The earliest live versions of the song featured a guitar solo instead of a bridge.

The song&#x27;s lyrics led to controversy even before it had been officially released. The band had wanted to play it during their appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, but according to Nirvana manager Danny Goldberg in his 2019 Cobain biography &quot;Serving the Servant&quot;, MTV president Judy McGrath was worried that the song &quot;would make it seem like MTV was normalizing rape.&quot; Goldberg recalled reminding McGrath on the phone of Cobain&#x27;s &quot;commitment to feminism&quot; and assured her that &quot;Rape Me&quot; was an anti-rape song, like &quot;Polly&quot; on &quot;Nevermind&quot;, but said McGrath &quot;wasn&#x27;t having it&quot; and wanted the band to play their latest single, &quot;Lithium,&quot; instead. The band eventually agreed, but Cobain still played a few seconds of &quot;Rape Me&quot; at the start of the performance, which resulted in the live broadcast almost going to commercial. In &quot;Serving the Servant&quot;, Goldberg refuted common reports that the network threatened to fire Amy Finnerty, an MTV employee and friend of the band, or boycott other artists signed to Geffen Records, if Nirvana played &quot;Rape Me&quot;, saying that &quot;the MTV people were under a lot of pressure to get good ratings, but they weren&#x27;t bullies, just noodges.&quot;

&quot;Rape Me&quot; was first recorded in the studio in October 1992, during a two-day demo session with Jack Endino at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington. Two takes of the song were recorded, one of which was instrumental, the other of which featured lead vocals by Cobain and backing vocals by drummer Dave Grohl. Cobain was holding his then-infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain on his lap when he recorded his vocals on the second take, and she can be heard crying on the recording. This version of the song was released on the Nirvana rarities box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, in November 2004, and on the compilation album &quot;&quot; in November 2005.

The final studio version of &quot;Rape Me&quot; was recorded in February 1993 by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, for the band&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;. The instruments for the song were recorded on February 15. The following day, Cobain completed his vocals for the album during a reported six-hour session. 

According to Albini, Cobain&#x27;s screaming during the song&#x27;s ending was intentionally recorded so that it &quot;just overwhelms the band and becomes this really uncomfortable presence.&quot; However, the album&#x27;s more abrasive vocals in general were softened in the mastered version.

==Post-&quot;In Utero&quot;==
On September 25, 1993, the band performed the song, along with &quot;Heart-Shaped Box,&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at NBC Studios in New York City. It was the band&#x27;s first show with second guitarist Pat Smear. The song was again performed on television on February 4, 1994 for the show &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot; in Paris, France.

The final live performance of &quot;Rape Me&quot; was at Nirvana&#x27;s last concert, at Terminal 1 of Munich-Riem Airport in Munich, Germany on March 1, 1994.

==Composition and lyrics==

===Music===

The song&#x27;s instrumental opening bars, which feature Cobain using pick scratching while playing the verse chord progression, has led to frequent comparisons to the guitar riff of the band&#x27;s 1991 breakthrough single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot; Will Bryant of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;the four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous &#x27;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#x27; riff,&quot; while Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross described the song as having &quot;the same catchy soft/loud dynamic as &quot;Teen Spirit,&quot; which &quot;created a perfect Cobain aesthetic – beautiful, haunting and disturbing.&quot; &quot;Rape Me&quot; was written after &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; but before &quot;Nevermind&quot; had been released.

===Lyrics===

&quot;Rape Me&quot; is an anti-rape song, written from the point of view of the victim. As Cobain explained to &quot;Spin&#x27;s&quot; Darcey Steinke in 1993, &quot;It&#x27;s like she&#x27;s saying, &#x27;Rape me, go ahead, rape me, beat me. You&#x27;ll never kill me. I&#x27;ll survive this and I&#x27;m gonna fucking rape you one of these days and you won&#x27;t even know it. Gillian G. Garr described the song&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;part submissive invitation, part defiant taunt, a mix that confused and disturbed many listeners&quot;, and led to Cobain frequently having to explain the song&#x27;s meaning.

In a 1993 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Cobain addressed the song&#x27;s controversy, saying that he had &quot;gone back and forth between regretting it and trying to defend myself,&quot; and that he &quot;was trying to write a song that supported women and dealt with the issue of rape.&quot; As he explained to interviewer David Fricke:

When asked by MUCH&#x27;s Erica Ehm in an August 1993 interview how the band was helping to raise awareness about sexism, Cobain replied, &quot;By writing songs as blunt as &#x27;Rape Me.&#x27;&quot; He stated that the lyrics were meant to be so direct that no one could misinterpret the song&#x27;s meaning.

American musician Tori Amos commented on the song in a 1994 interview with the &quot;NME&quot;, saying that she &quot;thought it was very clear what it was about...It&#x27;s a defiant song. But the scariest thing to a rape victim are the words &#x27;rape me&#x27;. When I first heard it I broke out in a cold sweat, but when you get over that you realize he&#x27;s turning it back on people.&quot; In 1996, Jim Dillon, reverend of the hoaxical Church of Kurt Cobain, stated that &quot;in essence, the real message [of &quot;Rape Me&quot;] is one of a Christian theme – treat me the way you want me to treat you&quot;.

The song has also been interpreted as an attack on the press for its perceived mistreatment of Courtney Love. While most of the song was written before &quot;Nevermind&quot; was released, the bridge, which was written later, contains lyrics that address his occasionally contentious relationship with the press. As Cobain explained to Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad, &quot;It was actually about rape ... but now I could definitely use it as an example of my life for the past six months or year, easily.&quot; In line with this interpretation, Azerrad suggested that the chorus lyric &quot;I&#x27;m not the only one&quot; was Cobain&#x27;s way of saying that Love and their infant daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, were being hurt along with him by the press and public attention. According to Azerrad, the bridge lyric &quot;My favorite inside source&quot; was a reference to the manager of an unnamed Seattle band Cobain and Love suspected of being anonymously interviewed for a controversial &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; profile of the couple published in September 1992.

==Release==
&quot;Rape Me&quot; was released as a double A-side single with &quot;All Apologies&quot; on December 6, 1993 on CD, cassette, and 7&quot; and 12&quot; vinyl record formats. The single was not released commercially in the United States.

The song was relabeled &quot;Waif Me&quot; on the censored Walmart and Kmart version of &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in March 1994. The chain stores had originally refused to carry the album because of the song&#x27;s title, as well as the fetus collage on the back cover, which was also edited. Cobain had originally wanted to retitle the song &quot;Sexually Assault Me,&quot; but decided on the meaningless title &quot;Waif Me,&quot; knowing that another four-letter word was required in order to make a quick graphic change. The song&#x27;s uncensored title was listed in the booklet, and the recording remained the same. Cobain defended the band&#x27;s decision to release a censored version of the album by explaining, &quot;One of the main reasons I signed to a major label was so people would be able to buy our records at Kmart. In some towns, that&#x27;s the only place kids can buy records.&quot;

In November 1993, &quot;Rape Me&quot; was voted the third &quot;Most Wanted to be Heard&quot; song by listeners of the Hawaii Free Radio. In Israel, it was voted in at number 15 on the IBA&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Israel&quot; singles chart.
===Critical reception===

In his &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of &quot;In Utero&quot;, Fricke wrote that &quot;&#x27;Rape Me&#x27; opens as a disquieting whisper, Cobain intoning the title verse in a battered croon, which sets you up beautifully to get blind-sided by the explosive hook line.&quot; Phil Alexander of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; noted that &quot;Kurt kickstarts Rape Me with a familiar and doubtlessly intended …Teen Spirit shuffle...[and] ripple[s] with Kurt&#x27;s poignant observations, allowing fleeting glimpses at his anger and frustration without ever resorting to the trite and obvious.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;the gripping &#x27;Rape Me&#x27; opens with the chords of &quot;Teen Spirit&quot;...and builds into a furious rant with lyrics as dumb as anything on a death-metal anthem (&quot;My favorite inside source/I’ll kiss your open sores&quot;). All of this is more articulate than any Soundgarden lyric, but too often, Cobain just comes off sounding petulant.&quot;

===Criticism===

&quot;Rape Me&quot; has occasionally received criticism for its intentionally blunt handling of sensitive subject matter. John Mulvey of the &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;while you can&#x27;t doubt Cobain&#x27;s personal political correctness, there&#x27;s a distinct moral dubiousness about welding the words &#x27;RAPE ME!&#x27; to &quot;In Utero&quot;″s best sing-along chorus.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&#x27;s&quot; Will Bryant wrote that the song, despite its victim-empowering intent, &quot;comes off as a shallow and transparent attempt to court controversy.&quot;

In 2019, Jenna Bush Hager revealed that her father, George W. Bush, prior to becoming U.S. President, broke one of her Nirvana CDs due to the lyrics of &quot;a really bad song&quot; implied to be &quot;Rape Me.&quot;

===Legacy===

In 1999, &quot;Rape Me&quot; was voted number 90 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Rock Tracks Ever!&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 31 on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs, with Julianne Escobedo Shepherd calling it &quot;the closest to an actual Bikini Kill song that [Cobain] would ever write, using the lyrics as a woman-empowering taunt to show would-be rapists that their victims&#x27; spirits would not be tamped.&quot; In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it at number 17 on their list of &#x27;Nirvana&#x27;s 20 greatest songs&#x27;.

&quot;Rape Me&quot; was re-released on both of Nirvana&#x27;s greatest hits albums, &quot;Nirvana&quot; (2002) and &quot;Icon&quot; (2010).

==Music video==

According to a 1993 &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; article by Jim DeRogatis, Cobain was told that MTV were &quot;squeamish&quot; about a potential &quot;Rape Me&quot; music video, which played a role in the band&#x27;s decision to release &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; as &quot;In Utero&#x27;s&quot; lead single instead. As DeRogatis wrote, &quot;Rape Me&quot; was &quot;the catchiest [song] on the album; it isn&#x27;t hard to imagine it becoming a hit - and a Madonna-size scandal.&quot; 

Ultimately no music video was made for the song, although two treatments were published posthumously in Cobain&#x27;s &quot;Journals&quot; in 2002. They included scenes set in a prison, footage of flowers and seahorses as well as a man being prepared for a gynecological exam. A 23-page &quot;Rape Me&quot; music video script, listing Jeffery Plansker as director, sold on eBay in January 2003 for $620.

In 1999, the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; version of &quot;Rape Me&quot; began being aired as a music video on MTV2 to promote the album &quot;Saturday Night Live: The Musical Performances, Volume 2&quot;, on which it appeared as the opening track. Video of the performance was released on the DVD of the same name.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Rape Me&quot; was parodied by American animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the January 2008 episode, &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot;, which featured the song &quot;Shave Me&quot; being performed by Sadgasm, a grunge band fronted by lead character Homer Simpson, in the early 1990s. It also featured &quot;Shave Me&quot; later being parodied by guest star &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic as &quot;Brain Freeze&quot;.

In the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Hummels &amp; Heroin&quot;, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, and Butters perform a Barbershop Quartet cover of &quot;Rape Me&quot; for a retirement home.

In October 2021, the American drama &quot;Succession&quot; used &quot;Rape Me&quot; in the episode &quot;The Disruption&quot; when Kendall ordered his assistants to play the song on the speakers to counter Shiv addressing the sexual assault allegations towards Waystar Royco. Love praised the show&#x27;s use of the song in an Instagram post, saying that she had &quot;never been so proud of approving one of Kurt&#x27;s songs&quot; and that it was &quot;as if they truly understood&quot; the song&#x27;s meaning.

<text>Upper Hutt Posse (UHP) are a New Zealand hip hop group formed in Upper Hutt, Wellington, in 1985. Upper Hutt Posse are one of the earliest New Zealand hip hop groups, known for their fusion of rap and reggae in both English and Māori. Prominent members include DLT, Dean &quot;Te Kupu&quot; Hapeta and Teremoana Rapley.

After signing to Jayrem Records, Upper Hutt Posse released their first single, &#x27;E Tū&#x27;, in 1988, which paid homage to Te Rauparaha and the Ngāti Toa heritage of the Hutt Valley. Their debut album &quot;Against The Flow&quot; was released the next year, which brought them international recognition. The group then became closely associated with Moana and The Moahunters, of whom their key member Teremoana was also part of. The group&#x27;s single &#x27;Ragga Girl&#x27; appeared on the soundtrack the film &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot; in 1994. A new lineup of live musicians produced the 1995 album &quot;Movement in Demand&quot;, mixing their signature Hiphop style with their reggae roots. Subsequent albums increasingly featured the Māori language, such as &quot;Mā Te Wā&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Te Reo Māori Remixes&quot; in 2002, for which they won a Tui Award. In 2007 another &#x27;live&#x27; lineup was formed including Maaka McGregor (drums) who had performed live with the group at various gigs since 1995. In November 2018, Upper Hutt Posse were inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame - Te Whare Taonga Puoro o Aotearoa.

== History ==
UHP formed as a four-piece reggae band in 1985. Since their inception, Dean Hapeta (also known as D Word or Te Kupu) and the Posse have been fighting racial injustice through their music. In 1988 they released the first rap record and music-video in New Zealand, &quot;E Tū&quot;, through Jayrem Records. The song combined African American revolutionary rhetoric with an explicitly Māori frame of reference. It pays homage to Māori warrior chiefs resistant of British colonialism, Hōne Heke, Te Kooti, and Te Rauparaha.

Releasing their debut album, &quot;Against The Flow&quot; in 1989 through Southside Records, the group performed nationally and the following year in Sydney and then Detroit. &quot;Against The Flow&quot; consists of sequenced/programmed rap and reggae songs and a political slow jam titled &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, the unique lineup of two rappers, a reggae toaster, a female singer, a male singer, and a DJ allowed main songwriter D Word to compose without having to use &#x27;featured&#x27; vocalists outside the group. In 1990, the group toured &quot;marae&quot; (Māori community centres), and supported Public Enemy when they visited New Zealand, and performed with the ragga artist Macca B and the Zimbabwean group the Bhundu Boys in Australia. October 1992 saw the completion of a music-documentary, &quot;Solidarity&quot;, showing UHPosse&#x27;s visit to the U.S., co-directed by Dean Hapeta and Rongotai Lomas, the music-documentary was aired on TV ONE&#x27;s &quot;Marae&quot;. With the departure of Darryl Thompson around this time, and then Teremoana Rapley 1993, who became a member of Moana and the Moahunters, and a presenter on television series &quot;Mai Time&quot;, being joined later by MC Beware who had left the group in late 1989. D Word formed Kia Kaha Productions Ltd and continues up to the present day as the leader of UHP through various lineup changes. Upon the release of the movie &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, the group&#x27;s single &quot;Ragga Girl&quot; appeared on the soundtrack, with MC Wiya and D Word making cameo appearances. In 1993 UHP performed at the inaugural Polynesian Music Festival held in Rarotonga.

A new lineup in 1994 of live musicians produced the 1995 album &quot;Movement in Demand&quot;, mixing their signature Hiphop style with their reggae roots, and adding the distinctive raggamuffin rap of Wiya. In 2000 album &quot;Mā Te Wā&quot; saw the re-introduction of founding member Blue Dread, and also Katarina Kawana who had &#x27;jammed&#x27; with the group in their formative years in the mid 1980s. &quot;Mā Te Wā&quot; is a digital reggae album completely in the Māori language. In 2002 UHP released &quot;Te Reo Māori Remixes&quot;, a 10-track album of earlier favourites remixed and featuring only Māori-language lyrics. This album received a Tui Award at the 2003 NZ Music Awards for &#x27;Best Mana Māori Album&#x27;. In 2005, the group released a double album titled &quot;Legacy&quot; which includes two tracks performed by Te Kupu&#x27;s daughter Ātaahua, notably a Māori-language version of &quot;The Greatest Love of All&quot;. Disc One, &quot;Ngāti&quot; is predominantly in English language, while Disc Two, &quot;Huia&quot;, is all in Māori.

In 2007 another &#x27;live&#x27; lineup was formed including Maaka McGregor (drums) who had performed live with the group at various gigs since 1995, Dez Mallon (guitar) and Nathan Warren (bass), Te Kupu and MC Wiya made up the five core members at that time which also included additional musicians. In July 2008 the first recording session for a new &#x27;live band&#x27; studio album commenced at Trident Studio and in September 2008 &quot;Ka Whawhai Tonu Mātou&quot; from this first recording session was released digitally (alongside a music-video) as a special song denoting 20 years since the release of debut recording &quot;E Tū&quot;. While production continued for the live band album through 2009, production began also on a bilingual (Māori and English language) electronica album titled &quot;Tohe&quot; released in July 2010. Then in October 2011 the live band album &quot;Declaration of Resistance&quot; was released, featuring images on its front cover from Te Kupu&#x27;s six-part rap documentary &quot;Ngātahi – Know The Links&quot;. Supported by the most extensive touring by the band to date, with Te Kupu fronting the band on electric guitar and MC Wiya on bass (a significant revamp), performing with a fluid lineup of live musicians.

In November 2018 Upper Hutt Posse were inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame | Te Whare Taonga Puoro o Aotearoa. Te Kupu selected eighteen past and present band members, and additional musicians whose contributions to the group warranted their being recognised: Dean Hapeta, Matthew Hapeta, Aaron Thompson, Darryl Thomson, Bennet Pomana, Teremoana Rapley, Steve Rameka, George Hubbard, Earl Robertson, Kiki Marama, Taki Matete, Katarina Kawana, Ātaahua Hapeta-Taereau, Maaka McGregor, Emma Paki, Des Mallon, Jeff Henderson, Kevin Rangihuna.

In January 2019 the first recording session for the next UHP album is held with Earl Robertson drumming to music sequenced by Te Kupu, followed by further sessions with drummers Ruben Das Gonzales, and then Riki Gooch, as well as recording sessions held at Matakahi Studio with various live musicians pulled in by Te Kupu, who himself plays bass, guitars, piano, synthesizer, alto saxophone and percussion, creating what he says is probably &quot;the most musically-realised UHP album yet.&quot; 2021 will see &quot;Say Do Don&#x27;t Do People&quot; the first single released prior to the album.

<doc id="1062621" wikidata="Q1195923" url="?curid=1062621" title="General Electric LM2500">
<text>The General Electric LM2500 is an industrial and marine gas turbine produced by GE Aviation. The LM2500 is a derivative of the General Electric CF6 aircraft engine.

As of 2004, the U.S. Navy and at least 29 other navies had used a total of more than one thousand LM2500/LM2500+ gas turbines to power warships. Other uses include hydrofoils, hovercraft and fast ferries.

In 2012, GE developed an FPSO version to serve the oil and gas industry&#x27;s demand for a lighter, more compact version to generate electricity and drive compressors to send natural gas through pipelines.

==Design and development==

The LM2500 was first used on the US Navy in 1969, after the original FT-4 gas turbines experienced many technical problems. Later, they were used in US Navy warships in the of destroyers and the related , which were constructed from 1970. In this configuration it was rated to . This configuration was subsequently used into the 1980s in the s, and s. It was also used by one of People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s Type 052 Luhu Class Missile Destroyer (Harbin 112) acquired before the embargo.

The LM2500 was uprated to for the s, which were initiated in the 1980s and started to see service in the early 1990s, and the T-AOE-6 class of fast combat tanker.

In 2001 the LM2500 (20 MW) was installed in a sound-proof capsule in the South African Navy (Meko A-200 SAN) frigates as part of a CODAG propulsion system with two MTU 16V 1163 TB93 Propulsion Diesels.

The current generation was uprated in the late 1990s to over .

LM2500 installations place the engine inside a metal container for sound and heat isolation from the rest of the machinery spaces. This container is very near the size of a standard intermodal shipping container – but not the same, the engine size very slightly exceeds those dimensions. The air intake ducting may be designed and shaped appropriately for easy removal of the LM2500 from their ships.

The LM2500+ is an evolution of the LM2500, delivering up to or 28.6 MW of electric energy when combined with an electrical generator. Two of such turbo-generators have been installed in the superstructure near the funnel of &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest transatlantic ocean liner, for additional electric energy for the liner to reach higher sea speeds.. Celebrity Cruises uses two LM2500+ engines in their s in a COGAS cycle (actually COGES, as the turbines generate electricity rather than driving the shafts directly).

The LM2500 is license-built in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited; in Italy by Avio Aero; and in Japan by IHI Corporation. (Subsequent to the February 2024 reporting of an IHI company whistleblower; On April 24, 2024, IHI announced that investigation was underway by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of its subsidiary, IHI Power Systems Co., which had falsified its engine data since 2003, impacting over 4,000 engines globally.)

The LM2500/LM2500+ can often be found as turbine part of CODAG, CODOG, CODLAG propulsion systems or in pairs as powerplants for COGAG systems.

== Variants ==
The LM2500 is available in 3 different versions:
* The LM2500 delivers with a thermal efficiency of 37 percent at ISO conditions. When coupled with an electric generator, it delivers 24 MW of electricity at 60 Hz with a thermal efficiency of 36 percent at ISO conditions.
* The improved, 3rd generation, LM2500+ version of the turbine delivers with a thermal efficiency of 39 percent at ISO conditions. When coupled with an electric generator, it delivers 29 MW of electricity at 60 Hz with a thermal efficiency of 38 percent at ISO conditions.
* The latest, 4th generation, LM2500+G4 version was introduced in November 2005 and delivers 47,370 shp (35,320 kW) with a thermal efficiency of 39.3 percent at ISO conditions.
=== Derivatives ===
* The GE TM2500 is derived from the LM2500, and mounted on a trailer that makes it possible to move it to wherever 30 MW of temporary electricity generation is required. It can be installed and commissioned in 11 days.

==Specification==
The basic LM2500 has a single shaft gas generator derived from the CF6, comprising a 16 stage compressor driven by a two stage air-cooled HP turbine. The combustion chamber is annular. Shaft power is generated by a 6-stage power turbine mounted in the gas generator exhaust stream. Additional power is obtained from the LM2500+ by the addition of a zero stage to the compressor, making 17 stages in all.

<text>Yury Nikolaevich Tynyanov (; October 18, 1894 – December 20, 1943) was a Soviet writer, literary critic, translator, scholar and screenwriter. He was an authority on Pushkin and an important member of the Russian Formalist school.

Born in a Jewish community in the Russian Empire in modern-day Latvia, he moved to Saint Petersburg where he completed his education. During the 1920s in the Soviet Union, he published numerous novels, works, and movie scripts, as well as working as a translator. However, his health declined during the 1930s and he died in 1943 from multiple sclerosis.

== Early life and education ==

Yury Nikolaevich Tynyanov was born on 18 October 1894 in Rezhitsa, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire - modern day Latvia. Tynyanov was born in a Jewish community, but would go on to have little connections with his Jewish heritage. His father, Nikolai Arkadyevich Tynyanov, was a doctor while his mother, Sofya Borisovna Tynyanova (née Epshtein), was a co-owner of a tannery.

At age nine in 1904, Tynyanov attended the Pskov Provincial Gymnasium after he passed the entrance exams. With his brother, Tynyanov lived primarily in Pskov when he was attending the school, returning to Rezhitsa during the holidays via train to see his mother and sister, Lydia. He graduated in 1912 with a silver medal. Tynyanov then entered the Faculty of History and Philology of Saint Petersburg University.

In 1916, he married Leah Abelevna Zilber, the elder sister of his friend and well-known Russian author Veniamin Kaverin. During his time in university, Tynyanov frequented the Pushkin seminar held by a venerable literary academic, Semyon Vengerov.

=== Russian Civil War ===
When the February Revolution began in 1917, Tynyanov was in Petrograd with his wife and daughter, Inna Yuryevna Tynyanov. Leah and Inna went back to Pskov, while Tynyanov remained in Petrograd to continue his studies. In summer 1918, he went to Yaroslavl to visit his parents who been living in the city since 1915. The Yaroslavl Uprising and subsequent bombing by the Bolsheviks, destroyed parts of Yaroslavl, including Tynayanov&#x27;s library where he collected books since his time in Pskov and his diploma work on Küchelbecker. To see his wife and daughter, he crossed into lands occupied by Germans.

During the Civil War, he worked in several jobs. Along with his university studies, he began teaching literature at a school. He also lectured at the House of Arts and the House of Writers. He also served as a French translator and head of the Information Department of the Petrograd Bureau of the Commintern. In 1919, he graduated from university and found employment at the Department of Russian Literature.

== Career ==
At age 27 in 1921, Tynyanov became a professor at the Petrograd Institute of Art History. During this time, he also began teaching 18th to 20th century Russian poetry while also being part of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language. In 1921, he published his first book titled &quot;Dostoevsky and Gogol&quot; where he drew connections between the works of Dostoevsky and Gogol. In 1925, Tynyanov released his first novel called &quot;Kukhlya&quot;. He would then in 1927 publish another piece of historical fiction titled “The Death of Vazir-Mukhtar”. &quot;Archaists and Innovators&quot; was released in 1929.

Aside from writing novels, Tynyanov wrote the scripts of &quot;The Overcoat&quot; (1926), &quot;Asya&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Club of the Big Deed&quot; (1927) in collaboration with Y.G. Oksman. As a translator, he translated the poems of Heinrich Heine from German to Russian.
=== Later life and death ===
During the 1930s, Tynyanov began to slowly experience multiple sclerosis. In 1932, he began to write &quot;Pushkin&quot;. However, multiple sclerosis began to take it toll and he then required a cane to walk. By 1940, Tynyanov lost his ability to walk. He however continued writing on Pushkin and finished the 3rd part in 1943. Tynyanov died on 20 December 1943 in Moscow, aged 49.

== Legacy ==
On 28 May 1981, a museum dedicated to Tynyanov opened in his hometown in Rezekne Secondary School No.6. The museum was supported by Tynyanov&#x27;s friend Veniamin Aleksandrovich Kaverin, his sister Lydia and his daughter Inna. The museum continues to operate in Latvia.

==Major works==

In 1928, together with the linguist Roman Jakobson, he published a famous work titled &quot;Theses on Language&quot;, a predecessor to structuralism (but see Ferdinand de Saussure), which could be summarised in the following manner (from ref.):

:#Literary science had to have a firm theoretical basis and an accurate terminology.
:#The structural laws of a specific field of literature had to be established before it was related to other fields.
:#The evolution of literature must be studied as a system. All evidence, whether literary or non-literary must be analysed functionally.
:#The distinction between synchrony and diachrony was useful for the study of literature as for language, uncovering systems at each separate stage of development. But the history of systems is also a system; each synchronic system has its own past and future as part of its structure. Therefore the distinction should not be preserved beyond its usefulness.
:#A synchronic system is not a mere agglomerate of contemporaneous phenomena catalogued. &#x27;Systems&#x27; mean hierarchical organisation.
:#The distinction between langue and parole, taken from linguistics, deserves to be developed for literature in order to reveal the principles underlying the relationship between the individual utterance and a prevailing complex of norms.
:#The analysis of the structural laws of literature should lead to the setting up of a limited number of structural types and evolutionary laws governing those types.
:#The discovery of the &#x27;immanent laws&#x27; of a genre allows one to describe an evolutionary step, but not to explain why this step has been taken by literature and not another. Here the literary must be related to the relevant non-literary facts to find further laws, a &#x27;system of systems&#x27;. But still the immanent laws of the individual work had to be enunciated first.

Tynyanov also wrote historical novels in which he applied his theories. His other works included popular biographies of Alexander Pushkin and Wilhelm Küchelbecker and notable translations of Heinrich Heine and other authors.

<text>Strait Country is the debut studio album by American country music artist George Strait, released on September 4, 1981, by MCA Records. The album&#x27;s traditional country music approach—a mix of Texas honky tonk and the Bakersfield sound—presented a sharp contrast to the dominating trends within country music at that time. The album includes the singles &quot;Unwound&quot;, &quot;Down and Out&quot;, and &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinking You Want a Stranger (There&#x27;s One Coming Home)&quot;. The album peaked at number 26 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. &quot;Strait Country&quot; has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album was one of the first to be recorded and mixed digitally.

==Recording==
In January 1981, MCA Records offered Strait a single deal, agreeing to release one song as a single and provide the necessary promotion. If the single was successful in sales and radio play, then an album deal would be offered. On February 2, 1981, Groundhog Day, Strait entered The Waxworks recording studio in Berry Hill, Tennessee with producer Blake Mevis to record &quot;Unwound&quot;, a song written by an unknown songwriter named Dean Dillon and his writing partner Frank Dycus. Producer Mevis first heard the song through his music publisher, Tom Collins, who also sent it to Strait&#x27;s new manager, Erv Woolsey, offering to finance a demo session if Strait would record the song. Woolsey listened to Dillon&#x27;s rough demo of &quot;Unwound&quot; and knew immediately that the song could be a big hit and launch Strait&#x27;s career. Woolsey and Strait agreed to record the song. Three additional songs were recorded during that February recording session: &quot;Blame It on Mexico&quot;, &quot;Perfect Lie&quot;, and &quot;Nobody in His Right Mind Would&#x27;ve Left Her&quot;.

The &quot;Unwound&quot; single was released by MCA on April 23, 1981 and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart the week of May 16. It soon made it into the top ten. Strait would later remember the experience of hearing his first record on the radio while working on his ranch in San Marcos.
Several days after &quot;Unwound&quot; made it onto the charts, MCA offered Strait a recording contract and gave the go-ahead to proceed with the album. In early June, Strait returned to Nashville with the Ace in the Hole Band to perform every night throughout the week of June 7 at the Reflections Ballroom at the Radison Hotel. That same week, Strait spent his days at the Music City Music Hall recording studios in Nashville with Mevis and a group of session musicians recording the remaining songs for his first album. This early decision to use session musicians on his recordings rather than his touring band set a pattern that he would continue to follow throughout his career. One of the songs from the February session, &quot;Blame It on Mexico&quot;, was rerecorded during the June sessions and included on the album.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Strait Country&quot; was released on September 4, 1981 by MCA Records. To promote the album, Strait and the Ace in the Hole Band performed a series of shows and performed the new material. While eager to help publicize the album, Strait had a few ground rules that would remain in place throughout his career. First, he insisted that his private life remain private, and that his wife and family not be involved in press interviews and publicity events. Strait also insisted on remaining in Texas and not moving to the country music capital. In an early interview with Nashville&#x27;s &quot;Music City News&quot;, Strait confessed, &quot;If I find out later on that I have to move, well, I&#x27;ll certainly move. But I would hate to leave Texas.&quot; And finally, he insisted on remaining true to his identity, and refused to take off the hat, despite considerable pressure to do so. As unfashionable as it might have appeared in Nashville at the time, it was a part of his identity—of just being himself.

==Artwork and packaging==
&quot;Strait Country&quot; was released in vinyl format. The front cover photo was taken by Tom Wilkes showing Strait wearing a cream-colored straw cowboy hat, a Western shirt open at the neck, revealing a simple gold chain. Standing against a weathered fencepost, he&#x27;s shown looking up with a &quot;plaintive look in his eye&quot;. At a time when most country performers were wearing rhinestone outfits, leisure suits, and very few sporting cowboy hats, Strait comes across as &quot;real country, plain and simple&quot;. The back cover photo of the vinyl album shows the singer inside Gruene Hall, a Texas dance hall where he played during his early years. The photo was not included on the CD version. The back cover also contains track listing with songwriter credits, as well as music and production credits.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Strait Country&quot; received positive reviews upon its release in 1981. On the AllMusic website, it received four out of five stars. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted how &quot;startling&quot; this debut album was during a time when country music was dominated by country-pop crossover songs, outlaw country anthems, the urban cowboy trend, and the Alabama-style country-rock movement. In contrast, Strait ignored the trends and focused on traditional country music, &quot;drawing deep on honky tonk tradition, undeniably rooted in Texas but willing to wander outside of the Lone Star State&#x27;s borders&quot;. Strait displays his clear love for the music of Merle Haggard on &quot;Blame It on Mexico&quot;, produced with a &quot;light production sheen&quot; that makes it accessible and timely, and yet the singer&#x27;s &quot;delivery and attitude&quot; make it &quot;sound as pure country as the harder stuff&quot;. Erlewine observed:

Erlewine concluded that in addition to being influential, &quot;Strait Country&quot; is &quot;flat-out great, the beginning of a remarkable streak of continually satisfying albums from George Strait&quot;.

Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ rating, admiring Strait&#x27;s &quot;quiet honky tonk&quot; sound and &quot;pleasant baritone&quot;.

<text>The Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 () is a twin-barreled 23 mm autocannon developed in the Soviet Union, primarily for military aircraft use. It entered service in 1965, replacing the earlier Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 and Rikhter R-23.

The GSh-23 works on the Gast Gun principle developed by German engineer Karl Gast of the Vorwerk company in 1916. It is a twin-barreled weapon in which the firing action of one barrel operates the mechanism of the other. It provides a much faster rate of fire for lower mechanical wear than a single-barrel weapon.

Although it cannot match the sustained rate of fire of an electric Rotary cannon like the M61 Vulcan, it requires no external power source to operate, but is instead powered by the recoiling of the floating barrels, somewhat like the action of the German MG-42. The Gast principle has been little used in the West, but was used on a variety of weapons in the former Soviet Union.

The cannon comes in a basic GSh-23 variant, and the more popular GSh-23L (), differing mostly in adding a muzzle brake, lowering recoil force. This cannon was standard fit on late-model MiG-21 fighters (M, SM, MF, SMT, PFM, bis), all variants of the MiG-23, the SOKO J-22 Orao, the JF-17 Thunder, the HAL Tejas, the Aero L-39ZA Albatros and IAR 93, and the tail turrets of the Tupolev Tu-22M bomber and some late-model Tu-95MS and Tu-142M3. In the latter application, it had the unusual ability to fire infrared flares and chaff rounds, allowing it to function as both a weapon and a dispenser of anti-missile countermeasures. It is also mounted on late small series Mi-24VP helicopters (in the NPPU-23 movable mounting) and Polish W-3WA Sokół helicopter in fixed mounting. The cannon was also used on cargo aircraft; specifically, Russian/Soviet Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft were designed to accommodate twin GSh-23&#x27;s in a tail turret. An Il-76M with just such a configuration could be seen at the 2002 Ivanovo airshow.

Some second generation MiG-21 models could carry the GSh-23L in an under-fuselage gondola designated the GP-9, carrying the cannon and 200 rounds of ammunition; this was replaced by a more streamlined semi-conformal installation in later variants. There are also several gun pods available for mounting on external hardpoints: UPK-23 for air-to-air use, with one or two fixed GSh-23 guns and 200–400 rounds of ammunition, and SPPU-22 pods with traversable barrels for strafing, from 0° to −30° and carried 280 rounds of ammunition in each (they were most often carried by the Su-17/-20/-22 as well as the Su-25/-39 in pairs).

==Variants==
*Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L, is a modernized air-cooled version with a muzzle brake added to reduce recoil. Used on NPPU-23 helicopter turret.
*Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23V, is a water-cooled version of GSh-23L. Used on NPPU-23 helicopter turret.

<doc id="1062679" wikidata="Q1281056" url="?curid=1062679" title="James Fitz-Allen Mitchell">
<text>Sir James Fitz-Allen Mitchell (15 May 1931 – 23 November 2021) was a Vincentian politician who served as the second Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from 1984 to 2000 and as the second Premier of Saint Vincent from 1972 to 1974. He founded the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1975, and served as its president until 2000.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born in Bequia on 15 May 1931. He was the oldest of four children born to Captain Reginald and Lois Mitchell. Reginald was lost at sea during a January 1940 voyage in the Bermuda Triangle. Lois remarried Alfred Baynes of Saint Lucia, leaving the children with their paternal grandmother Sarah. Some time after Mitchell left Bequia to enter St. Vincent Grammar School, his grandmother died; his younger siblings then joined their mother in Saint Lucia.

After studying for three years at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad and Tobago, Mitchell entered the University of British Columbia in 1954. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agriculture in 1955, majoring in Plant Science, and continued for one year of graduate studies. After graduation, Mitchell worked as an agricultural research officer for the government in Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia, then joined the Ministry of Overseas Development in London as a scientific information officer. While in London, he married Patricia Mae Parker in 1965; they had three daughters.

== Political career ==
Mitchell initially entered politics in 1966 by winning a legislative seat as a candidate of the Saint Vincent Labour Party. He was the Minister of Agriculture from 1967 to 1972. In that year, Mitchell resigned from Labour and won re-election as an Independent. He then became Premier with the support of the People&#x27;s Political Party (PPP), serving from 1972 until 1974. After PPP leader Ebenezer Joshua withdrew his party&#x27;s support, Mitchell formed the Mitchell/Sylvester Faction together with former PPP ministers Othniel Sylvester, Alphonso Dennie, and others. Although Mitchell was the only successful Faction candidate in 1974, they reorganized and founded the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1975. 

Mitchell and the NDP became the main parliamentary opposition. He was appointed leader of the opposition from November 1982 to December 1983. He served until the NDP&#x27;s victory in the 1984 elections. Mitchell became Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs in July 1984 and was re-elected for a fourth successive term when his Party scored an 8–7 victory in the 1998 parliamentary elections.

Mitchell retired as Prime Minister and NDP President in 2000 but stayed on as Senior Minister until 2001. Mitchell was also foreign minister from 1984 until 1992 and a Privy Councillor beginning in 1985. He served as the Chairman of the OECS Authority in 1988, 1995, and 1996; at the 1995 meeting, Mitchell advocated for the inclusion of Barbados.

Mitchell led the Commonwealth observer team at the election in Lesotho in 2002. He also was a member of the InterAction Council.

==Political positions==
Mitchell endorsed the Grenadines becoming a separate nation from St. Vincent: in a 1984 election campaign speech, he opined that the incumbent government was continuing the colonial policy of favouring St. Vincent. He also supported greater political integration of Caribbean countries. In 1987, at the eighth conference of heads of government in the Caribbean Community, he stated, &quot;As I see it, we must have one flag, one anthem and freedom of movement of people, services and capital.&quot;

==Role as agronomist==
During his time as prime minister, Mitchell co-founded the Caribbean Agricultural Regional Development Institute (CARDI).

In his opening address at the 1st Caribbean Agricultural Technology Conference (CATC) held in St Vincent and the Grenadines in 2000, Mitchell emphasized that &quot;agriculture must thrive&quot; and overcome regional challenges. Using the regional banana industry as an example, he pointed out that disruptions would affect not only farmers, but also related sectors such as transportation. To aid the industry, Mitchell outlined his government&#x27;s policies to promote crop diversification as well as land redistribution to increase production.

Mitchell wrote on a variety of issues in agriculture and Caribbean society, included the topics of fungicide usage and land reform. His autobiography &quot;Beyond the Islands&quot; was published by Macmillan Caribbean in 2006.

==Illness, death and tributes==
On 31 October 2021, Mitchell was admitted to Milton Cato Memorial Hospital in Saint Vincent due to multiple illnesses, including gallstone, kidney failure and an enlarged prostate. He was later diagnosed with dengue fever. He was then flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown in Barbados for advanced medical treatment on 3 November 2021, and was additionally diagnosed with pneumonia. 

On 18 November 2021, he was transferred to Port Elizabeth Hospital in Bequia. He died there five days later, on 23 November, at the age of 90. Mitchell was the last living parliamentarian to have served at independence in 1979. The government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines announced three days of national mourning through 25 November, with flags flown at half-mast. A state funeral will be held at a later date.

The OECS flag was flown at half-mast, while CARICOM and other regional leaders paid tributes to Mitchell. Sir Kennedy Simmonds, former Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, recollected their collaborations for Caribbean integration.

<text>The Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) is an Indian food research institute and laboratory headquartered in Mysore, India. It is a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.

India is the world&#x27;s second largest food grain, fruit and vegetable producer, and the institute is engaged in research in the production and handling of grains, pulses, oilseed, along with spices, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, and poultry.

== Establishment ==
CFTRI was established on 21 October 1950, soon after the Dominion of India was constituted into a republic, under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, a research and development organisation co-founded by Sir A. R. Mudaliyar.

Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar donated Cheluvambavilas Palace and its vast campus to house the institute, where it is headquartered. It also has its resource centres at Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Mumbai, rendering technical assistance to numerous entrepreneurs.

== Institute ==
The institute has nearly two hundred scientists, technologists, and engineers, and over a hundred technicians, skilled workers, and support staff. There are sixteen research and development departments, including laboratories focussing on food engineering, food biotechnology, microbiology, grain sciences, sensory science, biochemistry, molecular nutrition, and food safety.

The institute has developed over 300 products, processes, and equipment designs, and most of these technologies have been released to over 4000 licensees for commercial application. . The institute develops technologies to increase efficiency and reduce post-harvest losses, add convenience, increase export, find new sources of food products, integrate human resources in food industries, reduce costs, and modernise. It holds several patents and has published findings in reputed journals.

<doc id="1062686" wikidata="Q5260777" url="?curid=1062686" title="Deposit market share">
<text>The deposit market share is a way of measuring the size and performance of a bank in the United States based on the banks total amount of deposits. It is the amount on deposit at a particular bank divided by the total amount on deposit at all banks.

In practice however, the term is used to refer to the deposit market share of commercial banks and savings and loan organizations calculated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC calculations do not include money deposited at credit unions, and the cash accounts at brokerage firms.

==Importance of this metric==
This metric is considered by many to be an important banking performance measure although many regard it as is misleading for the following reasons:

*FDIC insured deposits have been reducing since the early 2000s as bank customers have elected to put their funds into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and annuities. The amount in mutual funds is double the amount in bank accounts, the amount of money in Money Market Funds is the same as in checking accounts. These businesses are as profitable or even more so to the financial services company than normal bank accounts, so if customers are moving money from a particular bank&#x27;s normal bank accounts to bank-owned mutual funds, the bank does not lose anything. If one was only looking at deposit market shares however, it would appear to shrink.
*Deposit market share does not include credit unions.
*Deposit market share gives no indication as to how many other financial products and services a particular bank&#x27;s depositors might be buying from that bank. For example, Bank X might have a 10% deposit market share, yet if all those depositors simply have checking accounts and nothing else with that Bank, it would make nowhere near as much money as Bank Y in the same market, who might have 2% deposit market share yet successfully sell mutual funds, mortgages, and insurance.

==Use in antitrust proceedings==
When two banks merge, a survey is done to ensure that the combined deposit market shares will be no larger than 25% in a particular state, or 10% nationally. If one or both of those percentages are higher than allowed, the banks can elect to still do the merger but they would need to divest (i.e. sell off branches and customer accounts) enough branches to get them within the guidelines.

<text>The 1985 Tour de France was the 72nd edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours. It took place between 28 June and 21 July. The course ran over and consisted of a prologue and 22 stages. The race was won by Bernard Hinault (riding for the team), who equalled the record by Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx of five overall victories. Second was Hinault&#x27;s teammate Greg LeMond, ahead of Stephen Roche ().

Hinault won the race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey on the first day, in the opening prologue time trial, but lost the lead to Eric Vanderaerden () after stage 1 because of time bonuses. Hinault&#x27;s teammate Kim Andersen then took over the yellow jersey following a successful breakaway on stage 4. Hinault regained the race lead after winning the time trial on stage 8, establishing a significant lead over his rivals. However, a crash on stage 14 into Saint-Étienne broke Hinault&#x27;s nose, with congestion leading to bronchitis, which severely hampered his performances. Nonetheless, he was able to win the race overall ahead of teammate LeMond and Roche. For LeMond&#x27;s assistance, Hinault publicly pledged to support LeMond for overall victory the following year. The large amount of time trials in this edition of the race was decisive for its outcome, leading to a decrease in time trial kilometres for subsequent Tours.

In the Tour&#x27;s other classifications, Sean Kelly () won a record-equalling third points classification. The mountains classification was won by Luis Herrera (). LeMond was the winner of the combination classification, Jozef Lieckens () of the intermediate sprints classification, and Fabio Parra () was the best debutant, winning the young rider classification. won both the team and team points classifications.

==Teams==
The organisers of the Tour, the Société du Tour de France, a subsidiary of the Amaury Group, were free to select which teams they invited for the event. 18 teams with 10 cyclists on each started the race, meaning a total of 180 cyclists, which was a record number at the time. Of these, 67 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders in the race had an average age of 26.76 years, ranging from the 20-year-old Miguel Induráin () to the 38-year-old Lucien Van Impe (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest. Two former Tour winners, van Impe (who won in 1976) and Joop Zoetemelk of (who had won in 1980), both set a new record, by each starting in the race for the fifteenth time.

The teams entering the race were:

==Pre-race favourites==

Laurent Fignon () had won the previous year&#x27;s Tour de France, his second victory in a row, by a substantial margin of more than ten minutes ahead of Bernard Hinault (), a four-time winner of the Tour. However, he was unable to defend his title, as an operation on an inflamed Achilles tendon left him sidelined. According to Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot;, Fignon missing the race was well received, considering that otherwise the race was expected to be as one-sided as the year before.

In Fignon&#x27;s absence, Hinault was considered the clear favourite to achieve his fifth overall victory, which would draw him level with Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx for the record number of Tour de France wins. Hinault himself commented ahead of the prologue: &quot;If I sound sure of myself, it&#x27;s because I am.&quot; Earlier in the year, he had won the Giro d&#x27;Italia. Hinault&#x27;s team had been significantly strengthened for 1985, with the signings of Steve Bauer, Kim Andersen, and Bernard Vallet. The biggest addition to &#x27;s roster however was Greg LeMond. Having turned professional with alongside Hinault and Fignon in 1981, he had enjoyed a steady rise in the cycling world, including a win in the road world championship in 1983 and a third place in the previous year&#x27;s Tour. During that race, &#x27;s team owner Bernard Tapie had approached LeMond, offering him the highest-paid contract in cycling history to set him up as a successor to Hinault. LeMond was therefore considered &quot;the other choice as a possible winner&quot;. LeMond himself stated that he would work for Hinault, but that he did not doubt that Hinault would do the same for him should he lose his chances. Equally, Hinault declared before the start that either himself or LeMond would win. The amount of individual time trials, four stages totaling , was considered in Hinault&#x27;s favour, since he excelled at the discipline. Due to the race start in Brittany, Hinault&#x27;s home region and the large amount of time trialling, commentators jokingly referred to the edition as the &quot;Tour de Hinault&quot;.

The third highly ranked favourite was Phil Anderson (), who had just won both the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and Tour de Suisse, the most important preparation races for the Tour. Among the other favourites, there were mainly riders who were considered climbers, who ascended well up high mountains, but were inferior in time trials. These included Luis Herrera (), Robert Millar (), Peter Winnen (), and Pedro Delgado (). Other favourites included Ángel Arroyo (), Pedro Muñoz (), Claude Criquielion (), Stephen Roche (), and Sean Kelly (). Kelly was ranked number one in the UCI Road World Rankings, after taking victory at Paris–Nice and winning three stages of the Vuelta a España. His Irish compatriot Roche had displayed good form earlier in the year by winning the Critérium International and the Tour Midi-Pyrénées. Charly Mottet (), winner of the , considered the junior Tour de France, in 1984, was considered an outside bet for his team in the absence of team leader Fignon, given his young age.

==Route and stages==

The 1985 Tour de France started on 28 June, and had one rest day, in Villard-de-Lans. The race started in Brittany in North-West France, Hinault&#x27;s home region, with a prologue time trial in Plumelec. The route then headed north towards Roubaix, then south-east to Lorraine, then south through the Vosges and Jura mountains into the Alps for stages 11 through 13. From there, the Tour passed through the Massif Central en route to the Pyrenees for three high-mountain stages. After leaving the high mountains, the route moved north to Bordeaux, before travelling inland, with a time trial at Lac de Vassivière on the penultimate day, followed by a train transfer to Orléans for the final, ceremonial stage into Paris. It was the first time since 1981 that the Tour was run clockwise around France. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 17.

The 1985 Tour was the last one to contain split stages, where two stages on the same day had the same number and were distinguished by an &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Until 1991, there were still two stages held on the same day, but given separate stage numbers. It was also the first time that two mountain stages were held on the same day, stages 18a and 18b in the Pyrenees.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==
There were several classifications in the 1985 Tour de France, six of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist&#x27;s finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. There were two ways to gain time bonuses, which subtracted seconds from a rider&#x27;s overall time. One was at stage finishes, where the first three riders across the line received 30, 20, and 10 seconds bonus respectively. The split stage 18 awarded full-time bonuses for each of its two legs. Secondly, riders were able to gain 10, 6, and 3 seconds bonus for the first three to cross the line at intermediate sprints. Unlike the previous year, where these were only given out during flat stages, the time bonuses at intermediate sprints were awarded during every road stage of the 1985 Tour.

Additionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. The system for the points classification was changed for the 1985 Tour: in previous years, more points were earned in flat stages than in mountain stages, which gave sprinters an advantage in this classification; while in 1985, all stages gave 25 points for the winner, down to 1 point for 25th place. Unlike in many other years, between 1984 and 1986, intermediate sprints did not award points for this classification. Sean Kelly won the classification for a record-equalling third time. His 434 points were 69.4% of the maximum possible amount obtainable, a record .

There was also a mountains classification. The points system for the classification was changed: mountains in the toughest categories gave more points, to reduce the influence of the minor hills on this classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. &quot;Hors catégorie&quot; climbs awarded 40 points to the first rider across, down to 1 point for the 15th rider. First-category mountains awarded 30 points to the first rider to reach the top, with the other three categories awarding 20, 7, and 4 points respectively to the first man across the summit. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots. Luis Herrera won the mountains classification.

The combination jersey for the combination classification was introduced in this year&#x27;s Tour. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications: a first place in one of the classifications awarded 25 points, down to 1 point for 25th place. Only the general, mountains, points, and intermediate sprint classifications were included here. The winner of this classification was Greg LeMond.

Another classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey. The winner of this classification was Fabio Parra, who finished in eighth place in the general classification.

The sixth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only awarded points at intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey. The intermediate sprints awarded more points the more the Tour progressed, from 3, 2, and 1 points for the first three riders across during stages 1 to 5 to 12, 8, and 4 points respectively during the last five stages. The classification was won by Jozef Lieckens ().

For the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps. led both classifications after the prologue as well as from stage 8 until the finish.

In addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each mass-start stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Maarten Ducrot won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 17. This prize was won by Pello Ruiz Cabestany.

The 1985 Tour was the last to feature what was called &quot;flying stages&quot;, introduced in 1977: on stages 4 and 11, there was a finish line at the midway point of the course, which was treated as a stage finish but the race continued uninterrupted afterwards. Kim Andersen was the first to cross the line on stage 4, while Eric Vanderaerden took the honours on stage 11. They received the same prizes as regular stage winners, including prize money, time bonuses and points for the points classification, but the times were not taken for the general classification. Officially, they were also supposed to be counted as stage victories, but the public did not accept the concept and both are today not included in stage winner statistics. The idea was scrapped the following year.

In total, the Tour organisers paid out 3,003,050 French francs in prize money, with 40,000 and an apartment valued at 120,000 francs given to the winner of the general classification.

==Race overview==

===Opening stages===
Hinault laid down a claim towards his fifth Tour victory immediately by winning the prologue time trial. LeMond suffered mechanical issues, as a jammed chain slowed him in the final section of the course. He nevertheless finished fifth, 21 seconds behind Hinault. Eric Vanderaerden was second, four seconds slower than Hinault, ahead of Roche in third place. Alfons De Wolf () arrived five minutes late for his start and then lost another two minutes to Hinault, eliminating him from the race before reaching the first stage proper due to having missed the time limit.

Rudy Matthijs () won the first stage from a bunch sprint, ahead of Vanderaerden, who with the help of time bonuses took over the race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey. Maarten Ducrot () had gone on a solo breakaway and held a maximum lead of 16 minutes, but was caught with to go. Ángel Arroyo, who won second place in 1983, abandoned the race after just into the first stage. Matthijs made it two stage wins in a row on the second stage, this time coming out on top in a sprint ahead of Sean Kelly.

 won the stage 3 team time trial by over a minute ahead of the next-best team. Their team coach, Paul Köchli, had made the decision to fit faster wheels to the slower riders, balancing out the performance of the squad. While Vanderaerden held on to the yellow jersey courtesy of the time bonuses he had collected earlier, the eight riders behind him on general classification came from . Hinault, however, was bothered by the large amount of reporters and photographers behind the finish line, punching one of them on the chin. Stage 4 saw the first successful breakaway, with a seven-rider group finishing 46 seconds ahead of the main field. While Gerrit Solleveld () won the stage, Kim Andersen took the overall lead for . Future five-time Tour winner Miguel Induráin abandoned during stage 4.

Stage 5 into Roubaix, which featured some cobbled roads, was won by Henri Manders (). He had been in a breakaway with Teun van Vliet (), who had done most of the work on the front, before Manders left him about before the finish when van Vliet developed spasms in his legs. Stage 6 saw a controversial sprint finish in Reims. During the sprint, Kelly and Vanderaerden pushed against each other, forcing Kelly towards the barriers. Vanderaerden crossed the line first and received the stage honours and the yellow jersey on the podium. Later however, the race jury decided to relegate both Kelly and Vanderaerden to the back of their group in the stage results, giving the stage victory to Francis Castaing (), while Andersen kept the race lead. LeMond, who had mixed himself into the sprint, was raised from fourth to second, giving him a twenty-second time bonus. This allowed him to move into third place in the general classification, two seconds ahead of Hinault. With raced into stage 7, an eight-rider group attacked, including Ludwig Wijnants (), but were brought back later. Luis Herrera was active later in the stage, establishing a breakaway after . From this group, Wijnants, again in the breakaway, attacked with to go. Just as Herrera brought him back later, Wijnants attacked again to claim the stage win.

===Vosges and Jura===
Stage 8 saw the first long individual time trial of the Tour. At , it was the longest individual time trial in the Tour since 1960. Bernard Hinault won the stage by a high margin, with second-placed Roche 2:20 minutes slower. Hinault even caught and passed Sean Kelly, who had started two minutes ahead of him, and proceeded to gain another minute on him. Third was Mottet, ahead of LeMond, who lost 2:34 minutes to Hinault. While Hinault regained the race lead, LeMond was now his closest challenger, 2:32 minutes behind on the general classification, with Anderson and Roche already almost four minutes behind. Dietrich Thurau () was given a one-minute time penalty for drafting behind Mottet. Angry at the decision, Thurau physically attacked the judge who had handed out the penalty, grabbing him by the throat, and was subsequently ejected from the race on stage 10.

The next stage to Épinal was won by Maarten Ducrot, 38 seconds ahead of René Bittinger (). Jeronimo Ibañez Escribano () was taken to the hospital, following a crash from the finish. On stage 10, Jørgen V. Pedersen won the day for in a sprint finish, beating Johan Lammerts (). Hinault finished 15th and retained his lead in the overall standings. Paul Sherwen () was involved in a crash just into the stage and suffered throughout, reaching the finish more than an hour behind Pedersen. Since he arrived so late, he had to traverse in between spectators who thought no more riders would come across the route. He was well outside the time limit, but the race jury, against the advice of the race director, decided to allow him to start the next stage, naming his &quot;courage&quot; after his early fall as the reason for their decision.

===Alps===

The race entered the high mountains on stage 11 with the first leg in the Alps to Avoriaz. The route crossed the summits of the Pas de Morgins and Le Corbier before arriving in Morzine for the final ascent. Hinault strengthened his claim on the overall victory by escaping early with Luis Herrera, who by now was too far down in the general classification to be a threat. Instead, Herrera collected the points for the mountains classification, a lead which he would hold until the end of the race. Herrera also won the stage, seven seconds ahead of Hinault. LeMond lost 1:41, coming in fifth in a group with Delgado and Fabio Parra (). Hinault&#x27;s lead therefore increased to exactly four minutes on second-placed LeMond in the overall standings.

Even though stage 12 featured seven categorised climbs, it saw no changes on the top of the general classification, as Parra and Herrera fought out the victory between teammates. This time, it was Parra who emerged the winner, on the same time as Herrera. Kelly and Niki Rüttimann () followed 38 seconds down, one second ahead of the group containing the other favourites, led home by Roche. During the stage, Joël Pelier (), riding his first Tour, had followed Herrera, thinking he was joining a breakaway, not realising that Herrera was only sprinting for mountain points. Hinault, who was generally accepted as the &quot;patron&quot;, meaning the most influential rider, was unhappy with the acceleration in the field, as he wanted the tempo to remain slow. This led to an altercation between the two, with Hinault riding up to Pelier and to complain.

Weakened by his attacking riding style over the previous days, Hinault placed only second in the mountain time trial to Villard-de-Lans, about a minute behind Vanderaerden. Yet, his advantage over LeMond, who again had mechanical issues, increased to 5:23 minutes on the general classification. Roche lost 16 seconds to Hinault, Anderson 24 seconds and Kelly 35 seconds. Roche remained the closest competitor to the duo, sitting third overall, 6:08 minutes behind Hinault, with Kelly fourth, at 6:35 minutes. Anderson was sixth, behind Bauer.

===Transition through Massif Central===
Following the only rest day of the Tour, stage 14 took the riders to Saint-Étienne in the Massif Central. The stage, following a hilly route, saw Luis Herrera attack again and gain more points for the mountains classification. Although he crashed on the final descent of the day, he prevailed to reach the finish line first, soaked in blood, 47 seconds ahead of a small group of riders containing LeMond. Hinault followed in a group almost two minutes later. As they approached the finish, Bauer&#x27;s rear wheel hit a piece of traffic furniture. As his bike moved sideways, it touched Anderson&#x27;s, who crashed and brought down Hinault with him. The latter suffered a broken nose, but was able to finish the stage. As the accident had occurred within the final kilometre, the time he lost in the crash was not counted. However, Hinault rode the rest of the Tour with a stitched nose and two black eyes, caused by his sunglasses breaking when he fell. As a result of LeMond finishing ahead of him, Hinault&#x27;s overall lead was cut down to 3:32 minutes.

Stage 15 was another transition stage. Hennie Kuiper (), winner of Milan–San Remo earlier in the year, did not take the start. Pedro Muñoz abandoned the race after . Jean-Claude Bagot () escaped on the third climb of the day, after . After he was recaptured, another attack went, containing Joël Pelier. Hinault, suffering from his injuries, was unhappy with the accelerations and brought the escape group back himself, not least due to the participation of Pelier. After , Eduardo Chozas () attacked on a downhill section and managed to get away from the field. By the time he crossed the summit of the Col d&#x27;Entremont after , his lead had increased to over ten minutes. With left to ride, the gap had increased to over 11 minutes, while Ludo Peeters () escaped from the main field. At the finish, Chozas took victory, 9:51 minutes ahead of Peeters, who just held off the group of favourites, led by Kelly. Hinault retained the race lead, while Chozas rose to seventh overall.

Another stage with minor categorised climbs followed the next day. Frédéric Vichot () broke clear of the field after , building a maximum lead of more than twenty minutes. As he approached the finish, his advantage decreased significantly, but he won the stage, 3:12 minutes ahead of Mottet and Bontempi, as Hinault remained the leader of the race overall.

===Pyrenees===

Congestion in his broken nose had led to bronchitis for Hinault, severely impacting his ability to perform. He was therefore weakened as the race entered the Pyrenees on stage 17. On the Col du Tourmalet, set a high tempo, putting Hinault into difficulty. Pedro Delgado later recalled that he saw Hinault yelling at Herrera, at which point he decided to attack. With Delgado went Roche and LeMond, as well as Parra. Early leader Pello Ruiz Cabestany () led over the top of the Tourmalet, 1:18 minutes ahead of Delgado, followed by LeMond, Roche, and Parra two minutes down. 
As they approached the final ascent to Luz Ardiden, LeMond and Roche were in front. LeMond asked his team car about the gap to Hinault. Koechli told LeMond that Hinault was only 45 seconds behind him and that he was not allowed to work with Roche, in order not to endanger standing first and second on the general classification. He was told to hold station or attack and distance Roche. The latter heard the conversation between LeMond and his team car and remained alert, leading to both cancelling each other out and allowing other riders to catch back up. When LeMond saw that Hinault was not among them, he began to suspect that the gap he had been told was not correct. Delgado attacked from the main group and won the stage. LeMond eventually finished fifth, 2:52 minutes behind, and gained little over a minute on Hinault. At the finish, LeMond was visibly angry when interviewed by American television, saying that he felt betrayed by his team of a chance to win the Tour. In the general classification, Hinault remained in front, with LeMond 2:25 minutes behind. Views on the stage differ. LeMond describes how he was ready to quit the Tour that night, being severely disappointed by his team&#x27;s refusal to let him work with Roche in order to win the Tour. Hinault meanwhile maintains that there were no bad feelings inside during the 1985 Tour and that it was a clear case of not attacking a teammate who has the race lead. Later the same day, team owner Tapie and Hinault convinced LeMond to continue riding by assuring him that the year after, Hinault would work for LeMond. LeMond emerged from the meeting with a different public statement, telling the press that he got carried away after the finish and that he would continue to work for Hinault.

Stage 18a, which was held in the morning, had a summit finish on the Col d&#x27;Aubisque. Roche attacked on the final ascent and won the stage, taking one-and-a-half minutes out of Hinault&#x27;s lead. According to LeMond, Hinault was suffering so badly this time that LeMond had to push his teammate in order to conserve the race lead. Stage 18b in the afternoon was won by Roche&#x27;s teammate Régis Simon, who beat Álvaro Pino () in a two-man sprint to the finish line. After the two split stages, Hinault&#x27;s lead over LeMond stood at 2:13 minutes, with Roche in third, 3:30 minutes behind.

===Final stages===

With only one time trial to come, victory appeared all but secure for Hinault. Speaking to journalist Samuel Abt of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, five-time Tour winner Anquetil declared that he and Merckx would &quot;accept him in our club with pleasure&quot;. Stage 19 to Bordeaux remained uneventful until about to the finish, when several riders tried, but failed, to escape. The race then settled for a bunch sprint, won by Vanderaerden ahead of Kelly by a very small margin. It was the first time during this Tour that the entire field, still 145 riders strong, reached the finish together. The following day, Johan Lammerts achieved the third stage victory for the team. He had broken away with four other riders with to go and went clear of them from the finish to win by 21 seconds ahead of Andersen. LeMond gained several seconds through bonuses at intermediate sprints, closing the gap to Hinault to 1:59 minutes.

On the penultimate day of the Tour, stage 21 saw the final time trial, around Lac de Vassivière near Limoges. LeMond did not incur any mechanical difficulties this time and won the stage, five seconds faster than Hinault. It was not only the first stage win for LeMond, but the first for a rider from the United States. After the stage, LeMond said: &quot;Now I know I can beat Hinault. I know I can win the Tour de France.&quot; Third place went to Anderson, who finished 31 seconds slower than LeMond, with Kelly in fourth, 54 seconds adrift, five seconds faster than Roche.

The final stage into Paris was, per tradition, a ceremonial affair, with no attacks to alter the general classification. In the final sprint, Rudy Matthijs took his third stage victory, with Sean Kelly finishing in second place for the fifth time during this Tour. Hinault finished safely in the field to win his fifth Tour de France, putting him equal with Anquetil and Merckx as record winner of the event, as well as securing his second Giro-Tour double, winning both races in the same year. During the final stage, Pedro Delgado used the small categorised climbs along the route to move past Robert Millar into second place in the mountains classification, ensuring his team the prize money that went with it.

Hinault&#x27;s final victory margin over LeMond was 1:42 minutes. Roche rounded out the podium in third place, 4:29 minutes behind. His compatriot Kelly finished fourth overall, at 6:26 minutes, ahead of Anderson. Five teams finished the Tour with all ten riders still in the race: , , , , and .

==Aftermath==

Hinault reiterated his promise to work for LeMond the following year several times during the final part of the 1985 Tour. Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine &quot;Miroir du Cyclisme&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ll stir things up to help Greg win, and I&#x27;ll have fun doing it. That&#x27;s a promise.&quot; On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: &quot;Next year, it&#x27;s you&quot;, repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of that same evening. Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child&#x27;s scooter, with Hinault saying &quot;Because you&#x27;ve been so good, I&#x27;ll take you along next year on my handlebars&quot;, to which LeMond replied: &quot;Thanks, Uncle Bernard.&quot; LeMond&#x27;s first Tour victory the following year did not come as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the 1986 Tour de France, only conceding defeat after the last time trial. LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: &quot;He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.&quot; The rivalry between Hinault and LeMond in both the 1985 and 1986 Tours was subject of the documentary &quot;Slaying the Badger&quot;, part of ESPN&#x27;s series &quot;30 for 30&quot;. Based on the book by the same name by journalist Richard Moore, it premiered on 22 July 2014.

In previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault used clip-ins (clipless pedals), which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.

There was some criticism that the time trials were too important. If the time trials would have not counted towards the general classification, the result would have been as follows:

The total length of the time trials reduced from in 1985 to in 1986. Tour director Félix Lévitan felt after the 1985 Tour de France that the race had been too easy and made the course in 1986 extra difficult, including more mountain climbs than before.

This was the last year that the Tour de France was actively managed by Jacques Goddet, who had taken over as race director from the race&#x27;s founder, Henri Desgrange, in 1936.

==Doping==
After every stage, around four cyclists were selected for doping controls. None of these cyclists tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. After the end of the Tour, world champion Claude Criquielion, who had finished 18th overall, was involved in a doping controversy. At the national championship race before the Tour, he had tested positive for Pervitin, but received no repercussions. The head of the laboratory at Ghent University, which had administered the analysis, subsequently resigned his post in the Medical Commission of the Belgian Cycling Association (KBWB) in protest.

<text>Timothy Simon Spicer, (born 1952) is a former British Army officer, and former CEO of the private security company Aegis Defence Services. He served in the Falklands War and in Northern Ireland. He founded Sandline International, a private military company which closed in April 2004. He is the author of three books: &quot;An Unorthodox Soldier: Peace and War and the Sandline Affair&quot; (2000), &quot;A Dangerous Enterprise: Secret War at Sea&quot; (2021) and &quot;A Suspicion of Spies: Risk, Secrets and Shadows - the Biography of Wilfred ‘Biffy’ Dunderdale&quot; will be published on 12 September 2024.

==Early life and military career==
Born in 1952 in Aldershot, England, Spicer was educated at Sherborne School and followed his father into the British Army, attending Sandhurst and then enlisted in the Scots Guards. He tried to join the Special Air Service (SAS) prior to joining the Scots Guards, but failed the entry course. In 1982, his regiment was pulled from guard duty at the Tower of London and sent to the Falklands War, where he saw action at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown on 13 June.

After the Falklands War, Spicer, then at the rank of lieutenant colonel, was sent to Northern Ireland along with his regiment as part of Operation Banner during the Troubles. In 1992, Spicer was awarded the OBE &quot;for operational service in Northern Ireland&quot;. On 4 September of that year, two soldiers under his command, Mark Wright and James Fisher, shot and killed an 18-year old Catholic teenager named Peter McBride in disputed circumstances. Immediately following the incident, Wright and Fisher were interviewed by Spicer and three other officers before they were interrogated by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In his 1999 autobiography &quot;An Unorthodox Soldier&quot;, Spicer wrote that &quot;I thought between us we could reach a balanced judgement on what happened.&quot; 

The two soldiers were subsequently tried via court-martial, which convicted them of murder and sentenced the pair to life imprisonment at HM Prison Maghaberry on 10 February 1995. At the court-martial, Wright and James claimed that they feared that McBride was about to throw an improvised explosive device he had hidden in a plastic bag towards them, a claim which Spicer supported (the bag was subsequently found to only contain a t-shirt). 

In reaction to their conviction, Spicer organised a lobbying campaign to free Wright and James, arguing that the two had legitimately believed that their lives were in imminent danger due to McBride&#x27;s actions. The campaign successfully persuaded the British government to free the pair from HM Prison Maghaberry on 2 September 1998, after they had spent roughly three and a half years in prison. Wright and James were flown to Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire to meet Spicer, where they stayed until the Army Board decided to reinstate them into the Scots Guards a month later; the pair subsequently served in the Iraq War.

==Private military company==
In 1994 he left the army and founded Sandline International, a private military company. 

===Sandline affair===

The Sandline affair was a political scandal that became one of the defining moments in the history of Papua New Guinea (PNG), and particularly that of the conflict in Bougainville. It brought down the PNG government of Sir Julius Chan and took Papua New Guinea to the verge of military revolt. After coming to power in 1994, Prime Minister Chan made repeated attempts to resolve the Bougainville conflict by diplomatic means. These were ultimately unsuccessful, due to the repeated failure of Bougainvillean leaders to arrive at scheduled peace talks. 

After a number of failed military assaults and the refusal of Australia and New Zealand to provide troops, a decision was then made to investigate the use of mercenaries. Through some overseas contacts, defence minister Mathias Ijape was put in contact with Spicer. He accepted a contract for $36 million, but the deal fell through when the PNG Army found out that so much money was being spent on a job they claimed to be able to do. The Army overthrew the PNG government and arrested Spicer. He was eventually released and sued the PNG government for money not paid.

===Sierra Leone Scandal: the arms-to-Africa affair===
When employed by Sandline International, Spicer was involved in military operations in the Sierra Leone Civil War, which included importing weapons in apparent violation of the United Nations arms embargo. The contract was first offered to Globe Risk International who declined the contract on moral grounds. He had been contacted by Rakesh Saxena, an Indian financier hoping that a new government would grant him diamond and mineral concessions. The controversy over this incident, and whether the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) knew of Sandline&#x27;s actions; inquiries into it concluded that the FCO had known of the actions, and that Spicer believed he was not breaking the embargo. However, former British diplomat Craig Murray claims that he was present at a Foreign office meeting when Spicer was explicitly read the text of UN Security Council Resolution 1132 which obliges member states to prevent their nationals from importing arms to Sierra Leone.

Spicer maintains neither he nor Sandline did anything illegal: 

Spicer has claimed that he always has called for greater involvement of the British government in the PMC issue. In fact, Lt. Col. Spicer said that six weeks before the arms-to-Africa affair blew up, Sandline had submitted a paper to the Foreign Office calling for greater regulation, but had not yet received a response. At the time, with no government response, Sandline was considering setting up its own oversight committee, including a senior retired general, a lawyer and a representative of the media.

In late 1999, Spicer left Sandline, which kept operating until 2004. The next year, he launched Crisis and Risk Management. In 2001, he changed the company&#x27;s name to Strategic Consulting International and also set up a partner firm specialising in anti-piracy consulting, called Trident Maritime. In 2002, Spicer established Aegis Defence Services, which around the beginning of the Iraq War was consulting for the Disney Cruise Line.

===Aegis Defence Services===
Spicer was Chief Executive of Aegis Defence Services, a PMC based in London, until replaced by Major General Graham Binns in 2010. The chairman of the Aegis board of directors is former Defence minister, Nicholas Soames MP. The Board of Directors include: General Sir Roger Wheeler, Chief of the General Staff; Paul Boateng, former Labour Minister and ex-High Commissioner to South Africa and Sir John Birch, former British deputy ambassador to the United Nations.

In October 2004, Aegis won a $293 million three-year contract in Iraq outsourcing, among other things, intelligence for the U.S. Army.

===Criticism by US Senators===
In 2005, following the award of this contract, five United States Senators – Charles Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Chris Dodd and John Kerry – wrote a joint letter calling on Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld to investigate the granting of the Aegis contract, describing Spicer as &quot;an individual with a history of supporting excessive use of force against a civilian population&quot; and stating that he &quot;vigorously defends [human rights abuses]&quot;.

In a December 2005 letter to his constituents, then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) called on the Department of Defense to withdraw its contract with Aegis. Obama wrote that &quot;The CEO of Aegis Defense Services Tim Spicer has been implicated in a variety of human rights abuses around the globe ... given his history, I agree that the United States should consider rescinding its contract with his company.&quot;

<text>LO, The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (Danish: &quot;LO, Landsorganisationen i Danmark&quot; or simply &quot;LO&quot;) was founded in 1898 and was an umbrella organisation (the largest of the three national trade union centers in Denmark) for 18 Danish trade unions. At the end of 2018, it merged into the new Danish Trade Union Confederation.

==History==
Lizette Risgaard, who became the first ever female President for LO-Denmark in October 2015, had worked her way slowly up the ladder and was for eight years the vice president.

From 2015, LO engaged in negotiations with FTF about a potential merger. This occurred on 1 January 2019, and the LO became part of the new Danish Trade Union Confederation.

==Organisation==
In 2016, LO had a membership of about 1.1 million workers (450,000 of them being public sector employees and 650,000 of them being private sector employees). It cooperated with the two other Danish trade union centers: the AC – The Danish Confederation of Professional Associations and the FTF – Confederation of Professionals in Denmark.

Members of the 18 trade unions of the LO were typically skilled or unskilled manual labourers, tradesmen and blue-collar workers from the working class. Members may have had a vocational education, but not a college or academic degree. A typical LO-member occupied a lower class position in society and earned an hourly wage.

LO-members were e.g. blue-collar workers, cleaners, bus drivers, plumbers, electricians, nursing assistants, hairdressers, painters, cosmeticians, gardeners, iron workers, dairymen, secretaries, technicians, assistants, etc.

The LO was affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC) and the Council of Nordic Trade Unions (NFS).

The LO carried the role of coordinating collective bargaining. It also sought to influence the government and the political parties when it comes to drafting and implementing legislation, especially in relation to labour market policies. It represented the trade union movement&#x27;s interests on various boards, commissions and committees.

<doc id="1062701" wikidata="Q7889816" url="?curid=1062701" title="United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina">
<text>The United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina (in case citations, M.D.N.C.) is a United States district court with jurisdiction over 24 counties in the center of North Carolina. It consists of five divisions with a headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Appeals from the Middle District of North Carolina are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

==Jurisdiction==
The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina has jurisdiction over 24 counties: Alamance, Cabarrus, Caswell, Chatham, Davidson, Davie, Durham (excluding that portion of Durham County encompassing the Federal Correctional Institution, Butner, North Carolina), Forsyth, Guilford, Hoke, Lee, Montgomery, Moore, Orange, Person, Randolph, Richmond, Rockingham, Rowan, Scotland, Stanly, Stokes, Surry, and Yadkin.

The district&#x27;s jurisdiction was modified in 2021 to transfer the portions of four counties (Hoke, Moore, Richmond, and Scotland) containing Fort Bragg Military Reservation and Camp Mackall to the Eastern District of North Carolina.

==History==
The United States District Court for the District of North Carolina was established on June 4, 1790, by 1 Stat. 126. On June 9, 1794 it was subdivided into three districts by 1 Stat. 395, but on March 3, 1797, the three districts were abolished and the single District restored by 1 Stat. 517, until April 29, 1802, when the state was again subdivided into three different districts by 2 Stat. 156.

In both instances, these districts, unlike those with geographic designations that existed in other states, were titled by the names of the cities in which the courts sat. After the first division, they were styled the District of Edenton, the District of New Bern, and the District of Wilmington; after the second division, they were styled the District of Albemarle, the District of Cape Fear, and the District of Pamptico. However, in both instances, only one judge was authorized to serve all three districts, causing them to effectively operate as a single district. The latter combination was occasionally referred to by the cumbersome title of the United States District Court for the Albemarle, Cape Fear &amp; Pamptico Districts of North Carolina.

On June 4, 1872, North Carolina was re-divided into two Districts, Eastern and Western, by 17 Stat. 215. The Middle District was created from portions of the Eastern and Western Districts on March 2, 1927, by 44 Stat. 1339. Shortly thereafter, President Calvin Coolidge appointed Johnson Jay Hayes by recess appointment to be the first judge of the Middle District of North Carolina.

<text>WBIN (640 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Atlanta, Georgia. It is owned by iHeartMedia, through its subsidiary iHM Licenses, LLC. It serves the Atlanta metropolitan area as its affiliate for the Black Information Network. The station&#x27;s studios and offices located at the Peachtree Palisades Building in the Brookwood Hills district. The transmitter site is off Joseph E. Boone Boulevard Northwest in the Center Hill neighborhood of Atlanta.

==History==
The station signed on April 7, 1988, as WPBD, programming R&amp;B oldies and soul. The original owner was the Phoenix City Broadcasting company, headed by Michael Hollins, under a Federal Communications Commission program promoting minority ownership. However, after it signed on, Hollins immediately began making arrangements to sell the station. A proposed purchase by Jefferson-Pilot Communications, owners of WQXI and WQXI-FM, fell through. However, in October 1988, it was announced that Jacor Communications, Inc. would buy the station.

At this time, Jacor was operating a station on with the call letters WGST (now WGKA). However, WPBD had a better signal than WGST. It operated at 50,000 watts during the daytime and 1,000 watts at night, a substantial increase in daytime power and signal coverage area compared to WGST&#x27;s facilities. Effective June 30, 1989, WPBD&#x27;s call sign was changed to WGST. The talk radio programming previously on was transferred to . Among WGST&#x27;s staff of talk hosts was Neal Boortz.

In 1992, Boortz asked WGST management for a raise but he was turned down. Talk radio rival WSB hired Boortz, WGST then hired Sean Hannity to replace Boortz, after a few other hosts were tried out in his time slot. Hannity was brought in from a Huntsville, Alabama, radio station where he previously worked. He stayed at WGST until Roger Ailes offered Hannity a position on the soon-to-debut Fox News Channel in 1996. During his time at WGST, he was given the nickname &quot;Hanni-Pie, The Tin Man&quot; by fellow host Kim Peterson.

WGST was also the home for Atlanta Braves baseball broadcasts, from 1992-1994. WGST was the station that carried Sid Bream&#x27;s winning slide in Game Seven of the 1992 NLCS. In May 1994, the station was outbid for Braves broadcast rights by WSB, which previously had carried the games from 1966 until 1991. WGST was also the home of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team until 1995, after which the Hawks followed the Braves to WSB. WGST carried NASCAR races in 1996 and 1997. It was the home of Atlanta Falcons football in 1998 when the team made its first Super Bowl appearance.

From 1993 until 2000, WGST programming was simulcast on WGST-FM (now WBZY). In 1999, Clear Channel Communications bought out Jacor, including WGST. Clear Channel was the forerunner to iHeartMedia, the present-day owner of the station.

2005 marked a year of change for WGST. The station won the rights to once again carry Atlanta Braves baseball. The station changed its moniker to &quot;Braves Radio 640 GST.&quot; Many Braves fans who lived outside Atlanta and its close-in suburbs complained about the change from WSB, noting WGST&#x27;s signal was much weaker at night than that of WSB&#x27;s 50,000 watt clear channel broadcasts. To remedy the situation, WGST’s sister station WKLS (96.1 FM, now WWPW) began simulcasting Braves games. WKLS was powered at 100,000 watts, covering Atlanta and its growing suburbs.

Since the 1950s, WGST had been an ABC Radio Network affiliate. In 2005, as part of a Clear Channel corporate change, WGST switched to Fox News Radio as its national news provider. No longer affiliated with ABC, in March 2005, WGST dropped Paul Harvey&#x27;s syndicated ABC news commentaries from its line-up.

On March 20, 2006, WGST&#x27;s moniker became &quot;Atlanta. Talk. Radio.&quot; On November 21, 2006, WGST announced that morning drive time host Tom Hughes had resigned, and that midday host Denny Schaffer, and afternoon drive talk host Kim Peterson (&quot;The Kimmer&quot;) and their staffs had been fired. On February 5, 2007, WGST announced that veteran Atlanta morning show hosts Randy Cook and Spiff Carner would be joining the station for a new live and local morning show.

On September 27, 2007, the syndicated Glenn Beck Program returned to WGST in the 9 a.m. to noon slot. Beck was previously heard on WGST from 2001 to 2005. Beck took over Mike McConnell&#x27;s weekday spot, though McConnell was still heard on weekends.

On October 9, 2007, morning co-host Spiff Carner was fired by WGST, after 8 months on the air. Randy Cook remained on the newly named &quot;The Morning Drive with Randy Cook.&quot; Spiff was later hired to co-host the &quot;Spiff and Fred&quot; show on WYAY. Clear Channel management did not renew Randy Cook&#x27;s contract in July 2009. &quot;The Morning Drive&quot; was briefly hosted by comedian Mike Stiles from July 13 to 24, 2009, before being replaced by syndicated shows.

From July 27, 2009, to November 12, 2010, the weekday lineup consisted of all syndicated programming: &quot;The Wall Street Journal This Morning&quot; and Michael Smerconish in mornings; Glenn Beck in late mornings; The Rush Limbaugh Show in middays; Dave Ramsey in afternoons; Mark Levin in evenings and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; with George Noory overnights. Atlanta Braves broadcasts would be dropped by WGST at the end of the 2009 baseball season.
On November 15, 2010, Atlanta radio personality Rob Johnson became the new morning host. On January 11, 2011, WGST said it would pick up &quot;The Savage Nation&quot;, a syndicated show from San Francisco hosted by Michael Savage. That was one day after it was cut by WSB in a schedule change. Beginning in early 2012, Atlanta local Dave Merlino joined Rob Johnson&#x27;s morning show, re-billed as &quot;The Rob and Dave Show&quot;. The weekday lineup was &quot;The Rob &amp; Dave Show&quot; at 6 a.m., Glenn Beck at 9 a.m., Rush Limbaugh at noon, a local version of &quot;The Rusty Humphries Show&quot; at 3 p.m., Mark Levin at 6 p.m., Michael Savage at 9 p.m., George Noory at midnight and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; report at 5 a.m.

On September 26, 2012, several Atlanta news outlets reported that WGST would be changing formats. Johnson, Merlino, and Humphries were terminated, Limbaugh&#x27;s show switched to WSB and Glenn Beck&#x27;s show was picked up by WCFO. Coincidentally, Michael Savage suspended the broadcast of his show around the same time due to a contract dispute with his syndicator. On September 28, 2012, at 3 p.m., following Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s program, WGST switched to a Spanish-language sports radio format, carrying the syndicated ESPN Deportes Radio Network.

On April 23, 2013, less than eight months after switching to Spanish-language sports, WGST announced it would return to an English-language talk format beginning June 3, 2013, featuring a lineup consisting entirely of syndicated programs, including &quot;Bloomberg&#x27;s First Word with Ken Prewitt&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s First News with Gordon Deal&quot;, Glenn Beck, Michael Berry, and &quot;Coast to Coast AM among others.&quot; ESPN Deportes Radio moved to the FM translator 92.3 W222AF, replacing an all-comedy format.

In the early 2010s, WGST was simulcast on an HD Radio digital subchannel of sister station WUBL FM 94.9, along with FM translator station W222AF. WGST was also carried on the audio-only digital subchannel 32.21 of low-powered digital television station WANN-CD, as Clear Channel&#x27;s other Atlanta holdings were. When WGST switched to Spanish-language sports, these three stations aired &quot;Comedy 92-3.&quot; WUBL HD-3 and WANN-CA returned to running WGST after ESPN Deportes was dropped.

On August 30, 2019, WGST flipped to conservative talk as &quot;640 Fox News Radio&quot; with a revised lineup. On June 29, 2020, the station began stunting with speeches by prominent African Americans. The next day, WGST flipped to all-news radio as &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s BIN 640&quot;; it is one of the charter stations of iHeartMedia&#x27;s Black Information Network — a multi-platform radio network serving the African-American community. On July 6, the station changed its call sign to WBIN to match the new branding.

<doc id="1062713" wikidata="Q560040" url="?curid=1062713" title="Rick Davies">
<text>Richard Davies (born 22 July 1944) is an English musician, singer and songwriter best known as founder, vocalist and keyboardist of the rock band Supertramp. Davies was its only constant member, and composed some of the band&#x27;s best-known songs, including &quot;Rudy&quot;, &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody But Me&quot;, &quot;From Now On&quot;, &quot;Gone Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, &quot;Just Another Nervous Wreck&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Lady&quot;, &quot;Cannonball&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Beggin&#x27; You&quot;. He is generally noted for his rhythmic blues piano solos and jazz-tinged progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics.

Starting with the self-titled &quot;Supertramp&quot; in 1970, Davies shared lead vocals with Supertramp songwriting partner Roger Hodgson until the latter&#x27;s departure in 1983, at which point he became the sole lead vocalist of the group. Davies&#x27;s voice is deeper than Hodgson&#x27;s, and he usually employs a raspy baritone which stands in stark contrast to his bandmate&#x27;s tenor. However, he occasionally sings in a falsetto which superficially resembles Hodgson&#x27;s vocals, such as on &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; and &quot;My Kind of Lady&quot;.

==Biography and career==
===Early life===
Richard Davies was born in Swindon, Wiltshire in 1944 to Betty and Dick Davies. Betty was a hairdresser and ran a salon, and Dick was a merchant navy man, who died in 1973. Rick went to Sanford Street School and, according to mother Betty: &quot;Music was the only thing he was any good at at school.&quot;

His first musical stirrings were at the age of eight, when his parents gave him a secondhand radiogram which included a few records left by the previous owner. Among them were &quot;Drummin&#x27; Man&quot; by drumming legend Gene Krupa, and, in Davies&#x27;s own words, &quot;it hit like a thunderbolt&quot;. &quot;I must have played it 2,000 times,&quot; he said. &quot;That was it.&quot; A friend of the family made Rick a makeshift drum kit out of a biscuit tin, and at the age of 12 he joined the British Railways Staff Association Brass and Silver Jubilee Band as a snare drummer. In an interview in 2002 he said: &quot;As a kid, I used to hear the drums marching along the street in England, in my home town, when there was some kind of parade, and it was the most fantastic sound to me. Then, eventually, I got some drums and I took lessons. I was serious about it... I figured if I could do that – I mean a real drummer, read music and play with big bands, rock bands, classical, Latin, and know what I was going to do – I would be in demand and my life was set... Eventually, I started fiddling with the keyboards, and that seemed to go over better than my drumming, for some reason. So you&#x27;ve gotta go with what people react to.&quot; He never had lessons for keyboards, but, according to Betty Davies, &quot;taught himself most of what he knows about music&quot;.

By 1959, his attention had been captured by rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and he joined a band called Vince and the Vigilantes. In 1962, while studying in the art department at Swindon College, he formed his own band, called Rick&#x27;s Blues, and was now playing a Hohner electric piano instead of drums. The band included Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan on drums for a time; he later was the best man at Davies&#x27;s wedding. In a March 1972 interview, O&#x27;Sullivan said &quot;Rick had originally taught me how to play the drums and piano – in fact, he taught me everything about music.&quot; When his father became ill, Davies disbanded Rick&#x27;s Blues, left college, and took a job as a welder at Square D, a firm making industrial control products and systems, which had a factory on the Cheney Manor Trading Estate in Swindon. Any hopes of an artistic career were temporarily put on ice.

In 1966 he became the organist for The Lonely Ones (best known for being one of Noel Redding&#x27;s first bands, though Redding had left by the time Davies joined), who later changed their name to The Joint and recorded the soundtracks for a number of German films. He later confessed that he lied about his abilities to get into the group, admitting he could not actually play the organ at the time. While the band was in Munich, Davies met Dutch millionaire Stanley August Miesegaes, who offered to fund him if he started a new group.

===Supertramp===

Davies decided to form a new band, and returned home from Switzerland to place an ad in the music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in August 1969. Roger Hodgson was auditioned and, despite their contrasting backgrounds – Davies&#x27;s working class upbringing and Hodgson&#x27;s private school education – they struck up an instant rapport and began writing virtually all of their songs together. The band was initially called Daddy, but renamed Supertramp in January 1970.

Supertramp became one of the first acts to sign to the emerging UK branch of A&amp;M Records and by the summer of 1970 they had recorded their first album, simply called &quot;Supertramp&quot;. Hodgson performed most of the lead vocals on this first effort but by the time of their second album &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot;, Davies had stepped up as a singer with he and Hodgson sharing lead vocal duties equally.

After five years with Davies and Hodgson as the mainstays of a continuously changing group, Supertramp settled into a stable lineup and recorded &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, which finally brought them critical and commercial success when it was released in 1974. It reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. Though their singles were only moderately successful, their albums consistently scored high in the charts. Davies&#x27;s relationship with Hodgson was changing and the two began writing most of their songs separately again, though they agreed to have them all credited to Davies/Hodgson by contract. Among the songs credited to both but actually written solely by Davies are the hits &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;.

The group had relocated to the United States by 1977 and it was there that they recorded their best-selling album, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; from April 1978 to February 1979. Davies and Hodgson were observed by engineer Peter Henderson to be getting along &quot;fantastically well and everyone was really happy&quot; throughout the long months of recording and mixing. Davies is credited with writing the answering lyric in the second chorus of Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;The Logical Song&quot;. With more hit singles than their first five albums combined, the album reached number three in the UK, and top of the charts in America.

Hodgson quit Supertramp in 1983. Davies&#x27; relationship with him had deteriorated and the group&#x27;s last hit before his departure, &quot;My Kind of Lady&quot;, featured little involvement from Hodgson as either a writer or performer. The song was a showcase for Davies&#x27;s vocal range, with him singing in everything from a booming bass to a piercing falsetto to his natural raspy baritone. With Davies firmly at the helm, Supertramp returned to a more non-commercial, progressive rock-oriented sound with the album &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; and had another hit with &quot;Cannonball&quot;. The band continued to tour and record for another five years before disbanding, with a mutual agreement between the members that Supertramp had run its course.

In 1997, during work on what would have been his first solo album, Davies decided to reform Supertramp. The band promptly returned to recording and touring, which yielded another two studio albums before they split again. Supertramp reunited in 2010 for their 70–10 tour. A 2015 tour was announced but ultimately cancelled due to Davies&#x27; health issues as he was battling multiple myeloma.

In late August 2018, Rick Davies gave a rare interview in which he expressed that, for the most part, he has overcome his health problems and enjoys playing music again, something he could not do around 2016, when he was under medical treatment. Davies later performed a few tracks as Ricky and the Rockets in a rehearsal/sound check at a bar, along with Supertramp&#x27;s current members. However, he also stated that it was unlikely that they would ever perform again as Supertramp. Ricky and the Rockets performed another show on 10 June 2022 at the Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett, New York.

==Personal life==
Davies married Sue (who has been Supertramp&#x27;s manager since 1984) in 1977.

Davies&#x27; mother died in late 2008 at a nursing home in Stratton St Margaret. He travelled from his Long Island, New York, home every Christmas to visit her. His last trip back was in January 2009 to organise a memorial service for his mother.

Davies currently owns Rick Davies Productions which is the copyright holder of Supertramp&#x27;s recordings.

Davies was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and cancelled the band&#x27;s 2015 tour.

<text>Charleston Lake Provincial Park is located on Charleston Lake near Athens, Ontario, Canada, in the township of Leeds and the Thousand Islands.

The park occupies in the Frontenac Axis region, a southern extension of the Canadian Shield. The park&#x27;s forests and animal life, therefore, include species normally found further north, yet the southern climate allows species more typical for the southern latitude to co-exist with the northern species. The park includes hiking trails, swimming areas and campgrounds.

There are four yurts located in the Shady Ridge Campground; these yurts are not heated and do not have electricity. There is also a rustic cabin which is accessible by water and has lights and a small fridge which are solar-powered.

The lake includes a number of islands and has an irregular shoreline which makes it an interesting location for canoeing and kayaking. Blue Mountain, elevation , is also within the park. The summit was the highest point of the former Leeds County, Ontario. The trail to Blue Mountain has two access points, by water from Huckleberry Hollow, and by land from the intersection of Warburton and Blue Mountain Roads.

Blue Mountain can be reached via Blue Mountain Road from Highway #2. Hikers have permission to cross private land and a well-marked trail leads to the summit with a panoramic 360° view. The trek requires approximately 2 to 2.5 hours on foot or 1.5 hours on bike, although cyclists must carry their bikes in many places where hard granite jets out of the earth below which forms the mountain. A compass may be useful for inexperienced hikers.

This area was the site of a re-introduction program for the peregrine falcon. The park also provides habitat for the rare and harmless black rat snake, which is the largest snake found in Canada.

<doc id="1062753" wikidata="Q560823" url="?curid=1062753" title="Louis Bachelier">
<text>Louis Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Bachelier (; 11 March 1870 – 28 April 1946) was a French mathematician at the turn of the 20th century. He is credited with being the first person to model the stochastic process now called Brownian motion, as part of his doctoral thesis &quot;The Theory of Speculation&quot; (&quot;Théorie de la spéculation&quot;, defended in 1900).

Bachelier&#x27;s doctoral thesis, which introduced the first mathematical model of Brownian motion and its use for valuing stock options, was the first paper to use advanced mathematics in the study of finance. His Bachelier model has been influential in the development of other widely used models, including the Black-Scholes model. 

Bachelier is considered as the forefather of mathematical finance and a pioneer in the study of stochastic processes.

== Early years ==

Bachelier was born in Le Havre, in Seine-Maritime. His father was a wine merchant and amateur scientist, and the vice-consul of Venezuela at Le Havre. His mother was the daughter of an important banker (who was also a writer of poetry books). Both of Louis&#x27;s parents died just after he completed his high school diploma (&quot;baccalauréat&quot; in French), forcing him to take care of his sister and three-year-old brother and to assume the family business, which effectively put his graduate studies on hold. During this time Bachelier gained a practical acquaintance with the financial markets. His studies were further delayed by military service. Bachelier arrived in Paris in 1892 to study at the Sorbonne, where his grades were less than ideal.

== The doctoral thesis ==

Defended on 29 March 1900 at the University of Paris, Bachelier&#x27;s thesis was not well received because it attempted to apply mathematics to an area mathematicians found unfamiliar. However, his instructor, Henri Poincaré, is recorded as having given some positive feedback (though insufficient to secure Bachelier an immediate teaching position in France at that time). For example, Poincaré called his approach to deriving Gauss&#x27;s law of errors


The thesis received a grade of &quot;honorable,&quot; and was accepted for publication in the prestigious &quot;Annales Scientifiques de l’École Normale Supérieure&quot;. While it did not receive a mark of &quot;très honorable&quot;, despite its ultimate importance, the grade assigned is still interpreted as an appreciation for his contribution. Jean-Michel Courtault et al. point out in &quot;On the Centenary of &quot;Théorie de la spéculation&quot;&quot; that &quot;honorable&quot; was &quot;the highest note which could be awarded for a thesis that was essentially outside mathematics and that had a number of arguments far from being rigorous&quot;.

== Academic career ==

For several years following the successful defense of his thesis, Bachelier further developed the theory of diffusion processes, and was published in prestigious journals. In 1909 he became a &quot;free professor&quot; at the Sorbonne. In 1914, he published a book, &quot;Le Jeu, la Chance, et le Hasard&quot; (Games, Chance, and Randomness), that sold over six thousand copies. With the support of the Council of the University of Paris, Bachelier was given a permanent professorship at the Sorbonne, but World War I intervened and he was drafted into the French army as a private. His army service ended on December 31, 1918. In 1919, he found a position as an assistant professor in Besançon, replacing a regular professor on leave. He married Augustine Jeanne Maillot in September 1920 but was soon widowed. When the professor returned in 1922, Bachelier replaced another professor at Dijon. He moved to Rennes in 1925, but was finally awarded a permanent professorship in 1927 at the University of Besançon, where he worked for 10 years until his retirement.

Besides the setback that the war had caused him, Bachelier was blackballed in 1926 when he attempted to receive a permanent position at Dijon. This was due to a &quot;misinterpretation&quot; of one of Bachelier&#x27;s papers by Professor Paul Lévy, who—to Bachelier&#x27;s understandable fury—knew nothing of Bachelier&#x27;s work, nor of the candidate that Lévy recommended above him. Lévy later learned of his error, and reconciled himself with Bachelier.

Although Bachelier&#x27;s work on random walks predated Einstein&#x27;s celebrated study of Brownian motion by five years, the pioneering nature of his work was recognized only after several decades, first by Andrey Kolmogorov who pointed out his work to Paul Lévy, then by Leonard Jimmie Savage who translated Bachelier&#x27;s thesis into English and brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. The arguments Bachelier used in his thesis also predate Eugene Fama&#x27;s efficient-market hypothesis, which is very closely related, as the idea of a random walk is suited to predict the random future in a stock market where everyone has all the available information. His work in finance is recognized as one of the foundations for the Black–Scholes model.

<text>Allan Beekman (January 16, 1913 – October 29, 2001) was an American reporter and author who wrote &quot;The Niihau Incident&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian Tales&quot;.

==Life==
Born in Utica, New York, Beekman moved to Hawaii as a young man in the early 1930s and lived there the remainder of his life. Severe deafness, which began at the age of 16, and the Great Depression kept him from going to college as a young man. He became fluent in the Japanese language, enabling him to write about the Japanese experience from Japanese language sources not available in English. He also became a scholar in Japanese immigrant history.

He was a reporter for the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; and later wrote features and a weekly book review for more than 20 years at &quot;Pacific Citizen,&quot; a weekly newspaper directed to Americans of Japanese descent. Beekman championed the rights of Japanese Americans with articles and letters to the editor of Honolulu dailies, along with local political commentaries.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Beekman also worked as a security guard at Queen&#x27;s Medical Center.

Beekman married Take Okawa, a former Japanese-language schoolteacher educated in Tokyo and Hawaii, who collaborated with her husband on several Japanese immigrant stories.

He died in Honolulu, Hawaii on October 29, 2001.

==Works==
Several of the stories in &quot;Hawaiian Tales,&quot; published in 1972, dealt with pre-, post-, and wartime experiences of Japanese immigrants.

&quot;The Niihau Incident&quot; was a nonfiction account of the crash-landing of a Japanese Zero on the Hawaiian island of Niihau immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Beekman was the first to uncover some important details, until then unavailable in English, of the story of the Japanese fighter pilot, Shigenori Nishikaichi. Nishikaichi, unable to return to his carrier after the attack, crashed on the American island of Niihau and terrorized its residents for seven days. During this time the U.S. government was completely unaware of his presence there. After many years of original and in-depth research, Beekman grew to be the world authority on this incident.

<text>Turn On the Bright Lights is the debut studio album by American rock band Interpol. It was released in the United Kingdom on August 19, 2002, and in the United States the following day, through independent record label Matador Records. The album was recorded in November 2001 at Tarquin Studios in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and was co-produced, mixed and engineered by Peter Katis and Gareth Jones. Its title is taken from a repeated line in the song &quot;NYC&quot;.

Upon release, the record peaked at number 101 on the UK Albums Chart. It reached number 158 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, as well as spending 73 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart, peaking at number five. The songs &quot;PDA&quot;, &quot;Obstacle 1&quot; and the double a-side single &quot;Say Hello to the Angels&quot; / &quot;NYC&quot; were released as singles, with music videos being shot for all except &quot;Say Hello to the Angels&quot;.

==Music==

In a brief interview about the fifteenth anniversary of &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot;, Interpol guitarist Daniel Kessler stated the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Untitled&quot; was written specifically to open the band&#x27;s live shows. Lead singer Paul Banks described the riff from the song as &quot;signature Daniel&quot;.

==Promotion and release==
The release of &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; was preceded by the marketing of the band&#x27;s self-titled EP &quot;Interpol&quot; in June 2002, their first release for Matador. The EP contained three tracks: radio single &quot;PDA&quot;, future single &quot;NYC&quot;, and &quot;Specialist&quot;. All three tracks later appeared on the album, with &quot;Specialist&quot; included as a bonus track in Australian and Japanese editions. Further promotion continued at the beginning of the following year, when the band played the 2003 &quot;NME&quot; Awards Tour alongside the Datsuns, the Polyphonic Spree and the Thrills. The song &quot;PDA&quot; is featured as a playable track in 2008 video game &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;.

===10th anniversary edition===
In 2012 a remastered version of the album was released in order to commemorate its tenth anniversary. It featured additional material including demo recordings of several tracks, the bonus songs previously available on international releases and a DVD of live performances and music videos. Many of the demo recording tracks had been previously released however the 10th Anniversary Edition also contains five unreleased demo tracks from what is dubbed &quot;Third Demo&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; was released to critical acclaim. The album holds a score of 81 out of 100 from the aggregate site Metacritic based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Contemporary reviews of the album often noted Interpol&#x27;s influences and drew comparisons to several other acts. Michael Chamy of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; cited &quot;melodic Peter Hook-like basslines; the divine shoegazer textures of My Bloody Valentine and Ride; a peppy, Strokes-like bounce; and a singer who&#x27;s a dead ringer for Ian Curtis.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s almost as if Ian Curtis never hanged himself,&quot; began &quot;Blender&quot;″s review, with critic Jonah Weiner adding that Paul Banks&#x27; vocals channeled Curtis&#x27; &quot;gloomy moan.&quot; &quot;NME&quot;″s Victoria Segal called Joy Division comparisons &quot;obvious and unmistakable, airbourne in the ashen atmospherics,&quot; while praising Interpol&#x27;s take on the &quot;grey-skinned British past&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that Interpol had created an &quot;homage to their particular vision of the &#x27;80s that stands proudly alongside the best of its idols.&quot; Scott Seward, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, remarked: &quot;If I like them because they remind me of eating bad bathtub mescaline in the woods and listening to Cure singles, well, that&#x27;ll do. You might like them for completely different reasons.&quot;

Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; opined that Interpol&#x27;s virtue &quot;lies in the way its music unfurls from pinched openings to wide-open codas&quot;, while Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that their &quot;sleek, melancholy sound is a thing of glacial beauty&quot;. Eric Carr of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; argued that the band had forged their own distinct sound, &quot;a grander, more theatrical atmosphere with lush production that counters their frustrated bombast&quot;, praising &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; as &quot;one of the most strikingly passionate records I&#x27;ve heard this year.&quot; However, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau, naming it &quot;Dud of the Month&quot; in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column, felt that Interpol &quot;exemplify and counsel disengagement, self-seeking, a luxurious cynicism,&quot; downplaying Joy Division comparisons as &quot;too kind&quot;. &quot;Q&quot;″s lukewarm assessment of the album described it as &quot;predictably claustrophobic listening&quot;.

At the end of the year, &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; featured on several publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of 2002, including those of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who named it the year&#x27;s best album, &quot;NME&quot;, who ranked it at number ten, and &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, who ranked it at number five. The album placed at number 15 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s year-end Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

==Legacy==
Hailed as a seminal album of the 2000s, &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; has been cited as an influence on many indie rock bands, including the Killers, Editors, the xx, the Organ, She Wants Revenge, and others to the extent that many of these bands have been disparagingly referred to as &quot;Interpol clones&quot;. Closely associated with 9/11-era New York City, the album has been seen as helping define 2000s indie rock, and Interpol have been cited as helping usher in the New York-born post-punk revival scene, along with contemporaries such as the Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and TV on the Radio. Summing up the album&#x27;s impact in a review of its 2012 re-issue, Matt LeMay of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote: &quot;Suggesting that this album is simply a product of its time and place is no less naive than suggesting that anyone who has ever been in love could easily write, arrange and record an amazing love song. There were a lot of good bands in New York in 2002, but only one band made this record.&quot; In 2017, the band embarked on a worldwide tour to celebrate its 15th anniversary.

In a 2018 interview with Vice, Paul Banks stated: &quot;as far as ease of making it, we had years to write these songs. The longest writing period of any of your records is your debut. We formed in 1997, so it’s five years, and three-and-a-half/four of playing shows and trying out that material. So it went down smoothly in the studio, and then you have all the excitement of it being your first album. It was a good time in our lives.&quot; Drummer Sam Fogarino reflected on the album by saying: &quot;we were very naïve, we didn’t know how to make a record together, and we were lucky to have a good snapshot taken of who we were at the time. And we got a little more confident with every record.&quot;

At the end of the decade, the album has been featured on numerous lists:

<text>Nick News (formerly titled Nick News W/5 and later Nick News with Linda Ellerbee) is an American educational television news magazine aimed at children and teenagers. It originally aired on Nickelodeon from 1992 to 2015. It also aired on Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister network Noggin from 1999 to 2002. &quot;Nick News&quot; took the form of a news program discussing social, political and economic issues in a format intended to be accessible to both children and adults. In June 2020, the show was revived, and in 2024 TikTok and Instagram accounts under the Nick News banner were created.

The show is known for allowing normal American teenagers to speak out on their own personal opinions on a number of past and current worldwide issues and topics, including events such as Black History Month.

==Linda Ellerbee==

&quot;Nick News&quot; was hosted by former NBC News personality Linda Ellerbee from 1992 to 2015. Ellerbee was one of five candidates auditioned over the course of two weeks. She was chosen because her competitors were &quot;too loud and obnoxious&quot;, claimed one of the show&#x27;s set designers. According to Ellerbee: &quot;I was honored when I was named the host of Nick News. The show will be about kids and their everyday lives.&quot; Ellerbee never missed an episode due to illness. The show is officially known as &quot;Nick News with Linda Ellerbee&quot;. Throughout the years, &quot;Nick News&quot; has featured special guests of honor, such as Al Gore, Faith Hill, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Magic Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Dr. Phil.

==History==
&quot;Nick News&quot; was originally known as &quot;Nick News W/5&quot; until the show&#x27;s &quot;who, what, when, where, and why&quot; format was dropped.

During its original run, &quot;Nick News with Linda Ellerbee&quot; was telecast on Sunday nights at 8:00 p.m. and later 8:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon, and ran in repeats at various timeslots. &quot;Nick News&quot; was #1 in the ratings on Nickelodeon in 1992–1993, and has never gone below #6 in the ratings, making it one of the most consistently highly rated news shows on TV. From 1993 to 1997, the first-run syndicated version of the show—distributed by Viacom Enterprises (now CBS Media Ventures)—aired on local stations—both independent and network-affiliated—all over the United States of America. The show won a Peabody Award in 1994, and Linda Ellerbee won a Personal Award in 1998 for her work on the show.

The show also previously appeared on early weekday mornings, fully commercial-free as a part of the television cable industry&#x27;s Cable in the Classroom initiative, which urged teachers from schools across the globe to tape episodes of &quot;Nick News&quot; and show them to their classes during school hours.

The show was a regular part of the lineup on the Noggin channel, one of Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister networks, from February 1999 until March 2002.

TeenNick aired two episodes of the show in repeats on both October 25, 2010, and February 15, 2011, and also aired once as part of their nightly block The Splat from November 5–6, 2016.

&quot;Nick News&quot; is well known for many trademarks during its run on Nickelodeon, such as Ellerbee&#x27;s signature tagline, &quot;If you want to know, ask!&quot;; the only time the sign off was not used was on the finale episode on December 15, 2015, when Ellerbee signed off with the words &quot;And so it goes&quot;; an homage to her previous signoff as anchor of &quot;NBC News Overnight&quot; decades earlier.

After nearly 25 years on the air, an hour-long finale titled &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going: 25 Years of Nick News with Linda Ellerbee&quot; aired on Nickelodeon on December 15, 2015. The episode featured clips from older episodes of the series. The final episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program, a category for which the series had been nominated 22 times, with nine wins across the series&#x27;s 23-year history.

===Revival===
On June 23, 2020, Nickelodeon announced it would be reviving &quot;Nick News&quot; in a series of hour-long specials. The first installment, titled Kids, Race and Unity: A Nick News Special, premiered on June 29 and was hosted by American musician Alicia Keys. &quot;Kids, Race and Unity&quot; was made in direct response to the wave of protests and unrest following the murder of George Floyd, aiming to &quot;amplify the voices and experiences of Black children across the country&quot;. Special guests that appeared on the program included Black Lives Matter co-founders Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi; teen activist Marley Dias, founder of the #1000BlackGirlsBook campaign; 12-year-old singer and viral sensation Keedron Bryant; Ibram X. Kendi, author of &quot;Antiracist Baby&quot;; Teens4Equality founders Jade Fuller, Nya Collins, Zee Thomas, Kennedy Green, Emma Rose Smith and Mikayla Smith; social media star Tabitha Brown and her family; and family therapist, Dr. George James.

In its current iteration, Nickelodeon has partnered with its corporate sibling CBS News on presentation. On October 6, 2020, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; veteran Magalie Laguerre-Wilkinson was tapped as executive producer of the &quot;Nick News&quot; revival and the inaugural vice president of news programming for Nickelodeon. CBS News correspondent Jamie Yuccas serves as the host, while reporters Vladimir Duthiers, Enrique Acevedo, and Imtiaz Tab also contribute. &quot;Nick News&quot; also appears as interstitials during regular Nickelodeon programming to cover current events.

==Notable episodes==
In 1993, a then-12-year-old Meghan Markle was featured after writing letters to get a company to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist.

In 1993, there was an episode on global warming entitled &quot;Plan it for the Planet&quot;. On December 9, 2007, &quot;Nick News&quot; had shown another global warming special entitled &quot;A Global Warning From the Kids of the World&quot;. Both specials looked at different regions of the Earth like Australia, Alaska, the Netherlands, the Philippines, California and Kenya, showing the changes in the climate and the effects of those changes. During the later part of the December 9, 2007, episode, Nobel Prize winner Al Gore talked to children about the issues that global warming is causing for ordinary people.

In 2002, &quot;Nick News&quot; celebrated its 10th anniversary, adds with a special called &quot;Happy Birthday, Nick News&quot;. It featured many flashbacks from the first 10 years of &quot;Nick News&quot;.

On June 18, 2002, Nickelodeon showed &quot;Nick News Special Edition: My Family Is Different&quot;. This had one of the largest audiences in &quot;Nick News&quot;&#x27; history. The show featured regular children talking about different issues that have had a major effect on their personal lives, including hate crimes, child abuse and sexual harassment.

==Video releases==


==Social media revival==

Sometime in 2024, Nick News branded TikTok and Instagram pages were created to post short form informative videos for their audience. The TikTok account uses a pigeon character as a news anchor, while the Instagram account uses real people. The format is the same between both these accounts, having the news be read out by the host while relevant images and videos are displayed (sometimes generated using artificial intelligence). 

The TikTok page resembles a more official version of various TikTok pages (that were created unofficially) featuring an artificially generated rendition of Bikini Bottom News (a news show found in universe within the Nick show SpongeBob SquarePants) designed to read and inform people of breaking news in the real world.

<doc id="1062803" wikidata="Q699107" url="?curid=1062803" title="The Forty Days of Musa Dagh">
<text>The Forty Days of Musa Dagh () is a 1933 novel by Austrian-Bohemian writer Franz Werfel based on events that took place in 1915, during the second year of World War I and at the beginning of the Armenian genocide.

The novel focuses on the self-defense by a small community of Armenians living near Musa Dagh, a mountain in Vilayet of Aleppo in the Ottoman Empire—now in Hatay Province, part of southern Turkey, on the Mediterranean coast—as well the events in Constantinople (Istanbul) and provincial capitals, where the Young Turk government orchestrated the deportations, concentration camps and massacres of the empire&#x27;s Armenian citizens. This policy, as well as who bore responsibility for it, has been controversial and contested since 1915. Because of this or perhaps in spite of it, the facts and scope of the Armenian Genocide were little known until Werfel&#x27;s novel, which entailed voluminous research and is generally accepted as based on historical events.

The novel was originally published in German in November 1933. It achieved great international success and has been credited with awakening the world to the evidence of the persecution and genocide inflicted on the Armenian nation during World War I. &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; also foreshadows the Holocaust of World War II due in part to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, which paralleled the novel&#x27;s creation. In 2012, David R. Godine, Publisher, issued a revised and expanded English translation of &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; that incorporates virtually all of the material left out of Geoffrey Dunlop&#x27;s 1934 translation. Due to Turkish government efforts to prevent development of a film version, only one film adaptation from 1982 has been produced.

==Synopsis==

===Context===
Franz Werfel had served as a corporal and telephone operator in the Austro-Hungarian Army artillery during the First World War on the Russian front and later as a propaganda writer for the Military Press Bureau (with Rainer Maria Rilke and others) in Vienna. The horrors he witnessed during the war, as well as the banality of the civil and military bureaucracies, served him well during the course of writing the book. His reason for writing the novel came as a result of a trip through Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon from January through March 1930 and is given in a prefatory note in the novel:

This book was conceived in March of the year 1929 [sic], during the course of a stay in Damascus. The miserable sight of maimed and famished-looking refugee children, working in a carpet factory, gave me the final impulse to snatch the incomprehensible destiny of the Armenian people from the Hell of all that had taken place. The writing of the book followed between July 1932 and March 1933. Meanwhile, in November, on a lecture tour through German cities, the author selected Chapter 5 of Book One for public readings. It was read in its present form, based on the historic records of a conversation between Enver Pasha and Pastor Johannes Lepsius.

Werfel does not mention here that he rewrote much of the novel in May 1933, responding to events in Nazi Germany and kept revising it up until it was published. Later, speaking to reporters, Werfel elaborated: &quot;The struggle of 5,000 people on Musa Dagh had so fascinated me that I wished to aid the Armenian people by writing about it and bringing it to the world.&quot;

===Book One: Coming Events===
Werfel&#x27;s narrative style is omniscient as well as having a &quot;polyfocus&quot;, in which he moves the perspective from character to character and to the third person perspective. For that reason, the connection between the author&#x27;s consciousness and that of his characters can almost read seamlessly. This is evident as the novel opens in the spring of 1915, during the second year of the World War I.

Gabriel Bagradian, a wealthy Armenian from Paris, has returned to his native village of Yoghonoluk, one of seven villages in Aleppo Vilayet, now Hatay Province, Turkey. (Bagradian&#x27;s character was inspired by the figure of , whose Armenian first name was the same as that of the mountain.) His view is dominated by a familiar and looming presence in this paradisiac landscape—Musa Dagh—which means Mount Moses in Turkish (Musa Ler is the Armenian for Mount Moses). He thinks about his return to settle the affairs of his dead older brother and entertains pleasant reveries of his childhood, as well as more serious matters. Bagradian feels both proud and estranged from his Armenian roots, and throughout the novel Werfel develops this theme of estrangement, which is denoted with the book&#x27;s first sentence, the question: ″How did I get here?″ Bagradian also considers his French wife Juliette and their son Stephan, and how they will adjust to their new environment, given the state of war that now exists and prevents their return.

Other important characters are introduced in Book One: Juliette, Stephan and the many Armenian characters—chief, among them the Gregorian head priest, Ter Haigasun; the local physician, Dr. Altouni; the apothecary–polymath Krikor and the Greek American journalist, Gonzague Maris—all characters drawn from Armenian survivors of the events of 1915, as well as from Werfel&#x27;s family, friends, acquaintances and himself. Indeed, he personally informs several characters ranging from the assimilated outsider-hero (Bagradian) to self-parody (the schoolteacher Oskanian).

Bagradian considers himself a loyal citizen of the Ottoman Empire, even a patriot, eschewing the more radical Armenian parties, such as the socialist Hunchaks. He had served as an artillery officer in the 1912 Balkan War, had been involved in the progressive wing of Turkish politics and had been a vocal Armenian supporter of the CUP and the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. Being a reserve officer, Bagradian becomes suspicious when he is not called up; learning that Turkish authorities have seized the internal passports of Armenian citizens further fuels his suspicions. So he goes to the district capital of Antioch (now Antakya), to inquire about his military status. In a Turkish bath, he overhears a group of Turks, among them the district governor, the Kaimikam, discussing the central government&#x27;s plan to do something about its &quot;Armenian problem&quot;. Bagradian is alarmed by what he hears and the danger, given the history of atrocities committed on Armenians, whose rise as the empire&#x27;s chief professional and mercantile class had alarmed Turkish nationalists. The dangers that this poses to his family are corroborated by an old friend of the Bagradian family, Agha Rifaat Bereket, a pious dervish (Sufi Muslim ascetic) who sees the Young Turks as apostates.

Back in Yoghonoluk, Bagradian begins to socialize with the Armenian community. His grandfather had a paternal relationship with the Armenian villages that dot the land around Musa Dagh, a role that Gabriel Bagradian assumes, not intending to be a real leader but rather to help his French wife adapt to what could be a long exile in the Turkish Levant.

Despite the rumors of arrests and deportations, trickling in from Constantinople (Istanbul) and other Ottoman cities, many of Musa Dagh&#x27;s Armenians remain unconcerned about the outside world. It is not until four refugees arrive in Yoghonoluk in late April, that the full nature of what the Ottoman government is doing becomes clear, for the refugees bring news of the brutal suppression of an Armenian uprising, in the city of Zeitun and the mass deportation that followed. In a long passage, Werfel tells the story of Zeitun and introduces three more important characters of the book, the Protestant pastor Aram Tomasian, his pregnant wife Hovsannah, his sister Iskuhi, a quasi-feral orphan girl named Sato, and a houseboy named Kevork. Kevork, as a child, had suffered brain damage at the hands of the Turks. Iskuhi is the victim of a more recent atrocity: Her left arm is paralyzed from fending off a rape attempt. Despite her deformity, the Armenian girl&#x27;s beauty and eyes attract Bagradian.

The story the refugees tell causes Bagradian and the Armenians who live around Musa Dagh, to seriously consider resisting the Ottomans. Bagradian steps forward to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the villages and looks to the natural defenses of Musa Dagh and its environs. Ter Haigasun becomes his ally, in convincing the Armenian villagers of the peril.

Book One introduces a German Protestant missionary Johannes Lepsius, a real person, and Enver Pasha, the Ottoman War Minister, who with Talaat Pasha and Djemal Pasha (the Three Pashas), constitute the triumvirate that ruled the Ottoman Empire. The chapter, titled ″Interlude of the Gods,″ reveals the Turkish point of view vis-à-vis the Armenians and the West. Werfel intended his depiction, almost entirely drawn verbatim from Lepsius&#x27;s published account, to be sympathetic and damning, especially when Enver consults with Talaat on the progress of the deportations.

The remainder of Book One describes which Armenians decide on resistance and which on cooperating with the deportation order. Bagradian camps out with his family and friends on Musa Dagh, to ensure that it is the right place to make a stand. Those who decide to resist, dig up a cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908, when they were allies of the Young Turks and subsequently bury their church bells, so that these do not fall into Turkish hands. Eventually, the Ottoman military police, the dreaded saptiehs, arrive led by the red-haired müdir. They instruct the Armenians to prepare for deportations—and then leave after beating Ter Haigasun and Bagradian. Instead of complying, the 6,000 Armenians march with everything they can carry, their animals and their weapons to a plateau on Musa Dagh. Bagradian hangs behind and observes the wailing women and the other graveyard folk—who represent the old ways and sympathetic magic of pagan Armenia—sacrifice a goat. Its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary. The chapter ends with Bagradian helping Krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the Damlayik, the plateau the Armenians have chosen as their refuge.

===Book Two: The Struggle of the Weak===
Book Two opens during the high summer of 1915, with the establishment of the Armenian encampment and defenses, the Town Enclosure, Three Tent Square, South Bastion, Dish Terrace and other sites on Musa Dagh, that become familiar place names during the course of the novel. A division of labor is established, as to who will fight, who will care for livestock, who will make guns and munitions and so on. A communal society is established, despite the objections of the propertied class. The objective is to hold out long enough to attract the ships of the British and French navies, patrolling the eastern Mediterranean in support of the Allied invasion of Gallipoli.

Characters who will figure in the defense of the mountain also come into more relief, such as the loner and Ottoman Army deserter Sarkis Kilikian (who suffered the loss of his entire family during the pogrom-like Hamidian massacres) and the former drillmaster, Chaush Nurhan. Indeed, Musa Dagh is presented as a microcosm of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Armenian life, as well as being a test not only of Bagradian&#x27;s leadership but a test of his marriage and fatherhood.

The Ottoman soldiers and saptiehs seriously underestimate the Armenians and their first engagement results in a Turkish rout. The victory forces the Turks to assemble a larger force; it enhances Bagradian&#x27;s reputation, reconnects him to his people and isolates him from Juliette and Stephan.

Stephan reconnects with his Armenian roots but the difficulty he experiences because of his Westernized childhood, makes the novel a coming-of-age story, as well as a classic tale of love and war on the scale of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. He wants to be an authentic Armenian, like his rival Haik and other boys. To prove himself to them, Stephan organizes a raid on a fruit orchard to replenish the Armenians&#x27; stores and to prove himself to Iskuhi, for he is as much bewitched by her as his father. He leaves Musa Dagh to fetch back Iskuhi&#x27;s bible, left behind in his father&#x27;s deserted house. (A long passage left out of the first English translation.)

Juliette apprehends the growing estrangement of her husband and son, seeking purpose and solace in nursing the Armenian wounded and in her friendship with Gonzague Maris, which develops into a passionate affair. As the Turks resume their attacks, he tries to convince Juliette to abandon her family and the mountain. The battles include a heroic stand led by Kilikian, as well as Stephan&#x27;s sniping attack on a Turkish gun emplacement. He and the other boys seize two field guns, a feat that forces the Turks to withdraw.

Book Two features a traditional funeral for the Armenian dead, including the ceremonies of the wailing women, who assist in the birth of Aram Tomasian&#x27;s son, a difficult delivery that is seen as ominous while conditions in the camp start to deteriorate, for the Armenian victories can only buy time. Jemal Pasha is introduced in Book Two and is portrayed as a resentful member of the triumvirate, pathologically jealous of Enver. The relationship between Bagradian and Iskuhi also comes into focus, as it is conducted openly but only consummated on a spiritual plane. Their love is interrupted by a reinforced Ottoman attack, which is repelled. Bagradian orders a massive forest fire, to surround the Armenian encampment with a no-man&#x27;s land of fire, smoke, and open terrain. Book Two ends with Sato exposing Juliette and Gonzague making love, Juliette coming down with typhus and Gonzague&#x27;s escape. Stephan leaves the camp with Haik, on a mission to contact the American envoy in Antioch.

===Book Three: Disaster, Rescue, The End===
The scene changes to Constantinople and Johannes Lepsius&#x27;s meeting with members of a dervish order called the ″Thieves of the Heart.″ It was important to Werfel to show that the Young Turks and the Three Pashas did not represent Turkish society. It was also important to show that Enver was right on certain points in regard to the Western powers, which had exploited Turkey and treated it throughout the nineteenth century as a virtual colony. Most of the first chapter of Book Three is written as a dramatic dialogue, during which Lepsius witnesses the Sufi whirling devotions and learns first-hand about the deep resentment against the West—especially Western &quot;progress&quot; as instituted by the Young Turks—and the atrocities in concentration camps set up in the Mesopotamian desert for deported Armenians. He also encounters Bagradian&#x27;s friend, Agha Rifaat Bereket. The latter agrees to bring supplies to Musa Dagh, purchased with funds collected by Lepsius in Germany. The episode ends with Lepsius witnessing Enver and Talaat being driven past in a limousine. When the car suffers two loud tire punctures, Lepsius at first thinks they have been assassinated (which foreshadows the real deaths of Talaat and Djemal by Armenian assassins).

The chapter that follows resumes with Stephan and Haik. They encounter the inshaat taburi, notorious forced labor details composed of Armenian draftees into the Ottoman Army and travel through a swamp, where Stephan and Haik form a real friendship. It is cut short, when Stephan falls ill; he is cared for by a Turkmen farmer, another of the righteous Muslims that Werfel represents in The Forty Days of Musa Dagh. Too sick to continue on the mission to Antioch, Stephan is returned to Yoghonoluk, which has been resettled by Muslim refugees, from war zones of the Ottoman Empire. Stephan is discovered to be Bagradian&#x27;s son and a spy and is brutally murdered.

Stephan′s death causes Bagradian to withdraw for a time, during which Turkish soldiers capture the last of the Armenian livestock. This disaster opens rifts in Musa Dagh′s society and resolve. Other setbacks follow; with the arrival of a seasoned Ottoman general from the Gallipoli front, as well as reinforcements from the regular army. The Ottomans begin to tighten the noose around Musa Dagh. Bagradian recovers from his grief, to form guerrilla bands to disrupt the Ottoman advance and buy more time. No ships have been sighted and attempts to contact the Allies or to seek the diplomatic intercession of the United States, still a neutral power, or Turkey&#x27;s ally, Imperial Germany, come to naught.

Bagradian derives strength and comfort from Iskuhi, who has volunteered to care for Juliette. Iskuhi sees the end coming and the likelihood that their love entails dying together, not a life. When the Agha′s mission arrives, he finds the Armenians starving. He can do little though, since the red-haired müdir has confiscated most of the supplies, that were intended for the Armenians as a humanitarian gesture, approved by Turkey&#x27;s highest religious authority. The camp, filled with smoke from the forest fires, inspires a vision in him that anticipates the Holocaust and the death camps of World War II.

The Armenian camp and resistance faces its greatest challenge from within, when criminal elements among the Ottoman Army deserters—whom Bagradian allowed to help in Musa Dagh&#x27;s offense—go on a rampage. As Ter Haigasun prepares to celebrate a mass to ask for God&#x27;s help, the deserters set the altar on fire and the resulting conflagration destroys much of the Town Enclosure, before the uprising is suppressed by Bagradian&#x27;s men.

The Ottomans see the fire and prepare for the final assault. Oskanian leads a suicide cult, for those who do not want to die in enemy hands, given the Turks′ reputation for violent reprisals. The little teacher refuses to jump off a cliff, after fending off the last of his followers. Soon after, he discovers the large Red Cross distress flag, the Armenians flew to attract Allied ships and sights the French cruiser &quot;Guichen&quot; in the fog. It had diverted course after its watch spotted the burning of the Armenian camp on Musa Dagh. As Oskanian waves the flag, the warship begins shelling the coast. Soon more ships come. The Turks withdraw and the Armenians are rescued.

Bagradian remains behind after ensuring that the people he led, Juliette and Iskuhi are safely aboard the French and British ships. His reasons are complex and can be traced throughout the novel to the realization that he cannot leave and go into exile again in an internment camp in Port Said, Egypt. He now imagines that Iskuhi follows him back up Musa Dagh from the sea. On the way, he experiences a divine presence and confronts the cross on his son&#x27;s grave. He is followed by a skirmishing party of Turkish troops. They approach in a crescent—which alludes to the battle formations of the Ottoman armies of the past—and kill him.

==Release==

===Initial reception and censorship===

&quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; received much critical praise from Austrian and Swiss reviewers when the book, over 900 pages long, was published in two volumes in November 1933. For several years the novel could be read in Nazi Germany despite book burnings that included Werfel&#x27;s previous titles and the increasing number of proscribed Jewish authors and their books. In February 1934, with strong pressure by the Turkish government in Ankara, &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; was banned in the Third Reich. &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot;, the official newspaper of the SS, painted Werfel as an agent who created the &quot;alleged Turkish horrors perpetrated against the Armenians&quot; and also denounced &quot;America&#x27;s Armenian Jews for promoting in the U.S.A. the sale of Werfel&#x27;s book.&quot; Through a decree issued by Prime Minister İsmet İnönü in January 1935, the book was banned in Turkey. It was translated into Turkish and published in Turkey only in 1997, by Belge Publishing House under the name &quot;Musa Dağ&#x27;da Kırk Gün&quot;.

Werfel was devastated by the loss of his German readership, but the novel was soon published in an English translation in November 1934, which sold 34,000 copies in the first two weeks. This translation by Geoffrey Dunlop omitted scenes of violence and rape that Dunlop believed would cause anxiety in readers in the United States and the United Kingdom and descriptions of the culture and society of the Armenians. According to Neal Ascherson, Werfel was only interested in collecting the royalties paid from the translations and that otherwise he did not care what happened to the English version, and that the public at the time did not draw attention to the abridgement.

Louis Kronenberger, the editor of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; described &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; as &quot;A story which must rouse the emotions of all human beings ... Werfel has made it a noble novel. Unlike most other important novels, &quot;Musa Dagh&quot; is richest in story, a story of men accepting the fate of heroes ... It gives us the lasting sense of participation in a stirring episode of history. Magnificent.&quot; Kronenberger also recognized the novel&#x27;s filmic qualities: &quot;If Hollywood does not mar and mishandle it, it should make a magnificent movie.&quot; Few realized that the English translation had been abridged to fit one volume and that controversial passages had been omitted, to streamline the narrative and make the book less offensive to readers. Other translations, among the 34 produced were also redacted. The book was never censored in a way that placated the Turkish government, which felt Werfel misrepresented what had happened in 1915. &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; posed a small public relations disaster for the modern, secular Republic of Turkey of its president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who sought to distance Turkey from the old Ottoman past and the Young Turks who lost most of the empire during World War I. A film version posed an even greater threat.

===Importance to Armenians, Jews, and other victims of genocide===
Werfel&#x27;s novel made him famous among Armenians, according to his biographer, Peter Stephan Jungk. Citing Father Bezdikian, an Armenian priest living in Venice, Italy whose grandfather served and fought during the siege: &quot;Franz Werfel is the national hero of the Armenian people. His great book is a kind of consolation to us—no, not a consolation, there is no such thing—but it is of eminent importance to us that this book exists. It guarantees that it can never be forgotten, never, what happened to our people.&quot; Ascherson stated: &quot;For Armenians, it remains unique and precious: for all its minor inaccuracies, it&#x27;s the one work whose urgency and passion keeps the truth of their genocide before the eyes of a world that would prefer to forget about it.&quot;

Many Armenians in the Diaspora read the abridged English edition for years, which lacked many of the scenes of Armenian life. With these scenes restored in the revised and expanded edition of 2012, the novel&#x27;s meaning to Armenians is all the more poignant, as Vartan Gregorian writes in the preface: &quot;&quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; was meant as a memorial set against a new historical phenomenon that had been described as the murder of a nation, the extermination of a race, and the assassination of Armenia ... &quot;. The novel, in its expanded form, has even more relevance as a document of genocide. &quot;[I]t is truly remarkable,&quot; continues Gregorian, &quot;to consider how closely &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; foreshadows the cataclysm that would befall the Jews of Germany and Eastern Europe at the hands of the Nazis.&quot; As historian and scholar Yair Auron writes, &quot;The reader of this extraordinary novel will find it difficult to believe that the book was written before the Holocaust.&quot;

Not all Armenians could express their support for the book; some were forced to protest against its publication and any attempt to turn it into a movie, notably the surviving Armenian community of Istanbul denounced Werfel&#x27;s book and burned it in a public ritual, similar to contemporary Nazi book burning ceremonies in Germany and elsewhere. A group of Armenians gathered around in the courtyard of Istanbul&#x27;s Pangalti Armenian Church and set fire to copies of the book. As a final symbolic humiliation imposed upon them, they were made to not only renounce the author but also reject the book&#x27;s content, effectively denouncing themselves and denying their own history. The Jewish community of Istanbul similarly denounced Werfel in 1934. According to Ascherson, the Armenian and Jewish communities in Istanbul were coerced into criticizing the novel.

Jews worldwide welcomed &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; and readily saw the parallels Werfel (himself Jewish) had drawn between them and the Armenians, especially the resentment and persecution both societies endured in the nineteenth century, when each benefited and suffered from governmental liberalization policies and the economic success that such policies engendered along with the Industrial Revolution. The old Armenian saying in the novel—&quot;To be an Armenian is an impossibility&quot;—resonated with Jews living in Europe and Palestine.

The novel&#x27;s importance grew during World War II. Musa Dagh has often been compared to resistance in Jewish ghettos. Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote that it was the most-read book in the Warsaw ghetto. The Białystok Ghetto population found itself in a similar situation as Musa Dagh, in February 1943, when Mordecai Tannenbaum, an inmate of the Vilna ghetto, was sent with others to organize resistance there. The record of one of the meetings organizing the revolt, suggests that the novel was used as a guide for resistance: &quot;Only one thing remains for us: to organize collective resistance in the ghetto, at any cost; to consider the ghetto our &#x27;Musa Dagh&#x27;, to write a proud chapter of Jewish Białystok and our movement into history&quot; noted Tannenbaum. Copies of the novel were said to have been &quot;passed from hand to hand&quot; among the ghetto defenders who likened their situation to that of the Armenians. According to extensive statistical records kept by Herman Kruk at the Vilna ghetto library, the book was the most popular among ghetto readership, as is recounted in memoirs by survivors who worked at the library.

Many Jews in the Palestinian Mandate contemplated retreating to Mount Carmel and organizing a defense line, due to prospects of a Nazi invasion of the region. Known alternatively as the &quot;Northern Program&quot;, &quot;The Carmel Plan&quot;, &quot;The Massada Plan&quot;, and the &quot;Musa Dagh Plan&quot;, it was envisioned as a bastion against Nazi incursions, to hold out for at least three to four months. Meri Batz, one of the leaders of the Jewish militias who had also read the novel, stated that the community wished to &quot;turn Carmel into the Musa Dagh of Palestinian Jewry ... We put our faith in the power of the Jewish &#x27;Musa Dagh&#x27; and were determined to hold out for at least three to four months.&quot;

=== Revised translation ===
James Reidel revised the Dunlop translation by including all of the material previously removed, and this new edition was published in the United States and the United Kingdom, with UK publishing occurring in 2018. Penguin Books did not include the introduction in the UK edition, something Ascherson criticized.

==Historical notes==
The Armenian resistance on Musa Dagh lasted, contrary to the book&#x27;s title, for 53 days. The change of the days by Werfel &quot;called up 
biblical associations: the flood lasted forty days and nights; Moses spent forty days and nights on Mount Sinai; Israel&#x27;s time in the wilderness was forty years.&quot;

Werfel&#x27;s account of the French navy&#x27;s role in the evacuation of Musa Dagh in September 1915 is based on official French diplomatic and naval archives that he secured through contacts at the French embassy in Vienna. Those ships that took part are accurately named, and included the French protected cruiser &quot;Guichen&quot; under Commander Jean-Joseph Brisson and the armored cruiser &quot;Jeanne D&#x27;Arc&quot; under the command of Vice-Admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet, who received a posthumous medal from the French government in October 2010 for his role in transporting the 4,000 people left on the Damlayik to Port Said, Egypt.

Werfel&#x27;s Bagradian was inspired by the town&#x27;s defense leader, . Unlike Bagradian, however, he survived the siege and moved to Beirut, Lebanon several years after the war ended and lived there for the next 70 years, becoming a doctor and serving in Lebanon&#x27;s government for several decades as a quiet and shy member of Parliament. Derkalousdian died at the age of 99 in 1986.

==Film adaptation==
===Objections and obstructions of initial attempts===
Before &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; was published in English, Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) secured the film rights from Werfel&#x27;s publisher, Paul Zsolnay Verlag and had the novel translated for the studio scriptwriters. Despite reservations on the part of legal counsel, who felt such a film would offend the Turkish government, MGM started pre-production work in 1934 and tentatively cast a rising young star named Clark Gable to play Gabriel Bagradian. When reports surfaced in the Hollywood press about the film late in 1934, Turkey&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, Mehmed Münir Ertegün, was ordered by his government to prevent it from being made. As the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey was intent on suppressing any mention of the Armenian Genocide.

Ertegün turned to the U.S. State Department and told it that he &quot;earnestly hoped that [the movie studio] would desist from presenting any such picture, which would give a distorted version of the alleged massacres.&quot; The State Department tried to assure Ertegün that the film would not include any material that would offend Turkey but Ertegün remained adamant. The State Department attempted to mollify the Turkish government by presenting it with the final script, although this did not satisfy it either. The scriptwriters offered several watered-down versions but the Turkish government refused to budge.

MGM&#x27;s production chief was astonished by this level of interference by a foreign power, declaring, ″To hell with the Turks, I&#x27;m going to make the picture anyway.″ The fact that MGM planned to move forward with the production further enraged Turkey. Speaking to an MGM official, Ertegün threatened that ″If the movie is made, Turkey will launch a worldwide campaign against it. It rekindles the Armenian Question. The Armenian Question is settled.″ Ertegün′s threats were soon being echoed across the Turkish press. In a September 3, 1935 editorial, colored with anti-Semitic overtones, the Istanbul Turkish-language daily &quot;Haber&quot; opined:

In the face of this pressure, Louis B. Mayer of MGM, conceded to Turkish demands and the film was scrapped. Michael Bobelian, a lawyer and a journalist, observes that the ″&quot;Musa Dagh&quot; incident is critical in understanding the evolution of Turkey&#x27;s campaign of denying the crimes committed by the Young Turks ... The standoff with MGM revealed that Turkey would pressure foreign governments to go along with its policy of denial.″

In the early 1960s, an English publisher, Gordon Landsborough, attempted to produce a film version of the book and wrote a film treatment for it. When he discovered that MGM still held the film rights he attempted to buy them but was unsuccessful as MGM announced their interest in filming it, using a script by Carl Foreman. Landsborough wrote in 1965 of rumours of political pressure holding up that new MGM production. Another movie version was mentioned in the 1967 sales film &quot;Lionpower from MGM&quot;, as being slated for production in 1968–1969 but nothing came of this version either.

===1982 film===
In the 1970s, MGM sold its rights to &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; and after several abortive attempts, the novel was finally turned into a movie in 1982, directed by Sarky Mouradian with screenplay by Alex Hakobian. It was a low-budget, low-profile production that seriously abridged the original.

===Subsequent attempts and adaptations===
In 2006, Sylvester Stallone expressed his desire to direct a film about &quot;Musa Dagh&quot;, according to Professor Savaş Eğilmez of Atatürk University. An e-mail campaign sponsored by the Armenian-genocide denying Foundation for the Struggle Against Baseless Allegations of Genocide (ASİMED), pressured Stallone into not proceeding with the film. In early 2009, reports surfaced that Mel Gibson was also considering directing a documentary and appearing in the adaptation of Werfel&#x27;s novel but was dissuaded after receiving 3,000 e-mails from a Turkish pressure group.

In 2016, a feature film, &quot;The Promise&quot;, starring Christian Bale, appeared, which bears some resemblance to Werfel′s novel and draws from the same source material.

<text>Duntroon is a locality in the city of Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory.

==History==

Robert Campbell&#x27;s property Duntroon was situated on the limestone plains of New South Wales in the area that is now covered by the ACT.

Given government compensation for the loss of his ship the while under government charter, Robert Campbell, sent James Ainslie to collect 700 sheep from the government flocks at Bathurst and to go southward looking for suitable pasture.

Ainslie reached the Limestone Plains and selected a site on the slopes above the Molonglo River where the Royal Military College now stands. In 1825 Campbell applied for and received his grant, naming it &quot;Duntroon&quot; after the family castle, Duntrune Castle on Loch Crinan in Argyll, Scotland. Duntrune Castle on Loch Crinan in Argyll, Scotland was sold to clan Malcolm in 1792, long before this.

In 1833, Campbell built &quot;Duntroon House&quot; out of stone with wide verandahs. In 1862 Robert&#x27;s son George added a large two-storey extension. In its final form the house contained twenty rooms and is a great example of colonial architecture. It now serves as the officers&#x27; mess for the Royal Military College, Duntroon and is situated in the suburb of Campbell.

&quot;Duntroon House&quot; was the centre of activity for Campbell&#x27;s station. Gardens were established around the house including many exotic trees and an intricate maze was grown also a conservatory, orchard, vineyard and dairy farm were built in the surrounding area.

Duntroon was recommended as the site for Australia&#x27;s Military College by Lord Kitchener, who had been commissioned in 1910 to report on the country&#x27;s defence needs. Initially the government rented Duntroon for two years before obtaining the title to Duntroon and its surrounding 360 acres (1.5 km2) through the creation of the Australian Capital Territory.

On 27 June 1911 the Royal Military College opened at Duntroon.

== Prisoner of War National Memorial ==
The Prisoner of War National Memorial is located at Duntroon. It consists of the Changi Chapel, which was originally constructed by Australian and British prisoners of war in Singapore in 1944. It was dismantled at the end of the war, packed away and taken to a military store in Australia. It was reconstructed using old diagrams and notes from the architect Hamish Cameron-Smith and unveiled in 1988 to commemorate the POWs.
==Geology==
In the east calcareous shales from the Canberra Formation is overlain by Quaternary alluvium. This rock is the limestone in the original name of Canberra &quot;Limestone Plains&quot;. The Narrabundah Ashstone is part of this formation and can be seen in the easternmost corner. In the higher west including Mount Pleasant is grey quartz andesite from the Ainslie Volcanics. Around Australian Defence Force Academy is grey dacite from the Ainslie Volcanics.

Geology of the Australian Capital Territory covers more of the geology of the ACT.

<doc id="1062812" wikidata="Q1668000" url="?curid=1062812" title="Internet Storage Name Service">
<text>In computing, the proposed Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol allows automated discovery, management and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices (using iFCP gateways) on a TCP/IP network.

== Features ==

iSNS provides management services similar to those found in Fibre Channel networks, allowing a standard IP network to operate in much the same way that a Fibre Channel storage area network does. Because iSNS is able to emulate Fibre Channel fabric services and manage both iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices, an iSNS server can be used as a consolidated configuration point for an entire storage network. However, the use of iSNS is optional for iSCSI while it is required for iFCP. Additionally, an iSNS implementation is not required by the standard to provide support for both of these protocols.

== Components ==

The iSNS standard defines four components:

; The iSNS Protocol: iSNSP is a protocol that specifies how iSNS clients and servers communicate. It is intended to be used by various platforms, including switches and targets as well as server hosts.

; iSNS Clients: iSNS clients are part of iSNSP aware storage devices. iSNS clients initiate transactions with iSNS servers using the iSNSP, register device attribute information in a common Discovery Domain (DD), download information about other registered clients and receive asynchronous notification of events that occur in their DD(s).

; iSNS Servers: iSNS servers respond to iSNS protocol queries and requests made by iSNS clients using the iSNSP. iSNS servers initiate iSNSP State Change Notifications and store properly authenticated information submitted by a registration request in an iSNS database.

; iSNS Databases: iSNS databases are the information repositories for iSNS server(s). They maintain information about iSNS client attributes; while implementations will vary, a directory-enabled implementation of iSNS, for example, might store client attributes in an LDAP directory.

== Services ==

An iSNS implementation provides four primary services:

*Name registration and storage resource discovery
*Discovery domains and login control
*State-change notification
*Bidirectional mappings between Fibre Channel and iSCSI devices

=== Name registration and storage resource discovery ===

iSNS implementations allow all entities in a storage network to register and query an iSNS database. Both targets and initiators can register with the iSNS database, and each entity can inquire about other initiators and targets. For example, a client initiator can obtain information about target devices from an iSNS server.

=== Discovery domains and login control ===

Administrators can use the discovery domains to divide storage nodes into manageable, non-exclusive groups. By grouping storage nodes, administrators are able to limit the login process of each host to the most appropriate subset of targets registered with the iSNS, which allows the storage network to scale by reducing the number of unnecessary logins and by limiting the amount of time each host spends establishing login relationships.

Each target is able to use login control to delegate their access control and authorization policies to an iSNS server. Such delegation is intended to promote centralized management.

=== State-change notification ===

The state-change notification (SCN) service allows an iSNS server to issue notifications about each event that affects storage nodes on the managed network. Each iSNS client may register for notifications on behalf of its storage nodes, and each client is expected to respond according to its own requirements and implementation.

=== Bidirectional mappings between Fibre Channel and iSCSI devices ===

Because the iSNS database stores naming and discovery information about both Fibre Channel and iSCSI devices, iSNS servers are able to store mappings of Fibre Channel devices to proxy iSCSI device images on the IP network. These mappings may also be made in the opposite direction, allowing iSNS servers to store mappings from iSCSI devices to proxy World Wide Names (WWNs).

<text>Robert Morgan Hyatt (born 1948) is an American computer scientist and programmer. He co-authored the computer chess programs Crafty and Cray Blitz which won two World Computer Chess Championships in the 1980s. Hyatt was a computer science professor at the University of Southern Mississippi (1970–1985) and University of Alabama at Birmingham (1988–2016).

== Early life and education ==
Hyatt was born in Laurel, Mississippi in 1948. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1970 and an M.S. in 1983, both from the University of Southern Mississippi. His master&#x27;s dissertation was titled &quot;Cray Blitz: A Computer Chess Playing Program&quot;. Hyatt earned a Ph.D. in computer and information sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1988. His thesis was titled &quot;A High-Performance Parallel Algorithm to Search Depth-First Game Trees&quot;. Bruce Wilsey Suter was Hyatt&#x27;s doctoral advisor.

== Career ==
Hyatt is co-author of the computer chess program Crafty and the co-author of Cray Blitz, a two-time winner of the World Computer Chess Championships. He has been actively involved in computer chess since he first started to program a computer to play chess in 1968. These efforts have been supported by various computer vendors such as Univac (1978), Cray Research (1980–1994), and more recently AMD via their developer&#x27;s lab. Crafty is freely available both in executable form (from many different web sites) and in source form (from Hyatt&#x27;s home page). Crafty presently participates in many computer chess tournaments (and an occasional human chess tournament). An old version of the source of Cray Blitz is also available on the internet for those interested in seeing what computer chess looked like in the late 1980s.

Hyatt taught computer science for 46 years, from 1970 through 1985 at the University of Southern Mississippi and from 1985 through 2016 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He retired in 2016 as an associate professor of computer science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences (1988–2016).
