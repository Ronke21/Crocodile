<text>Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner (also known as Joseph T. Tykociner; 5 October 1877, in Włocławek, Congress Poland – 11 June 1969, in Urbana, Illinois, United States) was a Polish engineer and a pioneer of sound-on-film technology.

In 1921 he became the first research professor of engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Within a year of his arrival at the university, he conducted the first sound-on-film motion picture recordings at a physics demonstration that showed how pictures and sound could be synchronized to produce a &quot;talkie&quot;, a motion picture with sound.

==Life==
Tykociner was born into a Jewish family in Włocławek, a town in Polish territory then under Russian control. He worked for the Marconi Company in 1901 in London at the time the first radio signal was transmitted across the Atlantic. At the age of eighteen he came to the United States. In New York City he met Nikola Tesla and became an expert in shortwave radio. He received a jeweled gold watch from Czar Nicholas II for setting up a radio communication system for the Russian fleet. He was at St. Petersburg&#x27;s Helsinki Station when Lenin returned from exile in 1917. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he worked on radio for the Polish government.

===Sound film===
He worked from 1918 to develop a system of recording and reproducing synchronized sound on motion picture film. He became the University of Illinois&#x27;s first research professor of engineering in 1921. On June 9, 1922, Tykociner publicly demonstrated for the first time a motion picture with a soundtrack optically recorded directly onto the film. When Tykociner demonstrated the first sound-on-film motion picture recordings the projector had a photoelectric cell made by his Illinois colleague Jakob Kunz at its heart. In the first sounds ever publicly heard from a composite image-and-audio film, Helena Tykociner, the inventor&#x27;s wife, spoke the words, &quot;I will ring,&quot; and then rang a bell. Next, Ellery Paine, head of the university&#x27;s Department of Electrical Engineering, recited the Gettysburg Address. The demonstration was written up in the &quot;New York World&quot; on July 30, 1922. A dispute between Tykociner and university president David Kinley over patent rights to the process thwarted its commercial application.

Tykociner applied for a patent shortly before the public demonstration. The patent was awarded in 1926. Many people consider Theodore Case as the inventor of the sound film even though Tykociński made sound film 3 years before him. In 1919, Lee De Forest filed patents for his sound-on-film process Phonofilm, unaware of Tykociner&#x27;s work. DeForest, working with Theodore Case, produced several short films in 1921 and 1922, and introduced Phonofilm at a presentation at the Rivoli Theater in New York City on April 15, 1923. Case and DeForest had a falling out, and Case took his patents to William Fox, who used Case&#x27;s patents to develop Fox Movietone.

===Radar===
In the 1920s, Tykociner did antenna design research that was a precursor to radar.

===Zetetics===

After his official retirement in 1946, he did research in a new field he termed &quot;zetetics,&quot; (not to be confused with zeteticism, Marcello Truzzi&#x27;s term for scientific skepticism), which Tykociński-Tykociner described as the collection and systematization of &quot;all information about research activities, including creative processes, with the view of extending that knowledge which leads to discoveries, inventions, and the solution of human problems.&quot; This included the study of the science of research and the relationship between science and art.
When he died in 1969 in Urbana, Illinois, his estate and papers were left to the university.

The Tykociner Memorial Lectures began in 1972 with a lecture by Dennis Gabor. Through 1998, other distinguished scientists and artists spoke on the relationship between science and the arts, including Leon Cooper, Leon Lederman, and Freeman Dyson. In 2002 the lectures were changed to weekly lectures in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

<doc id="1063926" wikidata="Q1091758" url="?curid=1063926" title="Cidlina">
<text>The Cidlina () is a river in the Czech Republic, a right tributary of the Elbe River. It originates in the Liberec Region, but flows mainly through the Hradec Králové and Central Bohemian regions. It is long.

==Etymology==
According to one theory, the name of the river is of Celtic origin and was composed of the words &quot;sīd(o)&quot; (meaning &#x27;calm&#x27; or &#x27;peace&#x27;) and &quot;lèana&quot; (meaning &#x27;wet meadow&#x27;). According to another theory, the name comes from the Proto-Slavic adjective &quot;cědlá&quot;, which meant &#x27;clear&#x27;, &#x27;clean&#x27;.

==Characteristic==

The Cidlina originates in the territory of Lomnice nad Popelkou in the Ještěd–Kozákov Ridge at an elevation of and flows to Libice nad Cidlinou, where it enters the Elbe River at an elevation of . About 1.5 km south of the main spring there is the secondary spring of the Cidlina. The river is long. Its drainage basin has an area of .

The longest tributaries of the Cidlina are:
==Settlements==
The most notable settlement on the river is the town of Jičín. The river flows through the municipal territories of Železnice, Jičín, Vitiněves, Slatiny, Žeretice, Vysoké Veselí, Smidary, Skřivany, Nový Bydžov, Mlékosrby, Chlumec nad Cidlinou, Olešnice, Žiželice, Choťovice, Žehuň, Dobšice, Sány, Opolany and Libice nad Cidlinou.

==Bodies of water==

The largest body of water on the Cidlina and in its whole basin area is the Žehuňský Pond with an area of . There are 126 bodies of water larger than 1 ha in the basin area.

==Protection of nature==
On the upper reaches of the river there is an extensive nature monument called Javorka a Cidlina – Sběř. It has an area of and, in addition to the Cidlina bed, it also covers the bed of the lower course of the Javorka and some areas on the banks of the Cidlina. The reason for the protection is to ensure a stable population of specially protected species of plants and animals, especially the thick shelled river mussel, the dusky large blue, the Eurasian otter and the green snaketail.

The area of Žehuňský Pond and its surroundings is protected as Žehuňský rybník National Nature Monument. It has an area of . Endangered species found here include the narrow-mouthed whorl snail and several rare species of the genus &quot;Taraxacum&quot; (&quot;bavaricum&quot;, &quot;pauckertianum&quot; and &quot;irrigatum&quot;).

The secondary spring of the Cidlina is located in Jezírko pod Táborem Nature Monument on an area of . It is a small peat pond with a population of the round-leaved sundew.

==Tourism==
The Cidlina is suitable for river tourism. About of the river is navigable. Its calm flow makes it suitable for beginner paddlers.

<text>William Fitz Osbert or William with the long beard (died 1196) was a citizen of London who took up the role of &quot;the advocate of the poor&quot; in a popular uprising in the spring of 1196. Popular revolts by the poor and peasants in England were rare in the 12th century, and quickly and easily suppressed. The fullest known account of the revolt of 1196 comes from the contemporary English historian William of Newburgh in his &quot;Historia rerum anglicarum&quot; from a chapter entitled &quot;Of a conspiracy made in London by one William, and how he paid the penalty of his audacity&quot;.

== The revolt ==
Fitz Osbert was a striking figure who held demagogue-like charismatic power over his followers. He had a long beard and was given the nickname &quot;the Bearded&quot;. He had a University education, had been on the Third Crusade and held a civic office in London. A contemporary remarked &quot;He was of ready wit, moderately skilled in literature, and eloquent beyond measure; and wishing ... to make himself a great name, he began to scheme ... upon the achievement of mighty plans.&quot;

Urban riots were uncommon in 12th and 13th century England with one dramatic exception, that of the events of the spring of 1196. Fitz Osbert had become a champion of the poor of London. He held gatherings with stirring speeches, travelled surrounded by mobs of the poor for protection, and started, according to one source, &quot;a powerful conspiracy, inspired by the zeal of the poor against the insolence of the rich&quot;. He had gathered over 52,000 supporters, and stocks of weapons were cached throughout the city for the purpose of breaking into the houses of the rich citizens of London. He did not, however, overtly oppose the king, Richard I, and went to the king in Normandy to make clear his loyalty.

Nevertheless, Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, decided that Fitz Osbert had to be stopped. He sent two accomplices to capture Fitz Osbert when he was alone and not surrounded by his mob. In the mêlée that followed one of the accomplices was killed and Osbert escaped with a few followers to take refuge in the nearby church of St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside, intending not to seek sanctuary but to defend it as a fortress.

Most of his supporters however, feared to defend the church by force, and Hubert surrounded it with armed men and had it burned down. As Fitz Osbert emerged from the smoke and flames he was stabbed and wounded in the belly by the son of the man whom he had earlier killed, upon which Osbert was taken into custody. Within days he was convicted and &quot;first drawn asunder by horses, and then hanged on a gibbet with nine of his accomplices who refused to desert him&quot;. He was the first person to be executed at Tyburn, which later became the principal site of execution for offenders from London. His followers called him a martyr and the spot where he was hanged became a daily place of gathering; objects associated with his execution were venerated, and even the soil at the spot where he died was collected, resulting in the creation of a pit. Eventually armed guards were put in place to keep people away.

In later centuries such revolts would become more common; in the 12th and 13th centuries English kings were in constant trouble from revolts by the aristocracy, but rarely had trouble from the lower classes.

<doc id="1063933" wikidata="Q668589" url="?curid=1063933" title="Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy">
<text>The Old Swiss Confederacy began as a late medieval alliance between the communities of the valleys in the Central Alps, at the time part of the Holy Roman Empire, to facilitate the management of common interests such as free trade and to ensure the peace along the important trade routes through the mountains. 
The Hohenstaufen emperors had granted these valleys &quot;reichsfrei&quot; status in the early 13th century. As &quot;reichsfrei&quot; regions, the cantons (or regions) of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden were under the direct authority of the emperor without any intermediate liege lords and thus were largely autonomous.

With the rise of the Habsburg dynasty, the kings and dukes of Habsburg sought to extend their influence over this region and to bring it under their rule; as a consequence, a conflict ensued between the Habsburgs and these mountain communities who tried to defend their privileged status as &quot;reichsfrei&quot; regions. The three founding cantons of the &quot;Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft&quot;, as the confederacy was called, were joined in the early 14th century by the city states of Lucerne, Zürich, and Bern, and they managed to defeat Habsburg armies on several occasions. They also profited from the fact that the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, for most of the 14th century, came from the House of Luxembourg and regarded them as potential useful allies against the rival Habsburgs.

By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains. At the end of the 15th century, two wars resulted in an expansion to thirteen cantons (&quot;Dreizehn Orte&quot;): in the Burgundian Wars of the 1470s, the confederates asserted their hegemony on the western border, and their victory in the Swabian War in 1499 against the forces of the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I ensured a &quot;de facto&quot; independence from the empire. During their involvement in the Italian Wars, the Swiss brought the Ticino under their control.

Two similar federations sprang up in neighboring areas in the Alps in the 14th century: in the Grisons, the federation of the Three Leagues (&quot;Drei Bünde&quot;) was founded, and in the Valais, the Seven Tithings (&quot;Sieben Zenden&quot;) were formed as a result of the conflicts with the Dukes of Savoy. Neither federation was part of the medieval &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot; but both maintained very close connections with it.
==Territorial development==

Under the Hohenstaufen dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, the three regions of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden (the or &quot;forest communities&quot;) had gained Imperial immediacy (), the first two because the emperors wanted to place the strategically important St. Gotthard Pass under their direct control, the latter because most of its territory belonged to immediate monasteries. The cities of Bern and Zürich had also become immediate when the dynasty of their patrons, the Zähringer, had died out.

When Rudolph I of Habsburg was elected &quot;King of the Germans&quot; in 1273, he also became the direct liege lord of these regions. He instituted a strict rule and raised the taxes to finance wars and further territorial acquisitions. When he died in 1291, his son Albert I got involved in a power struggle with Adolf of Nassau for the German throne, and the Habsburg rule over the alpine territories weakened temporarily. Anti-Habsburg insurgences sprang up in Swabia and Austria, but were quashed quickly by Albert in 1292. Zürich had participated in this uprising. Albert besieged the city, which had to accept him as its patron.

This time of turmoil prompted the to cooperate more closely, trying to preserve or regain their immediacy. The first alliance started in 1291 when Rudolph bought all the rights over the town of Lucerne and the abbey estates in Unterwalden from Murbach Abbey in Alsace. The saw their trade route over Lake Lucerne cut off and feared losing their independence. When Rudolph died on July 15, 1291, the Communities prepared to defend themselves. On August 1, 1291, an Everlasting League was made between the Forest Communities for mutual defense against a common enemy. Uri and Schwyz got their status reconfirmed by Adolf of Nassau in 1297, but to no avail, for Albert finally won the power struggle and became King of Germany in 1298 after Adolf was killed in the Battle of Göllheim.

===Nucleus===

The Federal Charter of 1291 is one of the oldest surviving written documents of an alliance between Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, the founding cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy. It is possible that it was written a few decades later than the given date of 1291, which would put it in the same date range as the pact of Brunnen of 1315. The traditional date given for the foundation of the Swiss Confederacy in Swiss historiography of the 16th century (Aegidius Tschudi and others) is 1307.

King Rudolf I died in 1291, and 1307 falls into the reign of King Albert I, both members of the House of Habsburg ruling in a time of political instability, when the Holy Roman Empire had been without an emperor for several decades. The politically weak kings of this period had to make frequent concessions to their subjects and vassals in order to remain in power. The founding cantons received confirmations of the establishing their immediate status. Even Unterwalden was finally properly granted this status by Albert&#x27;s successor Henry VII in 1309. This did not prevent the dukes of Habsburg, who originally had had their homelands in the Aargau, from trying to reassert their sovereignty over the territories south of the Rhine.

In the struggle for the crown of the Holy Roman Empire in 1314 between duke Frederick I of Austria and the Bavarian king Louis IV, the sided with Louis for fear of the Habsburgs trying to annex their counties again, like Rudolph I had done. When a long-simmering conflict between Schwyz and the abbey of Einsiedeln escalated once more, the Habsburgs responded by sending a strong army of knights against these peasants to subdue their insurrection, but the Austrian army of Frederick&#x27;s brother Leopold I was utterly defeated in the Battle of Morgarten in 1315. 
The three cantons renewed their alliance in the pact of Brunnen, and Louis IV reconfirmed their Imperial immediacy.
The Swiss chronicles of the Burgundy Wars period (1470s) refer to a rebellion against the local bailiffs, with a coordinated destruction of their forts or castles, known as the (&quot;slighting&quot;) in Swiss historiography. The earliest reference for this is the &quot;White Book of Sarnen&quot; (1470), which records that

The text names Zwing Uri at Amsteg as the first castle slighted, followed by castle Schwandau in Schwyz, Rötzberg in Stans, and finally the castle at Sarnen, the storming of which is told in a graphic manner.

The was long seen as historical, substantiated by the numerous ruined castles in Central Switzerland, but archaeological excavations have shown that these castles were abandoned gradually, not during a sudden uprising, during the period of roughly 1200 to 1350. By the 1970s, the &quot;demythologization&quot; of the foundational period of the Confederacy was at its peak, and the default view was to regard the reports of the late-15th-century chronists as essentially legendary. Since the late 1970s, systematic surveys of medieval castles in Central Switzerland have shown that a number of castles were indeed destroyed during the early 14th century, so that a possible historical nucleus of the accounts may be granted, even though the destruction of these forts in itself was of limited military import and could not have resulted in a lasting political change.

===Expansion to the ===
Subsequently, the three communities (their territories did not yet correspond to the areas of the modern-day cantons) followed a slow policy of expansion. Uri entered a pact with the previously Habsburg valley of Urseren in 1317. In 1332, the city of Lucerne, trying to achieve immediacy from the Habsburgs, joined the alliance. In 1351, these four communities were joined by the city of Zürich, where a strong citizenship had gained power following the installation of the (guild regulations) and the banning of the noble authorities in 1336. The city also sought support against the Habsburg city of Rapperswil, which had tried to overthrow mayor Rudolf Brun in Zürich in 1350. With the help of its new allies, Zürich was able to withstand the siege of duke Albert II of Austria, and the confederates even conquered the city of Zug and the valley of Glarus in 1352. They had to return both Glarus and Zug to the Habsburgs in the peace treaty of Regensburg in 1356; emperor Charles IV in return recognized the guild government of Zürich and confirmed its immediate status in spite of his having forbidden any confederations within the empire in his Golden Bull issued in January of that same year.
The confederacy had signed &quot;perpetual&quot; pacts with both Glarus and Zug in 1352, and thus, even if these pacts apparently were disregarded only a few years later. This date is often considered the entry of these two cantons into the confederation despite their remaining under Habsburg rule for a few more years.

In the west, the had already formed an alliance with the city of Bern in 1323, and even sent a detachment to help the Bernese forces in their territorial expansion against the dukes of Savoy and the Habsburgs in the Battle of Laupen in 1339. In 1353, Bern entered an &quot;eternal&quot; alliance with the confederation, completing the &quot;Confederacy of the Eight Cantons&quot; ().

This alliance of the Eight Cantons was not a homogeneous state but rather a conglomerate of eight independent cities and lands, held together not by one single pact but by a net of six different &quot;eternal&quot; pacts, none of which included all eight parties as signatories. Only the three Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden were part of all these treaties. All eight parties would still pursue their own particular interests, most notably in the cases of the strong cities of Zürich and Bern. Zürich was also part of an alliance of cities around Lake Constance which also included Konstanz, Lindau and Schaffhausen and for some time included cities as far away as Rottweil or Ulm, and Bern followed its own hegemonial politics, participating successively in various alliances with other cities including Fribourg, Murten, Biel or Solothurn. This Bernese &quot;Burgundian Confederation&quot; was a more volatile construct of varying alliances, and in the Battle of Laupen (1339), Fribourg even sided against Bern. Bern&#x27;s position after that battle was strong enough that such alliances often ended with the other party becoming a Bernese dependency, as happened with e.g. Burgdorf or Payerne.

An external threat during this time arose in the form of the Guglers, marauding mercenary knights from France who were beaten back under the leadership of Bern in December 1375.

===Consolidation===
In 1364, Schwyz reconquered the city and land of Zug and renewed the alliance the following year. In the 1380s, Lucerne expanded its territory aggressively, conquering Wolhusen, claiming sovereignty over the valley of the Entlebuch and the formerly Habsburg city of Sempach. As a consequence, Leopold III of Austria assembled an army and met the confederate army near Sempach in 1386, where his troops were defeated decisively in the Battle of Sempach and he himself was killed. In the wake of these events Glarus declared itself free and constituted its first regional diet () in 1387. In the Battle of Näfels in 1388, an Austrian army of Albert III, the successor of Leopold, was defeated, and in the peace treaty concluded the next year, Glarus maintained its independence from the Habsburgs.

The loose federation of states was reinforced by additional agreements amongst the partners. In the of 1370, the signatory six states (without Bern and Glarus) for the first time expressed themselves as a territorial unity, referring to themselves as (&quot;our confederacy&quot;). They assumed in this document authority over clericals, subjecting them to their worldly legislation. Furthermore, the forbade feuds and the parties pledged to guarantee the peace on the road from Zürich to the St. Gotthard pass. Another important treaty was the in 1393. Not only was this the first document signed by all of the Eight Cantons (plus the associated Solothurn), but it also defined that none of them was to unilaterally start a war without the consent of all the others.

Beginning in 1401, the confederates supported the insurrection of Appenzell against the abbey of St. Gallen and Frederick IV of Austria, duke in Tyrol and Vorderösterreich. Appenzell became a protectorate of the Eight Cantons in 1411, which concluded a 50-year peace with Frederick IV in 1412.

Emperor Sigismund placed the imperial ban on Frederick IV in 1415, who had sided with Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, and encouraged others to take over the duke&#x27;s possessions, amongst which was the Aargau. After being granted far-reaching privileges by the emperor (all eight cantons became immediate) and a decree that placed the ban over the peace treaty of 1412, the confederates conquered the Aargau. A large part became Bernese, while the County of Baden was subsequently administered by the confederation as a common property until 1798. Only the Fricktal remained a Habsburg possession.
In the Valais, the conflict between the Bishop of Sion and the Duchy of Savoy, which had led to a separation in 1301 (the bishop controlling the upper Valais and the Savoyards the lower part), broke out again. Twice the Savoyards temporarily occupied the whole Valais, but both times they were ultimately defeated. Both peace treaties from 1361 and 1391 restored the &quot;status quo&quot; of 1301. As a result of these struggles, the villages in the upper Valais organized themselves in the (&quot;seven tenths&quot;) around 1355, emerging after these wars as largely independent small states, much like the cantons of the Confederacy.

In the Grisons, then called Churwalchen, the bishop of Chur and numerous local noble families competed for the control of the region with its many alpine passes. Throughout the 14th century, three leagues of free communities appeared. The (&quot;League of the House of God&quot;), covering the area around Chur and the Engadin, was founded when in 1367 the bishop, Jean de Vienne, planned to hand over the administration of his diocese to the Austrian Habsburgs. It bought its freedom by paying the bishop&#x27;s debt and in the following decades increased its control over the secular administration of the prince-bishopric, until the bishop&#x27;s regent was deposed in 1452. In the upper valley of the Rhine, the (&quot;Gray League&quot;) was founded in 1395 under the direction of the abbot of Disentis and including not only the peasant communities but also the local nobles to end the permanent feuds of the latter. By 1424 the Gray League was dominated by the free communities and gave itself a more democratic charter. The third league, the League of the Ten Jurisdictions (), would not be formed until later.

===Internal crisis===
The relationships between the individual cantons of the confederation were not without tensions, though. A first clash between Bern and the four over the Raron conflict (Bern supported the barons of Raron, while the forest cantons sided with the ) in the upper Valais was barely avoided. The local noble barons of Raron established themselves as the leading family in the upper Valais in the late 14th century and competed with the bishop of Sion for the control of the valley. When emperor Sigismund designated them counts in 1413 and ordered the bishop to hand over his territories to the von Raron, a revolt broke out in 1414. The following year, both rulers had lost: the von Raron had not succeeded in ousting the bishop, who in turn had to concede far-reaching rights to the in the treaty of Seta in 1415.

The Old Zürich War, which began as a dispute over the succession to the count of Toggenburg, was a more serious test of the unity of the Eight Cantons. Zürich did not accept the claims of Schwyz and Glarus, which were supported by the rest of the cantons, and in 1438 declared an embargo. The other members of the confederation expelled Zürich from the confederation in 1440 and declared war. In retaliation Zürich made a pact with the Habsburgs in 1442. The other cantons invaded the canton of Zürich and besieged the city, but were unable to capture it. By 1446, both sides were exhausted, and a preliminary peace was concluded. In 1450, the parties made a definitive peace and Zürich was admitted into the confederation again, but had to dissolve its alliance with the Habsburgs. The confederation had grown into a political alliance so close that it no longer tolerated separatist tendencies of its members.

The end of the dynasty of the counts of Toggenburg in 1436 also had effects on the Grisons. In their former territories in the Prättigau and Davos, the (initially eleven, after a merger only ten) villages founded the League of the Ten Jurisdictions (). By 1471, the three leagues, together with the city of Chur, had formed a close federation, based on military assistance and free trade pacts between the partners and including a common federal diet: the Three Leagues () was born, even though the alliance would be officially concluded in a written contract only in 1524.

===Further expansion===

In the second half of the 15th century, the confederation expanded its territory further. In the north, the formerly Habsburg cities of Schaffhausen and Stein am Rhein had become immediate in 1415, with the ban of Frederick IV. The two strategically important cities—they offered the only two fortified bridges over the river Rhine between Constance and Basel—not only struggled with the robber barons from the neighbouring Hegau region but also were under pressure from the Habsburg dukes, who sought to re-integrate the cities into their domain. On June 1, 1454, Schaffhausen became an associate () of the confederacy by entering an alliance with six of the eight cantons (Uri and Unterwalden did not participate). With the help of the confederates, a Habsburg army of about 2,000 men was warded off east of Thayngen. Stein am Rhein concluded a similar alliance on 6 December 1459.

The city of St. Gallen had also become free in 1415, but was in a conflict with its abbot, who tried to bring it under his influence. But as the Habsburg dukes were unable to support him in any way, he was forced to seek help from the confederates, and the abbey became a protectorate of the confederacy on 17 August 1451. The city was accepted as an associate state on 13 June 1454. Fribourg, another Habsburg city, came under the rule of the Duke of Savoy during the 1440s and had to accept the duke as its lord in 1452. Nevertheless, it also entered an alliance with Bern in 1454, becoming an associate state, too. Two other cities also sought help from the confederates against the Habsburgs: Rottweil became an associate on 18 June 1463, and Mülhausen on 17 June 1466, through an alliance with Bern (and Solothurn). In Rapperswil, a Habsburg enclave on Lake Zürich within confederate territory, a pro-confederate coup d&#x27;état in 1458 led to the city becoming a protectorate of the confederacy in 1464.

Duke Sigismund of Austria got involved in a power struggle with Pope Pius II over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol in 1460. When the duke was excommunicated by the pope, a situation similar to that of 1415 arose. The confederates took advantage of the problems of the Habsburgs and conquered the Habsburg Thurgau and the region of Sargans in the autumn of 1460, which became both commonly administered property. In a peace treaty from 1 June 1461, the duke had no choice but to accept the new situation.

The Swiss also had an interest in extending their influence south of the Alps to secure the trade route across the St. Gotthard Pass to Milan. Beginning in 1331, they initially exerted their influence through peaceful trade agreements, but in the 15th century, their involvement turned military. In 1403 the upper Leventina, as the valley south of the pass is called, became a protectorate of Uri. The Swiss and the Duchy of Milan were in conflict over this region throughout much of the 15th century. In 1439, Uri assumed full control of the upper Leventina; the Duchy of Milan gave up its claims there two years later, and so did the chapter of Milan in 1477. Twice the Swiss conquered roughly the whole territory of the modern canton of Ticino and also the Ossola valley. Twice, the Milanese reconquered all these territories except the Leventina. Both times, the Swiss managed, despite their defeats, to negotiate peace treaties that were actually favorable for them.

===Burgundy Wars===

The Burgundian Wars were an involvement of confederate forces in the conflict between the Valois dynasty and the Habsburgs. The aggressive expansionism of the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, brought him in conflict with both the French king Louis XI and emperor Frederick III of the House of Habsburg. His embargo politics against the cities of Basel, Strasbourg and Mulhouse prompted these to turn to Bern for help.
The conflicts culminated in 1474, after duke Sigismund of Austria had concluded a peace agreement with the confederates in Constance (later called the Perpetual Accord, ). The confederates, united with the Alsatian cities and Sigismund in an &quot;anti-burgundian league&quot;, conquered part of the Burgundian Jura (Franche-Comté), and the next year, Bernese forces conquered and ravaged the Vaud, which belonged to the Duchy of Savoy, which in turn was allied with Charles the Bold. The , with the help of Bernese and other confederate forces, drove the Savoyards out of the lower Valais after a victory in the Battle on the Planta in November 1475. In 1476, Charles retaliated and marched to Grandson with his army, but suffered three devastating defeats in a row, first in the Battle of Grandson, then in the Battle of Murten, until he was killed in the Battle of Nancy in 1477, where the confederates fought alongside an army of René II, Duke of Lorraine. There is a proverbial saying in Switzerland summarizing these events as (&quot;[Charles the Bold lost] his goods at Grandson, his boldness at Murten and his blood at Nancy&quot;).

As a result of the Burgundian Wars, the dynasty of the dukes of Burgundy had died out. Bern returned the Vaud to the duchy of Savoy against a ransom of 50,000 guilders in 1476, and sold its claims on the Franche-Comté to Louis XI for 150,000 guilders in 1479. The confederates only kept small territories east of the Jura mountains, especially Grandson and Murten, as common dependencies of Bern and Fribourg. The whole Valais, however, would henceforth be independent, and Bern would reconquer the Vaud in 1536. While the territorial effects of the Burgundian Wars on the confederation were minor, they marked the beginning of the rise of Swiss mercenaries on the battlefields of Europe.

===Swiss mercenaries===

In the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss soldiers had gained a reputation of near invincibility, and their mercenary services became increasingly sought after by the great European political powers of the time.

Shortly after the Burgundy Wars, individual cantons concluded mercenary contracts, so-called &quot;capitulations&quot;, with many parties, including the Pope—the papal Swiss Guard was founded in 1505 and became operational the next year. More contracts were made with France (a Swiss Guard of mercenaries would be destroyed in the storming of the Tuileries Palace in Paris in 1792), the Duchy of Savoy, Austria, and still others. Swiss mercenaries would play an initially important, but later minor, role on European battlefields until well into the 18th century.

Swiss forces soon got involved in the Italian Wars between the Valois and the Habsburgs over the control of northern Italy. When the power of the Duchy of Milan perished in these wars, the Swiss finally managed to bring the whole Ticino under their control. In 1500, they occupied the strategically important fortress of Bellinzona, which the French king Louis XII, who ruled Milan at that time, ceded definitively in 1503. From 1512 on, the confederates fought on the side of Pope Julius II and his Holy League against the French in territories south of the Alps. After initial successes and having conquered large parts of the territory of Milan, they were utterly defeated by a French army in the Battle of Marignano in 1515, which put an end to military territorial interventions of the confederation, mercenary services under the flags of foreign armies excepted. The results of this short intermezzo were the gain of Ticino as a common administrative region of the confederacy and the occupation of the valley of the Adda river (Veltlin, Bormio, and Chiavenna) by the Three Leagues, which would remain a dependency of the Grisons until 1797 with a brief interruption during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Both Fribourg and Solothurn, which had participated in the Burgundy Wars, now wanted to join the confederation, which would have tipped the balance in favour of the city cantons. The rural cantons were thus strongly opposed. In 1477 they marched upon the cities in protest.

At Stans in 1481 the Federal Diet met in order to resolve the issues, but war seemed inevitable. A local hermit, Niklaus von der Flüe, was consulted on the situation. He requested that a message be passed on to the members of the Diet on his behalf. The details of the message have remained unknown to this day, but it did calm tempers and led to the drawing up of the Treaty of Stans (). Fribourg and Solothurn were admitted into the confederation.

After isolated bilateral pacts between the leagues in the Grisons and some cantons of the confederation had already existed since the early 15th century, the federation of the Three Leagues as a whole became an associate state of the confederation, in 1498, by concluding alliance agreements with the seven easternmost cantons.

When the confederates refused to accept the resolutions of the Diet of Worms in 1495, the Swabian War (also called the Swiss War in Germany) broke out in 1499, opposing the confederation against the Swabian League and emperor Maximilian I. After some battles around Schaffhausen, in the Austrian Vorarlberg and in the Grisons, where the confederates were victorious more often than not, the Battle of Dornach, where the emperor&#x27;s commander was killed, put an end to the war. In September 1499, a peace agreement was concluded at Basel that effectively established a &quot;de facto&quot; independence of the confederation from the empire, although it continued nominally to be part of the Holy Roman Empire until after the Thirty Years&#x27; War and was not included into the system of imperial circles in 1500.

As a direct consequence of the Swabian War the previously associated city states of Basel and Schaffhausen joined the confederation in 1501. In 1513, the Appenzell followed suit as the thirteenth member. The cities of St. Gallen, Biel, Mulhouse and Rottweil as well as the Three Leagues in the Grisons were all associates of the confederation (); the Valais would become an associate state in 1529.

===Annexation of the Ticino and the Veltlin===
The Ticino region consisted of several city-states along the Ticino river. Following the conquest of the region, it was divided into four &#x27;Ticino Bailiwicks&#x27; which were under the joint administration of the Thirteen Cantons after 1512. The four bailiwicks were Valle di Maggia ( or ), Locarno (), Lugano () and Mendrisio (). The area also included several other territories that were owned by one or more cantons. These included: the Bailiwick of Bellinzona (), Blenio () and Riviera () which were owned by Uri, Schwyz, and Nidwalden as well as the bailiwick Leventina () (owned by Uri) and even the Val d&#x27;Ossola (). There were also three Italian-speaking subject areas of the Three Leagues (Bormio, Valtellina and Chiavenna) which were not included in the Ticino Bailiwicks.

Between 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were annexed by forces from Uri, but subsequently lost after the Battle of Arbedo in 1422. While the Battle of Arbedo stopped Swiss expansion for a time, the Confederation continued to exercise influence in the area. The Canton of Uri conquered the Leventina Valley in 1440. In a second conquest Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden gained the town of Bellinzona and the Riviera in 1500. The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation (at that time constituted by 12 cantons). In 1512, Locarno, the Maggia Valley, Lugano and Mendrisio were annexed. Subsequently, the upper valley of the Ticino river, from the St. Gotthard to the town of Biasca (Leventina Valley) was part of the Canton of Uri. The remaining territory (the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains; , ) was administered by the Twelve Cantons. These districts were governed by bailiffs holding office for two years and purchasing it from the members of the League.

Some of the land and the town of Bellinzona were annexed by Uri in 1419 but lost again in 1422. In 1499 nearly one and a half centuries of Milanese rule in Bellinzona ended with the invasion of Milan by Louis XII of France. He captured the city and, fearing an attack by the Swiss, fortified the Castelgrande with 1,000 troops. Throughout the winter of 1499/1500 unrest in Bellinzona grew, until January when an armed revolt of the citizens of Bellinzona drove the French troops from the city. Following the capture and execution of Ludovico Sforza in April 1500 and seeking protection from France, Bellinzona joined the Swiss Confederation on 14 April 1500. Bellinzona would remain under the joint administration of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden until the creation of the Helvetic Republic after the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798.

Between 1433 and 1438 the Duke of Milan, Aloisio Sanseverino, sat as a feudal lord over Lugano. Under the reign of his heirs in the following decades rebellions and riots broke out, which lasted until the French invasion of 1499.

===Myths and legends===

The events told in the saga of William Tell, which are purported to have occurred around 1307, are not substantiated by historical evidence. This story, like the related story of the (the oath on the , a meadow above Lake Lucerne), seems to have its origins in the late 15th century &quot;White Book of Sarnen&quot;, a collection of folk tales from 1470, and is generally considered a fictitious glorification of the independence struggles of the .

The legend of Arnold von Winkelried likewise is first recorded in the 16th century; earlier accounts of the Battle of Sempach do not mention him. Winkelried is said to have opened a breach in the lines of the Austrian footsoldiers by throwing himself into their lances, taking them down with his body such that the confederates could attack through the opening.

==Social developments==
The developments beginning in about the 13th century had profound effects on the society. Gradually the population of serfs changed into one of free peasants and citizens. In the cities—which were small by modern standards; Basel had about 10,000 inhabitants, Zürich, Bern, Lausanne, and Fribourg about 5,000 each—the development was a natural one, for the liege lords very soon gave the cities a certain autonomy, in particular over their internal administration. The number of cities also grew during this period. In 1200 there were about 30 cities. A century later, in 1300, there were over 190 interconnected cities. At the beginning of the 14th century, the artisans in the cities began forming guilds and increasingly took over political control, especially in the cities along the Rhine, e.g. in the Alsace, in Basel, Schaffhausen, Zürich, or Chur. (But not, for instance, in Bern or Lucerne—or, in Germany, Frankfurt—where a stronger aristocracy seems to have inhibited such a development.) The guild cities had a relatively democratic structure, with a city council elected by the citizens.

In the rural areas, people generally had less freedom, but some lords furthered the colonization of remote areas by granting some privileges to the colonists. One well-known colonization movement was that of the Walser from the Valais to the Grisons, colonizing some valleys there in the 14th century. In the mountainous areas, a community management of common fields, alps, and forests (the latter being important as a protection against avalanches) soon developed, and the communes in a valley cooperated closely and began buying out the noble landowners or simply to dispossess them of their lands. Regional diets, the &quot;Landsgemeinden&quot;, were formed to deal with the administration of the commons; it also served as the high court and to elect representatives, the &quot;Landamman&quot;.

As free farmers moved into the mountain valleys, construction and maintenance of the mountain pass roads became possible. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the passes into Graubünden and Valais were expanded and developed, which allowed much of the Walser migration. The Gotthard Pass was first opened around the 12th century, and by 1236 was dedicated to the Bavarian Saint Gotthard of Hildesheim. As the population in the nearby mountain valleys grew, the pass roads continued to expand. With easier and safer roads, as well as increased infrastructure, international trade grew throughout the mountain valleys and Switzerland.
Although both poor and rich citizens or peasants had the same rights (though not the same status), not all people were equal. Immigrants into a village or city had no political rights and were called the &quot;Hintersassen&quot;. In rural areas, they had to pay for their use of the common lands. They were granted equal rights only when they acquired citizenship, which not only was a question of wealth (for they had to buy their citizenship), but they also had to have lived there for some time; especially in the rural areas.

The cities followed an expansionist territorial politics to gain control over the surrounding rural areas, on which they were dependent, using military powers or more often more subtle means such as buying out, or accepting as citizens the subjects (and thereby freeing them: &quot;Stadtluft macht frei&quot;—&quot;city air liberates&quot;) of a liege lord. It was the cities, now, that instituted reeves to manage the administration, but this only sometimes and slowly led to a restriction of the communal autonomy of the villages. The peasants owned their land, the villages kept administering their commons; and the villagers participated in the jury of the city reeve&#x27;s court. They had, however, to provide military service for the city, which on the other hand included the right to own and carry weapons.

Basel became the center of higher education and science in the second half of the 15th century. The city had hosted the Council of Basel from 1431 to 1447, and, in 1460, a university was founded, which eventually would attract many notable thinkers, such as Erasmus or Paracelsus.

===Economy===

The population of the cantons numbered about 600,000 in the 15th century and grew to about 800,000 by the 16th century. The grain production sufficed only in some of the lower regions; most areas were dependent on imports of oats, barley, or wheat. In the Alps, where the yield of grains had always been particularly low due to the climatic conditions, a transition from farming to the production of cheese and butter from cow milk occurred. As the roads got better and safer, a lively trade with the cities developed.

The cities were the marketplaces and important trading centers, being located on the major roads through the Alps. Textile manufacture, where St. Gallen was the leading center, developed. Cheese (esp. Emmentaler and Gruyère) also was a major export item. The exports of the Swiss cities went far, into the Levant or to Poland.

In the late 15th century, the mercenary services became also an important economic factor. The &quot;Reisläuferei&quot;, as the mercenary service was called, attracted many young adventurous Swiss who saw in it a way to escape the relative poverty of their homes. Not only the mercenaries themselves were paid, but also their home cantons, and the &quot;Reisläuferei&quot;, while being heavily criticized already at that time as a heavy drain on the human resources of the confederation, became popular in particular among the young peasants from the rural cantons.

===Political organization===
Initially, the &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot; was not united by one single pact, but rather by a whole set of overlapping pacts and separate bilateral treaties between various members, with only minimum liabilities. The parties generally agreed to preserve the peace in their territories, help each other in military endeavours, and defined some arbitration in case of disputes. The &quot;Sempacherbrief&quot; from 1393 was the first treaty uniting all eight cantons, and subsequently, a kind of federal diet, the &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; developed in the 15th century. The second unifying treaty later became the &quot;Stanser Verkommnis&quot; in 1481.

The &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; typically met several times a year. Each canton delegated two representatives; typically this also included the associate states. Initially, the canton where the delegates met chaired the gathering, but in the 16th century, Zürich permanently assumed the chair (&quot;Vorort&quot;), and Baden became the sessional seat.

The &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; dealt with all inter-cantonal affairs and also served as the final arbitral court to settle disputes between member states, or to decide on sanctions against dissenting members, as happened in the Old Zürich War. It also organized and oversaw the administration of the commons such as the County of Baden and the neighbouring Freiamt, the Thurgau, in the Rhine valley between Lake Constance and Chur, or those in the Ticino. The reeves for these commons were delegated for two years, each time by a different canton.

Despite its informal character (there was no formal legal base describing its competencies), the &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; was an important instrument of the eight, later thirteen cantons to decide inter-cantonal matters. It also proved instrumental in the development of a sense of unity among these sometimes highly individual cantons. Slowly, they defined themselves as the &quot;Eidgenossenschaft&quot; and considered themselves less as thirteen separate states with only loose bonds between.

<text>Der Volksstaat (&quot;People&#x27;s State&quot;) was the central organ of the German Social Democratic Workers Party (the Eisenachers). It was published in Leipzig from October 2, 1869 to September 23, 1876. Its predecessor was &quot;Demokratisches Wochenblatt&quot; (&quot;Democratic Weekly&quot;). It was initially published twice a week, and from July 1873 three times a week. It was edited by Wilhelm Liebknecht, with help from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. They also contributed to the newspaper as did many other socialists including Joseph Dietzgen.

Shortly after he became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) in 1875, Karl Kautsky published his first contributions to &quot;Der Volksstaat&quot;.

<doc id="1063946" wikidata="Q1664622" url="?curid=1063946" title="Occurs check">
<text>In computer science, the occurs check is a part of algorithms for syntactic unification. It causes unification of a variable &quot;V&quot; and a structure &quot;S&quot; to fail if &quot;S&quot; contains &quot;V&quot;.

==Application in theorem proving==

In theorem proving, unification without the occurs check can lead to unsound inference. For example, the Prolog goal
formula_1
will succeed, binding &quot;X&quot; to a cyclic structure which has no counterpart in the Herbrand universe.
As another example,
without occurs-check, a resolution proof can be found for the non-theorem
formula_2: the negation of that formula has the conjunctive normal form formula_3, with formula_4 and formula_5 denoting the Skolem function for the first and second existential quantifier, respectively. Without occurs check, the literals formula_6 and formula_7 are unifiable, producing the refuting empty clause.

==Rational tree unification==

Prolog implementations usually omit the occurs check for reasons of efficiency, which can lead to circular data structures and looping. 
By not performing the occurs check, the worst case complexity of unifying a term
formula_8 with term formula_9
is reduced in many cases from
formula_10
to
formula_11;
in the particular, frequent case of variable-term unifications, runtime shrinks to 
formula_12.
Modern implementations, based on Colmerauer&#x27;s Prolog II,


use rational tree unification to avoid looping. However it is difficult to keep the complexity time linear in the presence of cyclic terms. Examples where Colmerauers algorithm becomes quadratic can be readily constructed, but refinement proposals exist.

See image for an example run of the unification algorithm given in Unification (computer science)#A unification algorithm, trying to solve the goal formula_13, however without the &quot;occurs check rule&quot; (named &quot;check&quot; there); applying rule &quot;eliminate&quot; instead leads to a cyclic graph (i.e. an infinite term) in the last step.

==Sound unification==

ISO Prolog implementations have the built-in predicate &quot;unify_with_occurs_check/2&quot; for sound unification but are free to use unsound or even looping algorithms when unification is invoked otherwise, provided the algorithm works correctly for all cases that are &quot;not subject to occurs-check&quot; (NSTO). The built-in &quot;acyclic_term/1&quot; serves to check the finiteness of terms.

Implementations offering sound unification for all unifications are Qu-Prolog and Strawberry Prolog and (optionally, via a runtime flag): XSB, SWI-Prolog, CxProlog, Tau Prolog, Trealla Prolog and Scryer Prolog. A variety
 of optimizations can render sound unification feasible for common cases.

<text>Oakwood is a suburban area of north London, in the London Borough of Enfield. It is situated within the Southgate postal area (London N14) and was, historically, the southernmost area of Enfield Chase.

==Local history==
The area derives its name from Oakwood Park, which Southgate Council purchased in 1927 and opened to the public. Oakwood Park was named after Oak Lodge, which stood in the grounds between the late 19th century and First World War. 

The arrival in Oakwood of the Piccadilly line extension of the London Underground in 1933 resulted in the construction of the grade II* listed Oakwood tube station and heralded the start of a building boom. Builders George Reed and Laing bought up much of the land for development and estates began to eat up the countryside along Bramley Road and towards Cockfosters.

Prior to development, the only major building in the area was South Lodge – one of the four lodges of Enfield Chase. South Lodge was demolished in 1935; West Lodge Park, East Lodge Nursery, and North Lodge Farm are the locations of the other three lodges. South Lodge Drive and South Lodge Crescent are reminders of South Lodge. Boxer&#x27;s Lake Open Space is one remnant of the Chase.

<text>The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) is an intergovernmental organization dedicated to molecular biology research and is supported by 29 member states, two prospect member states, and one associate member state. EMBL was created in 1974 and is funded by public research money from its member states. Research at EMBL is conducted by more than 110 independent research groups and service teams covering the spectrum of molecular biology.

The Laboratory operates from six sites: the main laboratory in Heidelberg (Germany), and sites in Barcelona (Spain), Grenoble (France), Hamburg (Germany), Hinxton (the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), in England), and Rome (Italy). EMBL groups and laboratories perform basic research in molecular biology and molecular medicine as well as train scientists, students, and visitors. The organization aids in the development of services, new instruments and methods, and technology in its member states. Israel is the only full member state located outside Europe.

== History ==
EMBL was the idea of Leó Szilárd, James Watson and John Kendrew. Their goal was to create an international research centre, similar to CERN, to rival the strongly American-dominated field of molecular biology. Kendrew served as the first Director general of EMBL until 1982 and was succeeded by Lennart Philipson. From 1993 to 2005, Fotis Kafatos, served as director and was succeeded by Iain Mattaj, EMBL&#x27;s fourth director, from 2005 to 2018. In January 2019, Edith Heard became the fifth director of EMBL and the first woman to hold this position.

Heard announced the organisation&#x27;s five-year scientific programme Molecules to Ecosystems on 19 January 2022.

== Research ==
Each EMBL site has a specific research field. The EMBL-EBI is a hub for bioinformatics research and services, developing and maintaining a large number of scientific databases that are free of charge. At Grenoble and Hamburg, research is focused on structural biology.

The EMBL Rome site is dedicated to the study of epigenetics and neurobiology. Scientists at EMBL Barcelona are exploring how tissues and organs function and develop, in health and disease. At the headquarters in Heidelberg, there are units in cell biology and biophysics, developmental biology, genome biology, and structural and computational biology, as well as service groups complementing the aforementioned research fields.

Many scientific breakthroughs have been made at EMBL. The first systematic genetic analysis of embryonic development in the fruit fly was conducted at EMBL by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1995. In the early 1980s, Jacques Dubochet and his team at EMBL developed cryogenic electron microscopy for biological structures. They were rewarded with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

== Scientific Services ==
EMBL has identified as a core mission the provision of advanced experimental and data services to external researchers, including structural biology, imaging and sequencing facilities at its five European sites. In 2021, EMBL completed a new centre for high-resolution light and electron microscopy at its Heidelberg Headquarters – the EMBL Imaging Centre. The centre is open to visiting scientists worldwide and provides a unique service facility for the life sciences by combining the latest imaging technologies with expert advice and industry-led developments not yet otherwise available.

== Training ==
Advanced training is one of EMBL&#x27;s five core missions. Over the years, the Laboratory has established a number of training activities, of which the EMBL International PhD Programme (EIPP) is the flagship – it has a student body of about 200, and since 1997 has had the right to award its own degree, although currently students receive their degrees from partner universities. Other activities include the postdoctoral programme, including the EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral programme (EIPOD) and the Visitor Programme.

== EMBL Advanced Training Centre ==
In March 2010, the EMBL Advanced Training Centre (ATC) was inaugurated on the main campus in Heidelberg. Shaped in the form of a double helix, it hosts scientific conferences, seminars and training courses, and provides access to training laboratories and lecture halls.

The ATC also hosts EMBL&#x27;s European Learning Lab for the Life Sciences (ELLS) which provides training for secondary school teachers on the latest developments in molecular biology, and runs a student outreach program.

== Science and society ==
EMBL also runs an active Science and Society Programme which offers activities and events on current questions in life science research for the general public and the scientific community.

== Membership ==
EMBL is currently supported by 29 member states, one associate member state, and two prospect member states.

<text>First Great Western Link (FGWL) was a train operating company in England owned by FirstGroup that operated the Thames franchise from April 2004 until March 2006.

==History==
In April 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority invited FirstGroup and Go-Ahead to bid for a two-year extension to the Thames franchise that would coincide with the end date of the First Great Western franchise, after which both would become part of the Greater Western franchise. In November 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the new franchise to First with the services operated by Thames Trains transferring to FGWL on 1 April 2004.

On 12 June 2005 Heathrow Connect was introduced as a joint venture between FGWL and BAA. BAA supplied the Class 360 rolling stock and on-board staff. FGWL received the revenue for journeys between Paddington and Hayes &amp; Harlington, and BAA the revenue for journeys between Hayes &amp; Harlington and Heathrow Airport.

==Services==
FGWL ran services along the Great Western Main Line from London Paddington to Didcot with services continuing to north to Oxford, Bicester Town, Hereford and Stratford-upon-Avon. It also operated services on the Greenford, Windsor &amp; Eton Central, Marlow, Henley and Bedwyn lines and on the Reading to Basingstoke and North Downs lines.

The Stratford-upon-Avon service was transferred to Chiltern Railways in December 2004 with FGWL ceasing to operate beyond Banbury.

==Rolling stock==
FGWL inherited a fleet of Class 165s and 166s from Thames Trains. A franchise commitment was to use five Class 180 &quot;Adelantes&quot; from sister company First Great Western on Cotswold Line services from December 2004, releasing five Class 165s for transfer to Chiltern Railways. Because of the short nature of the franchise and the fact that the Class 165s and 166s had only recently been repainted, the Thames Trains livery of white, blue and green was retained with FGWL branding applied.

==Depot==
FGWL&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Reading TMD.

==Demise==
On 6 November 2002 as part of a franchise reorganisation by the Strategic Rail Authority, it was announced that the Great Western, Thames Trains and Wessex Trains franchises would be combined to form the Greater Western franchise. This was part of a Strategic Rail Authority strategy to reduce the number of train operating companies providing services from a single London terminal. This was expected to improve efficiency and reliability.

In December 2005 the Department for Transport awarded the new Greater Western franchise to First with the services operated by FGWL transferring to First Great Western on 1 April 2006.

<text>Jan Mikulicz-Radecki () was a German-Polish-Austrian surgeon who worked mainly in the German Empire. He was born on 16 May 1850 in Czerniowce in the Austrian Empire (present-day Chernivtsi in Ukraine) and died on 4 June 1905 in Breslau, German Empire (present-day Wrocław in Poland). He was professor in Kraków, Breslau, and Königsberg. He was the inventor of new operating techniques and tools, and is one of the pioneers of antiseptics and aseptic techniques. In Poland he is regarded as one of the founders of the Kraków school of surgery.

==Life==
His parental ancestors of the Mikulicz family were of Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; origin and had been granted the Gozdawa coat of arms by King John III Sobieski after the 1683 Battle of Vienna. His mother Emilie Freiin von Damnitz was of Austrian descent. Mikulicz-Radecki spoke his native German and also Polish, Russian and English fluently. When asked his nationality he simply answered &quot;surgeon&quot;. After finishing studies at the University of Vienna under Theodor Billroth, he was a director of surgery at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, the University of Königsberg (Kaliningrad) and from 1890 at the University of Breslau.

Mikulicz-Radecki&#x27;s innovations in operative technique for a wide variety of diseases helped develop modern surgery. He contributed prodigiously to cancer surgery, especially on organs of the digestive system. He was first to suture a perforated gastric ulcer (1885), surgically restore part of the oesophagus (1886), remove a malignant part of the colon (1903), and describe what is now known as Mikulicz’ disease.

In 1881, he developed improved models of the esophagoscope and gastroscope. As an ardent advocate of antiseptics, he did much to popularize Joseph Lister&#x27;s antiseptic methods. He created a surgical mask and was the first to use medical gloves during surgery.

Mikulicz-Radecki was a talented amateur pianist and a friend of Johannes Brahms.

He received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.

The German ornithologist Maria Koepcke (born Maria Emilie Anna von Mikulicz-Radecki) and her daughter the German mammalogist Juliane Koepcke, are his descendants.

== Preparation ==
Hot spätzle and grated cheese such as Emmentaler or granular cheese are layered alternately and finally topped with fried onions. After adding each layer, the is baked until all the cheese is melted.

Accompanying side dishes are green salads or potato salad. In some parts of Vorarlberg and also Liechtenstein is usually served with apple sauce. Leftovers of käsespätzle can be pan-fried with butter.

== Regional specialities ==

In Tyrol, käsespätzle are prepared with Bergkäse or Emmental cheese, optionally with both. In Vorarlberg two different cheese varieties are dominating, so in Montafon the cooks use Montafon sour cheese and in Bregenz Forest they use Bergkäse and Räßkäse, a local hard cheese.

Side dishes in Vorarlberg are butter and yellowly tarnished onion rings.

Different variations are found with Limburger, Weisslacker or Vorarlberger Bergkäse.

== Variations ==
A variation of is or from Salzburg and Obersteiermark, both parts of Austria and are pan-fried instead. Grated cheese and spätzle, freshly scraped from a board, are mixed together and are heated in a pan.

<text>Times of Lore is a 1988 action role-playing game that was developed and published by Origin Systems for several platforms, including PC, Commodore 64/128, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Amiga.

==Plot==

The game&#x27;s story tells of the kingdom of Albareth whose monarch High King Valwyn has disappeared and the dukes and barons are wrestling for power. Barbarians are threatening to invade, while monsters are pillaging the land. The player must assume the role of one of three heroes, picking between a barbarian, a knight, and a valkyrie; and unravel the conspiracy and find three magic items.

==Gameplay==

The game takes place in a very complex world, featuring 13,000 screens of map according to the promotional material. There is no loading during the game, which was an impressive technical accomplishment for such a massive environment.

The Commodore 64 version features high-res overlays for the sprites, a technique that displays two sprites on top of each other. One is a low resolution multi-colour sprite and the other is a high resolution monochrome sprite. Animated water is also used and the game world slowly changes colour between night and day.

It is possible to end up in unwinnable situations that require restarting the game, such as killing important characters who would otherwise have given certain quests or objects. Killing random peasants is not as dangerous, as staying the night at the inn will make them forget your crimes.

There are many objects that can be found in the game, including a teleportation scroll, healing potions and a returning axe based on Mjolnir. There is the hidden city of Treela, in the middle of the map, behind a forest. Serfs will speak of a dragon in the north, which can be found sleeping in his cave on the eastern edge of the northern mountains. Catacombs also exists, but if entered, the ghouls inside are unleashed upon the world, making the game much more difficult. In the Apple II version, the dragon is replaced with a giant lurking in the northwest portion of the map.

==Development==
&quot;Times of Lore&quot;, developed by Chris Roberts, was originally titled &quot;Ultra Realm&quot;. According to Roberts, it was inspired by console action-adventures, particularly &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Roberts stated that &quot;interfaces and design are being affected&quot; by the video game console market and what &quot;the Japanese market originally demanded were certain constraints which did not affect the depth and quality of a game.&quot;

==Reception==

Scorpia of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; recommended &quot;Times of Lore&quot; as an introductory computer RPG, noting the dialogue and actions were menu-driven, simplifying the game. &quot;Compute!&quot; agreed with the recommendation, noting that the game&#x27;s scale was smaller than the &quot;Ultima&quot; games&#x27; and praising its graphics and sound. The magazine named the game in its list of &quot;nine great games for 1989&quot; as &quot;an excellent introductory-level fantasy role-playing game&quot;.

==Reviews==
*&quot;Jeux &amp; Stratégie&quot; #56

==Legacy==
&quot;Times of Lore&quot; went on to inspire several later titles by Origin Systems. This includes the 1990 title &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, another action RPG based on the same engine. It also inspired the 1990 title &quot;Ultima VI: The False Prophet&quot;, that adopted several elements from &quot;Times of Lore&quot;, including real-time aspects, a constant-scale open world (replacing the unscaled overworld of earlier &quot;Ultima&quot; games), and an icon-based point &amp; click interface. Richard Garriott, in addition to citing it as an influence on &quot;Ultima VI&quot;, said that &quot;Ultima VII: The Black Gate&quot; was also inspired by &quot;Times of Lore&quot;. Some have considered the game as a precursor to &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot;.

<text>OBJ is a programming language family introduced by Joseph Goguen in 1976, and further worked on by Jose Meseguer.

==Overview==
It is a family of declarative &quot;ultra high-level&quot; languages. It features abstract types, generic modules, subsorts (subtypes with multiple inheritance), pattern-matching modulo equations, E-strategies (user control over laziness), module expressions (for combining modules), theories and views (for describing module interfaces) for the massively parallel RRM (rewrite rule machine).
Members of the OBJ family of languages include CafeOBJ, Eqlog, FOOPS, Kumo, Maude, OBJ2, and OBJ3.

==OBJ2==

OBJ2 is a programming language with Clear-like parametrised modules and a functional system based on equations.

==OBJ3==
OBJ3 is a version of OBJ based on order-sorted rewriting. OBJ3 is agent-oriented and runs on Kyoto Common Lisp AKCL.

<doc id="1063983" wikidata="Q383329" url="?curid=1063983" title="Parvicursor">
<text>Parvicursor (meaning &quot;small runner&quot;) is a genus of tiny maniraptoran dinosaur with long slender legs for fast running.

== Discovery and naming ==
The holotype PIN no. 4487/25, mostly consisting of vertebrae, the pelvis and the right hindlimb, was discovered in 1992 and described in 1996. It was discovered in Barun Goyot Formation of Khulsan, Mongolia, dated at approximately 72 million years old. 

== Description ==
At only about from snout to end of tail, and in weight, it was initially seen as one of the smallest non-avian dinosaurs known from an adult specimen. However, in 2022 its holotype was concluded to represent a juvenile individual.
Like other members of the family Alvarezsauridae, the forelimbs of &quot;Parvicursor&quot; were short and stubby, with hands all but completely reduced to a single large claw, possibly useful for opening tough termite mounds or other types of digging. It is unlikely that the claw could have served much for defense, as it was short and not adapted for flexible movements — it is more likely it would do as the animal&#x27;s name implies: &quot;cursor&quot; means &quot;runner&quot;.

Close relatives include &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; and &quot;Mononykus&quot;, and together with these it is classified in the alvarezsaurid subfamily Parvicursorinae.

== Taxonomy ==
There may be a second, yet-unnamed, species of &quot;Parvicursor&quot;. Two specimens of tiny alvarezsaurids were described by Suzuki &quot;et al.&quot; in 2002. These authors considered the specimens to be juvenile &quot;Shuvuuia&quot;, which lived in the same formation. However, a study by Nick Longrich and Phil Currie in 2009 suggested that several characters of the skeleton, including fused wrist and pelvic bones, indicated that these specimens were in fact adults of a tiny alvarezsaurid species. A phylogenetic analysis found that they grouped together with &quot;Parvicursor&quot;, and the authors provisionally referred them to &quot;Parvicursor sp.&quot; pending further study.

It has been suggested that &quot;Linhenykus&quot; and &quot;Ceratonykus&quot; may be junior synonyms of &quot;Parvicursor&quot;.

<text>The Kappa 77 KP-2U Sova, later produced as the Jihlavan KP-2U Skyleader and most recently as the Jihlavan Skyleader, is a two-seat civil utility aircraft designed in the Czech Republic and available in kit form for home building. It is a conventional low-wing monoplane featuring all-metal construction and tricycle undercarriage.

==Design and development==

Jihlavan Aircraft built the Kappa Sova for Kappa 77 from 1997 to 2004 and obtained marketing rights in 2005 when Kappa became insolvent. They became a subsidiary of Skyleader Aircraft in 2008 when the type was redesignated Jihlavan Skyleader. It is an all-metal design apart from a carbon fibre cockpit frame. It has two-spar tapered wings with 6° of dihedral, electrically operated Fowler flaps and upturned Küchemann tips. The fin and rudder are swept. The straight tapered tailplane is set on top of the fuselage, the port elevator carrying a trim tab.

The Bulgarian company ACS started producing the Skyleader 600 at the state owned TEREM-Letets aircraft factory in Sofia in July 2015 under a licence agreement.

The original Sova/Skyleader 150 has staggered side-by-side configuration seating with the starboard seat 200 mm (8 in) aft of the other, but a widened fuselage allows the Skyleader 200 to have true side-by-side seating. The earlier version has a forward-hinged canopy with fixed rear transparencies; the Skyleader 200 has a single-piece canopy. Both these variants normally have an electrically actuated tricycle undercarriage with a steerable nosewheel, though a fixed version is an option and is standard on the later Skyleader 500 and 600 variants. The standard engine for the 150/200 variants is a 60 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912UL, though the more powerful Rotax 912ULS or Rotax 914 can be fitted, all driving a choice of two-blade propellers. The 500/600 variants can also use the Rotax 912 UL or Rotax 912S; the Jabiru 2200 or 3300 engines may also be fitted. The Skyleader 500/600 variants have three-blade propellers.

The Kappa 77 KP-2U Sova first flew on 26 May 1996 and the KP-5 Rapid 500 (later the Skyleader 500) in December 2003. Czech certification was achieved in September 1997 and March 2004 respectively. The Skyleader is produced in both kit and flyaway form.

Airplanes Africa Limited a Czech manufacturer set up a plant in Tanzania to assemble the Skyleader 600. The Morogoro plant assembled Tanzania’s first aircraft in October 2023.

==Operational history==
Over 210 had been sold by November 2010. 145 Sovas and 12 Skyleaders appear on the civil registers of European countries, Russia excepted, in mid-2010.

==Variants (Jihlavan)==

&quot;Data from&quot; Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft 2011/12
;Skyleader 100
:Single-seat variant, with optional rectangular or trapezoidal wing planform and powered by a Rotax 582 two-stroke engine. Was expected to be marketed starting in 2011 as a kit or complete aircraft.
;KP-2U Skyleader 150
:Originally called the Kappa 77 KP-2U Sova. Staggered side-by-side seating.
;KP-2 Skyleader 200
:Introduced 1996, with widened cockpit to for more elbow room with side-by-side seating. It features retractable landing gear.
;Rapid 200FC: One-off hydrogen-powered via fuel cell and electric motor Skyleader 150 conversion, first flight 20 May 2010.
;KP-5 Skyleader 500: S-LSA version, originally the KP-5 Rapid 500. FAA approved July 2005.
;Skyleader 400
:Light-sport aircraft version with a gull-winged canopy and re-designed engine cowling, introduced as a &quot;mid-line model&quot;. The 400 is also available a purely electric aircraft, powered by an 80 kW electric motor and 145 amp-hour battery pack.
;Skyleader 600
:Light sport model introduced at AERO Friedrichshafen in 2010. It features a wider cockpit, revised wingtips and greater fuel capacity. Engines available include the Rotax 912UL, the Rotax 912ULS and the turbocharged Rotax 914 four-stroke powerplants.

==Accidents and incidents==
In May 2016 a Skyleader 500 crashed in Rhoadesville, Virginia, United States, killing the two occupants of the aircraft. The Galaxy Rescue Systems ballistic parachute had been deployed, but the single front riser failed, leading to the parachute failure. The aircraft had been practicing slow flight and stalls and most likely entered a spin, from which the parachute was deployed. The aircraft was over maximum weight at the time of the accident. The GRS parachute model had never been tested in the air on this aircraft design and had only been ground tested once. A new double front riser system is now in use.

<doc id="1064008" wikidata="Q134179" url="?curid=1064008" title="Alvarezsauridae">
<text>Alvarezsauridae is a family of small, long-legged dinosaurs. Although originally thought to represent the earliest known flightless birds, they are now thought to be an early diverging branch of maniraptoran theropods. Alvarezsaurids were highly specialized. They had tiny but stout forelimbs, with compact, bird-like hands. Their skeletons suggest that they had massive breast and arm muscles, possibly adapted for digging or tearing. They had long, tube-shaped snouts filled with tiny teeth. They have been interpreted as myrmecophagous, adapted to prey on colonial insects such as termites, with the short arms acting as effective digging instruments to break into nests. 

&quot;Alvarezsaurus&quot;, the type genus of the family, was named for the historian Gregorio Álvarez.

==History of study==
Bonaparte (1991) described the first alvarezsaurid, &quot;Alvarezsaurus calvoi&quot;, from an incomplete skeleton found in Patagonia, Argentina. Bonaparte also named a family, Alvarezsauridae, to contain it. He argued that &quot;Alvarezsaurus&quot; might be most closely related to the ornithomimosaurs.

In 1993, Perle &quot;et al.&quot; described the next alvarezsaur to be discovered, naming it &quot;Mononychus olecranus&quot; (meaning &quot;one claw&quot;). A month later they changed the genus name to &quot;Mononykus&quot;, because the earlier spelling was already the genus name of an extant beetle. Perle &quot;et al.&quot; mistakenly described &quot;Mononykus&quot; as a member of Avialae, one more advanced than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. They argued that the family Alvarezsauridae was actually a group of Mesozoic flightless birds on the basis of several features that were supposedly unique to birds.

In 1996, Novas described another member of the group called &quot;Patagonykus puertai&quot;. Karhu and Rautian (1996) described a Mongolian member of the family; &quot;Parvicursor remotus&quot;. Chiappe &quot;et al.&quot;(1998) described another Mongolian member, &quot;Shuvuuia deserti&quot;, and found it to be a bird as in Perle et al.&#x27;s analysis.
These mistaken assignments of alvarezsaurids to birds were caused primarily by features that are strikingly, or even uniquely, avian. The sternum, for example, is elongated and deeply keeled for an enlarged pectoralis muscle, as it is in neognathous birds and volant ratites. One bone in the skull of &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; appeared to be an ectethmoid fused to a prefrontal. The ectethmoid is an ossification known only in Neornithes. Other birdlike characters included the palatine, foramen magnum, cervical and caudal vertebrae, and many others.

Several researchers disagreed with Perle &quot;et al.&quot; (1993) and Chiappe &quot;et al.&quot; (1998), Feduccia (1994), Ostrom (1994), Wellnhofer (1994), Kurochkin (1995), Zhou (1995), and Sereno (1997) considered it unlikely that alvarezsaurids were members of Avialae. Martin (1997) performed a cladistic analysis but Sereno criticized it strongly, finding it flawed by incorrect codings, use of only select data, and results that did not support his conclusions. Sereno (1999) performed a new analysis, revising the anatomical interpretations and clarifying the characters. He found that alvarezsaurids were more parsimoniously related to the Ornithomimosauria.

As the more primitive members of the Alvarezsauridae were better characterized, the monophyly of the clade was strongly supported, but the more primitive members lacked the most birdlike traits. Some of these traits had been misinterpreted, also. The remaining similarities between birds and alvarezsaurs, like the keeled sterna, are another case of homoplasy; where the derived alvarezsaurids developed birdlike characters through convergent evolution, rather than inheriting them from a common ancestor with birds.

==Description==

Alvarezsaurids ranged from to in length, although some possible members may have been larger, including the European &quot;Heptasteornis&quot; that may have reached long. Fossils attributed to alvarezsaurids have also been found in North and South America and Asia, and range in age from about 86 to 66 million years ago.

===Feathers===
At least one specimen of alvarezsaurid, from the species &quot;Shuvuuia deserti&quot;, preserved down-like, feathery, integumental structures covering the fossil. Schweitzer &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) subjected these filaments to microscopic, morphological, mass spectrometric, and immunohistochemical studies and found that they consisted of beta-keratin, which is the primary protein in feathers.

==Lifestyle==
The lifestyle of alvarezsaurids has been debated since the nature of these dinosaurs was established. It has been suggested by numerous palaeontologists that they used their claws to break into ant and termite colonies, though the arm anatomy of an alvarezsaurid would require the animal to lie on its chest against a termite nest. It is also possible that the alvarezsaurids filled some ecological niche that has not yet been considered. Studies of the tails in various alvarezsaur genera also suggest they were possessed of an incredible ability to change their rotational inertia, and combined with their forelimbs, this suggests their ecological niches were similar to those of aardvarks, pangolins, and anteaters.

Additionally, it is known that alvarezsaurids, with their long legs, appear to be built for speed. What implications this has on possible lifestyle is unknown. The discovery of &quot;Qiupanykus&quot; in association with oviraptorid eggs, indicates that the advanced alvarezsaurids may also have been specialists in nest raiding, using their robust thumb claws to crack open eggshells.

==Classification== 

Turner &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) place the alvarezsaurs as the most basal group in the Maniraptora, one step more derived than &quot;Ornitholestes&quot; and two more derived than the Ornithomimosauria. The alvarezsaurs are more primitive than the Oviraptorosauria.

Novas&#x27; 1996 description of &quot;Patagonykus&quot;, demonstrated that it was a link between the more primitive (basal) &quot;Alvarezsaurus&quot; and the more advanced (derived) &quot;Mononykus&quot;, and reinforced their monophyly. &quot;Parvicursor&quot; was discovered shortly after, and placed in its own family Parvicursoridae, and then &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; in 1998. Everything has since been lumped into Alvarezsauridae, with Mononykinae surviving as a subfamily.

There may be a relationship between the alvarezsaurids and the Ornithomimosauria as sister clades within either Thomas Holtz&#x27;s Arctometatarsalia or Paul Sereno&#x27;s Ornithomimiformes. The discovery of &quot;Haplocheirus&quot;, which exhibits transitional features between the more derived alvarezsaurs and other maniraptorans, particularly in relation to the skull structure and development of the hand, has provided further support for that relationship.

The taxonomy of the alvarezsaurs has been somewhat confused, due to different authors using different names for groups with the same definition. The family Alvarezsauridae was first coined by Jose Bonaparte in 1991, but given no specific phylogenetic definition. Novas later defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Alvarezsaurus&quot; and &quot;Mononykus&quot; plus all its descendants, though others, such as Paul Sereno, used a more inclusive definition, such as all dinosaurs closer to &quot;Shuvuuia&quot; than to modern birds. In 2009, Livezey and Zusi used the name Alvarezsauroidea for the total group of all alvarezsaurs, restricting the name Alvarezsauridae to the clade defined by &quot;Alvarezsaurus&quot; + &quot;Mononykus&quot;. This was followed by Choiniere and colleagues in 2010, who described the first non-alvarezsaurid alvarezsauroid, &quot;Haplocheirus&quot;. Some authors have used the name Mononykinae for the sub-group of alvarezsaurs including the advanced Mongolian species. However, Choiniere and colleagues argued that Parvicursorinae has priority, since its coordinate name under the ICZN Code, Parvicursoridae, was named earlier. Another subfamily, Patagonykinae, has been named to include the South American &quot;Patagonykus&quot; and &quot;Bonapartenykus&quot;, but a few recent studies have placed them just outside Alvarezsauridae, some of which do not even recover them in a single clade, making Patagonykinae turn out to be paraphyletic.

The cladogram below is the latest and most comprehensive analysis of alvarezsaurid evolution, following Meso et al. (2024).

<doc id="1064009" wikidata="Q656705" url="?curid=1064009" title="Object Data Management Group">
<text>The Object Data Management Group (ODMG) was conceived in the summer of 1991 at a breakfast with object database vendors that was organized by Rick Cattell of Sun Microsystems. In 1998, the ODMG changed its name from the Object Database Management Group to reflect the expansion of its efforts to include specifications for both object database and object–relational mapping products.

The primary goal of the ODMG was to put forward a set of specifications that allowed a developer to write portable applications for object database and object–relational mapping products. In order to do that, the data schema, programming language bindings, and data manipulation and query languages needed to be portable.

Between 1993 and 2001, the ODMG published five revisions to its specification. The last revision was ODMG version 3.0, after which the group disbanded.

== Major components of the ODMG 3.0 specification==
*&quot;Object Model.&quot; This was based on the Object Management Group&#x27;s Object Model. The OMG core model was designed to be a common denominator for object request brokers, object database systems, object programming languages, etc. The ODMG designed a profile by adding components to the OMG core object model.
*&quot;Object Specification Languages.&quot; The ODMG Object Definition Language (ODL) was used to define the object types that conform to the ODMG Object Model. The ODMG Object Interchange Format (OIF) was used to dump and load the current state to or from a file or set of files.
*&quot;Object Query Language (OQL).&quot; The ODMG OQL was a declarative (nonprocedural) language for query and updating. It used SQL as a basis, where possible, though OQL supports more powerful object-oriented capabilities.
*&quot;C++ Language Binding.&quot; This defined a C++ binding of the ODMG ODL and a C++ Object Manipulation Language (OML). The C++ ODL was expressed as a library that provides classes and functions to implement the concepts defined in the ODMG Object Model. The C++ OML syntax and semantics are those of standard C++ in the context of the standard class library. The C++ binding also provided a mechanism to invoke OQL.
*&quot;Smalltalk Language Binding.&quot; This defined the mapping between the ODMG ODL and Smalltalk, which was based on the OMG Smalltalk binding for the OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL). The Smalltalk binding also provided a mechanism to invoke OQL.
*&quot;Java Language Binding.&quot; This defined the binding between the ODMG ODL and the Java programming language as defined by the Java 2 Platform. The Java binding also provided a mechanism to invoke OQL.

== Status ==
ODMG 3.0 was published in book form in 2000. By 2001, most of the major object database and object-relational mapping vendors claimed conformance to the ODMG Java Language Binding. Compliance to the other components of the specification was mixed. In 2001, the ODMG Java Language Binding was submitted to the Java Community Process as a basis for the Java Data Objects specification. The ODMG member companies then decided to concentrate their efforts on the Java Data Objects specification. As a result, the ODMG disbanded in 2001.

In 2004, the Object Management Group (OMG) was granted the right to revise the ODMG 3.0 specification as an OMG specification by the copyright holder, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. In February 2006, the OMG announced the formation of the Object Database Technology Working Group (ODBT WG) and plans to work on the 4th generation of an object database standard.

<text>In computing, object identifiers or OIDs are an identifier mechanism standardized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and ISO/IEC for naming any object, concept, or &quot;thing&quot; with a globally unambiguous persistent name.

==Syntax and lexicon==
An OID corresponds to a node in the &quot;OID tree&quot; or hierarchy, which is formally defined using the ITU&#x27;s OID standard, X.660. The root of the tree contains the following three arcs:

* 0: ITU-T
* 1: ISO
* 2: joint-iso-itu-t

Each node in the tree is represented by a series of integers separated by periods, corresponding to the path from the root through the series of ancestor nodes, to the node. Thus, an OID denoting Intel Corporation appears as follows,

:codice_1

and corresponds to the following path through the OID tree:
* 1 ISO
* 1.3 identified-organization (ISO/IEC 6523), 
* 1.3.6 DoD, 
* 1.3.6.1 internet, 
* 1.3.6.1.4 private,
* 1.3.6.1.4.1 IANA enterprise numbers, 
* 1.3.6.1.4.1.343 Intel Corporation

A textual representation of the OID paths is also commonly seen; for example, 
* iso.identified-organization.dod.internet.private.enterprise.intel

Each node in the tree is controlled by an assigning authority, which may define child nodes under the node and delegate assigning authority for the child nodes. Continuing with the example, the node numbers under root node &quot;1&quot; are assigned by ISO; the nodes under &quot;1.3.6&quot; are assigned by the US Department of Defense; the nodes under &quot;1.3.6.1.4.1&quot; are assigned by IANA; the nodes under &quot;1.3.6.1.4.1.343&quot; are assigned by Intel Corporation, and so forth.

==Usage==
* ISO/IEC 6523 &quot;International Code Designator&quot; uses OIDs with the prefix &quot;1.3&quot;.
* In computer security, OIDs serve to name almost every object type in X.509 certificates, such as components of Distinguished Names, CPSs, etc.
* Within X.500 and LDAP schemas and protocols, OIDs uniquely name each attribute type and object class, and other elements of schema.
* In Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), each node in a management information base (MIB) is identified by an OID.
* IANA assigns Private Enterprise Numbers (PEN) to companies and other organizations under the 1.3.6.1.4.1 node. OIDs down-tree from these are among the most commonly seen; for example, within SNMP MIBs, as LDAP attributes, and as vendor suboptions in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
* In the United States, Health Level Seven (HL7), a standards-developing organization in the area of electronic health care data exchange, is the assigning authority at the 2.16.840.1.113883 (joint-iso-itu-t.country.us.organization.hl7) node. HL7 maintains its own OID registry, and as of December 1, 2020 it contained almost 20,000 nodes, most of them under the HL7 root. 
* DICOM uses OIDs.
* The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses OIDs to manage the many complex values sets or &quot;vocabularies&quot; used in the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (VADS).

<doc id="1064017" wikidata="Q1766333" url="?curid=1064017" title="Passiflora foetida">
<text>Passiflora foetida (common names: stinking passionflower, wild maracuja, bush passion fruit, wild water lemon, stoneflower, love-in-a-mist, or running pop) is a species of passion flower that is native to the southwestern United States (southern Texas and Arizona), Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and much of South America. It has been introduced to tropical regions around the world, such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, Hawaii, Africa, and The Maldives. It is a creeping vine like other members of the genus, and yields an edible fruit. The specific epithet, &quot;foetida&quot;, means &quot;stinking&quot; in Latin and refers to the strong aroma emitted by damaged foliage.

This passion flower tolerates arid ground, but favours moist areas. It is known to be an invasive species in some areas. This plant is also a widely grown perennial climber, and has been used in traditional medicine.

==Description==
The stems are thin and wiry, and are covered with minute sticky yellow hairs. Older stems become woody. The leaves are three- to five-lobed and viscid-hairy. When crushed, these leaves give off a pungent odor that some people consider unpleasant. The flowers are white to pale cream coloured, or pink to pale purple, about 5–6 cm diameter. The ripe fruit is globose, 2–3 cm diameter, remains green at maturity and has numerous black seeds embedded in the pulp; the fruit are eaten and the seeds dispersed by birds. Red-fruited plants have been classified as distinct species.
&quot;Passiflora foetida&quot; is able to trap insects on its bracts, which exude a sticky substance that also contains digestive enzymes. This minimizes predation on young flowers and fruits. Whether or not it gains nourishment from its prey is uncertain, and it is considered a protocarnivorous plant.

==Animal interactions==
&quot;Passiflora foetida&quot; is a larval host and nectar source for the Gulf fritillary (&quot;Agraulis vanillae&quot;).

&quot;Passiflora foetida&quot; has been mentioned as a toxic plant by farmers from northeastern Brazil. An experiment done with goats led to the discovery that high levels of cyanide in &quot;P. foetida&quot; cause poisoning after the ingestion of fresh leaves, mostly during the dry season.

==Uses==
The fruits are roughly the size of a ping pong ball or kumquat and contain a bluish-white pulp that is mildly sweet and delicately flavored. In the Philippines, the fruit of &quot;Passiflora foetida&quot; are known colloquially as &quot;marya-marya&quot; (&#x27;Little Mary&#x27;), &quot;balabalecua&quot; (in kapampangan), &quot;kurombot&quot;, &quot;utot-utot&quot;, and &quot;santo papa&quot; (due to its resemblance to the Pope&#x27;s mitre). Young leaves and plant tips are also edible. Dry leaves are used in tea in Vietnamese folk medicine to relieve sleeping problems, as well as treatment for itching and coughs.

<doc id="1064018" wikidata="Q644544" url="?curid=1064018" title="Confuciusornis">
<text>Confuciusornis is a genus of basal crow-sized avialan from the Early Cretaceous Period of the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations of China, dating from 125 to 120 million years ago. Like modern birds, &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; had a toothless beak, but closer and later relatives of modern birds such as &quot;Hesperornis&quot; and &quot;Ichthyornis&quot; were toothed, indicating that the loss of teeth occurred convergently in &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; and living birds. It was thought to be the oldest known bird to have a beak, though this title now belongs to an earlier relative &quot;Eoconfuciusornis&quot;. It was named after the Chinese moral philosopher Confucius (551–479 BC). &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; is one of the most abundant vertebrates found in the Yixian Formation, and several hundred complete specimens have been found.

==History of discovery==
In November 1993, the Chinese paleontologists Hou Lianhai and Hu Yoaming of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) at Beijing, visited fossil collector Zhang He at his home in Jinzhou, where he showed them a fossil bird specimen that he had bought at a local flea market. In December, Hou learned about a second specimen, which had been discovered by a farmer named Yang Yushan. Both specimens were found in the same locality in Shangyuan, Beipiao. In 1995, these two specimens, as well as a third one, were formally described as a new genus and species of bird, &quot;Confuciusornis sanctus&quot;, by Hou and colleagues. The generic name combines the philosopher Confucius with Greek ὄρνις (&quot;ornis&quot;), &quot;bird&quot;. The specific name means &quot;holy one&quot; in Latin and is a translation of Chinese 圣贤 (&quot;shèngxián)&quot;, &quot;sage&quot;, again in reference to Confucius. The first discovered specimen was designated the holotype and catalogued under the specimen number IVPP V10918; it comprises a partial skeleton with skull and parts of the forelimb. Of the other two skeletons, one (paratype, IVPP V10895) comprises a complete pelvis and hind limb, and the other (paratype, IVPP V10919–10925) a fragmentary hind limb together with six feather impressions attached to both sides of the tibia (shin bone). It was soon noted that the two paratype specimens only comprise bones that are unknown from the holotype, and that this lack of overlap makes their referral to the species speculative. Only the discovery of a great number of well-preserved specimens shortly after had confirmed that the specimens indeed represent a single species.

Together with the early mammal &quot;Zhangheotherium&quot;, which was discovered at around the same time, &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was considered to be the most remarkable fossil discovery of the Jehol Biota, which in the next decades would reveal the most important record of Mesozoic birds worldwide. In the late 1990s, &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was thought to be both the oldest beaked bird as well as the earliest bird after &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. It was also considered to be only slightly younger than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; – the Yixian Formation, the rock unit where most &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; specimens have been found, was thought to be of Late Jurassic (Tithonian) age at the time. Although two bird genera, &quot;Sinornis&quot; and &quot;Cathayornis&quot;, had already described from the Jehol biota in 1992, these were only based on fragmentary remains and stem from the younger Jiufotang Formation, which was considered to be of Early Cretaceous age. Later, both formations have been dated to the Lower Cretaceous (Barremian to Aptian stages, 131–120 million years ago).

In 1995, local farmers began digging for fossils near the village of Sihetun, Beipiao, in what would become one of the most productive localities of the Jehol biota. Large-scale professional excavations at this single locality have been carried out by the IVPP from 1997 onwards; recovered fossils include several hundred specimens of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;. Many additional sites producing fossils of the Jehol biota have been recognized since, distributed over a large region including Liaoning, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia. Due to the great abundance, preservation, and commercial value of the fossils, excavations by local farmers produced an unusually high number of fossils. Although a portion of these fossils have been added to the collections of Chinese research institutions, more have probably been smuggled out of the country. In 1999, it was estimated that the National Geological Museum of China in Beijing housed nearly 100 specimens of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, and in 2010, the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature was reported to possess 536 specimens of the bird. The majority of specimens, however, are held privately and thus are not available for research.

At one time forty individuals were discovered on a surface of about 100 m2. This has been explained as the result of entire flocks of birds being simultaneously killed by ash, heat or poisonous gas following the volcanic eruptions that caused the tuff stone in which the fossils were found to be deposited as lake sediments.

===Additional species and synonyms===
Since the description of &quot;Confuciusornis sanctus&quot;, five additional species have been formally named and described. As with many other fossil genera, species are difficult to define, as differences between species can often not be readily distinguished from variation that occurs within a species. In the case of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, only &quot;C. sanctus&quot; is universally accepted.

* &quot;Confuciusornis chuonzhous&quot; was named by Hou in 1997 based on specimen IVPP V10919, originally a paratype of &quot;C. sanctus&quot;. The specific name refers to Chuanzhou, an ancient name for Beipiao. &quot;C. chuonzhous&quot; is now generally considered synonymous with &quot;C. sanctus&quot;.
* &quot;Confuciusornis suniae&quot;, named by Hou in the same 1997 publication, was based on specimen IVPP V11308. The specific name honours madam Sun, the wife of Shikuan Liang who donated the fossil to the IVPP. &quot;C. suniae&quot; is now usually considered synonymous with &quot;C. sanctus&quot;.
*&quot;Confuciusornis dui&quot; was named by Hou and colleagues in 1999. The specific name again honours the donating collector, Du Wengya. The holotype specimen (IVPP V11553) is a nearly complete skeleton of an adult that includes a pair of long tail feathers and the impression of the horny beak. A second specimen, the paratype IVPP 11521, is fragmentary and includes some vertebrae and ribs, tail, sternum and pelvis, and femora. According to Hou and colleagues, &quot;C. dui&quot; was smaller and more gracile than most other &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; specimens, with the holotype being ca. 15% smaller than the holotype of &quot;C. sanctus&quot; and ca. 30% smaller than larger individuals of that species. The jaw tips were more pointed than in &quot;C. sanctus&quot;, and the mandible lacked the underside keel that is distinct in the latter species. Further differences to the type species can be found in the postcranium: The claw on the first digit was not enlarged as in &quot;C. sanctus&quot;. The sternum was more elongate and differed in anatomical details, and the lower segment of the hind limb (the tarsometatarsus) was shorter than the pygostyle of the tail. A statistical analysis by Marguán-Lobon and colleagues in 2011 revealed no significant differences to specimens referred to the smallest size class of &quot;C. sanctus&quot;, suggesting that the supposed differences are individual variations of a single species. However, these authors could not re-locate the &quot;C. dui&quot; holotype, which is possibly lost, and therefore had to rely on a cast of that specimen for their measurements. A re-study of the &quot;C. dui&quot; specimens would be required in order to evaluate the validity of the species.
*&quot;Confuciusornis feducciai&quot; was named in 2009 by Zhang Fucheng and colleagues, the specific name honouring ornithologist Alan Feduccia. The holotype, D2454, was discovered at the Sihetun locality and is kept at the Dalian Natural Museum. According to Zhang and colleagues, &quot;C. feducciai&quot; differed from other &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; species in its larger size, skeletal proportions, and a number of morphological features. The forelimb was 15% longer than the hind limb, while they were of equal length in &quot;C. sanctus&quot;. The upper end of the humerus lacked the large opening (foramen) that is characteristic for other &quot;Confuciusornis specimens&quot;. The first phalanx of the first digit was more slender. Other differences occur in the furcula, which was V-shaped; the sternum, which was broader than long; and the ischium, which was long compared to the pubis. Marguán-Lobon and colleagues, in 2011, argued that this diagnosis is problematic. The large opening in the humerus, although apparently absent in the left humerus, was clearly present in the right humerus of the holotype. Furthermore, their statistical analysis found the specimen to fall well within the continuum of variation of &quot;C. sanctus&quot;. These authors therefore proposed that &quot;C. feducciai&quot; is identical (a junior synonym) of &quot;C. sanctus&quot;.
*&quot;Confuciusornis jianchangensis&quot; was named in 2010 by Li Li and colleagues, based on specimen PMOL-AB00114 found at Toudaoyingzi. In contrast to most other species, which stem from the Yixian Formation, &quot;C. jianchangensis&quot; is found in the Jiufotang Formation.

In 2002 Hou named the genus &quot;Jinzhouornis&quot;, but Chiappe et al. (2018) and Wang et al. (2018) showed that this genus is a junior synonym of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; based on morphometry and examination of known confuciusornithiform specimens.

==Description==
===Size===
&quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was about the size of a modern crow, with a total length of and a wingspan of up to . Its body weight has been estimated to have been as much as , or as little as . &quot;C. feducciai&quot; was about a third longer than average specimens of &quot;C. sanctus&quot;.

===Distinguishing traits===
&quot;Confuciusornis&quot; shows a mix of basal and derived traits. It was more &quot;advanced&quot; or derived than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; in possessing a short tail with a pygostyle (a bone formed from a series of short, fused tail vertebrae) and a bony sternum (breastbone), but more basal or &quot;primitive&quot; than modern birds in retaining large claws on the forelimbs, having a primitive skull with a closed eye-socket, and a relatively small breastbone. At first the number of basal characteristics was exaggerated: Hou assumed in 1995 that a long tail was present and mistook grooves in the jaw bones for small degenerated teeth.

===Skull===
The skull morphology of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; has been difficult to determine, due to the crushed and deformed nature of the fossils. The skull was near triangular in side view, and the toothless beak was robust and pointed. The front of the jaws had deep neurovascular foramina and grooves, associated with the keratinous rhamphotheca (horn-covered beak). The skull was rather robust, with deep jaws, especially the mandible. The tomial crest of the upper jaw (a bony support for the jaw&#x27;s cutting edge) was straight for its entire length. The premaxillae (front bones of the upper jaw) were fused together for most of the front half of the snout, but were separated at the tip by a V-shaped notch. The frontal processes that projected hindwards from the premaxillae were thin and extended above the orbits (eye openings) like in modern birds, but unlike &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and other primitive birds without pygostyles, where these processes end in front of the orbits. The maxilla (the second large bone of the upper jaw) and premaxilla articulated by an oblique suture, and the maxilla had an extensive palatal shelf. The nasal bone was smaller than in most birds, and had a slender process that directed down towards the maxilla. The orbit was large, round, and contained sclerotic plates (the bony support inside the eye). A crescent-shaped element that formed the front wall of the orbit may be an ethmoidolacrimal complex similar to that of pigeons, but the identity of these bones is unclear due to bad preservation, and the fact that this region is very variable in modern birds. The external nares (bony nostrils) were near triangular and positioned far from the tip of the snout. The borders of the nostrils were formed by the premaxillae above, the maxilla below, and the nasal wall at the back.
Few specimens preserve the sutures of the braincase, but one specimen shows that the frontoparietal suture crossed the skull just behind the postorbital process and the hindmost wall of the orbit. This was similar to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Enaliornis&quot;, whereas it curves back and crosses the skull roof much farther behind in modern birds, making the frontal bone of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; small compared to those of modern birds. A prominent supraorbital flange formed the upper border of the orbit, and continued as the postorbital process, which had prominent crests which projected outwards to the sides, forming an expansion of the orbit&#x27;s rim. The squamosal bone was fully incorporated into the braincase wall, making its exact borders impossible to determine, which is also true for adult modern birds. Various interpretations have been proposed of the morphology and identity of the bones in the temporal region behind the orbits, but it may not be resolvable with the available fossils. &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was considered the first known bird with an ancestral diapsid skull (with two temporal fenestrae on each side of the skull) in the late 1990s, but in 2018, Elzanowski and colleagues concluded that the configuration seen in the temporal region of confuciusornithids was autapomorphic (a unique trait that evolved secondarily rather than having been retained from a primitive condition) for their group. The quadrate bone and the back end of the jugal bar were bound in a complex scaffolding that connected the squamosal bone with the lower end of the postorbital process. This scaffolding consisted of two bony bridges, the temporal bar and the orbitozygomatic junction, which gave the appearance of the temporal opening being divided similarly to diapsid skulls, though this structure is comparable to bridges over the temporary fossa in modern birds.

The mandible (lower jaw) is one of the best preserved parts of the skull. It was robust, especially at the front third of its length. The tomial crest was straight for its entire length, and a notch indented the sharp tip of the mandible. The mandible was spear-shaped in side view, due to its lower margin slanting downwards and back from its tip for the front third of its length (the jaw was also deepest at a point one third from the tip). The symphyseal part (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) of the dentary was very robust. The lower margin formed an angle at the level of the front margin of the nasal foramen, which indicates how far back the rhamphotheca of the beak extended. The dentary had three processes that extended backwards into other bones placed further back in the mandible. The articular bone at the back of the mandible was completely fused with the surangular and prearticular bones. The mandible extended hindwards beyond the cotyla (which connected with the condyle of the upper jaw), and this part was therefore similar to a retroarticular process as seen in other taxa. The surangular enclosed two mandibular fenestrae. The hindmost part of the surangular had a small foramen placed in the same position as similar openings in the mandibles of non-bird theropods and modern birds. The splenial bone was three-pronged (as in some modern birds, but unlike the simple splenial of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;), and its lower margin followed the lower margin of the mandible. There was a large rostral mandibular fenestra and a small, rounded caudal fenestra behind it.

Though only five specimens preserve parts of the beak&#x27;s keratinous covering, these show that there would have been differences between species not seen in the skeleton. The holotype of &quot;C. dui&quot; preserves the outline of an upwards curving beak which sharply tapers towards its tip, while a &quot;C. sanctus&quot; specimen (IVPP V12352) has an upper margin that is almost straight, and a tip that appears to be slightly hooked downwards. Two further specimens (STM13-133 and STM13-162) belonging to an indeterminate species were described in 2020; the former suggests that, unlike modern birds, the beak on both jaws was made up of two separate elements that met at the midline, with feathers growing between them on the upper jaw. Also unlike modern birds, these specimens suggest that the upper beak extended backwards onto the maxilla due to the presence of foramina.

===Postcranial skeleton===

The various specimens seem to have a variable number of neck vertebrae, some showing eight, others nine. The first vertebra, the atlas, bore a faint keel on the underside. The next, the axis, had an expanded spinal process on the top and its side was excavated by an elongated groove in the side. The remaining neck vertebrae all had rather low spinal processes. There is no clear evidence of a pneumatisation, in the form of internal air spaces, of the vertebral bodies of the neck. The front articulation facets of the neck vertebrae were saddle-shaped. Their undersides were pinched.

There were at least twelve back vertebrae. They were amphiplatian, flat at both ends, and had rather small intervertebral foramina, the spaces between the vertebral body and the neural arch. Their spinal processes were tall and narrow in side view. Their side processes projected horizontally and were deeply excavated at the rear underside. The sides of the back vertebrae also had deep oval excavations.

Seven sacral vertebrae were fused into a synsacrum. The front sacral vertebra had a round and concave front articulation facet. The vertebral bodies of the front half of the synsacrum were excavated at their sides, comparable to the back vertebrae. Robust side processes connected the synsacrum to the ilia of the pelvis.

Although earlier descriptions had counted four or five &quot;free&quot;, not fused, tail vertebrae, Chiappe e.a. in 1999 reported seven of them. These had round and somewhat concave front articulation facets. Their spinal processes were high and transversely compressed. The side processes were robust and stick out horizontally to the side. Their articulation processes were rather long. The last of these vertebrae had a rectangular profile. Its neural arch had short processes pointing obliquely to above and sideways. The tail ended in a pygostyle, a complete fusion of the last vertebrae. Their number is uncertain. The pygostyle was about 40% longer than the first part of the tail. At its underside the pygostyle bore a well-developed keel, running from front to rear. Its top was incised by a long groove between prominent ridges.

&quot;Confuciusornis&quot; had an exceptionally large humerus (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this &quot;crista deltopectoralis&quot; was with &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone&#x27;s weight or enlarged the attachment area of the flight muscles. The furcula or wishbone, like that of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a hypocleidium. The sternum was relatively broad and had a low keel which was raised at the back end. This bony keel may or may not have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged pectoral muscles. The scapulae (shoulder blades) were fused to the strut-like coracoid bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by Phil Senter in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight; the same would have been true for &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

The wrist of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; shows fusion, forming a carpometacarpus. The second and third metacarpals were also partially fused, but the first was unfused, and the fingers could freely move relative to each other. The second metacarpal, which supported the flight feathers, was very heavily built; its finger carries a small claw. The claw of the first finger to the contrary was very large and curved. The stub-like third metacarpal, which supported the calami of the feathers, was probably enclosed in the flesh of the hand. The formula of the finger phalanges was 2-3-4-0-0.
The pelvis was connected to a sacrum formed by seven sacral vertebrae. The pubis was strongly pointing backwards. The left and right ischia were not fused. The femur was straight; the tibia only slightly longer. The metatarsals of the foot were relatively short and fused to each other and to the lower ankle bones, forming a tarsometatarsus. A rudimentary fifth metatarsal is present. The first metatarsal was attached to the lower shaft of the second and supported a first toe or hallux, pointing to the back. The formula of the toe phalanges was 2-3-4-5-0. The proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching, while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing.

===Feathers and soft tissue===
The wing feathers of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; were long and modern in appearance. The primary wing feathers of a 0.5-kilogram individual reached 20.7 centimetres in length. The five longest primary feathers (&quot;remiges primarii&quot;) were more than times the length of the hand and relatively longer than those of any living bird, while the secondary feathers of the lower arm were rather short by comparison. The outermost primary was much shorter than the second outermost primary, creating a relatively round, broad wing. Its wing shape does not specifically match any particular shape found among living birds. The primary feathers were asymmetrical to varying degrees, and especially so in the outermost primaries. It is unclear whether the upper arm carried tertiaries. Covert feathers are preserved covering the upper part of the wing feathers in some specimens, and some specimens have preserved the contour feathers of the body.

Unlike some more advanced birds, &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; lacked an alula, or &quot;bastard wing&quot;. In modern birds this is formed by feathers anchored to the first digit of the hand, but this digit appears to have been free of feathers and independent of the body of the wing in &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;. According to Dieter Stefan Peters, to compensate for the lack of an alula, the third finger might have formed a separate winglet below the main wing, functioning like the flap of an aircraft. Despite the relatively advanced and long wing feathers, the forearm bones lacked any indication of quill knobs (&quot;papillae ulnares&quot;), or bony attachment points for the feather ligaments.

Many specimens preserve a pair of long, narrow tail feathers, which grew longer than the entire length of the rest of the body. Unlike the feathers of most modern birds, these feathers were not differentiated into a central quill and barbs for most of their length. Rather, most of the feather formed a ribbon-like sheet, about six millimetres wide. Only at the last one quarter of the feather, towards the rounded tip, does the feather become differentiated into a central shaft with interlocking barbs. Many individuals of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; lacked even these two tail feathers, possibly due to sexual dimorphism. The rest of the tail around the pygostyle was covered in short, non-aerodynamic feather tufts similar to the contour feathers of the body, rather than the familiar feather fan of modern bird tails.

Laser fluorescence of two &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; specimens revealed additional details of their soft-tissue anatomy. The propatagium of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was large, likely relatively thick, and extended from the shoulder to the wrist, as in modern birds; the extent of the postpatagium is also similar to modern birds. Reticulate scales covered the underside of the foot, and the phalanges and metatarsals supported large, fleshy pads, although the interphalangeal pads were either small or entirely absent.

===Plumage pattern===
In early 2010, a group of scientists led by Zhang Fucheng examined fossils with preserved melanosomes (organelles which contain colors). By studying such fossils with an electron microscope, they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; specimen, IVPP V13171. They reported the presence of melanosomes were of two types: eumelanosomes and pheomelanosomes. This indicated that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; had hues of grey, red/brown and black, possibly something like the modern zebra finch. It was also the first time an early bird fossil has been shown to contain preserved pheomelanosomes. However, a second research team failed to find these reported traces of pheomelanosomes. Their 2011 study also found a link between the presence of certain metals, like copper, and preserved melanin. Using a combination of fossil impressions of melanosomes and the presence of metals in the feathers, the second team of scientists reconstructed &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; with darkly colored body feathers and upper wing feathers, but found no trace of either melanosomes or metals in the majority of the wing feathers. They suggested that the wings of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; would have been white or, possibly, colored with carotenoid pigments. The long tail feathers of male specimens would have also been dark in color along their entire length.

A 2018 study of the specimen CUGB P1401 indicated the presence of heavy spotting on the wings, throat, and crest of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;.

==Classification==

Hou assigned &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; to the Confuciusornithidae in 1995. At first he assumed it was a member of the Enantiornithes and the sister taxon of &quot;Gobipteryx&quot;. Later he understood that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was not an enantiornithean but concluded it was the sister taxon of the Enantiornithes, within a larger Sauriurae. This was heavily criticised by Chiappe who regarded Sauriurae to be paraphyletic as there were insufficient shared traits that indicated that the Confuciusornithidae and the Enantiornithes were closely related. In 2001, Ji Qiang suggested an alternative position as the sister taxon of the Ornithothoraces.

In 2002 Ji&#x27;s hypothesis was confirmed by a cladistic analysis by Chiappe, who defined a new group: the Pygostylia of which &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; is by definition the most basal member. Several traits of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; show its position in bird evolution; it has a more &quot;primitive&quot; skull than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, but it is the first known bird to have lost the long tail of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and develop fused tail vertebrae, a pygostyle. One controversial study concluded that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; may be more closely related to &quot;Microraptor&quot; and other dromaeosaurids than to &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, but this study was criticized on methodological grounds.
The present standard interpretation of the phylogenetic position of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; can be shown in this cladogram:

A close relative, the confuciusornithid &quot;Changchengornis hengdaoziensis&quot;, also lived in the Yixian Formation. &quot;Changchengornis&quot; also possessed the paired, long tail feathers, as did several more advanced enantiornith birds. True, mobile tail fans only appeared in ornithuromorph birds, and possibly in the enantiornithine &quot;Shanweiniao&quot;.

==Paleobiology==

The large, fleshy phalangeal foot pads, small interphalangeal foot pads, presence of only reticulate scales on the underside of the foot (which increases flexibility), and curved foot claws of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; are all traits shared with modern tree-dwelling, perching birds, suggesting that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; may have had a similar lifestyle.

Comparisons between the scleral rings supporting the eyes of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; and modern birds and other reptiles indicate that it may have been diurnal, similar to most modern birds.

===Flight===
&quot;Confuciusornis&quot; has traditionally been assumed to have been a competent flier based on its extremely long wings with strongly asymmetrical feathers. Other adaptations for improved flight capabilities include: a fused wrist, a short tail, an ossified sternum with a central keel, a strut-like coracoid, a large deltopectoral crest, a strong ulna (forearm bone) and an enlarged second metacarpal. The sternal keel and deltopectoral crest (which provides a more powerful upstroke) are adaptations to flapping flight in modern birds, indicating that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; may have been capable of the same. However, it may have had a different flight stroke due to being incapable of rotating its arm behind the body, and its relatively smaller sternal keel indicates that it likely was not capable of flight for extended periods of time.

Several contrary claims have been made against that the flight capabilities of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;. The first of these regarded problems to attain a steep flight path due to a limited wing amplitude. In Senter&#x27;s interpretation of the position of the shoulder joint, a normal upstroke would be impossible precluding flapping flight entirely. Less radical is the assessment that due to the lack of a keeled sternum and a high acrocoracoid, the &quot;musculus pectoralis minor&quot; could not serve as a &quot;M. supracoracoideus&quot; lifting the humerus via a tendon running through a . This, coupled with a limited upstroke caused by a lateral position of the shoulder joint, would have made it difficult to gain altitude. Some authors, therefore, proposed that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; used its large thumb claws to climb tree trunks. Martin assumed that it could raise its torso almost vertically like a squirrel. Daniel Hembree, however, while acknowledging that tree climbing was likely, pointed out that the rump was apparently not lifted more than 25° relative to the femur in vertical position, as shown by the location of the antitrochanter in the hip joint. Dieter S. Peters considered it very unlikely that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; climbed trunks as turning the thumb claw inwards would stretch the very long wing forwards, right in the path of obstructing branches. Peters sees &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; as capable of flapping flight but specialised in soaring flight.
Also a controversy is the strength of the feathers. In 2010, Robert Nudds and Gareth Dyke published a study arguing that in both &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, the raches (central shafts) of the primary feathers were too thin and weak to have remained rigid during the power stroke required for true flight. They argued that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; would at most have employed gliding flight, which is also consistent with the unusual adaptations seen in its upper arm bones, and more likely used its wings for mere parachuting, limiting fall speed if it dropped from a tree. Gregory S. Paul, however, disagreed with their study. He argued that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the weights of these early birds, and that more accurate weight estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow raches. Nudds and Dyke assumed a weight of for &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, as heavy as the modern teal. Paul argued that a more reasonable body weight estimate is about , less than that of a pigeon. Paul also noted that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; is commonly found as large assemblages in lake bottom sediments with little to no evidence of extensive postmortem transport, and that it would be highly unusual for gliding animals to be found in such large numbers in deep water. Rather, this evidence suggests that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; traveled in large flocks over the lake surfaces, a habitat consistent with a flying animal. A number of researchers have questioned the correctness of the rachis measurements, stating that the specimens they had studied showed a shaft thickness of , compared to as reported by Nudds and Dyke. Nudd and Dyke replied that, apart from the weight aspect, such greater shaft thickness alone would make flapping flight possible; however, they allowed for the possibility of two species being present in the Chinese fossil material with a differing rachis diameter.

In 2016, Falk &quot;et al.&quot; argued in favor of flight capabilities for &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; using evidence from laser fluorescence of two soft tissue-preserving specimens. They found that, contrary to Nudds and Dyke&#x27;s assertions, the raches of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; were relatively robust, with a maximum width of over . The wing shape is consistent with either birds that live in dense forests or gliding birds; the former is consistent with its environment being densely forested, and requiring more maneuverability and stability than speed. The substantial propatagium would have produced a generous amount of lift, while the likewise large postpatagium would have provided a large attachment area for the calami of the feathers, which would have kept them as a straight airfoil. This collectively is strongly indicative that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was capable of powered flight, if not only for short periods of time.

===Tail feathers===

Many specimens of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; preserve a single pair of long, streamer-like tail feathers, similar to those present in some modern birds-of-paradise. Specimens lacking these feathers include ones that otherwise have exquisitely preserved feathers on the rest of the body, indicating that their absence is not simply due to poor preservation. Larry Martin and colleagues stated in 1998 that long tail feathers are present in about 5 to 10% of the specimens known at the time. A 2011 analysis by Jesús Marugán-Lobón and colleagues found that out of 130 specimens, 18% had long tail feathers and 28% had not, while in the remaining 54% preservation was insufficient to determine their presence or absence. The biological meaning of this pattern has been discussed controversially. Martin and colleagues suggested that the pattern might reflect sexual dimorphism, with the streamer-like feathers only present in one sex (likely the males) which used them in courtship displays. This interpretation was followed by the majority of subsequent studies. Chiappe and colleagues, in 1999, argued that sexual dimorphism is not the only but the most reasonable explanation, noting that in modern birds the length of ornamental feathers often varies between the sexes.
Controversy arose from the observation that the known specimens of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; can be divided into a small-sized and a large-sized group, but that this bimodal distribution is unrelated to the possession of long tail feathers. Chiappe and colleagues argued in 2008 that this size distribution can be explained by a dinosaur-like mode of growth (see section Growth), and maintained that sexual dimorphism is the most likely explanation for the presence and absence of long tail feathers. Winfried and Dieter Peters, however, responded in 2009 that both sexes likely had long tail feathers, as is the case in most modern birds that show similar feathers. One of the sexes, however, would have been larger than the other (sexual size dimorphism). These researchers further suggested that the distribution of size and long tail feathers in &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was similar to the modern pheasant-tailed jacana (&quot;Hydrophasianus chirurgus&quot;), a water-bird in which and the female is largest and adult individuals of both sexes have long tails, but only during the breeding season. &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; differs from the jacanas in that long tail feathers are present in specimens of all sizes, even in some of the smallest known specimens. This suggests that the long tail feathers might not have had a function in reproduction at all.

Several alternative hypotheses explaining the frequent absence of long tail feathers have been proposed. In their 1999 study, Chiappe and colleagues discussed the possibility that individuals might lack tail feathers because they died during molting. Although direct evidence for molting in early birds is missing, the lack of feather abrasion in &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; specimens suggests that the plumage got periodically renewed. As in modern birds, molting individuals may have been present alongside non-molting individuals, and males and females may have molted at different times during the year, possibly explaining the co-occurrence of specimens with and without long tail feathers. Peters and Petters, on the other hand, suggested that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; may have shed the feathers as a defense mechanism, a method used by several extant species. Such shedding would have been triggered by stress induced by the very volcanic explosions that buried the animals, resulting in a large number of specimens lacking these feathers. In a 2011 paper, Jesús Marugán-Lobón and colleagues stated that even the presence of two separate species, one with and one without long tail feathers, needs to be considered. This possibility would be, however, unsubstantiated at present, as other anatomical differences between these possible species are not apparent.

===Reproduction===
In 2007, Gary Kaiser mentioned a &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; skeleton preserving an egg near its right foot – the first possible egg referable to the genus. The skeleton is from the short-tailed form and thus might represent a female. The egg might have fallen out of the body after the death of the presumed female, although it cannot be excluded that this association of an adult with an egg was only by chance. The egg is roundish in shape and measures 17 mm in diameter, slightly smaller than the head of the animal; according to Kaiser, it would have fit precisely through the pelvic canal of the bird. In dinosaurs and Mesozoic birds, the width of the pelvic canal was restricted due to connection of the lower ends of the pubic bones, resulting in a V-shaped bony aperture through which eggs must fit. In modern birds, this connection of the pubic bones is lost, presumably allowing for larger eggs. In a 2010 paper, Gareth Dyke and Kaiser showed that the breadth of the &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; egg was indeed smaller than what would be expected for a modern bird of similar size. In a 2016 book, Luis Chiappe and Meng Qingjin stated that the aperture of a large specimen (DNHM-D 2454) indicates a maximum egg diameter of . In modern birds, proportionally large eggs are commonly found in species whose hatchlings do fully depend on their parents (altriciality), while smaller eggs are often found in species whose hatchlings are more developed and independent (precociality). As the estimated egg of the specimen would have been around 30% smaller than expected for a modern altricial bird, it is likely that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was precocial. A 2018 study by Charles Deeming and Gerald Mayr measured the size of the pelvic canal of various Mesozoic birds including &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; to estimate egg size, concluding that eggs would have been small in proportion to body mass for Mesozoic birds in general. These researchers further posit that an avian-style contact incubation (sitting on eggs for breeding) was not possible for non-avian dinosaurs and Mesozoic birds, including &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, as these animals would have been too heavy in relation to the size of their eggs. Kaiser, in 2007, argued that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; likely did not brood in an open nest but might have used crevices in trees for protection, and that the small size of the only known egg indicates large clutch sizes. In contrast, a 2016 review by David Varricchio and Frankie Jackson argued that nesting above the ground evolved only at a much later stage, within Neornithes, and that Mesozoic birds would have buried their eggs on the ground, either fully or partially, as seen in non-avian dinosaurs.

===Growth===
Growth can be reconstructed based on the inner bone structure. The first such study on &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, presented by Fucheng Zhang and colleagues in 1998, used scanning electron microscopy to analyze a femur in cross section. Because the bone was well vascularized (contained many blood vessels) and showed only a single line of arrested growth (growth ring), these authors determined that growth must have been fast and continuous as in modern birds, and that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; must have been endothermic. Zhang and colleagues corroborated this claim in a subsequent paper, stating that the bone structure was unlike that of a modern ectothermic alligator but similar to the feathered non-avian dinosaur &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;. However, these authors assumed that endothermy in &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; had evolved independently from that seen in modern birds. This concurred with earlier work by Anusuya Chinsamy and colleagues, who described distinct lines of arrested growth and low vascularity in other Mesozoic birds that are more derived than &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;. Both features indicate slow growth, which, according to Chinsamy and colleagues, suggests low metabolic rates. Full endothermy, therefore, would have evolved late on the evolutionary line leading to modern birds. This view was contested by subsequent studies, which pointed out that slow growing bone is not necessarily an indicator for low metabolic rates, and in the case of Mesozoic birds was rather a result of the decrease in body size that characterized the early evolution of birds. A more comprehensive study based on thin sectioning of bones was published by Armand de Ricqlès and colleagues in 2003. Based on 80 thin sections taken from an adult &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; exemplar, this study confirmed the high growth rates proposed by Zhang and colleagues. The fast-growing fibrolamellar bone tissue was similar to that seen in non-avian theropods, and the sampled individual probably reached adult size in much less than 20 weeks. Small body size was not primarily achieved by slowing growth but by shortening the period of rapid growth. The growth rate estimated for &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; is still lower than the extremely fast growth characteristic for modern birds (6–8 weeks), suggesting that that growth was secondarily accelerated later in avian evolution.

In 2008 Chiappe and colleagues conducted a statistical analysis based on 106 specimens to explore the relationship between body size and the possession of long tail feathers. The population showed a clear bimodal distribution of the size of the animals with two distinct weight classes. However, there was no correlation between size and the possession of the long tail feathers. From this it was concluded that either the sexes did not differ in size or both sexes had the long feathers. The first case was deemed most likely which left the size distribution to be explained. It was hypothesized that the smaller animals consisted of very young individuals, that the large animals were adults and that the rarity of individuals with an intermediate size was caused by &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; experiencing a growth spurt just prior to reaching adulthood, the shortness of which would have prevented many becoming fossilized during this phase. This initially slow growth followed by a growth spurt would have resulted in a S-shaped growth curve, similar to that inferred for non-avian dinosaurs. Such an extended dinosaurian mode of growth conflicts with the earlier histological findings of de Ricqlès that suggest a much shorter, avian-style growth. Alternatively, the observed size distribution might also be explained by the presence of more than one species, although there are no anatomical features that could be correlated with these potential species. It could also be explained by assuming an attritional death assemblage, in which mortality rates (and thus the number of preserved fossils) are highest in young and in very old individuals.

The idea of a dinosaur-like mode of growth was criticized by Winfried and Dieter Peters in 2008, who argued that the body size of the smaller size class was too large to possibly have represented the youngest growth state. Analyzing an extended data set, these researchers identified a third size class that supposedly represented this youngest growth state. As it would be highly unlikely that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; showed two distinct growth spurts, a feature unseen in known amniotes, they concluded that the two larger size classes represented the two sexes rather than growth stages (sexual size dimorphism). The long tail feathers would have occurred in both sexes, one of which was the largest. This interpretation is consistent with an avian-style mode of growth, as it was suggested by the earlier histological studies. It is also consistent with comparisons to modern birds, in which long tail feathers are typically unrelated to the sexes. The absence of long tail feathers in many specimens was suggested to be the result of stress-induced shedding prior to death.

Chiappe and colleagues defended their findings in a 2010 comment, arguing that the assumed short, avian-like growth period is unlikely. The calculation presented by De Ricqlès in 2003 of a growth phase of less than 20 weeks was based on the assumption that bone diameters grew by 10 μm per day, which is subjective. Rather, histology reveals the presence of different tissue types in the bone that grew at different rates, as well as pauses in growth as indicated by the lines of arrested growth. Thus, growth periods must have been longer than in modern birds and likely took several years, as is true for the modern kiwi. The observed size distribution can, therefore, be feasibly explained by assuming a dinosaurian-style growth. In an invited reply in 2010, Peters and Peters stated that Chiappe and colleagues did not comment on their main argument, the gap in body size between the smaller size class and inferred hatchlings, which accounts for one order of magnitude and would be most consistent with a sexual size dimorphism. Marugán-Lobón and colleagues studied the relationships between the presence and absence of long tail feathers and the lengths of various long bones of the arms and limbs, using a once more enlarged sample of 130 specimens. While confirming that the tail feathers are unrelated to body size, their presence corresponds to different proportions of the forelimb compared to the hind limb. The authors concluded that the meaning of the observed distributions of both the tail feathers and the body size remains contentious.

Chiappe and colleagues, in their 2008 study, concluded that limb bones growth was almost isometric, meaning that skeletal proportions did not change during growth. This was contested by Peters and Peters in 2009, who observed that wing bones tended to be proportionally longer in very small individuals, as seen in modern chicken, and thus grew allometrically. Chiappe and colleagues, in their 2010 comment, responded that proportional variation is present across the whole size range, and that the presence of allometry was not conclusively demonstrated by the analyses presented by Peters and Peters.

===Possible medullary bone===
A 2013 histological study by Anusuya Chinsamy and colleagues found medullary bone within the long bones of a short tailed specimen (DNHM-D1874), while three long-tailed specimens lacked medullary bone. In modern birds, medullary bone only forms temporarily in females, where it functions as a calcium reservoir for eggshell production. Therefore, these authors suggested short-tailed specimens to be females, and long-tailed specimens to be males. The female specimen had already passed its rapid growth phase, although it was still significantly smaller than the maximum size reached by &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; exemplars. At least two lines of arrested growth (growth lines that form annually) could be identified, demonstrating an extended growth over several years; the studied female would have been in its third year. Long tail feathers were confirmed to occur in small individuals, the smallest of which was only around 23% the mass of the largest specimens. Assuming that the occurrence of tail feathers indicates sexual maturity, the authors concluded that the latter must have occurred well before the animals reached their final size, unlike in birds but similar to non-avian dinosaurs. In a 2018 study, Jingmai O&#x27;Connor and colleagues questioned the identification of medullary bone, arguing that the purported medullary bone was only found in the forelimb, while in modern birds it is mostly present in the hind limb. Furthermore, the tissue in question is merely preserved as small fragments, rendering its interpretation difficult. However, the authors were able to identify medullary bone in the hind limb of an enantiornithine, a more derived group of Mesozoic birds. As is the case with the &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; specimen, this supposed female did not reach its final size, supporting the dinosaur-like mode of growth in basal birds that was inferred by the earlier studies.

===Diet===
In 1999, Chinese paleontologist Lianhai Hou and colleagues suggested that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was likely herbivorous, though no stomach contents were yet known, pointing out that the beak curved upwards and was not raptorial. Paleontologists Dieter S. Peters and Ji Qiang hypothesized in 1999 that, although no remains of toe webs have been conserved, it caught its prey swimming using its rather soft bill to search for prey below the waterline. Several extant bird species have been presented as modern analogues of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; providing insight into its possible lifestyle. Peters thought that it could be best compared with the white-tailed tropicbird (&quot;Phaeton lepturus&quot;), a fisher that too has a long tail and narrow wings—and even often nests in the neighbourhood of volcanoes.

Polish paleontologist Andrzej Elżanowski, in 2002, found it unlikely that a long-winged and short-legged bird like &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; would forage in tree crowns, and instead proposed that it foraged on the wing, seizing prey from the water or ground surface. Indications for this included the combination of long wings that appear adapted for soaring, leg proportions (long femur, short foot) that are similar to those of frigate birds and kingfishers, and occipital foramen that opened at the back, a toothless beak similar to but shorter than that of kookaburras, and the absence of specializations for swimming. He conceded that &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; may have been able to swim, as it possibly foraged over water.

In 2003 Chinese paleontologists Zhonghe Zhou and Fucheng Zhang stated that though nothing was known about its diet, its robust and toothless jaws suggested it could have fed on seeds, and noted &quot;Jeholornis&quot; preserved direct evidence of such a diet.

In 2006, Johan Dalsätt and colleagues described a &quot;C. sanctus&quot; specimen (IVPP V13313) from the Jiufotang Beds which preserves seven to nine vertebrae and several ribs of a small fish, probably &quot;Jinanichthys&quot;. These fish bones are formed into a tight cluster about across, and the cluster is in contact with the seventh and eighth cervical vertebrae of the bird. The condition of the fish indicates it was about to be regurgitated as a pellet, or that it was stored in the crop. No other fish remains are present in the slab. Though it is unknown how common fish were in the diet of &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;, the finding did not support a herbivorous diet, and the researchers pointed out that no specimens have been found with gastroliths (stomach stones), which are swallowed by birds to help digest plant fibers. Instead, they suggested it would have been omnivorous, similar to for example crows.

Andrei Zinoviev assumed it caught fish on the wing.

The skull was relatively immobile, incapable of the kinesis of modern birds that can raise the snout relative to the back of the skull. This immobility was caused by the presence of a triradiate postorbital separating the eye socket from the lower temporal opening, as with more basal theropod dinosaurs, and the premaxillae of the snout reaching all the way to the frontals, forcing the nasals to the sides of the snout.

== Paleoenvironment and paleoecology ==
&quot;Confuciusornis&quot; was discovered in the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations and is a member of the Jehol Biota. Tuff makes up a considerable amount of the rock composition in both due to frequent volcanic eruptions, which were slightly more frequent in the Yixian Formation. Shale and mudstone also are major components of the formations. The tuff has allowed detailed dating of the formations by using 40Ar-39Ar isotopes. This results in an age of approximately 125 to 120 million years ago for the Yixian formation and approximately 120.3 million years ago for the Jiufotang Formation. The fossils were buried as a result of flooding and volcanic debris. This method of preservation resulted in fossils that are very flat, almost two-dimensional. The volcanic strata have allowed the preservation of various soft tissues, such as detailed feather impressions. Using oxygen isotopes in reptile bones found in the formation, a 2010 study determined that many formations from East Asia, including the Yixian, had a cool temperate climate. The mean air temperature of the Yixian Formation was estimated at 10 °C ± 4 °C. Fossils of &quot;Xenoxylon&quot;, a type of wood known from temperate areas of the time, have been found throughout the region. Additionally, reptiles needing heat, such as crocodilians, are absent.

The majority of Jehol flora has been discovered in the lower Yixian Formation. This flora includes most groups of Mesozoic plants, including mosses, clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, seed ferns, Czekanowskiales, ginkgo trees, cycadeoids, Gnetales, conifers, and a small number of flowering plants. Fauna that were present in the Jehol Biota include ostracods, gastropods, bivalves, insects, fish, salamanders, mammals, lizards, choristoderes, pterosaurs, and dinosaurs (including birds). These fossils are exceptionally well preserved, with dinosaur fossils frequently preserving filaments and feather impressions and sometimes even pigmentation, such as in &quot;Microraptor&quot; (an aerial predator of the Jiufotang Formation), &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; (a small ceratopsian with a wide distribution throughout both formations), and &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; (a compsognathid and one of the first dinosaurs recovered from the Yixian). Other feathered dinosaurs of the Jehol Biota include the large compsognathid &quot;Sinocalliopteryx gigas&quot;, a specimen of which was discovered with &quot;Confuciusornis&quot; bones in its abdominal contents, the small herbivorous oviraptorosaur &quot;Caudipteryx&quot;, and the large tyrannosauroid &quot;Yutyrannus,&quot; all from the Yixian Formation&quot;.&quot; Jehol birds are represented by more than 20 genera, including basal avialans (such as &quot;Confucisornis&quot;, &quot;Jeholornis&quot;, and &quot;Sapeornis&quot;), more derived enantiornithes (such as &quot;Eoenantiornis&quot;, &quot;Longirostravis&quot;, &quot;Sinornis&quot;, &quot;Boluochia&quot;, and &quot;Longipteryx&quot;), and even further derived ornithurines (such as &quot;Liaoningornis&quot;, &quot;Yixianornis&quot;, and &quot;Yanornis&quot;).

<text>Object Lisp was a computer programming language, a dialect of the Lisp language. It was an object-oriented extension for the Lisp dialect Lisp Machine Lisp, designed by Lisp Machines, Inc. Object Lisp was also an early example of prototype-based programming.

It was seen as a competitor to other object-oriented extensions to Lisp at around the same time such as Flavors, in use by Symbolics, Common Objects developed by Hewlett-Packard, and CommonLoops, in use by Xerox.

Object Lisp was also used in early versions of Macintosh Common Lisp. There, the user interface toolkit was written using Object Lisp.

<text>Ronan John Ross O&#x27;Gara (born 7 March 1977) is an Irish former rugby union player and current coach. O&#x27;Gara played as a fly-half and is Ireland&#x27;s second most-capped player and second highest points scorer. He is currently head coach of La Rochelle in the French Top 14.
O&#x27;Gara won 128 caps for Ireland, winning three Triple Crowns and the Grand Slam in 2009. He also played on three British &amp; Irish Lions tours, winning two caps. He played for sixteen seasons with Munster, with whom he won two Heineken Cups.

O&#x27;Gara is the tenth most-capped and is the sixth highest points scorer in the history of test rugby. He is also Munster&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, and holds the Heineken Cup record for points and caps. O&#x27;Gara scored several match-winning drop goals for Munster and Ireland, including in the 78th minute of the Wales vs Ireland match in the 2009 Six Nations Championship, in which Ireland won the Grand Slam.

Since his retirement from playing, O&#x27;Gara has undertaken a coaching career. O&#x27;Gara began coaching in 2013 with French club Racing 92 as the club&#x27;s defence coach before becoming the assistant defence coach of the New Zealand club Crusaders in 2018. The Crusaders would win two Super Rugby titles while O&#x27;Gara was a member of their coaching team. O&#x27;Gara took up his first head coach role in 2019 when he returned to France and was announced as the new coach of Stade Rochelais. Since taking over as head coach, O&#x27;Gara has guided La Rochelle to three European Cup finals, the second of which in the 2022 final they beat Leinster to claim the club&#x27;s first ever major silverware, with a repeat performance in Dublin in the 2023 final.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Gara was born in San Diego, California, where his father, Fergal, was working as a post–doctoral fellow in microbiology. His father had also played wing for the UCG club in Connacht. His family moved back to Ireland when he was six months old.

O&#x27;Gara attended Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh primary school, before moving to Bishopstown Community School where his mother was a teacher. His mother is originally from County Mayo. After a year, his parents sent him to Presentation Brothers College, Cork, where he won a Junior Cup medal in 1992 and a Senior Cup medal in 1995. It was at Pres where O&#x27;Gara first came into contact with Declan Kidney, who was head of rugby at the school. Kidney would later go on to coach O&#x27;Gara with both Munster and Ireland.

O&#x27;Gara attended University College Cork and won an All-Ireland Under-20 medal in 1996. He graduated with a B.A. and a master&#x27;s degree in Business Economics in 1999.

==Munster==

===1997–2007===
O&#x27;Gara made his Munster debut alongside longtime Munster and Ireland teammate David Wallace against Connacht in August 1997, scoring 19 points. O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s Heineken Cup debut came against Harlequins in September 1997 in the 1997–98 Heineken Cup. O&#x27;Gara kicked 15 points, but Munster lost the game 48–40. He started for Munster in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final, which Northampton Saints won 8–9, and again in the 2002 Heineken Cup Final, which Leicester Tigers won 15–9.

O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s last minute conversion against Gloucester on 18 January 2003 helped Munster to a 27-point victory which took them through to the Heineken Cup quarter final; this match has come to be known in Munster folklore as the &quot;Miracle Match&quot;. He was part of the Munster team that won the 2002–03 Celtic League, starting and scoring 12 points as Munster beat Neath 37–17 in the Millennium Stadium. O&#x27;Gara turned down the chance to join NFL side Miami Dolphins in March 2003. He started when Munster beat Llanelli Scarlets to win the Celtic Cup in May 2005, scoring 17 points in the game.

O&#x27;Gara played a key part in Munster&#x27;s Heineken Cup winning team of 2006. O&#x27;Gara had an important role in Munster&#x27;s semi-final victory over rivals Leinster by scoring 20 points, including a 77th minute try. On 20 May 2006, O&#x27;Gara kicked 13 points in Munster&#x27;s first Heineken Cup Final victory over Biarritz at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

On 22 October 2006, O&#x27;Gara kicked a last minute penalty from inside his own half to win Munster a 21–19 victory over Leicester Tigers in the first round of the pool stages at Welford Road. O&#x27;Gara scored 15 points during Munster&#x27;s win in the 2006–07 Heineken Cup pool game against French side Bourgoin on 14 January 2007. He kicked 5 points in Munster&#x27;s quarter-final defeat to Scarlets on 30 March 2007.

===2008–2013===
On 19 January 2008, O&#x27;Gara captained Munster to victory against Wasps in their final pool match of the 2007–08 Heineken Cup, knocking the incumbent champions out and making it through to quarter finals of the cup for the tenth consecutive season. On 24 May 2008, O&#x27;Gara won his second Heineken Cup medal as Munster beat Toulouse 16–13 in the 2008 Heineken Cup Final, with O&#x27;Gara scoring 11 points.

O&#x27;Gara scored a penalty with three minutes left to beat Montauban in the first game of the 2008–09 Heineken Cup and the first Heineken Cup game in the new Thomond Park. On 13 December 2008, O&#x27;Gara became the first player to score 1,000 points in the Heineken Cup, when he scored a last minute conversion against Clermont.

On 16 May 2010, O&#x27;Gara was awarded the ERC European Player Award, crediting him as the player who had made the greatest contribution to European Rugby during the first 15 years of the Heineken Cup. The selection panel consisted of Sir Ian McGeechan, Lawrence Dallaglio, Ieuan Evans, Fabien Galthié, Donal Lenihan, Michael Lynagh, Stuart Barnes, Stephen Jones and Jacques Verdier.
O&#x27;Gara crossed the 2,000-point mark for Munster against Ospreys in a Celtic League game on 18 September 2010. In November 2010, he extended his contract with Munster and the IRFU until 2013. He became the fourth Munster player to win 200 caps in a Celtic League game against Ospreys on 23 April 2011. In May 2011, O&#x27;Gara was part of the Munster team that beat arch-rivals and newly crowned Heineken Cup champions Leinster 19–9 in the 2011 Magners League Grand Final at Thomond Park.

On 12 November 2011, O&#x27;Gara scored an 84th minute drop-goal after 41 phases of play to secure victory for Munster in their opening 2011–12 Heineken Cup Pool One game against Northampton Saints. A week later, in Munster&#x27;s second Pool One game away to Castres Olympique, O&#x27;Gara again scored a match-winning drop-goal, this time in the 81st minute.

On 10 December 2011, O&#x27;Gara became only the second player, the first being his Munster colleague John Hayes, to win 100 caps in the Heineken Cup. He achieved the feat in Munster&#x27;s third pool game, away to Scarlets, which Munster won 14–17, with O&#x27;Gara contributing 12 points with his boot. The following week, O&#x27;Gara scored 14 points in the home tie against Scarlets, helping Munster to a 19–13 victory. He became the most capped Heineken Cup player ever on 14 January 2012, when Munster played Castres in Round 5 of the 2011–12 Heineken Cup, scoring 16 points along the way in a 26–10 win for Munster. In Munster&#x27;s final pool game against Northampton Saints, O&#x27;Gara scored 24 points as Munster won 51–36. O&#x27;Gara announced in March 2012 that he planned to continue playing rugby until he was 38, quashing rumours of his retirement.

On 13 October 2012, O&#x27;Gara scored a penalty and conversion before going off injured in the 34th minute in Munster&#x27;s 22–17 defeat against Racing Métro 92 in their 2012–13 Heineken Cup opener. As a result, O&#x27;Gara missed Munster&#x27;s bonus-point victory against Edinburgh in Round 2, but he returned and scored 15 points in Munster&#x27;s next pool game against Saracens, which saw Munster scrape a win. He became Munster&#x27;s most capped player ever on 5 January 2013, when he won his 233rd cap against Cardiff Blues. O&#x27;Gara was cited and banned for one week after kicking Edinburgh&#x27;s Sean Cox in the Heineken Cup round 4 fixture between the two sides, which ruled him out of Munsters 29–6 victory over Racing Metro which secured qualification from the group stages. He kicked all of Munster&#x27;s points in their 12–18 Heineken Cup quarter-final victory over Harlequins on 7 April 2013. O&#x27;Gara kicked five points for Munster in their 16–10 Heineken Cup semi-final defeat to Clermont Auvergne on 27 April 2013.

On 11 March 2008, O&#x27;Gara was named as Ireland team captain for the first time in his career, leading the side in the Six Nations match against England at Twickenham.
On 14 March 2009, O&#x27;Gara overtook Jonny Wilkinson to become the top Six Nations point scorer ever.

In an interview after Ireland&#x27;s 15–6 World Cup victory over Australia on 17 September 2011, O&#x27;Gara hinted at his possible retirement from international rugby after the conclusion of the World Cup, but subsequently said that his words had been misinterpreted.

===2012–2013===
In the 2012 Six Nations Championship, O&#x27;Gara joined Brian O&#x27;Driscoll as Ireland&#x27;s all-time caps leader (with 117) when he came on against Wales on 5 February 2012, during Ireland&#x27;s opening 2012 Six Nations match.

==Retirement==
After Munster&#x27;s semi-final defeat to ASM Clermont Auvergne in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup, O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s retirement was confirmed on 18 May 2013.

O&#x27;Gara explained his decision to retire: &quot;I have ambitions in the years ahead to coach at a high level and, with this in mind, I can confirm now that I will be joining Racing Métro&#x27;s coaching staff in July. I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? I kind of knew. My lads are gone. My boys in the team are gone.&quot; Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O&#x27;Gara: &quot;In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I&#x27;d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career.&quot;

==Coaching career==
O&#x27;Gara had been offered a one-year contract extension by Munster, but instead decided to take a coaching role with French club Racing 92. Starting in July 2013, O&#x27;Gara worked primarily as a defence coach with Racing. In 2016 he agreed a contract extension with Racing 92 until 2019. Amongst others, O&#x27;Gara coached former Ireland teammate Johnny Sexton, who expressed his delight at being able to work alongside his former Ireland rival. In June 2017, O&#x27;Gara joined the Ireland squad for their one-off test match against the United States as a skills coach.

In November 2017, Racing 92 agreed to release O&#x27;Gara early from his contract, so he could join the Crusaders coaching team in New Zealand. He began as assistant backs coach with the Crusaders on 1 January 2018, and extended his contract for the 2019 Super Rugby season in June 2018. O&#x27;Gara experienced success in his first season in Christchurch, with the Crusaders winning a 9th Super Rugby title, and they defended the title in the 2019 Super Rugby season, securing a record 10th title with a 19–3 win against Argentinian side Jaguares in O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s final match as part of the Crusaders coaching staff.

===La Rochelle===
O&#x27;Gara joined French Top 14 club La Rochelle to replace Xavier Garbajosa as their new head coach upon the conclusion of his duties with the Crusaders 2019 Super Rugby season, in time for the 2019–20 Top 14 season. Jono Gibbes, former Leinster forwards coach and Ulster head coach, was director of rugby at the club at the time.

Following La Rochelle&#x27;s 27–16 away win against Gloucester in the last 16 of the 2020–21 Challenge Cup on 2 April 2021, O&#x27;Gara was interviewed post-match by BT Sport and explained how his rugby philosophy had developed whilst coaching in France and New Zealand, describing how KBA - &quot;Keep Ball Alive&quot; - had become intrinsic to his style of play and mindset as a coach. The interview was widely shared and praised by the rugby media. La Rochelle have also been praised for their astute game management and effective defence during O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s tenure at the club.

O&#x27;Gara signed a new three-year contract with La Rochelle in April 2021, effective until the end of the 2023–24 season. With the news that director of rugby Jono Gibbes had joined rival club Clermont as their new head coach, O&#x27;Gara now oversaw the full spectrum of rugby operations at La Rochelle, whilst also continuing his head coach responsibilities.

O&#x27;Gara faced an LNR disciplinary hearing in November 2021 after he failed to properly register his position on La Rochelle&#x27;s teamsheet for their fixture against Toulon, which meant O&#x27;Gara was not allowed to be present pitch-side during the game, leading to a disagreement, albeit polite, between O&#x27;Gara and the fourth official.

Having lost to rivals Toulouse in the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup final, O&#x27;Gara coached La Rochelle to their first major silverware when they defeated Leinster 24–21 in the 2021–22 Champions Cup final on 28 May 2022.

O&#x27;Gara was banned for six weeks for disrespecting a match official after La Rochelle&#x27;s fixture against Lyon in September 2022, and he faced another LNR disciplinary hearing in November 2022 after being cited for alleged comments made towards a match official; O&#x27;Gara was subsequently banned for ten weeks and fined €20,000, €5,000 of which was suspended.

O&#x27;Gara reunited with his former Crusaders boss Scott Robertson to coach the Barbarians in their fixture against an All Blacks XV on 13 November 2022, which the Barbarians won 35–31. La Rochelle confirmed in December 2022 that O&#x27;Gara had extended his contract with the club until 2027; this followed weeks of speculation that O&#x27;Gara was being considered for the England head coach position. La Rochelle successfully defended their Champions Cup title during the 2022–23 season, coming from seventeen points down to defeat Leinster 27–26 in the Aviva Stadium, Dublin. This achievement meant La Rochelle became only the 5th team to retain the Champions Cup, after Leicester Tigers, Leinster, Toulon and Saracens.

In December 2023, he was given a one-week touchline suspension for his conduct in a defeat to Racing 92. The suspension meant he had to watch La Rochelle&#x27;s Champions Cup group stage fixture against Leinster from the stands, a game they would go on to lose 16-9 at home. It was La Rochelle&#x27;s first ever defeat to Leinster in a Champions Cup fixtures. As of December 2023, he has received a cumulative total of 20 weeks in suspensions from the French authorities.

==Honours and achievements==
Upon his retirement from playing, O&#x27;Gara held a number of honours and achievements at both club and international level. At the time, he had played for Ireland more times than any other player in history and had won nine trophies with Munster.

In May 2016, O&#x27;Gara was inducted into the IRUPA Hall of Fame. In September 2018, O&#x27;Gara was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame, becoming the 12th Irish inductee and inductee number 139 overall.

<text>David John Humphries (6 August 1953 – 15 July 2020) was an English cricketer. He was born in Alveley, Shropshire, and educated at Bridgnorth Olbury Wells School and Wulfrun College, Wolverhampton.

Humphries played county cricket for Leicestershire and Worcestershire, being capped by Worcestershire in 1978. He had also played for Shropshire between 1971 and 1973, being capped in the latter year, while playing at club level for West Bromwich Dartmouth. He appeared Shropshire&#x27;s only Minor Counties Championship win, against Staffordshire at London Road, Shrewsbury in 1973, when he was the highest scorer on his side at 53 runs during the first innings.

His brother Mark Humphries, also a wicket-keeper, played for Minor Counties and Staffordshire.

Humphries died after a long illness on 15 July 2020 at the age of 66.

Humphries was one of ten members of Leicestershire&#x27;s first County Championship winning team in 1975 to have a road in Leicester named after him by the city council. Chris Balderstone, Peter Booth, Brian Davison, Barry Dudleston, Ken Higgs, Ray Illingworth, 
Norman McVicker, John Steele and Roger Tolchard were the others. Jack Birkenshaw, Graham McKenzie and Mick Norman missed out as there were already roads using their surnames.

<doc id="1064031" wikidata="Q14506" url="?curid=1064031" title="Protoceratops">
<text>Protoceratops (; ) is a genus of small protoceratopsid dinosaurs that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous, around 75 to 71 million years ago. The genus &quot;Protoceratops&quot; includes two species: P. andrewsi and the larger P. hellenikorhinus. The former was described in 1923 with fossils from the Mongolian Djadokhta Formation, and the latter in 2001 with fossils from the Chinese Bayan Mandahu Formation. &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was initially believed to be an ancestor of ankylosaurians and larger ceratopsians, such as &quot;Triceratops&quot; and relatives, until the discoveries of other protoceratopsids. Populations of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; may have evolved into &quot;Bagaceratops rozhdestvenskyi&quot; through anagenesis.

&quot;Protoceratops&quot; were small ceratopsians, up to long and around in body mass. While adults were largely quadrupedal, juveniles had the capacity to walk around bipedally if necessary. They were characterized by a proportionally large skull, short and stiff neck, and neck frill. The frill was likely used for display or intraspecific combat, as well as protection of the neck and anchoring of jaw muscles. A horn-like structure was present over the nose, which varied from a single structure in &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; to a double, paired structure in &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;. The &quot;horn&quot; and frill were highly variable in shape and size across individuals of the same species, but there is no evidence of sexual dimorphism. They had a prominent parrot-like beak at the tip of the jaws. &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; had a pair of cylindrical, blunt teeth near the tip of the upper jaw. The forelimbs had five fingers of which only the first three bore wide and flat unguals. The feet were wide and had four toes with flattened, shovel-like unguals, which would have been useful for digging through the sand. The hindlimbs were longer than the forelimbs. The tail was long and had an enigmatic sail-like structure, which may have been used for display, swimming, or metabolic reasons.

&quot;Protoceratops&quot;, like many other ceratopsians, were herbivores equipped with prominent jaws and teeth suited for chopping foliage and other plant material. They are thought to have lived in highly sociable groups of mixed ages. They appear to have cared for their young. They laid soft-shelled eggs, a rare occurrence in dinosaurs. During maturation, the skull and neck frill underwent rapid growth. &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were hunted by &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, and one particularly famous specimen (the Fighting Dinosaurs) preserves a pair of them locked in combat. &quot;Protoceratops&quot; used to be characterized as nocturnal because of the large sclerotic ring around the eye, but they are now thought to have been cathemeral (active at dawn and dusk).

==History of discovery==

In 1900 Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested that Central Asia may have been the center of origin of most animal species, including humans, which caught the attention of explorer and zoologist Roy Chapman Andrews. This idea later gave rise to the First (1916 to 1917), Second (1919) and Third (1921 to 1930) Central Asiatic Expeditions to China and Mongolia, organized by the American Museum of Natural History under the direction of Osborn and field leadership of Andrews. The team of the third expedition arrived in Beijing in 1921 for the final preparations and started working in the field in 1922. During late 1922 the expedition explored the famous Flaming Cliffs of the Shabarakh Usu region of the Djadokhta Formation, Gobi Desert, now known as the Bayn Dzak region. On 2 September, the photographer James B. Shackelford discovered a partial juvenile skull—which would become the holotype specimen (AMNH 6251) of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;—in reddish sandstones. It was subsequently analyzed by the paleontologist Walter W. Granger who identified it as reptilian. On 21 September, the expedition returned to Beijing, and even though it was set up to look for remains of human ancestors, the team collected numerous dinosaur fossils and thus provided insights into the rich fossil record of Asia. Back in Beijing, the skull Shackelford had found was sent to the American Museum of Natural History for further study, after which Osborn reached out to Andrews and team via cable, notifying them about the importance of the specimen.

In 1923 the expedition again prospected the Flaming Cliffs, this time discovering even more specimens of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and also the first remains of &quot;Oviraptor&quot;, &quot;Saurornithoides&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. Most notably, the team discovered the first fossilized dinosaur eggs near the holotype of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; and given how abundant &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was, the nest was attributed to this taxon. This would later result in the interpretation of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; as an egg-thief. In the same year, Granger and William K. Gregory formally described the new genus and species &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot; based on the holotype skull. The specific name, &quot;andrewsi&quot;, is in honor of Andrews for his prominent leadership during the expeditions. They identified &quot;Protoceratops&quot; as an ornithischian dinosaur closely related to ceratopsians representing a possible common ancestor between ankylosaurs and ceratopsians. Since &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was more primitive than any other known ceratopsian at that time, Granger and Gregory coined the new family Protoceratopsidae, mostly characterized by the lack of horns. The co-authors also agreed with Osborn that Asia, if more thoroughly explored, could solve many major evolutionary gaps in the fossil record. Although not stated in the original description, the generic name, &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, is intended to mean &quot;first horned face&quot; as it was believed that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; represented an early ancestor of ceratopsids. Other researchers immediately noted the importance of the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; finds, and the genus was hailed as the &quot;long-sought ancestor of &quot;Triceratops&quot;&quot;. Most fossils were in an excellent state of preservation with even sclerotic rings (delicate ocular bones) preserved in some specimens, quickly making &quot;Protoceratops&quot; one of the best-known dinosaurs from Asia.

After spending much of 1924 making plans for the next fieldwork seasons, in 1925 Andrews and team explored the Flaming Cliffs yet again. During this year more eggs and nests were collected, alongside well-preserved and complete specimens of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. By this time, &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had become one of the most abundant dinosaurs of the region with more than 100 specimens known, including skulls and skeletons of multiple individuals at different growth stages. Though more remains of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were collected in later years of the expeditions, they were most abundant in the 1922 to 1925 seasons. Gregory and Charles C. Mook published another description of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; in 1925, discussing its anatomy and relationships. Thanks to the large collection of skulls found in the expeditions, they concluded that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; represented a ceratopsian more primitive than ceratopsids and not an ankylosaur-ceratopsian ancestor. In 1940, Barnum Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer described the anatomy of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; in extensive detail using newly prepared specimens from the Asiatic expeditions.

In 1963, the Mongolian paleontologist Demberelyin Dashzeveg reported the discovery of a new fossiliferous locality of the Djadokhta Formation: Tugriken Shireh. Like the neighbouring Bayn Dzak, this new locality contained an abundance of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; fossils. During the 1960s to 1970s, Polish-Mongolian and Russian-Mongolian paleontological expeditions collected new, partial to complete specimens of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; at this locality, making this dinosaur species a common occurrence in Tugriken Shireh. Since its discovery, the Tugriken Shireh locality has yielded some of the most significant specimens of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, such as the Fighting Dinosaurs, &quot;in situ&quot; individuals—a preservation condition also known as &quot;standing&quot; individuals or specimens in some cases—, authentic nests, and small herd-like groups. Specimens from this locality are usually found in articulation, suggesting possible mass mortality events.

Stephan N. F. Spiekman and colleagues reported a partial &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; skull (RGM 818207) in the collections of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Netherlands in 2015. Since &quot;Protoceratops&quot; fossils are only found in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and this specimen was likely discovered during the Central Asiatic Expeditions, the team concluded that this skull was probably acquired by Delft University between 1940 and 1972 as part of a collection transfer.

===Species and synonyms===

Protoceratopsid remains were recovered in the 1970s from the Khulsan locality of the Barun Goyot Formation, Mongolia, during the work of several Polish-Mongolian paleontological expeditions. In 1975, Polish paleontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska described a second species of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; which they named &quot;P. kozlowskii&quot;. This new species was based on the Khulsan material, mostly consisting of juvenile skull specimens. The specific name, &quot;kozlowskii&quot;, is in tribute to the Polish paleontologist Roman Kozłowski. They also named the new genus and species of protoceratopsid &quot;Bagaceratops rozhdestvenskyi&quot;, known from specimens of the nearby Hermiin Tsav locality. In 1990 the Russian paleontologist Sergei Mikhailovich Kurzanov referred additional material from Hermiin Tsav to &quot;P. kozlowskii&quot;. However, he noted that there were enough differences between &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; and &quot;P. kozlowskii&quot;, and erected the new genus and combination &quot;Breviceratops kozlowskii&quot;. Though &quot;Breviceratops&quot; has been regarded as a synonym and juvenile stage of &quot;Bagaceratops&quot;, Łukasz Czepiński in 2019 concluded that the former has enough anatomical differences to be considered as a separate taxon.

In 2001 Oliver Lambert with colleagues named a new and distinct species of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;. The first known remains of &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; were collected from the Bayan Mandahu locality of the Bayan Mandahu Formation, Inner Mongolia, in 1995 and 1996 during Sino-Belgian paleontological expeditions. The holotype (IMM 95BM1/1) and paratype (IMM 96BM1/4) specimens consist of large skulls lacking body remains. The holotype skull was found facing upwards, a pose that has been reported in &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimens from Tugriken Shireh. The specific name, &quot;hellenikorhinus&quot;, is derived from Greek hellenikos (meaning Greek) and rhis (meaning nose) in reference to its broad and angular snout, which is reminiscent of the straight profiles of Greek sculptures. In 2017 abundant protoceratopsid material was reported from Alxa near Bayan Mandahu, and it may be preferable to &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;.

Viktor Tereshchenko and Vladimir R. Alifanov in 2003 named a new protoceratopsid dinosaur from the Bayn Dzak locality, &quot;Bainoceratops efremovi &quot;. This genus was based on a few dorsal (back) vertebrae that were stated to differ from those of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. In 2006 North American paleontologists Peter Makovicky and Mark A. Norell suggested that &quot;Bainoceratops&quot; may be synonymous with &quot;Protoceratops&quot; as most of the traits used to separate the former from the latter have been reported from other ceratopsians including &quot;Protoceratops&quot; itself, and they are more likely to fall within the wide intraspecific variation range of the concurring &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;. The authors Brenda J. Chinnery and Jhon R. Horner in 2007 during their description of &quot;Cerasinops&quot; stated that &quot;Bainoceratops&quot;, along with other dubious genera, was determined to be either a variant or immature specimen of other genera. Based on this reasoning, they excluded &quot;Bainoceratops&quot; from their phylogenetic analysis.

===Eggs and nests===

As part of the Third Central Asiatic Expedition of 1923, Andrews and team discovered the holotype specimen of &quot;Oviraptor&quot; in association with some of the first known fossilized dinosaur eggs (nest AMNH 6508), in the Djadokhta Formation. Each egg was elongated and hard-shelled, and due to the proximity and high abundance of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; in the formation, these eggs were believed at the time to belong to this dinosaur. This resulted in the interpretation of the contemporary &quot;Oviraptor&quot; as an egg predatory animal, an interpretation also reflected in its generic name. In 1975, the Chinese paleontologist Zhao Zikui named the new oogenera &quot;Elongatoolithus&quot; and &quot;Macroolithus&quot;, including them in a new oofamily: the Elongatoolithidae. As the name implies, they represent elongated dinosaur eggs, including some of referred ones to &quot;Protoceratops&quot;.

In 1994 the Russian paleontologist Konstantin E. Mikhailov named the new oogenus &quot;Protoceratopsidovum&quot; from the Barun Goyot and Djadokhta formations, with the type species &quot;P. sincerum&quot; and additional &quot;P. fluxuosum&quot; and &quot;P. minimum&quot;. This ootaxon was firmly stated as belonging to protoceratopsid dinosaurs since they were the predominant dinosaurs where the eggs were found and some skeletons of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were found in close proximity to &quot;Protoceratopsidovum&quot; eggs. More specifically, Mikhailov stated that &quot;P. sincerum&quot; and &quot;P. minimum&quot; were laid by &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, and &quot;P. fluxuosum&quot; by &quot;Breviceratops&quot;.

However, also during 1994, Norell and colleagues reported and briefly described a fossilized theropod embryo inside an egg (MPC-D 100/971) from the Djadokhta Formation. They identified this embryo as an oviraptorid dinosaur and the eggshell, upon close examination, turned out be that of elongatoolithid eggs and thereby the oofamily Elongatoolithidae was concluded to represent the eggs of oviraptorids. This find proved that the nest AMNH 6508 belonged to &quot;Oviraptor&quot; and rather than an egg-thief, the holotype was actually a mature individual that perished brooding the eggs. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses published in 2008 by Darla K. Zelenitsky and François Therrien have shown that &quot;Protoceratopsidovum&quot; represents the eggs of a maniraptoran more derived than oviraptorids and not &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. The description of the eggshell of &quot;Protoceratopsidovum&quot; has further confirmed that they in fact belong to a maniraptoran, possibly deinonychosaur taxon.

Nevertheless, in 2011 an authentic nest of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was reported and described by David E. Fastovsky and colleagues. The nest (MPC-D 100/530) containing 15 articulated juveniles was collected from the Tugriken Shireh locality of the Djadokhta Formation during the work of Mongolian-Japanese paleontological expeditions. Gregory M. Erickson and team in 2017 reported an embryo-bearing egg clutch (MPC-D 100/1021) of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; from the also fossiliferous Ukhaa Tolgod locality, discovered during paleontological expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History and Mongolian Academy of Sciences. This clutch comprises at least 12 eggs and embryos with only 6 embryos preserving nearly complete skeletons. Norell with colleagues in 2020 examined fossilized remains around the eggs of this clutch which indicate a soft-shelled composition.

===Fighting Dinosaurs===

The Fighting Dinosaurs specimen preserves a &quot;Protoceratops&quot; (MPC-D 100/512) and &quot;Velociraptor&quot; (MPC-D 100/25) fossilized in combat and provides an important window regarding direct evidence of predator-prey behavior in non-avian dinosaurs. In the 1960s and early 1970s, many Polish-Mongolian paleontological expeditions were conducted to the Gobi Desert with the objective of fossil findings. In 1971, the expedition explored several localities of the Djadokhta and Nemegt formations. During fieldwork on 3 August several fossils of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot; were found at the Tugriken Shire locality (Djadokhta Formation) including a block containing one of each. The individuals in this block were identified as a &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; and &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot;. Although the conditions surrounding their burial were not fully understood, it was clear that they died simultaneously in a struggle.

The specimen, nicknamed the &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot;, has been examined and studied by numerous researchers and paleontologists, and there are various opinions on how the animals were buried and preserved altogether. Though a drowning scenario has been proposed by Barsbold, such a hypothesis is considered unlikely given the arid paleoenvironments of the Djadokhta Formation. It is generally thought that they were buried alive by a sandstorm or a collapsed dune.

===Skin impressions and footprints===

During the Third Central Asiatic Expedition in 1923, a nearly complete &quot;Protoceratops&quot; skeleton (specimen AMNH 6418) was collected at the Flaming Cliffs. Unlike other specimens, it was discovered in a rolled-up position with its skull preserving a thin, hard, and wrinkled layer of matrix (surrounding sediments). This specimen was later described in 1940 by Brown and Schlaikjer, who discussed the nature of the matrix portion. They stated that this layer had a very skin-like texture and covered mostly the left side of the skull from the snout to the neck frill. Brown and Schlaikjer discarded the idea of possible skin impressions as this skin-like layer was likely a product of the decay and burial of the individual, making the sediments become highly attached to the skull.

The potential importance of these remains were unrecognized or given attention, and by 2020 the specimen has already been completely prepared losing all traces of this skin-like layer. Some elements were damaged in the process such as the rostrum. In 2022 Phil R. Bell and colleagues briefly described these potential soft tissues based on the photographs provided by Brown and Schlaikjer, as well as other ceratopsian soft tissues. However, although the initial perception was that the entire skin-like layer had been removed, photographs shared by Czepiński during the same year have revealed that the right side of the skull remains intact, retaining much of this layer and pending further analysis.

Also from the context of the Polish-Mongolian paleontological expeditions, in 1965 an articulated subadult &quot;Protoceratops&quot; skeleton (specimen ZPAL Mg D-II/3) was collected from the Bayn Dzak locality of the Djadokhta Formation. In the 2000s during the preparation of the specimen, a fossilized cast of a four-toed digitigrade footprint was found below the pelvic girdle. This footprint was described in 2012 by Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki and colleagues who considered it to represent one of the first reported finds of a dinosaur footprint in association with an articulated skeleton, and also the first one reported for &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. The limb elements of the skeleton of ZPAL Mg D-II/3 were described in 2019 by paleontologists Justyna Słowiak, Victor S. Tereshchenko and Łucja Fostowicz-Frelik. Tereshchenko in 2021 fully described the axial skeleton of this specimen.

==Description==

&quot;Protoceratops&quot; was a relatively small-sized ceratopsian, with both &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; and &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; estimated up to in length, and around in body mass. Although similar in overall body size, the latter had a relatively greater skull length. Both species can be differentiated by the following characteristics:

* P. andrewsi – Two teeth were present at the premaxilla; the snout was low and long; the nasal horn was a single, pointed structure; the bottom edge of the dentary was slightly curved.
* P. hellenikorhinus – Absence of premaxillary teeth; the snout was tall and broad; the nasal horn was divided into two pointed ridges; the bottom edge of the dentary was straight.

===Skull===

The skull of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was relatively large compared to its body and robustly built. The skull of the type species, &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;, had an average total length of nearly . On the other hand &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; had a total skull length of about . The rear of the skull gave form to a pronounced neck frill (also known as &quot;parietal frill&quot;) mostly composed of the and bones. The exact size and shape of the frill varied by individual; some had short, compact frills, while others had frills nearly half the length of the skull. The squamosal touched the (cheekbone) and was very enlarged and high having a curved end that built the borders of the frill. The parietals were the posteriormost bones of the skull and major elements of the frill. In a top view they had a triangular shape and were joined by the (bones of the skull roof). Both parietals were coossified (fused), creating a long ridge on the center of the frill. The jugal was deep and sharply developed and along with the they formed a horn-like extension that pointed to below at the lateral sides of the skull. The (tip region of the jugal) was separated from the jugal by a prominent suture; this suture was more noticeable in adults. The surfaces around the epijugal were coarse, indicating that it was covered by a horny sheath. Unlike the much derived ceratopsids, the frontal and postorbital bones of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were flat and lacked horn cores or supraorbital horns. The (small spur-like bone) joined the prefrontal over the front of the orbit (eye socket). In &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; the palpebral protruded upwards from the , just above the orbit and slightly meeting the frontal, creating a small horn-like structure. The was a near-rectangular bone located in front of the orbit, contributing to the shape of the latter. The sclerotic ring (structure that supports the eyeball), found inside the orbit, was circular in shape and formed by consecutive bony plates.

The snout was formed by the , r, r and bones. The nasal was generally rounded but some individuals had a sharp nasal boss (a feature that has been called &quot;nasal horn&quot;). In &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; this boss was divided in two sharp and long ridges. The maxilla was very deep and had up to 15 alveoli (tooth sockets) on its underside or teeth bearing surface. The premaxilla had two alveoli on its lower edge—a character that was present at least on &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;. The rostral bone was devoid of teeth, high and triangular in shape. It had a sharp end and rough texture, which reflects that a rhamphotheca (horny beak) was present. As a whole, the skull had four pairs of fenestrae (skull openings). The foremost hole, the nares (nostril opening), was oval-shaped and considerably smaller than the nostrils seen in ceratopsids. &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had large orbits, which measured around in diameter and had irregular shapes depending on the individual. The forward facing and closely located orbits combined with a narrow snout, gave &quot;Protoceratops&quot; a well-developed binocular vision. Behind the eye was a slightly smaller fenestra known as the infratemporal fenestra, formed by the curves of the jugal and squamosal. The last openings of the skull were two parietal fenestrae (holes in the frill).

The lower jaw of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was a large element composed of the , , , and . The predentary (frontmost bone) was very pointed and elongated, having a V-shaped symphyseal (bone union) region at the front. The dentary (teeth-bearing bone) was robust, deep, slightly recurved, and fused to the angular and surangular. A large and thick ridge ran along the lateral surface of the dentary that connected the coronoid process—a bony projection that extends upwards from the upper surface of the lower jaw behind the tooth row—and surangular. It bore up to 12–14 alveoli on its top margin. Both predentary and dentary had a series of foramina (small pits), the latter mostly on its anterior end. The coronoid (highest point of the lower jaw) was blunt-shaped and touched by the coronoid process of the dentary, being obscured by the jugal. The surangular was near triangular in shape and in old individuals it was coossified together with the coronoid process. The angular was located below the two latter bones and behind the dentary. It was a large and somewhat rounded bone that complemented the curvature of the dentary. On its inner surface it was attached to the . The articular was a smaller bone and had a concavity on its inner surface for the articulation with the quadrate.

&quot;Protoceratops&quot; had leaf-shaped dentary and maxillary teeth that bore several denticles (serrations) on their respective edges. The crowns (upper exposed part) had two faces or lobes that were divided by a central ridge-like structure (also called &quot;primary ridge&quot;). The teeth were packed into a single row that created a shearing surface. Both dentary and maxillary teeth presented marked homodonty—a dental condition where the teeth share a similar shape and size. &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; bore two small, peg to spike-like teeth that were located on the underside of each premaxilla. The second premaxillary tooth was larger than the first one. Unlike dentary and maxillary teeth, the premaxillary dentition was devoid of denticles, having a relatively smooth surface. All teeth had a single root (lower part inserted in the alveoli).

===Postcranial skeleton===
The vertebral column of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had nine cervical (neck), 12 dorsal (back), eight sacral (pelvic) and over 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The centra (centrum; body of the vertebrae) of the first three cervicals were coossified together (, and third cervical respectively) creating a rigid structure. The neck was rather short and had poor flexibility. The atlas was the smallest cervical and consisted mainly of the centrum because the (upper, and pointy vertebral region) was a thin, narrow bar of bone that extended upwards and backward to the base of the axis neural . The capitular facet (attachment site for chevrons; also known as cervical ribs) was formed by a low projection located near the base of the neural arch. The anterior facet of the atlas centrum was highly concave for the articulation of the of the skull. The neural arch and spine of the axis were notably larger than the atlas itself and any other cervical. The axial neural spine was broad and backward developed being slightly connected to that of the third cervical. From the fourth to the ninth all cervicals were relatively equal in size and proportions. Their neural spines were smaller than the first three vertebrae and the development of the capitular facet diminished from the fourth cervical onwards.

The were similar in shape and size. Their neural spines were elongated and sub-rectangular in shape with a tendency to become more elongated in posterior vertebrae. The centra were large and predominantly amphiplatian (flat on both facets) and circular when seen from the front. Sometimes in old individuals the last dorsal vertebra was somewhat coosified to the first sacral. The were firmly coosified giving form to the sacrum, which was connected to the inner sides of both ilia. Their neural spines were broad, not coosified, and rather consistent in length. The centra were mainly opisthocoelous (concave on the posterior facet and convex on the anterior one) and their size became smaller towards the end. The decreased in size progressively towards the end and had very elongated neural spines in the mid-series, forming a sail-like structure. This elongation started from the first to the fourteenth caudal. The centra were (saddle-shaped at both facets). On the anterior caudals they were broad, however, from the twenty-fifth onwards the centra became elongated alongside the neural spines. On the underside of the caudal vertebrae a series of chevrons were attached, giving form to the lower part of the tail. The first chevron was located at the union of the third and fourth caudals. Chevrons three to nine were the largest and from the tenth onwards they became smaller.

All vertebrae of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had ribs attached on the lateral sides, except for the series of caudals. The first five cervical ribs (sometimes called chevrons) were some of the shortest ribs, and among them the first two were longer than the rest. The third to the sixth dorsal (thoracic) ribs were the longest ribs in the skeleton of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, the following ribs became smaller in size as they progressed toward the end of the vertebral column. The two last dorsal ribs were the smallest, and the last of them was in contact with the internal surfaces of the ilium. Most of the sacral ribs were fused into the sacrum, and had a rather curved shape.

The pectoral girdle of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was formed by the (fusion of the coracoid and scapula) and clavicle. The (shoulder blades) were relatively large and rounded on their inner sides. At their upper region, the scapulae were wide. At their lower region, the scapulae meet the coracoids. The were relatively elliptical, and sometimes coosified (fused) to the scapulae. The clavicle of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was an U to slightly V-shaped element that joined to the upper border of the scapulocoracoid. In its general form, the forelimbs of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were shorted than the hindlimbs, and composed by the humerus, radius, and ulna. The (upper arm bone) was large and slender, and at the lower part it met with both radius and ulna. The had a slightly recurved shape and was longer than the radius. A concavity was present on its upper part, serving as the connection with the humerus and forming the elbow. The was a rather short bone with a straight shape. The manus (hand) of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had five digits (fingers). The first three fingers had unguals (claw bones) and were the largest digits. The last two were devoid of unguals and had a small size, mostly vestigial (retained, but without important function). Both hand and feet unguals were flat, blunt and hoof-like.

The pelvic girdle was formed by the , , and . The ilium was a large element, having a narrow preacetabular process (anterior end) and a wide postacetabular process (posterior end). The pubis was the smallest element of the pelvic girdle and it had an irregular shape, although its lower end was developed into a pointed bony projection downward. The ischium was the longest bone of the pelvic girdle. It had an elongated shaft with a somewhat wide lower end. The hindlimbs of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were rather long, with a slighter longer tibia (lower leg bone) than femur (thigh bone). The (thighbone) was robust and had a rather rounded and pronounced greater trochanter, which was slightly recurved into the inner sides. The (shinbone) was long and slender with a wide lower end. On its upper region a concavity was developed for the joint with the smaller . The pes (foot) were composed of four and four toes which bore shovel-like pedal unguals. The first metatarsal and toe were the smallest, while the other elements were of similar shape and length.

==Classification==

&quot;Protoceratops&quot; was in 1923 placed within the newly named family Protoceratopsidae as the representative species by Granger and Gregory. This family was characterized by their overall primitive morphology in comparison to the more derived Ceratopsidae, such as lack of well-developed horn cores and relative smaller body size. &quot;Protoceratops&quot; itself was considered by the authors to be somehow related to ankylosaurians based on skull traits, with a more intensified degree to &quot;Triceratops&quot; and relatives. Gregory and Charles C. Mook in 1925 upon a more deeper analysis of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and its overall morphology, concluded that this taxon represents a ceratopsian more primitive than ceratopsids and not an ankylosaur-ceratopsian ancestor. In 1951 Edwin H. Colbert considered &quot;Protoceratops&quot; to represent a key ancestor for the ceratopsid lineage, suggesting that it ultimately led to the evolution of large-bodied ceratopsians such as &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot;. Such lineage was suggested to have started from the primitive ceratopsian &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot;. He also regarded &quot;Protoceratops&quot; as one of the first &quot;frilled&quot; ceratopsians to appear in the fossil record.

However, in 1975 Maryanska and Osmolska argued that it is very unlikely that protoceratopsids evolved from psittacosaurids, and also unlikely that they gave rise to the highly derived (advanced) ceratopsids. The first point was supported by the numerous anatomical differences between protoceratopsids and psittacosaurids, most notably the extreme reduction of some hand digits in the latter group—a trait much less pronounced in protoceratopsids. The second point was explained on the basis of the already derived anatomy in protoceratopsids like &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; or &quot;Protoceratops&quot; (such as the jaw morphology). Maryanska and Osmolska also emphasized that some early members of the Ceratopsidae reflect a much older evolutionary history. In 1998, paleontologist Paul Sereno formally defined Protoceratopsidae as the branch-based clade including all coronosaurs closer to &quot;Protoceratops&quot; than to &quot;Triceratops&quot;.

Furthermore, with the re-examinations of &quot;Turanoceratops&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Zuniceratops&quot;—two critical ceratopsian taxa regarding the evolutionary history of ceratopsids—in 2010 it was concluded that the origin of ceratopsids is unrelated to, and older than the fossil record of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and relatives. In most recent/modern phylogenetic analyses &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; are commonly recovered as sister taxa, leaving the interpretations proposing direct relationships with more derived ceratopsians unsupported.

In 2019 Czepiński analyzed a vast majority of referred specimens to the ceratopsians &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; and &quot;Breviceratops&quot;, and concluded that most were in fact specimens of the former. Although the genera &quot;Gobiceratops&quot;, &quot;Lamaceratops&quot;, &quot;Magnirostris&quot;, and &quot;Platyceratops&quot;, were long considered valid and distinct taxa, and sometimes placed within Protoceratopsidae, Czepiński found the diagnostic (identifier) features used to distinguish these taxa to be largely present in &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; and thus becoming synonyms of this genus. Under this reasoning, Protoceratopsidae consists of &quot;Bagaceratops&quot;, &quot;Breviceratops&quot;, and &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. Below are the proposed relationships among Protoceratopsidae by Czepiński:
In 2019 Bitnara Kim and colleagues described a relatively well-preserved &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; skeleton from the Barun Goyot Formation, noting numerous similarities with &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. Even though their respective skull anatomy had substantial differences, their postcranial skeleton was virtually the same. The phylogenetic analysis performed by the team recovered both protoceratopsids as sister taxa, indicating that &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were anatomically and systematically related. Below is the obtained cladogram, showing the position of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and &quot;Bagaceratops&quot;:

===Evolution===

Longrich and team in 2010 indicated that highly derived morphology of &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;—when compared to &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;—indicates that this species may represent a lineage of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; that had a longer evolutionary history compared to &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;, or simply a direct descendant of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;. The difference in morphologies between &quot;Protoceratops&quot; also suggests that the nearby Bayan Mandahu Formation is slightly younger than the Djadokhta Formation.

In 2020, Czepiński analyzed several long-undescribed protoceratopsid specimens from the Udyn Sayr and Zamyn Khondt localities of the Djadokhta Formation. One specimen (MPC-D 100/551B) was shown to present skull traits that are intermediate between &quot;Bagaceratops rozhdestvenskyi&quot; (which is native to adjacent Bayan Mandahu and Barun Goyot) and &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;. The specimen hails from the Udyn Sayr locality, where &quot;Protoceratops&quot; remains are dominant, and given the lack of more conclusive anatomical traits, Czepiński assigned the specimen as &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; sp. He explained that the presence of this &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; specimen in such unusual locality could be solved by: (1) the coexistence and sympatric (altogether) evolution of both &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; at this one locality; (2) the rise of &quot;B. rozhdestvenskyi&quot; in a different region and eventual migration to Udyn Sayr; (3) hybridization between the two protoceratopsids given the near placement of both Bayan Mandahu and Djadokhta; (4) anagenetic (progressive evolution) evolutionary transition from &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; to &quot;B. rozhdestvenskyi&quot;. Among scenarios, an anagenetic transition was best supported by Czepiński given the fact that no definitive &quot;B. rozhdestvenskyi&quot; fossils are found in Udyn Sayr, as expected from a hybridization event; MPC-D 100/551B lacks a well-developed accessory antorbital fenestra (hole behind the nostril openings), a trait expected to be present if &quot;B. rozhdestvenskyi&quot; had migrated to the area; and many specimens of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; recovered at Udyn Sayr already feature a decrease in the presence of primitive premaxillary teeth, hence supporting a growing change in the populations.

==Paleobiology==
===Feeding===
In 1955, paleontologist Georg Haas examined the overall skull shape of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and attempted to reconstruct its jaw musculature. He suggested that the large neck frill was likely an attachment site for masticatory muscles. Such placement of the muscles may have helped to anchor the lower jaws, useful for feeding. Yannicke Dauphin and colleagues in 1988 described the enamel microstructure of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, observing a non-prismatic outer layer. They concluded that enamel shape does not relate to the diet or function of the teeth as most animals do not necessarily use teeth to process food. The maxillary teeth of ceratopsians were usually packed into a dental battery that formed vertical shearing blades which probably chopped the leaves. This feeding method was likely more efficient in protoceratopsids as the enamel surface of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was coarsely-textured and the tips of the micro-serrations developed on the basis of the teeth, probably helping to crumble vegetation. Based on their respective peg-like shape and reduced microornamentation, Dauphin and colleagues suggested that the premaxillary teeth of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had no specific function.

In 1991, the paleontologist Gregory S. Paul stated that contrary to the popular view of ornithischians as obligate herbivores, some groups may have been opportunistic meat-eaters, including the members of Ceratopsidae and Protoceratopsidae. He pointed out that their prominent parrot-like beaks and shearing teeth along with powerful muscles on the jaws suggest an omnivore diet instead, much like pigs, hogs, boars and entelodonts. Such scenario indicates a possible competition with the more predatory theropods over carcasses, however, as the animal tissue ingestion was occasional and not the bulk of their diet, the energy flow in ecosystems was relatively simple. You Hailu and Peter Dodson in 2004 suggested that the premaxillary teeth of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have been useful for selective cropping and feeding.

In 2009, Kyo Tanque and team suggested that basal ceratopsians, such as protoceratopsids, were most likely low browsers due to their relatively small body size. This low-browsing method would have allowed to feed on foliage and fruits within range, and large basal ceratopsians may have consumed tougher seeds or plant material not available to smaller basal ceratopsians.

David J. Button and Lindsay E. Zanno in 2019 performed a large phylogenetic analysis based on skull biomechanical characters—provided by 160 Mesozoic dinosaur species—to analyze the multiple emergences of herbivory among non-avian dinosaurs. Their results found that herbivorous dinosaurs mainly followed two distinct modes of feeding, either processing food in the gut—characterized by relatively gracile skulls and low bite forces—or the mouth, which was characterized by features associated with extensive processing such as high bite forces and robust jaw musculature. Ceratopsians (including protoceratopsids), along with &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, &quot;Hungarosaurus&quot;, parkosaurid, ornithopod and heterodontosaurine dinosaurs, were found to be in the former category, indicating that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and relatives had strong bite forces and relied mostly on its jaws to process food.

===Ontogeny===

Brown and Schlaikjer in 1940 upon their large description and revision of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; remarked that the orbits, frontals, and lacrimals suffered a shrinkage in relative size as the animal aged; the top border of the nostrils became more vertical; the nasal bones progressively became elongated and narrowed; and the neck frill as a whole also increases in size with age. The neck frill specifically, underwent a dramatic change from a small, flat, and almost rounded structure in juveniles to a large, fan-like one in fully mature &quot;Protoceratops&quot; individuals. In 2001, Lambert and colleagues considered the development of the two nasal &quot;horns&quot; of &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; to be a trait that was delayed in relation to the appearance of sexual-discriminant traits. This was based on the fact that one small specimen (IMM 96BM2/1) has a skull size slightly larger than a presumed sexually mature &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; skull (AMNH 6409), and yet it lacks double nasal horns present in fully mature &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;.

Makovicky and team in 2007 conducted a histological analysis on several specimens of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; from the American Museum of Natural History collections to provide insights into the life history of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. The examined fossil bones indicated that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; slowed its ontogeny (growth) around 9–10 years of life, and it ceased around 11–13 years. They also observed that the maximum or latest stage of development of the neck frill and nasal horn occurred in the oldest &quot;Protoceratops&quot; individuals, indicating that such traits were ontogenically variable (meaning that they varied with age). Makovicky and team also stated that as the maximum/radical changes on the neck frill and nasal horn were present in most adult individuals, trying to differentiate sexual dimorphism (anatomical differences between sexes) in adult &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may not be a good practice.

David Hone and colleagues in 2016 upon their analysis of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; neck frills, found that the frill of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was disproportionally smaller in juveniles, grew at a rapid rate than the rest of the animal during its ontogeny, and reached a considerable size only in large adult individuals. Other changes during ontogeny include the elongation of the premaxillary teeth that are smaller in juveniles and enlarged in adults, and the enlargement of middle neural spines in the tail or caudal vertebrae, which appear to grow much taller when approaching adulthood.

In 2017, Mototaka Saneyoshi with team analyzed several &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimens from the Djadokhta Formation, noting that from perinate/juvenile to subadult individuals, the parietal and squamosal bones increased their sides to posterior sides of the skull. From subadult to adult individuals, the squamosal bone increased in size more than the parietal bone, and the frill expanded to a top direction. The team concluded that the frill of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; can be characterized by these ontogenetic changes.

In 2018, paleontologists Łucja Fostowicz-Frelik and Justyna Słowiak studied the bone histology of several specimens of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; through cross-sections, in order to analyze the growth changes in this dinosaur. The sampled elements consisted of neck frill, femur, tibia, fibula, ribs, humerus and radius bones, and showed that the histology of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; remained rather uniform throughout ontogeny. It was characterized by simple fibrolamellar bone—bony tissue with an irregular, fibrous texture and filled with blood vessels—with prominent woven-fibered bone and low bone remodeling. Most bones of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; preserve a large abundance of bone fibers (including Sharpey&#x27;s fibres), which likely gave strength to the organ and enhanced its elasticity. The team also find that the growth rate of the femur increased at the subadult stage, suggesting changes in bone proportions, such as the elongation of the hindlimbs. This growth rate is mostly similar to that of other small herbivorous dinosaurs such as primitive &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; or &quot;Scutellosaurus&quot;.

===Movement===

In 1996, Tereshchenko reconstructed the walking model of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; where he considered the most likely scenario to be &quot;Protoceratops&quot; as an obligate quadruped given the proportions of its limbs. The main gait of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was probably trot-like mostly using its hindlimbs and it is unlikely to have used an asymmetric gait. If trapped in a specific situation (like danger or foraging), &quot;Protoceratops&quot; could have employed a rapid, facultative bipedalism. He also noted that the flat and wide pedal unguals of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have allowed efficient walking through loose terrain, such as sand which was common on its surroundings. Tereshchenko using speed equations also estimated the average maximum walking speed of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; at about 3 km/h (kilometres per hour).

Upon the analysis of the forelimbs of several ceratopsians, Phil Senter in 2007 suggested that the hands of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; could reach the ground when the hindlimbs were upright, and the overall forelimb morphology and range of motion may reflect that it was at least a facultative (optional) quadruped. The forelimbs of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; could sprawl laterally but not for quadrupedal locomotion, which was accomplished with the elbows tucked in. In 2010 Alexander Kuznetsov and Tereshchenko analyzed several vertebrae series of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; to estimate overall mobility, and concluded that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had greater lateral mobility in the presacral (pre-hip) vertebrae series and reduced vertical mobility in the cervical (neck) region. The fossilized footprint associated with the specimen ZPAL Mg D-II/3 described by Niedźwiedzki in 2012 indicates that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was digitigrade, meaning that it walked with its toes supporting the body weight.

In 2019 however, Słowiak and team described the limb elements of ZPAL Mg D-II/3, which represents a sub-adult individual, and noted a mix of characters typical of bipedal ceratopsians such as a narrow glenoid with scapular blade and an arched femur. The absence of these traits in mature individuals indicates that young &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were capable of facultative bipedal locomotion and adults had an obligate quadrupedal stance. Even though adult &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were stocky and quadruped, their tibia-femur length ratio—the tibia being longer than femur, a trait present in bipedal ceratopsians—suggests the ability to occasionally stand on their hindlimbs. Słowiak and team also suggested that the flat and wide hand unguals (claw bone) of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have been useful for moving on loose terrain (such as sand) without sinking.

===Digging behavior===

Longrich in 2010 proposed that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have used its hindlimbs to dig burrows or take shelter under bushes and/or scrapes to escape the hottest temperatures of the day. A digging action with the hindlimbs was likely facilitated by the strong caudofemoralis muscle and its large feet equipped with flat, shovel-like unguals. As this behavior would have been common in &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, it predisposed individuals to become entombed alive during the sudden collapse of their burrows and high energy sand-bearing events—such as sandstorms—and thus explaining the standing &quot;in-situ&quot; posture of some specimens. Additionally, Longrich suggested that a backward burrowing could explain the preservation of some specimens pointing forward with curved tails.

In 2019, Victoria M. Arbour and David C. Evans cited the robusticity of the ulna of &quot;Ferrisaurus&quot; as a useful feature for digging, which may have been also true for &quot;Protoceratops&quot;.

===Tail function===

Gregory and Mook in 1925 suggested that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was partially aquatic because of its large feet—being larger than the hands—and the very long neural spines found in the caudal (tail) vertebrae. Brown and Schlaikjer in 1940 indicated that the expansion of the distal (lower) ischial end may reflect a strong ischiocaudalis muscle, which together with the high tail neural spines were used for swimming. Barsbold in his brief 1974 description of the Fighting Dinosaurs specimen accepted this hypothesis and suggested that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was amphibious (water-adapted) and had well-developed swimming capacities based on its side to side flattened tail with very high neural spines.

Jack Bowman Bailey in 1997 disagreed with previous aquatic hypotheses and indicated that the high caudal neural spines were instead more reminiscent of bulbous tails of some desert lizard species (such as &quot;Heloderma&quot; or &quot;Uromastyx&quot;), which are related to store fat with metabolic water in the tail. He considered a swimming adaptation unlikely given the arid settings of the Djadokhta Formation.

In 2008, based on the occurrence of some &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimens in fluvial (river-deposited) sediments from the Djadokhta Formation and (vertebral centra that are saddle-shaped at both ends) caudal vertebrae of protoceratopsids, Tereshchenko concluded that the elevated caudal spines are a swimming adaptation. He proposed that protoceratopsids moved through water using their laterally-flattened tails as a paddle to aid in swimming. According to Tereschenko, &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; was fully aquatic while &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was only partially aquatic. Longrich in 2010 argued that the high tail and frill of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have helped it to shed excess heat during the day—acting as large-surface structures—when the animal was active in order to survive in the relatively arid environments of the Djadokhta Formation without highly developed cooling mechanisms.

In 2011, during the description of &quot;Koreaceratops&quot;, Yuong-Nam Lee and colleagues found the above swimming hypotheses hard to prove based on the abundance of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; in eolian (wind-deposited) sediments that were deposited in prominent arid environments. They also pointed out that while taxa such as &quot;Leptoceratops&quot; and &quot;Montanoceratops&quot; are recovered from fluvial sediments, they are estimated to be some of the poorest swimmers. Lee and colleagues concluded that even though the tail morphology of &quot;Koreaceratops&quot;—and other basal ceratopsians—does not argues against swimming habits, the cited evidence for it is insufficient.

Tereschhenko in 2013 examined the structure of the caudal vertebrae spines of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, concluding that it had adaptations for terrestrial and aquatic habits. Observations made found that the high number of caudal vertebrae may have been useful for swimming and use the tail to counter-balance weight. He also indicated that the anterior caudals were devoid of high neural spines and had increased mobility—a mobility that stars to decrease towards the high neural spines—, which suggest that the tail could be largely raised from its base. It is likely that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; raised its tail as a signal (display) or females could use this method during egg laying to expand and relax the cloaca.

In 2016, Hone and team indicated that the tail of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, particularly the mid region with elevated neural spines, could have been used in display to impress potential mates and/or for species recognition. The tail may have been related with structures like the frill for displaying behavior.

Kim with team in 2019 cited the elongated tail spines as well-suited for swimming. They indicated that both &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have used their tails in a similar fashion during similar situations, such as swimming, given how similar their postcranial skeletons were. The team also suggested that a swimming adaptation could have been useful to avoid aquatic predators, such as crocodylomorphs.

===Social behavior===

Tomasz Jerzykiewiczz in 1993 reported several monospecific (containing only one dominant species) death assemblages of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; from the Bayan Mandahu and Djadokhta formations. A group of five medium-sized and adult &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was observed at the Bayan Mandahu locality. Individuals within this assemblage were lying on their bellies with their heads facing upwards, side by side parallel-aligned, and inclined about 21 degrees from the horizontal plane. Two other groups were found at the Tugriken Shireh locality; one group containing six individuals and another group of about 12 skeletons.

In 2014, David W. E. Hone and colleagues reported and described two blocks containing death assemblages of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; from Tugriken Shireh. The first block (MPC-D 100/526) comprises four juvenile individuals in close proximity with their heads pointing upwards, and the second block (MPC-D 100/534) is composed of two sub-adults with a horizontal orientation. Based on previous assemblages and the two blocks, the team determined that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was a social dinosaur that formed herds throughout its life and such herds would have varied in composition, with some including adults, sub-adults, siblings from a single nest or local members of a herd joining shortly after hatching. However, as the group could have loss members by predation or other factors, the remnants individuals would aggregate into larger groups to increase their survival. Hone and colleagues in particular suggested that juveniles would aggregate primarily as a defense against predators and an increased protection from the multiple adults within the group. The team also indicated that, while &quot;Protoceratops&quot; provides direct evidence for the formation of single cohort aggregations throughout its lifespan, it cannot be ruled out the possibility that some &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were solitary.

===Sexual dimorphism and display===

Brown and Schlaikjer in 1940 upon their large analysis of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; noted the potential presence of sexual dimorphism among specimens in &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;, concluding that this condition could be entirely subjective or represent actual differences between sexes. Individuals with a high nasal horn, massive prefrontals, and frontoparietal depression were tentatively determined as males. Females were mostly characterized by the lack of well-developed nasal horns. In 1972 Kurzanov made comparisons between &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; skulls from Bayn Dzak and Tugriken Shireh, noting differences on the nasal horn within populations.

Peter Dodson in 1996 used anatomical characters of the skull in &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; to quantify areas subject to ontogenic changes and sexual dimorphism. In total, 40 skull characters were measured and compared, including regions like the frill and nasal horn. Dodson found most of these characters to be highly variable across specimens, especially the frill which he interpreted to have had a bigger role in displaying behavior than simply serving as a site of masticatory muscles. He considered unlikely such interpretation based on the relative fragility of some frill bones and the large individual variation, which may have affected the development of those muscles. The length of the frill was found by Dodson to have a rather irregular growth in specimens, as juvenile AMNH 6419 was observed with a frill length smaller than other juveniles. He agreed with Brown and Schlaikjer in that a high, well-developed nasal horn represents a male trait and the opposite indicates females. In addition, Dodson suggested that traits like the nasal horn and frill in male &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have been important visual displays for attracting females and repelling other males, or even predators. Lastly, he noted that both males and females had not significant disparity in body size, and that sexual maturity in &quot;Protoceratops&quot; could be recognised at the moment when males can be distinguished from females.

In 2001, Lambert and team upon the description of &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; also noted variation within individuals. For instance, some specimens (e.g., holotype IMM 95BM1/1) preserve high nasal bones with a pair of horns; relatively short antorbital length; and vertically oriented nostrils. Such traits were regarded as representing male &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;. The other group of skulls is characterized by low nasals that have undeveloped horns; a relatively longer antorbital length; and more oblique nostrils. These individuals were considered as females. The team however, was not able to produce deeper analysis regarding sexual dimorphism in &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; due to the lack of complete specimens. Also in 2001, Tereschhenko analized several specimens of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; to evaluate sexual dimorphism. He found 19 anatomical differences in the vertebral column and pelvic region of regarded male and female &quot;Protoceratops&quot; individuals, which he considered to represent actual sexual characters.

In 2012, Naoto Handa and colleagues described four specimens of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; from the Udyn Sayr locality of the Djadokhta Formation. They indicated that sexual dimorphism in this population was marked by a prominent nasal horn in males—trait also noted by other authors—relative wider nostrils in females, and a wider neck frill in males. Despite maintaining the skull morphology of most &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimens (such as premaxillary teeth), the neck frill in this population was straighter with a near triangular shape. Handa and team in addition found variation across this Udyn Sayr sample and classified them in three groups. First group includes individuals with a well-developed bony ridge on the lateral surface of the squamosal bone, and the posterior border of the squamosal is backwards oriented. Second group had a fairly rounded posterior border of the squamosal, and a long and well-developed bony ridge on the posterior border of the parietal bone. Lastly, the third group was characterized by a curved posterior border of the squamosal and a notorious rugose texture on the top surface of the parietal. Such skull traits were regarded as marked intraspecific variation within &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, and they differ from other populations across the Djadokhta Formation (like Tugriken Shireh), being unique to the Udyn Sayr region. These neck frill morphologies differ from those of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; from the Djadokhta Formation in the adjacent dinosaur locality Tugrikin Shire. The morphological differences among the Udyn Sayr specimens may indicate intraspecific variation of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. A large and well-developed bony ridge on the parietal has been observed on another &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; specimen, MPC-D 100/551, also from Udyn Sayr.

However, Leonardo Maiorino with team in 2015 performed a large geometric morphometric analysis using 29 skulls of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; to evaluate actual sexual dimorphism. Obtained results indicated that other than the nasal horn—which remained as the only skull trait with potential sexual dimorphism—all previously suggested characters to differentiate hyphotetical males from females were more linked to ontogenic changes and intraspecific variation independent of sex, most notably the neck frill. The geometrics showed no consistent morphological differences between specimens that were regarded as males and females by previous authors, but also a slight support for differences in the rostrum across the sample. Maiorino and team nevertheless, cited that the typical regarded &quot;Protoceratops&quot; male, AMNH 6438, pretty much resembles the rostrum morphology of AMNH 6466, a typical regarded female. However, they suggested that authentic differences between sexes could be still present in the postcranial skeleton. Although previously suggested for &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;, the team argued that the sample used for this species was not sufficient, and given that sexual dimorphism was not recovered in &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;, it is unlikely that it occurred in &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot;.

In 2016, Hone and colleagues analyzed 37 skulls of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;, finding that the neck frill of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; (in both length and width) underwent positive allometry during ontongeny, that is, a faster growth/development of this region than the rest of the animal. The jugal bones also showed a trend towards an increase in relative size. These results suggest that they functioned as socio-sexual dominance signals, or, they were mostly used in display. The use of the frill as a displaying structure may be related to other anatomical features of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; such as the premaxillary teeth (at least for &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;) which could have been used in display or intraspecific combat, or the high neural spines of tail. On the other hand, Hone and team argued that if neck frills were instead used for protective purposes, a large frill may have acted as an aposematic (warning) signal to predators. However, such strategies are most effective when the taxon is rare in the overall environment, opposed to &quot;Protoceratops&quot; which appears to be an extremely abundant and medium-sized dinosaur.

Tereschenko in 2018 examined the cervical vertebrae series of six &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; specimens. Most of them had differences in the same exact vertebra, such as the shape and proportions of the vertebral centra and orientation of neural arches. According these differences, four groups were identified, concluding that individual variation was extended to the vertebral column of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;.

In 2020 nevertheless, Andrew C. Knapp and team conducted morphometric analyses of a large sample of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; specimens, primarily confluding that the neck frill of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; has no indicators or evidence for being sexually dimorphic. Obtained results showed instead that several regions of the skull of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; independently varied in their rate of growth, ontogenetic shape and morphology; a high growth of the frill during ontogeny in relation to other body regions; and a large variability of the neck frill independent of size. Knapp and team noted that results of the frill indicate that this structure had a major role in signaling within the species, consistent with selection of potential mates with quality ornamentation and hence reproductive success, or dominance signaling. Such use of the frill may suggest that intraspecific social behavior was highly important for &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. Results also support the general hypothesis that the neck frill of ceratopsians functioned as a socio-sexual signal structure.

===Reproduction===

In 1989, Walter P. Coombs concluded that crocodilians, ratite and megapode birds were suitable modern analogs for dinosaur nesting behavior. He largely considered elongatoolithid eggs to belong to &quot;Protoceratops&quot; because adult skeletons were found in close proximity to nests, interpreting this as an evidence for parental care. Furthermore, Coombs considered the large concentration of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; eggs at small regions as an indicator of marked philopatric nesting (nesting in the same area). The nest of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; would have been excavated with the hindlimbs and was built in a mound-like, crater-shaped center structure with the eggs arranged in semicircular fashion. Richard A. Thulborn in 1992 analyzed the different types of eggs and nests—the majority of them, in fact, elongatoolithid—referred to &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and their structure. He identified types A and B, both of them sharing the elongated shape. Type A eggs differed from type B eggs in having a pinched end. Based on comparisons with other ornithischian dinosaurs such as &quot;Maiasaura&quot; and &quot;Orodromeus&quot;—known from more complete nests—Thulborn concluded that most depictions of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; nests were based on incompletely preserved clutches and mostly on type A eggs, which were more likely to have been laid by an ornithopod. He concluded that nests were built in a shallow mound with the eggs laid radially, contrary to popular restorations of crater-like &quot;Protoceratops&quot; nests.

In 2011, the first authentic nest of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; (MPC-D 100/530) from the Tugriken Shireh locality was described by David E. Fastovsky and team. As some individuals are closely appressed along the well-defined margin of the nest, it may have had a circular or semi-circular shape—as previously hypothetized—with a diameter of . Most of the individuals within the nest had nearly the same age, size and growth, suggesting that they belonged to a single nest, rather than an aggregate of individuals. Fastovsky and team also suggested that even though the individuals were young, they were not perinates based on the absence of eggshell fragments and their large size compared to even more smaller juveniles from this locality. The fact that the individuals likely spend some time in the nest after hatching for growth suggests that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; parents might have cared for their young at nests during at least the early stages of life. As &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was a relatively basal (primitive) ceratopsian, the finding may imply that other ceratopsians provided care for their young as well.

In 2017, Gregory M. Erickson and colleagues determined the incubation periods of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; and &quot;Hypacrosaurus&quot; by using lines of arrested growth (LAGS; lines of growth) of the teeth in embryonic specimens (&quot;Protoceratops&quot; egg clutch MPC-D 100/1021). The results suggests a mean embryonic tooth replacement period of 30.68 days and relatively plesiomorphically (ancestral-shared) long incubation times for &quot;P. andrewsi&quot;, with a minimum incubation time of 83.16 days. Norell and team in 2020 analyzed again this clutch and concluded that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; laid soft-shelled eggs. Most embryos within this clutch have a flexed position and the outlines of eggs are also present, suggesting that they were buried &quot;in ovo&quot; (in the egg). The outlines of eggs and embryos indicates ellipsoid-shaped eggs in life with dimensions about long and wide. Several of the embryos were associated with a black to white halo (circumference). Norell and team performed histological examinations to its chemical composition, finding traces of proteinaceous eggshells, and when compared to other sauropsids the team concluded that they were not biomineralized in life and thus soft-shelled. Given that soft-shelled eggs are more vulnerable to deshydratation and crushing, &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have buried its eggs in moisturized sand or soil. The growing embryos therefore relied on external heat and parental care.

===Paleopathology===
In 2018, Tereshchenko examined and described several articulated cervical vertebrae of &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; and reported the presence of two abnormally fused vertebrae (specimen PIN 3143/9). The fusion of the vertebrae was likely a product of disease or external damage.

===Predator–prey interactions===

Barsbold in 1974 shortly described the Fighting Dinosaurs specimen and discussed possible scenarios. The &quot;Velociraptor&quot; has its right leg pinned under the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; body with its left sickle claw oriented into the throat region. The &quot;Protoceratops&quot; bit the right hand of the predator, implying that it was unable to escape. Barsbold suggested that both animals drowned as they fell into a swamp-like body of water or, the relatively quicksand-like bottom of a lake could have kept them together during the last moments of their fight.

Osmólska in 1993 proposed another two hypotheses to explain their preservation. During the death struggle, a large dune may have collapsed simultaneously burying both &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. Another proposal is that the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was scavenging an already dead &quot;Protoceratops&quot; when it got buried and eventually killed by indeterminate circumstances.

In 1995, David M. Unwin and colleagues cast doubt on previous explanations especially a scavenging hypothesis as there were numerous indications of a concurrent death event. For instance, the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; has a semi-erect stance and its skull is nearly horizontal, which could have not been possible if the animal was already dead. The &quot;Velociraptor&quot; has its right hand trapped within the jaws of the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and the left one grasping the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; skull. Moreover, it lies on the floor with its feet directed to the prey&#x27;s belly and throat areas, indicating that this &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was not scavenging. Unwin and colleagues examined the sediments surrounding the specimen and suggested that the two were buried alive by a powerful sandstorm. They interpreted the interaction as the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; being grasped and dispatched with kicks delivered by the low-lying &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. They also considered possible that populations of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; were aware of crouching behaviors in &quot;Protoceratops&quot; during high-energy sandstorms and used it for successful hunts.

Kenneth Carpenter in 1998 considered the Fighting Dinosaurs specimen to be conclusive evidence for theropods as active predators and not scavengers. He suggested another scenario where the multiple wounds delivered by the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; on the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; throat had the latter animal bleeding to death. As a last effort, the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; bit the right hand of the predator and trapped it beneath its own weight, causing the eventual death and desiccation of the &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. The missing limbs of the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; were afterwards taken by scavengers. Lastly, both animals were buried by sand. Given that the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; is relatively complete, Carpenter suggested that it may have been completely or partially buried by sand.

In 2010, David Hone with team reported a new interaction between &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; based on tooth marks. Several fossils were collected at the Gate locality of the Bayan Mandahu Formation in 2008, including teeth and body remains of protoceratopsid and velociraptorine dinosaurs. The team referred these elements to &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot; mainly based on their abundance across the unit, although they admitted that reported remains could represent different, yet related taxa (in this case, &quot;Linheraptor&quot; instead of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;). At least eight body fossils of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; present active teeth marks, which were interpreted as feeding traces. Much in contrast to the Fighting Dinosaurs specimen, the tooth marks are inferred to have been produced by the dromaeosaurid during late-stage carcass consumption either during scavenging or following a group kill. The team stated that feeding by &quot;Velociraptor&quot; upon &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was probably a relatively common occurrence in these environments, and that this ceratopsian actively formed part of the diet of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

In 2016, Barsbold re-examined the Fighting Dinosaurs specimen and found several anomalies within the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; individual: both coracoids have small bone fragments indicatives of a breaking of the pectoral girdle; the right forelimb and scapulocoracoid are torn off to the left and backward relative to its torso. He concluded that the prominent displacement of pectoral elements and right forelimb was caused by an external force that tried to tear them out. Since this event likely occurred after the death of both animals or during a point where movement was not possible, and the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; is missing other body elements, Barsbold suggested that scavengers were the most likely authors. Because &quot;Protoceratops&quot; is considered to have been a herding animal, another hypothesis is that members of a herd tried to pull out the already buried &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, causing the joint dislocation of limbs. However, Barsbold pointed out that there are no related traces within the overall specimen to support this latter interpretation. Lastly, he restored the course of the fight with the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; power-slamming the &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, which used its feet claws to damage the throat and belly regions and its hand claws to grasp the herbivore&#x27;s head. Before their burial, the deathmatch ended up on the ground with the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; lying on its back right under the &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. After burial, either &quot;Protoceratops&quot; herd or scavengers tore off the buried &quot;Protoceratops&quot; to the left and backward, making both predator and prey to be slightly separated.

===Daily activity===

In 2010, Nick Longrich examined the relatively large orbital ratio and sclerotic ring of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, which he suggested as evidence for a nocturnal lifestyle. Based on the size of its sclerotic ring, &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had an unusually large eyeball among protoceratopsids. In birds, a medium-sized sclerotic ring indicates that the animal is a predator, a large sclerotic ring indicates that it is nocturnal, and the largest ring size indicates it is an active nocturnal predator. Eye size is an important adaptation in predators and nocturnal animals because a larger eye ratio poses a higher sensitivity and resolution. Because of the energy necessary to maintain a larger eyeball and the weakness of the skull that corresponds with a larger orbit, Longrich argues that this structure may have been an adaptation for a nocturnal lifestyle. The jaw morphology of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;—more suitable for processing plant material—and its extreme abundance indicate it was not a predator, so if it was a diurnal animal, then it would have been expected to have a much smaller sclerotic ring size.

However, in 2011, Lars Schmitz and Ryosuke Motani measured the dimensions of the sclerotic ring and eye socket in fossil specimens of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, as well as some living species. They noted that whereas photopic (diurnal) animals have smaller sclerotic rings, scotopic (nocturnal) animals tend to have more enlarged rings. Mesopic (cathemeral) animals—which are irregularly active throughout the day and night—are between these two ranges. Schmitz and Motani separated ecological and phylogenetic factors and by examining 164 living species and noticed that eye measurements are quite accurate when inferring diurnality, cathemerality, or nocturnality in extinct tetrapods. The results indicated that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was a cathemeral herbivore and &quot;Velociraptor&quot; primarily nocturnal, suggesting that the Fighting Dinosaurs deathmatch may have occurred at twilight or under low-light conditions. Lastly, Schmitz and Motani concluded that ecological niche was a potential main driver in the development of daily activity. However, a subsequent study in 2021 found that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; had a greater capability of nocturnal vision than did &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

==Paleoenvironment==
===Bayan Mandahu Formation===

Based on general similarities between the vertebrate fauna and sediments of Bayan Mandahu and the Djadokhta Formation, the Bayan Mandahu Formation is considered to be Late Cretaceous in age, roughly Campanian. The dominant lithology is reddish-brown, poorly cemented, fine grained sandstone with some conglomerate, and caliche. Other facies include alluvial (stream-deposited) and eolian (wind-deposited) sediments. It is likely that sediments at Bayan Mandahu were deposited by short-lived rivers and lakes on an alluvial plain (flat land consisting of sediments deposited by highland rivers) with a combination of dune field paleoenvironments, under a semi-arid climate. The formation is known for its vertebrate fossils in life-like poses, most of which are preserved in unstructured sandstone, indicating a catastrophic rapid burial.

The paleofauna of Bayan Mandahu is very similar in composition to the nearby Djadokhta Formation, with both formations sharing several of the same genera, but differing in the exact species. In this formation, &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; is the representative species, and it shared its paleoenvironment with numerous dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids &quot;Linheraptor&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor osmolskae&quot;; oviraptorids &quot;Machairasaurus&quot; and &quot;Wulatelong&quot;; and troodontids &quot;Linhevenator&quot;, &quot;Papiliovenator&quot;, and &quot;Philovenator&quot;. Other dinosaur members include the alvarezsaurid &quot;Linhenykus&quot;; ankylosaurid &quot;Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus&quot;; and closely related protoceratopsid &quot;Bagaceratops&quot;. Additional fauna from this unit comprises nanhsiungchelyids turtles, and a variety of squamates and mammals.

===Djadokhta Formation===

&quot;Protoceratops&quot; is known from most localities of the Djadokhta Formation in Mongolia, which dates back to the Late Cretaceous about 71 million to 75 million years ago, being deposited during a rapid sequence of polarity changes in the late part of the Campanian stage. Dominant sediments at Djadokhta include dominant reddish-orange and pale orange to light gray, medium to fine-grained sands and sandstones, caliche, and sparse fluvial (river-deposited) processes. Based on these components, the paleoenvironments of the Djadokhta Formation are interpreted as having a hot, semiarid climate with large dune fields/sand dunes and several short-lived water bodies, similar to the modern Gobi Desert. It is estimated that at the end of the Campanian age and into the Maastrichtian the climate would shift to the more mesic (humid/wet) conditions seen in the Nemegt Formation.

The Djadokhta Formation is separated into a lower Bayn Dzak Member and upper Turgrugyin Member. &quot;Protoceratops&quot; is largely known from both members, having &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; as a dominant and representative species in the overall formation. The Bayn Dzak member (mostly the Bayn Dzak locality) has yielded the dromaeosaurids &quot;Halszkaraptor&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot;; oviraptorid &quot;Oviraptor&quot;; ankylosaurid &quot;Pinacosaurus grangeri&quot;; and troodontid &quot;Saurornithoides&quot;. Ukhaa Tolgod, a highly fossiliferous locality is also included in the Bayn Dzak member. and its dinosaur paleofauna is composed of alvarezsaurids &quot;Kol&quot; and &quot;Shuvuuia&quot;; ankylosaurid &quot;Minotaurasaurus&quot;; birds &quot;Apsaravis&quot; and &quot;Gobipteryx&quot;; dromaeosaurid &quot;Tsaagan&quot;; oviraptorids &quot;Citipati&quot; and &quot;Khaan&quot;; troodontids &quot;Almas&quot; and &quot;Byronosaurus&quot;; and a new, unnamed protoceratopsid closely related to &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. In the Turgrugyin Member (mainly Tugriken Shireh locality), &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; shared its paleoenvironment with the bird &quot;Elsornis&quot;; dromaeosaurids &quot;Mahakala&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot;; and ornithomimid &quot;Aepyornithomimus&quot;. &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; is also abundant at Udyn Sayr, where &quot;Avimimus&quot; and &quot;Udanoceratops&quot; have been recovered.

The relatively low dinosaur paleodiversity, small body size of most dinosaurs, and arid settings of the Djadokhta Formation compared to those of the Nemegt Formation, suggest that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and contemporaneous biota lived in a stressed paleoenvironment (physical factors that generate adverse impacts on the ecosystem). In addition, the high occurrence of protoceratopsid fossils in arid-deposited formations indicates that these ceratopsians preferred warm environments. Although &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; was the predominant protoceratopsid on this formation, tentative remains of &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; have been reported from the Udyn Sayr and Bor Tolgoi localities, suggesting that both species co-existed. Whereas &quot;P. andrewsi&quot; is found in aeolian sediments (Bayn Dzak or Tugriken Shireh), &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; is found in the aeolian-fluvial sediments. As the latter type of sediments is also found in the Bayan Mandahu Formation, it is likely that &quot;P. hellenikorhinus&quot; preferred environments combining humid and arid conditions.

===Taphonomy===

In 1993 Jerzykiewiczz suggested that many articulated &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimens died in the process of trying to free themselves from massive sand bodies that trapped them during sandstorms events and were not transported by environmental factors. He cited the distinctive posture of some &quot;Protoceratops&quot; involving the body and head arched upwards with forelimbs tucked in at their sides—a condition known as &quot;standing&quot; in particular cases—the absence of sedimentary structures in sediments preserving the individuals, and the Fighting Dinosaurs taphonomic history itself as evidence for this catastrophic preservation. Given that this posture is exhibited by populations from both Bayan Mandahu and Djadokhta formations, Jerzykiewiczz indicated that this behavior was not unique to any locality. He also considered it unlikely that these &quot;Protoceratops&quot; individuals died after burying themselves in the sand given that these specimens are only found in structureless sandstones; an arched posture would pose hard breathing conditions; and burrowers are known to excavate headfirst and sub horizontally.

Fastovsky in 1997 examined the geology at Tugriken Shireh providing insights into the taphonomy of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. He agreed in that the preservation of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimens indicate that they underwent a catastrophic event such as desert storms, and carcasses were not relocated by scavengers or environmental factors. Several isolated burrows found in sediments at this locality have also been reported penetrating in the bone surface of some buried &quot;Protoceratops&quot; individuals. Fastovsky pointed out these two factors combined indicate that this site was host to high biotic activity, mainly composed of arthropod scavengers who were also involved in the recycling of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; carcasses. The flexed position of most buried &quot;Protoceratops&quot; is indicative of desiccation and shrinking of ligaments/tendons in the legs, necks, and tails after death.

In 1998 during a conference abstract at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, James I. Kirkland and team reported multiple arthropod pupae casts and borings (tunnels) on a largely articulated &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimen from Tugriken Shireh, found in 1997. A notorious amount of pupae were found in clusters and singly along the bone surfaces, mostly in the joint areas, where the trace makers would have feed on dried ligaments, tendons and cartilage. The examined pupae from the specimen are more cylindrical structures with rounded ends. The pupae found in this &quot;Protoceratops&quot; individual were reported as measuring as much a long and wide and compare best with pupae attributed to solitary wasps. Additionally, the reported borings have a structure that differs from traces made by dermestid beetles. The team indicated that both pupae and boring traces reflect a marked ecological relationship between dinosaur carcasses and a relatively large necrophagous insect taxon.

Later in 2010, Kirkland and Kenneth Bader redescribed and discussed the numerous feeding traces from this &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimen, which they nicknamed Fox Site &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. They found at least three types of feeding traces on this individual; nearly circular borings—which they found instead to correlate best with feeding traces made by dermestid beetles—of in diameter; semicircular shaped notches at the edge of bones; and destruction of articular surfaces, mostly at the joints of the limbs. The co-workers also noted that the Fox Site &quot;Protoceratops&quot; preserves associated traces in the encasing sediment, indicative of necrophagous activity after the animal was buried. Kirkland and Bader concluded that adults of a large beetle taxon would detect decaying carcasses buried below the sand and dig down to feed and lay their eggs. After emerging from the eggs, larvae would have fed on the carcass prior to pupating. The last larvae to emerge would have feed on the dried tendons and cartilage in the joint areas—thereby explaining the notorious poor preservation of these areas in the specimen—and subsequently chewing on the bone itself, prior to pupating. After reaching full maturity, adult beetles would have then dig back to the surface, most likely leaving borings through bones, and finally beginning to search for new carcasses and thus continuing the recycling of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; carcasses.

In 2010 the paleontologists Yukihide Matsumoto and Mototaka Saneyoshi reported multiple borings and bite traces on joint areas of articulated &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimens from the Tugriken Shireh locality of the Djadokhta Formation and Hermiin Tsav locality of the Barun Goyot Formation, respectively. They interpreted the damaged areas in the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimen as product of active feeding by burrowing arthropods, most likely insects. These specimens were formally described and discussed in 2011 by Saneyoshi and team, including fossils from &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and an ankylosaurid. Reported traces were identified as pits, notches, borings, and channels across the skeletons, most notably at limb joint areas. The team indicated that it is very likely that these were made by scavenging insects, however, relatively large borings (about wide) in the ribs and scapulae of one &quot;Protoceratops&quot; specimen (MPC-D100/534) indicates that insects were not the only scavengers involved in the bone damage, but also mammals. Given the dry/harsh paleoenvironmental conditions of units like the Djadokhta Formation, medium to large-sized dinosaur carcasses may have been an important source of nutrition for small animals. Saneyoshi and team emphasized that the high frequency of feeding traces at the limb joints of numerous specimens and reports of previous studies, indicates that small animals may have targeted the collagen found in the joint cartilage of dried dinosaur carcasses as a source of nitrogen, which was low in the desert-dry conditions of these dinosaur fossils.

In 2011 Fastovsky with colleagues concluded that the juveniles within the nest MPC-D 100/530 were rapidly overwhelmed by a strong sand-bearing event and entombed alive. The sediments of the nest suggest a deposition through a dune-shift or strong sandstorms, and the orientation of the individuals indicates that sediments were brought from a prevailing west-southwest wind. Most individuals are preserved with their forelimbs splayed and hindlimbs are extended, an arrangement that suggests that young &quot;Protoceratops&quot; tried to push against the powerful airstream in the initially loose sand. Prior to or during burial, some may have tried to climb on top of others. Because it is generally accepted that most fossil specimens at Tugriken Shireh were preserved by rapidly migrating dunes and sandstorms, Fastovsky with colleagues suggested that the lee side borders of the nest would have been the area where air was sand-free and consequently, all young &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have struggled to reach this area, resulting in their final burial and eventual death.

Hone and colleagues in 2014 indicated that two assemblages of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; at Tugriken Shireh (MPC-D 100/526 and 100/534) suggest that individuals died simultaneously, rather than accumulating over time. For instance, the block of four juveniles preserves the individuals with near-identical postures, spatial positions, and all of them have their heads facing upwards, which indicates that they were alive at the time of burial. During burial, the animals were most likely not completely restricted in their movements at all, given that the individuals of MPC-D 100/526 are in relatively normal life positions and have not been disturbed. At least two individuals within this block are preserved with their arms at a level above the legs, suggestive of attempts of trying to move upwards with the purpose of free themselves. The team also noted the presence of borings on the skulls and skeletons of both assemblages, and these may have been produced by insect larvae after the animals died.

In 2016 Meguru Takeuchi and team reported numerous fossilized feeding traces preserved on skeletons of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; from the Bayn Dzak, Tugriken Shireh, and Udyn Sayr localities, and also from other dinosaurs. Preserved traces were reported as pits, notches, borings, and tunnels, which they attributed to scavengers. The diameter of the feeding traces preserved on a &quot;Protoceratops&quot; skull from Bayn Dzak was bigger than traces reported among other specimens, indicating that the scavengers responsible for these traces were notoriously different from other trace makers preserved on specimens.

===Possible Influence on Griffin Legend===
The folklorist and historian of science Adrienne Mayor of Stanford University has suggested that the exquisitely preserved fossil skeletons of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and other beaked dinosaurs, found by ancient Scythian nomads who mined gold in the Tian Shan and Altai Mountains of Central Asia, may have played a role in the image of the mythical creature known as the griffin. Griffins were described as wolf- or lion-sized quadrupeds with large claws and a raptor-bird-like beak; they laid their eggs in nests on the ground.

Dodson in 1996 pointed out Greek writers began describing the griffin around 675 B.C., at the time the first Greek writings about Scythia nomads appeared, although contact with Scythian nomads would have occurred earlier, in the Bronze Age when Greeks imported tin from Afghanistan, transported on the caravan routes across the Gobi and other deserts. Griffins were described as &quot;guarding&quot; the gold deposits in the arid hills and red sandstone formations of the wilderness below the Tien Shan and Altai mountains. The region of Mongolia and China, where many &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and other dinosaur fossils are found, is rich in placer gold runoff from the neighboring mountains, lending some credence to the theory that these fossils played a role in griffin descriptions of the seventh century BC to Roman times.

Mayor in 2001 and 2011 refined the hypothesis of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; as an influence on the griffin legend by analyzing written details and artistic imagery. She also cited some other Greek histories about mythological creatures may have been influenced by fossil discoveries by ancient people, such as cyclopes and giants.

In 2016 this hypothesis was criticized by the British paleontologist and paleoartist Mark P. Witton, as it ignores pre-Greek &quot;griffin art and accounts.&quot; (No written accounts of griffins are known before ca 675 BC, when the word gryps/griffin is first attested.) Witton goes on to point out that the wings of traditional griffins are positioned above the shoulder blades, not behind the neck as the frills of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, that the bodies of griffins much more closely resemble the bodies of modern big cats than they do those of &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, and that the gold deposits of central Asia occur hundreds of kilometers from the known &quot;Protoceratops&quot; fossil remains, among many other inconsistencies. It is simpler, he argues, to understand the griffin as a mythical combination of well-known extant animal species than as an ancient misunderstanding of fossilized collections of bones. Witton later co-published with Richard Hing a 2024 paper expanding on his points regarding the tenuous link between griffins and &quot;Protoceratops&quot;.

<doc id="1064035" wikidata="Q3776135" url="?curid=1064035" title="Siege of Derry">
<text>The siege of Derry in 1689 was the first major event in the Williamite War in Ireland. The siege was preceded by an attempt against the town by Jacobite forces on 7 December 1688 that was foiled when 13 apprentices shut the gates. This was an act of rebellion against James II.

The second attempt began on 18 April 1689 when James himself appeared before the walls with an Irish army led by Jacobite and French officers. The town was summoned to surrender but refused. The siege began. The besiegers tried to storm the walls, but failed. They then resorted to starving Derry. They raised the siege and left when supply ships broke through to the town. The siege lasted 105 days from 18 April to 1 August 1689. It is commemorated yearly by the Protestant community.

== Introduction ==
The &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; overthrew James II, King of England, Scotland, and Ireland and replaced him with William of Orange, who landed in England on 5 November 1688. James fled to France in December. Louis XIV, King of France, received James well because he needed him and his supporters, the Jacobites, as allies in the Nine Years&#x27; War, which he had just started by investing Philippsburg on 27 September and declaring war on the Dutch Republic on 6/16 November. On 7 May 1689, Williamite England declared war on France, quite belatedly, as French officers and experts had already been fighting William&#x27;s troops at Derry before that time. This siege is part of the Williamite War in Ireland, which in turn is a side-show of the Nine Years&#x27; War.

In Scotland, the privy council asked William to assume responsibility for the government in January 1689, and William and Mary were formally offered the Scottish throne in March. However, many Scottish people, especially among the Highland clans, had sympathies for the Jacobite cause.

Ireland, however, was still ruled by Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnell, whom James had appointed viceroy (i.e. Lord Deputy) in 1687. Tyrconnell was from an Old English (Norman) Catholic family. He had re-admitted Catholics to the Irish Parliament and public office, and had replaced Protestant officers with Catholic ones in the army. Tyrconnell, and Irish Catholics in general, stayed loyal to James and many Irish Protestants hesitated to declare themselves openly for William. Tyrconnell took action against those who did, and by November 1688 only the Protestants of Ulster were still resisting. Two Ulster towns, Enniskillen and Derry, were to become the focal points of the first stage of the Williamite war.

Louis XIV had revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, which resulted in Huguenots fleeing to northern Europe and rekindled fears of persecution in Protestant communities.

== Apprentice boys ==
When the Dutch invasion threatened, James doubted the loyalty of his English troops. He therefore asked Tyrconnell to send him reliable Irish ones. These units sailed to Chester in September and early October 1688. To replace them Tyrconnell ordered four new regiments to be raised, one for each Irish province. He ordered Alexander MacDonnell, Earl of Antrim, a Catholic nobleman of Scottish origin, to raise the Ulster regiment. MacDonnell, already in his seventies, hired 1,200 Scottish mercenaries (called redshanks), making sure they were all Catholics. The unit was supposed to be ready on 20 November, but delays occurred.

At that time Tyrconnell&#x27;s recast of the Irish army had advanced so far that few units still had significant numbers of Protestants. One of those was the regiment of Viscount Mountjoy, a Protestant loyal to James. This unit was in garrison at Derry. Tyrconnell considered Mountjoy&#x27;s regiment unreliable and on 23 November ordered it to march to Dublin. Mountjoy&#x27;s regiment was to be replaced by MacDonnell&#x27;s, which was not ready so that Derry was left without a garrison.

When MacDonnell finally got his troops on the way, he met Colonel George Philips at Newtown Limavady, who immediately sent a messenger to Derry to warn the city. On 7 December, with MacDonnell&#x27;s regiment ready to cross the Foyle River under Derry&#x27;s Ferryquay Gate, 13 apprentices seized the city&#x27;s keys and locked the gates. With this act Derry was in open rebellion against Tyrconnell and his master James II, who was already in exile in France at that time. MacDonnell was not strong enough to take the town by force and retreated to Coleraine.

== Interlude ==
Later generations have sometimes seen the shutting of the gates by the apprentices as the start of the siege. In reality, six peaceful months passed between the apprentices&#x27; action (7 December) and the start of the siege (18 June 1689). In a similar way Robert Lundy&#x27;s blunders, flight, and supposed treachery (see further down) are often telescoped into the days of the apprentices&#x27; action, while in reality, they fell into the lead-up to the siege in June 1689.

On 9 December Philips came into town. As he had been governor of Derry and Fort Culmore under Charles I, the citizens gave him the keys and accepted him as de facto governor. When Tyrconnell heard that MacDonnell had been kept out of Derry, he stopped Mountjoy on his march to Dublin and sent him back. On 21 December Mountjoy reached Derry. He struck a deal with the city, according to which two of his companies, consisting entirely of Protestants, would be allowed into town. The one was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Lundy, the other by Captain William Stewart.

Mountjoy appointed Lundy governor of the town instead of Philips. On 20 February the inhabitants sided with William by proclaiming him king of England. Lundy had the walls and the gates repaired, refitted gun carriages and musket stocks, removed buildings and other obstacles that might provide cover to besiegers from before the walls, purchased powder, cannonballs and matchlocks.

Tyrconnell upscaled his efforts to bring Ulster back under control, and on 8 March he sent Lieutenant-General Richard Hamilton with an army of 2500 from Drogheda into Ulster. On 14 March Hamilton defeated the Protestant Army of the North at the Break of Dromore in County Down.

In the meantime, on 12 March, James had landed at Kinsale (on Ireland&#x27;s south coast) with a French fleet of 30 men-of-war commanded by Jean Gabaret. He was accompanied by d&#x27;Avaux, the French ambassador, many English and Irish exiles, and about a hundred French officers. He brought with him money and equipment, but few troops. French troops were needed on the continent for the Nine Years&#x27; War and were not considered necessary in Ireland as Tyrconnell had already raised a large army and only lacked equipment and the money to pay the men.

At Kinsale, James was received by Donogh MacCarthy, 4th Earl of Clancarty, in his house there. We will meet him again at Derry. From Kinsale James proceeded to Cork where he met Tyrconnell. He left Cork on 20 March and entered Dublin on Palm Sunday 24. He took up quarters in the castle and established his council on which sat d&#x27;Avaux, Tyrconnell, John Drummond, Earl of Melfort, and Conrad de Rosen.

Hearing of James&#x27;s arrival, Derry prepared to defend itself. On 20 or 21 March Captain James Hamilton arrived from England with the frigate and the merchantman &quot;Deliverance&quot;, bringing gunpowder, munition, weapons, and £595 in cash. James Hamilton was a nephew of Richard Hamilton but fought on the other side. These provisions were to be crucial during the siege. He also brought the commission from King William and Queen Mary that confirmed Colonel Lundy as the town&#x27;s Williamite governor. Lundy swore the oath of allegiance to William in the cabin of the &quot;Jersey&quot;. The town committee decided to build a ravelin in front of the Bishops Gate, possibly using some of the money brought by Captain Hamilton.

== Siege ==
Tyrconnell and James decided to bring Derry back under their control. On 2 or 3 April Major-General Jean Camus, Marquis de Pusignan, marched north with five regiments of foot. This brought the number of troops in the north to about 12000. James followed on 8 April, accompanied by d&#x27;Avaux and Melfort.

=== The passes ===
On 13 April cavalry forming part of the Jacobite vanguard was reported approaching Derry. Lundy called a council of war that decided to defend a line along the River Finn, SW of Derry, near Strabane. Passes over the river at Castlefin, Clady, Long Causeway, and Lifford were manned. On 15 April, this line was attacked by the cavalry vanguards of the two Jacobite armies, Hamilton&#x27;s, which had come from Coleraine, and Rosen&#x27;s, which had come from Dublin via Charlemont. Hamilton&#x27;s cavalry attacked on the Jacobites&#x27; left wing at Castlefinn and Clady. At Castlefinn they were repulsed by Colonel Skeffington&#x27;s Regiment, commanded by John Mitchelburne, but at Clady the cavalry under Richard Hamilton and Berwick swam through the river and routed the defenders. This has been called the Battle of Cladyford. The Long Causeway was not attacked. Rosen&#x27;s cavalry attacked on the right wing, at Lifford where Jacques de Fontanges, comte de Maumont crossed the river at the head of his cavalry and broke through the defences.

=== Lundy&#x27;s blunder ===
In the meantime, the English sent reinforcements to Derry. On the very day of the defeat at the Passes, on 15 April, Colonel Cunningham and Colonel Richards arrived on Lough Foyle with the frigate , commanded by Captain Wolfran Cornewall, and nine transport ships carrying two regiments, altogether about 1600 men. Cunningham, who was in charge, had been instructed to take his orders from Lundy, the governor. Lundy, disheartened by his defeat at the Passes, was convinced that the town was lost. On 16 April Lundy held a council of war with Cunningham and Richards from which he excluded most of the local commanders. He proposed the troops should not land and the town should be abandoned pretending that there were insufficient provisions to defend it.

The proposal was accepted by all present. Lundy kept this resolution secret, but the people in town could see that many of the gentry and officers that had been present in the council prepared to leave and went down to the river to board the ships. Cunningham&#x27;s fleet waited for Lundy still on 17 April but then left, apparently without him. The ships stopped over at Greencastle on 18 April and sailed for England on 19 April. Finally, Lundy left the city disguised as an ordinary soldier and took a ship to Scotland.

=== Under the walls ===
Having broken through the passes, Hamilton reached Derry on 18 April and summoned the city to surrender. The defenders asked for a delay of two days before a parley. They also insisted that the Jacobite army should halt at St Johnston and not come nearer. However, when King James joined up with the army, Rosen suggested the King should appeal directly to his subjects in the town: they would surely submit to their King. The effect was the contrary. The men on the wall seeing him approach interpreted this act as a breach of their agreement with Hamilton and when James and his retinue rode up to within 300 yards of Bishops Gate and summoned the city, cannons were fired at them.

According to a later account, he was rebuffed with shouts of &quot;No surrender!&quot; and one of the king&#x27;s aides-de-camp was killed by a shot from the city&#x27;s largest cannon, the &quot;Roaring Meg&quot;. James would ask thrice more, but was refused each time.

That same day Adam Murray reached the town. He and his cavalry unit had been part of the Protestant Army of the North and had fought at the passes. He came from Culmore along the river, broke through the still quite loose ring formed by the besiegers around the town, and reached Shipquay Gate, which Captain Morrison opened for him.

On 19 April the town council appointed Henry Baker governor of Derry. Baker put George Walker in charge of the stores.

On 20 April King James sent Claud Hamilton, 4th Earl of Abercorn, with a last proposal to the walls. Murray talked with him and rejected it. James returned to Dublin with Rosen and left the forces before Derry under Maumont&#x27;s command. However, Richard Hamilton also stayed and was of equal rank. Both had been promoted Lieutenant-General quite recently. Frictions sometimes arose between the Irish and the French officers about who was in command.

On 21 April the besieged, led by Murray, sallied and killed Maumont. This has also been called the Battle of Pennyburn. Command devolved to Richard Hamilton. On 23 April Fort Culmore, which guarded the mouth of River Foyle, surrendered to the Jacobites. During another sally, on 25 April, the Duke of Berwick and Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis, were wounded and Pusignan killed.

On 6 May Brigadier-General Ramsay attacked the Windmill Hill before the Bishops Gate and drove out the sentinels posted there by the besieged, but Baker knew the importance of this position and on the next day, the besieged sallied from the Ferryquay Gate and retook Windmill Hill. Ramsay was killed and other officers were taken prisoners. Among them were William Talbot, a nephew of the viceroy, Viscount Netterville and Gerald FitzGerald, Knight of Glin. Baker built a line of earthworks from the river up to Windmill Hill and back through the Bog to the river downstream of the town.

On 7 May Williamite England formally declared war on France. This officially sanctioned what was already happening around Derry since 18 April. Two French generals, Maumont and Pusignan, had already been killed in the siege. France never declared war on England as they saw James as the rightful king and the Williamites as mere rebels.

On 11 May a French fleet landed more equipment and troops at Bantry Bay in southwestern Ireland and fought the battle of Bantry Bay against an English fleet. The battle was inconclusive, but the French seemed to have had the advantage.

On 30 May the besiegers received heavy guns and mortars. Before that date they only had field artillery. Matthew Plunkett, 7th Baron Louth, and de Pointis were in charge of the mortars, which were placed on the right bank of the river where no sally could reach them. The mortars fired almost 600 explosive shells into the town.

About this time disease and hunger took hold within the city. It became evident that the town needed to be relieved. William gave that task to Major-General Percy Kirke, who decided to first explore the mouth of River Foyle to find out whether ships could get through to Derry. He sent the engineer Jacob Richards, son of Solomon Richards, mentioned earlier, with the small (sixth-rate) frigate HMS &quot;Greyhound&quot; and two ketches. They sailed from Hoylake on 13 May and explored the mouth of River Foyle on 8 June. However, &quot;Greyhound&quot; ran aground near Fort Culmore and was damaged by cannon shot before she got afloat, escaped and after some makeshift repairs limped back to Greenock in Scotland to refit. Observations and information obtained from the inhabitants confirmed that the besiegers had placed a boom across the river. Indeed, on 3 June, the besiegers, led by de Pointis, had placed a boom across the River Foyle about halfway between Derry and Culmore.

On 17 May Major-General Percy Kirke sailed from Liverpool with three men-of-war (HMS &quot;Swallow&quot;, , and ) and 24 transport ships. The fleet carried four regiments (about 3000 men: Kirke&#x27;s own, Sir John Hanmer&#x27;s, William Stewart&#x27;s and St George&#x27;s). The last two were the regiments that should have landed with Cunningham. The convoy arrived in Lough Foyle early in June. The besieged saw it from the cathedral tower on the 13th.

Kirke thought that he had too few troops to challenge the besiegers in battle and the incident with the &quot;Greyhound&quot; seemed to show that it was too risky to approach the town by the river.

On 4 June Richard Hamilton ordered to storm the town. The Jacobites attacked the line of earthworks and passed over them in some places but were finally beaten back.

In order to accelerate the siege, James sent Rosen to Derry, who arrived on the scene at some time between 17 and 24 June. Rosen brought with him the regiment FitzGerald from Trim. On 21 June Berwick was sent south with a detachment to keep the Enniskilleners away. Rosen intensified the bombardment and had a mine dug under a bastion.

On 28 June Clancarty came up from Munster to Derry with his regiment and led a daring night attack against the Butcher&#x27;s Gate immediately on the evening of his arrival. The besieged were surprised and the attackers succeeded to come up against the gate and touch it but were eventually thrown back.

At the beginning of June, Governor Baker fell ill and on 21 June a council was held to choose a successor. Baker was consulted and chose John Mitchelburne. On 30 June Baker died and Mitchelburne became governor of Derry.

On 2 July Rosen herded Protestants from the surroundings to under the wall. The besieged responded by threatening to kill prisoners. Hamilton reported this event to James, who disagreed with Rosen&#x27;s measure and called him a &quot;barbarious Muscovite&quot;.

=== Relief ===
Frederick de Schomberg, having been appointed commander-in-chief by William, ordered Kirke to attack the boom. Thereupon, on 28 July, Kirke sent four ships to the mouth of the River Foyle to try to bring food into Derry. These were HMS &quot;Dartmouth&quot; and three merchant ships: &quot;Mountjoy&quot; from Derry, &quot;Phoenix&quot; from Coleraine, and &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. &quot;Dartmouth&quot;, under Captain John Leake, engaged the shore batteries, while &quot;Mountjoy&quot;, commanded by her Master Michael Browning, rammed and breached the boom, whereupon &quot;Mountjoy&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; sailed up to Derry, unloading many tons of food. Seeing that he could no longer starve out Derry and not having enough troops to storm the town, Rosen decided to raise the siege. On 1 August the besieged discovered that the enemy was gone. On 3 August Kirke reported the raising of the siege to London. On 31 July another Jacobite army had been defeated at Newtownbutler by the Enniskilleners.

The city had endured 105 days of siege, from 18 April to 1 August. Some 4,000 of its garrison of 8,000 are said to have died during this siege.

== Commemorations ==
The Siege of Derry, like the Battle of the Boyne, is part of Northern Irish Protestant folklore. The siege is commemorated by two parades: the Shutting-of-the-Gates Parade and the Relief-of-Derry Parade.

The shutting of the gates by 13 apprentices, which happened on 7 December 1688, is commemorated each year on the first Saturday of December, dubbed &quot;Lundy&#x27;s Day&quot;. The commemoration is organised by the Apprentice Boys of Derry, a Protestant association. The day usually starts with the firing of one and then three cannon shots, meaning 13, from the walls at midnight on Friday. Then follows the ceremony of the touching of the four original gates: Bishops Gate, Butchers Gate, Shipquay Gate, and Ferryquay Gate. On Saturday, first the members of the Apprentice Boys clubs domiciled outside the walls march to the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall. Then the assembled members march through the city from the Hall to St Columb&#x27;s Cathedral where a thanks-giving service is held. After the service, a wreath is laid at the Siege Heroes Mound in the cathedral grounds. Finally, Lundy is burned in effigy as a traitor.

The end of the siege, which is taken to have happened on 1 August 1689, old style, when the besieged discovered that the besiegers had left, is celebrated by the Relief of Derry parade, usually held on the second Saturday of August. This day is chosen because it usually is near 11 August, which is the New Style equivalent of 1 August. This parade is one of the events of the week-long Maiden City Festival. On 1 August 1714, Mitchelburne hoisted a crimson flag on the steeple of St Columb&#x27;s Cathedral to mark the anniversary of the relief of the city, a practice that continued for many years. In 1969 a confrontation between Protestants and Catholics during the Relief of Derry parade started the Battle of the Bogside, but recent parades have been largely peaceful.

Walker&#x27;s Pillar was a monument to Reverend George Walker. It was built from 1826 to 1828 on the Royal Bastion. The monument consisted of a column crowned by a statue of the famous man. On the night of 27 August 1973, it was blown up by the Provisional IRA. The plinth remains.

The Browning Memorial Plaque is affixed to the city wall on Guildhall Square. It commemorates Michael (or Micaiah) Browning, the Master of the &quot;Mountjoy&quot;. The top shows his ship, the &quot;Mountjoy&quot;. The inscription below cites the passage describing his death in Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot;, which calls his: &quot;the most enviable of all deaths&quot;.

The popular song &quot;Derry&#x27;s Walls&quot; commemorates the siege. The author is unknown. The chorus reads:
:We&#x27;ll fight and don&#x27;t surrender
:But come when duty calls,
:With heart and hand and sword and shield
:We&#x27;ll guard old Derry&#x27;s Walls.

<text>Jenkinstown Park is a park in County Kilkenny, Ireland. It is situated off the N78 road about 10 km north of the city of Kilkenny and 11 km south of Castlecomer. The Dunmore Caves are nearby.

== History ==
The park was formerly part of the old Bryan-Bellew Estate. A small garden to commemorate Thomas Moore&#x27;s association with the house has been laid down on the site of the old house. 

== Facilities ==
Facilities include a picnic site, forest walks, small commemorative garden, deer park and a craft centre. There are walks of between one and three kilometres through a plantation of mixed broadleaf and conifers. The park is managed by Coillte.
==Flora and fauna==
Tree species within the park include beech, ash, oak, and Norway spruce. Some original park trees from the 1870s survive and include a number of rare species such as the Chinese necklace poplar, &quot;Populus lasiocarpa&quot;. Bluebells typically flower, in the beech and birch woods in the park, from mid April to late May.

The park is home to foxes, badgers, stoats, red and grey squirrels, and enclosed deer, as well as bats in the old church. A number of species of birds – including pheasant, ravens, and the long-eared owl – inhabit the woods.

<text>The Integrated Project Support Environment (IPSE) is a set of management and technical tools to support software development, usually integrated in a coherent framework, equivalent to a Software Engineering Environment.

Influential IPSE research was done in the IPSE2.5 project, part of the Alvey programme. The name IPSE2.5 is due directly to the identification in the Alvey programme of three generations of IPSEs. The IPSE2.5 project lay somewhere between the second generation (characterised by the use of databases to support the core) and the third generation (characterised by the use of expert systems techniques). IPSE2.5 is credited with defining early versions of the Role and Interaction concepts later used in human interaction management.

<text>During the Cold War, a number of pilots from various nations (Eastern Bloc, Western Bloc, and non-aligned) defected with their aircraft to other countries.

==Afghanistan==
* On November 24, 1960, Royal Afghan Air Force pilot Abdus Samad Fazli defected by flying his Piper Cub across the border to Pakistan.
* On February 26, 1981, Afghan Air Force pilot Captain Jamal ud Din defected with his crew to Pakistan on board a Mil Mi-8T helicopter numbered 285, during post-maintenance flight test from Kandahar Air Base.
* On November 20, 1983, Captain Mohammed Nabi Korinzay defected to Pakistan with his Sukhoi Su-7BM fighter-bomber. The aircraft broke up during a crash landing on the runway at Dalbandin.
* On September 22, 1984, Colonel Haji Fakir, flying an An-26 defected from Afghanistan to Miranshah Air Base, Pakistan.
* On June 28, 1985, the crews of two Mi-24 Hind-Ds defected from Afghanistan to Pakistan. The helicopters were later transferred to the United States for evaluation, they were later returned and one of them is now at display in Khalid Aviation Base Quetta (Pakistan).
* On December 8, 1988, Captain Asadullah flying a MiG-21 defected from Afghanistan to Miranshah Air Base, Pakistan.
* On July 3, 1989, Captain Mohammed Hamid flying a Mi-25 defected from Afghanistan to Kica Air Base, Pakistan.
* On July 6, 1989, Afghan Air Force Captain Jan Pahrand defected to Pakistan with his Sukhoi Su-22M-4K fighter-bomber.

==Algeria==
*An Algerian helicopter pilot, captain Alili Messaoud, flew his Mi-8 from Blida Air Force Base, southwest of Algeria, first to Formentera island and then to Ibiza, Spain, on June 17, 1998, getting away from the Algerian civil war (1992-2002). The helicopter was subsequently returned to Algeria while the pilot asked for political asylum that was not granted because of Algerian pressures, however he was granted a resident visa each year continuing to the present.

==China==

A number of defections occurred from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with most of its pilots defecting to the Republic of China (Taiwan). These include:

*On January 12, 1960, the first PLA defection occurred. Yang Decai, a PLANAF pilot from the 4th Fighter Division flew a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 with serial number 6501 from Luqiao air base to Yilan County, Taiwan. However, Yang was killed when his aircraft crashed on landing.
*On September 15, 1961, PLAAF pilots Shao Xiyan and Gao Youzong flew an Antonov An-2 from Ji&#x27;ao county, Shandong to Jeju-do and reached Taiwan on October 7, 1961. Both pilots were personally interviewed by Chiang Kai-shek and rewarded 500 taels (approximately 25 kg) of gold. Both pilots served in the Republic of China Air Force and retired with ranks of colonel, and Shao eventually emigrated to the United States.
*On March 3, 1962, Liu Chengsi, a PLANAF pilot of the 8th squadron of the 3rd wing of the 16th regiment flew a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 from Luqiao air base in Zhejiang to Taoyuan County, Taiwan (now Taoyuan City). Liu was rewarded 1,000 taels (approximately 50 kg) of gold, and the position of deputy director of a Republic of China Air Force radio station. He was honorably discharged with a rank of colonel.

*On November 11, 1965, Li Xianbin, a PLAAF captain of Ilyushin Il-28 of the 8th division flew his bomber numbered 0195 from Jianqiao air base in Hangzhou to Taoyuan County, Taiwan (now Taoyuan City); this was the first fully operational Il-28 in western hands. The radio operator / tail gunner Lian Baosheng was found dead at the scene and the navigator Li Caiwang was captured alive after a suicide attempt. Both survivors were honored and rewarded positions in the Republic of China Air Force. Li Xianbin was rewarded 2,000 taels (approximately 100 kg) of gold, while Li Caiwang was rewarded 1,000 taels (approximately 50 kg) of gold. Since Lian Baosheng was dead, his reward of 1,000 taels (approximately 50 kg) of gold was divided evenly among Li Xianbin and Li Caiwang.
**Li Xianbin made headlines in Taiwan years later when he demanded all of the rewards because of what he claimed was his unfair treatment by Taiwan. Li Xianbin claimed that he was the sole defector, and the other two were actually captured due to his defection, a fact that was later agreed by both Taiwan and the navigator Li Caiwang himself. Li Xianbin claimed that for the purpose of political propaganda, all the crew were honored as defectors, which was far from the truth, but he was not successful in getting all of the gold reward. After he was honorably discharged as colonel from the Republic of China Air Force, Li Xianbin obtained Canadian residency. He made headlines again in 1992 when he returned to China via Canada after he learned that his mother was about to die. After his return to Qingdao in October 1992, he was eventually arrested by the local Public Security Bureau when he was on his way to the airport for his return trip to Canada. Li Xianbin was first sentenced to 15 years but this was later reduced to 10, and the sentence was further reduced drastically because it was discovered that he had stomach cancer that was in its terminal stage. He was released early and died shortly after his release. Many elements of the Chinese democracy movement first accused the Chinese government of inhumanity for not allowing Li Xianbin to go back to China to visit his dying mother, and then accused the Chinese government of trying to repatriate him to either Taiwan or Canada because the regime did not want to foot the bill for his treatment, since he did not have his assets transferred to China. 
**Li Caiwang, the navigator of the Il-28, was seriously wounded by Li Xianbin during the latter&#x27;s defection and was forced to accept his fate after his suicide attempt failed. During his stay in the hospital for the gunshot he received in the shoulder, the nurse who took care of him fell in love with him and told him that she was also responsible to perform surveillance on him, under the order of the Republic of China government. The two eventually married and moved into the nurse&#x27;s home, but were still under constant surveillance: a major general of the Republic of China military had a son who was going to a school near the couple&#x27;s home, so he rented a room at their residence for years to keep Li Caiwang under surveillance. Although the major general and his son finally moved out, Li Caiwang had no intention of staying in Taiwan, and since the wife&#x27;s sister was married to an American, Li Caiwang and his wife immigrated to the United States in 1972 after his honorable discharge from the Republic of China Air Force as a colonel. The couple became naturalized citizens of the United States in 1979. In 1982, Chinese diplomats contacted Li Caiwang in the United States and got his side of the story, and after a prolonged investigation, the Chinese government rehabilitated him in 1984. After several visits to China in the 1990s, Li Caiwang eventually resettled in China in 1998.
*On July 7, 1977, Fan Yuanye, a PLAAF pilot flew his Shenyang J-6 numbered 3171 from Jinjiang to an air base in Tainan, and was rewarded a rank of lieutenant colonel in the Republic of China Air Force. After his honorable discharge from the Republic of China Air Force, Fan joined an investment firm with his money and obtained American green card, but he stayed primarily in Taiwan to handle his investments.
*On April 15, 1979, Yan Wenchang, a distinguished PLAAF pilot who earned numerous awards for his excellent performance in support of the Sino-Vietnamese War, was extremely bitter after learning that the promotion for the deputy squadron commissar was given to somebody else instead of him. Yan felt he was the better candidate and should get the promotion and he was under appreciated, and as a result, he decided to defect to Vietnam after learning that the opportunity would be gone because his unit would soon be redeployed to Hunan, and the only thing he left was a note to his wife that read:&quot;I&#x27;ll be gone, good-bye forever!&quot;&#x27;. However, Vietnam did not react at all to his attempts for contacts after his Shenyang J-6 entered Vietnam from Guangxi, and as result, Yan was killed after directly crashing into a 1,000 metre high mountains cliff approximately 80 km south of Haiphong. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Vietnam the next day that the incident was a navigational error and asked for the return of the remains of the pilot and the jet, but Vietnam refused, and instead, asked Soviet investigators to inspect the wreckage. KGB aviation experts discovered that the avionics of Yan&#x27;s J-6 was extremely rudimentary even by Soviet standard, and was indeed lacking any effective navigational avionics. Furthermore, the communication on the J-6 was not encrypted, and it could be intercepted by advanced civilian radios on the market. Since Yan was a regular pilot that patrolled the airspace within the 10 km of the Sino-Vietnamese border (sometimes as frequent as 4 times a day), his defection was not detected until his crash.
*On August 7, 1983, Sun Tianqin, a former PLANAF pilot who had just transferred to PLAAF several months ago to become a test pilot, flew a J-7II numbered 045 from Dalian to Seoul Air Base in South Korea. Sun was rewarded a rank of colonel in the Republic of China Air Force and 7,000 taels (approximately 350 kg) of gold, the highest ever recorded. In January 1985, Sun married Li Tianhui, a Chinese musician who also defected to Taiwan, and the pair eventually immigrated to Canada after Sun&#x27;s honorable discharge from the Republic of China Air Force.
*On November 14, 1983, Wang Xuecheng, a 25-year-old PLANAF squadron commander of the 2nd wing of the 18th regiment of the 6th division flew a Shenyang J-5 numbered 83065 from Daishan, Zhejiang to Taiwan, and under the escort of two F-5E&#x27;s, successfully landed at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Wang was rewarded a rank of major in Republic of China Air Force and 3,000 taels (approximately 150 kg) of gold. After a divorce, Wang married a local Taiwanese woman and fathered two daughters and a son. Wang still talks to his family members in Henan via telephone, and refuses to immigrate abroad like most other Chinese defectors did.
*On August 25, 1985, a PLAAF deputy wing commander Xiao Tianrun, flew an Ilyushin Il-28 from Ji&#x27;ao county, Shandong to Iri (now Iksan), and during emergency landing in the field, the navigator Sun Wuchun was killed, along with a South Korean citizen on the ground. The radio operator / tail gunner Liu Shuyi refused to defect and South Korea returned him to China along with the ashes of Sun Wuchun. On September 20, 1985, Xiao reached Taiwan and was awarded 3,000 taels (approximately 150 kg) of gold and a rank of colonel in the Republic of China Air Force. Xiao Tianrun left two copies of his declaration against communism in China and requested one of the copies to be sent to Deng Xiaoping. Xiao was personally interviewed by Chiang Ching-kuo and appeared on the Republic of China national day celebration parade in October of the same year. Xiao later married Taiwanese TV reporter Chang Te-fung, who helped Xiao greatly in his investment in Taiwanese stock market, but the pair were eventually divorced.
*On February 21, 1986, Chen Baozhong, 26, a squadron commander of the 3rd wing of the PLAAF 4th aerial reconnaissance regiment flew a reconnaissance version of Shenyang J-6 numbered 3283 from Shenyang airport to Suwon Air Base, South Korea, abandoning a training exercise. Chen reached Taiwan on April 30, 1986, and was awarded 5,000 taels (approximately 250 kg) of gold. Little is known about Chen after his honorable discharge from the Republic of China Air Force.
*On October 24, 1986, PLAAF pilot Zheng Caitian flew his Shenyang J-6 from Yantai to Seoul Air Base and when he reached Taiwan, he was awarded 5,000 taels (approximately 250 kg) of gold. Among the Chinese defecting pilots, Zheng has had the harshest life of all, because he invested in an electronic factory that went bankrupt, and lost all of his money in his subsequent investments.
*On November 19, 1987, Liu Zhiyuan, a squadron commander of PLAAF 49th division flew his Shenyang J-6 numbered 40208 from Longxi airport, Zhangzhou to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base in Taichung, Taiwan and was awarded 5,000 taels (approximately 250 kg) of gold. Liu invested heavily in the Taiwanese stock market and his assets (not including the gold rewarded to him) were once more than 10 million New Taiwan dollars (approximately 400,000 United States dollars).
*On September 6, 1989, Jiang Wenhao, a 23-year-old PLAAF lieutenant of the 2nd wing of the 145th regiment of the 49th division flew a Shenyang J-6 numbered 40307 from Longxi airport, Zhangzhou, Fujian to Kinmen Shang Yi Airport. Jiang was interviewed by the then chief-of-general-staff of Taiwanese armed forces, Hau Pei-tsun and awarded a rank of lieutenant in the Republic of China Air Force. Jiang&#x27;s financial reward, however, was reduced to 2,000 taels (approximately 100 kg) of gold from the original 5,000 taels (approximately 250 kg), because due to the reduction of tensions with China during the 1980s, Taiwan had greatly reduced the amount on September 15, 1988, in response to similar Chinese action four days earlier. (China had completely abolished any financial rewards to any Taiwanese defectors). Jiang was soon honorably discharged from the Republic of China Air Force after being promoted to captain. Jiang became a famed underwater photographer and won several awards, and he also worked as a diving instructor.
*On August 25, 1990, Wang Baoyu, a squadron commander of the 62 Air Regiment of the 21st PLAAF Air Division, defected to former USSR by flying his Shenyang J-6 to Vladivostok after taking off from Jiaohe military airport in Mudanjiang (not to be confused by the city of Jiaohe and the civilian Mudanjiang Airport at Mudangjiang). A week later, he was turned over to China along with the aircraft (according to the Soviet eyewitness of the extradition procedure, Wang was severely beaten by Chinese escort detail officers as soon as they got him from the Soviets,) and Wang Baoyu was subsequently sentenced to death, although his sentence was commuted to life in prison. The Chinese democracy movement condemned the Soviet act of returning the pilot back to China. Several high-ranking Soviet Air Defense commanders lost their jobs as a result of this defection, because Wang Baoyu was not detected until he had landed.

Note: Rewards paid in taels have been converted to mass at a rate of per &quot;new market tael&quot;.

==Cuba==
*On 4 September 1962, a Cuban pilot-instructor Jose Diaz Vasquez defected with a Zlin 326 Master-Trainer and landed at Key West, US. His trainee, Edel Ramirez Santos asked to return home.
*On March 20, 1964, a Mil Mi-4 was hijacked by crew members Guillermo Santos and Andres Izaguirre who shot dead the commander of the helicopter, Jose Garcia, and changed the course of the flight in the direction of Naval Air Station Key West, where they ultimately landed.
*On 5 October 1969, a Cuban pilot, Lieut. Eduardo Guerra Jimenez defected with his MiG-17 to Homestead Air Force Base of Miami. The plane was returned to the Cubans. Separately on June 12, 1979, ten years later, the same pilot hijacked Delta Air Lines Flight 1061 back to Havana.
*On May 28, 1987, Cuban Brigadier General Rafael Del Pino Díaz defected to the United States in a Cessna 402 airplane of Aerocaribbean, with his third wife, his daughter, and his son Ramsés, an ex-MiG-23 pilot. Del Pino Díaz remains the highest-ranking Cuban defector.
*On March 20, 1991, Cuban Major Orestes Lorenzo Pérez defected in his MiG-23BN to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida on a training mission of the Cuban Air Force. The plane was returned to the Cuban Air Force. On December 19, 1992, he returned to Cuba in a small, twin-engined 1961 Cessna 310, landing on the coastal highway of El Mamey beach in Varadero, Matanzas Province, 93 miles (149.6 km.), from Havana at the agreed time. His wife María Victoria (34), and their two sons Reyneil (11), and Alejandro (6), were already waiting on his order delivered through two Mexican women as messengers a few days before. Orestes Lorenzo Pérez picked up his family and managed a successful safe return to Marathon, Florida.

*On September 17, 1993, Cuban Captain Enio Ravelo Rodriguez, defected in his MiG-21 to Naval Air Station Key West, Florida.
*On September 23, 1993, Capt. Leonidas Basulto Serrano defected with his MiG-23 fighter to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

==Czechoslovakia==
* In 1953, Mira Slovak, a pilot for Czechoslovak Airlines, was flying a regularly scheduled flight from Prague to Brno. While en route, he overpowered the co-pilot, locked the cockpit door and dove the plane to below 1,000 feet. He flew the plane to Frankfurt, where he requested and received asylum. He later went to the United States, where he flew various aircraft, raced boats, and was a pilot for Continental Airlines.
* In 1971, stunt pilot Ladislav Bezák a winner of the FAI World Aerobatic Championships in 1960 defected by flying to West Germany. He brought his wife and four sons along in a Zlin 226 that took off in Prague and landed in Nuremberg, where all six were awarded political asylum by West Germany.

==Dominican Republic==
*In April 1959, Captain Juan de Dios Ventura Simó defected from the Dominican Air Force in a de Havilland Vampire jet. He first flew to Puerto Rico in order to ask for political asylum in the United States, but soon left the country to join a group of Dominican exiles in Venezuela. In June 1959, they organized a Cuban-backed guerrilla campaign against Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, but were quickly overwhelmed by Trujillo&#x27;s superior military force. Ventura Simó, one of the few survivors, was captured and tortured by Trujillo&#x27;s men, who organized a disinformation campaign against the opposition by claiming that Ventura Simó was not a real defector but a government spy who had led the rebels to their ruin. Once Ventura Simó was no longer useful, he was killed in prison and put on a plane which crashed at sea in order to frame the death as an aviation accident.

==Egypt==
*On January 19, 1964, Egyptian Air Force pilot Mahmud Abbas Hilmi defected from el-Arish Air Base to Hatzor Air Base in Israel in his Yakovlev Yak-11 trainer.

==Ethiopia==
* In 1976, two Ethiopian pilots defected to Sudan by flying their Northrop F-5A fighters to Kassala; the jets were returned to Ethiopia.
* In 1977, Ethiopian Air Force pilot Major Afeworki Mekonnen defected to Somalia with his English Electric Canberra bomber. The incident took place during the Ogaden War. 
* Throughout the 1980s and early 90s (up to 1991), several Ethiopian pilots defected with their planes to Sudan and Yemen.
* On 26 May 1991, the pilots of seven Mi-8s, an L-39, two An-12s, three MiG-23s, three Mi-24s and three Mi-35s defected from Ethiopia to Djibouti after the fall of the Mengistu government. The aircraft were all returned to Ethiopia on August 8.

==East Germany==
*On March 7, 1969, East German Air Force JG-1 pilot Hauptmann Gerhard Scharnetzki flew from Cottbus Air Base to Rønne Airport on Danish Bornholm Island in a Yak-18A trainer plane numbered 11.
* On May 26, 1967, Lieutenant Vasily Ilych Epatko flew his MiG-17 (No. 25) from East Germany, where he was stationed, to West Germany and made a successful belly-landing in a field near Kicklingen, Bavaria. It was almost immediately photographed by a Canadian CF-104 RECCE aircraft from 1Wing, Lahr, Germany. He was granted asylum by the United States.

==West Germany==
*On April 1, 1971, West German Army Aviation cadet-pilot Corporal Hans-Dieter Reinkensmeier defected in a small Cessna 172 to East Germany and asked for political asylum.

==Greece==
* On 11 September 1970 A Greek Air Force C-47 crossed into Soviet airspace in the area of Sevastopol in order to defect. The pilot of a Su-15 flew up alongside and rocked his wings, signaling &quot;follow me&quot;. The C-47 complied and landed at Bel&#x27;bek airbase. The Greek pilot, Captain Mikhalis Maniatakis, had stolen the aircraft from Chania airbase on Crete to flee from junta-controlled Greece. Maniatakis requested political asylum in the USSR.
* On 25 November 1973 A Greek Air Force Lieutenant-Colonel Dimitrios Zelios landed at Brindisi Airport in southwest Italy and asked for political asylum.

==Hungary==

* In August 1969 a Hungarian Air Force pilot, Maj. József Bíró defected with his MiG-15 from Taszár Air Base, Hungary, to Udine, Italy. The military tribunal stripped his rank, and sentenced to death in absentia for high treason. 
* On April 7. 1970 a Hungarian Air Force pilot, 1st Lt. Sándor Zoboki defected with his MiG-15 (serial number 907) from Taszár Air Base, Hungary, to Udine, Italy. In the same year the military tribunal stripped his rank, and sentenced to death in absentia for high treason.

==Israel==
* On 13 July 1990, at 4:30 a.m., 33-year-old Captain Haggai Mori, set out from Sde Dov Airport without permission with a Dornier Do 28 plane and attempted flight to Syria. According to Arab sources, the enemy plane was met by Syrian Air Force fighter planes and driven off from Syrian airspace. After this, Mori committed suicide. The wreckage of the missing plane was found on the western slopes of the Golan Heights, near the Syrian border. According to Israeli sources, it was assumed to have been a suicide attempt alone and not a defection.

==Iran==
*On 16 October 1982, Iranian defector Keyhan Jahanfakhr, a commercial airline pilot, asked for political asylum after landing his Iran Air Boeing 727 for a stopover in Austria.
*On 10 July 1983, Iranian defector Captain Iraj Fazeli landed a US-made F-5E Tiger II jet at an airport in Van, one of Turkey&#x27;s easternmost provinces bordering Iran. The aircraft belonged to TFB.2 at Tabriz.
*In early 1984, Iranian defectors flew an F-5E to Saudi Arabia (the pilot returned to Iran several years later). In both of these cases, the jets were back in Iran a few weeks later.
*On 30 August 1984, Iranian pilot Captain Rahman Nageeb defected in his F-4E Phantom II serial 3–6552 to Iraq, and his RIO became a POW who was later released with other prisoners.
*On 21 July 1985, Iranian pilot Mehdi Babaie and two airmen flew their US-made Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter serial 5–4089 to Iraq.
*On 31 August 1986 an Iranian top-line F-14A Tomcat fighter armed with at least one AIM-54A landed in Iraq. An Iraqi military spokesman identified the pilot and weapon systems officer (WSO) as Major Ahmed Murad Talibi and Captain Hassan Nagafi Habibullah. Upon landing, the aircraft was surrounded by up to 20 US technicians, who took care of it and the defecting pilot, while the WSO, who had opposed the defection became an Iraqi POW, was later released with other prisoners (the pilot was later killed in Europe). The F-14A along with the aforementioned F-4E were flown to Saudi Arabia by US pilots.
*On 2 September 1986, 2 Iranian F-4 Phantom and 1 F-14 Tomcat were hijacked to Iraq.

==Iraq==
*On April 2, 1960, Iraqi pilot Lt. Abbud Salim Hasan flew his British-made Hawker Hunter to Syria, where he asked for political asylum, claiming to have escaped from Communist domination in the air force.
*On November 30, 1963, Iraqi airman Lieutenant Abdel Rahim al-Salim Zuher escaped to the USSR by flying through Iran and landing at an airfield in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR. He gave as reason for his defection an unwillingness to participate in the suppression of Kurdish rebels. The aircraft type in which he defected is not known but it may have been a de Havilland Vampire. The pilot was granted political asylum.
*On 16 August 1966, Iraqi Captain Munir Redfa flew his MiG-21F-13 to Israel as a result of Mossad Operation Diamond. Two years later, Israel gave his MiG-21F-13 and two MiG-17F to the United States for evaluation under the code-name &quot;HAVE DOUGHNUT&quot; (for the MiG-21), and &quot;HAVE DRILL&quot; (for the MiG-17).
*Following Captain Munir Redfa&#x27;s defection, there were at least two Iraqi pilots who defected to Jordan with their MiG-21F-13 jets. Jordan granted them political asylum but returned the aircraft to Iraq.

<text>Gregory Scott Paul (born December 24, 1954) is an American freelance researcher, author and illustrator who works in paleontology. He is best known for his work and research on theropod dinosaurs and his detailed illustrations, both live and skeletal. Professionally investigating and restoring dinosaurs for three decades, Paul received an on-screen credit as dinosaur specialist on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;When Dinosaurs Roamed America&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot;. He is the author and illustrator of &quot;Predatory Dinosaurs of the World&quot; (1988), &quot;The Complete Illustrated Guide to Dinosaur Skeletons&quot; (1996), &quot;Dinosaurs of the Air&quot; (2001), three editions of &quot;The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs&quot; (2010, 2016 &amp; 2024), &quot;Gregory S. Paul&#x27;s Dinosaur Coffee Table Book&quot; (2010), &quot;The Princeton Field Guide to Pterosaurs&quot; (2022), &quot;The Princeton Field Guide to Mesozoic Sea Reptiles&quot; (2022) and editor of &quot;The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs&quot; (2000).

Paul&#x27;s contributions are also notable in the philosophical realm of the problem of evil.

== Paleontology ==

===Illustrations===

Paul helped pioneer the &quot;new look&quot; of dinosaurs in the 1970s. Through a series of dynamic ink drawings and oil paintings he was among the first professional artists to depict them as active, warm-blooded and – in the case of the small ones – feathered. Many later dinosaur illustrations are a reflection of his anatomical insights or even a direct imitation of his style. The fact that he worked closely with paleontologists, did his own independent paleontological research and created a series of skeletal restorations of all sufficiently known dinosaurs, lead many to regard his images as a sort of scientific standard to be followed. This tendency is stimulated by his habit of constantly redrawing older work to let it reflect the latest finds and theories. Much of it is in black-and-white, in ink or colored pencil. Sculptors have used these anatomical templates as a resource for decades, and still do today many unauthorized and uncredited. Even one of his scientific critics, Storrs L. Olson, described him in a review in the &quot;Scientific American&quot; as &quot;a superior artist&quot;. He was inspired by classic paleoartists such as Charles R. Knight, and has a fondness for the dinosaur restorations of the little-known artist Bill Berry.

Paul&#x27;s line art and paintings have been published in over 100 popular books and shown in more documentaries than other modern paleoartists including several television programs such as &quot;The Nature of Things&quot;, &quot;NOVA&quot;, &quot;Horizon&quot;, and &quot;PaleoWorld&quot;.

===Research===
From 1977 to 1984, Paul was an informal research associate and illustrator for Robert Bakker in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Paul lacks a formal degree in paleontology, but has participated in numerous field expeditions and has authored or co-authored over 30 scientific papers and over 40 popular science articles. Paul proposed that some of the bird-like feathered theropods were winged fliers, and that others were secondarily flightless, an idea supported by some fossils from China. Paul proposed the controversial thermoregulatory concept of &quot;terramegathermy&quot;, which argues that only animals with high basal metabolic rates can exceed one tonne on land. Paul has named the following dinosaurs, alone or with co-authors:

* &quot;Acrocanthosaurus altispinax&quot; (species, later renamed &quot;Becklespinax altispinax&quot;)
* &quot;Albertosaurus megagracilis&quot; (species, later renamed &quot;Dinotyrannus megagracilis&quot;, now considered a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;)
* &quot;Aublysodon molnari&quot; (species, later renamed &quot;Stygivenator molnari&quot;, now considered a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;)
* &quot;Avisaurus archibaldi&quot; (genus and species, with Brett-Surman; a bird)
* &quot;Giraffatitan brancai&quot; (genus)
* &quot;Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis&quot; (genus)
* &quot;Potamornis skutchi&quot; (genus and species, with Elzanowski &amp; Stidham; a bird)
* &quot;Dollodon bampingi&quot; (genus and species)
* &quot;Tyrannosaurus imperator&quot; (species, criticized by other paleontologists)
* &quot;Tyrannosaurus regina&quot; (species, criticized by other paleontologists)

===Books===

* &quot;Predatory Dinosaurs of the World&quot; (1988)
* &quot;The Complete Illustrated Guide to Dinosaur Skeletons&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Dinosaurs of the Air&quot; (2002)
* &quot;The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs&quot; (2010) revised 2016, 2024

* &quot;The Princeton Field Guide to Predatory Dinosaurs&quot; (2024)
* &quot;The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs&quot; (editor, 2000)

==Paul&#x27;s Statistical Problem of Evil==
Paul&#x27;s academic specialisation in paleontology brought him into disagreements over the theory of evolution, Paul asserting his belief in it. His article published in the journal Philosophy and Theology in 2007, entitled &#x27;Theodicy&#x27;s Problem: A Statistical Look at the Holocaust of the Children and the Implications of Natural Evil for the Free Will and Best of All Worlds Hypothesis&#x27; publicises Paul&#x27;s ideas surrounding the natural evil of child death. He says that statistics can be used to assess whether or not God is good based on the numbers of children that die before they can reach an age where they are able to make an informed judgement about religion. Paul rejects the idea that suffering allows us to grow and change, as many children suffer or die before they are able to do these things.
Paul concludes that the universe is not actually perfect for human flourishing, but is rather a death trap for children, and that if there is a God who created the universe, they are not worthy of worship.

<text>Ashokamitran (22 September 1931 – 23 March 2017) was the pen name of Jagadisa Thyagarajan, an Indian writer regarded as one of the most influential figures in post-independent Tamil literature. He began his prolific literary career with the prize-winning play &quot;Anbin Parisu&quot; and went on to author more than two hundred short stories, and a dozen novellas and novels. A distinguished essayist and critic, he was the editor of the literary journal &quot;Kanaiyaazhi&quot;. He has written over 200 short stories, nine novels, and some 15 novellas besides other prose writings. Most of his works have also been translated into English and other Indian languages, including Hindi, Malayalam, and Telugu.

== Life ==
Born in Secunderabad in 1931, Ashokamitran spent the first 20 years of his life there. His real name was Jagadisa Thyagarajan. He moved to Chennai in 1952 after the death of his father, following an invitation from his father&#x27;s friend, the film director S.S.Vasan to come work at Vasan&#x27;s Gemini Studios. He worked for more than a decade at the Gemini Studios. While working there he often acted as an &quot;unofficial scribe&quot; (in his own words) for people working in the film industry, and said that his efforts consisted of &quot;writing most heart rending appeals for loans and salary advances.&quot; He also began writing about his experiences working in the film industry in a set of columns for the &quot;Illustrated Weekly of India;&quot; these columns later became his book, &quot;My Years with Boss&quot; (sometimes translated as &quot;Fourteen Years with Boss&quot;). The &#x27;boss&#x27; referred to was S.S. Vasan, the owner of Gemini Studios.

His experiences here and his interaction with people from the Tamil filmdom later took the form of his book &quot;My Years with Boss&quot;. In 1966, he left his work in the film industry, and has since said that he felt he &quot;should not continue with a system which had built-in inequities.&quot;

It was from 1966 that he became a full-time writer and he took up the pseudonym of &quot;Ashokamitran&quot;. In 1973 he was invited and took part in the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, United States. In the 1980s most of his works were translated into English and he and his works became well-known all over India. Some of his works were translated into other European languages and most Indian languages as well.

Ashokamitran died on 23 March 2017 at the age of 85. At the time of his death, he was survived by his wife and three sons.

== Writing style ==
His works are characterized by simplicity and clarity of thought and drew from his professional and personal experiences. His novel &quot;Karainta nizhalkal&quot; (Star-Crossed), for instance, drew from his experiences working in public relations in the film industry at Gemini Studios. He has cited a number of writers as influencing his style, including Tamil writers B.R. Rajam Iyer, Subramania Bharti, Kothamangalam Subbu and K N Subramaniam. Most of his stories revolve around the life of middle class people. Other than Karaintha nizhalkal; Thanneer, Otran, and Pathinetaavathu atchakodu are his masterpieces. He was first to set his story in a non-Tamil milieu and “pull it off”, said Venkatachalapathy. His essays were no pushovers either, he said, adding that Ashokamitran had a flat style of writing. “He was also a voracious reader, especially of American writings,” he said. “Another standout quality was the wry humor. Today, with over 200 short stories, &quot;nine novels&quot;, and several non-fiction essays and translations, Ashokamitran is seen as a major contributor to the modern history of Tamil literature. His nonlinear and non-preachy creative works are critically seen for their subdued aesthetics and absence of extravaganza.

== Legacy ==
Ashokamitran&#x27;s life and work have been the subject of three documentary films, made by Amshan Kumar, Kandasamy, and Gnani. His novel &quot;Thanneer&quot; is being adapted for film by the director, Vasanth.

== Honours and awards ==
Ashokamitran was given many awards and honors. Some of them are: 
* The K.K. Birla Fellowship to do a study in comparative Indian literature. 
* 1973-74: The University of Iowa Creative Writing Fellowship. 
* 1992: Lily Memorial Award. 
* 1993: &quot;Ramkrishna Jaidayal Harmony Award&quot; by the Dalmia Trust for promoting religious harmony.
* 1996: Akshara Award.
* 1996: Sahitya Akademi Award for &quot;Appavin Snegidhar,&quot; a collection of short stories.

<doc id="1064056" wikidata="Q1002157" url="?curid=1064056" title="Inchicore">
<text>Inchicore () is a suburb of Dublin, Ireland. Located approximately west of the city centre, Inchicore was originally a small village separate from Dublin. The village developed around Richmond Barracks (built 1810) and Inchicore railway works (built 1846), before being incorporated into the expanding city bounds. Inchicore is a largely residential area and is home to the association football club St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic FC.

==History==
Inchicore grew from a small village near a marsh on the River Camac at &quot;Inse Chór &quot; or &quot;Inse Chaoire&quot;. Some sources suggest that &quot;Inse Chaoire&quot; means &quot;sheep island&quot;, referring to the spot where sheep were herded and watered outside Dublin city prior to market. Other sources, including the Placenames Database of Ireland, do not give a definitive source for the place name.

In the late 19th century, the village developed into a significant industrial and residential suburb, due primarily to its engineering works and the west city tramway terminus. By the 20th century, Inchicore was incorporated into the administrative area of the expanding city.
The Great Southern and Western Railway, which began constructing its network in 1844, elected to site its workshops in the then countryside at Inchicore outside the built-up suburbs of Dublin. Between the years 1846 and 1848 several houses and a Workmans Dining Hall were built on Inchicore Road. As the works complex expanded in the nineteenth-century house building in Inchicore expanded with the works being the predominant employer.

Inchicore is the location of a large tram yard terminus and coachworks and the major engineering works of the Irish railway network are located here. These are still major employers among other industries and national distribution depots.

==Geography==

 west of the city centre, south of the River Liffey, west of Kilmainham, north of Drimnagh and east of Ballyfermot, most of Inchicore is in the Dublin 8 postal district; parts of the area extend into Dublin 10 and Dublin 12.

The townlands of Inchicore North and Inchicore South are located in the civil parish of St. James, in the Barony of Uppercross.

===Rivers and streams===
The River Camac enters Inchicore flowing northeast from the Landsdowne Valley in Drimnagh. It flows east through Inchicore, and on through Kilmainham and under Bow Bridge, falling into the River Liffey under Heuston Station. Much of its course is now culverted and covered by buildings. During the eighteenth century small industries, primarily paper and textiles, developed along the Camac, which at the time was characterised by water mills, water wheels and weirs. In the 18th century, mills at Goldenbridge (Glydon Bridge) were producing paper and flour. Much of the industrial archaeology has disappeared but remnants still exist in the area. Kilmainham Mills still exists and much of the machinery is still in place. Although derelict, as of March 2021, work was underway to restore the mill as a visitor attraction.

Other watercourses in the area include the Creosote Stream, which passes through the railworks, and comes to the Liffey at the western end of the Gardens of Remembrance.

===Grand Canal===

The Grand Canal was constructed in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is now a recreational waterway. It passes along the south side of Inchicore. The path along the canal is part of a Slí na Sláinte signposted walking route. There is also an long greenway between the 3rd Lock at Inchicore and the 12th Lock at Lucan, which opened in June 2010.

== Economy ==
===Industry===
Inchicore Railway Works is the headquarters for mechanical engineering and rolling stock maintenance for Iarnród Éireann. Established in 1844 by the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway, it is the largest engineering complex of its kind in Ireland with a site area of 295,000 m2 (73 acres). Spa Road Works built trams and buses before its closure in 1977.

Goldenbridge Industrial Estate is a mixed-use area that contains, for example, a number of brewing and gym businesses.

===Amenities===
Inchicore&#x27;s core is at the junction of Emmet Road and Tyrconnell Road. The area is served by a number of small stores including a butcher and deli, a hardware store, ethnic stores, and two mid-size supermarkets. The village centre has several pubs, including the historic Black Lion Inn, and several restaurants and take-aways.

==Demographics==
As of the 2016 census, the electoral divisions of Inchicore A and Inchicore B had a combined population of approximately 4,600 people.

=== Religion ===

The Roman Catholic Church operates two parishes in the area, St. Michael&#x27;s and Mary Immaculate. Both parishes are administered by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, and each has its own church, from which they take the name.

The Oblates Church of Mary Immaculate features a full-size replica of the grotto of Lourdes, which was opened in 1930. The grotto, which is built of reinforced concrete, houses a crib at Christmas time.

St. Jude&#x27;s Church (Church of Ireland), was an Anglican church built between 1862 and 1864 to serve the community working in the railway works. Only the octagonal spire remains, following the dismantling of the church in 1988.

==Governance==
Inchicore is in the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council and for council elections, forms part of the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh Ward. As of the 2024 local elections, the local elected representatives on the City Council were:
* Daithí Doolan (Sinn Féin)
* Vincent Jackson (Non-Party)
* Hazel de Nortúin (People Before Profit)
* Philip Sutcliffe (Independent Ireland)
* Ray Cunningham (Green Party)

==Culture==

There are two community centres, St Michael&#x27;s and BERA. Arus Mhuire was for many years the location of a popular Sunday night dance for teenagers.

The area used to form part of the parish of St. James, later in a union, and served by St. James&#x27; Church, but this church has been deconsecrated, and the attached cemetery is closed and overgrown. In 2010, 7 historic parishes, in three unions, all grouped as the St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral Group, were severed from the cathedral and established as the new Parish of St. Catherine and St. James with St. Audeon, served by St. Audeon&#x27;s Church, Cornmarket, and St. Catherine and St. James&#x27; Church on Donore Avenue.

=== Arts ===
Inchicore has been home to a number of poets. Michael Hartnett, lived on Tyrconnell Road from 1984 until about 1986. A plaque marks the house where he wrote some of Inchicore Haiku near Richmond Park, home to St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic Football Club. &#x27;Inchicore Haiku&#x27; recounts the hard times in his life after his separation from his family.

Francis Ledwidge, the First World War war poet, has associations with St. Michael&#x27;s CBS, formerly Richmond Barracks. This is where he enlisted and trained before shipping out to Flanders. The Inchicore Ledwidge Society runs events to raise awareness of Ledwidge&#x27;s life and works, and holds an annual wreath-laying ceremony in the Irish National War Memorial Gardens.

Another Irish poet, Thomas Kinsella (1928–2021), was born and lived on Phoenix Street in Inchicore as a child. He attended the local Model School.

The tramp writer Jim Phelan (1895–1966) was born in Inchicore. On completing 15 years in prison for his part in the murder of a post mistress&#x27;s son in a robbery in Liverpool in 1923, Phelan roamed the byways of England and wrote several books about his prison experience. The artist Sean Scully (b. 1945) was also born in Inchicore and moved to London When he was four years old.

The courts-martial of a number of figures in the 1916 Rebellion, including poet Patrick Pearse, took place in Richmond Barracks. A number of surviving buildings of the barracks have been restored, with the former gymnasium redeveloped ahead of the 1916 centenary celebrations. It contains wall panels and a tapestry that highlight the people court martialled there.

=== Parks ===

The parks in the area include Grattan Crescent Park and Jim Mitchell Park, which hold playgrounds, as well as Turvey Park, and the park grounds adjoining the Mary Immaculate Catholic Church. To the south, there is Lansdowne Valley Park.

The Irish National War Memorial Gardens, containing a monument designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, lies just to the north of Inchicore; there is an Inchicore entrance on Con Colbert Road. It commemorates the fallen Irish of the Great War. Official record books held in museum buildings there are inscribed with the names of those who gave their lives. The gardens are also accessible from the South Circular Road, en route toward Phoenix Park, which can be accessed by crossing over Islandbridge (Sarah Bridge).

===Museums===
There is a museum at Richmond Barracks, which reopened in May 2016 as part of the centenary celebrations of the Easter Rising. Prisoners were taken to Richmond Barracks for processing after the surrender of the insurgents in 1916. Nearby Kilmainham Jail, now a national museum, was the scene of the execution of leaders of Easter Rising of 1916. The Irish Museum of Modern Art, housed in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, is also nearby.

Goldenbridge Cemetery, accessible via guided tours from the nearby Richmond Barracks, was the first dedicated Catholic cemetery in Ireland that opened after Catholic Emancipation. It opened in 1828, shortly before the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. Goldenbridge is the burial place of modern Ireland&#x27;s first head of government, President of the Executive Council W. T. Cosgrave, who died in 1965.

== Education ==

Primary schools in the area include Gaelscoil Inse Chor, Scoil Mhuire Gan Smál (Oblates) NS, Our Lady of Lourdes NS, and Inchicore National School. The restored &#x27;Model School&#x27; (Inchicore NS) was built in 1853 as a prototype facility for government funded non-denominational primary school education in Ireland.

Secondary schools serving the area include Mercy Secondary School. This co-educational Catholic school, under the trusteeship of CEIST, is located on Thomas Davis Street West, off Emmet Road. It is a member of the Trinity Access Programme (TAP) and the international College For Every Student (CFES) programme. The school has won CFES &quot;School of Distinction&quot; several times.

The Inchicore College of Further Education is located at Emmet Road in Inchicore.

Inchicore Public Library offers club activities (including a film club, book club, knitting club, and poetry club).

== Sports ==

===Soccer===

St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic (founded in 1929 and commonly known as &quot;St. Pat&#x27;s&quot;) play in Richmond Park. St. Pat&#x27;s has played in Inchicore since 1930 (save for time spent exiled due to ground redevelopment). The club has won the League of Ireland Championship on nine occasions. 

Former St. Pat&#x27;s players include Paul McGrath, Ronnie Whelan Snr., Shay Gibbons, Gordon Banks, Curtis Fleming, Paul Osam, Eddie Gormley, Charles Livingstone Mbabazi, Ryan Guy, Keith Fahey, Kevin Doyle, Christy Fagan, Chris Forrester and Ian Bermingham. St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic host a number junior and intermediate sides at Inchicore, including Lansdowne Rangers, Inchicore Athletic and West Park Albion.

===Gaelic games===
The 1889 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final between Tipperary and Laois was played at what is now the Inchicore Sports and Social Club.

Liffey Gaels GAA club was founded in 1951. It was known as Rialto Gaels for over twenty years. In the 1970s, it changed its name to SS. Michael and James&#x27;s to reflect the efforts of the teachers and students of these schools in the development of the club. In 1984, a local juvenile club, Donore Iosagain, amalgamated with SS. Michael and James&#x27;s and the club was renamed the Liffey Gaels. The club plays home games at East Timor Park on Sarsfield Road in Inchicore.

===Other sports===
Men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, boys and girls basketball teams are based in Oblate Hall.

==Infrastructure==
Inchicore is accessed by multiple roads and served by a range of Dublin Bus services. Although the site of Ireland&#x27;s main railway service yards, it has no mainline rail service, but it is served by the Luas tramway system, which runs along its filled-in permanent way, and serves the area from Blackhorse to Suir Bridge.

Inchicore is passed on its southern edge by the Grand Canal, developed by economic progressives of the day and that was, at its peak, the major passenger and commercial trading route through central Ireland, running through the productive farmlands and peat bogs of the Irish midlands. Originally carrying significant traffic during the eighteenth century, it is now a recreational waterway.

<text>Object-Oriented Fortran was an object-oriented extension of Fortran produced by Absoft Corporation as part of their series of Fortran compilers. In Object-Oriented Fortran, data items could be grouped into objects, which can be instantiated and executed in parallel. It was available for Sun, Iris, iPSC, and nCUBE, but is no longer supported.

Object-oriented features are now fully integrated into standard Fortran, since Fortran 2003.

<text>Woodstock is a 1970 American documentary film of the watershed counterculture Woodstock Festival which took place in August 1969 near Bethel, New York.

The film was directed by Michael Wadleigh in his directional debut. Seven editors are credited, including Thelma Schoonmaker, Martin Scorsese, and Wadleigh. &quot;Woodstock&quot; was a great commercial and critical success. It received the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Schoonmaker was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, a rare distinction for a documentary. Dan Wallin and L. A. Johnson were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound. The film was screened at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.

The 1970 theatrical release of the film ran 185 minutes. A director&#x27;s cut spanning 224 minutes was released in 1994. Both cuts take liberties with the timeline of the festival. However, the opening and closing acts are the same in the film as they appeared on stage; Richie Havens opens the show and Jimi Hendrix closes it.

In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

An expanded 40th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Woodstock&quot;, released on June 9, 2009, in Blu-ray and DVD formats, features additional performances not before seen in the film, and it includes lengthened versions of existing performances, such as Creedence Clearwater Revival.

==Release==
The film opened at 7 theaters in the United States and Canada on March 26, 1970 (Boston, Coral Gables, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto and Washington D.C.) and set opening day house records in each one with grosses totalling $41,633. It opened at a further theater in New York City on April 1.
==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Woodstock&quot; received universal acclaim from newspaper and magazine critics in 1970. It was also an enormous box-office smash. The edition of May 20, 1970 of &quot;Variety&quot; reported it was doing well in its third week in Chicago and San Francisco. In each of those metropolitan areas the movie played at only one cinema during that week, but many thousands showed up. Eventually, after it branched out to more cinemas including more than one per metropolitan area, it grossed $50 million in the United States. The budget for its production was just $600,000, making it not only the fifth highest-grossing film of 1970 but one of the most profitable movies of that year as well.

Decades after its initial release, the film earned a rare 100% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.58/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;By documenting arguably the most renowned music festival in history, &quot;Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music&quot; achieves the rare feat of capturing the unique spirit of its time.&quot;

In his original 1970 review, Roger Ebert rated the movie 4 stars (out of 4) and described it as &quot;maybe the best documentary ever made in America&quot;, adding &quot;The remarkable thing about Wadleigh&#x27;s film is that it succeeds so completely in making us feel how it must have been to be there&quot;. In 2005 Ebert added &quot;Woodstock&quot; to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list and wrote a retrospective review that stated, &quot;&quot;Woodstock&quot; is a beautiful, moving, ultimately great film...Now that the period is described as a far-ago time like &quot;the 1920s&quot; or &quot;the 1930s,&quot; how touching it is in this film to see the full flower of its moment, of its youth and hope.&quot;

In 1996, &quot;Woodstock&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In the science fiction thriller &quot;The Omega Man&quot; (1971), Colonel Robert Neville (played by Charlton Heston) is seen traveling to a movie theatre in Los Angeles to screen the film for himself alone. &quot;Woodstock&quot; had been a recent film debuting prior to release of &quot;The Omega Man&quot;, and had been held over (continuously run) in some theaters for months. Neville darkly remarks the film is so popular it was &quot;held over for the third straight year&quot;. As he repeats some of the dialogue verbatim, it is clear that Neville has repeated the ritual many times during the two years that he has believed himself to be the last man alive on Earth.

In a 2009 review, Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; graded the DVD release A−, stating &quot;Wadleigh crafted a film with a thoughtful flow; it tells the full story of the event, from the paranoia (and eventual acceptance) of the locals to the helpful attitudes (and eventual paranoia) of the throng. Woodstock runs for more than 20 minutes before Wadleigh even gets to any of the performances, and throughout the film, he cuts away to interviews and montages that map out the scope of the mini-community formed at Woodstock, in all its glories and sadness.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called this film the benchmark of concert movies and one of the most entertaining documentaries ever made.

===25th Anniversary Director&#x27;s Cut (1994)===

Upon the festival&#x27;s 25th anniversary, in July 1994, a 224 minutes director&#x27;s cut of the film — subtitled &quot;3 Days of Peace &amp; Music&quot; — was released theatrically in cinemas and later on DVD. It added over 40 minutes and included additional performances by Canned Heat, Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplin. Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s set at the end of the film was also extended with two additional numbers.

After the closing credits — featuring Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s &quot;Find the Cost of Freedom&quot; — a list of prominent people from the &quot;Woodstock Generation&quot; who had died is shown, including John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Che Guevara, Martin Luther King Jr., Mama Cass Elliot, Jim Morrison, John Lennon, Max Yasgur, Roy Orbison, Abbie Hoffman, Paul Butterfield, Keith Moon, Bob Hite, Richard Manuel, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. It ends with the epitaph to the right:

<doc id="1064072" wikidata="Q379598" url="?curid=1064072" title="Advanced Host Controller Interface">
<text>The Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is a technical standard defined by Intel that specifies the register-level interface of Serial ATA (SATA) host controllers in a non-implementation-specific manner in its motherboard chipsets.

The specification describes a system memory structure for computer hardware vendors to exchange data between host system memory and attached storage devices. AHCI gives software developers and hardware designers a standard method for detecting, configuring, and programming SATA/AHCI adapters. AHCI is separate from the SATA 3 Gbit/s standard, although it exposes SATA&#x27;s advanced capabilities (such as hot swapping and native command queuing) such that host systems can utilize them. For modern solid state drives, the interface has been superseded by NVMe.

The current version of the specification is 1.3.1.

== Operating modes ==
Many SATA controllers offer selectable modes of operation: legacy Parallel ATA emulation (more commonly called IDE Mode), standard AHCI mode (also known as Native Mode), or vendor-specific RAID (which generally enables AHCI in order to take advantage of its capabilities). Intel recommends choosing RAID mode on their motherboards (which also enables AHCI) rather than AHCI/SATA mode for maximum flexibility. Legacy mode is a software backward-compatibility mechanism intended to allow the SATA controller to run in legacy operating systems which are not SATA-aware or where a driver does not exist to make the operating system SATA-aware.

When a SATA controller is configured to operate in IDE Mode, the number of storage devices per controller is usually limited to four (two IDE channels, master device and slave device with up to two devices per channel), compared to the maximum of 32 devices/ports when configured in AHCI mode. But the chipset SATA interfaces may emulate more than one &quot;IDE controller&quot; when configured in IDE Mode.

== Operating system support ==
AHCI is supported out of the box on Windows Vista and later, Linux-based operating systems (since version 2.6.19 of the kernel), OpenBSD (since version 4.1), NetBSD (since version 4.0), FreeBSD (since version 8.0), macOS, GNU Mach, ArcaOS, eComStation (since version 2.1), and Solaris 10 (since version 8/07). DragonFlyBSD based its AHCI implementation on OpenBSD&#x27;s and added extended features such as port multiplier support. Older versions of operating systems require hardware-specific drivers in order to support AHCI. Windows XP and older do not provide AHCI support out of the box.

=== System drive boot issues ===
Some operating systems, notably Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, do not configure themselves to load the AHCI driver upon boot if the SATA controller was not in AHCI mode at the time the operating system was installed. Although this is an easily rectifiable condition, it remains an ongoing issue with the AHCI standard.

The most prevalent symptom for an operating system (or systems) that are installed in IDE mode (in some BIOS firmware implementations otherwise called &#x27;Combined IDE mode&#x27;), is that the system drive typically fails to boot, with an ensuing error message, if the SATA controller (in BIOS) is inadvertently switched to AHCI mode after OS installation. In Microsoft Windows the symptom is a boot loop which begins with a Blue Screen error, if not rectified.

Technically speaking, this is an implementation bug with AHCI that can be avoided, but it has not been fixed yet. As an interim resolution, Intel recommends changing the drive controller to AHCI or RAID before installing an operating system. (It may also be necessary to load chipset-specific AHCI or RAID drivers at installation time, for example from a USB flash drive).

On Windows Vista and Windows 7, this can be fixed by configuring the codice_1 device driver to start at boot time (rather than on-demand). Setting non-AHCI mode (i.e. IDE or Combined mode) in the BIOS will allow the user to boot into Windows, and thereby the required registry change can be performed. Consequently, the user then has the option of continuing to use the system in Combined mode or switching to AHCI mode.
Inter alia with Windows 10 and 8, this can be fixed by forcing the correct drivers to reload during Safe Mode.

In Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012, the controller driver has changed from codice_1 to codice_3, and the procedures to upgrade to the AHCI controller is similar to that of Windows 7. On Windows 8, 8.1 and Windows Server 2012, changing from IDE mode to AHCI mode without first updating the registry will make the boot drive inaccessible (i.e. resulting in a recurring boot loop, which begins with a Blue Screen error).

In Windows 10, after changing the controller to AHCI mode, if the OS is allowed to reboot a couple of times after the start of the boot loop, which starts with an INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE BSOD, Windows presents recovery options. Out of the Advanced options, if Startup Repair option is selected, Windows attempts to fix the issue and the PC begins to function normally.

A similar problem can occur on Linux systems if the AHCI driver is compiled as a kernel module rather than built into the kernel image, as it may not be included in the initrd (initial RAM disk) created when the controller is configured to run in Legacy Mode. The solution is either to build a new initrd containing the AHCI module, or to build the AHCI driver into the kernel image.

Power management is handled by the Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM) protocol.

<text>Edwin Sidney Savage (28 February 1862 — 26 October 1947) was a British priest in the Church of England and an author.

Born in Port Elizabeth South Africa, Savage was educated at New College, Eastbourne, University College London and Magdalen College, Oxford.

Savage married Jane McEwan, who died on 23 November 1886 following the birth of their only child, Ronald McEwan Hill Savage. He married secondly, in 1889, Sibil Farrar, daughter of Frederic Farrar, Dean of Canterbury (1895-1903); they had a son (Lieutenant Cuthbert Savage, killed in action during World War I) and four daughters (Enid, Audrey, Rosella and Elflida).

Savage was the Rector of Hexham from 1898 to 1919, during which time he oversaw the abbey&#x27;s rebuilding.

After serving with 21 ships during the First World War as Chief Commissioner of YMCA in the Mediterranean, Savage was decorated with the Serbian Red Cross Order for services in relief of its civilian population. He also received the Order of St Sava as well as the honorary military rank of major from King Peter I of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He was also honoured with the Serbian Orthodox Church&#x27;s Golden Cross, whose insignia of a large pectoral cross in repousse gold he later often wore. He also served on the International Commission to report on the Bulgarian Atrocities.

On the evening of 26 October 1947, Savage was found dead in a smoke-filled room after raising the alarm for a fire in his sitting room at 18 London Road in Bexhill, a town he had been associated with for the previous 20 years. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death but his cause of death remains in doubt as there was no evidence of burning.

Other achievements:

*Constructor of the Abbey Institute in Gilesgate Hexham, now home to the Hexham Community Centre
*Restorator and conservator of the Church of St Bartholomew the Great, Smithfield, during his term as rector (1929–1944)
*Honorary chaplain to the Worshipful Companies of Butchers and Makers of Playing Cards
*Honorary canon of Newcastle Cathedral

<text>Whiskey-class submarines (known in the Soviet Union as [[Whiskey-class submarine|Projects 613, 640, 644, and 665]]) are a class of diesel-electric attack submarines that the Soviet Union built in the early Cold War period.

==Design==


The initial design was developed in the early 1940s as a sea-going follow-on to the S-class submarine. As a result of war experience and the capture of German technology at the end of the war, the Soviet Union issued a new design requirement in 1946. The revised design was developed by the Lazurit Design Bureau based in Gorkiy. Like most conventional submarines designed between 1946 and 1960, the design was heavily influenced by the World War II German Type XXI U-boat.

Between 1949 and 1958 a total of 215 submarines of this type were commissioned into the Soviet Navy. The vessels were initially designed as coastal patrol submarines. These patrol variants are known in the west as Whiskey I, II, III, IV, and V and were called Project 613 in the Soviet Union.

*Whiskey I − twin  guns mounted on the conning tower
*Whiskey II − twin  guns and twin 25 mm guns
*Whiskey III − guns removed
*Whiskey IV − 25 mm guns and fitted with a snorkel
*Whiskey V − no guns - streamlined conning tower and snorkel, most Whiskey-class were modified to this variant

===Missile variants===

In the 1950s and 1960s, some Whiskey submarines were converted to guided missile submarines, with the capability to fire one to four SS-N-3 Shaddock cruise missiles. In 1956, the first prototype was ready. It was a regular Whiskey class modified with a launch tube aft of the sail containing a single SS-N-3c. This vessel was known in the West as Whiskey Single Cylinder. Between 1958 and 1960, six additional Whiskey-class submarines were converted to carry guided missiles. These boats had two missile tubes behind the sail, and were known in the west as the Whiskey Twin Cylinder, and Project 644 boats by the Soviets.

Between 1960 and 1963, six boats received an extended sail that could contain four Shaddock missiles. These were called Whiskey Long Bin in the West and Project 665 in the Soviet Union. All guided missile variants of the Whiskey class carried the P-5/ NATO SS-N-3c Shaddock land-attack missile, and had to surface in order to fire their missiles. The boats of the single and twin cylinder class also had to raise their missile tubes, which were normally positioned horizontally.

The &quot;Long Bin&quot; boats did not handle well, with the launch tubes causing stability problems, and water flow around the missile fittings was very noisy. All were soon retired from service. Some were converted to Project 640 radar picket boats (called Whiskey Canvas Bag in the West). While others were converted for intelligence-gathering missions. In the Soviet Navy, the patrol variants of this class were replaced by the . The guided missile variants were replaced by the .

==Production programme==
The Soviet Union built a total of 236 or 215 Whiskeys (sources vary; it appears the initial 21 Chinese-built boats are often included with the Soviet boats). Vice Admiral Burov, head of the Soviet Defense Ministry&#x27;s Shipbuilding Institute from 1969 to 1983, confirms 215 units built.

==Operators==

The Whiskey-class had a long service life, with 45 still on the active list of the Soviet Navy in 1982. All Whiskey-class submarines are now decommissioned.

* − 4 vessels were left behind by the Soviets in 1961 following their expulsion from the country. Only two were operational in 1991. Three were sold as scrap metal while as of 2022, the Albanian government was considering converting the remaining submarine into a museum ship 
* − 2
* − 26 vessels, 21 of which were built locally with Soviet-supplied parts as the Type 03 
* − 7 
* − 14 
* − 4 vessels, remained in the Korean People&#x27;s Army Navy inventory as late as 2004 
* − 4 
* − 20 were still in active service in 1991

==Incidents involving Whiskey-class submarines==
* On 27 January 1961, was lost due to accidental flooding while the boat was submerged. The valve that should have prevented water from entering the snorkel did not work properly.
* In 1961, when Enver Hoxha decided to expel all Soviet personnel from Albania, four submarines were sabotaged by their former crews before being abandoned. They were later repaired by Chinese technicians and returned to service in 1964.
* On 24 November 1972, the of the Royal Norwegian Navy had &quot;contact&quot; with what they presumed was a Whiskey-class submarine, after 14 days of &quot;hunt&quot; in Sognefjord. Military documents released in 2009 confirmed this episode.
* On 21 October 1981, was run down by the merchant vessel &quot;Refrizherator-13&quot; in Golden Horn Bay, Vladivostok.
* On 27 October 1981, ran aground in Swedish territorial waters near the Karlskrona naval base.
*On 19 June 1984, a Whiskey-class submarine was caught in a fishing-net and surfaced within the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
* On 14 December 1989 a decommissioned Whiskey-class submarine under tow for scrapping in Nakskov was sunk west of Bornholm. Attempts to raise it in 1991 failed and it sunk nearby in deeper water.
* On 5 February 2007, the decommissioned took on water and sank off the coast of Denmark while being towed to become part of a naval museum.
* In 2009 a previously unknown and unidentified sunken Whiskey-class submarine was discovered within Sweden&#x27;s EEZ close to the island of Gotland. It was a decommissioned submarine which sank while under tow to be scrapped in Denmark. News of the discovery was not made public until March 2011.

==Surviving examples==
&quot;S-189&quot; is preserved as a museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. (ex-&quot;S-290&quot;) is preserved in Surabaya, Indonesia. , Albania&#x27;s #105 existed at Pasha Liman Base in south Albania, though it was deteriorating.

<text>Total external reflection is a phenomenon traditionally involving X-rays, but in principle any type of electromagnetic or other wave, closely related to total internal reflection.

Total internal reflection describes the fact that radiation (e.g. visible light) can, at certain angles, be totally reflected from an interface between two media of different indices of refraction (see Snell&#x27;s law). Total internal reflection occurs when the first medium has a larger refractive index than the second medium, for example, light that starts in water and bounces off the water-to-air interface.

Total external reflection is the situation where the light starts in air and vacuum (refractive index 1), and bounces off a material with index of refraction less than 1. For example, in X-rays, the refractive index is frequently slightly less than 1, and therefore total external reflection can happen at a glancing angle. It is called &quot;external&quot; because the light bounces off the exterior of the material. This makes it possible to focus X-rays.

<text>William Daniel Heffernan (born 3 March 1943), is an Australian former politician who was a Liberal Party member of the Senate representing the state of New South Wales from September 1996 to May 2016.

==Early life and background==
Heffernan was born in Junee, New South Wales, and attended St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill. He has qualifications in wool classing and welding from Wagga Wagga Technical College and has been a farmer in the Junee area for 30 years. Heffernan lives with his wife, Margaret.

Heffernan was a member of the Junee Shire Council 1981–96 and was President of the Council 1989–90 and 1991–93. He was active in the Liberal Party for many years and was the party&#x27;s NSW State President 1993–1996.

He unsuccessfully ran for the Liberal Party in the 1993 federal election for the seat of Riverina.

==Political career==

In September 1996, the NSW Parliament appointed Heffernan to replace Liberal Senator Michael Baume, whose resignation created a casual vacancy. Heffernan had been a long-time friend and supporter of then Prime Minister John Howard in the NSW Liberal Party, and in October 1998, after he was elected in his own right to a six-year term in the Senate, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet, a position giving him easy access to the Prime Minister.

He was involved in bringing the first and second readings of the bill which became the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;.

He was reelected twice, in 2004 and 2010, and was the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries, Rural &amp; Regional Affairs Policy Committee, Member of Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport and Member of the Joint House Committee.

In 2007 Heffernan was appointed Chairman of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Taskforce to examine the potential and opportunities for further land and water development in Northern Australia.

On 17 March 2008, Senator Heffernan announced the establishment of a Senate Inquiry looking at the implications for Australian farmers of world chemical and fertiliser supply and pricing arrangements, monopolistic and cartel behaviour and related matters. In the same month Heffernan announced the establishment of a Senate Inquiry into Meat Marketing. The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport looked at the need for effective supervision of national standards and controls and the national harmonisation of regulations applying to the branding and marketing of meat.

On 12 November 2008, Senator Heffernan announced that a Senate Inquiry would be launched to examine gene patents, saying: &quot;Patents should be for inventions, not for naturally occurring genes.&quot; The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs was to inquire into the granting of patent monopolies in Australia over human and microbial genes and non-coding sequences, proteins and their derivatives. Heffernan said &quot;the granting of gene patents has the potential to have a detrimental impact on healthcare costs, medical research, provision of training and accreditation for healthcare professionals as well as the health and wellbeing of all Australians.&quot; &quot;Patents should be for inventions not for naturally occurring genes, these patents will disrupt future breast and prostate cancer testing and research&quot;, Heffernan said. Following the launch of the Senate Inquiry into Gene Patents by Heffernan, Mervyn Jacobsen, the founder and 40 per cent shareholder of the Melbourne company Genetic Technologies, which holds the patents for BRCA1 and BRCA2, backed down from threatened legal action.

On 19 February 2016, Heffernan announced he would not be a candidate at the 2016 federal election, and would retire at the end of his current term. His term ended at the double dissolution of 9 May 2016.

===Criticisms of public figures===

====Justice Kirby and subsequent parliamentary censure====
On 12 March 2002, speaking in the Senate under parliamentary privilege, Heffernan made accusations against a serving judge. Only at the end of this speech did Heffernan make it clear that the judge he was referring to was Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court of Australia. Senators John Faulkner and Robert Ray (Labor) and Aden Ridgeway (Australian Democrats) each alleged that Heffernan had deliberately structured his speech this way in order to conceal the fact that he was violating parliamentary standing orders. Standing Order 193 prohibits senators from making &quot;imputations of improper motives or personal reflections&quot; on currently serving judicial officers.

Heffernan&#x27;s allegations against Kirby included the inappropriate use of a Commonwealth car to solicit sex from an under-age male prostitute, and to support these claims he produced what appeared to be a driver&#x27;s log book recording the alleged trip. The documents were found to be a forgery. Heffernan came under prolonged political pressure as a result of this episode, and was eventually asked by Prime Minister John Howard to resign his post as Parliamentary Secretary, which he did. On 19 March, he made a statement to the Senate in which he withdrew the claims. Immediately following this statement, Heffernan was censured by the Senate &quot;on the voices&quot;. The Prime Minister was also censured for his involvement in the episode by an amendment to the censure motion which passed 31–30, with Coalition government senators voting against it. The censure motion read as follows:
:That the Senate—
::(a) notes that:
:::(i) on 13 March 2002 the Deputy President (Senator West) ruled that Senator Heffernan&#x27;s speech on the address-in-reply debate on 12 March 2002 was in breach of standing order 193, in that it contained offensive words, imputations of improper motives and personal reflections on a judicial officer, and
:::(ii) the ruling recorded that Senator Heffernan&#x27;s speech was so structured that it was impossible for the chair to detect that the speech was in breach of the standing orders until the very end of the speech; and
::(b) censures Senator Heffernan for:
:::(i) breaching standing order 193 by his reckless and highly disorderly attack on a judicial officer,
:::(ii) making such serious allegations on the basis of insubstantial evidence,
:::(iii) failing to refer all the alleged evidence in his possession to the proper authorities for investigation prior to making his allegations in the Parliament,
:::(iv) recklessly disregarding resolution 9 of the Senate&#x27;s Privileges Resolutions (of 25 February 1988) which require senators to balance their responsibilities with the rights of others, and
:::(v) abusing the trust of senators by speaking in such a manner that neither the chair nor senators could detect that he was in the process of breaching standing order 193.
::(c) censures the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for not preventing Senator Heffernan&#x27;s reckless and abusive actions in the Senate and for not acting immediately, after 12 March 2002, to reverse the effect of those actions.

====People from Irish backgrounds====
At a Senate Estimates Hearing in Canberra, Heffernan called the Irish-born head of Qantas, Alan Joyce, &quot;an old Irish bomb maker&quot;, saying &quot;Mr Joyce, if the power was yours, you know from being an old Irish bomb maker, if you had the choice, what would be the ideal pilot training?&quot; During the hearing, he also made comments about having a beer in a three-minute break and there being no whisky in the water. He made similar comments to Liberal party member Julian McGauran, saying &quot;Senator McGauran are you, do you come from a long line of Irish bomb-makers, do you?&quot;

====Coalition colleagues====
On 7 February 2006, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Heffernan had been forced to apologise to National Party senator Fiona Nash after a public altercation at Canberra Airport the previous day, during which he had told her to &quot;blow it out her backside&quot;. Senator Heffernan said the airport altercation with his fellow Coalition Senator was just &quot;a bit of colour and movement&quot;. But National Party MP De-Anne Kelly described the incident as &quot;workplace harassment&quot;, saying &quot;workplace harassment is not acceptable anywhere&quot;.

On 7 July 2006, the ABC program &quot;Stateline&quot; in NSW aired claims that Heffernan was involved in the downfall of former NSW opposition leader John Brogden. Alex McTaggart, independent member for Pittwater, his wife Denise, and Peter Jones, a member of McTaggart&#x27;s campaign team, claimed on the program that Heffernan contacted them and said that he was the Prime Minister&#x27;s [Howard&#x27;s] right-hand man, and did his &#x27;dirty work&#x27;. The McTaggarts claimed that Heffernan told them he had a dirt file on Brogden, said that Brogden needed to be &#x27;paid back&#x27;, and tried to lure them into publicising material damaging to Brogden&#x27;s character. Heffernan denied these claims, and was quoted on the program saying that they were &#x27;bullshit&#x27;.

On 20 May 2012 allegations were reported in the media that Heffernan struck a fellow Liberal party member and suspended electoral officer, Ray Carter, so hard that he was toppled onto a chair, before allegedly whispering to him &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you were a poofter.&quot; during a branch meeting on 3 May. The president of the NSW Liberal Party, fellow New South Wales Senator Arthur Sinodinos, dismissed the allegations.

====Wood Royal Commission====
In 2015, Heffernan used parliamentary privilege to allege that he had a document, allegedly produced to the Wood Royal Commission, that listed the names of 28 people, including prominent lawyers, suspected of visiting a &quot;boy brothel&quot; in Kings Cross. He stated in parliament that a former Prime Minister was among the names.

====Other use of controversial language====
In a public lecture given on 27 September 2005, political opponent Mark Latham accused Heffernan of engaging in the &quot;politics of personal destruction&quot;, and quoted John Hewson (a former Liberal Party leader) as saying that John Howard had used Heffernan to distribute dirt and to run his agenda against individuals &quot;for almost as long as I have known him&quot;.

In October 2006, Heffernan called for &quot;someone&#x27;s arse to get kicked&quot; because of delays to the construction of the final major link in the dual carriageway between Sydney and Melbourne. According to Heffernan, a &quot;colony of whatever they are that live in the edge of the bank of the creek&quot; (platypus) was causing the delay and it was a problem that could be fixed &quot;in ten minutes&quot;. He called for consultants to be axed if they were &quot;wasting taxpayers&#x27; money&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine in May 2007, Senator Heffernan repeated previously stated views that priests should be able to marry because &quot;... priests, like the rest of us, wake up with a horn at four in the morning.&quot;

In the same &quot;Bulletin&quot; interview, Heffernan caused widespread outrage by suggesting the unmarried and childless Deputy Leader of the Opposition Julia Gillard was unfit for leadership because she was &quot;deliberately barren&quot;. He continued: &quot;I mean, anyone who chooses to remain deliberately barren ... they’ve got no idea what life&#x27;s about.&quot; Heffernan later apologised for the remarks.

&quot;The Bulletin&quot; published an interview which quoted Heffernan as stating that Australia had to &quot;settle the north&quot; because millions of people in Asia may find it a &quot;very attractive proposition&quot; if climate change leaves them water-poor. Heffernan later denied he had made such claims but &quot;The Bulletin&quot; stood by the accuracy of its report, citing an audio recording of the Heffernan interview.

On 2 December 2014, during the parliament&#x27;s last sitting week of the year, Heffernan rang the office of Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm in order to get Leyonhjelm to drop his threat to block government legislation if the Coalition party-room failed to allow a conscience vote on his (Leyonhjelm&#x27;s) bill to legalise same-sex marriage. When Leyonhjelm later appeared in the Senate chamber, Heffernan called him a &quot;terrorist&quot;, to which Leyonhjelm responded by telling Heffernan to &quot;fuck off&quot;, three times.

===Practical jokes===
During the New South Wales 2007 state election, Heffernan was accused of stealing Greens how-to-vote cards and misrepresenting Greens policies to voters. He was reported as shouting &quot;If you want to decriminalise drugs for your children, vote Green&quot;. Police were called but he was not arrested.

According to &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper, in 2007 Heffernan posed as an ASIO agent in a telephone call to John Grabbe, a farm manager in New South Wales. Under the Crimes Act it is an offence to impersonate a Commonwealth officer.

On 30 August 2010, Heffernan admitted being the caller who rang NSW independent MP Rob Oakeshott, and introduced himself as &quot;the devil&quot;. The phone call was answered by Oakeshott&#x27;s wife, who assumed it was a prank call and hung up, before Heffernan gave his name. Oakeshott accused the Liberal-National Coalition of dirty tactics and described the introduction as &quot;Rambo-style&quot;. Heffernan said he had been introducing himself as such for a while.

Heffernan is also reported to have impersonated Senator Barnaby Joyce during a telephone conversation with one of his constituents.

On 26 May 2014, Heffernan smuggled an imitation pipe bomb into Parliament House and presented it at a Senate hearing, arguing it showed the new security arrangements at Parliament were inadequate. Previously, everybody entering Parliament House had to undergo security checks. Under the new system, Members of Parliament, their staff and family, as well as parliamentary staff can enter the building without being scanned, and their belongings unchecked. In response, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner Tony Negus admitted passholders bringing in unauthorised objects &quot;is a risk&quot;, but that the AFP regularly consults with parliamentary officials about appropriate security measures.

<text>, or Taisetsuzan is located in the mountainous center of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaidō. At , Daisetsuzan is the largest national park in Japan, and is approximately the size of Kanagawa Prefecture. Daisetsuzan itself means &quot;great snowy mountains&quot; in reference to the park&#x27;s peaks. There are 16 peaks over in Daisetsuzan National Park, both with and without trails. The park offers some of the most rugged scenery in Japan. Asahidake (), located in the north of the park, is the highest peak in Hokkaidō. Daisetsuzan National Park spans two subprefectures of Hokkaidō, Kamikawa and Tokachi. Daisetsuzan National Park was established in 1934.

==Mountain groups==

Daisetsuzan National Park consists of three volcanic mountain groups. The groups consist of stratovolcanoes piled on top of each other. As one vent becomes active, it builds a peak then stops until a new vent appears. These groups are:

#Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group — lies in the northern part of the park and includes Hokkaidō&#x27;s tallest mountain, Mount Asahi.
#Tokachi Volcanic Group — lies in the southwest of the park north of the Yubari and Hidaka Mountains. It includes Mount Tokachi
#Shikaribetsu Volcanic Group — lies in the eastern part of the park and includes Mount Ishikari. The Ishikari River (), which emerges from Mount Ishikari, is the third longest in Japan and the longest in Hokkaidō.

These volcanic groups lie around a central highlands dominated by Mount Tomuraushi. The park is also known for its alpine meadows and remote backcountry.

==Nature==

Daisetsuzan National Park is famous for its wildlife, and the park is home to several rare species. The park is notably home to a population of brown bears. The pika, a small mammal, with short limbs, rounded ears, and no external tail, is also found in the park. The forests of Daisetsuzan National Park are dominated by the &quot;Picea jezoensis&quot;, the Jezo spruce, and the &quot;Abies sachalinensis&quot;, the Sakhalin fir. Of the 450 species of alpine plants found in Hokkaidō, half are found in Daisetsuzan National Park.

==Onsen==

Daisetsuzan National Park also includes the onsen hot spring resorts of Asahidake Onsen, Fukiage Onsen, Sōunkyō Onsen and Tenninkyo Onsen.

<text>Louth is a village on the eastern side of the Darling River in New South Wales, Australia. The village is in Bourke Shire, south west of Bourke and north west of Cobar. The town is made famous by the Louth Races which are held in August each year, attracting crowds of nearly five thousand. At the 2021 census, Louth and the surrounding region had a population of 74.

The town was established in 1859 when Thomas Andrew Mathews, an Irish immigrant from County Louth, built a pub to serve the passing trade along the then busy Darling River. At one stage the town grew to have three hotels, a cordial factory, three bakeries, two butchers, a post office, three churches, a Chinese garden, a general store and a police station. The post office still remains and has been beautifully restored.

When T.A. Mathew&#x27;s first wife, Mary Mathews, died in 1886, he had a unique headstone built that is now an Australian National Monument. At dusk each night, the cross reflects the setting sun across the town acting as a beacon of light that on the anniversary of her death lights up the doorstep of where her family home once stood.

In 1888 the first mechanised shearing of sheep, in the world, took place at Sir Samuel McCaughey&#x27;s &quot;Dunlop&quot; Station, a property located within the Louth district.

<doc id="1064114" wikidata="Q779168" url="?curid=1064114" title="Halfdan Ragnarsson">
<text>Halfdan Ragnarsson (; or &quot;Healfdene&quot;; ; died 877) was a Viking leader and a commander of the Great Heathen Army which invaded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England starting in 865.

Halfdan was one of six sons of Ragnar Lodbrok named in Norse sagas; his brothers and half-brothers included Björn Ironside, Ivar the Boneless, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, Ubba and Hvitserk. Because Halfdan is not mentioned in any source that mentions Hvitserk, some scholars have suggested that they are the same individual – a possibility reinforced by the fact that Halfdan was a relatively common name among Vikings and &quot;Hvitserk&quot; &quot;white shirt&quot; may have been an epithet or nickname that distinguished Halfdan from other men by the same name.

Halfdan was the first Viking King of Northumbria and a pretender to the throne of the Kingdom of Dublin. It is also possible he was for a time co-ruler of Denmark with his brother Sigurd Snake-in-the-eye, because Frankish sources mention a certain Sigfred and Halfdan as rulers in 873. He died at the Battle of Strangford Lough in 877 trying to press his Irish claim.

==Biography==
Halfdan was one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army which invaded the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia in 865. According to the Norse sagas this invasion was organised by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok (Halfdan being one of them), to wreak revenge against Ælla of Northumbria. Ælla had supposedly had Ragnar executed in 865 by throwing him in a snake pit, but the historicity of this explanation is unknown. The invaders are usually identified as Danes, although the tenth-century churchman Asser stated that the invaders came &quot;de Danubia&quot;, which translates as &quot;from the Danube&quot;; the fact that the Danube is located in what was known in Latin as &quot;Dacia&quot; suggests that Asser actually intended &quot;Dania&quot;, a Latin term for Denmark.

In the autumn of 865 the Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia, where they remained over the winter and secured horses. The following year the army moved northwards and invaded Northumbria, which was at that time in the middle of a civil war between Ælla and Osberht, opposing claimants for the Northumbrian throne. Late in 866 the army conquered the rich Northumbrian settlement of York. The following year Ælla and Osberht made an alliance to retake the town. The attack was defeated, and both of them fell in the battle. With no obvious leader, Northumbrian resistance was crushed and the Danes installed a puppet-king, Ecgberht, to rule in their name and collect taxes for them.

Later in the year the Army moved south and invaded the Kingdom of Mercia, capturing the town of Nottingham, where they spent the winter. The Mercian king, Burghred, responded by allying with the West Saxon King Æthelred, and with a combined force they laid siege to the town. The Anglo-Saxons were unable to recapture the city, but a truce was agreed whereby the Danes would withdraw to York. where they remained for over a year, gathering strength for further assaults.

The Danes returned to East Anglia in 869, this time intent on conquest. They seized Thetford with the intention of remaining there over the winter, but they were met by an East Anglian army. The East Anglian army was defeated and its commander, King Edmund, was slain. Medieval tradition identifies Edmund as a martyr who refused the Danes&#x27; demand to renounce Christ, and was killed for his steadfast Christianity. Ivar and Ubba are identified as the commanders of the Danes, and the killers of Edmund, and it is unknown what part, if any, Halfdan took.

Following the conquest of East Anglia Ivar apparently left the Great Heathen Army – his name disappears from English records after 870. However, he is generally considered to be identical to Ímar, a Norse King of Dublin who died in 873. With Ivar in Ireland, Halfdan became the main commander of the Army, and in 870 he led it in an invasion of Wessex. Sometime after Ivar left the Army a great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by Bagsecg, bolstering the ranks of Halfdan&#x27;s army. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the Danes battled the West Saxons nine times, including at the Battle of Ashdown on 8 January 871. However, the West Saxons could not be defeated, and Halfdan accepted a truce from Alfred, newly crowned king of Wessex.

The Army retreated to the captured town of London and stayed there over the winter of 871/872. Coins minted in London during this period bear the name Halfdan, identifying him as its leader. In autumn of 872 the Army returned to Northumbria to quell a revolt against its puppet-regent Ecgberht. However, this explanation for the army&#x27;s move north has been challenged, and it has been suggested the relocation was a result of a war with Mercia. The Army overwintered at Torksey, and was then reported as being in the Repton district a year later. It conquered Mercia in 874, the Mercian King Burghred being deposed and replaced by a Danish-puppet regent, Ceolwulf.

Following this victory the Army split in two – one half under Guthrum heading south to continue fighting against Wessex, the other half under Halfdan heading north to fight against the Picts and Britons of Strathclyde. According to the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, Eystein Olafsson, King of Dublin was &quot;deceitfully&quot; killed in 875 by &quot;Albann&quot;, a figure generally agreed to be Halfdan. His brother Ivar had ruled the city prior to his death in 873 and it appears Halfdan&#x27;s campaigning was an attempt to regain his brother&#x27;s lost kingdom. Halfdan did not remain in Ireland: in 876 he and his forces returned to Northumbria, and settled an area largely coextensive with the old Kingdom of Deira, with the northern part of Northumbria remaining under Anglian rule. Sources sometimes title Halfdan King of Jórvík, beginning in 876.

Halfdan&#x27;s rule of Dublin was not secure, and he was deposed while away in York. He returned to Ireland in 877 to try to recapture the city, but he was met with an army of &quot;Fair Heathens&quot; – a contentious term usually considered to mean the Viking population who had been in Ireland the longest, as opposed to the newly arrived &quot;Dark Heathens&quot;, of whom Halfdan was one. The forces met at the Battle of Strangford Lough, where Halfdan was slain. Those of Halfdan&#x27;s men who survived the battle returned to Northumbria via Scotland, fighting a battle along the way in which Constantine I, King of the Picts was killed. The Vikings of Northumbria remained kingless until 883, when Guthred was made king there.

==Historicity==
Halfdan and his supposed brothers are, individually, considered historical figures, although there is no contemporary mention of them being related, and opinion regarding his supposed father is divided. According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, writing in 1979, &quot;certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar&#x27;s story as based on historical fact&quot;. Katherine Holman, on the other hand, concludes that &quot;although his sons are historical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived, and he seems to be an amalgam of several different historical figures and pure literary invention.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
* In the 2020 video game, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla&quot;, Halfdan appears along with his brothers, Ivar and Ubba. In the game, he is seen warring against the Picts in Northumbria and reaches out to the game&#x27;s protagonist, Eivor, who helps him rat out a traitor, and later sees him crowned king of Northumbria. He is portrayed by Norwegian actor, Jeppe Beck Laursen, who also portrays Thor in the game.

<text>ObjVlisp is a 1984 object-oriented extension of Vlisp–Vincennes LISP, a LISP dialect developed since 1971 at the University of Paris VIII – Vincennes. It is noteworthy as one of the earliest implementations of the concept of metaclasses, and in particular explicit (as opposed to implicit) metaclasses. In the ObjVlisp model, &quot;each entity is an instance of a single class. Classes are instances of other classes, called metaclasses. This model allows for extension of the static part of OOL, i.e. the structural aspects of objects considered as implementation of abstract data types&quot;

ObjVlisp provided a far more flexible metaclass model than that provided by earlier object-oriented languages, especially Smalltalk. In Smalltalk-80, whenever a new class is created, a corresponding metaclass is created automatically; it does not have a name independent of that of the metaclass for which it was created–metaclasses are implicit rather than explicit. By contrast, in ObjVlisp, it is possible to define named metaclasses, and when defining a class one must specify which named metaclass it will instantiate.

The explicit metaclass support in ObjVlisp influenced the provision of the same capability in the Common Lisp Object System.

The ObjVlisp object model was later implemented in Prolog to produce ObjVProlog. Both Python and Converge implement a meta-class system that is equivalent of that of ObjVLisp.

<doc id="1064122" wikidata="Q858279" url="?curid=1064122" title="Puffinus">
<text>Puffinus is a genus of seabirds in the order Procellariiformes that contains about 20 small to medium-sized shearwaters. Two other shearwater genera are named: &quot;Calonectris&quot;, which comprises three or four large shearwaters, and &quot;Ardenna&quot; with another seven species (formerly often included within &quot;Puffinus&quot;).

The taxonomy of this group is the cause of much debate, and the number of recognised species varies with the source.

The species in this group are long-winged birds, dark brown or black above, and white to dark brown below. They are pelagic outside the breeding season. They are most common in temperate and cold waters.

These tubenose birds fly with stiff wings, and use a shearing flight technique to move across wave fronts with the minimum of active flight. Some small species, such as the Manx shearwater, are cruciform in flight, with their long wings held directly out from their bodies.

Many are long-distance migrants, perhaps most spectacularly the sooty and short-tailed shearwaters, which perform migrations of 14,000 km or more each year.

&quot;Puffinus&quot; shearwaters come to islands and coastal cliffs only to breed. They are nocturnal at the colonial breeding sites, preferring moonless nights to minimise predation. They nest in burrows and often give eerie contact calls on their night-time visits. They lay a single white egg.

They feed on fish, squid and similar oceanic food. Some will follow fishing boats to take scraps, notably the sooty shearwater; these species also commonly follow whales to feed on fish disturbed by them.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Puffinus&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the Manx shearwater (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;) as the type species.

Traditionally, &quot;Puffinus&quot; has been grouped with the &quot;Procellaria&quot; and &quot;Calonectris&quot; shearwaters. However, more recent results have determined that the genus is apparently paraphyletic and while in part very close to &quot;Calonectris&quot;, forms a clade with the genera &quot;Pseudobulweria&quot; and &quot;Lugensa&quot;, which were formerly presumed to be gadfly petrels, and can be divided in what has been called the &quot;Puffinus&quot; and the &quot;Neonectris&quot; group after notable species; the latter has been separated as a distinct genus named &quot;Ardenna&quot;. The former is taxonomically confusing, with species having been split and remerged in the last years.

&quot;Puffinus&quot; is a Neo-Latin loanword based on the English &quot;puffin&quot;. The original Latin term for shearwaters was usually the catchall name for sea-birds, &quot;mergus&quot;. &quot;Puffin&quot; and its variants, such as poffin, pophyn and puffing, 
referred to the cured carcass of the fat nestling of the shearwater, a former delicacy. The original usage dates from at least 1337, but from as early as 1678 the term gradually came to be used for another, unrelated, seabird, the Atlantic puffin, an auk. The current English name was first recorded in 1835 and refers to the former nesting of this species on the Isle of Man.

===Extant species===
The genus &quot;Puffinus&quot; contains the following 21 species:
===Phylogeny===
Phylogeny of the genus based on a study by Joan Ferrer Obiol and collaborators published in 2022. Only 14 of the 21 recognised species were included.
===Fossil record===
Several fossil species which became extinct long ago are also known. The proportion of larger (&quot;Neonectris&quot;) species apparently was larger before the Pliocene, i.e. before marine mammals diversified:
* &quot;Puffinus&quot; group
** Menorcan shearwater, &quot;Puffinus&quot; sp. (prehistoric) – possibly extirpated population of extant species; tentatively placed in this group
** Dune shearwater or Hole&#x27;s shearwater, &quot;Puffinus holeae&quot; (prehistoric)
** Lava shearwater or Olson&#x27;s shearwater, &quot;Puffinus olsoni&quot; (prehistoric) – tentatively placed in this group
** Bermuda shearwater, &quot;Puffinus parvus&quot; (extinct) – tentatively placed in this group; possibly synonymous with &quot;P. lherminieri&quot;
** Scarlett&#x27;s shearwater, &quot;Puffinus spelaeus&quot; (prehistoric)
** &quot;Puffinus tedfordi&quot; (Pleistocene of western North America)
** &quot;Puffinus nestori&quot; (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene of Ibiza)
* &quot;Neonectris&quot; group
** &quot;Puffinus&quot; sp. 1 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, US)
** &quot;Puffinus&quot; sp. 2 (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, US)
* Unassigned:
** &quot;?Puffinus raemdonckii&quot; (Early Oligocene of Belgium) – formerly in &quot;Larus&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus micraulax&quot; (Early Miocene of C Florida, US) – probably &quot;Puffinus&quot; group
** &quot;Puffinus&quot; sp. (Early Miocene of Calvert County, US)
** &quot;Puffinus&quot; sp. (Early Pliocene of South Africa)
** &quot;Puffinus felthami&quot; (Pleistocene of W North America)
** &quot;Puffinus kanakoffi&quot; (Pleistocene of W North America)
** &quot;&quot;Puffinus&quot; aquitanicus&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus antiquus&quot; 
** &quot;Puffinus barnesi&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus calhouni&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus diatomicus&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus inceptor&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus mitchelli&quot;
** &quot;Puffinus priscus&quot;

&quot;&quot;Puffinus&quot; arvernensis&quot; (Early Miocene of France) is now considered a primitive albatross of the fossil genus &quot;Plotornis&quot;. Some other species like &quot;P. conradi&quot; and &quot;P. pacificoides&quot; have been reclassified as those of &quot;Ardenna&quot;.

<doc id="1064124" wikidata="Q454653" url="?curid=1064124" title="Helena Modjeska">
<text>Helena Modrzejewska (; born Jadwiga Helena Mizel; October 12, 1840 – April 8, 1909), known professionally in the United States as Helena Modjeska, was a Polish-American actress who specialized in Shakespearean and tragic roles. 

She was successful first on the Polish stage. After emigrating to the United States (and despite her poor command of English), she also succeeded on stage in America and London. She is regarded as the greatest actress in the history of theatre in Poland. She was also a member of the Pacific Coast Women&#x27;s Press Association and was mother of a prominent Polish-American engineer Ralph Modjeski.

==Early life==
Helena Modjeska was born in Kraków, Poland, on 12 October 1840. Her birth name was recorded as Jadwiga Benda, but she was later baptized Helena Opid.

The question of Helena Modjeska’s paternity and identity has been a subject of controversy and myths from the very beginning, often perpetuated by Modjeska herself. Helena’s mother was Józefa Benda, née Mizel. Her parents were Karol Mizel (Müzel) and Katarzyna Golc (Goltz), both of whom came from German mining families that arrived at the end of the 18th century to work in the mines in Szczakowa. Józefa was born in Wróblowice, lost her father at an early age, and was taken in by the Radwański family, the owners of the nearby Swoszowice estate. They provided her with an education, brought her to Kraków, and arranged her marriage to Szymon Benda in 1824.

Szymon Benda and Józefa had three sons: Józef Szymon, Jan Szymon, and . Benda passed away in 1835 at the age of 63, leaving his wife and sons a substantial estate, including two interconnected tenement houses at the corner of Grodzka and Szeroka Streets (now Dominikański Square). A few years after his death, Józefa became involved with a municipial clerk, Michał Opid, an admirer of music and classical literature, who was married to Anna Krzyczkiewicz. From this marriage, he had a son Adolf. From the relationship between Józefa Mizel and Michał Opid, Helena was born in 1838, followed by her younger sister, Józefa Michalina, in 1842. Adolf Opid was two years older than Helena and the closest to her among all the siblings.

For a long time, a popular rumor suggested that Modjeska&#x27;s father was Prince Władysław Hieronim Sanguszko—a hero of the November Uprising and a wealthy landowner. The basis of this speculation was likely the resemblance in appearance and life paths between Modjeska and Sanguszko’s acknowledged daughter, also , who was also an actress, renowned for both her beauty and scandalous lifestyle.

Michał Opid died around 1845, when Helena was 5 years old. The tenement in which she and her family lived burned down in the great fire of Kraków in 1850, which could not be rebuilt. The family moved into the flat of Dr Schanzer, father of the actress Marie von Bülow, and Helena and her sister Józefina were sent to the school of the Presentation Sisters. In 1850 or 1851, the sisters began to take private German lessons from G Gustaw Zimajer, an actor, who fostered in Helena the interest in theatre that had been awakened by her brothers, especially Feliks.

Also glossed over in Modjeska&#x27;s autobiography were the details concerning her first marriage, to her former guardian, Gustave Sinnmayer (Polish: Gustaw Zimajer). Gustave was an actor and the director of a second-rate provincial theater troupe. The date of Modjeska&#x27;s marriage to Gustave is uncertain. She discovered many years later that they had not been legally married, because he was still married to his first wife when they wed. Together the couple had two children, a son Rudolf (later renamed Ralph Modjeski), and a daughter Marylka, who died in infancy.

Gustaw Zimajer used the stage name &quot;Gustaw Modrzejewski.&quot; It was the feminine form of this name that Modjeska adopted when she made her stage debut in 1861 as Helena Modrzejewska. Later, when acting abroad, she simplified her name to &quot;Modjeska&quot;, which was easier for English-speaking audiences to pronounce.

In her early Polish acting career, Modrzejewska played at Bochnia, Nowy Sącz, Przemyśl, Rzeszów and Brzeżany. In 1862 she appeared for the first time in Lwów, playing in her first Romantic drama, as &quot;Skierka&quot; in Juliusz Słowacki&#x27;s &quot;Balladyna&quot;. From 1863 she appeared at Stanisławów and Czerniowce, in plays by Słowacki.

In 1865 Zimajer tried to get her a contract with Viennese theaters, but the plan came to naught due to her poor knowledge of the German language. Later that year Helena left Zimajer, taking their son Rudolf, and returning to Kraków. Once there she accepted a four-year theatrical engagement. In 1868 she began appearing in Warsaw; during her eight years there, she consolidated her status as a theater star. Her half-brothers Józef and Feliks Benda were also well-regarded actors in Poland.

One incident illustrates the restrictions of nineteenth century Polish society. At one of Modrzejewska&#x27;s Warsaw performances, seventeen secondary-school pupils presented her with a bouquet of flowers tied with a ribbon in the red-and-white Polish national colors. The pupils were accused by the Russian Imperial authorities of conducting a patriotic demonstration. They were expelled from their school and banned from admission to any other school. One of the pupils, Ignacy Neufeld, subsequently shot himself; Modrzejewska attended his funeral.

==Chłapowski==
On September 12, 1868, Modjeska married a Polish nobleman, Karol Bożenta Chłapowski. Best known in America as &quot;Count Bozenta,&quot; he was not a count. His family belonged to the untitled landed gentry (&quot;ziemiaństwo&quot;). In the United States he adopted the stage name &quot;Count Bozenta&quot; as a ploy to gain publicity. &quot;Bozenta&quot; was easier for an English-speaking audience to pronounce than &quot;Chłapowski.&quot;

At the time of their marriage, Chłapowski was employed as the editor of a liberal nationalist newspaper, &quot;Kraj&quot; (The Country), which was owned by Adam Sapieha and a Mr. Sammelson. Modjeska wrote that their home &quot;became the center of the artistic and literary world [of Kraków].&quot; Poets, authors, politicians, artists, composers and other actors frequented Modjeska&#x27;s salon.

==Immigration==

In July 1876, after spending more than a decade as the reigning diva of the Polish national theater, for reasons both personal and political, Modjeska and her husband chose to immigrate to the United States.

Once in America, Modjeska and her husband purchased a ranch near Anaheim, California. Julian Sypniewski, Łucjan Paprowski, and Henryk Sienkiewicz (winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1905), were among the friends who had accompanied them to California. It was during this period that Sienkiewicz wrote his &quot;Charcoal Sketches (Szkice węglem).&quot; Originally the artists Stanisław Witkiewicz (father of Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz) and Adam Chmielowski (the future St. Albert) were also to have come with Modjeska&#x27;s group, but they changed their plans. She was a member of the Pacific Coast Women&#x27;s Press Association.

Modjeska intended to abandon her career and envisioned herself living &quot;a life of toil under the blue skies of California, among the hills, riding on horseback with a gun over my shoulder.&quot; The reality proved less cinematic. None of the colonists knew the first thing about ranching or farming, and they could barely speak English. The utopian experiment failed, the colonists went their separate ways, and Modjeska returned to the stage, reprising the Shakespearean roles that she had performed in Poland. Perhaps the best account of daily life on the ranch is Theodore Payne&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Life on the Modjeska Ranch in the Gay Nineties&quot;.

==American career==
On 20 August 1877, Modjeska debuted at the California Theatre in San Francisco in an English version of Ernest Legouvé&#x27;s &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot;. She was seen by theatrical agent Harry J. Sargent who signed her for a tour on the east coast where she made her New York debut. She then spent three years abroad (1879–82), mainly in London, attempting to improve her English, before returning to the stage in America. In 1880, she visited the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall and on hearing that the parish church of Ruan Minor was in need of an organ she collaborated with Mr J Forbes-Robertson to put on a performance. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was performed on a temporary stage in the vicarage garden and watched by many local people. A resident of Penzance and soon-to-be member of parliament for the St Ives constituency, Charles Campbell Ross, played the part of Friar Laurence.

Despite her accent and imperfect command of English, she achieved great success. During her career, she played nine Shakespearean heroines, Marguerite Gautier in &quot;Camille&quot;, and Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuart&quot;. In 1883, the year she obtained American citizenship, she produced Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky, the first Ibsen play staged in the United States. In the 1880s and 1890s, she had a reputation as the leading female interpreter of Shakespeare on the American stage.

In 1893, Modjeska was invited to speak to a women&#x27;s conference at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, and described the situation of Polish women in the Russian and Prussian-ruled parts of dismembered Poland. This led to a tsarist ban on her traveling in Russian territory.

Modjeska suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed in 1897, but recovered and soon returned to the stage, continuing to perform for several additional years.

During her last stay in Poland, from 31 October 1902 to 28 April 1903, she appeared on the stage in Lwów, Poznań, and her native Kraków.

On 2 May 1905, she gave a jubilee performance in New York City. Then she toured for two years and ended her acting career, afterward only appearing sporadically in support of charitable causes.

Modjeska died at Newport Beach, California on 8 April 1909, aged 68, from Bright&#x27;s disease. Her remains were sent to Kraków to be buried in the family plot at the Rakowicki Cemetery.

Her autobiography &quot;Memories and Impressions of Helena Modjeska&quot; was published posthumously in 1910. A Polish translation ran the same year in the Kraków newspaper &quot;Czas&quot; (Time). The last Polish edition of the book appeared in 1957.

Modrzejewska&#x27;s son, Rudolf Modrzejewski (Ralph Modjeski), was a civil engineer who gained fame as a designer of bridges.

==Legacies==

Arden, Modjeska&#x27;s home from 1888 to 1906, is a registered National Historic Landmark.

Named for her are:
* Modjeska Park in Anaheim, California (33°48&#x27;53&quot;N 117°57&#x27;8&quot;W)
* Helene Street in Anaheim, California
* Modjeska Canyon, California (where Arden is located)
* Modjeska Falls, California, at the Glen Alpine Springs Resort
* Modjeska Peak (the north peak of Saddleback Mountain).
* Bouquet Helena Modjeska by American perfumer John Blocki of Prussian and Polish descent
* Modjeskas, a caramel-covered marshmallow confection invented in 1889 by a local candy-maker named Anton Busath (and later made by other candy-makers, including Bauer&#x27;s Candies, Muth&#x27;s Candies and Schimpff&#x27;s Confectionery) in her honor when she visited Louisville, Kentucky.
* A street in Wrocław, formerly named after the German actress Agnes Sorma when the city was part of Germany as Breslau.
* Modjeska Youth Theater Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
* A Pullman car, the Helena Modjeska, was named for her.
* SS Helena Modjeska, a 7,000 ton US cargo steamer that ran aground on Goodwin Sands in 1946.

A statue of Modjeska is located outside the Pearson Park Amphitheater in Anaheim, California.

Modjeska was the mother of bridge engineer Ralph Modjeski and godmother to artist-author-philosopher Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (son of artist Stanisław Witkiewicz, who almost accompanied Modjeska and her family to California in 1876). She was also the aunt of artist Władysław T. Benda.

She was godmother to American actress Ethel Barrymore.

==Roles==
Modjeska&#x27;s chief tragic roles were:
* William Shakespeare:
** Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;
** Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;
** Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot;
** Queen Anne in &quot;Richard III&quot;
* Nora in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;
* Luisa Miller in Salvadore Cammarano&#x27;s Luisa Miller
* Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuart&quot; and &quot;Princess Eboli&quot;
* Marion Delorme in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Marion Delorme&quot;
* Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Tisbé&quot;
* Juliusz Słowacki&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuart&quot; and &quot;Mazeppa&quot;

Modrzejewska was also the Polish interpreter of the more prominent plays by Ernest Legouvé, Alexandre Dumas, père and fils, Émile Augier, Alfred de Musset, Octave Feuillet and Victorien Sardou.

Her favorite comedy rôles were Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing, and Donna Diana in the Polish translation of an old Spanish play of that name.

==In literature==
Susan Sontag&#x27;s award-winning 1999 novel &quot;In America&quot;, though fiction, is based on Modjeska&#x27;s life. The book precipitated a controversy when Sontag was accused of having plagiarized other works about Modjeska.

Modjeska was a character in the novella &quot;My Mortal Enemy&quot; by Willa Cather.

Scholars Joanna and Catharina Polatynska have posited that Modjeska might have been Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s model for the character Irene Adler, the only woman that Sherlock Holmes came close to loving. In &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, Doyle mentions Adler having been prima donna of the fictional Imperial Opera of Warsaw in the same years when Modjeska was at the peak of her theatrical career in Warsaw, and the fictional character&#x27;s personality recalls that of the actual actress.

==Death anniversary==
In 2009, in honor of the 100th anniversary of her death, the Historical Museum of the City of Kraków presented the exhibition &quot;Helena Modjeska (1840–1909): For the Love of Art&quot; (8 April – 20 September 2009). The Warsaw staging of the same exhibition ran from October 2009 through January 2010. The exhibition included items from the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California.

===Google Doodle===
To commemorate the 181st anniversary of her birth on 12 October 2021, a Google Doodle paid homage to Modjeska.

<text>Le Lisp (also Le_Lisp and Le-Lisp) is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp.

==Programming language==
It was developed at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA), to be an implementation language for a very large scale integration (VLSI) workstation being designed under the direction of Jean Vuillemin. &quot;Le Lisp&quot; also had to run on various incompatible platforms (mostly running Unix operating systems) that were used by the project. The main goals for the language were to be a powerful post-Maclisp version of Lisp that would be portable, compatible, extensible, and efficient.

Jérôme Chailloux led the &quot;Le Lisp&quot; team, working with Emmanuel St. James, Matthieu Devin, and Jean-Marie Hullot in 1980. The dialect is historically noteworthy as one of the first Lisp implementations to be available on both the Apple II and the IBM PC.

On 2020-01-08, INRIA agreed to migrate the source code to the 2-clause BSD License which allowed few native ports from ILOG and Eligis to adopt this license model.

<text>Secondary metabolism (also called specialized metabolism) is a term for pathways and small molecule products of metabolism that are involved in ecological interactions, but are not absolutely required for the survival of the organism. These molecules are sometimes produced by specialized cells, such as laticifers in plants. Secondary metabolites commonly mediate antagonistic interactions, such as competition and predation, as well as mutualistic ones such as pollination and resource mutualisms. Examples of secondary metabolites include antibiotics, pigments and scents. The opposite of secondary metabolites are primary metabolites, which are considered to be essential to the normal growth or development of an organism.

Secondary metabolites are produced by many microbes, plants, fungi and animals, usually living in crowded habitats, where chemical defense represents a better option than physical escape. It is very hard to distinguish primary and secondary metabolites due to often overlapping of the intermediates and pathways of primary and secondary metabolism. As an example can serve sterols, that are products of secondary metabolism, and, at the same time, represent a base for a cell structure.

<doc id="1064133" wikidata="Q3041865" url="?curid=1064133" title="Dvaita Vedanta">
<text>Dvaita Vedanta (); (originally known as Tattvavada; IAST: &quot;Tattvavāda&quot;), is a sub-school in the Vedanta tradition of Hindu philosophy. The term Tattvavada literally means &quot;arguments from a realist viewpoint&quot;. The Tattvavada (Dvaita) Vedanta sub-school was founded by the 13th-century Indian philosopher-saint Madhvacharya. Madhvacharya believed in three entities: God, &quot;jiva&quot; (soul), and &quot;jada&quot; (&quot;maya&quot;, matter). The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that God and the individual souls (jīvātman) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct, being said that Vishnu (Narayana) is independent (&quot;svatantra&quot;), and Souls are dependent (&quot;paratantra&quot;) on him.

The Dvaita school contrasts with the other two major sub-schools of Vedanta, the Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara which posits nondualism—that ultimate reality (Brahman) and human soul (Ātman) are identical and all reality is interconnected oneness, and Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja which posits qualified nondualism—that ultimate reality (Brahman) and human soul are different but with the potential to be identical. Sanyasis of the Dvaita Vedanta tradition belong to the ēkadaṇḍi order.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dvaita&quot; (द्वैत) is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;duality, dualism&quot;. The term refers to any premise, particularly in theology on the material and the divine, where two principles (truths) or realities are posited to exist simultaneously and independently. Indologist B. N. Krishnamurti Sharma says: &quot;The English term &quot;Dualism&quot; is inadequate to express the full content and depth of meaning that Madhva has put into the term &quot;Dvaita&quot;, as it is to be implied to his system. Even the Sanskrit word &quot;Dvaita&quot; is not literally capable of expressing more than the fundamental principles accepted. B. N. K. Sharma suggested to use the term &quot;Svatantra-Advitiya-Brahmavāda&quot; as an alternative name to Madhva&#x27;s system. Sharma says, Satyadhyana Tirtha of Uttaradi Math approved this. B. N. K. Sharma further states that &quot;the term &quot;Svatantra-Advitiya-Brahmavāda&quot; is capable of conveying directly rather than by implication or definition, the highest reach of its thought and its metaphysical ideology do often stressed by Madhva and so well expounded by Jayatirtha&quot;. It may be seen that such a term would do justice to both the aspects of reality—the finite and the infinite&quot;.

Quoting the term &quot;Advitīyatva&quot;, Sharma also states that &quot;the term &quot;Advitīyatva&quot; has been interpreted by Madhva, in the &quot;Chandogya Bhashya&quot;, in terms of &quot;absence of peer and superior&quot; to Brahman, conceding by implication, the existence, the reality of &quot;lesser reals&quot; like matter and souls under the aegis of God. The first part of the text has been taken to emphasize the unity of God-head by excluding internal distinctions of substance and attributes in Brahman in conformity with text like &quot;नेह नानास्ति किंचना&quot;, which are understood as nagating some internal distinctions (&quot;nānātva&quot;) alone in Brahman. The only internal distinctions that are logically conceivable in Brahman, are those of attributes. This is negated by the way of significant negation. The adjunct &quot;Svatantra&quot; would thus serve to emphasize the transcendence of the supreme over the other reals and its immanence in them and show how the conception of Brahman, here, differs from the &quot;Nirviśeṣādvaita&quot; of Adi Shankara. Quoting the term &quot;Svatantra-Advitiya-Brahmavāda&quot;, Sharma also says: &quot;It would also stand terminologically balanced with the distinctions of other Vēdantic systems like &quot;Nirviśeṣādvaita&quot;, &quot;śuddhādvaita&quot;, and &quot;Viśiṣṭādvaita&quot;. It would also lay direct emphasis on the primacy of the supreme as the &quot;Para-Siddhanta&quot; of the Madhva&#x27;s thought, and put the teachings about the finite in their proper place as constituting the &quot;Apara-Siddhānta&quot; (subsidiary truths)&quot;.

Aluru Venkata Rao opines that the term &quot;Dvaita&quot; is not suitable for Madhva&#x27;s philosophy, hence it should not be used. Instead, he suggests to use the term &quot;Pūrnabrahmavāda&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the Vedas systematized by the 13th-century Indian philosopher-saint Madhvacharya, which espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the only independent reality (&quot;svatantra-tattva&quot;), states the Dvaita school, is that of Vishnu as the ultimate reality (Brahman) and Supreme God. Vishnu is the supreme Self, in a manner similar to the monotheistic God in other major religions. He is believed to be almighty, eternal, always existing, everlasting, all-knowing, and compassionate. The second reality is that of dependent (&quot;asvatantra-tattva&quot; or &quot;paratantra&quot;) but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul, matter, and the like exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy, as opposed to monistic Advaita Vedanta, is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.

Like Ramanuja, Madhvacharya also embraced Vaishnavism. Madhvacharya posits God as being personal and &quot;saguna&quot;, that is endowed with attributes and qualities (in human terms, which are not believed to be able to fully describe God). To Madhvacharya, the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas was Vishnu. He stated: &quot;Brahmaśabdaśca Viṣṇaveva&quot;, that Brahman can only refer to Vishnu. Scriptures which say different are declared as non-authoritative by him. To him, Vishnu was not just any other deva, but rather the one and only Supreme Being. According to him, the devas are souls of deceased persons who were rewarded for good deeds by being reincarnated into the heavenly worlds and becoming following organs of God&#x27;s will, which would also be the case with Vayu and Lakshmi. He also believes that they are mortal, and that some of them could sink into lower stages of existence after death. Therefore, he believes that only God shall be worshipped through them, and that worshipping them on their own behalf is an apostasy which emerged during Treta Yuga, and did not yet exist during Satya Yuga. According to him, this must also be noticed regarding murtis.

=== &quot;Jivas&quot; ===
Dvaita Vedanta acknowledges two principles; however, it holds one of them (the sentient) as being eternally dependent on the other. The individual souls (&quot;jiva&quot;) are depicted as reflections, images or shadows of the divine, but never in any way (even after &quot;moksha&quot;, or liberation) identical with the divine. Being a reflection of God, each &quot;jiva&quot; has a nature with some characteristics (truth, conscious, bliss) of God in varying degree which is under the influence of &quot;karma&quot; in bondage and expands to its distinct full intrinsic capacity in &quot;moksha&quot;. Liberated &quot;jivas&quot; do not attain equality with Brahman and also are not equal to each other.

Five fundamental, eternal and real differences are described in Dvaita school:
# Between the individual souls (or jīvātman) and God (paramathma or Vishnu).
# Between matter (inanimate, insentient) and God.
# Between individual souls (jīvātman).
# Between matter and jīvātman.
# Between various types of matter.

The theory of five differences is that &quot;the &quot;jiva&quot; is different from every other entity including all &quot;jivas&quot;&quot;. These five differences are said to explain the nature of the universe. The world is called &quot;prapañca&quot; (&quot;pañca&quot; &quot;five&quot;) by the Dvaita school for this reason.

Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of eternal damnation. According to him, there are three different classes of souls: One class, &quot;Mukti-yogyas&quot;, which would qualify for liberation, another, the &quot;Nitya-samsarins&quot;, which would be subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, &quot;Tamo-yogyas&quot;, which would be condemned to eternal hell (Andhatamisra).

=== &quot;Moksha&quot; (liberation) ===
&quot;Moksha&quot; (liberation) therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme. God is believed to have shown the way to attain &quot;moksha&quot; through several avatars. Bhakti Yoga is an essential part of Dvaita Vedanta. By devotion to God and God&#x27;s grace, &quot;jiva&quot; attains &quot;moksha&quot;. However, bad karma results in condemnation from God.

== Sadhana and Liberation ==
According to Madhvacharya, the &quot;jiva&quot; is unaware of its real nature due to ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;) caused by &quot;maya&quot;, and thus, is unable to realize its expression of intrinsic attributes. Some &quot;jivas&quot; are predestined to attain &quot;moksha&quot;, while others are predestined to eternally suffer.

Liberation for each &quot;jiva&quot; means realizing its innate bliss by removal of covering of &quot;maya&quot;. Liberation can only be achieved by the grace of God with self-effort on the part of the &quot;jiva&quot;. Practicing &quot;vairāgya&quot; allows &quot;Mukti-yogyas&quot; (&quot;jivas&quot; qualified for liberation) to gain freedom from worldly attachments and develop faith in God. Self-effort which makes a &quot;jiva&quot; worthy for liberation involves &quot;karma&quot; (good work), Jnana Yoga (knowledge) and Bhakti Yoga (devotion). S&quot;ādhaka&quot; performs such sadhana through &quot;śravaṇa&quot;, &quot;manana&quot; and &quot;nididhyasana&quot;. Madhva also placed a great importance on a Guru&#x27;s guidance and blessings to understand the jnana from scriptures. According to Madhva, &quot;śravaṇa&quot; and &quot;manana&quot; are the only means for nidhiyasana. This sadhana leads the sadhaka to &quot;aparoksa-jnana&quot; (spiritual realisation) and liberation through grace of God.

== Avidya ==
Dvaita philosophers challenge the Advaita Vedanta view that ignorance explains the appearance of multiplicty in a singular, unchanging reality. Madhva questions the possibility of liberation if both the universe and ignorance are mere illusions connected to Brahman. Madhva further argues that there is no similarity between Brahman and the cosmos to justify such an illusion.

Madhva questions the idea that &quot;avidya&quot; is unique to individual selves, arguing that if individuality itself is a misconception, then avidya must also inherently belong to Brahman. He also criticizes the idea of an unreal feature superimposed on Brahman by Advaitins to explain individual differences, seeing it as circular: if ignorance creates this feature, then ignorance must be part of Brahman, making differences and ignorance real, contradicting the foundational goal of liberation in Advaita philosophy.

== Influence ==
* Dvaita Vedanta and Madhvacharya&#x27;s historical influence in Hinduism, state Kulandran and Kraemer, has been salutary, but not extensive.
* According to Sharma, the influence of Dvaita Vedanta ideas have been most prominent on the Chaitanya school of Bengal Vaishnavism, and in Assam.
* Madhva&#x27;s theology influenced later scholars such as Nimbarka, Vallabha, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. B.N.K. Sharma notes that Nimbarka&#x27;s theology is a loose &quot;réchauffé&quot; of Madhva&#x27;s in its most essential aspects.

<text>Observational equivalence is the property of two or more underlying entities being indistinguishable on the basis of their observable implications. Thus, for example, two scientific theories are observationally equivalent if all of their empirically testable predictions are identical, in which case empirical evidence cannot be used to distinguish which is closer to being correct; indeed, it may be that they are actually two different perspectives on one underlying theory.

In econometrics, two parameter values (or two &quot;structures,&quot; from among a class of statistical models) are considered observationally equivalent if they both result in the same probability distribution of observable data. This term often arises in relation to the identification problem.

In macroeconomics, it happens when you have multiple structural models, with different interpretation, but indistinguishable empirically. &quot;the mapping between structural parameters and the objective function may not display a unique minimum.&quot;

In the formal semantics of programming languages, two terms &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are observationally equivalent if and only if, in all contexts &quot;C&quot;[...] where &quot;C&quot;[&quot;M&quot;] is a valid term, it is the case that &quot;C&quot;[&quot;N&quot;] is also a valid term with the same value. Thus it is not possible, within the system, to distinguish between the two terms. This definition can be made precise only with respect to a particular calculus, one that comes with its own specific definitions of &quot;term&quot;, &quot;context&quot;, and the &quot;value of a term&quot;. The notion is due to James H. Morris, who called it &quot;extensional equivalence.&quot;

<doc id="1064140" wikidata="Q470522" url="?curid=1064140" title="Metro-land">
<text>Metro-land (or Metroland – see note on spelling, below) is a name given to the suburban areas that were built to the north-west of London in the counties of Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Middlesex in the early part of the 20th century that were served by the Metropolitan Railway ((also known as the Met)). The railway company was in the privileged position of being allowed to retain surplus land; from 1919 this was developed for housing by the nominally independent Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE). The term &quot;Metro-land&quot; was coined by the Met&#x27;s marketing department in 1915 when the &quot;Guide to the Extension Line&quot; became the &quot;Metro-land guide&quot;. It promoted a dream of a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London until the Met was absorbed into the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933.

==Metropolitan Railway==
The Metropolitan Railway was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933, its mainline heading north from the capital&#x27;s financial heart in the City to what were to become the Middlesex suburbs. Its first line connected the mainline railway termini at , and King&#x27;s Cross to the City, and when, on 10 January 1863, this line opened with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, it was the world&#x27;s first underground railway. When, in 1871 plans were presented for an underground railway in Paris, it was called the &quot;Métropolitain&quot; in imitation of the line in London. The modern word metro is a short form of the French word. The railway was soon extended from both ends and northwards via a branch from Baker Street. It reached Hammersmith in 1864, Richmond in 1877 and completed the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; in 1884, but the most important route became the line north into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached in 1880, and the line eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London. From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the Great Central Railway route out of .

Electric traction was introduced in 1905 with electric multiple units operating services between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the Metropolitan Railway purchased electric locomotives, and these were exchanged for steam locomotives on trains at Harrow from 1908. To improve services, more powerful electric and steam locomotives were purchased in the 1920s. A short branch opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925. The long Stanmore branch from Wembley Park was completed in 1932.

===Metro-land===

Unlike other railway companies, which were required to dispose of surplus land, the Met was in a privileged position with clauses in its acts allowing it to retain land that it believed was necessary for future railway use. Initially the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee, made up of Met directors. In the 1880s, at the same time as the railway was extending beyond Swiss Cottage and building the workers&#x27; estate at Neasden, roads and sewers were built at Willesden Park Estate, and the land was sold to builders. Similar developments followed at Cecil Park, near Pinner and, after the failure of the tower at Wembley, plots were sold at Wembley Park.

Robert Selbie, then General Manager, thought in 1912 that some professionalism was needed and suggested a company be formed to take over from the Surplus Lands Committee to develop estates near the railway. The First World War delayed these plans however, and it was 1919, with the expectation of a housing boom, before the MRCE was formed. Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the unique position the Met held, the railway company sought legal advice. The legal opinion was that although the Met had authority to hold land, it had none to develop it, so an independent company was created, although all but one of its directors were also directors of the railway company. The MRCE went on to develop estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth and create places such as Harrow Garden Village.

The term Metro-land was coined by the Met&#x27;s marketing department in 1915 when the &quot;Guide to the Extension Line&quot; became the &quot;Metro-land&quot; guide, priced at 1d. This promoted the land served by the Met for the walker, the visitor and later the house-hunter. Published annually until 1932, the last full year of independence for the Met, the guide extolled the benefits of &quot;The good air of the Chilterns,&quot; using language such as &quot;Each lover of Metroland may well have his own favourite wood beech and coppice – all tremulous green loveliness in Spring and russet and gold in October.&quot; The dream promoted was of a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London.

From about 1914 the company had promoted itself as The Met, but after 1920 the commercial manager, John Wardle, ensured that timetables and other publicity material used the term Metro instead. Land development also occurred in central London when in 1929 a large, luxurious block of apartments called Chiltern Court opened at Baker Street, designed by the Met&#x27;s architect Charles W. Clark, who was also responsible for the design of a number of station reconstructions in outer &quot;Metro-land&quot; at this time.

A few large houses had been built on parts of Wembley Park, south-west of the Metropolitan station, as early as the 1890s. In 1906, when Watkin’s Tower closed, the Tower Company had become the Wembley Park Estate Company (later Wembley Ltd.), with the aim of developing Wembley as a residential suburb.

Unlike other railways, from an early date the Metropolitan Railway had bought land alongside its line and then developed housing on it. In the 1880s and 1890s it had done so with the Willesden Park Estate near Willesden Green station, and in the early 1900s it developed on land in Pinner, as well as planning the expansion of Wembley Park.

In 1915 by the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s publicity department had created the term Metro-land. It was used as the new name for the company&#x27;s annual guide to the places it served (known as Guide to the Extension Line prior to 1915). The &quot;Metro-land&quot; guide, although partly written to attract walkers and day trippers, was clearly primarily intended to encourage the building of suburban homes and create middle-class commuters who would use the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s trains for all their needs. It was published annually until 1932, but when the Metropolitan became part of London Transport in 1933 the term and guide were abandoned. By then North-West London was well on the road to its reputation for suburbanisation.

The 1924 &quot;Metro-land&quot; guide describes Wembley Park as &quot;rapidly developed of recent years as a residential district&quot;, pointing out that there are several golf courses within a few minutes journey of it.

Over the years during which the guide was published, large numbers of Londoners moved out to the new estates in north-west London. Some of these estates were developed by MRCE, a company that Robert H. Selbie, the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s General Manager, set up in 1919. It would eventually build houses along the line, from Neasden reaching far out as Amersham.

One of the earliest of these MRCE developments was a 123-acre one at Chalkhill, within the bounds of what was Repton’s Wembley Park. MRCE acquired the land shortly after it was created and began selling plots in 1921. The railway even put in a siding to bring building materials to the estate.

The term ‘Metroland’ (often seen now without the hyphen - see Note on spelling, below) has become shorthand for the suburban areas that were built in north-west London and in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Middlesex following the Metropolitan branches. It had become immortalised well before the guide stopped being published. A song called &quot;My Little Metro-land Home&quot; had been published in 1920, and Evelyn Waugh’s novel &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; (1928) has a character marrying a Viscount Metroland. She reappears, with the title Lady Metroland, in two more of Waugh&#x27;s novels; &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; (1930) and &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1934).

The British Empire Exhibition further encouraged the new phenomenon of suburban development. Wembley&#x27;s sewerage was improved, many roads in the area were straightened and widened and new bus services began operating. Visitors were steadily introduced to Wembley and some later moved to the area when houses had been built to accommodate them.

Between 1921 and 1928 season ticket sales at Wembley Park and neighbouring Metropolitan stations rose by over 700%. Like the rest of West London, most of Wembley Park and its environs was fully developed, largely with relatively low-density suburban housing, by 1939.

===Absorption of the Met===
On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), and the railway became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The LPTB was not interested in running goods and freight services and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) took over all freight traffic. At the same time the LNER became responsible for hauling passenger trains with steam locomotives north of Rickmansworth. The lines north of Aylesbury to Verney Junction and Brill were closed; last train to Brill ran on 30 November 1935 and to Quainton Road and Verney Junction on 2 April 1936. Quainton Road continued to be served by the LNER. For a time, the LPTB used the &quot;Metro-land&quot; tag: &quot;Cheap fares to Metro-land and the sea&quot; were advertised in 1934 but the &quot;Metro-land&quot; brand was rapidly dropped. London Transport introduced new slogans such as &quot;Away by Metropolitan&quot; and &quot;Good spot, the Chilterns&quot;.

Steam traction continued to be used on the outer sections of what had become the &quot;Metropolitan line&quot; until 1961. From that date Metropolitan trains ran only as far as Amersham, with main line services from Marylebone covering stations between Great Missenden and Aylesbury.

==Defining Metro-land==

The term Metro-land is applied to suburban areas around the route of the Metropolitan Railway, areas which urbanised under the influence of the railway in the 20th century. It applies to land in Middlesex, west Hertfordshire and south Buckinghamshire. The Middlesex area is now administered as the London Boroughs of Brent and Harrow, together with part of the London Borough of Hillingdon.

The architect Hugh Casson regarded Harrow as the &quot;capital city&quot; of Metro-land, while Arthur Mee&#x27;s &quot;King&#x27;s England&quot; described Wembley as its &quot;epitome&quot;.

The &quot;Metro-land&quot; guide insisted that Metro-land was &quot;a country with elastic borders that each visitor can draw for himself&quot;. Even so, &quot;Metro-land&quot; was quite firm that, so far as the Buckinghamshire Chilterns were concerned, its &quot;Grand Duchy&quot; was confined to the hundred of Burnham: &quot;the Chilterns round Marlow and the Wycombes are not in Metro-land&quot;.

The usefulness of the term &quot;Metro-land&quot;, has occasionally led journalists to use the term for the suburban catchment of other underground lines.

==Slogans and references==
The Metropolitan&#x27;s terminus at Baker Street was &quot;the gateway to Metro-land&quot; and Chiltern Court, which opened over the station in 1929 and was headquarters during the Second World War of the Special Operations Executive, was &quot;&quot;at&quot; the gateway to Metro-land&quot;. In similar vein, Chorleywood and Chenies, later described by John Betjeman as &quot;the essential Metro-land&quot;, were &quot;at the gateway&quot; of the Chiltern Hills (of which Wendover was the &quot;pearl&quot;).

===Literature and songs===

Before the end of the First World War George R. Sims had incorporated the term in verse: &quot;I know a land where the wild flowers grow/Near, near at hand if by train you go,/Metroland, Metroland&quot;.

By the 1920s, the word was so ingrained in the consciousness that, in Evelyn Waugh’s novel, &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; (1928), the Hon Margot Beste-Chetwynde took Viscount Metroland as her second husband. Lady Metroland&#x27;s second appearance in &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; in 1930 and &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; in 1934 further reinforces this.

Metro-land further entered the public psyche with the song &quot;My Little Metro-land Home&quot; (lyrics by Boyle Lawrence and music by Henry Thraile, 1920), while another ditty extolled the virtues of the Poplars estate at Ruislip with the assertion that &quot;It&#x27;s a very short distance by rail on the Met/And at the gate you&#x27;ll find waiting, sweet Violet&quot;.

Queensbury and its local surroundings and characters were cited in the song &quot;Queensbury Station&quot; by the Berlin-based punk-jazz band The Magoo Brothers on their album &quot;Beyond Believable&quot;, released on the Bouncing Corporation label in 1988. The song was written by Paul Bonin and Melanie Hickford, who both grew up and lived in the area.

In 1997, &quot;Metroland&quot; was the title and setting for a movie starring Christian Bale about the development of the relationship between a husband and wife living in the area. The movie was based on the novel of the same name written by Julian Barnes.

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark recorded a song &quot;Metroland&quot; on the English Electric album. It was released as a single, with the video showing the singer dreamily gazing out from a train at an idealised suburban landscape.

===&quot;Live in Metro-land&quot;===
In 1903 the Metropolitan developed a housing estate at Cecil Park, Pinner, the first of many such enterprises over the next thirty years. Overseen by the Metropolitan&#x27;s general manager from 1908 to 1930, Robert H Selbie, the railway formed its own Country Estates Company in 1919. The slogan, &quot;Live in Metro-land&quot;, was even etched on the door handles of Metropolitan carriages.

Some stations, such as Hillingdon (1923), were built specifically to serve the company&#x27;s suburban developments. A number, including Wembley Park, Croxley Green (1925) and Stanmore (1932), were designed by Charles W. Clark (who was responsible also for Chiltern Court) in an Arts and crafts &quot;villa&quot; style. These were intended to blend with their surroundings, though, in retrospect, they arguably lacked the panache and vision of Charles Holden&#x27;s striking, modern designs for the Underground group in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

===Imitators===
Nearly 70 years later the Chilterns Conservation Board was advertising &quot;Chilterns Country – countryside walks from rail stations&quot; (2004). Drawing no doubt on &quot;Metro-land, a guide for ramblers&quot;, published by British Railways Southern Region shortly after the Second World War, it referred to the &quot;Rambleland&quot; stations of Surrey and Sussex.

==Spirit of Metro-land==
The sentimental and somewhat archaic prose of the &quot;Metro-land&quot; guide (&quot;the Roman road aslant the eastern border ... the innumerable field-paths which mark the labourer&#x27;s daily route from hamlet to farm&quot;) conjured up a rustic Eden – a Middle England, perhaps – similar to that invoked by Stanley Baldwin (Prime Minister three times between 1923 and 1937) who, though of manufacturing stock, famously donned the mantle of countryman (&quot;the tinkle of the hammer on the anvil in the country smithy, the sound of the scythe against the whetstone&quot;). As one historian of the London Underground put it wryly, &quot;the world of Metroland is not cluttered with people: its suburban streets are empty ... There are, it seems, more farm animals than people.&quot;

A more cynical view, that sought to contrast illusion with changing times, was offered in 1934 by the composer and conductor Constant Lambert who &quot;conjure[d] up the hideous faux bonhomie of the hiker, noisily wading his way through the petrol pumps of Metroland, singing obsolete sea chanties &quot;[sic]&quot; with the aid of the Week-End Book, imbibing chemically flavoured synthetic beer under the impression that he is tossing off a tankard of &#x27;jolly good ale and old&#x27; ... and astonishing the local garage proprietor by slapping him on the back and offering him a pint of &#x27;four &#x27;alf&#x27;&quot;. 

===Town &quot;v.&quot; country===
With similar ambiguity, &quot;Metro-land&quot; combined idyllic photographs of rural tranquillity with advertising spreads for new, though leafy, housing developments. Herein lay the contradictions well captured by Leslie Thomas in his novel, &quot;The Tropic of Ruislip&quot; (1974): &quot;in the country but not of it. The fields seemed touchable and yet remote&quot;. Writer and historian A. N. Wilson reflected how suburban developments of the early 20th century that had been brought within easy reach of London by the railways, &quot;merely ended up creating an endless ribbon ... not perhaps either town or country&quot;. In the process, despite &quot;Metro-land&quot;&#x27;s promotion of rusticity, a number of outlying towns and villages were &quot;swallowed up and lost their identity&quot;.

====Influence of &quot;Country Life&quot;====
Wilson noted that the magazine &quot;Country Life&quot;, which had been founded by Edward Hudson as &quot;Country Life Illustrated&quot; in 1897, had influenced this pattern with its advertisements for country houses: &quot;If you were a stockbroker or a lawyer&#x27;s wife ... you could perhaps afford a new Tudorbethan mansion, with an oak staircase and mullioned windows and half-timbered gables, in Godalming or Esher, or Amersham or Penn&quot;. Of the surrounding landscape, &quot;Country Life&quot; itself has observed that, in its early days, it offered
====Growth of Metro-land====
By the 1930s the availability of mortgages with an average rate of interest of 4 per cent meant that private housing was well within the range of most middle class and many working-class pockets. This was a potent factor in the growth of Metro-land: for example, in the first three decades of the 20th century the population of Harrow Weald rose from 1,500 to 11,000 and that of Pinner from 3,000 to 23,000. In 1932 Northwick Park was said to have grown over the previous five years at the rate of 1,000 houses annually and Rayners Lane to &quot;repay a visit at short intervals to see it grow&quot;.

===Sir John Betjeman===
In the mid-20th century the spirit of Metro-land was evoked in three &quot;late chrysanthemums&quot; by Sir John Betjeman (1906–1984), Poet Laureate from 1972 until his death: &quot;Harrow-on-the-Hill&quot; (&quot;When melancholy autumn comes to Wembley / And electric trains are lighted after tea&quot;), &quot;Middlesex&quot; (&quot;Gaily into Ruislip Gardens / Runs the red electric train&quot;) and &quot;The Metropolitan Railway&quot; (&quot;Early Electric! With what radiant hope / Men formed this many-branched electrolier&quot;). In his autobiographical &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot; (1960) Betjeman recalled that &quot;Metroland / Beckoned us out to lanes in beechy Bucks&quot;.

Described much later by &quot;The Times&quot; as the &quot;hymnologist of Metroland&quot;, Betjeman reached a wider audience with his celebrated documentary for BBC Television, &quot;Metro-land&quot;, directed by Edward Mirzoeff, which was first broadcast on 26 February 1973 and was released as a DVD 33 years later. The critic Clive James, who judged the programme &quot;an instant classic&quot;, observed that &quot;it saw how the district had been destroyed by its own success&quot;.

To mark the centenary of Betjeman&#x27;s birth his daughter Candida Lycett Green (born 1942) spearheaded a series of celebratory railway events, including an excursion on 2 September 2006 from Marylebone to Quainton Road, now home of the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. Lycett Green noted of the planning of this trip that among the fine details considered were which filling to have in the baguettes on the train through Metro-land and how long it would stop on the track so that the poem &quot;Middlesex&quot; could be read over the tannoy. The event was in the tradition of earlier commemorations of &quot;Metro-land&quot;, such as a centenary parade of rolling stock at Neasden in 1963 and celebrations in 2004 to mark the centenary of the Uxbridge branch.

===&quot;Avenger&quot;land===
Metro-land (notably west Hertfordshire) formed the backdrop for the 1960s ABC TV series &quot;The Avengers&quot;, whose popular imagery was deployed with a twist of fantasy. The archetypal Metro-land subjects (such as the railway station and the quiet suburb) became the settings for fiendish plots and treachery in this series and others, such as &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;The Baron&quot; and &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, all of which made regular use of locations within easy reach of film studios at Borehamwood and Pinewood.

==Escaping Metro-land==
Some abhorred Metro-land for its predictability and sameness. A. N. Wilson observed that, although semi-detached dwellings of the kind built in the inner Metro-land suburbs in the 1930s &quot;aped larger houses, the stockbroker Tudorbethan of Edwardian Surrey and Middlesex&quot;, they were in fact &quot;pokey&quot;. He reflected that
===Post-war attitudes===
By the end of the Second World War architects in general were turning their backs on suburbia; the very word tended to be used pejoratively, even contemptuously. In 1951 Michael Young, one of the architects of the Labour Party&#x27;s electoral victory in 1945, observed that &quot;one suburb is much like another in an atomised society. Rarely does community flourish&quot;, while the American Lewis Mumford, wrote in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; in 1953 that &quot;monotony and suburbanism&quot; were the result of the &quot;unimaginative&quot; design of Britain&#x27;s post-war New Towns. When the editor of the &quot;Architectural Review&quot;, J. M. Richards, wrote in &quot;The Castles on the Ground&quot; (1946) that &quot;for all the alleged deficiencies of suburban taste ... it holds for ninety out of a hundred Englishmen an appeal which cannot be explained away as some strange instance of mass aberration&quot;, he was, in his own words, &quot;scorned by my contemporaries as either an irrelevant eccentricity or a betrayal of the forward looking views of the Modern Movement&quot;.

John Betjeman admired John Piper&#x27;s illustrations for &quot;Castles on the Ground&quot;, describing the &quot;fake half-timber, the leaded lights and bow windows of the Englishman&#x27;s castle&quot; as &quot;the beauty of the despised, patronised suburb&quot;. However, as the historian David Kynaston observed sixty years later, &quot;the time was far from ripe for Metroland nostalgia&quot;.

===Julian Barnes: &quot;Metroland&quot;===
Valerie Grove, who conceded that Metro-land was &quot;a kinder word than &#x27;suburbia&#x27;&quot; and referred to the less spoilt areas beyond Rickmansworth as &quot;Outer Metro-land&quot;, maintained that &quot;suburbia had no visible history. Anyone with any spirit ... had to get out of Metro-land to make their mark&quot;.

Thus, the central character of &quot;Metroland&quot; (1980), a novel by Julian Barnes (born 1946) that was filmed in 1997, ended up in Paris during the disturbances of May 1968 – though, by the late 1970s, having thrown off the yearnings of his youth, he was back in Metro-land. &quot;Metroland&quot; recounted the essence of suburbia in the early 1960s and the features of daily travel by a schoolboy, Christopher Lloyd, on the Metropolitan line to and from London. During a French lesson, Christopher declared, &quot;J’habite Metroland&quot; [&quot;I live in Metroland&quot;], because it &quot;sounds better than Eastwick [the fictional location of his home], stranger than Middlesex&quot;.

In real life, some schoolboys had made similar journeys for more hedonistic reasons. Betjeman recalled that, between the wars, boys from Harrow School had used the Metropolitan for illicit excursions to night clubs in London: &quot;Whenever the police raided the Hypocrites&#x27; Club or the Coconut Club, the &#x27;43 or the Blue Lantern there would always be Harrovians there&quot;.

===Social mobility: &quot;Tropic of Ruislip&quot;===
Between Metro-land&#x27;s heyday before the Second World War and the end of the 20th century, the proportion of owner-occupied dwellings in England, already rising fast from the mid-1920s, doubled from a third to two-thirds. In &quot;Tropic of Ruislip&quot;, Leslie Thomas’s humorous account of suburban sexual and social mores in the mid-1970s (adapted for television as &quot;Tropic&quot;, ATV 1979), the steady flow of families from council housing on one side of the railway to an executive estate on the other side served to illustrate what was becoming known as &quot;upward mobility&quot;. Another sign was that, by the end of the book, &quot;half the neighbourhood&quot; of Plummers Park (probably based on Carpenders Park, on the outskirts of Watford) had moved south of the River Thames to Wimbledon or nearby Southfields. This was put down to the &quot;attractions of Victoriana&quot;, which, like suburbia itself, championed at the time by Betjeman&#x27;s &quot;Metro-land&quot;, was coming back into fashion; however, it appeared to have just as much to do with couples following each other round in order to maintain extramarital affairs.

Another glimpse of Metro-land in the 1970s was provided by &quot;The Good Life&quot;, the BBC TV comedy series (1975-8) about suburban self sufficiency. Though set in Surbiton, the programme&#x27;s location filming was carried out in Northwood, an area reached by the Metropolitan in 1885. A less benign view of Metro-land was offered in the mid noughties by the detective series, &quot;Murder in Suburbia&quot; (ITV 2004-6), which, though set in the fictional town of Middleford, was also filmed in Northwood and other parts of North West London.

==Note on spelling==
The form &quot;Metroland&quot; is now in common use, but the &quot;brand&quot; was hyphenated as &quot;Metro-land&quot; or &quot;METRO-LAND&quot;, as that was the form always employed by the Metropolitan Railway in its brochures and on the trains themselves. Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman (in &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot;) and Julian Barnes all dispensed with the hyphen, though Betjeman&#x27;s documentary of 1973 used &quot;Metro-land&quot;.

<text>Paterson railway station is located on the North Coast line in New South Wales, Australia. It serves the town of Paterson. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Hunter line services travelling between Newcastle and Dungog. The station opened on 14 August 1911, and its original wooden station building is still in place.

==Platforms and services==
Paterson station consists of a single platform. It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Hunter line services travelling between Newcastle and Dungog. There are five services in each direction on weekdays, with three on weekends and public holidays.

Opposite the platform is a 1,820 metre crossing loop. In the mid-1980s, the Rail Motor Society established its base on the site of the former freight yard opposite the station.

<text>Inmos International plc (trademark INMOS) and two operating subsidiaries, Inmos Limited (UK) and Inmos Corporation (US), was a British semiconductor company founded by Iann Barron, Richard Petritz, and Paul Schroeder in July 1978. Inmos Limited’s head office and design office were at Aztec West business park in Bristol, England.

==Products==

Inmos&#x27; first products were static RAM devices, followed by dynamic RAMs and EEPROMs. Despite early production difficulties, Inmos eventually captured around 60% of the world SRAM market. However, Barron&#x27;s long-term aim was to produce an innovative microprocessor architecture intended for parallel processing, the &quot;transputer&quot;. David May and Robert Milne were recruited to design this processor, which went into production in 1985 in the form of the T212 and T414 chips.

The transputer achieved some success as the basis for several parallel supercomputers from companies such as Meiko (formed by ex-Inmos employees in 1985), Floating Point Systems, Parsytec and Parsys. It was used in a few workstations, the most notable probably being the Atari Transputer Workstation. Being a relatively self-contained design, it was also used in some embedded systems. However, the unconventional nature of the transputer and its native occam programming language limited its appeal. During the late 1980s, the transputer (even in its later T800 form) also struggled to keep up with the ever-increasing performance of its competitors.

Other devices produced by Inmos included the A100, A110 and A121 digital signal processors, G364 framebuffer, and a line of video RAMDACs, including the G170 and G171, which was adopted by IBM for the original VGA graphics adapter used in the IBM PS/2.

==Business history==
The company was founded by Iann Barron, a British computer consultant, Richard Petritz and Paul Schroeder, both American semiconductor industry veterans. Initial funding of £50 million was provided by the UK government via the National Enterprise Board. A US subsidiary, Inmos Corporation, was also established in Colorado. Semiconductor fabrication facilities were built in the US at Colorado Springs, Colorado and in the UK at Newport, South Wales.

Under the privatization policy of Margaret Thatcher the National Enterprise Board was merged into the British Technology Group and had to sell its shares in Inmos. Offers for Inmos from AT&amp;T and a Dutch consortium had been turned down. In 1982, construction of the microprocessor factory in Newport, South Wales was completed. By July 1984 Thorn EMI had made a £124.1m bid for the state&#x27;s 76% interest in the company (the remaining 24% had been held by Inmos founders and employees). Later it was raised to £192 million, approved August 1984 and finalized in September.

In total, Inmos had received £211 million from the government, but did not become profitable.
According to Iann Barron Inmos &quot;was&quot; profitable in 1984 &quot;we were really profitable in 1984 ... we made revenues of £150 million, and we made a profit which was slightly less than £10 million&quot;.

In April 1989, Inmos was sold to SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics). Around the same time, work was started on an enhanced transputer, the T9000. This encountered various technical problems and delays, and was eventually abandoned, signalling the end of the development of the transputer as a parallel processing platform. However, transputer derivatives such as the ST20 were later incorporated into chipsets for embedded applications such as set-top boxes.

In December 1994, Inmos was fully assimilated into STMicroelectronics, and the usage of the Inmos brand name was discontinued.

<doc id="1064149" wikidata="Q1300778" url="?curid=1064149" title="Violin Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)">
<text>The Violin Sonata No. 8 in G major, Op. 30, No. 3, by Ludwig van Beethoven, the third of his Opus 30 set, was written between 1801 and 1802, published in May 1803, and dedicated to Tsar Alexander I of Russia. 

==Structure==
The sonata has three movements:

# &quot;Allegro assai&quot;
# &quot;Tempo di minuetto, ma molto moderato e grazioso&quot; – in E-flat major
# &quot;Allegro vivace&quot;

This sonata is characteristic of early/middle Beethoven in its solid sonata structure, just beginning to get adventurous in syncopation, with some extraordinary off beat sforzandi.

The work takes approximately 18 minutes to perform.

==Notable recordings==

Famous recordings of the sonata include one by Fritz Kreisler with Sergei Rachmaninoff at the piano.

<doc id="1064150" wikidata="Q6971923" url="?curid=1064150" title="National Council of Negro Women">
<text>The National Council of Negro Women, Inc. (NCNW) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1935 with the mission to advance the opportunities and the quality of life for African-American women, their families, and communities. Mary McLeod Bethune, the founder of NCNW, wanted to encourage the participation of Negro women in civic, political, economic and educational activities and institutions. The organization was considered as a clearing house for the dissemination of activities concerning women but wanted to work alongside a group that supported civil rights rather than go to actual protests. Women on the council fought more towards political and economic successes of black women to uplift them in society. NCNW fulfills this mission through research, advocacy, national and community-based services, and programs in the United States and Africa.

NCNW serves as a super organization that acts as a cohesive umbrella for the other African-American groups that already existed. With its 37 national affiliate organizations and its more than 200 community-based sections, NCNW has an outreach to nearly four million women, all contributing to the peaceful solutions of the problems of human welfare and rights. The national headquarters, which acts as a central source for program planning, is based in Washington, D.C., on Pennsylvania Avenue, located between the White House and the U.S. Capitol. NCNW also has two field offices.

== Social contributions ==
The NCNW also produced several cookbooks. Their first one, &quot;The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro,&quot; was published in 1958, edited by Sue Bailey Thurman. It took more than a decade to produce and fundraise for and includes research and contributions from African-American women across the country. The goal of the cookbook was in line with the goals of the NCNW, which include furthering world peace, further integration, and also hold on to and value African-American heritage as a unique cultural form. This cookbook is not organized by the genre of the food, but by the calendar year, starting with “Hopping John” for Emancipation Proclamation Day and ending with “Hot Apple Punch” for Christmas.

One of its goals was also to include recognition and appreciation for African-American heroes and heroines throughout history, such as George Washington Carver, for example, who gets one of his own recipes in the cookbook for &quot;Carver Commemoration Day.&quot; Moreover, the cookbook aimed to insert African-American accomplishments into the mainstream idea of history in the U.S. that consists largely of the recorded the accomplishments of white men. In &quot;The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro,&quot; Sue Bailey Thurman set out to show how history resides in the social and cultural products of heritage recipes.

The NCNW did not produce another cookbook for more than thirty years, until the 1990s, when it came out with &quot;The Black Family Reunion Cookbook: Recipes and Food Memories&quot; (1991), &quot;The Black Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook: Health Conscious Recipes and Food Memories&quot; (1993), and &quot;Celebrating Our Mothers&#x27; Kitchens: Treasured Memories and Tested Recipes&quot; (1994). These three cookbooks were much more dedicated to food itself than &quot;The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro&quot;, but still included oral histories, personal narratives, political commentary, popular culture, and food and food customs, all intertwined with culinary instruction. The recipes are from both old family recipes from African-American women around the country, as well as documented historical recipes. Many recipes in these newer cookbooks start with an opening vignette about a loved family member or a story that ties the food to a special event or place.

These cookbooks also intended to emphasize the potency of food, happy memories with family, and the image of well-fed children in order to contribute to a positive African-American collective memory and to resist negative stereotypes about African-American women that have circulated in the U.S. since the times of slavery. The NCNW cookbooks work to form a cohesive African-American identity surrounding food.

== Political standpoint ==
Although Bethune and the NCNW were very much involved in the struggle over the Equal Rights Amendment, especially in the late 1940s, even she was careful to keep her organization on the conservative side of the issue and refused to support the amendment. In 1965 the NCNW recruited many northern women with professional backgrounds in such fields as psychology, social work, and education as well as unskilled volunteers to aid the Freedom Schools, and other developing programs under the Office of Economic Opportunity which the NCNW had held to establish in Mississippi.

== Mary McLeod Bethune ==
From 1936 to 1942, Bethune was simultaneously the president of Bethune-Cookman College (founded by her in 1904, for black students in Daytona, Florida), the first president and founder of the NCNW and the special Roosevelt as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. Her plans were to plan, initiate, and carry out the dreams of African-American women who felt unheard and mistreated.

== Other founders ==
When Bethune stepped down from the presidency of the NCNW, in November 1949 at the age of 74, her two successors, Dorothy B. Ferebee, who presided from 1949 to 1953, and Vivian C. Mason, who presided from 1953 to 1957, carried on the tradition of &quot;black first&quot;. After 1958, under Dorothy Height&#x27;s leadership, the NCNW began to move in new directions to come to terms with a number of old problems, and she works to bring the organization up to date with the times. In her first years as president, Height concentrated on achieving concrete goals: the acquisition of tax-exempt status; the erection of the Bethune Memorial Statue; the professionalization of the NCNW; and the establishment of Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Museum and National Archives for Black Women&#x27;s History.

== Dorothy Height ==
Dorothy Height served as the NCNW&#x27;s fourth president from 1957 to 1997, helping women feel empowered until the day she died. She marched with Martin Luther King at the civil rights marches and was invited to President Obama&#x27;s inauguration. President Obama also spoke at her funeral along with many other women and men who cared deeply for her. One of Height&#x27;s main concerns was with the problems many blacks faced as a result of their poverty. So, she began a campaign in Mississippi that would make better food and shelter available for those at a disadvantage by partnering with the federal government to support Black women with getting houses built for their families. The main project of this campaign was to establish a &quot;pig bank&quot; which would lend pigs to black families and charge interest equal to one pig per family. By 1957 the original &quot;pig banks,&quot; of what was 55 had grown to more than 2,000 pigs. Thus, the NCNW aided many poor families in the rural South by helping them to make many practical improvements in their daily lives. This program helped many families out of poverty giving them free meals to live off of.

== Archives project ==
Mary McLeod Bethune, the founder, worked to get African-American women their own institution that contained records and history of other black women to support the uplift of women&#x27;s empowerment. She used the NCNW to help create the National Archives of Negro Women&#x27;s History by establishing a committee specifically to find information about different African-American women so they could feel just as educated.

==National and international programs==
Some of NCNW&#x27;s recent programs include:
* The annual Black Family Reunion Program Celebration
* Public education and advocacy for African Americans on Supreme Court and lower court nominees
* Early childhood literacy programs to close the achievement gap
* A new initiative and publication entitled &quot;African American Women As We Age&quot;, which is intended to educate women on health and finances
* A national obesity abatement initiative
* A partnership with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop Community Learning Centers targeting traditionally underserved students
* Technical assistance to eight Youth Opportunity Centers in Washington, DC

Some of NCNW&#x27;s recent international activities include:
* Maintaining consultative status at the United Nations to represent the voice of African-American women
* Partnering with national women&#x27;s organizations in Benin to deliver technology, literacy, microcredit and economic empowerment programs
* Linking youth in Uganda, north Africa and the U.S. in a three-nation educational exchange.
Developing a small business incubator in Senegal
* Partnering in the implementation of a large microcredit program in Eritrea extending small business loans and training to more than 500 women.

Serving as an umbrella organization for 39 national and local advocacy groups for women of African descent both in the U.S. and abroad, the National Council of Negro Women coordinates its activities with partners in 34 states. The council also runs four research and policy centers in its efforts to develop best practices in addressing the health, educational, and economic needs of African-American women. In 2007, NCNW&#x27;s administrative costs were an estimated $4 million of the organization&#x27;s group&#x27;s $6 million budget for programs.

==National Black Family Reunion==
NCNW organizes the National Black Family Reunion, a two-day cultural event celebrating the enduring strengths and traditional values of the African-American fathers.

<text>Metroland was an alternative newspaper that was published weekly in Albany, New York and mainly served the Capital District area. Distributed free of charge, the paper offered local arts and music scene coverage, news and feature articles, and political columns with a mostly liberal bent. It billed itself as &quot;The Capital Region&#x27;s Alternative Newsweekly&quot;.

Every week, &quot;Metroland&quot; included an opinion column, several local news stories, a cover story, and a comprehensive calendar of events (with a movie clock). In addition, it had published reviews of movies, restaurants, concerts, recordings, art exhibitions, dance performances, and plays. &quot;Metroland&quot; columnists include Paul Rapp, Miriam Axel-Lute, and Jo Page. Regular syndicated features include This Modern World, Savage Love, Partially Clips, Slowpoke, and Free Will Astrology. The paper also published special features such as &quot;Best of the Capital Region&quot;, Readers Poll, fashion issues, dining guides, and &quot;Inside Saratoga&quot;.

&quot;Metroland&quot; was edited and published by Stephen Leon and was founded in 1978 by Peter Iselin. The newspaper was published by Lou Communications, Inc. and is a member of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies.

On November 3, 2015, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance seized its 279 Washington Avenue offices for unpaid back taxes of over $20,000. Since then, &quot;Metroland&quot; has ceased publication.

<text>Gaudiya Vaishnavism (), also known as Chaitanya Vaishnavism, is a Vaishnava Hindu religious movement inspired by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534) in India. &quot;Gaudiya&quot; refers to the Gaura or Gauḍa region of Bengal (present-day Malda district of West Bengal and Rajshahi district of Bangladesh), with Vaishnavism meaning &quot;the worship of Vishnu&quot;. Specifically, it is part of Krishnaism–Krishna-centric Vaishnavite traditions.

Its theological basis is primarily that of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (known within the tradition as the &quot;Srimad Bhagavatam&quot;), as interpreted by early followers of Chaitanya, such as Sanatana Goswami, Rupa Goswami, Jiva Goswami, Gopala Bhatta Goswami and others.

The focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (known as bhakti yoga) of Radha and Krishna, and their many divine incarnations as the supreme forms of God, &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot;. Most popularly, this worship takes the form of singing Radha and Krishna&#x27;s holy names, such as &quot;Hare&quot;, &quot;Krishna&quot; and &quot;Rama&quot;, most commonly in the form of the Hare Krishna (mantra), also known as kirtan and dancing along with it.

Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the spiritual and philosophical foundation of the well-known International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the &quot;Hare Krishna Movement&quot;.

==Philosophical concepts==
===Living beings===
According to Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, consciousness is not a product of matter, but is instead a manifestation of the soul. All living beings (jivas), including animals and trees, have a soul. That soul is distinct from their current physical body – the nature of the soul being eternal, immutable, and indestructible without any particular birth or death. The soul does not die when the body dies, but it is transmigrated into another new body and takes new birth in a new body. Souls which are captivated by the illusory nature of the world (&quot;Maya&quot;) are repeatedly reborn among 8.4 million species of life on this planet and in other worlds in accordance to the laws of karma and individual desire. This is consistent with the concept of &quot;samsara&quot; found in Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist beliefs.

Release from the process of &quot;samsara&quot; (known as &quot;moksha&quot;) is believed to be achievable through a variety of spiritual practices, and in general, is the ultimate aim in life. However, within Gaudiya Vaishnavism, it is &quot;bhakti&quot; in its purest state (or &quot;pure love of God&quot;) which is given as the ultimate aim, rather than liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition asserts that in the current yuga, which is Kali Yuga, singing and chanting the various sacred names of God (Krishna) are sufficient for spiritual liberation.

===Supreme Person (God)===

One of the defining aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is that Krishna is worshiped specifically as the source of all &quot;avataric&quot; incarnations of God. Theologians refer to verse 1.3.28 of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, &quot;krsnastu bhagavan svayam&quot;, literally &quot;Krishna is God Himself&quot; to point to Krishna as the Supreme Being. Jiva Gosvami calls this phrase the &quot;paribhasha-sutra&quot; (definitive rule) of the theology of the Gaudiya Vaishnava school and a &quot;mahavakya&quot; (governing proposition).

===Inconceivable oneness and difference===

A particularly distinct part of the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy espoused by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is the concept of &quot;Achintya Bheda Abheda&quot;, which translates to &quot;inconceivable oneness and difference&quot; in the context of the soul&#x27;s relationship with Krishna, and also Krishna&#x27;s relationship with his other energies (i.e. the material world).

In &quot;quality&quot;, the soul (&quot;jiva&quot;) is described as being identical to God, but in terms of &quot;quantity,&quot; individual &quot;jivas&quot; are said to be infinitesimal in comparison to the unlimited Supreme Being. The exact nature of this relationship (being simultaneously one and different with Krishna) is inconceivable to the human mind but can be experienced through the process of Bhakti yoga.

This philosophy serves as a meeting of two opposing schools of Hindu philosophy, pure monism (God and the soul as one entity) and pure dualism (God and the soul as absolutely separate). This philosophy largely recapitulates the concepts of qualified nondualism practiced by the older Vedantic school Vishishtadvaita, but emphasizes the figure of Krishna over Narayana and holy sites in and around Vrindavan and Bengal over sites in Tamil Nadu. In practice, Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy has much more in common with the dualistic schools especially closely following theological traditions established by Madhvacharya&#x27;s Dvaita Vedanta.

=== Sat Sandarbhas ===
Jiva Goswami wrote &quot;Sat Sandarbhas&quot; as an analysis of the &quot;Bhagvata Purana&quot; to elaborate on the philosophy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The six treatises are:

* &quot;Tattva&quot;: defines the absolute reality, dealing with epistemology and ontology. Establishes the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; as the supreme &quot;pramana&quot;
* &quot;Bhagavat&quot;: elaborates on the nature of &quot;Bhagavan&quot;, the complete manifestation amongst the three aspects of absolute reality mentioned in &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; 1.2.11. Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan are three aspects of the Absolute Reality as perceived by different types of spiritual aspirants.
* &quot;Paramatma&quot;: describes Paramatma as a partial manifestation of &quot;Bhagavan&quot;
* &quot;Krishna&quot;: argues that Krishna is supreme
* &quot;Bhakti&quot;: describes the process of attaining love for Krishna, &quot;bhakti&quot; or devotion. Outlines two types of &quot;bhakti&quot;: mixed and pure.
* &quot;Priti&quot;: argues that &quot;priti&quot; (love) for Bhagavan is the highest goal (&quot;prayojana&quot;) of life

==Devotional activities==
===Bhakti Yoga===

The practical process of performing devotional acts in ones life is described as &quot;bhakti&quot; or &quot;bhakti-yoga,&quot; and is supported by activities of nine different types. The two distinct divisions of &quot;sadhana-bhakti&quot; are &quot;vaidhi-bhakti&quot; and &quot;raganuga-bhakti&quot;. Rupa Goswami defines &quot;vaidhi-bhakti&quot; as that &quot;bhakti&quot; which is taken up not by natural liking but by consideration of scriptural injunctions. He describes the two categories of the highest &quot;bhakti&quot; as &quot;bhava-bhakti&quot; (devotion via feelings of intense emotion) and &quot;prema-bhakti&quot; (devotion of love). The two are essentially different intensities of the same participation in devotion via emotional expression. &quot;Raganuga-bhakti&quot;, on the other hand, follows &quot;ragatmika-bhakti,&quot; the &quot;bhakti&quot; present in Krishna&#x27;s eternal associates, which is driven by &quot;raga&quot;, a natural absorption in the object of service. Jiva Goswami&#x27;s conclusion in &quot;Bhakti Sandarbha&quot; is that &quot;raganuga-bhakti&quot; is the only &quot;abhidheya&quot;, viable process, recommended by the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot;. The goal of &quot;raganuga-bhakti&quot; is for the &quot;jiva&quot; to realize its true essential nature.

Within his &quot;Siksastaka&quot; prayers, Chaitanya compares the process of &quot;bhakti-yoga&quot; to that of cleansing a dirty place of dust, wherein our consciousness is the object in need of purification. This purification takes place largely through the chanting and singing of Radha and Krishna&#x27;s names. Specifically, the Hare Krishna (mantra) is chanted and sung by practitioners on a daily basis, sometimes for many hours each day. Famously within the tradition, one of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&#x27;s close associates, Haridasa Thakur, is reported to have chanted 300,000 holy names of God each day.

===Diet and lifestyle===
Gaudiya Vaishnavas follow a vegetarian diet, abstaining from all types of animal flesh, fish and eggs. Onion and garlic are also avoided as they are believed to promote a &quot;tamasic&quot; and &quot;rajasic&quot; form of consciousness in the eater. Some Gaudiya Vaishnavas, mainly from ISKCON and Gaudiya Matha, also avoid the intake of caffeine, as they believe it is addictive and an intoxicant.

=== Attitude toward scriptures ===
Chaitanya Vaishnava traditions refer to the writings of previous acharyas in their respective lineage or &quot;sampradya&quot; as authoritative interpretations of scripture. While many schools like Smartism and Advaitism encourage interpretation of scriptures philosophically and metaphorically and not too literally, Chaitanya Vaishnavism stresses the literal meaning (&#x27;) as primary and indirect meaning (&#x27;) as secondary: &quot;&quot; - &quot;The instructions of the should be accepted literally, without &quot;fanciful or allegorical interpretations&quot;.&quot;

==Sampradaya and parampara==
A &quot;Guru—shishya tradition&quot; (&quot;lineage&quot; or parampara) denotes a succession of teachers and disciples within some sampradaya (school, tradition). In accordance with the tradition, Gaudiya Vaishnavism as a subschool belongs to the Brahma Sampradaya, one of the four &quot;orthodox&quot; Vaishnavite schools. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is said to be a disciple of Isvara Puri (fl. 14th century) who was a disciple of Madhavendra Puri (fl. 14th century) who was a disciple of Lakshmipati Tirtha (1420–1487) who was a disciple of Vyasatirtha (1469–1539) of the Madhva Sampradaya. The Gaudiya Vaishnavas call their tradition &quot;Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya&quot;, which originates from Brahma and has Madhvacharya as the original acharya and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as the acharya-successor.

However, this traditional point is at least debatable. Some modern scholars and confessional authors critically assess and pair the Gaudiya Vaishnavism&#x27;s affiliation with the Madhva tradition. For example, the famous American Indologist and historian of religion Guy L. Beck, with regard to the Chaitanya Sampradaya, notes the following historical events. The first time the Brahma-Madhva affiliation of Gaudiya Vaishnavism was propounded by Baladeva Vidyabhushana was in the 18th century. And to this day, there is no mention of Chaitanya in the annals of the Madhva Sampradaya. For secular scientists this means, originality and non-affiliation of Gaudiya Vaishnavism with other previous branches. At the same time, there is the consensus of scholars, that Chaitanya was initiated by the two gurus of a Vaishnava-oriented group within Adi Shankara&#x27;s Dashanami order.

The &quot;Prameya Ratnawali&quot; of the above-mentioned gaudiya-acharya Baladeva Vidyabhushana contains the following canonical list of disciplic succession: Krishna, Brahma, Narada, Vyasa, Madhva, Padmanabha, Nrihari, Madhava, Akshobhya, Jayatirtha, Gyanasindhu, Dayanidhi, Vidyanidhi, Rajendra, Jayadharma, Purushottama, Brahmanya, Vyasatirtha, Lakshmipati Tirtha, Madhavendra Puri, Isvara Puri, and Chaitanya.

One feature of the Gaudiya succession of spiritual masters should be considered. Chaitanya refused to formally initiate anyone as a disciple, only inspiring and guiding his followers. Chaitanya neither founded the community nor named a successor. That is why, from the very beginning, the sampradaya was divided into several lines of succession that were practically not connected with each other and that still exist today. One of them, namely, the Gaudiya-Sarasvata Sampradaya, belongs to the well known International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

==History==
===Chaitanya Mahaprabhu===
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (also transliterated Caitanya, IAST &quot;&quot;; 1486–1534) was a Bengali spiritual teacher who founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism. He is believed by his devotees to be Krishna himself who appeared in the form of His own devotee in order to teach the people of this world the process of Bhakti and how to attain the perfection of life. This they say with several evidences in scripture. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is said to be a disciple of Isvara Puri who was a disciple of Madhavendra Puri who was a disciple of Lakshmipati Tirtha who was a disciple of Vyasatirtha(1469–1539) of Madhvacharya&#x27;s Sampradaya. He is considered as the most merciful manifestation of Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was the proponent for the Vaishnava school of Bhakti yoga (meaning loving devotion to God), based on &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. Of various incarnations of Vishnu, he is revered as Krishna, popularised the chanting of the &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; mantra and composed the &quot;Siksastakam&quot; (eight devotional prayers) in Sanskrit. His followers, Gaudiya Vaishnavas, revere him as a Krishna with the mood and complexion of his source of inspiration Radha.

===Early growth===

Over the three centuries following the disappearance of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition evolved into the form in which we largely find it today in contemporary India. In the early years of the tradition, the followers of Nityananda Prabhu, Advaita Acharya and other companions of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu educated and initiated people, each in their own locales across Bengal.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu requested a select few among his followers, who later came to be known as the Six Gosvamis of Vrindavan, to systematically present his theology of bhakti in their writings. This theology emphasized the devotee&#x27;s relationship to the Divine Couple, Radha and Krishna, and looked to Chaitanya as the embodiment of both Radha and Krishna. The six were Rupa Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Gopala Bhatta Goswami, Raghunatha Bhatta Goswami, Raghunatha dasa Goswami and Jiva Goswami. In the second generation of the tradition, Narottama, Srinivasa and Shyamananda, three students of Jiva Goswami, the youngest among the six Goswamis, were instrumental in spreading the theology across Bengal and Orissa.

The festival of Kheturi (approx 1574), presided over by Jahnava Thakurani, the wife of Nityananda Rama, was the first time the leaders of the various branches of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&#x27;s followers assembled together. Through such festivals, members of the loosely organized tradition became acquainted with other branches along with their respective theological and practical nuances. That notwithstanding, the tradition has maintained its plural nature, having no central authority to preside over its matters. The festival of Kheturi allowed for the systemization of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology as a distinct branch of Vaishnava theology.

===17th–18th century===
During the 17th–18th centuries, there was a period of general decline in the movement&#x27;s strength and popularity, its &quot;lethargic state&quot;, characterized by decreased public preaching and the rise of persons following and promoting tantric teachings and practices. These groups are called &quot;apasampradayas&quot; by the Chaitanyaits.

In the 17th century, Vishvanath Chakravarti Thakur held great merit in clarifying core doctrinal issues over the practice of &quot;raganuga-bhakti&quot; through works such as &quot;Raga-vartma-chandrika&quot;. His student Baladeva Vidyabhushan wrote a famous commentary on the Vedanta-sutra called Govinda Bhashya.

The 18th century saw a number of luminaries headed by Siddha Jayakrishna Das Babaji of Kamyavan and Siddha Krishnadas Babaji of Govardhan. The latter, a widely renowned teacher of the mode of internal worship (&quot;raga-bhajan&quot;) practiced in the tradition, is largely responsible for the current form of devotional practice embraced by some of the traditions based in Vrindavan.

====Manipuri Vaishnavism====

The &quot;Manipuri Vaishnavism&quot; is a regional form of Gaudiya Vaishnavism with a culture-forming role among the Meitei people in the north-eastern Indian state of Manipur. There, after a short period of Ramaism penetration, Gaudiya Vaishnavism spread in the early 18th century, especially from beginning its second quarter. Raja Gharib Nawaz (Pamheiba) was initiated into the Chaitanya tradition. Most devotee ruler and propagandist of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, under the influence of Natottama Thakura&#x27;s disciples, was raja Bhagyachandra, who has visited the holy for the Chaytanyaits Nabadwip. &quot;Rasa Lila&quot; dance became a feature of the regional folk and religious tradition.

=== 20th century ===


From the very beginning of Chaitanya&#x27;s &quot;bhakti&quot; movement in Bengal, Haridasa Thakur and others Muslim by birth were the participants. This openness received a boost from Bhaktivinoda Thakur&#x27;s broad-minded vision in the late 19th century, Baba Premananda Bharati&#x27;s mission in the United States in the beginning of 20th century and was institutionalized by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur in his Gaudiya Math in the 20th century.

A renaissance began at the start of the 20th century both in India and the West. One pioneer of the Gaudiya Vaishnavite mission in the West was Baba Premananda Bharati (1858–1914), author of &quot;Sree Krishna – the Lord of Love&quot; (1904) – the first full-length treatment of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in English, who, in 1902, founded the short-lived &quot;Krishna Samaj&quot; society in New York City and built a temple in Los Angeles. He belonged to the circle of adherents of the guru Prabhu Jagadbandhu with teachings similar to the later ISKCON mission. His followers formed several organizations including the now defunct Order of Living Service and the AUM Temple of Universal Truth.

The reform change of traditional caste Gaudiya Vaishnavism of 19th century is believed to have happened largely in India due to the efforts of a particularly adept preacher known as Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who also held the position of a deputy magistrate with the British government. Bhaktivinoda Thakur&#x27;s son grew up to be both an eminent scholar and a highly influential Vaishnava preacher, and was later known as Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. In 1920, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati founded Gaudiya Math in India, and later sixty-four Gaudiya Matha monasteries in India, Burma and Europe. In 1933, the first European preaching center was established in London (London Glouster House, Cornwall Garden, W7 South Kensington) under the name &quot;Gaudiya Mission Society of London&quot;.

Soon after Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati&#x27;s death (1 January 1937), a dispute began, which divided the original Gaudiya Math mission into two administrative bodies still in existence today. In a settlement, they divided the sixty-four Gaudiya Math centers into two groups: the Sri Chaitanya Math headed by Bhakti Vilasa Tirtha Maharaj and the Gaudiya Mission headed by Ananta Vasudev (Bhakti Prasad Puri Maharaj).

Many of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati&#x27;s disciples disagreed with the spirit of these two factions and/or started their own missions to expand their guru&#x27;s mission. In the 1960s, the one of his disciples, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada went to the West to spread Gaudiya-Vaishnavism and establish the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), &quot;the most successful of the Gaudiya Math&#x27;s offspring,&quot; an organization that continues today.

However, despite the active missionary work of the reformed Gaudiya Math and its followers, most of the Gaudiya Vaishnava community in India remained under the influence of hereditary brahmins-&quot;goswamis&quot;, who run famous old Gaudiya mandirs, as one example, the Radha Raman Temple in Vrindavan and its prominent scholar-acharya Shrivatsa Goswami.

==Gaudiya and other Vaishnava schools==
Although sharing a common set of core beliefs, there are a number of philosophical differences which distinguish Gaudiya Vaishnavism from other Vaishnava schools:
* In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Krishna is seen as the original form of God, i.e. the source of Vishnu and not as His avatar. This is based primarily on verse 1.3.28 of the Bhagavata Purana (&quot;krsnas tu bhagavan svayam&quot;) and other scriptures. This belief is shared by the Nimbarka and Vallabha sampradayas, but not by the Ramanuja and Madhva schools, who view Krishna as an avatar of Vishnu.
* As Krishna&#x27;s consort, Radha is similarly viewed as the source of all other Shaktis, including Lakshmi and Sita.
* Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is worshiped as the most recent i.e. ninth avatar of Krishna to descend in the current yuga, or age. Other &quot;sampradayas&quot; view Chaitanya as a devotee of Krishna only, and not Krishna himself or a form of avatar. According to his biographies, Chaitanya did not display himself as Krishna in public, and would, in fact, avoid being addressed as such. In this regard A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami states, &quot;[When] addressed as Lord Krishna, He denied it. Indeed, He sometimes placed His hands over His ears, protesting that one should not be addressed as the Supreme Lord&quot;. However at times Chaitanya would exhibit a different mood and would welcome worship of himself as the Supreme Lord, and at a few occasions, is said to have exhibited his Universal form. Rupa Goswami, when first meeting with Chaitanya, composed the following verse showing his belief in Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&#x27;s divinity:

&quot;O most munificent incarnation! You are Krishna Himself appearing as Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. You have assumed the golden colour of Srimati Radharani, and You are widely distributing pure love of Krishna. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.&quot; 
Although this viewpoint outside of the Gaudiya tradition was disputed, Chaitanya&#x27;s followers prove it by pointing at verses throughout the Puranic literatures as evidence to support this claim. Evidences such as the Krishna-varnam verse SB 11.5.32 have many interpretations by scholars, including Sridhara Svami who is accepted as authority by Mahaprabhu himself.

===Theological sources===
Gaudiya Vaishnava theology is prominently expounded by Jiva Goswami in his &quot;Sat-sandarbhas&quot;, which are six elaborate treatises on various aspects of God. Other prominent Gaudiya Vaishnava theologians include his uncles, Rupa Gosvami, the author of &quot;Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu,&quot; and Sanatana Gosvami, the author of &quot;Hari-bhakti-vilasa&quot;, Visvanatha Chakravarti, the author of &quot;Sri Camatkara-candrika&quot; and Baladeva Vidyabhushana, author of &quot;Govinda Bhashya&quot;.

Jiva Gosvami frequently references Sridhara Swami, particularly quoting from Sridhara Swami&#x27;s commentary on the Bhagavata Purana (Bhavartha-dipika), throughout the Sat-sandarbhas. In the &quot;Catuhsutri&quot; section of the &quot;Paramatma-sandarbha&quot;, Jiva Gosvami references Ramanuja&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;.

==Modern Gaudiya Vaishnava societies==
The strictly centralized form of church-type organization and the idea that one has to be an unconventional (&quot;uttama&quot;) spiritual master introduced by the reformer Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and his Gaudiya Math were not characteristic of the traditional Gaudiya Vaishnavism with its hereditary brahmins-goswamis and family teachers (&quot;kula gurus&quot;). Much of the Gaudiya Vaishnava community in India remained committed to the unreformed and loosely organized tradition. Many modern organisations are independent branches of the tree of the Gaudiya Math.

Many of branches of the Gaudiya Math (not all) are members of the World Vaisnava Association – Visva Vaisnava Raj Sabha (WVA–VVRS), which had been established in 1994 by some Gaudiya leaders. But after this establishment, there is little real cooperation among Gaudiya organisations.

===Demography===
There are adherents of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in all strata of Indian society, but a tendency has been revealed, Bengali Vaishnavas belong to the lower middle castes (&quot;middle class&quot;), while the upper castes as well as lowest castes and tribes in Bengal are Shaktas.

==Offshoots of Gaudiya Vaishnavism==
There are Krishnaite gurus and groups who belong to the Chaitanya lineage, but actually separated from Gaudiya Vaishnavism, becoming new independent movements.

<text>QUIKTRAN is a Fortran-like, interactive computer programming language with debugging facilities. 

More than a Fortran-based programming language, QUIKTRAN was IBM&#x27;s first entry in on-line Time Sharing in the 1960s. It ran on an IBM 7040/7044, using an IBM 7740 as a dial up communications processor. In 1967 an IBM data center supported over 400 commercial customers in a time-sharing environment; users could dial up and log into the Quiktran system. They could store their own Fortran programs in private libraries for later execution, or execute numerous IBM-supplied programs for applications including linear programming, communication network design, and business programs. The system on the receiving end allowed teletype or typewriter keyboards using data phones or acoustic modems to connect. It could support approximately 50 simultaneous users, The hardware used was an IBM 1301 40-platter disk for storage, and an IBM 7320 Magnetic Drum for program swapping. The QUIKTRAN system was superseded by Call/360. Quiktran and Call/360 were supported by Service Bureau Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM. SBC was later sold to Minneapolis-based company (Control Data Corporation).

<text>SIMSCRIPT is a free-form, English-like general-purpose simulation language conceived by Harry Markowitz and Bernard Hausner at the RAND Corporation in 1962. It was implemented as a Fortran preprocessor on the IBM 7090 and was designed for large discrete event simulations. It influenced Simula.

Though earlier versions were released into the public domain, SIMSCRIPT was commercialized by Markowitz&#x27;s company, California Analysis Center, Inc. (CACI), which produced proprietary versions SIMSCRIPT I.5 and SIMSCRIPT II.5.

==SIMSCRIPT II.5==
SIMSCRIPT II.5 was the last pre-PC incarnation of SIMSCRIPT, one of the oldest computer simulation languages. Although military contractor CACI released it in 1971, it still enjoys wide use in large-scale military and air-traffic control simulations.

:&quot;SIMSCRIPT II.5 is a powerful, free-form, English-like, general-purpose simulation programming language. It supports the application of software engineering principles, such as structured programming and modularity, which impart orderliness and manageability to simulation models.&quot;
==SIMSCRIPT III==
&quot;SIMSCRIPT III&quot; &quot;Release 4.0&quot; was available by 2009, and by then it ran on Windows 7, SUN OS and Linux and has object-oriented features.

By 1997, SIMSCRIPT III already had a GUI interface to its compiler. The latest version is &quot;Release 5&quot;; earlier versions already supported 64-bit processing.

==PL/I implementation==
A PL/I implementation was developed during 1968–1969, based on the public domain version released by RAND corporation.

PROMAL features simple syntax, no line numbers, long variable names, functions and procedures with argument passing, real number type, arrays, strings, pointer, and a built-in I/O library. Like ABC and Python, indentation is part of the language syntax.

The language uses a single-pass compiler to generate byte code that is interpreted when the program is run. The compiler can compile to/from disk and memory. The software package for C64 includes a full-screen editor and command shell.

==Reception==
&quot;Ahoy!&quot; called PROMAL for the Commodore 64 &quot;one of the best&quot; structured languages. It concluded &quot;As an introduction to structured programming languages and as an alternative to BASIC, PROMAL is well worth the time needed to learn it and the $49.95 to purchase it&quot;.

==Example code==
From the PROMAL program disk:

 PROGRAM SIEVE
 ; Sieve of Eratosthenes Benchmark
 ; test (BYTE magazine)
 ; 10 iterations, 1800 element array.
 INCLUDE LIBRARY
 CON SIZE=1800
 WORD I
 WORD J
 WORD PRIME
 WORD K
 WORD COUNT
 BYTE FLAGS[SIZE]
 BEGIN
 OUTPUT &quot;10 ITERATIONS&quot;
 FOR J= 1 TO 10
 COUNT=0
 FILL FLAGS, SIZE, TRUE
 FOR I= 0 TO SIZE
 IF FLAGS[I]
 PRIME=I+I+3
 K=I+PRIME
 WHILE K &lt;= SIZE
 FLAGS[K]=FALSE

<text>C* (or C-star) is a data-parallel superset of ANSI C with synchronous semantics.

==History==
It was developed in 1987 as an alternative language to *Lisp and CM-Fortran for the Connection Machine CM-2 and above. The language C* adds to C a &quot;domain&quot; data type and a selection statement for parallel execution in domains.

For the CM-2 models the C* compiler translated the code into serial C, calling PARIS (Parallel Instruction Set) functions, and passed the resulting code to the front end computer&#x27;s native compiler. The resulting executables were executed on the front end computer with PARIS calls being executed on the Connection Machine.

On the CM-5 and CM-5E parallel C* Code was executed in a SIMD style fashion on processing elements, whereas serial code was executed on the PM (Partition Manager) Node, with the PM acting as a &quot;front end&quot; if directly compared to a CM-2.
The latest version of C* as of 27 August 1993 is 6.x.
An unimplemented language dubbed &quot;Parallel C&quot; (not to be confused with Unified Parallel C) influenced the design of C*. Dataparallel-C was based on C*.

<text>CAD/CAM refers to the integration of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). Both of these require powerful computers. &quot;CAD&quot; (COMPUTER ADDED DESIGN) software helps designers and draftsmen; &quot;CAM&quot; &quot;reduces manpower costs&quot; in the manufacturing process.

==Overview==
Both &quot;CAD&quot; and &quot;CAM&quot; are computer-intensive. Although, in 1981, Computervision was #1 and IBM was #2, IBM had a major advantage: its systems could accommodate &quot;eight to 20&quot; users at a time, whereas most competitors only had enough power to accommodate &quot;four to six.&quot; &quot;CAD/CAM&quot; was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;computerized design and manufacturing process&quot; that made its debut &quot;when Computervision pioneered it in the 1970&#x27;s.&quot;

Other 1980s major players in &quot;CAD/CAM&quot; included General Electric and Parametric Technology Corporation; the latter subsequently acquired Computervision, which had been acquired by Prime Computer.

CAD/CAM originated in the 1960s; an IBM 360/44 was used to build via &quot;CNC&quot; the wings of an airplane.

==Computer-aided design (CAD)==

One goal of CAD is to allow quicker iterations in the design process; another is to enable smoothly transitioning to the CAM stage. Although manually created drawings historically facilitated &quot;a designer&#x27;s goal of displaying an idea,&quot; it did not result in a machine-readable result that could be modified
and subsequently be used to directly build a prototype. It can also be used to &quot;ensure that all the separate parts of a product will fit together as intended.&quot;

&quot;CAD&quot;, when linked with simulation, can also enable bypassing building a less than satisfactory test version, resulting in having &quot;dispensed with the costly, time-consuming task of building a prototype.&quot;

==Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)==
In &quot;Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)&quot;, using computerized specifications, a computer directs machines such as lathes and milling machines to perform work that otherwise would be controlled by a lathe or milling machine operator. This process, which is called Numerical Control (NC OR CNC), is what came to be known as 20th century Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and it originated in the 1960s. Early 21st century &quot;CAM&quot; introduced use of &quot;3D printers&quot;.

&quot;CAM&quot;, although it requires initial expenditures for equipment, covers this outlay with reduced labor cost and speedy transition from
&quot;CAD&quot; to finished product, especially when the result is both timely and &quot;ensuring one-time machining success rate.&quot;

<doc id="1064182" wikidata="Q5021477" url="?curid=1064182" title="Call-with-current-continuation">
<text>In the Scheme computer programming language, the procedure call-with-current-continuation, abbreviated call/cc, is used as a control flow operator. It has been adopted by several other programming languages.

Taking a function codice_1 as its only argument, codice_2 within an expression is applied to the current continuation of the expression.
For example codice_3 is equivalent to applying codice_1 to the current continuation of the expression. The current continuation is given by replacing codice_2 by a variable codice_6 bound by a lambda abstraction, so the current continuation is codice_7. Applying the function codice_1 to it gives the final result codice_9. 

As a complementary example, in an expression codice_10, the continuation for the sub-expression codice_2 is codice_12, so the whole expression is equivalent to codice_13.
In other words it takes a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the current control context or control state of the program as an object and applies codice_1 to it. 
The continuation object is a first-class value and is represented as a function, with function application as its only operation. When a continuation object is applied to an argument, the existing continuation is eliminated and the applied continuation is restored in its place, so that the program flow will continue at the point at which the continuation was captured and &quot;the argument of the continuation&quot; then becomes the &quot;return value&quot; of the call/cc invocation. Continuations created with call/cc may be called more than once, and even from outside the dynamic extent of the call/cc application.

In computer science, making this type of implicit program state visible as an object is termed &quot;reification&quot;. (Scheme does not syntactically distinguish between applying continuations or functions.)

With call/cc a variety of complex control operators can be implemented from other languages via a few lines of code, e.g., McCarthy&#x27;s codice_15 operator for nondeterministic choice, Prolog-style backtracking, Simula 67-style coroutines and generalizations thereof, Icon-style generators, or engines and threads or even the obscure COMEFROM.

== Examples ==
As shown by the next example, call/cc can be used to emulate the function of the return statement known from C-style languages, which is missing from Scheme:
(define (f return) 
 (return 2) 
 3)

(f (lambda (x) x))
=&gt; 3

(call-with-current-continuation f)
=&gt; 2
Calling &quot;f&quot; with a regular function argument first applies this function to the value 2, then returns 3. However, when &quot;f&quot; is passed to call/cc (as in the last line of the example), applying the parameter (the continuation) to 2 forces execution of the program to jump to the point where call/cc was called, and causes call/cc to return the value 2. This is then printed by the display function.

In the next example, call/cc is used twice: once to generate a &quot;return&quot; continuation as in the first example and once to suspend an iteration through a list of items:
;; [LISTOF X] -&gt; ( -&gt; X u &#x27;you-fell-off-the-end)
(define (generate-one-element-at-a-time lst)
 ;; Both internal functions are closures over lst

 ;; Internal variable/Function which passes the current element in a list
 ;; to its return argument (which is a continuation), or passes an end-of-list marker 
 ;; if no more elements are left. On each step the function name is 
 ;; rebound to a continuation which points back into the function body,
 ;; while return is rebound to whatever continuation the caller specifies.
 (define (control-state return)
 (for-each 
 (lambda (element)
 (set! return (call-with-current-continuation
 (lambda (resume-here)
 ;; Grab the current continuation
 (set! control-state resume-here)
 (return element))))) ;; (return element) evaluates to next return
 lst)
 (return &#x27;you-fell-off-the-end))
 ;; (-&gt; X u &#x27;you-fell-off-the-end)
 ;; This is the actual generator, producing one item from a-list at a time.
 (define (generator)
 (call-with-current-continuation control-state))

 ;; Return the generator 
 generator)

(define generate-digit
 (generate-one-element-at-a-time &#x27;(0 1 2)))

(generate-digit) ;; 0
(generate-digit) ;; 1
(generate-digit) ;; 2
(generate-digit) ;; you-fell-off-the-end
Every time the loop is about to process another item from the list, the function grabs the current continuation, and assigns it to the variable &#x27;control-state&#x27;. This variable initially is the closure that iterates through all elements of the list. As the computation progresses, it becomes a closure that iterates through a suffix of the given list. While the use of &quot;call/cc&quot; is unnecessary for a linear collection, such as codice_16, the code generalizes to &quot;any&quot; collection that can be traversed.

Call-with-current-continuation can also express other sophisticated primitives. For example, the next sample performs cooperative multitasking using continuations:
;; Cooperative multitasking using call-with-current-continuation
;; in 25 lines of scheme

;; The list of threads waiting to run. This is a list of one
;; argument non-returning functions (continuations, mostly)
;; A continuation is a non-returning function, just like (exit),
;; in that it never gives up control to whatever called it.

(define ready-list &#x27;())

;; A non-returning function. If there is any other thread
;; waiting to be run, it causes the next thread to run if there
;; is any left to run, otherwise it calls the original exit
;; which exits the whole environment.
(define exit
 ;; The original exit which we override.
 (let ((exit exit))
 ;; The overriding function.
 (lambda ()
 (if (not (null? ready-list))
 ;; There is another thread waiting to be run.
 ;; So we run it.
 (let ((cont (car ready-list)))
 (set! ready-list (cdr ready-list))
 ;; Since the ready-list is only non-returning
 ;; functions, this will not return.
 (cont #f))
 ;; Nothing left to run.
 ;; The original (exit) is a non returning function,
 ;; so this is a non-returning function.
 (exit)))))

;; Takes a one argument function with a given
;; argument and forks it off. The forked function&#x27;s new
;; thread will exit if/when the function ever exits.
(define (fork fn arg)
 (set! ready-list
 (append ready-list
 ;; This function added to the 
 ;; ready-list is non-returning,
 ;; since exit is non returning.
 (list
 (lambda (x)
 (fn arg)
 (exit))))))

;; Gives up control for the next thread waiting to be run.
;; Although it will eventually return, it gives up control
;; and will only regain it when the continuation is called.
(define (yield)
 (call-with-current-continuation
 ;; Capture the continuation representing THIS call to yield
 (lambda (cont)
 ;; Stick it on the ready list
 (set! ready-list
 (append ready-list
 (list cont)))
 ;; Get the next thread, and start it running.
 (let ((cont (car ready-list)))
 (set! ready-list (cdr ready-list))
 ;; Run it.
 (cont #f)))))
In 1999, David Madore (inventor of the Unlambda programming language) accidentally discovered a 12-character Unlambda term, making use of call/cc, that printed all natural numbers sequentially in unary representation: codice_17. This program and the apparent mystery surrounding its effect have attracted some attention, and are commonly known as the &quot;yin-yang puzzle&quot;. A Scheme translation, provided by Madore, is as follows:
(let* ((yin
 ((lambda (cc) (display #\@) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c))))
 (yang
 ((lambda (cc) (display #\*) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c)))))
 (yin yang))
== Criticism==
Oleg Kiselyov, author of a delimited continuation implementation for OCaml, and designer of an application programming interface (API) for delimited stack manipulation to implement control operators, advocates the use of delimited continuations instead of the full-stack continuations that call/cc manipulates: &quot;Offering call/cc as a core control feature in terms of which all other control facilities should be implemented turns out a bad idea. Performance, memory and resource leaks, ease of implementation, ease of use, ease of reasoning all argue against call/cc.&quot;

== Relation to non-constructive logic ==
The Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs relates &quot;call/cc&quot; to Peirce&#x27;s law, which extends intuitionistic logic to non-constructive, classical logic: ((α → β) → α) → α. Here, ((α → β) → α) is the type of the function &quot;f&quot;, which can either return a value of type α directly or apply an argument to the continuation of type (α → β). Since the existing context is deleted when the continuation is applied, the type β is never used and may be taken to be ⊥, the empty type.

The principle of double negation elimination ((α → ⊥) → ⊥) → α is comparable to a variant of call-cc which expects its argument &quot;f&quot; to always evaluate the current continuation without normally returning a value.
Embeddings of classical logic into intuitionistic logic are related to continuation passing style translation.
