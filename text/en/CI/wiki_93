<text>A thrall was a slave or serf in Scandinavian lands during the Viking Age. The status of slave (, ) contrasts with that of the freeman (, ) and the nobleman (, ).

==Etymology==
Thrall is from the Old Norse , meaning a person who is in bondage or serfdom. The Old Norse term was lent into late Old English, as . 
The term is from a Common Germanic (&quot;runner&quot;, from a root &quot;to run&quot;). Old High German had a cognate, , meaning &quot;servant, runner&quot;.
The English derivation &quot;thraldom&quot; is of High Medieval date. The verb &quot;to enthrall&quot; is of Early Modern origin (metaphorical use from the 1570s, literal use from 1610).

The corresponding term in Old English was (from Proto-Germanic , perhaps from a PIE root , &quot;to run&quot;). A related Old English term is &quot;labourer, hireling&quot; (from Germanic , cognate with Gothic &quot;hireling&quot;, a derivation from &quot;reward&quot;, from the same root as English &quot;earn&quot;).

The term was borrowed into Irish as , where it is used interchangeably with which is a cognate of the English slave (likewise for Slav is disputed).

Thrall was known by similar words in other old languages (, , , , , ).
The Middle Latin rendition of the term in early Germanic law is .

==Early Germanic law==

The &quot;thrall&quot; represents the lowest of the three-tiered social order of the Germanic peoples, noblemen, freemen and slaves, in Old Norse , and (c.f. &quot;Rígsþula&quot;), in Old English corresponding to , and , in Old Frisian , , , etc.
The division is of importance in the Germanic law codes, which make special provisions for slaves, who were property and could be bought and sold, but they also enjoyed some degree of protection under the law.

The death of a freeman was compensated by a weregild, usually calculated at 200 solidi (shillings) for a freeman, whereas the death of a slave was treated as loss of property to his owner and compensated depending on the value of the worker.

==Society==
Thralls were the lowest class of workers in Scandinavian society. They were Europeans who were enslaved by being prisoners of war, incurring debt or being born into the class via their parents. The living conditions of thralls in Scandinavia varied depending on the master. The thrall trade as the prize of plunder was a key part of the Viking economy. While there are some estimates of as many as thirty slaves per household, most families owned only one or two slaves.

In 1043, Hallvard Vebjørnsson, the son of a local nobleman in the district of greater Lier, was killed while he was trying to defend a thrall woman from men who accused her of theft. The Church strongly approved of his action, recognised him as a martyr and canonized him as Saint Hallvard, the patron saint of Oslo.

Despite the existence of a caste system, thralls could experience a level of social fluidity. They could be freed by their masters at any time, be freed in a will or even buy their own freedom. Once a thrall man was freed, he became a &quot;freedman&quot;, or leysingi, a member of an intermediary group between slaves and freemen. He still owed allegiance to his former master and had to vote according to his former master&#x27;s wishes. It took at least two generations for freedmen to lose the allegiance to their former masters and become full freemen. If a freedman had no descendants, his former master inherited his land and property.

While thralls and freedmen did not have much economic or political power in Scandinavia, they were still given a wergeld, or a man&#x27;s price: there was a monetary penalty for unlawfully killing a slave.

The era of Viking raids resulting in the capture of slaves slowly started to end in the 11th century. In the following centuries, more thralls obtained their freedom, either by purchasing it or on the initiative of their masters, the Church or the secular authority.

<doc id="1076482" wikidata="Q2838270" url="?curid=1076482" title="Oloroso">
<text>Oloroso (&quot;scented&quot; in English) is a variety of fortified wine (sherry) made in Jerez and Montilla-Moriles and produced by oxidative aging. It is normally darker than Amontillado. Oloroso is usually dark and nutty. 

Unlike the fino and Amontillado sherries, in oloroso the flor yeast is suppressed by fortification at an earlier stage. This causes the finished wine to lack the fresh yeasty taste of the fino sherries. Without the layer of flor, the sherry is exposed to air through the slightly porous walls of the American or Canadian oak casks and undergoes oxidative aging. As the wine ages, it becomes darker and stronger and is often left for many decades.

Oloroso sherry is also the base for many of the sweet sherries developed for the international market, such as Bristol Cream, in which oloroso is sweetened and sometimes has the color removed by charcoal filtering to achieve the desired effect.

==Varieties==
* Oloroso del Puerto is an oloroso from El Puerto de Santa María.
* Manzanilla Olorosa is a manzanilla aged to the point that it takes on the quality of an Oloroso.

==Serving==
Olorosos are dry, not sweet. Wines labelled as &quot;Rich Oloroso&quot;, &quot;Sweet Oloroso&quot; or &quot;Oloroso Dulce&quot; were banned by the Andalusian regional government on 12 April 2012. They will have to be re-labelled as &quot;Cream Sherry: Blend of Oloroso&quot;. The rules applicable to the sweet and fortified denominaciones de origen Montilla-Moriles and Jerez-Xérès-Sherry are:

For the full rules for the sweetness of Sherry see Sweetness of wine.

Oloroso should be served at 12–14 °C, and can be served as an apéritif with nuts, olives or figs, with game and red meats, or after a meal with rich cheeses. Sweetened Oloroso can also be taken as a long drink with ice. Cream Sherries, which are Oloroso sweetened by blending with Pedro Ximénez wine, should also be served at 12–14 °C and are usually served after a meal as a dessert wine. They can also be served with certain dishes, such as foie gras.

==Storing==
Because Oloroso Sherries have already been through years of oxidative aging, they can be safely stored for years before opening. Once opened, Oloroso will slowly lose some of its aroma and flavor, but can be kept corked and refrigerated for up to two months after opening. The older the Oloroso, the longer it will remain flavorful and drinkable - as long as 12 months.

==Other uses==
Historically the casks used to ship Oloroso Sherry to the UK, often remained in the UK where they were used in Scotland and Ireland to age whisky. Since the Spanish government changed the export laws in 1981, stipulating that sherry must be bottled in Spain, sherry casks are now manufactured purely for the whisky industry—by seasoning casks with Oloroso or other sherry prior to the distilleries using them to age their whisky. It&#x27;s extremely rare that a cask used by a sherry Bodega to actually age sherry is used in the production of whisky. Single malt whisky aged in sherry casks is regarded by some as a special category with its own aficionados. This category usually refers to whether the whisky was finished (aged first in another cask and then transferred to an Oloroso cask or butt for finishing), or fully matured (taken directly off the still and matured entirely in a cask that once held Oloroso). The Oloroso wine infused in the wood of the casks imparts some of the flavor and aroma of the wine to the whisky during the aging process. Oloroso casks are also used to age brandy for the same reasons. A whisky that was matured only in Oloroso casks is often fruitier, with stronger notes of tobacco, pepper, and stewed fruits.

<doc id="1076499" wikidata="Q375471" url="?curid=1076499" title="Student exchange program">
<text>A student exchange program is a program in which students from a secondary school (high school) or higher education study abroad at one of their institution&#x27;s partner institutions.
A student exchange program may involve international travel, but does not necessarily require the student to study outside their home country.

Foreign exchange programs provide students with an opportunity to study in another country and experience a different environment. These programs provide opportunities that may not be available in the participant&#x27;s home country, such as learning about the history and culture of other countries and meeting new friends to enrich their personal development. International exchange programs are also effective to challenge students to develop a global perspective.

The term &quot;exchange&quot; means that a partner institution accepts a student, but does not necessarily mean that the students have to find a counterpart from the other institution with whom to exchange. Exchange students live with a host family or in a designated place such as a hostel, an apartment, or a student lodging. Costs for the program vary by the country and institution. Participants fund their participation via scholarships, loans, or self-funding.

Student exchanges became popular after World War II, intended to increase the participants&#x27; understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Student exchanges also increased further after the end of the Cold War. An exchange student typically stays in the host country for a period of 6 to 12 months; however, exchange students may opt to stay for one semester at a time. International students or those on study abroad programs may stay in the host country for several years. Some exchange programs also offer academic credit.

Students of study abroad programs aim to develop a global perspective and cultural understanding by challenging their comfort zones and immersing themselves in a different culture. Studies have shown that students&#x27; desire to study abroad has increased, and research suggests that students choose programs because of location, costs, available resources and heritage. Although there are many different exchange programs, most popular are the programs that offer academic credit, as many students are concerned about traveling hindering their academic and professional plans.

== Types of exchange programs ==

=== Short-term exchange ===
A short-term exchange program is also known as STEP. These focus on home-stays, language skills, community service, or cultural activities. High school and university students can apply for the programs through various government or non-governmental organizations that organize the programs. A short-term exchange lasts from one week to three months and doesn&#x27;t require the student to study in any particular school or institution. The students are exposed to an intensive program that increases their understanding of other cultures, communities, and languages.

=== Long-term exchange ===

A long-term exchange is one which lasts six to ten months or up to one full year. Participants attend high school or university in their host countries, through a student visa. Typically, guest students coming to the United States are issued a J-1 cultural exchange visa or an F-1 foreign student visa. Students are expected to integrate themselves into the host family, immersing themselves in the local community and surroundings. Upon their return to their home country they are expected to incorporate this knowledge into their daily lives, as well as give a presentation on their experience to their sponsors. Many exchange programs expect students to be able converse in the language of the host country, at least on a basic level. Some programs require students to pass a standardized test for English language comprehension prior to being accepted into a program taking them to the United States. Other programs do not examine language ability. Most exchange students become fluent in the language of the host country within a few months. Some exchange programs, such as the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange, KL-YES, FLEX are government-funded programs.

The Council on Standards for International Educational Travel is a not-for-profit organization committed to quality international educational travel and exchange for youth at the high school level.

==Application process==
Long-term (10 to 12-month) exchange applications and interviews generally take place between a few days to few months depending on program type, host university requirements and destination country in advance of departure, Students generally must be between the ages of 13 and 18. Some programs allow students older than 18 years of age in a specialized work-study program.

Some programs require a preliminary application form with fees, and then schedule interviews and a longer application form. Other programs request a full application from the beginning and then schedule interviews. High school scholarship programs often require a set GPA of around 2.5 or higher. Programs select the candidates most likely to complete the program and serve as the best ambassadors to the foreign nation. Students in some programs, such as Rotary, are expected to go to any location where the organization places them, and students are encouraged not to have strict expectations of their host country. Students are allowed to choose a country, but may live at any spot within that country.

The home country organization will contact a partner organization in the country of the student&#x27;s choice. Students accepted for the program may or may not be screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to America may be allowed to come on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The US agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all US organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student&#x27;s well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.

== Costs ==
The costs of student exchange are determined by the charges from a student exchange program organisation or the university or college. The costs vary depending on the country, length of study and other personal factors. Different programs through the school/university of choice may offer students scholarships that cover the expenses of travel and accommodation and the personal needs of a student.

== Prevalence worldwide ==
Students study abroad from many countries around the globe. As of 2017, the top 8 countries sending students abroad for tertiary education are as follows:
===Australian context===

====Australian high school exchange programs====
Each state in Australia provides a different program of student exchange for secondary students. The programs from each state are different for whether a student in Australia is looking to study internationally or a student from another country is looking to study in Australia. Student exchange in Australia, depending on the state, might be managed by registered exchange organizations or the school chosen for study must be registered. The countries that are most popular for Australian students to choose to study are, Japan, France, Germany, USA, Italy, Canada, Belgium, Spain and Argentina. The main purpose of student exchange in Australia is to allow students to study, engage and experience a new culture. International students who choose to study in Australia are given different opportunities through the programs at set schools will learn about Australian culture, but also gain English language skills at a high school level.

====Australian university students exchange programs====
Exchange programs for university students to study abroad vary depending on the university campus offers. International student exchange programs for university students are aimed to enhance students&#x27; intercultural skills and knowledge. Student exchange programs for university students allow broadening their knowledge on their study of choice from a different country. This gives university students a chance to develop their work experience by seeing how their studying profession is practiced in another country. International exchange for tertiary students allows them to gain cultural experience in their studies and a chance to travel abroad while completing their degree.

=== Foreign students in Spain ===
A series of studies conducted within the last decade found similar results in students studying abroad in Spain for a short-term and/or semester long program. These studies found that students can improve their speaking proficiency during one semester, there is a positive relationship between students&#x27; integrative motivation and interaction with second language culture, and student contact with the Spanish language has a great effect on their speaking improvement. It is especially apparent in students who live with host families during their program. Anne Reynolds-Case found improvements in understanding and usage of the &quot;vosotros&quot; form after studying in Spain. One study specifically studies culture perceptions of students studying abroad in Spain. Alan Meredith defines culture as consisting &quot;of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiments in artifacts.&quot; Questionnaires were given to students living with host families during a two-month program in Spain. He studies how these groups perceive customs, such as concern for personal appearance, physical contact, cooking styles, politics, etc. The study found a variety of results depending the cultural custom. However, the US students&#x27; perceptions most closely aligned with the Young Spaniards (16–22 years old). At the same time, Angela George&#x27;s study found little significance in the adoption of regional features during their semester abroad. Though most of these studies focused on students who came from America to study in Spain, the United States is not the only one sending their students. Brian Denman&#x27;s article demonstrates an increase of Saudi student mobility for education, including locations such as Spain.

== Drawbacks ==
Even though exchange students learn to improve themselves through the experience of studying and staying in another country, there are also many difficulties. One of them is when exchange students are unable to adapt to pedagogy followed by the host country. Another is conflicts between the host family (who have provided accommodation) and the students, when it cannot be solved by communicating with each other and the student usually will be asked to stay with another host until they find a new match. This process, however, could take time while the students&#x27; duration of stay is limited. Even with preparation and knowledge about the new environment, they could still experience culture shock, which can affect them in different ways. Students from a different culture can also encounter homesickness for a longer period of time. Transport can also be a problem, as it is often difficult or impractical for a student to buy a car during a short program. Students will find it hard to find a job, even part-time since most exchange visas do not allow students to work and it is difficult to obtain one that does. Another potential drawback is ill-health that can occur during the stay in a foreign country. Students are advised to always have health insurance while traveling abroad, and carry emergency contact details of their local hosts and of family members as well. Students participating in student exchange programs have sometimes been vulnerable to threats such as terrorism and other crimes. For example, in 1998 a number of US students traveling in Guatemala on a college sponsored trip were attacked in the Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa area, with the entire group being robbed and physically harassed and threatened, and in the 1998 Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa attack five of the young women were raped.

<text>Manzanilla is a fortified wine similar to fino sherry made in the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in the province of Cádiz, Andalusia (Spain), and is produced under the Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) of Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda DOP. In Spanish, a chamomile infusion is called &quot;manzanilla&quot;—this wine gets its name because the wine&#x27;s aroma is said to be reminiscent of such an infusion.

Manzanilla is manufactured using the same methods as a fino sherry and results in a very pale, dry wine. It is often described as having a savoury and salty flavour, believed to develop from the chalky soil near the sea estuary of the Guadalquivir river. Sanlúcar de Barrameda&#x27;s cool temperatures and high humidity contribute to a higher yield of flor yeast than in Jerez or El Puerto de Santa María. The thicker cap of flor better protects the wine from contact with the air, resulting in a fresher, more delicate flavour than a fino from Jerez. It is typically aged for three to five years in a solera, but some types may be aged longer.

== Special types of Manzanilla ==
* &quot;Manzanilla Pasada&quot; is a Manzanilla aged longer than usual (approximately seven years), so that its veil of flor begins to fade, though not long enough to become an Amontillado.
* &quot;Manzanilla Amontillada&quot; is similar to a Manzanilla pasada but in some cases aged as long as 12 years, taking on more of the qualities of an Amontillado.
* &quot;Manzanilla Olorosa&quot; is a rich form of Manzanilla that takes on the quality of Oloroso through extended aging, sometimes as much as 30 years.
* Jerez Cortado is a &quot;Palo Cortado&quot; made from Manzanilla.

On 12 April 2012, the rules applicable to the sweet and fortified Denominations of Origen Montilla-Moriles and Jerez-Xérès-Sherry were changed.

The classification by sweetness is:

==Authorised grape varieties==
The authorised grape varieties are the same as those of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry DOP:

* White: Palomino, Pedro Ximénez, Moscatel de Grano Menudo, and Moscatel de Alejandría

== Serving ==

Manzanilla is best served chilled at . In Spain it is often served with olives, almonds, or other tapas such as Jamón serrano or seafood.

It is also popular in the cocktail Rebujito.

== Storing ==

Like fino, manzanilla is a delicate form of sherry and should be drunk within a year of bottling. Once opened it will immediately begin to deteriorate and should be drunk in one sitting for the best results. If necessary it can be stored, corked and refrigerated, for up to one week after opening.

== In popular culture ==

The 1875 French opera Carmen by Georges Bizet features a well-known aria, &#x27;Près des remparts de Séville&#x27;, in which the titular character, after being detained, seduces the guard assigned to her into freeing her by promising that they will visit her friend&#x27;s tavern where they will dance and drink manzanilla.

<text>Generation Adidas is a joint venture between Major League Soccer and U.S. Soccer aimed at raising the level of young professional soccer talent in the United States. The program, sponsored by Adidas, offers professional-ready players in the U.S. developmental system not yet eligible for the MLS SuperDraft early entry, allowing MLS to compete with foreign professional clubs without comparable restrictions on player signing. From its establishment in 1997 to 2005, the program was sponsored by Nike and was called &quot;Project-40&quot;. Originally intended to improve the U.S. national team player pool, American national team eligibility is no longer required for program entry.

Carlos Parra was the first Project-40 player when he signed with the league and was allocated to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in 1997. Since then, the program has included players such as Tim Howard, DaMarcus Beasley, Maurice Edu, Carlos Bocanegra, Clint Dempsey, Jozy Altidore, Ben Olsen, Sacha Kljestan, Freddy Adu, Brad Guzan, Michael Bradley, Nick Rimando, Kyle Beckerman, and NFL kicker Josh Lambo.

Generation Adidas players do not count against the MLS senior roster and usually earn a much higher salary than the league minimum. Entering into the program automatically classifies a player as professional, and thus disqualifies them from playing college soccer. As a result, Generation Adidas players are also guaranteed scholarships to continue their college education should they end their professional career early.

From 1998 to 2000, MLS entered a team of Project-40 players, supplemented by other MLS players who did not get much playing time, into the A-League in the USL.

In 2017, MLS introduced Canadian Generation Adidas players, part of a new initiative with the Canadian Soccer Association. Canadian Generation Adidas players count as domestic players on US based MLS teams.

<doc id="1076505" wikidata="Q3354732" url="?curid=1076505" title="Roman art">
<text>The art of Ancient Rome, and the territories of its Republic and later Empire, includes architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Luxury objects in metal-work, gem engraving, ivory carvings, and glass are sometimes considered to be minor forms of Roman art, although they were not considered as such at the time. Sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also highly regarded. A very large body of sculpture has survived from about the 1st century BC onward, though very little from before, but very little painting remains, and probably nothing that a contemporary would have considered to be of the highest quality.

Ancient Roman pottery was not a luxury product, but a vast production of &quot;fine wares&quot; in &quot;terra sigillata&quot; were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. Roman coins were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.

==Introduction==
While the traditional view of the ancient Roman artists is that they often borrowed from, and copied Greek precedents (much of the Greek sculptures known today are in the form of Roman marble copies), more of recent analysis has indicated that Roman art is a highly creative pastiche relying heavily on Greek models but also encompassing Etruscan, native Italic, and even Egyptian visual culture. Stylistic eclecticism and practical application are the hallmarks of much Roman art.

Pliny, Ancient Rome&#x27;s most important historian concerning the arts, recorded that nearly all the forms of art – sculpture, landscape, portrait painting, even genre painting – were advanced in Greek times, and in some cases, more advanced than in Rome. Though very little remains of Greek wall art and portraiture, certainly Greek sculpture and vase painting bears this out. These forms were not likely surpassed by Roman artists in fineness of design or execution. As another example of the lost &quot;Golden Age&quot;, he singled out Peiraikos, &quot;whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few ... He painted barbershops and shoemakers&#x27; stalls, donkeys, vegetables, and such, and for that reason came to be called the &#x27;painter of vulgar subjects&#x27;; yet these works are altogether delightful, and they were sold at higher prices than the greatest paintings of many other artists.&quot; The adjective &quot;vulgar&quot; is used here in its original definition, which means &quot;common&quot;.

The Greek antecedents of Roman art were legendary. In the mid-5th century BC, the most famous Greek artists were Polygnotos, noted for his wall murals, and Apollodoros, the originator of chiaroscuro. The development of realistic technique is credited to Zeuxis and Parrhasius, who according to ancient Greek legend, are said to have once competed in a bravura display of their talents, history&#x27;s earliest descriptions of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting. In sculpture, Skopas, Praxiteles, Phidias, and Lysippos were the foremost sculptors. It appears that Roman artists had much Ancient Greek art to copy from, as trade in art was brisk throughout the empire, and much of the Greek artistic heritage found its way into Roman art through books and teaching. Ancient Greek treatises on the arts are known to have existed in Roman times, though are now lost. Many Roman artists came from Greek colonies and provinces.

The high number of Roman copies of Greek art also speaks of the esteem Roman artists had for Greek art, and perhaps of its rarer and higher quality. Many of the art forms and methods used by the Romans – such as high and low relief, free-standing sculpture, bronze casting, vase art, mosaic, cameo, coin art, fine jewelry and metalwork, funerary sculpture, perspective drawing, caricature, genre and portrait painting, landscape painting, architectural sculpture, and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting – all were developed or refined by Ancient Greek artists. One exception is the Roman bust, which did not include the shoulders. The traditional head-and-shoulders bust may have been an Etruscan or early Roman form. Virtually every artistic technique and method used by Renaissance artists 1,900 years later had been demonstrated by Ancient Greek artists, with the notable exceptions of oil colors and mathematically accurate perspective. Where Greek artists were highly revered in their society, most Roman artists were anonymous and considered tradesmen. There is no recording, as in Ancient Greece, of the great masters of Roman art, and practically no signed works. Where Greeks worshipped the aesthetic qualities of great art, and wrote extensively on artistic theory, Roman art was more decorative and indicative of status and wealth, and apparently not the subject of scholars or philosophers.
Partly because Roman cities were mostly far larger than the Greek city-states in population, and generally less provincial, art in Ancient Rome took on a wider, and sometimes more utilitarian, purpose. Roman culture assimilated many cultures and was for the most part tolerant of the ways of conquered peoples. Roman art was commissioned, displayed, and owned in far greater quantities, and adapted to more uses than in Greek times. Wealthy Romans were more materialistic; they decorated their walls with art, their home with decorative objects, and themselves with fine jewelry.

In the Christian era of the late Empire, from 350 to 500 CE, wall painting, mosaic ceiling and floor work, and funerary sculpture thrived, while full-sized sculpture in the round and panel painting died out, most likely for religious reasons. When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium (renamed Constantinople), Roman art incorporated Eastern influences to produce the Byzantine style of the late empire. When Rome was sacked in the 5th century, artisans moved to and found work in the Eastern capital. The Church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople employed nearly 10,000 workmen and artisans, in a final burst of Roman art under Emperor Justinian (527–565 CE), who also ordered the creation of the famous mosaics of Basilica of San Vitale in the city of Ravenna.

==Painting==


Of the vast body of Roman painting we now have only a very few pockets of survivals, with many documented types not surviving at all, or doing so only from the very end of the period. 

The best known and most important pocket is the wall paintings from Pompeii, Herculaneum and other sites nearby, which show how residents of a wealthy seaside resort decorated their walls in the century or so before the fatal eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. A succession of dated styles have been defined and analysed by modern art historians beginning with August Mau, showing increasing elaboration.

Wall paintings of the same period have also been found from the remains of prominent aristocratic homes in Rome itself. Much of Nero&#x27;s palace in Rome, the Domus Aurea, built in the 60s AD, survived as grottos; their paintings inspired the grotesque style of painting popular during the Renaissance. We also have murals from houses identified with the emperor Augustus and his wife Livia, dating to beginning of the first century AD. The Casa della Farnesina is another prominent survival of the early Empire that gave up many paintings.

Outside of Italy, many fragments of painted walls have been found throughout the Empire, but few complete pieces. In the Western provinces of the Empire most fragments date from after the year 200 AD.

From Roman Egypt there are a large number of what are known as Fayum mummy portraits, bust portraits on wood added to the outside of mummies by a Romanized middle class; despite their very distinct local character they are probably broadly representative of Roman style in painted portraits, which are otherwise entirely lost.
Starting in the 3rd century AD and finishing by about 400 we have a large body of paintings from the Catacombs of Rome, by no means all Christian, showing the later continuation of the domestic decorative tradition in a version adapted - probably not greatly adapted - for use in burial chambers, in what was probably a rather humbler social milieu than the largest houses in Pompeii. 

Nothing remains of the Greek paintings imported to Rome during the 4th and 5th centuries, or of the painting on wood done in Italy during that period. In sum, the range of samples is confined to only about 200 years out of the about 900 years of Roman history, and of provincial and decorative paintings.

Most of this wall painting was done using the &quot;a secco&quot; (dry) method, but some fresco paintings also existed in Roman times. There is evidence from mosaics and a few inscriptions that some Roman paintings were adaptations or copies of earlier Greek works. However, adding to the confusion is the fact that inscriptions may be recording the names of immigrant Greek artists from Roman times, not from Ancient Greek originals that were copied. The Romans entirely lacked a tradition of figurative vase-painting comparable to that of the Ancient Greeks, which the Etruscans had emulated.

===Variety of subjects===

Roman painting provides a wide variety of themes: animals, still life, scenes from everyday life, portraits, and some mythological subjects. During the Hellenistic period, it evoked the pleasures of the countryside and represented scenes of shepherds, herds, rustic temples, rural mountainous landscapes and country houses. Erotic scenes are also relatively common. In the late empire, after 200AD, early Christian themes mixed with pagan imagery survive on catacomb walls.

===Landscape and vistas===

The main innovation of Roman painting compared to Greek art was the development of landscapes, in particular incorporating techniques of perspective, though true mathematical perspective developed 1,500 years later. Surface textures, shading, and coloration are well applied but scale and spatial depth was still not rendered accurately. Some landscapes were pure scenes of nature, particularly gardens with flowers and trees, while others were architectural vistas depicting urban buildings. Other landscapes show episodes from mythology, the most famous demonstrating scenes from the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

In the cultural point of view, the art of the ancient East would have known landscape painting only as the backdrop to civil or military narrative scenes. This theory is defended by Franz Wickhoff, is debatable. It is possible to see evidence of Greek knowledge of landscape portrayal in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Critias&quot; (107b–108b): ... and if we look at the portraiture of divine and of human bodies as executed by painters, in respect of the ease or difficulty with which they succeed in imitating their subjects in the opinion of onlookers, we shall notice in the first place that as regards the earth and mountains and rivers and woods and the whole of heaven, with the things that exist and move therein, we are content if a man is able to represent them with even a small degree of likeness ...

===Still life===
Roman still life subjects are often placed in illusionist niches or shelves and depict a variety of everyday objects including fruit, live and dead animals, seafood, and shells. Examples of the theme of the glass jar filled with water were skillfully painted and later served as models for the same subject often painted during the Renaissance and Baroque periods.

===Portraits===


Pliny complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, &quot;The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out ... Indolence has destroyed the arts.&quot;

In Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting, i.e. tempera or encaustic painting on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the Severan Tondo from , a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known Fayum mummy portraits, all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate that similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well.

===Gold glass===


Gold glass, or gold sandwich glass, was a technique for fixing a layer of gold leaf with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in Hellenistic glass and revived in the 3rd century AD. There are a very few large designs, including a very fine group of portraits from the 3rd century with added paint, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the Catacombs of Rome by pressing them into the mortar. They predominantly date from the 4th and 5th centuries. Most are Christian, though there are many pagan and a few Jewish examples. It is likely that they were originally given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year. Their iconography has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated. Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture. As time went on there was an increase in the depiction of saints. The same technique began to be used for gold tesserae for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

The earlier group are &quot;among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity&quot;, and represent the best surviving indications of what high quality Roman portraiture could achieve in paint. The Gennadios medallion in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Late Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local dialect features. He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition. One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an Early Medieval crux gemmata in Brescia, in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and Gothic queen Galla Placida and her children; in fact the knot in the central figure&#x27;s dress may mark a devotee of Isis. This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality. The inscription on the medallion is written in the Alexandrian dialect of Greek and hence most likely depicts a family from Roman Egypt. The medallion has also been compared to other works of contemporaneous Roman-Egyptian artwork, such as the Fayum mummy portraits. It is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using lenses. The later glasses from the catacombs have a level of portraiture that is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles.

===Genre scenes===
Roman genre scenes generally depict Romans at leisure and include gambling, music and sexual encounters. Some scenes depict gods and goddesses at leisure.

===Triumphal paintings===
From the 3rd century BC, a specific genre known as &quot;Triumphal Paintings&quot; appeared, as indicated by Pliny (XXXV, 22). These were paintings which showed triumphal entries after military victories, represented episodes from the war, and conquered regions and cities. Summary maps were drawn to highlight key points of the campaign.
Josephus describes the painting executed on the occasion of Vespasian and Titus&#x27;s sack of Jerusalem:
 There was also wrought gold and ivory fastened about them all; and many resemblances of the war, and those in several ways, and variety of contrivances, affording a most lively portraiture of itself. For there was to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were carried into captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown and ruined by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the walls of most populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and an army pouring itself within the walls; as also every place full of slaughter, and supplications of the enemies, when they were no longer able to lift up their hands in way of opposition. Fire also sent upon temples was here represented, and houses overthrown, and falling upon their owners: rivers also, after they came out of a large and melancholy desert, ran down, not into a land cultivated, nor as drink for men, or for cattle, but through a land still on fire upon every side; for the Jews related that such a thing they had undergone during this war. Now the workmanship of these representations was so magnificent and lively in the construction of the things, that it exhibited what had been done to such as did not see it, as if they had been there really present. On the top of every one of these pageants was placed the commander of the city that was taken, and the manner wherein he was taken.

These paintings have disappeared, but they likely influenced the composition of the historical reliefs carved on military sarcophagi, the Arch of Titus, and Trajan&#x27;s Column. This evidence underscores the significance of landscape painting, which sometimes tended towards being perspective plans.

Ranuccio also describes the oldest painting to be found in Rome, in a tomb on the Esquiline Hill:

This episode is difficult to pinpoint. One of Ranuccio&#x27;s hypotheses is that it refers to a victory of the consul Fabius Maximus Rullianus during the second war against Samnites in 326 BC. The presentation of the figures with sizes proportional to their importance is typically Roman, and finds itself in plebeian reliefs. This painting is in the infancy of triumphal painting, and would have been accomplished by the beginning of the 3rd century BC to decorate the tomb.

==Sculpture==

Early Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period. By the 2nd century BC, &quot;most of the sculptors working in Rome&quot; were Greek, often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BC), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.

A native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments of prosperous middle-class Romans, which very often featured portrait busts, and portraiture is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the Tomb of the Scipios or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous bronze head supposedly of Lucius Junius Brutus is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze. Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen in the coins of the consuls, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the basilicas of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even Londinium had a near-colossal statue of Nero, though far smaller than the 30-metre-high Colossus of Nero in Rome, now lost. The Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker, a successful freedman (c. 50-20 BC) has a frieze that is an unusually large example of the &quot;plebeian&quot; style. Imperial portraiture was initially Hellenized and highly idealized, as in the Blacas Cameo and other portraits of Augustus.
The Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in relief, culminating in the great Roman triumphal columns with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating Trajan (113 AD) and Marcus Aurelius (by 193) survive in Rome, where the Ara Pacis (&quot;Altar of Peace&quot;, 13 BC) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined, and the Sperlonga sculptures it at its most baroque. Some late Roman public sculptures developed a massive, simplified style that sometimes anticipates Soviet socialist realism. Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the Arch of Constantine and the base of the Column of Antoninus Pius (161), Campana reliefs were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus.

All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver Warren Cup, glass Lycurgus Cup, and large cameos like the Gemma Augustea, Gonzaga Cameo and the &quot;Great Cameo of France&quot;. For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of pottery vessels and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.

After moving through a late 2nd century &quot;baroque&quot; phase, in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace. The contrast is famously illustrated in the Arch of Constantine of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with roundels in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the &quot;Four Tetrarchs&quot; (c. 305) from the new capital of Constantinople, now in Venice. Ernst Kitzinger found in both monuments the same &quot;stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity – in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition&quot;.

This revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which Christianity was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors, as in the famous fragments of a colossal acrolithic statue of Constantine, and the 4th or 5th century Colossus of Barletta. However rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the consular diptych.

Traditional Roman sculpture is divided into five categories: portraiture, historical relief, funerary reliefs, sarcophagi, and copies of ancient Greek works. Contrary to the belief of early archaeologists, many of these sculptures were large polychrome terra-cotta images, such as the Apollo of Veii (Villa Givlia, Rome), but the painted surface of many of them has worn away with time.

===Narrative reliefs===
While Greek sculptors traditionally illustrated military exploits through the use of mythological allegory, the Romans used a more documentary style. Roman reliefs of battle scenes, like those on the Column of Trajan, were created for the glorification of Roman might, but also provide first-hand representation of military costumes and military equipment. Trajan&#x27;s column records the various Dacian wars conducted by Trajan in what is modern day Romania. It is the foremost example of Roman historical relief and one of the great artistic treasures of the ancient world. This unprecedented achievement, over 650 foot of spiraling length, presents not just realistically rendered individuals (over 2,500 of them), but landscapes, animals, ships, and other elements in a continuous visual history – in effect an ancient precursor of a documentary movie. It survived destruction when it was adapted as a base for Christian sculpture. During the Christian era after 300 AD, the decoration of door panels and sarcophagi continued but full-sized sculpture died out and did not appear to be an important element in early churches.

==Decorative arts==
===Pottery and terracottas===

The Romans inherited a tradition of art in a wide range of the so-called &quot;minor arts&quot; or decorative art. Most of these flourished most impressively at the luxury level, but large numbers of terracotta figurines, both religious and secular, continued to be produced cheaply, as well as some larger Campana reliefs in terracotta. Roman art did not use vase-painting in the way of the ancient Greeks, but vessels in Ancient Roman pottery were often stylishly decorated in moulded relief. Producers of the millions of small oil lamps sold seem to have relied on attractive decoration to beat competitors and every subject of Roman art except landscape and portraiture is found on them in miniature.

===Glass===
Luxury arts included fancy Roman glass in a great range of techniques, many smaller types of which were probably affordable to a good proportion of the Roman public. This was certainly not the case for the most extravagant types of glass, such as the cage cups or &quot;diatreta&quot;, of which the Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a near-unique figurative example in glass that changes colour when seen with light passing through it. The Augustan Portland Vase is the masterpiece of Roman cameo glass, and imitated the style of the large engraved gems (Blacas Cameo, Gemma Augustea, Great Cameo of France) and other hardstone carvings that were also most popular around this time.

===Mosaic===

Roman mosaic was a minor art, though often on a very large scale, until the very end of the period, when late-4th-century Christians began to use it for large religious images on walls in their new large churches; in earlier Roman art mosaic was mainly used for floors, curved ceilings, and inside and outside walls that were going to get wet. The famous copy of a Hellenistic painting in the &quot;Alexander Mosaic&quot; in Naples was originally placed in a floor in Pompeii; this is much higher quality work than most Roman mosaic, though very fine panels, often of still life subjects in small or micromosaic tesserae have also survived. The Romans distinguished between normal &quot;opus tessellatum&quot; with &quot;tesserae&quot; mostly over 4 mm across, which was laid down on site, and finer &quot;opus vermiculatum&quot; for small panels, which is thought to have been produced offsite in a workshop, and brought to the site as a finished panel. The latter was a Hellenistic genre which is found in Italy between about 100 BC and 100 AD. Most signed mosaics have Greek names, suggesting the artists remained mostly Greek, though probably often slaves trained up in workshops. The late 2nd century BC Nile mosaic of Palestrina is a very large example of the popular genre of Nilotic landscape, while the 4th century Gladiator Mosaic in Rome shows several large figures in combat. Orpheus mosaics, often very large, were another favourite subject for villas, with several ferocious animals tamed by Orpheus&#x27;s playing music. In the transition to Byzantine art, hunting scenes tended to take over large animal scenes.

===Metalwork===
Metalwork was highly developed, and clearly an essential part of the homes of the rich, who dined off silver, while often drinking from glass, and had elaborate cast fittings on their furniture, jewellery, and small figurines. A number of important hoards found in the last 200 years, mostly from the more violent edges of the late empire, have given us a much clearer idea of Roman silver plate. The Mildenhall Treasure and Hoxne Hoard are both from East Anglia in England. There are few survivals of upmarket ancient Roman furniture, but these show refined and elegant design and execution.

===Coins and medals===
Few Roman coins reach the artistic peaks of the best Greek coins, but they survive in vast numbers and their iconography and inscriptions form a crucial source for the study of Roman history, and the development of imperial iconography, as well as containing many fine examples of portraiture. They penetrated to the rural population of the whole Empire and beyond, with barbarians on the fringes of the Empire making their own copies. In the Empire medallions in precious metals began to be produced in small editions as imperial gifts, which are similar to coins, though larger and usually finer in execution. Images in coins initially followed Greek styles, with gods and symbols, but in the death throes of the Republic first Pompey and then Julius Caesar appeared on coins, and portraits of the emperor or members of his family became standard on imperial coinage. The inscriptions were used for propaganda, and in the later Empire the army joined the emperor as the beneficiary.

==Architecture==
It was in the area of architecture that Roman art produced its greatest innovations. Because the Roman Empire extended over so great of an area and included so many urbanized areas, Roman engineers developed methods for citybuilding on a grand scale, including the use of concrete. Massive buildings like the Pantheon and the Colosseum could never have been constructed with previous materials and methods. Though concrete had been invented a thousand years earlier in the Near East, the Romans extended its use from fortifications to their most impressive buildings and monuments, capitalizing on the material&#x27;s strength and low cost. The concrete core was covered with a plaster, brick, stone, or marble veneer, and decorative polychrome and gold-gilded sculpture was often added to produce a dazzling effect of power and wealth.

Because of these methods, Roman architecture is legendary for the durability of its construction; with many buildings still standing, and some still in use, mostly buildings converted to churches during the Christian era. Many ruins, however, have been stripped of their marble veneer and are left with their concrete core exposed, thus appearing somewhat reduced in size and grandeur from their original appearance, such as with the Basilica of Constantine.

During the Republican era, Roman architecture combined Greek and Etruscan elements, and produced innovations such as the round temple and the curved arch. As Roman power grew in the early empire, the first emperors inaugurated wholesale leveling of slums to build grand palaces on the Palatine Hill and nearby areas, which required advances in engineering methods and large scale design. Roman buildings were then built in the commercial, political, and social grouping known as a forum, that of Julius Caesar being the first and several added later, with the Forum Romanum being the most famous. The greatest arena in the Roman world, the Colosseum, was completed around 80 AD at the far end of that forum. It held over 50,000 spectators, had retractable fabric coverings for shade, and could stage massive spectacles including huge gladiatorial contests and mock naval battles. This masterpiece of Roman architecture epitomizes Roman engineering efficiency and incorporates all three architectural orders – Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Less celebrated but just as important if not more so for most Roman citizens, was the five-story &quot;insula&quot; or city block, the Roman equivalent of an apartment building, which housed tens of thousands of Romans.
It was during the reign of Trajan (98–117 AD) and Hadrian (117–138 AD) that the Roman Empire reached its greatest extent and that Rome itself was at the peak of its artistic glory – achieved through massive building programs of monuments, meeting houses, gardens, aqueducts, baths, palaces, pavilions, sarcophagi, and temples. The Roman use of the arch, the use of concrete building methods, the use of the dome all permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled the building of these public spaces and complexes, including the palaces, public baths and basilicas of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the empire. Outstanding examples of dome construction include the Pantheon, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Baths of Caracalla. The Pantheon (dedicated to all the planetary gods) is the best preserved temple of ancient times with an intact ceiling featuring an open &quot;eye&quot; in the center. The height of the ceiling exactly equals the interior radius of the building, creating a hemispherical enclosure. These grand buildings later served as inspirational models for architects of the Italian Renaissance, such as Brunelleschi. By the age of Constantine (306–337 AD), the last great building programs in Rome took place, including the erection of the Arch of Constantine built near the Colosseum, which recycled some stone work from the forum nearby, to produce an eclectic mix of styles.

Roman aqueducts, also based on the arch, were commonplace in the empire and essential transporters of water to large urban areas. Their standing masonry remains are especially impressive, such as the Pont du Gard (featuring three tiers of arches) and the aqueduct of Segovia, serving as mute testimony to their quality of their design and construction.

He graduated from Eötvös Loránd University with a degree in Mathematics in 1974. He spent the next ten years at the Computer and Automation Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, working on various pattern recognition and artificial intelligence projects. Recognizing the limitations of artificial intelligence, he began investigating human cognition. Since 1984 he has been at the Experimental Psychology Department of Eötvös Loránd University, studying cognitive psychology and psychophysics. 

He has written two books, &quot;Ways of Thinking&quot; (newer translation: &quot;Habits of Mind&quot;) and &quot;Moral Calculations&quot;, that aroused the interest of the wider, non-professional public. His books analyze the quasi-rational mechanisms of people and the nature of rationality in general, undermining some common beliefs about our minds&#x27; functioning.

He has been publishing in Magyar Narancs a series titled &quot;Are you the dance instructor here?&quot; (The title refers to a joke: A client enters the dancing school and asks a well-dressed man: &quot;Are you the dance instructor here?&quot; &quot;Fuck no, I&#x27;m the etiquette instructor!&quot;) Several of these essays were collected in a book in 2005 (see below).
==Volumes published in English==

<text>Pamphill is a village in south-east Dorset, England, just outside Wimborne Minster, four miles north of Poole. The village has a population of 704 (2001).

==Church of St Stephen==

In its current form, the Parish church of St Stephen dates from 1908, when it was designed by the architect Charles Ponting to serve the Bankes family of Dorset as their place of worship. The village of Pamphill was in their estate at this time.

==Pamphill First School==

First built in 1695, the school was only the central part of the building, meaning a very low capacity, with adjoining almshouses on either side. It was built through the will of Roger Gillingham of the Middle Temple, who left property in Bedfordshire, Hackney and Stepney to trustees, in assurance that they would raise £400 for a close next to Pamphill Green. It has continued over the years with the almshouses becoming classrooms and, closer to now, building work to make more room. An inscription on the outside of the school reads:

To God &amp; ye poor
The pious &amp; charitable gift of
ROGER GILLINGHAM
of the Middle Temple, London, Esq.
This free writing school &amp; ye almshouse adjoining
Were built by ALDRICH SWAN clerk &amp; Rector 
of Kington Magna in this county &amp; one of the
Ministers of the parish &amp; Pursuant to the Gift
of Trust of the said Roger Gillingham
Ao Doi 1698

==The Vine Inn==

The Vine Inn is a public house at Vine Hill, that is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. It was a bakery until about 1900, when it was refitted as a pub. It is owned by the National Trust.

<text>John O&#x27;Brien (May 21, 1960 – April 10, 1994) was an American author, known for his debut novel &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;.

==Life and career==
O&#x27;Brien was born in Oxford, Ohio, where his parents, Bill and Judy O&#x27;Brien, were both students at Miami University. He was the brother of writer Erin O&#x27;Brien. John grew up in Brecksville and Lakewood, Ohio, and graduated from Lakewood High School in 1978. 

Through a friend of his ex-wife, O&#x27;Brien got a gig writing Episode 37 of the animated series &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, which premiered in 1992 under his only known pseudonym, Carroll Mine. According to his sister, Erin, he was disgusted with editorial changes made to his script.

His first novel, &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, was published in 1990 by Watermark Press and made into a film of the same name in 1995.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Brien married Lisa Kirkwood in 1979, and the couple moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1982. They divorced in 1992, at his initiative. His first novel, &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, is dedicated to her.

He was a fan of singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks and admired &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;.

O&#x27;Brien suffered from alcoholism and had been &quot;in and out of rehab for years&quot; before his death.

==Death==
O&#x27;Brien died from suicide (self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head) at his Beverly Hills apartment on April 10, 1994, two weeks after signing away the rights to adapt his novel, &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;. His father and book critics said that the novel was his suicide note, while his sister, Erin O&#x27;Brien, thought the book was &quot;the beautiful poetic way to check out: Taking that long slug of liquor and gurgling into his death with this beautiful woman.&quot;

Two more of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novels were published posthumously: &quot;Stripper Lessons&quot; (Grove Press, 1997) and &quot;The Assault on Tony&#x27;s&quot; (Grove Press, 1996), both of which had been left unfinished at the time of his death and were completed by his sister, Erin. A short story &quot;The Tik&quot; was published in the 2007 Vegas anthology &quot;Las Vegas Noir&quot;, and a third manuscript, &quot;Better&quot;, was published by Akashic Press in 2009.

<doc id="1076522" wikidata="Q463451" url="?curid=1076522" title="Flor">
<text>Flor (Spanish and Portuguese for &quot;flower&quot;) in winemaking, is a film of yeast on the surface of wine, important in the manufacture of some styles of sherry. The flor is formed naturally under certain winemaking conditions, from indigenous yeasts found in the region of Andalucía in southern Spain. Normally in winemaking, it is essential to keep young wines away from exposure to air by sealing them in airtight barrels, to avoid contamination by bacteria and yeasts that tend to spoil it. However, in the manufacture of sherries, the slightly porous oak barrels are deliberately filled only about five-sixths full with the young wine, leaving &quot;the space of two fists&quot; empty to allow the flor yeast to take form and the bung is not completely sealed. The flor favors cooler climates and higher humidity, so the sherries produced in the coastal Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María have a thicker cap of flor than those produced inland in Jerez. The yeast gives the resulting sherry its distinctive fresh taste, with residual flavors of fresh bread. Depending on the development of the wine, it may be aged entirely under the veil of flor to produce a fino or manzanilla sherry, or it may be fortified to limit the growth of flor and undergo oxidative aging to produce an amontillado or oloroso sherry.

During the fermentation phase of sherry production, the flor yeast works anaerobically, converting sugar into ethanol. When all the sugar has been consumed, the physiology of the yeast changes to where it begins an aerobic process of breaking down and converting the acids into other compounds such as acetaldehyde. A waxy coating appears on the cells&#x27; exterior, causing the yeast to float to the surface and form a protective &quot;blanket&quot; thick enough to shield the wine from oxygen. This process drastically lowers the acidity of the wine and makes sherry one of the most aldehydic wines in the world. Studies have shown that for the flor to thrive, the wine must stay in a narrow alcohol range of 14.5% to 16% ABV. Below 14.5% the yeast will not form its protective cap, and so the wine will oxidize to the point of becoming vinegar. Above 16% the flor cannot survive, and so the wine essentially becomes an oloroso.

==Other regions==
A film of yeast similar to flor is also used in the production of vin jaune in the Jura wine region in eastern France. The French term used for this yeast film is &quot;voile&quot;, meaning &quot;veil&quot;.

A similar yeast to flor is used in the production of &quot;Szamorodni szaraz&quot; in the Tokaj wine region in northeastern Hungary and southeastern Slovakia. The Hungarian name for this yeast is &quot;hártya&quot; which means &quot;film&quot;.

Natural yeast film was traditionally used in Gose beer to seal bottles, instead of caps or corks.

Flor is also present in Vernaccia di Oristano D.O.C. a wine from the italian region of Sardinia and Malvasia di Bosa.

<text>La Massana (; originally &quot;La Maçana&quot;) is one of the seven parishes of the Principality of Andorra. It is located in the northwest of the country. La Massana is also the name of the main town of the parish. The name Massana derives from the Latin name &quot;mattianam&quot; for a variety of apple. Other settlements in the parish are Pal, Arinsal, Erts, Sispony, Anyós, L&#x27;Aldosa de la Massana, Puiol del Pui, Escàs, Els Plans, Mas de Ribafeta, Xixerella and Pui.

The parish is extremely mountainous and contains the highest mountain in Andorra, Coma Pedrosa (). Its western side limits with Tor, Pallars municipal term, in the border with Spain.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
The parish has an area of , and adjoins the neighbouring parishes of Ordino, Encamp, Escaldes-Engordany, and Andorra la Vella, and also France (Occitanie) and Spain (Catalonia). There is of agricultural land, 14% of the total agricultural land in Andorra.

The main villages are &quot;La Massana&quot; (the capital city itself), Pal, Arinsal, Anyós, Erts, Sispony, L&#x27;Aldosa, and Escàs. Other settlements are Xixerella, Mas de Ribafeta, El Pui, and Puiol del Piu.

Coma Pedrosa in the north-west of the parish is the highest point in the Principality of Andorra at , and has panoramic views of the Pyrenees. The mountain is also the site of the Coma Pedrosa Nature Reserve. It is covered by heavy snowfalls in winter, and usually retains some snow cover in summer. The four next-highest peaks are Medacorba (2914 m), Sanfonts (2888 m), Pla de l&#x27;Estany (2859 m), and Racofred (2837 m). The town of La Massana has an average elevation of above sea-level. There are four lakes: Forcats, Montmantell, Estany Negre, and Les Truites Lake.

The parish has three main rivers. The Valira del Nord, which begins at the Llac de Tristaina, is a long tributary of the Gran Valira. There are also the Pal and the Montaner.

The mountains have rough pastures with numerous native species of Pyrenean wildflowers, and extensive forests of pines, firs, birches, wild cherries, and oaks.

===Climate===
The average annual temperature of La Massana town is . Across the whole parish, the climate varies greatly with elevation. Regions above the Alpine tree line at about 2100–2400 m have an alpine climate and alpine tundra. The valleys have a milder climate that is essentially temperate.

==Economy==

===Tourism===
The main industry is tourism and the parish is a major tourism destination. In winter, the main activities are skiing, snowboarding, and ski biking. The main ski resort, Vallnord, includes the Arinsal and Pal sectors, which jointly have 89 km of runs ranging in altitude from 2600 m to 1550 m. In summer, the main activities are hiking, climbing, mountain biking, 4x4 trails, and canyoning.
===Agriculture===
Agricultural land amounting to 262 ha is used for growing tobacco, vegetables (mainly potatoes), and cereals. There are rough pastures on the higher slopes which are used for raising dairy cattle and also for keeping horses used in trekking holidays.

===Construction and real estate===
The construction industry and real estate have also been significant sectors of the economy.

==Sights and culture==
There are two museums: Casa Rull Ethnographic Museum in Sispony, and Farga Rossell, a forge built in the mid-19th century which has demonstrations of iron working.

The parish is host to a number of fiestas and other public celebrations. There are the &quot;festa patronale&quot; on 17 November, the &quot;festa major&quot; on 15 August, and the Rosary fete on the second Sunday of July. A fiesta is also held at the end of June or beginning of July, depending on the weather, to mark the consecration of the livestock and pastures.

==Transport==
The transport infrastructure consists of roads, road tunnels, gondola lifts, and two heliports. There are no railways, ports, airports, or navigable waterways.

===Buses===
There are regular bus services throughout the rural and metropolitan areas of the parish. There are services to most destinations inside Andorra and several long-distance services to destinations outside Andorra such as Barcelona and Toulouse.

===Road infrastructure===
The parish is linked to the neighbouring parish of Ordino by the CG-3 main road, and to the capital, Andorra La Vella, by the CG-3/CG-4 main road.

There are two road tunnels along the route of the CG-3/CG-4: the Pont Pla Tunnel, a long tunnel built in 2006, and the Sant Antoni Tunnel, a long tunnel built in 2003. The Pont Pla Tunnel has been designated the best and safest tunnel in Europe by the European Tunnels Assessment Programme (EuroTAP).

The parish&#x27;s road network is being upgraded in a multimillion-euro programme involving new tunnel construction, road widening, improved sign-posting, new bicycle lanes, and additional safety measures such as crash barriers and signal-controlled pedestrian crossings.

The Dos Valires Tunnel, a road tunnel between Anyós and Encamp, was completed in 2012, cutting the expected journey times from the current 30–45 minutes to 5 minutes.

===Heliports===
There are two heliports in the area — one in La Massana town (the Heliport Terra Guindaldes) and one in Arinsal, both providing commercial helicopter services. In addition, there is a heliport in the capital, Andorra la Vella Heliport. There are no scheduled passenger flights to these heliports, but it is possible to book taxi flights from Barcelona, Lleida, Perpignan, or Toulouse airports for fixed prices. There is no airport in Andorra. The nearest one is Andorra–La Seu d&#x27;Urgell Airport in Spain around 12 km from the border.

===Gondola lifts===
There is a gondola lift linking the town of La Massana to Vallnord (Pal-Arinsal sector ski station); it runs throughout the year. There are further gondola lifts within the ski resorts themselves.

<text>Edward Frederick Sorin, C.S.C. (French: Édouard Sorin; February 6, 1814October 31, 1893) was a French-born priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross and the founder of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and of St. Edward&#x27;s University in Austin, Texas.

==Early life==
Edouard Frédéric Sorin was born on February 6, 1814, at in Ahuillé, near Laval, France, to Julian Sorin de la Gaulterie and Marie Anne Louise Gresland de la Margalerie. He was the seventh of nine children, and he was born into a well-off middle-class family and grew up in a three-story manor home (the &quot;chateau de la Roche&quot;) with seven acres of land. His family was religious and had sheltered two non-juring priests during the persecutions of the French Revolution. He received an early education in the home, in the local village school, and by the local parish priest. He then enrolled in the School of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Laval, but after one year he decided to become a priest and with his family&#x27;s backing enrolled at the diocesan seminary in Precigné. Here he completed his humanities course and then enrolled at the major seminary in Le Mans for theology. Among his fellow students were the future cardinals Benoît-Marie Langénieux and Guillame Meignan. Here he made the acquaintance of Basil Moreau, who was vice rector and professor of scripture. He also became interested in missionary work after listening to the pleads of Simon Bruté, bishop of Vicennes in Indiana, who had returned to France to recruit missionaries.

Completing his seminary studies, he was ordained a priest on May 27, 1838, and was assigned as parish priest in Parcé-sur-Sarthe. He remained in this position for about fourteen month, but then desired to join Basil Moreau&#x27;s novel organization, the Congregation of Holy Cross (born out of the merger of Moreau&#x27;s auxiliary priests and Jacques-Francois Dujarié&#x27;s Brothers of Saint Joseph). With the bishop&#x27;s permission, he joined the group and underwent a brief novitiate. On August 15, 1840, Sorin - together with Basil Moreau and three other priests - were the first members of the Congregation of Holy Cross to take solemn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

===Missionary to America===
Simon Bruté, who Sorin has witnessed recruiting priests and missionaries for his recently established diocese in Vincennes in Indiana, died in 1839. His successor Célestin Guynemer de la Hailandière renewed the call for help, and Moreau decided to send assistance. Because of Sorin&#x27;s leadership abilities, motivation, and youthful vigor, Moreau chose him to lead this missionary expedition. Missionary enterprise in foreign lands, including distant lands such as China, Japan or America, motivated French clergy and inspired numerous vocations. Sorin was accompanied by six brothers of the Congregation: Brothers Vincent (born John Pieau), Joachim (William Michael André), Lawrence (John Menage), Francis Xavier (René Patois), Anselm (Pierre Caillot), and Gratian (Urban Mosimer).

== Founding of the University of Notre Dame ==

=== Journey to America and time in St Peter&#x27;s ===
Accompanied by the six brothers, Sorin left Le Mans on August 5, 1841, and left Le Havre on board the ship &quot;Iowa&quot;. They arrived in New York City on September 13, and one of Sorin&#x27;s first acts upon arrival to America was to kneel down and kiss the ground, as a sign of adoption of his new country. They spent three days in the city hosted by Samuel Byerley, a rich trader and convert to Catholicism, and met with New York&#x27;s bishop John Dubois. On September 16 they went up the Hudson River by paddleboat to Albany and then reached Buffalo via the Erie Canal, with a short detour to view Niagara falls. They crossed Lake Erie on steamboat and reached Toledo, from where they went down to Maumee river to Maumee, then Napoleon, Defiance, Fort Wayne, Lafayette, Terre Haute, and following the Wabash river they finally reached Vincennes on October 10.

Bishop Célestine Hailandière welcomed the congregation and first offered them property and ministry in Francesville, but Sorin declined. He accepted the bishop&#x27;s second offer of establishing themselves in the parish of St. Peter in Montgomery. The mission already had a few buildings, a small wooden chapel, and a primitive school with a few pupils. The school was soon headed by Charles Rother, a German immigrant who soon desired to join the congregation and became the first to do so in the United States, with the name of Brother Joseph. Other brothers soon joined, mostly Irish and German immigrants, although many left. The start of the mission saw some hardships, particularly in adopting foreign agricultural practices and the cultivation of corn, but they adapted with help from the locals. Sorin celebrated Mass and gave spiritual assistance to around thirty-five Catholic families in the area, preaching in French and sometimes English, a language Sorin was only beginning to learn.

Soon, more problems developed in the community. Sorin and bishop Hailandière had disagreements over financial matters, since Sorin expected the bishop to provide 3,000 francs for their expenses. The bishop, who had expected them in 1839, had already employed the money elsewhere. Despite this, the bishop agreed to pay for the community, but on the condition they would report to him instead of being under the jurisdiction of Moreau, a condition which Sorin refused. This disagreement was partially diffused by Father Juliane Delaune, who was able to solicit funds and donations amounting to 15,000 francs, which he divided between Sorin and the bishop. A second and deeper misunderstanding arose when Sorin made his intentions to start a collège (a college-high school on the French model). The bishop rejected this idea, since there already was a Catholic college in Vincennes, St Gabriel&#x27;s, which was staffed by the Eudists fathers. The bishop had promised them he would have no competition for funds and students. Instead, the bishop mentioned that he owned land in northern Indiana, close to South Bend, and Sorin could start his college there instead. This land had been purchased by Stephen Badin in the 1830s with the intent of building a school, but after his plans had failed he offered it to the bishop. Sorin consulted with the brothers and then accepted, departing St. Peter&#x27;s with seven of the brothers on November 16.

=== Founding of Notre Dame ===
Sorin and his seven brothers (three French and four Irish) traveled 250 miles north in one of Indiana&#x27;s harshest winters. They followed the Wabash River, passing by Terre Haute. They split, and Sorin with the first group arrived in South Bend on the afternoon of November 26, 1842. Here they were welcomed by Alexis Coquillard (who bishop Hailandière had put them in contact with) and then undertook the two-mile trip to visit the property before spending the night guests of Coquillard. The next day they visited the site with day-light, and took formal possession of the property. Sorin described his arrival on campus in a letter to Basil Moreau:At the time, the property only had three buildings: a log cabin built by Stephen Badin (the original burned down in 1856 but a replica was built in 1906), a small two-story clapboard building that was the home of the Potawatomi interpreter Charon, and a small shed. Of the 524 acres, only 10 were cleared and ready for cultivation, but Sorin stated that the soil was suitable for raising wheat and corn. While the land had two small lakes, the snow and marshy area might have given to Sorin the appearance of a single larger lake, hence why named the fledgling mission &quot;Notre Dame du Lac&quot; (Our Lady of the Lake). The most immediate concern were suitable and warm lodgings for the Sorin and the seven brothers present and for those in St. Peter&#x27;s who were yet to come north. To build a second log cabin, and lacking the funds, they appealed to the people of South Bend to donate funds or their time. Thanks to the help from the locals, they were able to assemble the timber and erect the walls, and the Sorin and the brothers erected the roof when the men returned to town. The cabin was completed on March 19, 1843, in time to accommodate the additional brothers and novices who has arrived from St. Peter&#x27;s the month before.

Next, Sorin dedicated himself to building a college proper, since the foundation of such within two years was the condition on which he had been given the land by bishop Hailandière. While in Vincennes, Sorin had made plans with a local architect, Jean-Marie Marsile, to have him come to South Bend in the summer and start construction of a main building, but the architect did not show up. Hence, he and the brothers constructed Old College, a two-story brick building that served as dormitory, bakery, and classrooms. With the Old College building ready by the fall, the college officially opened to its first few students. The first residents to receive an education at Notre Dame were orphans from a home established by the Brothers of Saint Joseph to educate children beyond the ages of 12 and 13. When Marsile finally arrived in August, Sorin proceeded to erect the first Main Building (at the location of the third and present Main Building). The building, completed in 1844 and enlarged in 1853, constituted the entire college until the construction of the second and larger Main Building in 1865.

Following Moreau&#x27;s example, Sorin sent out priests and brothers to found other schools and parishes throughout the United States and Canada. On January 15, 1844, the Indiana legislature officially chartered the University of Notre Dame.

From the French seminary system, Sorin was by temperament more of an administrator than an academic or intellectual. He ran Notre Dame on the model of a French boarding school, which included elementary (the &quot;minims&quot;), preparatory, and collegiate programs, as well as a manual training school. Over the years, he accepted the recommendations of others, including John A. Zahm, to strengthen Notre Dame&#x27;s academic curriculum.

In 1850 Sorin asked the federal government to establish a post office at Notre Dame. His request was granted, and in 1851 First Assistant Postmaster General Fitz Henry Warren notified congressman Graham N. Fitch of the establishment of the Notre Dame post office and the appointment of Edward Sorin as its postmaster. While the income from the post office was negligible, its major advantage was to increase the visibility of Notre Dame and incentivize better roads and communications to the campus.

In 1865 he became the first American Provincial Superior of the Congregation and was succeeded as president by Patrick Dillon. As provincial superior, he was still actively involved with the running of the university and resided on campus.

=== Provincial Superior of the Congregation ===
Far from Indiana to India, the flourishing mission in Eastern Bengal, headed by the Congregation of Holy Cross, owes much of its success to Father Sorin&#x27;s active co-operation and zeal. He sent its former bishop and other priests together with a band of sisters, described as a worthy group. The founding of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in the United States is regarded as one of Sorin&#x27;s most important services to religion. Under his administration and care, this community grew from small to possessing flourishing establishments in a dozen states. During the American Civil War, under Sorin&#x27;s forethought, this sisterhood was able to furnish nearly eighty nurses for sick and wounded soldiers on transports and in hospitals. A number of priests of the Congregation of Holy Cross, among them William Corby, served as chaplains at the front. Sorin also established Ave Maria Press in 1865.

==== 1879 fire of the Main Building ====
Sorin&#x27;s strength was demonstrated on April 23, 1879, when a fire destroyed the Main Building, which housed virtually the entire university. Following the pledge made by the university&#x27;s president, William Corby, C.S.C., Notre Dame reopened for the fall term. Sorin also willed Notre Dame to rebuild and continue its growth. As recounted in Notre Dame: 100 Years (1942):&quot;The sixty-five year old man walked around the ruins, and those who followed him were confounded by his attitude. Instead of bending, he stiffened. There was on his face a look of grim determination. He signaled all of them to go into the church with him.&quot;
Timothy Edward Howard provided a first-person account of what Sorin said inside Sacred Heart Church: &quot;I was then present when Father Sorin, after looking over the destruction of his life-work, stood at the altar steps of the only building left and spoke to the community what I have always felt to be the most sublime words I ever listened to. There was absolute faith, confidence, resolution in his very look and pose. &#x27;If it were ALL gone, I should not give up!&#x27; were his words in closing. The effect was electric. It was the crowning moment of his life. A sad company had gone into the church that day. They were all simple Christian heroes as they came out. There was never more a shadow of a doubt as to the future of Notre Dame.&quot;An alternative version of Sorin&#x27;s post-fire address has increased in popularity. It argues that Our Lady (the Virgin Mary) burned down the Main Building because he built it too small, and that he would now rebuild it &quot;bigger and better than ever&quot;. This version seems apocryphal as it was not included in any contemporaneous accounts of the event or in Sorin&#x27;s own writings. Sorin believed a divine hand was involved in the fire&#x27;s origins, but ascribed it directly to God, whom Sorin suspected of being angry over &quot;infidelity&quot; and &quot;neglect,&quot; not the dimensions of the building.
Sorin had an ambitious goal for the new Administration Building, constructed over the summer of 1879. He wanted it to be nothing less than a &quot;monument to Catholicism.&quot; Having stood for some 135 years, the Administration Building with its Golden Dome served as a monument. Catholicism generally and millions of working-class first- and second-generation American Catholics were inspired to see their sons (and eventually daughters) pursue higher education. It allowed them to gain entry into the mainstream of American social, economic, and political life.

== Superior General ==
Sorin was elected superior-general of his order in 1868, and held this office for the rest of his life. During his tenure as Superior General, Sorin made around 50 voyages across the Atlantic to deal with the affairs of the Congregation in France and Rome. In order to ease the debt of the Congregation and put on more solid financial footing, he oversaw the sale of the church of Notre Dame de Sainte Croix, its boarding school, and the rest of the Congregation property in Le Mans, which until then had served as the order&#x27;s headquarters. Hence the headquarters was moved to Notre Dame, Indiana. Sorin was invited to attend the Provincial Council of Cincinnati of 1882 and the Plenary Council of American Bishops at Baltimore in 1884.

=== Founding of St. Edward&#x27;s University ===
Sorin also founded St. Edward&#x27;s University in Austin, Texas. Bishop Claude Marie Dubuis of the Diocese of Galveston learned of Mrs. Mary Doyle&#x27;s intention to leave her large South Austin farm to the Catholic Church. The purpose was to establish an &quot;education institution&quot; and he invited Father Sorin to Texas in 1872. Answering the bishop&#x27;s invitation, Sorin traveled to Austin and surveyed the beauty of the surrounding hills and lakes. A year later, following Mrs. Doyle&#x27;s death, he founded a Catholic school called St. Edward&#x27;s Academy in honor of his patron saint, Edward the Confessor and King. In the fledgling institution&#x27;s first year, 1878, three farm boys made up the student body and met for classes in a makeshift building on the old Doyle homestead. In 1885, the academy secured its charter as a college. Sorin Hall and nearby Sorin Oak — the largest oak tree in Austin — are also named after him.

== Personal life ==
While Sorin was attached to his French roots, he had a deep desire to be an American and his attachment to his new country manifested in several ways. Notre Dame&#x27;s first end of year celebration in 1845 was opened by a reading of the Declaration of Independence. He became an American citizen in 1850, and was soon after that named to the government positions of local postmaster and superintendent of the roads. One of the earliest buildings on the Notre Dame campus, Washington Hall, was named after the first U.S. president rather than a Catholic saint. During the Civil War, he allowed several priests and eighty sisters of the community to volunteer as chaplains and nurses, despite their absence affecting the university. His thorough &quot;Americanism&quot; and his &quot;American patriotism and [his] love of American institutions&quot; were praised by John Ireland.

In recognition of his work in education, the French Government conferred upon him the insignia of Officer of Public Instruction in 1888.

==Final years==

A Golden Jubilee in 1888 marked the fiftieth anniversary of Sorin&#x27;s priestly ordination, which had taken place in 1838. One first celebration occurred during the school year, with the students present, on the actual anniversary of the ordination. On May 26 all campus building were decorated with flags and banners. The entertainment consisted in a reception with students, faculty, and administration, followed by speeches, poems, recitals, and musical performances. After dinner, Sorin and the faculty members gathered on the Main Building porch and watched the Notre Dame Band perform in the quad and the student military units give their gun salutes. The student, faculty and alumni gifted Sorin with a barouche drawn by two black horses. The night was marked by fireworks, paper lanterns, and further celebrations. On May 27, the anniversary of the ordination, Sorin celebrated a Solemn High Mass with William Corby delivering the sermon. Afterwards, Sorin blessed the cornerstone of a new residence hall, which Sorin discovered was to be named Sorin Hall in his honor. This was followed by further celebrations, while baseball games and boat races were deferred to the next day due to rain.

While this first celebration was reserved for the campus community, second one, of a more official and public nature, was held a few month later on August 15, 1888. General invitations in newspapers across the country via the Associated Press. Thousands of people came to Notre Dame for the event, and many more sent their congratulation to Sorin by letters and telegrams. The most high-profile attendee was Cardinal James Gibbons, then the most significant prelate in the American Catholic Church. A huge crowd gathered at the train station in South Bend to witness his arrival on August 14. William Corby took Gibbons in Sorin&#x27;s barouche from the station to Notre Dame, and their procession was greeted with bands of music, the toil of the bells of Notre Dame, and plenty decorations and illuminations. The local chapter of the Ancient Order of Hibernians acted as escort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholastic, 08/25/1888&quot;&gt;&quot;Scholastic&quot;, August 25, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; The jubilee was also attended by other high-profile members of the church, such as two archbishops (William H. Elder of Cincinnati and John Ireland of St. Paul) and twelve bishops (Richard Gilmour of Cleveland, Joseph Dwenger of Fort Wayne, John Watterson of Columbus, Richard Phelan of Pittsburgh, James Ryan of Alton, John Janssen of Belleville, John Keane of Washington, D.C., Maurice Burke of Cheyenne, John Lancaster Spalding of Peoria, Stephen V. Ryan of Buffalo, and Henry J. Richter of Grand Rapids). The events of August 15 started with the consecration of Sacred Heart Church, led by bishop Dwenger, followed by the blessing of the large bell by bishop Burke. A High Mass was celebrated by Cardinal Gibbons, with a sermon by Archbishop Ireland and a choir from Chicago that sang Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Imperial Mass. This was followed by a lavish banquet in the Main Building refectories.

Sorin&#x27;s golden jubilee was the climax of a long history of expansion and success for the Congregation and the university, and for the Catholic Church in America as whole. O&#x27;Connel writes that &quot;What had been accomplished at Notre Dame under [Sorin&#x27;s] stewardship seemed to a wider public emblematic of the growth and maturing of the American Catholic Church as a whole, an there were those in high places anxious to give expression to this fact.  To honor the founder of Notre Dame was in effect to proclaim the enduring and legitimate status of the Church, after much struggle, had attained within American society.  In accord, therefore, with the late nineteenth century&#x27;s predilection for gaudy celebrations, featuring bands and banquets, fireworks and fiery oratory, plans were formulated at the beginning of 1888 to solemnize Father Sorin&#x27;s golden anniversary as a national as well as personal triumph.&quot;

Soon after the celebration of his golden jubilee, Sorin entered into a long period of mental and physical suffering. He died a peaceful and painless death of Bright&#x27;s Disease at the University of Notre Dame on the eve of All Saints&#x27; Day, October 31, 1893. The funeral, which was attended by a large crowd, was celebrate on November 11 in the Church of the Sacred Heart and Archbishop William Henry Elder gave the funeral homily. He was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery, as is tradition for all members of the Congregation.

== Legacy ==
Several memorials have been dedicated to Sorin on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. A statue of Edward F. Sorin, on the intersection of the main and south quads, is one of the main landmarks on the Notre Dame Campus. Sorin Hall was dedicated to Sorin in 1888, with Sorin himself present. Sorin Court, a street behind Main Building, and &quot;Sorin&#x27;s&quot;, the restaurant inside the Morris Inn, are also named after him. Several other programs on campus, such as the Sorin Fellows and the Sorin Scholars, are named in his honor. The city of South Bend has dedicated Sorin Street and Sorin Park in his honor, and Sorin Street in Austin is also named after him. Sorinsville was an Irish immigrant neighborhood in South Bend that developed in the 19th and 20th centuries. On the campus of St. Edward&#x27;s University, Sorin Hall and the Sorin Oak, the largest oak tree in Austin, are named after him.

Both the University of Notre Dame and St. Edward&#x27;s University celebrate Founder&#x27;s Day in his honor. At the Notre Dame, Founder&#x27;s Day started being celebrated almost immediately in the early 1840s. By Sorin&#x27;s own request, the celebrations took place on October 13, feast of his patron saint St. Edward, instead of Sorin&#x27;s birthday. Students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary&#x27;s celebrated with theatrical and musical performances, fireworks, athletic events, a feast in the dining halls, and by sending cards and well wishes to Sorin. Over the years, the magnitude of the festivity waned, and by the 1960s a wreath was lay at the bottom of Sorin&#x27;s statue, and in recent times it is commemorated simply with a special Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. In 2014, Notre Dame launched a year-long celebration to commemorate the Bicentennial of the birth of Sorin. The celebration was kicked-off with a Mass while the dining hall served a special French cuisine feast. During the year, the University Archives launched a major effort to digitize Sorin&#x27;s papers, the Hesburgh library hosted a Sorin Exhibit in the main concourse, and several lectures about Sorin were held.

<text>Roger Carl Schank (March 12, 1946 – January 29, 2023) was an American artificial intelligence theorist, cognitive psychologist, learning scientist, educational reformer, and entrepreneur. Beginning in the late 1960s, he pioneered conceptual dependency theory (within the context of natural language understanding) and case-based reasoning, both of which challenged cognitivist views of memory and reasoning. He began his career teaching at Yale University and Stanford University. In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a ten-year commitment to his research and development by Andersen Consulting, through which he founded the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at Northwestern University in Chicago.

==Early life==
Schank was born in Manhattan, New York, in 1946, and he attended Stuyvesant High School.

==Academic career==
For his undergraduate degree, Schank studied mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA, and later was awarded a PhD in linguistics at the University of Texas in Austin and went on to work in faculty positions at Stanford University and then at Yale University. In 1974, he became professor of computer science and psychology at Yale University. In 1981, Schank became Chairman of Computer Science at Yale and director of the Yale Artificial Intelligence Project.

In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a ten-year commitment to his research and development by Andersen Consulting, allowing him to leave Yale and set up the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at Northwestern University in Chicago, bringing along 25 of his Yale colleagues. ILS attracted other corporate sponsors such as IBM and Ameritech, as well as government sponsors such as the U.S. Army, EPA and the National Guard, leading to a focus on the development of educational software, especially in employee training. ILS was later absorbed by the School of Education as a separate department.

When Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Silicon Valley campus was established in 2002, Schank came to serve as Chief Educational Officer at the institution. He was a Founding Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 1990.

==Entrepreneurship==
While at Yale in 1979, Schank was among the first to &quot;capitalize on the expected boom&quot; in AI when he founded Cognitive Systems, a company that went public in 1986. Schank resigned as chairman and chief executive in 1988 for personal reasons, but stayed as a board member and advisor.

In 1994, Schank founded Cognitive Arts Corporation (originally named Learning Sciences Corporation) to market the software developed at ILS, and led the company until it was sold in 2003.

From 2005 to 2007, Schank was the chief learning officer of Trump University.

In 2001 he founded Socratic Arts, a company that sells e-learning software to both businesses and schools.

In 2008, Schank built a story-centered curriculum (SCC) at the Business Engineering School of La Salle International Graduate School of Ramon Llull University, Barcelona to teach MBA students to launch their own businesses or to go to work.

In 2012, Schank founded XTOL (Experiential Training Online) which &quot;designs learn-by-doing experiential short courses for use by universities, corporations and professional organizations, as well as Master&#x27;s programs in partnership with degree-granting universities around the world&quot;.

==Educational reform==
Schank believed that the educational system is fundamentally broken and that software will need to replace conventional teaching methods. To serve this purpose, he founded Engines for Education in 2001, a not-for-profit organization which designs and implements curricula for primary and secondary schools and hosts the Virtual International Science and Technology Academy (VISTA).

==Influence==
In 1969 Schank introduced the conceptual dependency theory for natural language understanding. This model, partly based on the work of Sydney Lamb, was extensively used by Schank&#x27;s students at Yale University, such as Robert Wilensky, Wendy Lehnert, and Janet Kolodner, in a series of models of natural language processing.

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is based on Schank&#x27;s model of dynamic memory and was the basis for the earliest CBR systems: Janet Kolodner&#x27;s CYRUS and Michael Lebowitz&#x27;s IPP.

Other schools of CBR and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s, investigating such topics as CBR in legal reasoning, memory-based reasoning (a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines), and combinations of CBR with other reasoning methods. In the 1990s, interest in CBR grew, as evidenced by the establishment of an International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning in 1995, as well as European, German, British, Italian, and other CBR workshops.

CBR technology has produced a number of successful deployed systems, the earliest being Lockheed&#x27;s CLAVIER, a system for laying out composite parts to be baked in an industrial convection oven. CBR has been used extensively in help desk applications such as the Compaq SMART system and has found a major application area in the health sciences.

==Personal life and death==
Schank was married twice. His first marriage, to Diane Levine, ended when they divorced in 1998; he then married Annie Payeur in or around 1999. He had two children.

Schank had homes in Palm Beach, Florida and Quebec. In Florida, he was a neighbor of Jeffrey Epstein, and attended an artificial intelligence conference sponsored by him on his island in 2002, six years before Epstein was convicted of sex offenses in 2008. After the conviction, Schank showed public support for him.

After a period of failing health, Schank died from heart failure under hospice care in Shelburne, Vermont, on January 29, 2023, at the age of 76.

<text>The National Zoological Garden of South Africa (; also informally known as The Pretoria Zoo) is an zoo located in Pretoria, South Africa. It is the national zoo of South Africa, and was founded by J. W. B. Gunning in 1899. Pretoria Zoo is one of the eight largest zoos in the world.

==History==
The farm &quot;Klein Schoemansdal&quot;, the property of Z.A.R. president Stephanus Schoeman, was sold to Johannes Francois Celliers who renamed it &quot;Rus in Urbe&quot;. It was acquired by the state in 1895, and the zoological garden was established at the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. It became the official National Zoological Gardens in 1916. After a period of management under the auspices of the South African National Research Foundation, the Pretoria Zoo today is management under the umbrella of the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI).

In 2024, the zoo transferred its last elephant, Charley, to a wildlife reserve following negotiations between the South African government and animal rights groups protesting against his confinement.

==Landscape==
Half of the zoo is situated on relatively flat ground, while the other half is located on the slopes of a hill. The two areas are separated by the Apies River flowing through the zoo. Two bridges provide access over the river.

==Infrastructure==
Around of pathways are laid out in the zoo. Golf carts are available for rent for those that prefer not to walk; most, but not all of the exhibits are accessible by golf cart. A cable car links the top of the hill with a point close to the entrance at the bottom. Two restaurants are located within the zoo, besides a picnic area on the banks of the Apies River. A crafts market is located outside the zoo entrance.

==Exhibits==

Proceeding from the entrance a visitor encounters a walk-through aviary, enclosures for African penguins, Cape fur seals, leopards, flamingoes, and lemurs, further bird aviaries and the hamadryas baboon and monkey enclosures along the western boundary.

At the centre of the zoo large sections are set aside for the African savannah waterhole and a set of large enclosures for smaller carnivores, cheetahs, black and white rhinos, giraffes, African bush elephants, hippos, plains zebras, African buffaloes and okapis respectively. Amongst these are smaller enclosures for primates, African wild dogs, red kangaroos and breeding units for birds.

Against the northern hillside are large enclosures for lions, tigers, brown bears, Nubian ibexes, western lowland gorillas and other animals. In the western section the zoo includes two aquariums, and a reptile park, accessed via a separate entrance.

<doc id="1076550" wikidata="Q4502087" url="?curid=1076550" title="USS Babbitt">
<text>USS &quot;Babbitt&quot; (DD–128) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and World War II, later classified as AG-102. She was named for Fitz Babbitt. As of 2010, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Babbitt&quot; was launched on 30 September 1918 at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Miss Lucile Burlin. The destroyer was commissioned on 24 October 1919 and reported to the Pacific Fleet.

==Service history==
&quot;Babbitt&quot; served with the Pacific Fleet on maneuvers and exercises until going out of commission at San Diego on 15 June 1922. Upon recommissioning on 4 April 1930, &quot;Babbitt&quot; reported to the Pacific Fleet and served along the west coast until February 1931, when she proceeded to the Atlantic Ocean. Between February 1931 and May 1932, she operated with Destroyer Squadron, Scouting Force, along the eastern seaboard, in the West Indies, the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Panama Canal Zone. During May 1932 to April 1933, &quot;Babbitt&quot; served at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, and made a cruise to Chile conducting exercises with experimental torpedoes. She was assigned to Rotating Reserve Destroyer Squadron 19 at Norfolk between 25 May and 20 October 1933, and then assumed reduced commission status until January 1935.

<doc id="1076562" wikidata="Q157741" url="?curid=1076562" title="Cologne Bonn Airport">
<text>Cologne Bonn Airport () is the international airport of Germany&#x27;s fourth-largest city Cologne, and also serves Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. With approximately 12.4 million passengers passing through it in 2017, it is the seventh-largest passenger airport in Germany and the third-largest in terms of cargo operations. By traffic units, which combines cargo and passengers, the airport is in fifth position in Germany. As of March 2015, Cologne Bonn Airport had services to 115 passenger destinations in 35 countries. The airport is named after Cologne native Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war Chancellor of West Germany. The facility covers and contains three runways.

The airport is located in the district of Porz and is surrounded by Wahner Heide, a nature reserve. The airport is centrally located in the Cologne Bonn Region southeast of the Cologne city centre and northeast of Bonn. Cologne Bonn Airport is one of the country&#x27;s few 24-hour airports and serves as a hub for Eurowings, FedEx Express and UPS Airlines as well as a focus city for several leisure and low-cost airlines. It is also a host of a training centre for the German (DLR) and European (EAC) astronaut programmes, part of the European Space Agency.

Cologne Bonn airport is only south of larger Düsseldorf Airport, the main airport of the Rhine-Ruhr region, and also competes with Frankfurt Airport, Germany&#x27;s largest international airport, which can be reached from Cologne within 47 minutes by the Intercity Express high-speed train. The airport is jointly owned by the City of Cologne (31.12%), the Federal Republic of Germany (30.94%), the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (30.94%), the City of Bonn (6.06%) and two counties: Rhein-Sieg-Kreis (0.59%) and Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis (0.35%).

==History==
===20th century===
In 1938, the first airfield was built on site for the German Luftwaffe. After World War II the British military took over and expanded the airport (as RAF Wahn - B-119). A 1,866 m runway was built in this period. 

The following squadrons used RAF Wahn: 2 Squadron between 28 June 1948 and 15 September 1949 then again between 1 July 1953 and 28 October 1955, 4 Squadron between 13 November 1947 and 1 March 1948 then the squadron alternating with RAF Lubeck until 19 September 1949, 11 Squadron between 15 September 1948 and 17 September 1949, 14 Squadron between 1 April 1946 and 16 September 1949, 17 Squadron between 1 June 1956 and 3 April 1957, 21 Squadron between 3 and 26 September 1946, 68 Squadron between 1 January 1952 and 22 July 1957, 69 Squadron between 31 March 1946 and 7 November 1947, 87 Squadron between 1 January 1952 and 2 July 1957, 98 Squadron between 15 March 1946 and 19 September 1949, 107 Squadron between 3 September 1946 and 15 September 1948, 128 Squadron between 11 and 31 March 1946, 180 Squadron between 8 and 31 March 1946 &amp; 305 Squadron between 11 March and 15 October 1946.

In 1950 the airport was opened for civilian air traffic to serve both Cologne and West Germany&#x27;s then new capital, Bonn, superseding the former Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport. 

The first scheduled international route was London-Cologne/Bonn-Berlin operated by BEA, inaugurated on 1 January 1951. A second and third runway was opened in 1954 and 1961 subsequently. That same year Lufthansa inaugurated the first scheduled intercontinental service from Cologne/Bonn to New York City.

The new passenger terminal, which still exists today as Terminal 1, was inaugurated in 1970. The airport&#x27;s passenger and freight facilities have been extended substantially during the 1970s. In 1978, the airport handled more than 2 million passengers for the first time.
Cologne Bonn Airport was chosen by United Parcel Service (UPS) in 1986 as the location for their European hub. TNT Express followed in 1988.

By 1990, the airport handled three million passengers per year. In the mid-1990s the airport started another major expansion program. Several new parking lots, a new control tower and a second terminal were built, and in 2004 a new long-distance railway station connecting the airport with InterCityExpress trains was opened.

===Developments since the 2000s===
Coinciding with the start of several low-cost airlines in Germany, Cologne/Bonn opened new capacities. This enabled the airport to make competitive offers to the airlines. Consequently, Germanwings and TUIfly started operations from Cologne/Bonn as their hub in the fall of 2002. As a result, the number of passengers in 2003 rose by 43% compared to 2002. These airlines were joined by easyJet in late 2003 and Wizz Air in June 2006.

Also, the Canadian Forces began to use the airport as a staging area to move troops and supplies in support of humanitarian missions and possible anti-terrorism roles.

In 2006, the Brazilian airline BRA provided a twice a week connection to Rio de Janeiro–Galeão, which was discontinued in April 2007 due to problems with the airline. Also in 2006, a daily transatlantic flight to New Jersey&#x27;s Newark Liberty International Airport by Continental Airlines was established, operating with a Boeing 757-200. This route was discontinued on 4 September 2008 due to a reduction in passenger numbers.

Low-cost carriers Ryanair and Norwegian Air Shuttle began service to Cologne/Bonn in May 2012. In April 2014, Ryanair announced the opening of their fifth German base at Cologne/Bonn Airport for October 2014. In December 2014, Lufthansa announced it would base Eurowings&#x27; new long-haul operations at Cologne Bonn Airport with flights to Florida, Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean to start by the end of 2015. Meanwhile, Condor cancelled their service to Varadero after only one season due to the expected competition. In February 2018, Eurowings announced the relocation of all long-haul operations from Cologne consisting of four Airbus A330 aircraft to Düsseldorf Airport by late October 2018 leaving the airport without any long-haul passenger routes again. In 2024, Wizz Air announced it would terminate all routes from Cologne/Bonn, which it had served for ten years.

==Facilities==

Cologne Bonn Airport has two passenger terminals which are located directly beside each other.

===Terminal 1===
The older Terminal 1 is a 1970s building that sports large surfaces of bare concrete in its design. It features a u-shaped main building with shops, restaurants, check-in and service facilities and a visitors deck on its roof as well as the star-shaped piers B and C with five aircraft stands each plus a central airside hall between them added in 2004 with joint security-check facilities, more shops and restaurants as well as three additional stands. All ten stands at both piers feature jet bridges while the other three use walk-boarding. Also several bus-boarding stands are available at the apron. Terminal 1 is used by Eurowings, which occupy most of the landside check-in facilities, Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines. Terminal 1 features its own direct connection to the railway station.

===Terminal 2===
Construction of Terminal 2 began in June 1997, and operations at the terminal commenced on 21 June 2000. It is located to the north of Terminal 1. Both feature separate check-in facilities but are connected through a landside walkway. As part of a plan-approval procedure the airport is currently seeking approval for building an airside connection between both terminals. Terminal 2 is a modern-style rectangular building made out of glass and steel which is equipped with eight stands with jet bridges as well as several stands for bus-boarding. It is used by several airlines such as Ryanair. Terminal 2 is also directly connected to the airports&#x27; railway station via the basement level. The terminal hosts an interdenominational prayer room on its base level.

==Airlines and destinations==
=== Passenger ===
The following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at Cologne Bonn Airport:


===Cargo===
Cologne Bonn Airport is a major cargo hub in the world mainly due to its function as a hub for FedEx Express and UPS Airlines, which operates 140 flights per week at the airport alone.

==Military use==
The German Air Force&#x27;s Executive Transport Wing is based on the south-western side of the airport, adjacent to the Wahn Air Force Barracks. The military part of the airport is also used by the Canadian Forces as an operational support hub.

==Statistics==


==Ground transportation==
===Train===
Cologne/Bonn Airport station is a four-track railway station on a loop off the Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed line that connects Cologne Bonn Airport to long-distance trains at least once an hour per direction, most of them ICE services. The station lies directly across both terminals under a large glass roof and features direct connections to the basement of Terminal 2 as well as the check-in area at Terminal 1-C. The S-Bahn line &quot;S 19&quot; to Düren and regional train line &quot;RE 6&quot; to Minden (Westfalen) connects the airport station with via Cologne Main Station. &quot;RB 27&quot; between Mönchengladbach and Koblenz calls at the airport station as well.

===Car===
The airport has its own exit (named &quot;Flughafen&quot;) on motorway A59 which links it to the city centres of Cologne and Bonn as well as the Ruhrgebiet.

===Bus===
Local bus lines also connect the airport with Cologne (route &quot;161&quot;) and Bonn (route &quot;SB60&quot;). On 28 October 2015, a new coach terminal opened and is used for remote bus services to other German cities and many other European countries.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On April 4, 1978, a Spantax Convair 990 landing at Cologne Bonn Airport forgot to pull out the landing gear and the aircraft slid over the runway, resulting in the right wing catching fire. Two fire-fighting vehicles from the airport fire service that happened to be in the immediate vicinity probably prevented casualties in this accident. All 146 people on board escaped unharmed.
* On June 7, 1993, a Learjet 35A operated by Aero-Dienst crashed following a left engine failure at or near V2. The aircraft rolled to the left, contacted the ground beside the runway, levelled off, took off again and rolled left and inverted and impacted the ground. All four occupants were killed. Cause undetermined.

<text>Airport &#x27;77 is a 1977 American air disaster film, the third installment of the &quot;Airport&quot; film series. The film stars an ensemble cast of veteran actors including Jack Lemmon, James Stewart, Joseph Cotten, Olivia de Havilland, and Brenda Vaccaro as well as the return of George Kennedy from the two previous &quot;Airport&quot; films. It is directed by Jerry Jameson, produced by William Frye, executive produced by Jennings Lang with a screenplay by Michael Scheff and David Spector.

The plot concerns a private Boeing 747 packed with VIPs and priceless art that is hijacked before crashing into the ocean in the Bermuda Triangle, forcing the survivors into a desperate struggle for survival.

Despite mixed critical reviews, &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; was a box-office hit, grossing $91.1 million worldwide. It was nominated for two Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens is having invited guests flown in his luxurious privately-owned Boeing 747-100, Stevens Flight 23, to his Palm Beach, Florida estate. Aboard are his estranged adult daughter and her young son, whom he hopes to reconnect with, as he is secretly dying. Priceless artwork from Stevens&#x27; private collection destined for his new museum is also on the jetliner. The collection has motivated a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft.

Mid-flight, Captain Don Gallagher is lured from the cockpit and knocked unconscious. A sleeping gas secretly installed pre-flight is released into the cabin, rendering unprotected crew and passengers unconscious. Chambers, flying to a small deserted island to offload the art treasures, drops the plane below radar range causing Stevens Flight 23 to &quot;disappear&quot; in the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtually wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility. Minutes later, a large offshore platform emerges from the haze, and Flight 23&#x27;s wing clips the platform&#x27;s tower, igniting an engine. Chambers extinguishes the fire, but due to a sudden loss of airspeed, the plane stalls and crashes into the water, floating momentarily before sinking below the surface.

The plane settles in relatively shallow water that is above the plane&#x27;s crush depth, though water pressure gradually compromises the fuselage. Many passengers are injured, some seriously. Chambers, the only surviving hijacker, reveals the plane is two hundred miles off course, meaning search and rescue efforts will be focused in the wrong area. As a search for the missing plane is launched, veteran aeronautics expert Joe Patroni joins the rescue operation as a technical adviser, joined by Philip Stevens. Meanwhile, the trapped crew can only contact rescuers by getting a signal buoy to the surface. Captain Gallagher and a professional diver, Martin Wallace, enter the main cargo preparing to swim to the surface using air masks. The hatch door malfunctions, forcing Wallace to open it manually. The sudden onrush of water kills him, but Gallagher is able to make it to the surface and activate the emergency beacon. The signal is detected and a rescue operation is launched. Meanwhile, the plane&#x27;s fuselage is steadily leaking, and on top of that, air is running out.

The Navy dispatches a sub-recovery ship, the USS &quot;Cayuga&quot;, USS &quot;Agerholm&quot; and a flotilla of other vessels to the crash site, rescuing Gallagher. Stevens, meanwhile, has joined the &quot;Cayuga&quot; via helicopter while Patroni stays on the mainland to study the aircraft&#x27;s risks of imploding underwater, which he warns Gallagher about over the phone. Guided by Gallagher, Navy divers rig the plane with balloons and inflate them, slowly raising the aircraft. Just before the plane reaches the surface, a balloon breaks loose and pressure is reduced to stabilize the aircraft. A cargo hold door inside the plane bursts open and seawater swamps the cabin; Chambers and Wallace&#x27;s widow Karen drown, while Emily’s injured friend Dorothy dies from her injuries. With time running out, air pressure is increased, raising the plane to the surface, and all survivors are quickly evacuated. Captain Gallagher and Stevens&#x27; assistant, Eve (whom Gallagher is in love with), become trapped inside and escape through the upper deck where they are fished out of the ocean by a Navy helicopter, as the 747 sinks under the waves for the last time. Stevens reunites with his daughter and tearfully hugs his grandson, while the helicopter carrying Gallagher and Eve lands aboard the &quot;Agerholm&quot;, where they are both met by the grateful survivors.

==Production note==

Although the disaster portrayed in the film is fictional, rescue operations depicted in the movie are actual rescue operations utilized by the Navy in the event of similar emergencies or disasters, as indicated at the end of the film prior to the closing credits. The disaster itself—a hard water landing as shown in the film, and an intact sinking—would not be likely given the hard tailstrike, which would have demolished the aircraft.

For its initial broadcast on NBC-TV in September 1978, an additional 70 minutes of outtakes and new footage shot especially for network TV was added.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 40% of 10 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.4/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The story&#x27;s formula banality is credible most of the time and there&#x27;s some good actual US Navy search and rescue procedure interjected in the plot.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, &quot;The movie&#x27;s a big, slick entertainment, relentlessly ridiculous and therefore never boring for long.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; looks less like the work of a director and writers than like a corporate decision.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $30 million in the United States and Canada and $61 million internationally for a worldwide total of $91.1 million.

==Award nominations==
==Theme park attraction==
From late 1977 until the early 1980s, the Universal Studios Tour in California featured the &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; Screen Test Theater as part of the tour. Several sets were recreated, and members of the audience were chosen to play various parts. The audience would watch as these scenes were filmed. Key scenes such as the hijacking, crash and rescue were recreated, and the footage was then incorporated into a brief digest version of the film and screened for the audience on monitors. Each show&#x27;s mini-film was made available for audience members to purchase on 8 mm film and videotape.

<doc id="1076578" wikidata="Q257652" url="?curid=1076578" title="Beatsteaks">
<text>The Beatsteaks are a German alternative rock and punk rock band from Berlin, formed in 1995. Known for their energetic performances and distinctive sound, they have become one of the most commercially successful German punk rock groups, often mentioned alongside Die Toten Hosen and Die Ärzte. Over the years, the Beatsteaks have released several critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums, blending punk rock&#x27;s raw energy with alternative rock&#x27;s melodic elements. Their live shows are particularly celebrated for their high energy and crowd interaction, solidifying their status as a must-see act in the punk and alternative rock scenes.

==History==
Peter Baumann, Stefan Hircher, Alexander Rosswaag and Bernd Kurtzke founded Beatsteaks in 1995. Shortly afterwards, Arnim Teutoburg-Weiß joined the band as singer and additional guitarist. In 1996, the band won a local music competition in &quot;SO36&quot; and played as opening act for the Sex Pistols at a concert in Berlin. This was also the band&#x27;s tenth live performance.

In 1997, the band recorded their first album &quot;48/49&quot;, named after the number of their rehearsal space. It contains several songs in German, while the more recent albums are in English. In 1999 they released their second album, &quot;Launched&quot;, on the American punk label Epitaph Records. Thomas Götz had joined the band on drums, while on bass, Torsten Scholz replaced Alexander in 2000. This was followed by tours with Bad Religion, Die Ärzte and Die Toten Hosen, bringing the band to a wider audience.

In 2002, they released their third album &quot;Living Targets&quot;. From this album, Beatsteaks released their first two singles &quot;Let Me In&quot; and &quot;Summer&quot;. At the end of 2002, the band played a concert at the Columbiahalle in Berlin and recorded the EP &quot;Wohnzimmer&quot;. Ticket holders for the Berlin concert each received a &#x27;free&#x27; copy of the EP.

German band Die Ärzte mentioned the Beatsteaks in their 2003 song &quot;Unrockbar&quot;, which brought increased attention to the Beatsteaks: &quot;Wie kannst du bei den Beatsteaks ruhig sitzen bleiben, wenn dir doch Schlagersänger Tränen in die Augen treiben?&quot; (&quot;How can you remain unmoved by the Beatsteaks, while Schlager singers bring tears to your eyes?&quot;).

Their breakthrough was achieved in Berlin in 2004 with the album &quot;Smack Smash&quot;, and particularly with the second single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care as Long as You Sing&quot; with which they won the MTV European Music Awards 2004 in the category Best German Act. At the end of 2005, they released the double DVD &quot;B-Seite&quot;, which included a self-produced documentary on the band&#x27;s history, a compilation of several concerts, and music videos of the band up to this point. In 2006, they played a short summer tour, consisting of three concerts and two festival performances. Following the release of the preliminary single &quot;Jane Became Insane&quot; on 9 March 2007, their fifth album, &quot;.limbo messiah&quot;, appeared on 30 March 2007.

On 7 June 2007, the band played a concert for a charity foundation, as part of the &quot;Deine Stimme gegen Armut&quot; (literally &quot;Your voice against poverty&quot;) campaign in Rostock in front of a 70,000 strong audience. One month later, on 7 July 2007, they played in the sold-out Wuhlheide in Berlin, their then-largest headlining concert, in front of approximately 17,000 fans.

In 2007, the Beatsteaks were again nominated in the category Best German Act at the EMAs and won the audience prize &quot;1Live Krone&quot; for the best live act.

On 2 May 2008, the live album &quot;Kanonen auf Spatzen&quot; was released, which includes two CDs and one DVD in the deluxe package, or the first CD in an economy version.

Torsten Scholz said in an interview that the Beatsteaks would start writing new songs after the end of their Limbo Messiah tour in August 2008.

The Beatsteaks completed work on their most recent album &quot;Boombox&quot;, which was released on 28 January 2011. The first single from the album was &quot;Milk &amp; Honey&quot;, released on 2 December. On 8 April 2011, the second single, &quot;Cheap Comments&quot;, was released. The third single off &quot;Boombox&quot; was &quot;Automatic&quot;, co-written by Peter Fox.

In June 2011, the band announced their song &quot;House on Fire&quot; was to be featured on the European soundtrack of &quot;&quot;.

In 2013, the band released the live CD/DVD &quot;Muffensausen&quot;. On 15 May 2014, they released the song &quot;DNA&quot; as the first single of their record &quot;Beatsteaks&quot;, which was released on 1 August 2014. &quot;Gentleman of the Year&quot; and &quot;Make a Wish&quot; are also two singles that have been released from the self-titled record.

In 2015, the Beatsteaks celebrated their 20th anniversary with two concerts at the Kindl-Bühne Wuhlheide in Berlin.

<doc id="1076585" wikidata="Q1179260" url="?curid=1076585" title="Dayuan">
<text>Dayuan (or Tayuan; ; Middle Chinese &quot;dâiC-jwɐn&quot; &lt; LHC: &quot;dɑh-ʔyɑn&quot;) is the Chinese exonym for a country that existed in Ferghana valley in Central Asia, described in the Chinese historical works of &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. It is mentioned in the accounts of the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian in 130 BCE and the numerous embassies that followed him into Central Asia. The country of Dayuan is generally accepted as relating to the Ferghana Valley, controlled by the Hellenistic city-state Alexandria Eschate (modern Khujand, Tajikistan), which can probably be understood as &quot;Greco-Fergana city-state&quot; in English language.

These Chinese accounts describe the &quot;Dayuan&quot; as urbanized dwellers with European phenotypes, living in walled cities and having &quot;customs identical to those of the Daxia&quot; or Greco-Bactrians, a Hellenistic kingdom that was ruling Bactria at that time in today&#x27;s northern Afghanistan. It is very likely that the Dayuan formed the northern part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. The Dayuan are also described as manufacturers and great lovers of wine.

The Dayuan were the descendants of Greeks forcibly resettled in the area by the Persian Empire, as well as the subsequent Greek colonists that were settled by Alexander the Great in Ferghana in 329 BCE (see Alexandria Eschate), and had prospered within the Hellenistic realm of the Seleucids and Greco-Bactrians, until they were isolated by the migrations of the Yuezhi around 160 BCE and the Scythians in 140. It appears that the name &quot;Yuan&quot; was simply a transliteration of Sanskrit &quot;Yavana&quot; or Pali &quot;Yona&quot;, used in Asia to designate Greeks (&quot;Ionians&quot;), so Dayuan meant &quot;Great Ionians&quot;.
By 100 BC, the Dayuan were attacked and then defeated by the Han dynasty in the Han-Dayuan war. The interaction between the Dayuan and the Chinese is historically crucial, since it represents one of the first major contacts between an urbanized civilization in Central Asia and the Chinese civilization, opening the way to the formation of the Silk Road that was to link the East and the West in material and cultural exchange from the 1st century BCE to the 15th century.

==History==
===Persia===
This region was ruled over by Persia starting with Xerxes I, and began to be populated by Greeks starting at this time. When Greeks in other parts of the Persian empire rebelled or otherwise were troublesome, they would be exiled to Sogdia in the far northeast of the Persian empire, the most distant segment from their homelands. The largest city in this northeastern outpost of the Persian empire was known to the Greeks as Cyropolis, after the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great. By the time of the fall of Persia to Alexander the Great, Greek villages, language, and culture were therefore all common in this area.

===Hellenistic rule (329–160 BCE)===

The region of Ferghana was conquered by Alexander the Great in 329 BCE and became his most advanced base in Central Asia. He founded (probably by occupying and renaming Cyropolis) the fortified city of Alexandria Eschate (Lit. &quot;Alexandria the Furthest&quot;) in the southwestern part of the Ferghana valley, on the southern bank of the river Syr Darya (ancient Jaxartes), at the location of the modern city of Khujand (also called Khozdent, formerly Leninabad), in the state of Tajikistan. Alexander built a 6 kilometer long brick wall around the city and, as similarly in the cases of the other cities he founded, had a garrison of his retired veterans and wounded settle there.

The whole of Bactria, Transoxiana and the area of Ferghana remained under the control of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire until 250 BCE. The region then wrested independence under the leadership of its Greek governors Diodotus I of Bactria, to become the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.

===Greco-Bactrian kingdom (250–160 BCE)===
The Greco-Bactrians held their territory, and according to the Greek historian Strabo even went beyond Alexandria Eschate and &quot;extended their empire as far as the Serica and the Phryni&quot; (Strabo XI.XI.I). There are indications that they may have led expeditions as far as Kashgar in Xinjiang, leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 200 BCE. Various statuettes and representations of Greek soldiers have been found north of the Tien Shan, and are today on display in the museum of Urumqi (Boardman). King Euthydemus I originally ruled in Sogdia and the area of the Dayuan, before overthrowing the dynasty of Diodotus in Bactria.

Around 160 BCE, the area of Ferghana seems to have been invaded by Saka tribes (called the Sai-Wang by the Chinese). The Sai-Wang, originally settled in the Ili valley in the general area of Lake Issyk Kul, were retreating southward after having been dislodged by Yuezhi (who themselves were fleeing from the Xiongnu):

The Sakas occupied the Greek territory of Dayuan, benefiting from the fact that the Greco-Bactrians were fully occupied with conflicts in India against the Indo-Greeks, and could hardly defend their northern provinces. According to W. W. Tarn,

===Saka rule===

The Saka rule of Dayuan possibly started in 160 BCE. When the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian described Dayuan around 128 BCE, he mentioned, besides the flourishing urbanized civilization, there were warriors &quot;shooting arrows on horseback&quot;, a probable description of nomadic horse archers that were typical of the steppe civilizations at the time, of which Saka was one. Dayuan had probably by then become a kingdom of militaristic Saka ruling class exacting taxes and tributes from the local Hellenistic population.

Also in 106–101 BCE, during their conflict with China, the country of Dayuan is said to have been an ally with the neighbouring tribes of Kangju (probably Sodgia). The Chinese also record the name of the king of Dayuan as &quot;Mu-Kua&quot;, a Saka name rendered in Greek as Mauakes or Maues. Another Scythian ruler by the name of Maues was later a ruler of the Indo-Scythian kingdom in northern India, during the 1st century BCE.

===Yuezhi migration===
According to the Han Chronicles In 132BCE the Yuezhi were driven out of the Ili River valley by the Wusun. They fled south from the Ili river area, by-passed the urban civilization of the Dayuan in Ferghana, and re-settled north of the Oxus in Bactria, definitively cutting Dayuan from contact with the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. The Yuezhi would further expand southward into Bactria proper around 125 BCE, and then going on to form the Kushan Empire in the 1st century CE.

===Han Chinese rule and interaction===
The Dayuan remained a healthy and powerful civilization which had numerous contacts and exchanges with China from 130 BCE.

====Zhang Qian&#x27;s Report====

Around 130 BCE, at the time of Zhang Qian&#x27;s embassy to Central Asia, the Dayuan were described as inhabitants of a region corresponding to the Ferghana, far to the west of the Chinese empire.

To their south-west were the territories of the Yuezhi, with the Greco-Bactrians further south still, beyond the Oxus.

The Shiji then explains that the Yuezhi originally inhabited the Hexi Corridor, before they were defeated by the Xiongnu under Mao-tun and later his son in 176 BCE, forcing them to go beyond the territory of the Dayuan and resettle in the West by the banks of the Oxus, between the territory of the Dayuan and Bactria to the south.

====Urbanized city-dwellers====
The customs of the Dayuan are said by Zhang Qian to be identical to those of the Bactrians in the south, who actually formed the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom at that time.


They are described as town-dwellers, as opposed to other populations such as the Yuezhi, the Wusun or the Xiongnu who were nomads.

====Appearance and Culture====
The Shiji comments on the appearance and the culture of the people around Dayuan:

Although the states from Dayuan west to Anxi speak rather different languages, their customs are generally similar and their languages mutually intelligible. The men all have deep-set eyes and profuse beards and whiskers. They are skillful at commerce and will haggle over a fraction of a cent. Women are held in great respect, and the men make decisions on the advice of their women.

They were great manufacturers and lovers of wine:

According to the Shiji, grapes and alfalfa were introduced to China from Dayuan following Zhang Qian&#x27;s embassy:

The regions around Dayuan make wine out of grapes, the wealthier inhabitants keeping as much as 10,000 or more piculs stored away. It can be kept for as long as twenty or thirty years without spoiling. The people love their wine and the horses love their alfalfa. The Han envoys brought back grape and alfalfa seeds to China and the emperor for the first time tried growing these plants in areas of rich soil. Later, when the Han acquired large numbers of the &quot;heavenly horses&quot; and the envoys from foreign states began to arrive with their retinues, the lands on all sides of the emperor&#x27;s summer palaces and pleasure towers were planted with grapes and alfalfa for as far as the eye could see.

The Shiji also claims that metal casting was introduced to the Dayuan region by Han deserters:

... the casting of coins and vessels was formerly unknown. Later, however, when some of the Chinese soldiers attached to the Han embassies ran away and surrendered to the people of the area, they taught them how to cast metal and manufacture weapons.

====Han-Dayuan war====

Following the reports of Zhang Qian (who was originally sent to obtain an alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu, in vain), the Chinese emperor Wudi became interested in developing commercial relationships with the sophisticated urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia: &quot;The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Ferghana (Dayuan) and the possessions of Bactria and Parthia are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China&quot; (Shiji, 123)

The Chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies, around ten every year, to these countries and as far as Seleucid Syria.&quot;Thus more embassies were dispatched to An-si (Parthia), An-ts&#x27;ai (the Aorsi, or Alans), Li-kan (Syria under the Seleucids), T&#x27;iau-chi (Chaldea), and Shon-tu (India)... As a rule, rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year, and at the least five or six.&quot; (Shiji, 123)
The Chinese were also strongly attracted by the tall and powerful horses (&quot;heavenly horses&quot;) in the possession of the Dayuan, which were of capital importance to fight the nomadic Xiongnu. The refusal of the Dayuan to offer them enough horses along with a series of conflicts and mutual disrespect resulted in the death of the Chinese ambassador and the confiscation of the gold sent as payment for the horses.

Enraged, and thinking Dayuan weak, the Chinese Emperor in 104 BCE sent out Li Guangli, the brother of his favorite concubine. He was given 6,000 horsemen and &#x27;30,000 young men of bad reputation rounded up from the provinces&#x27;. General Li lost many men along the way in petty fights with local rulers. After a severe defeat at a place called Yucheng Li concluded that he was not strong enough to take the enemy capital and therefore returned to Dunhuang (about 102 BCE).

Emperor Wudi responded by giving Li Guangli a much larger army along with a huge number of oxen, donkeys and camels to carry supplies. With this force he had no difficulty reaching Ershi, the Dayuan capital. After a 40-day siege the Chinese had broken through the outer wall and cut off the water supply. The nobles of Ershi killed their king and sent his head to Li Guangli, offering the Chinese all the horses they wanted. Li accepted the offer, appointed one of the nobles to be the new king and withdrew with the horses. On his return journey all the petty states accepted Chinese sovereignty. He reached the Jade Gate about 100 BCE with 10,000 men and 1,000 horses.

Contacts with the West were re-established following the peace treaty with the Yuan. Ambassadors were once again sent to the West, caravans were sent to Bactria.

===Era of East-West trade and cultural exchange===
The Silk Road essentially came into being from the 1st century BCE, following the efforts of China to consolidate a road to the Western world, both through direct settlements in the area of the Tarim Basin and diplomatic relations with Dayuan, Parthians and Bactrians further west.

Intense trade followed soon, confirmed by the Roman craze for Chinese silk (supplied by the Parthians) from the 1st century BCE, to the point that the Senate issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three significant authors:
* Strabo (64/ 63 BCE–c. 24 CE).
* Seneca the Younger (c. 3 BCE–65 CE).
* Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE).

This is also the time when the Buddhist faith and the Greco-Buddhist culture started to travel along the Silk Road, entering China from around the 1st century BCE.

<doc id="1076586" wikidata="Q133796" url="?curid=1076586" title="Nagasaki Airport">
<text>is an airport located off the coast of Ōmura, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. The airport was the first airport in the world to be built on the ocean, using an existing small island located in the center of Ōmura Bay, with land areas that were fully reclaimed.

Nagasaki Airport was built to replace the former airport called Omura Airport, which was located on the mainland and had a shorter runway of . The former airport was transferred to the Japan Self-Defense Force in 2011, and was renamed into Omura Air Base.

Oriental Air Bridge, a regional airline is based at the airport.

==History==
The mainland portion of the airport opened as an Imperial Japanese Navy airfield in 1923, and served as the main base for the now defunct 21st Naval Air Base. During World War II, several aircraft factories were constructed near the airfield and the base was used extensively for manufacturing and repairing many aircraft. After the war, the airfield was converted into a civilian airport and was named Omura Airport (大村空港) in 1955. The terminal building was completed four years later in 1959.

All Nippon Airways began flying to Nagasaki from Fukuoka in May 1959.

In the 1960s, Nagasaki Prefecture was considering building a new airport due to the shift in jet-powered aircraft and due to the number of flights increasing at the airport. Initially, the prefecture planned to expand the former airport, but the plan was abandoned, due to geographical issues.
The Prefecture decided to construct the new airport on Mishima Island (), an island located off the coast of the mainland in Ōmura Bay. Before the construction began, 66 residents in 13 households lived on the island and after several years of persuasion from prefecture officials, all of them agreed to move out so that the new airport could be built.

Construction of the new airport began in 1972 and took three years to complete. Constructing the airport required flattening parts of the island&#x27;s hills and reclaiming land around its shore, expanding it from . Around the same time, the Mishima Ohashi Bridge (), a 970 meter long bridge, which connects the island from the mainland was built. Construction of the new airport costed around 18 billion yen.

The current island runway and terminal opened on May 1, 1975, and became Japan&#x27;s first full-scale airport built over water. It was also the first airport in the world to be built on the ocean.

Nagasaki&#x27;s first international service, to Shanghai, commenced in September 1979 and the main runway was extended from 2,500 m to its current length on the following year.

On September 2, 1990, when the Nagasaki Travel Expo was being held in the city of Nagasaki, an Air France Concorde landed at Nagasaki Airport for the first time. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 onlookers gathered at the airport, causing severe traffic jams.

The mainland portion of the airport was abolished in 2011 and was transferred to the Japan Self-Defense Forces, where it was renamed into Omura Air Base.

Before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong Express and China Eastern Airlines operated international flights to and from Hong Kong and Shanghai respectively. In February 2020, the two airlines suspended operations, and international flights at the airport temporarily ceased to exist. In October 2023, China Eastern Airlines resumed flights between Nagasaki and Shanghai after three years and eight months of absence.

<text>The first USS &quot;Hale&quot; (DD–133) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Caldwell&quot; (I20). She was named for Senator Eugene Hale.

== Construction and career ==

=== United States Navy ===

&quot;Hale&quot; was launched by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine on 29 May 1919; sponsored by Miss Mary Hale, granddaughter of Senator Hale. The ship was commissioned at Boston on 12 June 1919.

&quot;Hale&quot; joined Destroyer Squadron 3, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and after training exercises departed 11 July 1919 for Europe. On this cruise, the ship paid goodwill visits to European and Mediterranean ports, assisted in the execution of the Austrian Armistice in October, and joined the American detachment in Turkish waters. &quot;Hale&quot; then carried refugees, relief officials, and freight between the ports of Greece, Bulgaria, and Russia, showing the flag in the vital Mediterranean and Balkan area. She returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 31 March 1920 and resumed her schedule of training and development exercises along the Eastern Coast. &quot;Hale&quot; decommissioned at Philadelphia on 22 June 1922 and remained in reserve until 1 May 1930, when she re-commissioned.

Departing Philadelphia on 15 May, &quot;Hale&quot; took part in refresher training operations and then resumed readiness exercises on the East Coast. She participated in Scouting Fleet maneuvers in early 1931 in the Caribbean, and arrived at San Diego, California via the Panama Canal 4 April 1931. For the next few years &quot;Hale&quot; participated in maneuvers with the Battle Force along the California coast and spent much time perfecting the techniques of modern aircraft carrier tactics with carriers and . The destroyer decommissioned once more at San Diego on 9 April 1937.

&quot;Hale&quot; recommissioned at San Diego on 30 September 1939, at a time of mounting crisis in both oceans, and departed on 25 November for Neutrality Patrol in the Caribbean. Her base was changed to Galveston, Texas on 22 February 1940, and later to Key West, but the ship continued to patrol the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. At Philadelphia on 1 September 1940 she prepared for transfer to Great Britain as a part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. She arrived at Halifax 6 September 1940 and decommissioned 3 days later. Entering the Royal Navy, she became HMS &quot;Caldwell&quot; (I20).

=== Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy ===

During her career in the British Navy, HMS &quot;Caldwell was assigned to escort duty in the Atlantic and later in the Caribbean, as Britain tried desperately to cope with the German U-boat menace. She joined the Royal Canadian Navy in mid-1942 as HMCS &quot;Caldwell, and while returning to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, 18 December 1942, was seriously damaged during a heavy gale. She became disabled, and was found drifting helplessly by &quot;Wanderer&quot; 21 December. &quot;Caldwell&quot; was then towed to St. John&#x27;s and later to Boston. Ready for sea again in May 1943, the ship resumed convoy duty with the Royal Canadian Navy until 1 December, when she returned to Tyne and was placed in reserve. She was broken up for scrap in September 1944.

<text>Aglianico ( , ) is a black grape grown in the southern regions of Italy, mostly Basilicata and Campania. It is considered with Sangiovese and Nebbiolo to be one of the three greatest Italian varieties. Aglianico is sometimes called &quot;The Barolo of the South&quot; () due to its ability to produce highly refined, complex fine wines like the famous wine from Piedmont, Barolo.

== History ==

The origins of both the vine itself and its name are unclear. Traditionally, the vine is thought to have originated in Greece, first cultivated by Phocians from an unidentified ancestral vine; it was then brought to Cumae, near modern-day Pozzuoli, by Greek settlers in the 8th century BC, and from there it spread into southern Italy. However, modern DNA analysis of Aglianico does not support this view, revealing little relation to other Greek grape varieties. Its parentage also remains unknown, implying that it is likely to be endemic to its region. If Aglianico was imported to Italy from Greece, no original Greek plantings have persisted.

The name first appeared in print as the feminine plural in 1520, and several etymological theories persist. The name may be a corruption of , or of , the Latin name for the whole of southern Italy in the time of ancient Rome. However, since there is also no record of the name Aglianico prior to the fifteenth century Spanish conquest of southern Italy, another possible origin of the name is from denoting a grape grown on the plains.
Oenologist Denis Dubourdieu has said &quot;Aglianico is probably the grape with the longest consumer history of all&quot;, claiming that Aglianico was used to make the Falernian wine famed during Roman times. Along with the white grape Greco (used to make the famous Greco di Tufo wine), the red grape of the region was regarded favourably by Pliny the Elder. Traces of the vine have been found in Molise, Apulia, and also on the island of Procida near Naples, although it is no longer widely cultivated in those places.

==Relationship to other grapes==
Despite the similarities in naming, the Campanian wine grape Aglianicone is not a clonal mutation of Aglianico but DNA analysis does suggest a close genetic relationship between the two varieties.

==Wine regions==

In Basilicata, Aglianico is the basis of the Aglianico del Vulture DOC and the region&#x27;s only DOCG wine, Aglianico del Vulture Superiore, concentrated in the northern area of the province of Potenza. The most sought-after productions come from the vineyards located in and around the extinct volcano Mount Vulture.

In Campania, the area in and around the village of Taurasi in the Province of Avellino and the area around the Monte del Taburno in the Province of Benevento produce Aglianico wines bearing the DOCG designation. Taurasi was designated DOCG in 1993, and Aglianico del Taburno in 2011. More Aglianico can be found in the province of Caserta, as the principal grape of Falerno del Massico.

===Other regions===

The grape has also recently been planted in Australia and California, as it thrives in predominantly sunny climates with a long ripening season. In Australia it is being introduced in the Murray Darling region with some success. Producers in McLaren Vale, Margaret River, Mudgee and Riverland are also experimenting with plantings. Elsewhere in North America, it has been trialled in Texas and Arizona, and in Ontario, Canada.

==Viticulture==

The Aglianico vine buds early and grows best in dry climates with generous amounts of sunshine. It has good resistance to outbreaks of oidium, but can be very susceptible to &quot;Peronospora&quot;. It also has low resistance to botrytis, but since it is much too tannic to make a worthwhile dessert wine, the presence of this noble rot in the vineyard is more of a viticultural hazard than an advantage.

The grape has a tendency to ripen late, with harvests as late as November in some parts of southern Italy. If the grape is picked too early, or with excessive yields, the grape can be aggressively tannic. The vine seems to thrive in particularly volcanic soils.

==Wine styles==
Wines produced from Aglianico tend to be full-bodied with firm tannins and high acidity, endowing them with good aging potential. The rich flavors of the wine make it appropriate for pairing with rich meats such as lamb. In Campania, the grape is sometimes blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the production of some &quot;Indicazione Geografica Tipica&quot; (IGT) wines.

In its youth, Aglianico is very tannic and concentrated, requiring a few years of ageing before it can be approachable. As it ages, the fruit becomes more pronounced and the tannins more balanced with the rest of the wine. The trademark coloring of the wine is a deep garnet. In well made examples of the wine, it can have chocolate and plum aromas.

==Synonyms==

Aglianico is also known under the following synonyms: Aglianco di Puglia, Aglianica, Aglianica De Pontelatone, Aglianichella, Aglianichello, Aglianico Amaro, Aglianico Comune, Aglianico Crni, Aglianico del Vulture, Aglianico di Benevento, Aglianico di Castellaneta, Aglianico di Lapio, Aglianico di Taurasi, Aglianico Femminile, Aglianico Liscio, Aglianico Mascolino, Aglianico Nero, Aglianico Noir, Aglianico Pannarano, Aglianico Trignarulo, Aglianico Tringarulo, Aglianico Verase, Aglianico Zerpoluso, Aglianico Zerpuloso, Aglianicone, Aglianicuccia, Agliano, Agliantica, Agliatica, Agliatico, Agnanico, Agnanico di Castellaneta, Alianiko, Cascavoglia, Cassano, Cerasole, Ellanico, Ellenica, Ellenico, Fiano Rosso, Fresella, Gagliano, Gesualdo, Ghiandara, Ghianna, Ghiannara, Glianica, Gnanica, Gnanico, Granica, Granico, Hellanica, Malvasia, Olivella, Olivella di San Cosmo, Pie di Colombo, Prie Blanc, Ruopolo, Spriema, Tintora, Tintora di Cerinola, Tringarulo, Uva Aglianica, Uva Castellaneta, Uva dei Cani, Uva di Castellaneta, Uva Nera, Zuccherina.

<doc id="1076595" wikidata="Q1332961" url="?curid=1076595" title="John O'Brien (soccer)">
<text>Jonathan Patrick O&#x27;Brien (born August 29, 1977) is an American former soccer player. After retiring, he pursued a career in psychology.

O&#x27;Brien was one of the first Americans to earn a starting spot with a major European team, with Ajax Amsterdam in the late 1990s. At the peak of his career, United States national teammate Landon Donovan called O&#x27;Brien the &quot;best soccer player in the USA.&quot;

==Club career==
O&#x27;Brien grew up in Playa del Rey, California and attended Brentwood School. After being brought to attention of youth director Co Adriaanse, he had his first trial with Ajax at the age of 14 and signed an amateur contract with the Dutch giants in 1994 as a 17-year-old. After two years on their youth teams, Ajax offered O&#x27;Brien a professional contract in 1998. He spent the 1998–99 season on loan to FC Utrecht and made his Ajax debut in 1999. He became a regular for the team, usually playing at left back, winning the Eredivisie in 2002 and 2004.

Unfortunately, chronic injuries limited O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s playing time. He left Ajax for ADO Den Haag in February 2005. After one injury-riddled season, in which he only played three games for the club, O&#x27;Brien came to MLS for the first time, to sign with hometown club Chivas USA. O&#x27;Brien played only one game with Chivas before suffering an injury with the U.S. national team during the 2006 World Cup, and was released by the club following the 2006 season.

O&#x27;Brien stated that he was done playing in an interview on June 11, 2008.

==International career==
With the United States, O&#x27;Brien earned his first cap against Austria on April 22, 1998, but was an alternate for the U.S. squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He played in the 2000 Summer Olympics, helping to lead the U.S. to a fourth-place finish. O&#x27;Brien became a regular with the senior team under Bruce Arena, and came into his own at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Playing in defensive midfield, he scored the opener in the 3–2 win over Portugal, assisted on Clint Mathis&#x27; goal against South Korea, and played every minute of every game for the United States.

Four years later, O&#x27;Brien was named to the U.S. roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. On June 12, 2006, he played the second half of the U.S.&#x27;s opening game against the Czech Republic, albeit with a nagging injury, which kept him out for the duration of the tournament.

==Personal life==
O’ Brien lives with his wife, son, and daughter near Boulder, Colorado. After retiring from soccer, O’Brien returned to college and completed a doctorate in clinical psychology from Alliant International University. Dr. O’Brien has two separate practices, one providing mental health counseling to the general public and one working as a sports psychologist.

<text>Pentridge is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Sixpenny Handley and Pentridge, in the Dorset district, in the ceremonial county of Dorset, England, lying in the north-east of the county. It is situated on the edge of Cranborne Chase down a dead-end minor lane just south of the A354 road between the towns of Blandford Forum (ten miles to the south-west) and Salisbury (twelve miles to the northeast). In 2001 the parish had a population of 215. The civil parish was abolished on 1 April 2015 and merged with Sixpenny Handley to form &quot;Sixpenny Handley and Pentridge&quot;.

The village name derives from the Celtic &quot;pen&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;) and &quot;twrch&quot; (&quot;boar&quot;), and thus means &quot;hill of the wild boar&quot;; its existence was first recorded (as &quot;Pentric&quot;) in the eighth century, eighty years before the birth of Alfred the Great.

The village is located amongst many Neolithic, Roman and Saxon earthworks, notably Bokerley Dyke, a long defensive ditch which was dug by the Romano-British to keep out the Saxon invaders.

Nearby is Pentridge Hill, formed by a band of more resistant chalk than the surrounding land.

==Blagdon Hill==
Approximately 2 km east of Pentridge is Blagdon Hill. On 17 January 1947, Mr.A.L.Parke of Salisbury reported that the round barrows on this hill had been recently &quot;trenched&quot; and a grave was opened. He supposed it to be the main interment, it &quot;being situated in a hole scooped in the solid chalk&quot;. He further stated that &quot;a few sherds of a well baked urn were found&quot; and &quot;fragments of burnt bone and charcoal accompanied&quot; the urn.

<text>Piddlehinton is a village and civil parish in west Dorset, England, situated in the Piddle valley north of Dorchester. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 403. Piddlehinton formerly constituted a liberty containing only the parish itself.

The local schools are Piddle Valley First School, St Mary&#x27;s Middle School in Puddletown, The Thomas Hardye School and Dorset Studio School in Dorchester, members of the DASP group. The village has one public house called The Thimble, the village has recently made a shop in the village not far from the Thimble inn public house The nearest shop is in Piddletrenthide. St Mary&#x27;s Piddlehinton is the local church. A microbrewery—the Dorset Piddle Brewery—was established in Piddlehinton in 2008 and produces 300 gallons of ale every week.

During the build-up to D-Day the US Army operated from an airstrip in Piddlehinton using Piper L-4 Grasshoppers of the 62nd Armed Field Artillery Battalion. The exact location of the airstrip in Piddlehinton is unknown.

Piddlehinton is at the southern end of the Piddle Valley electoral ward, which extends north up the valley to Buckland Newton and had a population of 1,988 in the 2011 census.

Piddlehinton run two adult football teams, which both play in the Dorset Football League. The First XI are in division 2, whilst the reserves are in division 3. The reserves are the current holders of Dorset Division 4, after winning the league in the 2017/2018 season.

<doc id="1076614" wikidata="Q6778293" url="?curid=1076614" title="Marvin Benard">
<text>Marvin Larry Benard (born January 20, 1970) is a Nicaraguan professional baseball manager and former outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants. He has also managed the Nicaraguan national team as well as Gigantes de Rivas in the 2024 Caribbean Series

==Personal life==

Benard moved to Los Angeles with his mother and father when he was 12. After a stellar prep career at Bell High School, he attended El Camino College (Torrance, CA) freshman year. After his Head Coach Tom Hicks stepped down, Benard transferred to L.A. Harbor Junior College in Wilmington, Calif., then Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho.

His son, Isaac, was drafted by the Tampa Bay Rays in the 23rd round of the 2016 Amateur Draft and was a member of the Princeton Rays in the Appalachian League, where he hit .255 with 3 home runs and 3 stolen bases in 110 at-bats.

He is the cousin of actor, Maurice Benard.

==Major League career==

Benard played with the San Francisco Giants from 1995 to 2003. He was a starter from 1999–2001, and played most of the 1996 season due to an injury to Glenallen Hill. He won the 1999 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. Despite a disappointing postseason performance in 2000, Marvin had one of the most memorable hits of series, driving in Ellis Burks with an RBI single in Game 3 of the 2000 National League Division Series.

Benard had above-average power for a leadoff hitter. A notorious first-pitch hitter prone to striking out, Benard had good bat speed and could steal bases, though he was caught stealing 29% of the time over the course of his career. He played all three outfield positions, mostly as a center fielder. As a pinch hitter, he had a career .267 batting average. Benard hit the final San Francisco Giants home run in the history of Candlestick Park, which came in the first inning of the Giants&#x27; eventual 9-4 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.

After becoming a free agent after the 2003 season, Benard agreed to a minor-league contract with the Chicago White Sox but was released before the season began and signed with the Toronto Blue Jays. He was released after one season with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, hitting .211 with four homers and 18 RBI in 33 games.

== Post-retirement ==
On April 11, 2010, Benard admitted to using steroids during the 2002 season in which the Giants reached the World Series.

=== Coaching career ===
Benard was employed as a hitting coach for the San Diego Padres&#x27; short-season Class A Northwest League affiliate, the Tri-City Dust Devils, for the 2015 season. In 2016 he managed the Nicaragua national baseball team. He is currently employed as a color commentator for the Giants&#x27; Spanish-language radio broadcasts, working road games alongside Erwin Higueros.

Benard managed Gigantes de Rivas, champions of the 2023–24 Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League, at the 2024 Caribbean Series (taking over from Germán Mesa). He drew criticism after making comments criticizing the heart of his team, saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to get in trouble for saying this... the Nicaraguan baseball player is a conformist. I try to motivate them, but they can&#x27;t get it out of their heads.&quot; The Nicaraguan team finished the tournament in last place with a 0–6 record, being eliminated in the first round.

<doc id="1076615" wikidata="Q2263729" url="?curid=1076615" title="The Road to Reality">
<text>The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe is a book on modern physics by the British mathematical physicist Roger Penrose, published in 2004. It covers the basics of the Standard Model of particle physics, discussing general relativity and quantum mechanics, and discusses the possible unification of these two theories.

==Overview==
The book discusses the physical world. Many fields that 19th century scientists believed were separate, such as electricity and magnetism, are aspects of more fundamental properties. Some texts, both popular and university level, introduce these topics as separate concepts, and then reveal their combination much later. &quot;The Road to Reality&quot; reverses this process, first expounding the underlying mathematics of space–time, then showing how electromagnetism and other phenomena fall out fully formed.

The book is just over 1100 pages, of which the first 383 are dedicated to mathematics—Penrose&#x27;s goal is to acquaint inquisitive readers with the mathematical tools needed to understand the remainder of the book in depth. Physics enters the discussion on page 383 with the topic of spacetime. From there it moves on to fields in spacetime, deriving the classical electrical and magnetic forces from first principles; that is, if one lives in spacetime of a particular sort, these fields develop naturally as a consequence. Energy and conservation laws appear in the discussion of Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, before moving on to a full discussion of quantum physics, particle theory and quantum field theory. A discussion of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics is given a full chapter; superstrings are given a chapter near the end of the book, as are loop gravity and twistor theory. The book ends with an exploration of other theories and possible ways forward.

The final chapters reflect Penrose&#x27;s personal perspective, which differs in some respects from what he regards as the current fashion among theoretical physicists. He is skeptical about string theory, to which he prefers loop quantum gravity. He is optimistic about his own approach, twistor theory. He also holds some controversial views about the role of consciousness in physics, as laid out in his earlier books (see &quot;Shadows of the Mind&quot;).

<text>Piddletrenthide () is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. The village lies on the small River Piddle in a valley on the dip slope of the Dorset Downs, north of Dorchester. In the 2011 census the parish—which includes the small village of Plush to the northeast and the hamlet of White Lackington to the south—had 323 dwellings, 290 households and a population of 647.

==Toponymy==
The unusual name of the village is derived from its position on the River Piddle, combined with it having been assessed for thirty hides in the Domesday Book. The name sometimes prompts amusement and discussion, and references have been made to it in the &quot;TV Times&quot; (25 April – 1 May 1970), &quot;The Times&quot; (a lengthy correspondence in 1974, then again on 27 March 1999), &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ( 22 December 2002 and 25 September 2005), and &quot;The Guardian&quot; (8 May 2004).

==History==
In 1086 in the Domesday Book Piddletrenthide was recorded as &quot;Pidrie&quot;; it had 70 households, 17 ploughlands, of meadow, three mills and a taxable value of 30 geld units. It was in Cerne, Totcombe and Modbury Hundred and the tenant-in-chief was Winchester Abbey. The manor&#x27;s estate was one of the largest in the county.

A Benedictine cell (i.e., a very small monastic establishment) existed here in the Middle Ages. Its date of foundation is unknown. It was dissolved in 1354, and its chapel demolished shortly after 1382. There are no physical remains and its location within the parish is unknown.

Piddletrenthide&#x27;s common arable fields were enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1817.

In 1933 Piddletrenthide parish was enlarged by to include the small village and tithing of Plush, which previously had been a detached part of the parish of Buckland Newton a few miles to the north.

===All Saints parish church===
All Saints parish church, situated on the northern edge of the village, has a claim to being one of the finest village churches in Dorset. The south doorway and piers of the chancel arch are Norman; the doorway inside the porch features typically Norman zigzag decoration. The tower dates from 1485 and has bell openings, pinnacles and gargoyles. The nave and aisles are also 15th-century. Over the west door of the church-tower is the Latin inscription:
&quot;Est pydeltrenth villa in dorsedie comitatu Nascitur in illa quam rexit Vicariatu 1487&quot;. The inscription translates as: &quot;It is in Piddletrenthide, a town in Dorset [where] he was born [and] is Vicar, 1487.&quot;

In 1852 the building was restored, and the walls raised by John Hicks, brother of the then vicar. Hicks went on to restore and build more than 27 churches in the county. Ewan Christian redesigned the chancel in 1880. There are Victorian memorials. In the churchyard are two headstones marking the graves of members of the Durbefield family, a family later referenced by Thomas Hardy in his 1891 novel &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;.

The church is part of the benefice of the Piddle Valley, Hilton, Cheselbourne and Melcombe Horsey.

==Geography==
Piddletrenthide civil parish covers in the Dorset Downs in central Dorset. The parish comprises two distinct settlements: Piddletrenthide village in the valley of the River Piddle, and the smaller Plush in a side valley to the northeast. Piddletrenthide village is divided into three tithings: Higher, Middle and Lower. The church and manor house are the higher tithing, a group of cottages form the middle, and the third is known as White Lackington, which is a little separate from the other parts and is close to neighbouring Piddlehinton. White Lackington is between about above sea-level, with the rest of Piddletrenthide village being between about and Plush between about .

At the northern end of the village, reached by a footpath from the Poachers Inn, is Morning Well (or Mourning Well), where several springs feed into the River Piddle. In his book &quot;Portrait of Dorset&quot; Ralph Wightman described it as where &quot;springs bubble out of the base of a steep wooded hill into a shady pool... It is an enchanted place, raising memories of holy wells and pagan groves.&quot;

==Culture, art and media==
Scrumpy and Western artist Trevor Crozier wrote a song entitled &quot;The Piddletrenthide Jug Band&quot; for Dorset folk group The Yetties.

Piddletrenthide is the hometown of Jem Kellaway, one of the main protagonists in Tracy Chevalier&#x27;s 18th-century-set novel &quot;Burning Bright&quot;.

In the 21st century the tenor John Hudson, formerly a principal with English National Opera, has performed in a series of annual concerts at All Saints parish church, with support provided by other musicians with local connections.

==Notable people==
The BBC Radio broadcaster Ralph Wightman (1901–1971), English lecturer, journalist, author, and radio and television broadcaster, came from here. Wightman was the model for Kenneth Williams&#x27; country character Arthur Fallowfield and was noted in his radio broadcasts for his fine Dorset accent.

<text>Pimperne ( ) is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated on Cranborne Chase northeast of the town of Blandford Forum. At the 2011 census the civil parish had 478 households and a population of 1109.

The first records of Pimperne are in Domesday Book in the late 11th century, where it is recorded as &quot;Pinpre&quot;, but it is believed that the village goes back to Anglo-Saxon times. A Bronze Age settlement was discovered in the barrows to the north of the village. A house found there has been used as the model for all Bronze Age houses, including the reconstruction at Butser Ancient Farm, Hampshire. The parish church of St Peter was rebuilt by Lord Portman of Bryanston in 1872–4, though some Norman features from the previous building, such as the font and chancel arch, were retained.

Pimperne is centred on its two pubs and the parish church. Other amenities are found in nearby Blandford Forum.

Pimperne parish is within the Cranborne Chase electoral ward, which extends north eastwards through Tarrant Hinton to Ashmore. The ward had a population of 1,993 in the 2011 census and is part of the constituency of North Dorset, which is currently represented in the UK parliament by the Conservative Simon Hoare.

<doc id="1076639" wikidata="Q710973" url="?curid=1076639" title="Jan Wong">
<text>Jan Wong (; born August 1952) is a Canadian academic, journalist, and writer. Wong worked for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, serving as Beijing correspondent from 1988 to 1994, when she returned to write from Canada. At the turn of the 21st century she was known for her &quot;Globe&quot; column &quot;Lunch with Jan Wong&quot;. She covered the Dawson College shooting in 2006 and her article was attacked by the public and even the prime minister. &quot;The Globe&quot; management did not back her and this caused her to have a bout of clinical depression. She was fired by the newspaper in 2007 without cause, but she had to sign a confidentiality agreement about the terms of the settlement. In 2012 she self-published the book &quot;Out of the blue&quot; about her time at the paper. In late 2014, &quot;The Globe&quot; successfully sued her for breaching the confidentiality agreement and she was ordered by the court to repay her settlement and court costs. After 2008, she took on various jobs including being a guest host on CBC Radio, and author of several best selling books. Into the 2020s she is employed as a professor at St. Thomas University in Fredericton, New Brunswick. She is married with two adult children and resides in both Toronto and Fredericton.

==Life after the Cultural Revolution==
Wong was born in Montreal in August 1952. She is the daughter of Montreal businessman Bill Wong, founder of Bill Wong&#x27;s buffet in 1963, and earlier of the House of Wong which was the city&#x27;s first Chinese restaurant to open outside Chinatown. Towards the end of the Cultural Revolution period, she left McGill University and flew to China. As a committed Maoist, she became one of two foreign college students permitted to study at Beijing University. While at Beijing she denounced Yin Luoyi, a trusting fellow student who had sought her help to escape communist China to the West. The student was subsequently shamed and expelled. &quot;She suffered a lot ... she was sent to the countryside for hard labour. When she came back, she fought hard to clear her name.&quot; Long after, having returned for a second visit after her own return to the West, and having eventually found Yin Luoyi again, Wong took comfort in learning she had not been her confidante&#x27;s only traitor, and that she did not express anger. Wong wrote another book, and did interviews on her own experience.

Wong met her future husband Norman Shulman while studying in China and married him in 1976. The couple have two sons: Ben (b. 1991) and Sam (b. 1993). Shulman, an American draft dodger of the Vietnam Era, had joined his father Jack Shulman in China and remained there when Jack and his wife Ruth left China during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. Shulman worked as a text-polisher for Chinese propaganda magazine &quot;China Reconstructs&quot;.

==Journalism career==
In the late 1970s, Wong began her career in journalism when she was hired as a news assistant by Fox Butterfield, China correspondent for the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Wong became tired of Party ideology and returned to Canada from Beijing. She then studied journalism at Columbia, receiving a master&#x27;s degree, and found work with the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; before joining the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; as a business reporter.

In 1988, the paper sent her to China where she worked for six years as its foreign correspondent, among other things covering the Tiananmen Massacre. She later chronicled her Chinese experience in a book, &quot;Red China Blues&quot;, which was promptly banned in China. After a return trip in the late nineties, she produced a second book entitled &quot;Jan Wong&#x27;s China&quot;, a somewhat less personal account of social life, the economy, and politics in modern-day China.

==After China==
From 1996 to 2002, Wong was best known for her &quot;Lunch with...&quot; column in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, in which she had lunch with a celebrity, who was usually but not always Canadian. Her &quot;Lunch&quot; columns were often noted for publishing her theatrical take on the private, titillating side of her lunch companions — Margaret Atwood was depicted as a prickly diva who refused to eat her lunch because she was unhappy with the table, and Gene Simmons revealed the size of his penis. In one of her most famous &quot;Lunch&quot; columns, Wong took a homeless woman to lunch.

After &quot;Lunch with Jan Wong&quot; was retired in 2002, Wong moved on to other journalistic roles with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. In 2006, Wong attracted attention by imitating the work of Barbara Ehrenreich and going undercover as a cleaning lady in wealthy Toronto homes. While employed by the Globe and Mail as a reporter, Jan Wong impersonated a maid, and then wrote about her experiences in a five-part series on low-income living. The newspaper published the stories in the spring of 2006. Members of a Markham family sued the newspaper and Wong, alleging they suffered &quot;significant embarrassment and mental distress.&quot;

==Dawson College controversy==
Wong published the article &quot;Get under the desk&quot; in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; on 16 September 2006. In it, she drew a link between the actions of Marc Lépine, Valery Fabrikant, and Kimveer Gill, perpetrators of the shootings of the École Polytechnique, Concordia University, and Dawson College, respectively; and the existence in Quebec of bill 101, the &quot;decades-long linguistic struggle&quot;. She implied a relation between the fact that the three were not old-stock Québécois and the murders they committed, since they were, according to Wong, alienated in a Quebec society concerned with &quot;racial purity&quot;.

Public outcry and political condemnation, and publicity soon followed. The Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society lodged a complaint to the Quebec Press Council. Quebec Premier Jean Charest called the article a &quot;disgrace,&quot; which demonstrated a profound incomprehension of Quebec society and that Wong should apologize to all Québécois. Prime Minister Stephen Harper denounced Wong&#x27;s article in a letter to the newspaper published on 21 September 2006 saying that her &quot;argument is patently absurd and without foundation.&quot; On 20 September, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously passed a motion, by Liberal Party Member of Parliament Denis Coderre, requesting an apology for the column.

A few days later, &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; editor Edward Greenspon responded to the controversy. He wrote a column stating that Wong&#x27;s opinion should not have been included in a news piece. A separate article, labelled as opinion, should have been published with her &quot;pure laine&quot; thesis. Wong viewed this as a betrayal by her employer, as Greenspon had previously read and approved her story.

Wong descended into a long period of deep depression following the controversy and, unable to work, went on sick leave. The &quot;Globe&quot; ordered her back to work in 2007, and withdrew her sick pay for the summer and autumn of that year. They ultimately terminated her on 4 June 2007. That provoked her to file a grievance that lead to a confidential settlement, ordered by a labour board arbiter, with a lump sum payment of $209,912 – two years salary – plus the denied sick leave pay. According to Wong: &quot;I wrote a feature story that sparked a political backlash, my employers failed to support me and later silenced me, and after I became clinically depressed, they fired me.&quot;

==Recent work==
In the 2009–2010 season, Wong was an occasional Friday guest radio host on CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;The Current&quot;. In 2010, Wong was Visiting Irving Chair of Journalism at St. Thomas University in Fredericton, New Brunswick, and is currently an associate professor there.

Her fifth book, &quot;Out of the Blue: A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and, Yes, Happiness&quot;, is a memoir of her experience with clinical depression in which Jan Wong describes in detail the backlash she received immediately after her article appeared; and how the Globe and Mail management, in her view, abandoned her in the face of a torrent of negative reaction from all sides. She found the &#x27;exact moment I began my descent into depression&#x27; when she was shattered by racial attack. This book was self-published after Doubleday, the publisher of her previous books, pulled out mere days before print although Doubleday denied any legal interference from &quot;The Globe&quot;; it was released May 5, 2012, and became an instant bestseller.

The &quot;Globe&quot; alleged that passages in the book violated a confidentiality agreement that was part of the settlement of Wong&#x27;s grievance with the newspaper. An arbitrator&#x27;s ruling in July 2013 ordered Wong to return her severance payment to the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;. Wong challenged the arbitrator&#x27;s decision in an Ontario court in 2014. In November 2014, the Ontario Superior Court upheld the arbitration award requiring Wong to repay the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; her $209,000 termination settlement and also ordered her to pay $15,000 in legal fees to both the Globe and Mail and the union.

Her latest book is &quot;Apron Strings: Navigating Food And Family In France, Italy, And China&quot;. Published in September, 2017, it was named a must-read book by both the CBC and the Toronto Star. As Chris Nuttall-Smith (top chef Canada) wrote: &quot;a sharp-minded — and famously sharp-tongued — reporter drags her fully grown, chef-trained son on a homestay cooking tour of France, Italy, and China. What could possibly not go wrong? Inquisitive, caustic, delicious, and can’t-look-away entertaining, this is Jan Wong at the peak of her powers.&quot;

<doc id="1076642" wikidata="Q227525" url="?curid=1076642" title="36 Crazyfists">
<text>36 Crazyfists was an American metalcore band formed in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1994. The band&#x27;s name comes from the Hong Kong martial arts film &quot;The 36 Crazy Fists&quot; (1977). To date they have released eight studio albums.

==History==

===Early years (1994–1999)===
36 Crazyfists formed in 1994 in Anchorage, Alaska. The original members were vocalist Brock Lindow, guitarists Steve Holt and Ryan Brownell, bassist JD Stuart, and drummer Thomas Noonan. Holt is from Kenai, and Lindow spent much of his childhood there. Lindow, Brownell, Stuart, and Noonan are all from Anchorage.

36CF originated from the remains of three local bands: Grin, Hessian, and Broke. JD Stuart played in Grin, Brock Lindow in Hessian, and Steve Holt and Ryan Brownell in Broke. One of the circumstances influencing the formation of 36CF was the murder of Broke&#x27;s drummer Duane Monsen. On January 28, 1994, Broke played a set at the Underground bar in Anchorage. Later that night there was an altercation between Monsen and a drunken soldier who was stationed locally at Ft. Richardson. According to an article in the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot;, Monsen tried to apologize and defuse the situation, but was fatally stabbed in the neck. He was 27 years old. In the wake of this tragedy, Monsen&#x27;s friends organized a benefit concert to raise funds for his family. Monsen&#x27;s protégé Thomas Noonan played the drums at this show and the musicians decided that they were an excellent match. Since that time the members have considered it the de facto first 36CF performance.

36CF released their first EP, &quot;Boss Buckle&quot;, in 1995 on cassette. At that time the band&#x27;s local popularity was rising quickly and the tape became a rarity, with the entire printing sold or given away as promos. On May 13, 1996, 36CF opened for Primus at Egan Center in Anchorage. This concert was particularly interesting in a few ways. This was one of the first times 36CF performed before an audience of thousands, though many locals were already familiar with the band&#x27;s music. This was also the last show of Primus&#x27; Punchbowl tour and the last show for drummer Tim Alexander before his first hiatus from Primus.

36CF were planning to relocate to Tacoma, Washington, in search of professional recording contracts when another tragedy struck. On June 16, 1996, JD Stuart died in a car collision at age 23. This was a huge loss for the band because Stuart&#x27;s musicianship and showmanship were a large part of the band&#x27;s appeal. Nevertheless, the band persevered. At that time, Brownell retired from the band and the remaining members recruited bassist Mick Whitney, who is also from Anchorage. 36CF then relocated to the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area.

In 1997, the band released their second EP, &quot;Suffer Tree&quot;, on cassette. Later that year they self-published full-length demo CD, &quot;In the Skin&quot;. They next relocated to Portland, Oregon. In 1999, they released a four-song demo that, through their friends in Skinlab, ended up in the hands of Monte Conner, A&amp;R rep at Roadrunner Records. In an interview with &quot;AntiHero Magazine&quot;, vocalist Brock Lindow states that the demo was produced by Steev Esquivel and Scott Sargeant of Skinlab.

===Roadrunner Records years (2000–2007)===

Signed by Roadrunner Records in 2000, the band recorded their major debut album &quot;Bitterness the Star&quot; which was released on April 4, 2002. In support of its release they toured with bands such as Candiria, God Forbid, Chimaira, Diecast, and Hotwire. After touring the United States, they headed off to Europe to begin the European Road Rage Tour with Killswitch Engage and Five Pointe O.

The band re-emerged two years later, on March 16, 2004 with their second album &quot;A Snow Capped Romance&quot; which was produced by James Paul Wisner (who also produced albums for bands like Dashboard Confessional and As Friends Rust). They toured intensely behind the record (playing shows with acts like Killswitch Engage and Poison the Well) through December, taking two months off before beginning the work on their next album.

36 Crazyfists entered the studio with producer Sal Villanueva (who had worked with Thursday and Taking Back Sunday) in October 2005 to commence recording their third album &quot;Rest Inside the Flames&quot;, which was released across Europe on June 12, 2006. Ultimately, Roadrunner decided not to release the album in North America. A deal with DRT Entertainment was later struck, and the album received a belated release on November 7, 2006.

The album was a success in the UK, with &quot;Rest Inside the Flames&quot; debuting at No. 71 on the UK Albums Chart, and reaching No. 2 on the BBC&#x27;s Rock Albums chart. However, the album only sold 1,858 copies in the US during its first week of release.

The band started an extensive UK tour, supported by Twelve Tribes and Your Rigamortus on April 1, 2007, where they played at 26 venues across the country.

===Ferret Music years (2007–2014)===

In May 2008 the band released &quot;The Tide and Its Takers&quot; on Ferret Music. They continue to play annually at the Summer Meltdown Festival in Anchorage, Alaska, except for 2008, when they were on tour with the first Annual Rockstar Mayhem Festival. Shortly after the Mayhem tour, bassist Mick Whitney left the band and was replaced by Brett Makowski.

36 Crazyfists filmed their show of January 9, 2009, in Anchorage, Alaska, for their first live DVD, &quot;Underneath a Northern Sky&quot;, released in October 2009.

The album &quot;Collisions and Castaways&quot; was released in the US by Ferret Music on July 27, 2010 and a day earlier in the rest of the world via Roadrunner Records. The album features guest appearances by Twelve Tribes frontman Adam Jackson (who also featured on their 2008 album &quot;The Tide and Its Takers&quot;), Raithon Clay of Plans to Make Perfect, and Brandon Davis from Across the Sun. Production duties for the album were handled by band guitarist Steve Holt and sport mixing from Andy Sneap.

The band played a variety of European festivals in June, including the UK Download Festival. 36 Crazyfists returned to the US in July to tour with Fear Factory, After the Burial, Divine Heresy, and Baptized in Blood.

In the UK the band re-signed with Roadrunner Records. &quot;Collisions and Castaways&quot; was released a day earlier on July 26.

===&quot;Time and Trauma,&quot; &quot;Lanterns&quot; and lineup changes (2014–2021)===
During the UK tour at the end of 2013, the band debuted the title track for their seventh studio album, &quot;Time and Trauma&quot;. By mid-2014 the band had completed work on their new album for an early 2015 release. A listening party for the CD was held on July 24 at Pioneer Bar in Anchorage. Their seventh studio album &quot;Time and Trauma&quot; was released on February 17, 2015, via Spinefarm Records. Spinefarm Records also released the single &quot;Also Am I&quot; on their SoundCloud page.

On September 29, 2017, the band released their eighth studio album &quot;Lanterns&quot; on Spinefarm Records.

On March 19, 2021, Steven Holt posted on his personal Facebook profile in which he suggested that the band has disbanded. However, there has been no official confirmation, and less than two weeks prior, vocalist Brock Lindow confirmed that a new album was about half written. However, a few weeks later, it was reported that the band was continuing without Lindow, though there was also no official confirmation.

Lindow has since formed a new band called Paradise Slaves, who released their debut single &quot;A Fever To Defeat&quot; on October 30, 2024.

==Musical style==
36 Crazyfists have been described as metalcore, alternative metal and post-hardcore, as well as nu metal earlier in their career. According to Adam Rees of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, 36 Crazyfists occupies &quot;a territory between jarring metalcore, nu metal&#x27;s groove and the anthemic charge of post-hardcore&quot;.

<doc id="1076644" wikidata="Q1501385" url="?curid=1076644" title="Gene Fitzgerald">
<text>Eugene Fitzgerald (21 August 1932 – 14 December 2007) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Finance from 1980 to 1981, Minister for the Public Service from 1980 to 1981 to March 1982 to December 1982, Minister for Labour from 1977 to 1980 and March 1982 to December 1982. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1972 to 1987. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1984 to 1994.

Gene Fitzgerald was born in Crookstown, County Cork in August 1932. He was educated nearby in Cork at the Presentation Brothers College. Fitzgerald was first elected to Dáil Éireann in a by-election in 1972. He remained as a Fianna Fáil TD for the constituency of Cork South-Central for 15 years. He was also involved in local politics, serving as a member of Cork County Council from 1974 until 1977. Fitzgerald was also vice-president of the Cork County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association.

Fitzgerald was first appointed to the Irish Government in 1977 when he became minister for labour under Jack Lynch. He backed George Colley in the 1979 Fianna Fáil leadership election but retained his office under the eventual victor, Charles Haughey. His appointment as minister for finance in 1980 caused some political commentators to be taken aback, particularly because of his political inexperience and also Fitzgerald had never been named as a possible finance minister. From then on he backed Haughey in the leadership heaves of 1982. In Haughey&#x27;s second government, Fitzgerald returned to the position of minister for labour.

Fitzgerald contested the 1984 European election in the Munster constituency and won a seat. He remained a TD until he stood down at the 1987 general election to concentrate on European politics instead of national politics. He was re-elected as an MEP in the 1989 elections. Fitzgerald retired from public office at the 1994 election, although he remained involved in the Fianna Fáil party as a treasurer and subsequently as honorary secretary.

<text>Samuel Marchbanks is a fictional character who wrote editorials for the &quot;Peterborough Examiner&quot; newspaper in the small city of Peterborough, Ontario, northeast of Toronto, during the middle of the 20th century.

Marchbanks was, in fact, a pseudonym used by Canadian novelist, playwright, critic, journalist, and professor Robertson Davies during his tenure as editor of the newspaper. Marchbanks is described as witty, cantankerous, and determinedly individualistic.

Three books of Marchbanks&#x27; writings have been published, supposedly with Davies as editor. The metafictional pretence of there being two separate individuals spills over into the footnotes, where disagreements between Marchbanks and Davies are evident.

The Marchbanks books include &quot;The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; (published in 1947), &quot;The Table Talk of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; (published in 1949), and &quot;Samuel Marchbanks&#x27; Almanack&quot; (published in 1967). In 1985 an omnibus of the three previous Marchbanks books, &quot;The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks&quot;, was published with new notes by the author, or more correctly, by the editor (Davies).

<text>The Forte di Belvedere or Fortezza di Santa Maria in San Giorgio del Belvedere (often called simply Belvedere) is a fortification in Florence, Italy.

==History==
Forte Belvedere is the second and largest fortress to be built in Florence, Italy.

It was designed and built by Bernardo Buontalenti over a five-year period, between 1590 and 1595, by order of Grand Duke Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici.

Fortifications were significant in the 16th century and a demonstration of a city&#x27;s wealth and capabilities.

The fortress is located in the southern hills of the Arno River and on the highest hill of the Boboli Gardens. It had long been considered one of the weakest spots in the city&#x27;s defenses, a sensation that only increased with the invention of artillery in the early modern era. From a military point of view, the fortress is located at the most strategic point, overlooking almost the entire city and surrounding area. Due to the nature of Renaissance warfare, forts were paramount in a city&#x27;s defensive strategy.

The Fort served several purposes. Most importantly it was designed to protect the centre of government in Florence and the Medici family if the city came under attack. It was also constructed to protect the Pitti Palace, Oltrarno district and south end of the city. In addition to this, the fort served as a garrison for troops for over 100 years after its completion.

Galileo Galilei used Forte Belvedere for his astronomical observations and after he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633, he lived not far from the fort in Villa Arcetri.

==Architecture==
The design of the fort reflects both Italian Renaissance and military architecture.

Buontalenti&#x27;s application of contemporary fortification principles is evident throughout the design. The walls are built at angles that allow for all the walls to be seen by another wall, allowing for cross fire to assist in protecting the other walls.

The fort was connected to the Palazzo Vecchio via the Vasari Corridor. There were also passages connecting it to the Pitti Palace and paths leading through the Boboli Gardens.
Frescos seen in the Palazzo Vecchio show an earlier version of the fort, built of earth and stone gabions.

The design of the fort demonstrated the power and prestige of the Medici Family.

The opulent villa at the centre of the fortress, Palazzina di Belvedere, predates the fort and was designed by Bartolomeo Ammannati around 1570. As the fort&#x27;s secondary purpose was to house the Grand Duke in times of unrest or epidemic, it was built as a comfortable, luxurious palace. It did not adhere to military purposes, housing the Medici family&#x27;s treasures in the bottom of a well inside the building.

==Contemporary use==
Today the Forte di Belvedere constitutes a monumental, historic, artistic and environmental focal point, offering visitors sweeping views of Florence and an insight to Renaissance architecture and military activity.

After five years of renovation to improve its safety features, the fort reopened to visitors in July 2013.

It serves primarily as a tourist attraction and exhibition centre, hosting elite events and artistic exhibitions year round.

On May 24, 2014, celebrity couple Kim Kardashian and Kanye West paid €300,000 to hire the fort as the venue for their lavish wedding.

<doc id="1076658" wikidata="Q1417808" url="?curid=1076658" title="Richie Ryan (politician)">
<text>Richard Ryan (27 February 1929 – 17 March 2019) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service from 1973 to 1977 and a Member of the European Court of Auditors from 1986 to 1989. He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1977 to 1986. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1959 to 1982.

==Background==
Ryan was born in Dublin in 1929. He was educated at Synge Street CBS, University College Dublin (UCD), where he studied economics and jurisprudence, and the Law Society of Ireland, subsequently qualifying as a solicitor. A formidable orator, at UCD he was auditor of the Literary and Historical Society (the L&amp;H) and subsequently of the Solicitors Apprentice Debating Society (1950), and won both societies&#x27; gold medals for debating. He served as an Honorary Vice-president of the L&amp;H.

After qualifying, Ryan worked for several solicitors&#x27; firms before establishing a private practice in Dame Street in Dublin, in which he remained an active partner until appointed to ministerial office in 1973.

==Politics==
He first held political office when he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for Dublin South-West in a 1959 by-election, and retained his seat until he retired at the February 1982 general election to concentrate on his European Parliament seat.

In opposition, Ryan served as Fine Gael Spokesperson on Health and Social Welfare (1966–1970) and on Foreign Affairs and Northern Ireland (1970–1973). During this period he was involved in several important pro bono legal cases, including the 1963 challenge in the High Court, and then, on appeal, in the Supreme Court of Ireland in 1964, by Gladys Ryan (no relation) on the constitutionality of the fluoridation of the water supply. While the court ruled against Gladys Ryan, the case remains a landmark, for it established the right to privacy under the Constitution of Ireland (or, perhaps more precisely, the right to bodily integrity under Article 40.3.1.). The case also raised a legal controversy, owing to the introduction by Justice Kenny of the concept of unenumerated rights. Other notable cases involving Richie Ryan include a challenge to the rules governing the drafting of constituency boundaries, and an unsuccessful attempt to randomise the order of candidates on ballot papers (owing to a preponderance of TDs with surnames from the first part of the alphabet).

Fine Gael came to power in a coalition with the Labour Party in 1973, and Ryan became Minister for Finance. He presided over a tough four years in the National Coalition under Liam Cosgrave, during the 1970s oil crisis when, in common with most Western economies, Ireland faced a significant recession. He was variously lampooned as &quot;Richie Ruin&quot; on the Irish satire show &quot;Hall&#x27;s Pictorial Weekly&quot;, and as &quot;Red Richie&quot; for his government&#x27;s introduction of a wealth tax. Following the 1977 general election Fine Gael was out of power, and Ryan once again became Spokesperson on Foreign Affairs.

Ryan also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in 1973 and from 1977 to 1979, being appointed to Ireland&#x27;s first delegation and third delegation. At the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, he was elected for the Dublin constituency and was re-elected in 1984, heading the poll on both occasions.

On being appointed to the European Court of Auditors in 1986, he resigned his seat and was succeeded by Chris O&#x27;Malley. He served as a member of the Court of Auditors from 1986 to 1994, being replaced by Barry Desmond. After retirement, he continued in several roles, including as a Commissioner of Irish Lights (until 2004) and a spell as Chairman of the Irish Red Cross in 1998.

He was the father of the economist and academic Cillian Ryan. He died on 17 March 2019, aged 90.

<text>The Granary Burying Ground in Massachusetts is the city of Boston&#x27;s third-oldest cemetery, founded in 1660 and located on Tremont Street. It is the burial location of Revolutionary War-era patriots, including Paul Revere, the five victims of the Boston Massacre, and three signers of the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and Robert Treat Paine. The cemetery has 2,345 grave-markers, but historians estimate that as many as 5,000 people are buried in it. The cemetery is adjacent to Park Street Church, behind the Boston Athenæum and immediately across from Suffolk University Law School. It is a site on Boston&#x27;s Freedom Trail. The cemetery&#x27;s Egyptian revival gate and fence were designed by architect Isaiah Rogers (1800–1869), who designed an identical gate for Newport&#x27;s Touro Cemetery.

==History==
The Burying Ground was the third cemetery established in the city of Boston and dates to 1660. The need for the site arose because the land set aside for the city&#x27;s first cemetery—King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground, located a block east—was insufficient to meet the city&#x27;s growing population. The area was known as the South Burying Ground until 1737, at which point it took on the name of the granary building which stood on the site of the present-day Park Street Church. In May 1830, trees were planted in the area and an attempt was made to change the name to &quot;Franklin Cemetery&quot; to honor the family of Benjamin Franklin, but the effort failed.

The Burying Ground was originally part of the Boston Common, which then encompassed the entire block. The southwest portion of the block was taken for public buildings two years after the cemetery was established, which included the Granary and a house of correction, and the north portion of the block was used for housing.

Tombs were initially placed near the back of the property. Puritan churches did not believe in religious icons or imagery, so the people of Boston used tombstones as an outlet for artistic expression of their beliefs about the afterlife. One of the most popular motifs was the &quot;Soul Effigy,&quot; a skull or &quot;death’s head&quot; with a wing on each side that was a representation of the soul flying to heaven after death. On May 15, 1717, a vote was passed by the town to enlarge the Burying Ground by taking part of the highway on the eastern side (now Tremont Street). The enlargement was carried out in 1720 when 15 tombs were created and assigned to a number of Boston families.

Eleven large European elms fronted it on Tremont Street. The elms were planted in 1762 by Major Adino Paddock and John Ballard and reached ten feet in circumference by 1856. The walk under the elms was known as &quot;Paddock&#x27;s Mall,&quot; while the rest of the grounds were devoid of any trees at all. The first major improvement was undertaken in 1830, when a number of trees were planted around the grounds. The property was improved again in 1840 by the construction of an iron fence on Tremont Street. The fence was designed by Boston architect Isaiah Rogers at a cost of $5,000, half paid by the city and half by public subscription. Rogers designed an identical Egyptian revival gateway for Newport&#x27;s Touro Cemetery.

In January 2009, a previously unknown crypt was discovered when a tourist on a self-guided tour through the cemetery fell through the ground into what appeared to be a stairway leading to a crypt. The stairway had been covered with a piece of slate which eventually gave way due to advanced age. (The tourist was not hurt, nor did she come into contact with any human remains.) The crypt is reported to be 8 by 12 feet and is structurally intact. It is possibly the resting place of Jonathan Armitage, a Boston selectman from 1732 to 1733. Officials from the City of Boston announced in May, 2011 a $300,000 refurbishment project designed to repair and restore the historic site, including widening paths in the cemetery and providing new observation sites: $125,000 will be provided by the Freedom Trail Foundation and the city will pay the rest.

==Memorials and monuments==
Prominently displayed in the Burying Ground is an obelisk erected in 1827 to the parents and relatives of Benjamin Franklin who was born in Boston and is buried in Philadelphia. Franklin&#x27;s father was Josiah Franklin, originally from Ecton, Northamptonshire, England, and his mother was Abiah, who was born in Nantucket and was Josiah&#x27;s second wife. Constructed of granite from the Bunker Hill Monument quarry, the obelisk was constructed to replace the original Franklin family gravestones which had been in poor condition. The new memorial was dedicated on 15 June 1827.

The second oldest memorial in the yard lies near the Franklin monument memorializing John Wakefield, aged 52 who died 18 June 1667. The reason(s) for the seven-year gap between the establishment of the burying ground and the oldest memorial are unknown. The oldest stone is that of the Neal Children, carved by the &#x27;Charlestown Carver&#x27; dating to 1666.

Near the Tremont Street entrance are interred the American casualties in the Boston Massacre which occurred 5 March 1770. The grave markers were moved during the 1800s to be in straight lines, to conform to nineteenth century ideas of order, as well as to allow for more modern groundskeeping (i.e., the lawn mower).

==Burials==

* Peter Boylston Adams (1738–1823), younger brother of second U.S. President John Adams and second cousin to Samuel Adams, he served as captain of the Braintree militia during the Revolutionary War. He was the older brother of Elihu Adams (1741 –1775), who fought as a minuteman on the Concord Green in 1775, but who died of dysentery while serving in the siege of Boston

<doc id="1076662" wikidata="Q336038" url="?curid=1076662" title="Wireless sensor network">
<text>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) refer to networks of spatially dispersed and dedicated sensors that monitor and record the physical conditions of the environment and forward the collected data to a central location. WSNs can measure environmental conditions such as temperature, sound, pollution levels, humidity and wind.

These are similar to wireless ad hoc networks in the sense that they rely on wireless connectivity and spontaneous formation of networks so that sensor data can be transported wirelessly. WSNs monitor physical conditions, such as temperature, sound, and pressure. Modern networks are bi-directional, both collecting data and enabling control of sensor activity.  The development of these networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance. Such networks are used in industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control and machine health monitoring and agriculture.

A WSN is built of &quot;nodes&quot; – from a few to hundreds or thousands, where each node is connected to other sensors. Each such node typically has several parts: a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or connection to an external antenna, a microcontroller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or an embedded form of energy harvesting. A sensor node might vary in size from a shoebox to (theoretically) a grain of dust, although microscopic dimensions have yet to be realized. Sensor node cost is similarly variable, ranging from a few to hundreds of dollars, depending on node sophistication. Size and cost constraints constrain resources such as energy, memory, computational speed and communications bandwidth. The topology of a WSN can vary from a simple star network to an advanced multi-hop wireless mesh network. Propagation can employ routing or flooding.

In computer science and telecommunications, wireless sensor networks are an active research area supporting many workshops and conferences, including International Workshop on Embedded Networked Sensors (EmNetS), IPSN, SenSys, MobiCom and EWSN. As of 2010, wireless sensor networks had deployed approximately 120million remote units worldwide.

==Application==
===Area monitoring===
Area monitoring is a common application of WSNs. In area monitoring, the WSN is deployed over a region where some phenomenon is to be monitored. A military example is the use of sensors to detect enemy intrusion; a civilian example is the geo-fencing of gas or oil pipelines.

===Health care monitoring===
There are several types of sensor networks for medical applications: implanted, wearable, and environment-embedded. Implantable medical devices are those that are inserted inside the human body. Wearable devices are used on the body surface of a human or just at close proximity of the user. Environment-embedded systems employ sensors contained in the environment. Possible applications include body position measurement, location of persons, overall monitoring of ill patients in hospitals and at home. Devices embedded in the environment track the physical state of a person for continuous health diagnosis, using as input the data from a network of depth cameras, a sensing floor, or other similar devices. Body-area networks can collect information about an individual&#x27;s health, fitness, and energy expenditure. In health care applications the privacy and authenticity of user data has prime importance. Especially due to the integration of sensor networks, with IoT, the user authentication becomes more challenging; however, a solution is presented in recent work.

===Habitat monitoring===
Wireless sensor networks have been used to monitor various species and habitats, beginning with the Great Duck Island Deployment, including marmots, cane toads in Australia and zebras in Kenya.

===Environmental/Earth sensing ===
There are many applications in monitoring environmental parameters, examples of which are given below. They share the extra challenges of harsh environments and reduced power supply.

====Air quality monitoring====
Experiments have shown that personal exposure to air pollution in cities can vary a lot. Therefore, it is of interest to have higher temporal and spatial resolution of pollutants and particulates. For research purposes, wireless sensor networks have been deployed to monitor the concentration of dangerous gases for citizens (e.g., in London). However, sensors for gases and particulate matter suffer from high unit-to-unit variability, cross-sensitivities, and (concept) drift. Moreover, the quality of data is currently insufficient for trustworthy decision-making, as field calibration leads to unreliable measurement results, and frequent recalibration might be required. A possible solution could be blind calibration or the usage of mobile references.

====Forest fire detection====
A network of Sensor Nodes can be installed in a forest to detect when a fire has started. The nodes can be equipped with sensors to measure temperature, humidity and gases which are produced by fire in the trees or vegetation. The early detection is crucial for a successful action of the firefighters; thanks to Wireless Sensor Networks, the fire brigade will be able to know when a fire is started and how it is spreading.

====Landslide detection====
A landslide detection system makes use of a wireless sensor network to detect the slight movements of soil and changes in various parameters that may occur before or during a landslide. Through the data gathered it may be possible to know the impending occurrence of landslides long before it actually happens.

====Water quality monitoring====
Water quality monitoring involves analyzing water properties in dams, rivers, lakes and oceans, as well as underground water reserves. The use of many wireless distributed sensors enables the creation of a more accurate map of the water status, and allows the permanent deployment of monitoring stations in locations of difficult access, without the need of manual data retrieval.

====Natural disaster prevention====
Wireless sensor networks can be effective in preventing adverse consequences of natural disasters, like floods. Wireless nodes have been deployed successfully in rivers, where changes in water levels must be monitored in real time.

===Industrial monitoring===

====Machine health monitoring====
Wireless sensor networks have been developed for machinery condition-based maintenance (CBM) as they offer significant cost savings and enable new functionality.

Wireless sensors can be placed in locations difficult or impossible to reach with a wired system, such as rotating machinery and untethered vehicles.

====Data logging====

Wireless sensor networks also are used for the collection of data for monitoring of environmental information. This can be as simple as monitoring the temperature in a fridge or the level of water in overflow tanks in nuclear power plants. The statistical information can then be used to show how systems have been working. The advantage of WSNs over conventional loggers is the &quot;live&quot; data feed that is possible.

====Water/waste water monitoring====
Monitoring the quality and level of water includes many activities such as checking the quality of underground or surface water and ensuring a country&#x27;s water infrastructure for the benefit of both human and animal. It may be used to protect the wastage of water.

====Structural health monitoring====

Wireless sensor networks can be used to monitor the condition of civil infrastructure and related geo-physical processes close to real time, and over long periods through data logging, using appropriately interfaced sensors.

====Wine production====
Wireless sensor networks are used to monitor wine production, both in the field and the cellar.

===Threat detection===
The Wide Area Tracking System (WATS) is a prototype network for detecting a ground-based nuclear device such as a nuclear &quot;briefcase bomb.&quot; WATS is being developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). WATS would be made up of wireless gamma and neutron sensors connected through a communications network. Data picked up by the sensors undergoes &quot;data fusion&quot;, which converts the information into easily interpreted forms; this data fusion is the most important aspect of the system.

The data fusion process occurs &quot;within&quot; the sensor network rather than at a centralized computer and is performed by a specially developed algorithm based on Bayesian statistics. WATS would not use a centralized computer for analysis because researchers found that factors such as latency and available bandwidth tended to create significant bottlenecks. Data processed in the field by the network itself (by transferring small amounts of data between neighboring sensors) is faster and makes the network more scalable.

An important factor in WATS development is &quot;ease of deployment&quot;, since more sensors both improves the detection rate and reduces false alarms. WATS sensors could be deployed in permanent positions or mounted in vehicles for mobile protection of specific locations. One barrier to the implementation of WATS is the size, weight, energy requirements and cost of currently available wireless sensors. The development of improved sensors is a major component of current research at the Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and International Security (NAI) Directorate at LLNL.

WATS was profiled to the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; Military Research and Development Subcommittee on October 1, 1997, during a hearing on nuclear terrorism and countermeasures. On August 4, 1998, in a subsequent meeting of that subcommittee, Chairman Curt Weldon stated that research funding for WATS had been cut by the Clinton administration to a subsistence level and that the program had been poorly re-organized.

==== Incident monitoring ====
There are studies that show that using sensors for incident monitoring improve in a great way the response of firefighters and police to an unexpected situation. For an early detection of incidents we can use acoustic sensors to detect a spike in the noise of the city because of a possible accident, or use termic sensors to detect a possible fire.

===Supply chains===
Using low-power electronics, WSN:s can be cost-efficiently applied also in supply chains in various industries.

==Characteristics==
The main characteristics of a WSN include

* Power consumption constraints for nodes using batteries or energy harvesting. Examples of suppliers are ReVibe Energy and Perpetuum
* Ability to cope with node failures (resilience)
* Some mobility of nodes (for highly mobile nodes see MWSNs)
* Heterogeneity of nodes
* Homogeneity of nodes
* Scalability to large scale of deployment
* Ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions
* Ease of use
*Cross-layer optimization

Cross-layer is becoming an important studying area for wireless communications. In addition, the traditional layered approach presents three main problems:
#Traditional layered approach cannot share different information among different layers, which leads to each layer not having complete information. The traditional layered approach cannot guarantee the optimization of the entire network.
#The traditional layered approach does not have the ability to adapt to the environmental change.
#Because of the interference between the different users, access conflicts, fading, and the change of environment in the wireless sensor networks, traditional layered approach for wired networks is not applicable to wireless networks.

So the cross-layer can be used to make the optimal modulation to improve the transmission performance, such as data rate, energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS), etc. Sensor nodes can be imagined as small computers which are extremely basic in terms of their interfaces and their components. They usually consist of a &quot;processing unit&quot; with limited computational power and limited memory, &quot;sensors&quot; or MEMS (including specific conditioning circuitry), a &quot;communication device&quot; (usually radio transceivers or alternatively optical), and a power source usually in the form of a battery. Other possible inclusions are energy harvesting modules, secondary ASICs, and possibly secondary communication interface (e.g. RS-232 or USB).

The base stations are one or more components of the WSN with much more computational, energy and communication resources. They act as a gateway between sensor nodes and the end user as they typically forward data from the WSN on to a server. Other special components in routing based networks are routers, designed to compute, calculate and distribute the routing tables.

==Platforms==
===Hardware===

One major challenge in a WSN is to produce &quot;low cost&quot; and &quot;tiny&quot; sensor nodes. There are an increasing number of small companies producing WSN hardware and the commercial situation can be compared to home computing in the 1970s. Many of the nodes are still in the research and development stage, particularly their software. Also inherent to sensor network adoption is the use of very low power methods for radio communication and data acquisition.

In many applications, a WSN communicates with a local area network or wide area network through a gateway. The Gateway acts as a bridge between the WSN and the other network. This enables data to be stored and processed by devices with more resources, for example, in a remotely located server. A wireless wide area network used primarily for low-power devices is known as a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN).

===Wireless===
There are several wireless standards and solutions for sensor node connectivity. Thread and Zigbee can connect sensors operating at 2.4 GHz with a data rate of 250 kbit/s. Many use a lower frequency to increase radio range (typically 1 km), for example Z-wave operates at 915 MHz and in the EU 868 MHz has been widely used but these have a lower data rate (typically 50 kbit/s). The IEEE 802.15.4 working group provides a standard for low power device connectivity and commonly sensors and smart meters use one of these standards for connectivity. With the emergence of Internet of Things, many other proposals have been made to provide sensor connectivity. LoRa is a form of LPWAN which provides long range low power wireless connectivity for devices, which has been used in smart meters and other long range sensor applications. Wi-SUN connects devices at home. NarrowBand IOT and LTE-M can connect up to millions of sensors and devices using cellular technology.

===Software===
Energy is the scarcest resource of WSN nodes, and it determines the lifetime of WSNs. WSNs may be deployed in large numbers in various environments, including remote and hostile regions, where ad hoc communications are a key component. For this reason, algorithms and protocols need to address the following issues:

* Increased lifespan
* Robustness and fault tolerance
* Self-configuration

Lifetime maximization: Energy/Power Consumption of the sensing device should be minimized and sensor nodes should be energy efficient since their limited energy resource determines their lifetime. To conserve power, wireless sensor nodes normally power off both the radio transmitter and the radio receiver when not in use.

====Routing protocols====
Wireless sensor networks are composed of low-energy, small-size, and low-range unattended sensor nodes. Recently, it has been observed that by periodically turning on and off the sensing and communication capabilities of sensor nodes, we can significantly reduce the active time and thus prolong network lifetime. However, this duty cycling may result in high network latency, routing overhead, and neighbor discovery delays due to asynchronous sleep and wake-up scheduling. These limitations call for a countermeasure for duty-cycled wireless sensor networks which should minimize routing information, routing traffic load, and energy consumption. Researchers from Sungkyunkwan University have proposed a lightweight non-increasing delivery-latency interval routing referred as LNDIR. This scheme can discover minimum latency routes at each non-increasing delivery-latency interval instead of each time slot. Simulation experiments demonstrated the validity of this novel approach in minimizing routing information stored at each sensor. Furthermore, this novel routing can also guarantee the minimum delivery latency from each source to the sink. Performance improvements of up to 12-fold and 11-fold are observed in terms of routing traffic load reduction and energy efficiency, respectively, as compared to existing schemes.

====Operating systems====
Operating systems for wireless sensor network nodes are typically less complex than general-purpose operating systems. They more strongly resemble embedded systems, for two reasons. First, wireless sensor networks are typically deployed with a particular application in mind, rather than as a general platform. Second, a need for low costs and low power leads most wireless sensor nodes to have low-power microcontrollers ensuring that mechanisms such as virtual memory are either unnecessary or too expensive to implement.

It is therefore possible to use embedded operating systems such as eCos or uC/OS for sensor networks. However, such operating systems are often designed with real-time properties.

TinyOS, developed by David Culler, is perhaps the first operating system specifically designed for wireless sensor networks. TinyOS is based on an event-driven programming model instead of multithreading. TinyOS programs are composed of &quot;event handlers&quot; and &quot;tasks&quot; with run-to-completion semantics. When an external event occurs, such as an incoming data packet or a sensor reading, TinyOS signals the appropriate event handler to handle the event. Event handlers can post tasks that are scheduled by the TinyOS kernel some time later.

LiteOS is a newly developed OS for wireless sensor networks, which provides UNIX-like abstraction and support for the C programming language.

Contiki, developed by Adam Dunkels, is an OS which uses a simpler programming style in C while providing advances such as 6LoWPAN and Protothreads.

RIOT (operating system) is a more recent real-time OS including similar functionality to Contiki.

PreonVM is an OS for wireless sensor networks, which provides 6LoWPAN based on Contiki and support for the Java programming language.

===Online collaborative sensor data management platforms===
Online collaborative sensor data management platforms are on-line database services that allow sensor owners to register and connect their devices to feed data into an online database for storage and also allow developers to connect to the database and build their own applications based on that data. Examples include Xively and the Wikisensing platform . Such platforms simplify online collaboration between users over diverse data sets ranging from energy and environment data to that collected from transport services. Other services include allowing developers to embed real-time graphs &amp; widgets in websites; analyse and process historical data pulled from the data feeds; send real-time alerts from any datastream to control scripts, devices and environments.

The architecture of the Wikisensing system describes the key components of such systems to include APIs and interfaces for online collaborators, a middleware containing the business logic needed for the sensor data management and processing and a storage model suitable for the efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data.

==Simulation==
At present, agent-based modeling and simulation is the only paradigm which allows the simulation of complex behavior in the environments of wireless sensors (such as flocking). Agent-based simulation of wireless sensor and ad hoc networks is a relatively new paradigm. Agent-based modelling was originally based on social simulation.

Network simulators like Opnet, Tetcos NetSim and NS can be used to simulate a wireless sensor network.

==Other concepts==

===Localization===
Network localization refers to the problem of estimating the location of wireless sensor nodes during deployments and in dynamic settings. For ultra-low power sensors, size, cost and environment precludes the use of Global Positioning System receivers on sensors. In 2000, Nirupama Bulusu, John Heidemann and Deborah Estrin first motivated and proposed a radio connectivity based system for localization of wireless sensor networks. Subsequently, such localization systems have been referred to as range free localization systems, and many localization systems for wireless sensor networks have been subsequently proposed including AHLoS, APS, and Stardust.

===Sensor data calibration and fault tolerance===

Sensors and devices used in wireless sensor networks are state-of-the-art technology with the lowest possible price. The sensor measurements we get from these devices are therefore often noisy, incomplete and inaccurate. Researchers studying wireless sensor networks hypothesize that much more information can be extracted from hundreds of unreliable measurements spread across a field of interest than from a smaller number of high-quality, high-reliability instruments with the same total cost.

===Macroprogramming===
Macro-programming is a term coined by Matt Welsh. It refers to programming the entire sensor network as an ensemble, rather than individual sensor nodes. Another way to macro-program a network is to view the sensor network as a database, which was popularized by the TinyDB system developed by Sam Madden.

=== Reprogramming ===
Reprogramming is the process of updating the code on the sensor nodes. The most feasible form of reprogramming is remote reprogramming whereby the code is disseminated wirelessly while the nodes are deployed. Different reprogramming protocols exist that provide different levels of speed of operation, reliability, energy expenditure, requirement of code resident on the nodes, suitability to different wireless environments, resistance to DoS, etc. Popular reprogramming protocols are Deluge (2004), Trickle (2004), MNP (2005), Synapse (2008), and Zephyr (2009).

=== Security ===
Infrastructure-less architecture (i.e. no gateways are included, etc.) and inherent requirements (i.e. unattended working environment, etc.) of WSNs might pose several weak points that attract adversaries. Therefore, security is a big concern when WSNs are deployed for special applications such as military and healthcare. Owing to their unique characteristics, traditional security methods of computer networks would be useless (or less effective) for WSNs. Hence, lack of security mechanisms would cause intrusions towards those networks. These intrusions need to be detected and mitigation methods should be applied.

There have been important innovations in securing wireless sensor networks. Most wireless embedded networks use omni-directional  antennas and therefore neighbors can overhear communication in and out of nodes. This was used this to develop a primitive called &quot;local monitoring&quot; which was used for detection  of sophisticated attacks, like blackhole or wormhole, which degrade the  throughput of large networks to close-to-zero. This primitive has since been  used by many researchers and commercial wireless packet sniffers. This was subsequently refined for more sophisticated attacks such as with  collusion, mobility,  and multi-antenna, multi-channel devices.

===Distributed sensor network===
If a centralized architecture is used in a sensor network and the central node fails, then the entire network will collapse, however the reliability of the sensor network can be increased by using a distributed control architecture. Distributed control is used in WSNs for the following reasons:

# Sensor nodes are prone to failure,
# For better collection of data,
# To provide nodes with backup in case of failure of the central node.

There is also no centralised body to allocate the resources and they have to be self organized.

As for the distributed filtering over distributed sensor network. the general setup is to observe the underlying process through a group of sensors organized according to a given network topology, which renders the individual observer estimates the system state based not only on its own measurement but also on its neighbors&#x27;.

===Data integration and sensor web===

The data gathered from wireless sensor networks is usually saved in the form of numerical data in a central base station. Additionally, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is specifying standards for interoperability interfaces and metadata encodings that enable real time integration of heterogeneous sensor webs into the Internet, allowing any individual to monitor or control wireless sensor networks through a web browser.

===In-network processing===
To reduce communication costs some algorithms remove or reduce nodes&#x27; redundant sensor information and avoid forwarding data that is of no use. This technique has been used, for instance, for distributed anomaly detection or distributed optimization. As nodes can inspect the data they forward, they can measure averages or directionality for example of readings from other nodes. For example, in sensing and monitoring applications, it is generally the case that neighboring sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. Aggregation reduces the amount of network traffic which helps to reduce energy consumption on sensor nodes. Recently, it has been found that network gateways also play an important role in improving energy efficiency of sensor nodes by scheduling more resources for the nodes with more critical energy efficiency need and advanced energy efficient scheduling algorithms need to be implemented at network gateways for the improvement of the overall network energy efficiency.

===Secure data aggregation===
This is a form of in-network processing where sensor nodes are assumed to be unsecured with limited available energy, while the base station is assumed to be secure with unlimited available energy. Aggregation complicates the already existing security challenges for wireless sensor networks and requires new security techniques tailored specifically for these scenarios. Providing security to aggregate data in wireless sensor networks is known as &quot;secure data aggregation in WSN&quot;. were the first few works discussing techniques for secure  data aggregation in wireless sensor networks.

Two main security challenges in secure data aggregation are confidentiality and integrity of data. While encryption is traditionally used to provide end to end confidentiality in wireless sensor network, the aggregators in a secure data aggregation scenario need to decrypt the encrypted data to perform aggregation. This exposes the plaintext at the aggregators, making the data vulnerable to attacks from an adversary. Similarly an aggregator can inject false data into the aggregate and make the base station accept false data. Thus, while data aggregation improves energy efficiency of a network, it complicates the existing security challenges.

<text>Justin Pascal Keating (7 January 1930 – 31 December 2009) was an Irish Labour Party politician, broadcaster, journalist, lecturer and veterinary surgeon. In later life he was president of the Humanist Association of Ireland.

Keating was twice elected to Dáil Éireann and served in Liam Cosgrave&#x27;s cabinet as Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1973 to 1977. He also gained election to Seanad Éireann and was a Member of the European Parliament. He was considered part of a &quot;new wave&quot; of politicians at the time of his entry to the Dáil.

==Early life==
He was born in Dublin in 1930, a son of the noted painter Seán Keating and campaigner May Keating. Keating was educated at Sandford Park School, and then at University College Dublin (UCD) and the University of London. He became a lecturer in anatomy at the UCD veterinary college from 1955 until 1960 and was senior lecturer at Trinity College Dublin from 1960 until 1965. He was RTÉ&#x27;s head of agricultural programmes for two years before returning to Trinity College in 1967. While at RTÉ, he scripted and presented &quot;Telefís Feirme&quot;, a series for the agricultural community, for which he won a Jacob&#x27;s Award in 1966.

==Political career==
In the 1950s and 1960s Keating was a member of the Communist Irish Workers&#x27; Party.
Keating was first elected to the Dáil as a Labour Party Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin County North constituency at the 1969 general election. From 1973 to 1977 he served in the National Coalition government under Liam Cosgrave as Minister for Industry and Commerce. In 1973 he was appointed a Member of the European Parliament from the Oireachtas, serving on the short-lived first delegation.

During 1975 Keating introduced the first substantial legislation for the development of Ireland&#x27;s oil and gas. The legislation was modelled on international best practice and intended to ensure the Irish people would gain substantial benefit from their own oil and gas. Under Keating&#x27;s legislation the state could by right acquire a 50% stake in any viable oil and gas reserves discovered. Production royalties of between 8% and 16% with corporation tax of 50% would accrue to the state. The legislation specified that energy companies would begin drilling within three years of the date of the issue of an exploration license.

He lost his Dáil seat at the 1977 general election, but was subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann on the Agricultural Panel, serving there until 1981. He briefly served again in the European Parliament from February to June 1984 when he replaced Séamus Pattison.

==Later life and death==
In the aftermath of President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s &quot;World Without Zionism&quot; speech in 2005, Keating published an op-ed in &quot;The Dubliner&quot; Magazine, expressing his views on Israel. The article started by claiming that &quot;the Zionists have absolutely no right in what they call Israel&quot;. Keating then proceeds to explain why he thinks Israel has no right to exist, claiming that the Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Khazars.

Keating died on 31 December 2009, at age 79, one week before his 80th birthday. Tributes came from the leaders of the Labour Party and Fine Gael at the time of his death, Eamon Gilmore and Enda Kenny, as well as former Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach John Bruton.

<doc id="1076674" wikidata="Q738423" url="?curid=1076674" title="Gamba Osaka">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Suita, Osaka Prefecture. The club plays in the J1 League, which is the top tier of football in the country. The club&#x27;s home stadium is Panasonic Stadium Suita. They form a local rivalry with Osaka city-based Cerezo Osaka.

Gamba is among the most accomplished Japanese clubs, having won 2 J1 League title, 1 J2 League title, 2 J.League Cup and 2 Japanese Super Cup. Continentally, as well as the 2008 AFC Champions League. Internationally, the club has made a single appearance in the FIFA Club World Cup with their most recent appearance being in the 2008 edition finishing in third place.

== Name origin ==

The club&#x27;s name &quot;Gamba&quot; comes from the Japanese , meaning &quot;to do your best&quot; or &quot;to stand firm&quot;.

== History ==

It was founded in 1980 as Matsushita Electric SC by the mononymous company, which is now known as Panasonic, in Nara Prefecture and became a member of the Japan Soccer League. It was mostly made of remaining players and staff of the defunct Yanmar Club, the former B-team of Yanmar Diesel SC, later to be known as Cerezo Osaka. Gamba Osaka was an original member (&quot;Original Ten&quot;) of the first J.League season. Due to participation in the J League, the club name was changed to Panasonic Gamba Osaka in 1992.

In 1996, the club dropped the name Panasonic from its front while its corporate name was changed from &quot;Matsushita Soccer Club Co., Ltd.&quot; to &quot;Gamba Osaka Co., Ltd.&quot;

=== Record breaking ===
In 2005, the club claimed its first J.League championship on a dramatic final day during which any of five clubs could have claimed the championship. Gamba needed to win, and have cross town rivals Cerezo Osaka draw or lose. Gamba defeated a valiant Kawasaki Frontale 4–2, while victory was snatched from Cerezo by a last-minute FC Tokyo equalizer. In an AFC Champions League match in 2006, Gamba Osaka defeated Vietnamese side Da Nang FC in a record-equaling victory of 15–0. In the 2008 Pan-Pacific Championship final, Gamba Osaka beat MLS club Houston Dynamo 6–1 to win the tournament, in large part because of Bare who scored 4 goals in the final (5 in all at the tournament). After his brilliant display and having just scored 10 goals in 18 games for Gamba in the domestic league, he was sold to UAE club Al-Ahli for 1 billion yen.

=== Asian Champions ===
In October 2008, Gamba for the first time in their history, reached the final of the AFC Champions League after defeating fellow Japanese league rivals Urawa Red Diamonds 4–2 on aggregate after a 1–1 draw at home in the first leg, Gamba registered one of the most historic comebacks in Champions League history when they came back from being behind 1–0 before half time to win 1–3 with all goals scored in the second half at Saitama. Gamba Osaka went on to win the 2008 AFC Champions League title after winning 5–0 on aggregate against the giant-killing Australian club Adelaide United in the Final. They became the fifth Japanese club to win the maximum Asian title, after Urawa, Júbilo Iwata, then-company-affiliated Yomiuri (now Tokyo Verdy), and Furukawa Electric (now JEF United Ichihara Chiba).

In December 2008, Gamba made it to the semi-finals of the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup after beating Australian club Adelaide United 1–0. They were beaten in the semi-finals by 2007–08 Premier League and 2007–08 UEFA Champions League winners Manchester United. On 21 December 2008, they played for third place against Mexican side Pachuca with Gamba winning the match 1–0.

In December 2012, Gamba were relegated from Division 1 after losing 2–1 to Júbilo Iwata. Gamba finished 17th in the league despite scoring more goals than any other club, including Champion Sanfrecce Hiroshima. Ultimately, although Gamba had a positive goal difference at the end of the season, Gamba could not overcome their poor defense, which allowed the second most goals in Division 1 after Consadole Sapporo. This also made Gamba Osaka the fastest club to suffer relegation from the top division after winning the AFC Champion&#x27;s League and playing in the FIFA Club World Cup, the relegation being only four years later. However, the club bounced back in the 2013 season, becoming the J2 Champion and directly promoting to Division 1 again after only one season.

In 2014, Gamba won the Division 1 title, a year after winning the second division, becoming the second club in the professional era to achieve this feat (after Kashiwa Reysol in 2011). That same year, Gamba also became the second club to win the domestic treble (after Kashima Antlers in 2000), by winning the J.League Cup and the Emperor&#x27;s Cup as well.

In 2015 saw Gamba return to the AFC Champions League for the first time since 2012, where they advanced all the way to the semi-finals before being eliminated by eventual winner and 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Fourth Place, Guangzhou Evergrande 1–2 on aggregate. Domestically, Gamba Osaka advanced to the final of both the 2015 J.League Cup and the J1 League Championship, losing to Kashima Antlers 0–3 and Club World Cup Third Place Sanfrecce Hiroshima 3–4 respectively. Gamba Osaka successfully defended their status as the 2015 Emperor&#x27;s Cup winners, defeating Urawa Red Diamonds 2–1.\

In 2020, Gamba finished as the 2020 J1 League runners up in which saw the club returned to the 2021 AFC Champions League once again since 2017. Gamba was than drawn in Group H alongside South Korean giants Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, Thailand club Chiangrai United and Singaporean side Tampines Rovers. On 7 July 2021, Gamba managed to record their highest ever win in the AFC Champions League after thrashing Tampines Rovers 8–1 at the Bunyodkor Stadium where Shuhei Kawasaki scored a hat-trick in the match. However, the club failed to qualified to the Round of 16 even when they finished the group as runners up due to accumulating 9 points.

In the 2024 season, Gamba finished in fourth in the league which sees the club qualified to the 2025–26 AFC Champions League Two group stage.

== Affiliated clubs ==

* Chonburi (2023–&quot;present&quot;) 

On 6 February 2023, Gamba Osaka sign partnership with Thai League 1 club, Chonburi. The alliance intends to strengthen the top team through player transfers, training-type loans and other mutual exchange of coaching staff and players.

Under this agreement the teams will share and cooperate with player scouting information to mutually improve both teams.

* AFC Ajax (2024–&quot;present&quot;) 

On 4 March 2024, Gamba Osaka and 36-time Eredivisie champions announce a strategic partnership to advance talent identification and development initiatives in Japan. This exclusive collaboration is scheduled to extend over an initial three-year period. For Ajax, this partnership represents a significant opportunity to strengthen its global football network and identify and nurture young talents in the Japanese football landscape. Gamba Osaka, in turn, gains access to Ajax&#x27;s renowned training methodologies for its youth development program while establishing connections within the global football community.

<text>David Z. Albert (born 1954) is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the MA Program in The Philosophical Foundations of Physics at Columbia University in New York.

==Education and career==

He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Columbia College (1976) and his PhD in theoretical physics from The Rockefeller University (1981) under Professor Nicola Khuri. Afterwards he worked with Yakir Aharonov of Tel Aviv University. He has spent most of his career in the philosophy department at Columbia University, although he has also been a frequent visiting professor of philosophy at Rutgers University. In 2015, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

==Philosophical work==

Albert has published four books—&quot;Quantum Mechanics and Experience&quot; (1992), &quot;Time and Chance&quot; (2000), &quot;After Physics&quot; (2015), and &quot;A Guess at the Riddle&quot; (2023)—as well as numerous articles on quantum mechanics. His books have been both praised and criticized for their informal, conversational style.

==Public philosophy==

===Appearance in &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot;===
Albert appeared in the controversial movie &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; (2004). According to an article published in &quot;Popular Science&quot;, he was &quot;outraged at the final product.&quot; The article states that Albert granted the filmmakers a near-four hour interview about quantum mechanics being unrelated to consciousness or spirituality. His interview was then edited and incorporated into the film in a way that misrepresented his views. In the article, Albert also expresses his feelings of gullibility after having been &quot;taken&quot; by the filmmakers. Although Albert is listed as a scientist taking part in the sequel to &quot;What the Bleep&quot;, called &quot;Down the Rabbit Hole&quot;, this sequel is a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;, composed of extra footage from the filming of the first movie.

===Feud with Lawrence Krauss===
In March 2012, Albert published an extremely negative review of Lawrence Krauss&#x27; book &quot;A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; book review. Krauss claimed that his book counters religion and philosophy, and the book was cited by Richard Dawkins as comparable to Darwin’s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;, on the grounds that it upends the “last trump card of the theologian.” In his review, Albert lamented the way in which books like Krauss&#x27; forward critiques of religion that are &quot;pale, small, silly, nerdy”, and expresses how &quot;the whole business of approaching the struggle with religion as if it were a card game, or a horse race, or some kind of battle of wits, just feels all wrong&quot;. Disagreeing with the central thesis of Krauss&#x27; book, Albert wrote:
Krauss reacted vehemently and responded in an interview published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, calling Albert “moronic” and dismissing the philosophy of science as worthless. In March 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Albert, who had previously been invited to speak at the Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate at the American Museum of Natural History, at which Krauss was also an invited speaker, was later disinvited. Albert claimed &quot;It sparked a suspicion that Krauss must have demanded that I not be invited. But of course I’ve got no proof.&quot;

<text>Patrick Joseph Ruttledge (1 January 1892 – 8 May 1952) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Local Government and Public Health from 1939 to 1941, Minister for Justice from 1933 to 1939, Minister for Lands and Fisheries from 1932 to 1933 and Vice President of Sinn Féin from 1923 to 1926. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1921 to 1951.

Born in Ballina, County Mayo, in 1892. He was educated at St Muredach&#x27;s College and later at St. Enda&#x27;s School, Rathfarnham, Dublin, run by Patrick Pearse. After studying at Trinity College Dublin, he qualified as a solicitor in 1918 and built up a practice in his home town.

During the Irish War of Independence he was active in the Irish Republican Army. He was a close friend of Seán Mac Diarmada, with whom he lived for some time. He also took part in local politics, becoming chair of Ballina Urban Council from 1919 to 1932 and chair of Mayo County Council from 1922 to 1926.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1921 as a Sinn Féin TD for Mayo North and West. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 and joined the Republican forces and was seriously injured during the Civil War. He was re-elected to the Dáil again in 1923 for Mayo North and in a further ten elections until 1951. In 1926, Ruttledge was a founder-member of Fianna Fáil. In the Dail (in 1928) Ruttledge put forth a proposal for a committee to review the many long prison sentences under which many Republicans were still being held. He stated that the long sentences &quot;reflected a partisan spirit in keeping with the vendetta by prominent political leaders at the time.&quot;

==Cabinet positions==
He joined the cabinet of Éamon de Valera in 1932, serving as Minister for Lands and Fisheries, Minister for Justice and Minister for Local Government and Public Health, resigning in 1941 for the officially stated reason of &quot;ill health&quot;. However, it is speculated by some historians that his actual motivation for the resignation was that he morally objected to the execution of IRA members by the Fianna Fáil government. Ruttledge continued to work as TD for over a decade after his resignation despite his &quot;ill health&quot;. 
=== Minister of Justice ===
During Ruttledge&#x27;s tenure as Minister for Justice, three IRA men were executed for IRA activities but eight others had their death sentences commuted. Ruttledge worked to suppress a movement he considered to be fascist (the Blueshirts). In February 1933 he had their leader Eoin O&#x27;Duffy removed from his position as the Commissioner of the Irish national police force - the Garda Síochána. In 1934 Ruttledge introduced anti-fascist legislation that would prevent the Blueshirts from wearing their uniforms in public (also known as the Blueshirts Bill). 
In 1937 Ruttledge banned the annual IRA Easter Rising commemoration in Castlebar, County Mayo. Violence ensued with police baton charging marchers with numerous injuries and 13 arrests for Civil Disobedience (including future hunger striker Jack McNeela). 

Ruttledge died in 1952 while still a member of the Dáil. He was described by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; as &#x27;a gentle, kind and upright man&#x27;. He married Helena Roddy in 1928, and they had one son who died young and three daughters. A horse breeder, he was a member of the Turf Club and won the Irish Derby with Mondragon in 1939.

<text>René Laloux (; 13 July 1929 – 15 March 2004) was a French animator, screenwriter and film director.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris in 1929 and went to art school to study painting. After some time working in advertising, he got a job in a psychiatric institution where he began experimenting in animation with the interns. It is at the psychiatric institution that he made the 1960 film &quot;Monkey&#x27;s Teeth&quot; (&quot;Les Dents du Singe&quot;), in collaboration with Paul Grimault&#x27;s studio, and using a script written by the Cour Cheverny&#x27;s interns.

Another important collaborator of his was Roland Topor with whom Laloux made &quot;Dead Time&quot; (&quot;Les Temps Morts&quot;, 1964), &quot;The Snails&quot; (&quot;Les Escargots&quot;, 1965) and his most famous work, the feature length &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot; (&quot;La Planète Sauvage&quot;, 1973).

Laloux also worked with Jean Giraud (Mœbius) to create the lesser known film &quot;Les Maîtres du temps&quot; (&quot;Time Masters&quot;), released in 1982. Laloux&#x27;s 1987 film, &quot;Gandahar&quot;, was released in the US as &quot;Light Years&quot;, and made in cooperation with the artist Caza. The US version was redubbed by Harvey Weinstein, from a screenplay adapted by Isaac Asimov. The US version was not as successful as the French, grossing less than $400,000 on its release.

Laloux died of a heart attack on 14 March 2004 in Angoulême, Charente, Poitou-Charentes, France.

<doc id="1076695" wikidata="Q366978" url="?curid=1076695" title="György Dózsa">
<text>György Dózsa (or &quot;György Székely&quot;, Romanian: &quot;Gheorghe Doja&quot;; – 20 July 1514) was a Székely man-at-arms from Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary who led a peasants&#x27; revolt against the kingdom&#x27;s landed nobility during the reign of King Vladislaus II of Hungary. The rebellion was suppressed, and Dózsa captured, tortured, and executed by being seated on a throne (itself smouldering according to legend), crowned with red-hot iron, devoured alive by his followers under duress, and then quartered.

==Ancestry and early life==
György Dózsa was of Székely origins and known to his contemporaries as György Székely. Based on primary sources, he was probably in his forties or fifties at the time of his execution and thus must have been born around 1470. Nothing more specific is known of his ancestry, family, or early life. His birthplace has been suggested as Dálnok (today Dalnic, Romania). It was asserted by Márki in his 1913 biography of Dózsa that he was the man identified in a 1507 court document as &quot;Georgius Dosa Siculus de Makfalva&quot; (today Ghindari, Romania) and was therefore from the Dózsa family belonging to the Szovát branch of the Örlőcz clan. This has since been questioned, as variants of the family name Dózsa were &#x27;quite common&#x27; at the time in Transylvania. Márki suggested a family tree starting with András Dózsa in the beginning of the 15th century who lived in Marosszék. His sons, Tamás and Ádám would have then moved to Dálnok and started families. Tamás, a &quot;vajda&quot; (infantry captain) became György Dózsa&#x27;s father. Pataki doubts this, as Székelys of the &quot;lófő&quot; rank (as Márki stipulated the Dózsas were) depended on their land for their place in the economic and social hierarchy, which limited their mobility by making them reluctant to sell or exchange their lands (although they did do so at times). Therefore, he considers it unproven that the György Dózsa from Dálnok was the same person recorded as being from Makfalva in the 1507 court document.

Dózsa had a younger brother, Gergely Dózsa (Gregory Dózsa), who would be executed alongside him. Contemporary sources attest that Dózsa&#x27;s father had had four sons; besides György and Gergely, they have been named as János (John), Lukács (Lukas), and Menyhért (Melchior). As Lukács is usually credited with the acts attributed to Gergely in other sources, the two names probably denote the same person. Menyhért supposedly became the ban of Croatia, but there is little to support this connection. Márki suggests that János might have been the same as a János Székely inciting a rebellion among the Transylvanian Saxons in 1513–1514, but Pataki disputes this. Márki claims that the family still had members in 1913, descending from Ádám Dózsa, György Dózsa&#x27;s uncle. However, Pataki found no record of people named Dózsa living in or near Dálnok in the 1602 or the more extensive 1614 census, although many &quot;lófő&quot; and noble families with the name Székely lived there. Márki further argues that Dózsa had a sister, Katalin, who married Miklós Zeyk, a future supporter of King John Zápolya.

Dózsa probably did not receive much education, and seems to have been illiterate. He grew up in a time of widespread social upheaval and small rebellions. During the reign of King Matthias Corvinus, which covered what was probably Dózsa&#x27;s childhood, peasants were taxed oppressively; after Matthias&#x27; death in 1490, the War of the Hungarian Succession broke out between John Corvinus (the late King&#x27;s illegitimate son), Emperor Maximilian I, and two brothers from the Jagiellonian dynasty, John Albert and Vladislaus. The conflict impacted Transylvania, with the Székelys supporting Vladislaus. After his victory, they nevertheless suffered the tyranny of Voivode István Báthory, who extorted rents and taxes by torture and intimidation. Many Székelys fled the country, and Báthory&#x27;s actions eventually prompted a successful revolt to replace him in December 1492. Even afterwards, the period that was probably Dózsa&#x27;s youth and early adulthood was punctuated with revolts and rebellions, the most violent in 1506.

If the 1507 court document about &quot;Georgius Dosa Siculus de Makfalva&quot; indeed refers to Dózsa, he committed a violent robbery at a market in Medgyes (today Mediaș, Romania) that year, killing multiple merchants. The document requests that he be punished and removed in order to preserve the community&#x27;s peace. However, it remains unclear whether this case concerns Dózsa or another man of a similar name. Family tradition recounted by Márki holds that Dózsa was a &#x27;tall, strong&#x27; man with curly brown hair and of exceptional physical strength, but there are no contemporaneous depictions or descriptions of him.

== Mercenary career and heroism ==
It has been claimed by Márki and accepted by Pataki that Dózsa participated in the 1513 campaign of John Zápolya against Ottoman forces. He then probably joined the defence of Nándorfehérvár (today Belgrade, Serbia). Sources mention him as a cavalry captain of great courage during this siege. They tell the story of him beating the Ottoman champion, &quot;bey&quot; of the spahis of Szendrő (today Smederevo, Serbia), named as Ali of Epeiros in a duel on 28 February 1514. Ali was a great swordsman, who had already caused the death of many Hungarian valiants during his duels.

Dózsa&#x27;s desire for glory was growing, and his fellow soldiers tried in vain to dissuade him from challenging the feared Ottoman champion to a duel. According to legend, Dózsa was incensed by Ali insulting the Hungarians and also wanted to take his &#x27;magnificent horse&#x27; for himself. In the popular account, the two men first fought with spears then with swords on a field outside the castle of Nándorfehérvár, and Dózsa cut off Ali&#x27;s armour-covered right hand &#x27;in one [piece]&#x27;. He then killed him. Although there is no decisive proof of how the duel exactly happened, it seems to have been considered important: King Vladislaus rewarded Dózsa with a noble title, a village, and a coat of arms. Some accounts claim that Dózsa demanded a prize himself, arriving at Buda with a letter of recommendation from his commander, others that he was summoned by the royal court. He perhaps took Ali&#x27;s right arm there as proof of his victory.
With this victory, Dózsa won a nationwide reputation and fame.

One source claims that Dózsa committed a crime before arriving at court. He is suggested to have been rewarded with a large sum of money by the King, which the treasurer, István Telegdy, refused to give to him. At this, Dózsa murdered a royal tax collector, stole three thousand gold coins from him, and threatened to join the Ottomans. The court feared that Dózsa could open Nándorfehérvár to the enemy, and bought his loyalty with two hundred gold coins and two horses in golden and silver tacks. However, Márki does not believe that this happened, as the court would have had no reason to reward a soldier threatening treason instead of executing him. 

When Dózsa arrived in Buda, some primary sources describe him being reprimanded by Miklós Csáky, Bishop of Csanád for his crimes. Dózsa then complained to Cardinal Tamás Bakócz, Archbishop of Esztergom, who gave him command of the crusaders as a consolation. This is unlikely to have happened in this way. Dózsa was, however, knighted by the King, his wages doubled. He was given a village of forty households located between Nándorfehérvár and Temesvár, as well as two hundred gold coins. The coat of arms of his family was also renewed (or given to him to ennoble him, as it is unclear whether his ancestors had been nobles) and a bleeding, cut-off arm holding a sword was included on it. Based on the crimson robes embroidered with gold and golden chain given to him, Márki claims that Dózsa was rewarded above the level of simple knighthood and could have hoped for a career at the royal court.

== Peasant crusade ==

=== Background ===
On 9 March 1513, Pope Leo X was elected, a man enthusiastic about driving the Ottomans out of Europe. On 17 June 1513, he published a bull authorising a crusade, appointing Archbishop Bakócz to organise it. The bull called not on European princes but on the people to fight the holy war and pre-emptively branded anyone who would impede the crusade as traitors. When he returned to Hungary, the Archbishop was warned by the King that the country was strained financially and unable to furnish even the most important fortresses on the border. Among the leading barons of the country, there was a debate about the wisdom of launching a crusade: Bakócz argued that Hungary needed to exploit the internal strife of the Ottoman Empire for its own protection and go against them with as large an army as possible, considering that foreign aid was unlikely. The treasurer, István Telegdy thought that it would be wiser not to recruit commoners: a large number of missing peasants would be devastating for the country&#x27;s agriculture during the summer, and untrained agricultural workers had little military value. He proposed only asking commoners for donations and relying on noble&#x27;s &quot;banderiums&quot; for the crusade. The party favouring the peasants&#x27; crusade won and the bull was published on 9 April. The King arranged for tithes to be redirected to fund the operations.

=== Social tensions and the role of the Franciscans ===
Bakócz entrusted recruitment to the Franciscan order, probably on 25 April 1514. Due to the work of the friars, there were around 15,000 volunteers in the camp at Pest within two weeks. However, there was also news of friars agitating against the feudal order around the country. Radical notions of social equality had been noted among Hungarian Franciscans for decades. Superiors were concerned with a tendency of monks to question authority on the basis that they only owed obedience to God, and with young friars giving lengthy speeches based on scriptures instead of repeating conventional interpretations. From the beginning of the 1510s, these phenomena were exacerbated with apocalyptic visions some Franciscans claimed to have. In 1512 and 1513, there seems to have been a movement of young friars who disobeyed orders and openly criticised bishops and abbots. 

Early religious reform ideologies, especially the teachings of Jan Hus, had been present in Hungary for decades, and many of the volunteers had social and political goals in mind when joining the crusade. Franciscans organised &#x27;gatherings&#x27; in many parts of the country which worried lords. The friars and their supporters urged peasants to deny the rents and taxes due to the king and to landlords and declared general disobedience to superiors. There were calls for violence against tax collectors and officials. Tensions reached the point of open revolt before 15 May 1514, but on the 20th at the latest, and Bakócz was warned some days before the 15th about attacks against manor houses and the possibility of a widespread uprising.

=== Recruitment ===
At first, volunteers gathered slowly: only three hundred people were in the camp by 24 April. A contemporary source claims that Dózsa went to Bakócz &#x27;extraordinarily upset&#x27;, asking to be appointed leader of the crusade in order to protect the peasants from exploitation. The chronicler gives the explanation that Dózsa in fact wanted to use the peasant army to take vengeance on the lords for withholding two hundred gold coins of rewards from him. For the time at least, he was not named leader, and the story of him asking for command is an improbable one.

Choosing a commander was a problem for the crusade: the lords &#x27;scorned&#x27; at the commons, and none of them were popular enough. Bakócz needed to find someone who was of noble origins (to uphold the notion that armies should be led by nobles), but not powerful enough to arouse the jealousy of the leading lords of the country; he would also need to be liked well enough by peasants and possess some military experience. According to Márki, these were the reasons for the Archbishop entering talks with Dózsa, who had recent experience fighting against the Ottomans and appointed him commander on 24 April. However, there is no mention of Dózsa in contemporary sources before 3 June 1514, and no proof that he was ever appointed to command the crusaders camping around Pest. More recent scholarship suggests that at this early time, a man named Menyhért was in charge, Dózsa only taking control when the displeased peasants became violent. Contemporary diplomatic reports named a Melchior Bannser/Banckwr/Vanser/Vanbosor as commander of the camp, who was probably a German or Czech mercenary captain. During the upheaval of the peasant revolt, this Melchior or Menyhért and Dózsa were often mixed up in reports and it is unclear what actions pertained to which one of them in the early weeks of the crusade and developing revolt.

== Leader of the peasant revolt ==
Within a few weeks, Dózsa had gathered an army of some 40,000 so-called &quot;hajdú&quot;, consisting for the most part of peasants, wandering students, friars, and parish priests - some of the lowest-ranking groups of medieval society. They assembled in their counties, and by the time he had provided them with some military training, they began to air their grievances about their status. No measures had been taken to supply these voluntary crusaders with food or clothing. As harvest-time approached, the landlords commanded them to return to reap the fields, and, on their refusal to do so, proceeded to maltreat their wives and families and set their armed retainers upon the local peasantry.

The volunteers became increasingly angry at the failure of the nobility to provide military leadership (the original and primary function of the nobility and the justification for their higher status in the society.) The rebellious, anti-landlord sentiment of these &quot;Crusaders&quot; became apparent during their march across the Great Hungarian Plain, and Bakócz cancelled the campaign. 
At that time, Bakócz stopped recruiting on the news of the clashes between peasants and nobles in Mezőtúr, and later on he stopped the whole campaign. However, György Dózsa, his brother Gergely Dózsa and several Franciscan friars, headed by the priest Lőrinc, disobeyed the order to stop the recruitment. From then on, the crusaders labelled the nobles and the king himself as pro-Ottoman traitors. After that, the peasant armies regarded the defeat of the nobility and the king as a prerequisite for victory in their crusade against the Ottoman Empire.

The movement was thus diverted from its original object, and the peasants and their leaders began a war of vengeance against the landlords.

===Dózsa&#x27;s most notable elected co-leaders===
The peasant armies did not trust the leadership of the nobility, thus they elected their own leaders.

* Gregory Dózsa (Gergely Dózsa), younger brother of György Dózsa,
* Laurence Mészáros (Lőrinc Mészáros), a Franciscan friar and parish priest of Cegléd, who in his proclamation, the Pope, II. In the name of King Vladislaus and the legate, he promised the forgiveness of all sins and otherworldly punishment to those who go to the crusade, help it and take care of its sick, but he threatened church curses to those who do not do this. 
* &quot;Priest Barabbas&quot; (Barabás),
* Ambrose Ványa (Ambrus Ványa) from turkeve, a Franciscan theologist who graduated from the university, he edited Dozsa&#x27;s fiery proclamations to the people, 
* Thomas Kecskés (Tamás Kecskés) from Aszaló, 
* Francis Bagos (Ferenc Bagos),
* Anthony Nagy (Antal Nagy), the leader of the Kalocsa crusaders, nobleman from Sárköz,
* Benedict Pogány (Benedek Pogány),
* Ambrose Száleresi (Ambrus Száleresi), a well-to-do citizen of Pest.

===Social Goals===
Based on the research of professor Sándor Márki, Dózsa and his co-elected senior fellows wanted to reform the church and the political system fundamentally. They aimed to have a single elected bishop for the entire country and to make all priests equal in rank. They also wanted to abolish the nobility and distribute the lands of the nobility and the Catholic Church equally among the peasants. They decided that there should be only two orders: the city bourgeoise (merchants and craftsmen) and the peasants, and they also wanted to abolish the kingdom as a form of government. Dózsa himself only wanted to be the warlord and representative of the people: subordinating himself in everything to the decisions of the people.

The formerly peasant origin Franciscan friars became the ideologues of the uprising. With their help, Dózsa effectively threatened to excommunicate the religiously minded peasant soldiers in his army if they betrayed their &quot;holy crusader movement&quot; and their &quot;just&quot; social goals.

==Growing rebellion==


The rebellion became more dangerous when the towns joined on the side of the peasants. In Buda and elsewhere, the cavalry sent against them were unhorsed as they passed through the gates.

The army was not exclusively composed of peasants of Hungarian nationality. A part of the army, about 40%, was made up of Slovaks and Rusyns from Upper Hungary, Romanians from Transylvania, Serbs from the South, and there may have been Germans, but the latter were very few in number. After the news spread about Dózsa&#x27;s first victories, peasant riots took place in most places in the country, in which peasants of other nationalities, such as Slovaks, Germans, Croats, Slovenes or Serbs, also took part.

The rebellion spread quickly, principally in the central or purely Magyar provinces, where hundreds of manor houses and castles were burnt and thousands of the lower untitled gentry noblemen were killed by impalement, crucifixion, and other methods. Dózsa&#x27;s camp at Cegléd was the centre of the &quot;jacquerie&quot;, as all raids in the surrounding area started out from there.

In reaction, the papal bull was revoked, and King Vladislaus issued a proclamation commanding the peasantry to return to their homes under pain of death. By this time, the uprising had attained the dimensions of a revolution; all the vassals of the kingdom were called out against it, and soldiers of fortune were hired in haste from the Republic of Venice, Bohemia, and the Holy Roman Empire. Meanwhile, Dózsa had captured the city and fortress of Csanád (today&#x27;s Cenad), and signalled his victory by impaling the bishop and the castellan.

Subsequently, at Arad, Lord Treasurer István Telegdy was seized and tortured to death. In general, however, the rebels only executed particularly vicious or greedy noblemen; those who freely submitted were released on parole. Dózsa not only never broke his given word, but frequently assisted the escape of fugitives. He was unable to consistently control his followers, however, and many of them hunted down rivals.

==Downfall and execution==

In the course of the summer, Dózsa seized the fortresses of Arad, Lippa (today Lipova), and Világos (now Şiria), and provided himself with cannons and trained gunners. One of his bands advanced to within 25 kilometres of the capital. But his ill-armed ploughmen were outmatched by the heavy cavalry of the nobles. Dózsa himself had apparently become demoralized by success: after Csanád, he issued proclamations which can be described as nihilistic.

As his suppression had become a political necessity, Dózsa was routed at Temesvár (today Timișoara, Romania) on 15 July 1514 by an army of 20,000 led by John Zápolya and Stephen Báthory. He was captured after the battle, and condemned to sit on a smouldering, heated iron throne, and forced to wear a heated iron crown and sceptre (mocking his ambition to be king). While he was suffering, a procession of nine fellow rebels who had been starved beforehand were led to this throne. In the lead was Dózsa&#x27;s younger brother, Gergely, who was cut in three despite Dózsa asking for Gergely to be spared. Next, executioners removed some pliers from a fire and forced them into Dózsa&#x27;s skin. After tearing his flesh, the remaining rebels were ordered to bite spots where the hot pliers had been inserted and to swallow the flesh. The three or four who refused were simply cut up, prompting the others to comply. In the end, Dózsa died from the ordeal, while the rebels who obeyed were released and left alone.

The revolt was repressed but some 70,000 peasants were tortured. György&#x27;s execution, and the brutal suppression of the peasants, greatly aided the 1526 Ottoman invasion as the Hungarians were no longer a politically united people and peasants rejected military service against the Ottomans. Another consequence was the creation of new laws, an effort in the Hungarian Diet led by István Werbőczy. The resulting Tripartitum elaborated the old rights of peasants, but also greatly enhanced the status of lesser nobility (gentry), erecting an iron curtain between Hungarians until 1848 when serfdom was abolished.

==Legacy==
The often biased historiography of the nobility later often claimed that the memory of György Dózsa served as a role model for other great peasant uprisings on the territory of the Hungarian crown, such as the revolt of Jovan of Czerni, which took place barely twelve years after the Dózsa War, and the peasant uprising in Croatia led by Ambroz Gubec in 1572–1573.

Today, on the site of the martyrdom of the hot throne, there is the Virgin Mary Monument, built by architect László Székely and sculptor György Kiss. According to the legend, during György Dózsa&#x27;s torture, some friars saw in his ear the image of Mary. The first statue was raised in 1865, with the actual monument raised in 1906. Hungarian opera composer Ferenc Erkel wrote an opera, &quot;Dózsa György&quot;, about him.

His revolutionary image and Transylvanian background were drawn upon during the Communist regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. The Hungarian component of his movement was downplayed, but its strong anti-feudal character was emphasized.

In Budapest, a square, a busy six-lane avenue, and a metro station bear his name, and it is one of the most popular street names in Hungarian villages. A number of streets in several cities of Romania were named &quot;Gheorghe Doja&quot;. Also, a number of streets in several cities of Serbia were named &quot;Ulica Doža Đerđa&quot;.
Two Postage stamps were issued in his honour by Hungary on 12 June 1919 and on 15 March 1947, the latter in the &quot;social revolutionists&quot; series.

<text>Michael Leo Hilliard (11 March 1903 – 3 August 1982) was an Irish revolutionary and later Fianna Fáil politician.

==Early life and revolutionary period==
He was born 11 March 1903 in Navan, County Meath, fifth child of James Hilliard, a farmer and cattle dealer, and Mary Hilliard (née O&#x27;Brien). He was educated at St Finian&#x27;s College, Mullingar, he left in 1920 to take part in the IRA&#x27;s independence campaign. As Company Captain of Navan Company, 4 Battalion, 2 Meath Brigade, in 1920 he was involved in enforcing the Belfast boycott, arms raids, blocking roads and burning of Robinstown Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks. In February 1921, Hilliard claims to have taken part in the execution of a suspected spy named “Chandeler” (sic) in Navan who was masquerading as a Michael O’Brien from Silvermines trying to join the IRA. In April 1921 was promoted to brigade intelligence officer and later Brigade Commandant. Hillard fought on the side of the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War.

He was arrested on 15 July 1922 but managed to escape soon after from Dundalk Jail with over 100 other IRA men. Hilliard took part in attacks on National forces until recapture in January 1923. During imprisonment, he went on hunger strike for 35 days. He recalled the experience as &quot;a tremendous experience to have. Your mind gets crystal clear and you [are] in a sort in an ecstasy after about 21 days. You have day dreams and night dreams, you have such beautiful dreams. I can’t really explain it, but you can recall it as if you were looking at a film as to what happened to you from the very early days of your life&quot;. Hilliard was released in July 1924 and remained active in the IRA until about 1932, when he left to join Fianna Fáil. Hilliard later applied to the Irish government for a service pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934 and was awarded 5 and 1/6 years service in 1941 at Grade C for his service with the IRA between 1 April 1920 and 30 September 1923.

==Political career==
From 1934 he represented the party on Navan Urban District Council. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Meath–Westmeath constituency at the 1943 general election. During his career he served in the governments of Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch. During his tenure as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs Hilliard oversaw the introduction of a television service in Ireland, RTÉ. He served as Minister for Defence from 1965 to 1969.

He retained his Dáil seat at eight further general elections, switching to the Meath constituency after constituencies were revised for the 1948 general election. However, at the 1973 general election, he lost his seat to his party colleague Brendan Crinion. He did not contest any further Dáil elections.

While a TD in 1973, Hilliard was appointed a Member of the European Parliament as part of Ireland&#x27;s short-lived first delegation.

His son Colm Hilliard was Fianna Fáil TD for Meath from 1982 to 1997.

<text>USS &quot;Alexandria&quot; (SSN-757), is a nuclear-powered attack submarine and the third vessel of the United States Navy to be named for both Alexandria, Virginia, and Alexandria, Louisiana. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation on 26 November 1984. Her keel was laid down in Groton, Connecticut, on 19 June 1987. She was launched on 23 June 1990, sponsored by Mrs. Myrtle &quot;Tookie&quot; Clark, wife of Vice Admiral Glenwood Clark (ret.), and commissioned on 29 June 1991. &quot;Alexandria&quot; was placed in service on 22 March 1991. A series of sea trials began 16 April and were completed 4 June.

== Service history ==
&quot;Alexandria&quot;, together with the guided-missile cruiser , guided-missile frigate , and P-3C Orion maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, participated in Exercise Malabar 2004, a training exercise with the Indian Navy off the southwest coast of India that ended on 11 October 2004.

In March 2007 &quot;Alexandria&quot; was participating in the joint U.S. Navy/Royal Navy Ice Exercise 2007 (ICEX-2007), conducted in the Arctic Ocean with the . The exercise took place on and under a drifting ice floe, about off the north coast of Alaska. The two submarines were taking part in joint testing of submarine operability and tactical development in Arctic waters. On 21 March 2007, &quot;Tireless&quot; experienced an explosion of a self-contained oxygen generation candle, she suffered only superficial damage, but two crew members were killed and one injured.

;Kristian Saucier Incident

On 19 August 2016, Navy machinist mate Kristian Saucier, 29, was sentenced by a U.S. District Court judge in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to one year in prison plus six months house arrest for taking and possessing six cell phone photos of &quot;Alexandria&#x27;s&quot; classified propulsion system while working in her engine room in 2009. Invoking the so-called &quot;Clinton defense,&quot; his attorneys had argued for leniency by citing the FBI&#x27;s decision not to charge Hillary Clinton for similar crimes of mishandling classified information related to her use of a private email server. On 5 September 2017, having received an other-than-honorable discharge from the Navy, Saucier was released from jail.

;Film set
Some scenes for the movie &quot;&quot; were filmed on board &quot;Alexandria&quot;. The then-captain of &quot;Alexandria&quot;, Commander Mike Bernacchi, and members of his crew played themselves. The ship was also used as a filming location for the &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot; TV series, although she was referred to there as the fictional USS &quot;Cathedral City&quot;.

<doc id="1076714" wikidata="Q1759693" url="?curid=1076714" title="South Boston">
<text>South Boston (colloquially Southie) is a densely populated neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, located south and east of the Fort Point Channel and abutting Dorchester Bay. It has undergone several demographic transformations since being annexed to the city of Boston in 1804. The neighborhood, once primarily farmland, is popularly known by its twentieth century identity as a working class Irish Catholic community. Throughout the twenty-first century, the neighborhood has become increasingly popular with millennial professionals.

South Boston contains Dorchester Heights, where George Washington forced British troops to evacuate during the American Revolutionary War. South Boston has undergone gentrification, and consequently, its real estate market has seen property values join the highest in the city. South Boston has also left its mark on history with Boston busing desegregation. South Boston is also home to the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, a celebration of the Irish-American culture and the Evacuation Day observance.

== History ==


Geographically, Dorchester Neck was an isthmus, a narrow strip of land that connected the mainland of the colonial settlement of Dorchester with Dorchester Heights. Landfill has since greatly increased the amount of land on the eastern side of the historical neck, and widened the connection to the mainland to the point that South Boston is no longer considered separate from it. South Boston gained an identity separate from Dorchester, but the two were annexed by Boston in pieces, from 1804 to 1870.

During the American Revolutionary War, George Washington placed a cannon on Dorchester Heights, thereby forcing the evacuation of British troops from Boston on March 17, 1776. The British evacuated Boston and Fort William and Mary for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Fort William and Mary was replaced with a brick fortification known as Fort Independence. That fort was replaced by a granite fortification (bearing the same name) prior to the American Civil War, and still stands on Castle Island as a National Historic Landmark. Edgar Allan Poe was stationed at Castle Island for five months in 1827 and was inspired to write &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; based on an early Castle Island legend.

During the 1970s, South Boston received national attention for its opposition to court-mandated school (de facto) desegregation by busing students to different neighborhoods.

In the early 21st century, property values, especially in the City Point neighborhood near Castle Island, rose to the level of some of the highest in the city. The City Point area of South Boston, labeled &quot;East Side&quot; by realtors, has seen a major increase in property values due to its close proximity to downtown Boston and gentrification. The &quot;West Side&quot; of South Boston, also known as the &quot;lower end&quot; by lifelong residents, though slower to begin the gentrification process also benefits from the proximity to not only downtown but also the popular South End. Additionally, the West Side is home to the first green residence (Gold LEED certified) in Boston — the Macallen Building which was featured in the movie &quot;The Greening of Southie&quot;. The City of Boston is investing in the West Side through developments like the ~ mixed use (residential and commercial) building being developed by the Boston Redevelopment Authority on West Broadway.

=== Harrison Loring House ===
The 1865 Harrison Loring House is a Second Empire brick mansion located in South Boston. It was used as a private residence until 1913. At that time it was purchased by the Roman Catholic Church to use the space as a convent. The house located at 789 East Broadway was designated a Boston Landmark in 1981. It is associated with Harrison Loring, who owned and operated one of the first South Boston shipyards.

=== St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade ===

The history behind the South Boston Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade is General Henry Knox brought 55 cannons captured at Fort Ticonderoga. In March, the troops positioned the cannons on Dorchester Heights. They had cut down trees to cannon size, hollowed them out and blackened them over fire to look like cannons. Surprise was just around the corner. On March 17, 1776, orders were given that if you wished to pass through the continental lines, the password was &quot;St. Patrick&quot;. The British had seen all the cannons on the Heights and left Boston.

Evacuation Day was declared a holiday in the City of Boston in 1901. In celebration, the city hosted a parade based in South Boston. The Dorchester Heights Monument, a tribute to the historical event, was completed in Dorchester Heights in 1902. Major George F. H. Murray served as Chief Marshall for the parade in 1901. The state of Massachusetts recognized Evacuation Day as a holiday in Suffolk County (but not the rest of the state) in 1938. The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade is both a celebration of the Irish-American culture in Boston and the Evacuation Day victory. The City of Boston sponsored the event until 1947, when Mayor James Michael Curley gave authority to the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council.

Politicians and local celebrities have participated in these annual Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade for years. In 1958, Senator John F. Kennedy rode with Jacqueline Kennedy in the parade. The Kennedy family were well known as participating in this parade. Robert F. Kennedy marched in 1968, Ted and Joan Kennedy also marched in 1970. The N.A.A.C.P entered a float in the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in 1964. In the mid-1960s Harvard&#x27;s Irish Society joined the march. Irish nationalists unofficially marched in the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1972, Irish Republican Aid Committee members protested violence in Northern Ireland during the Troubles by carrying a coffin draped with the Irish tricolored flag. The Boston chapter of the Irish Northern Aid Commission marched with black armbands and a sign reading &quot;England Get out of Ireland&quot;. 

The year 1976 marked the 200th anniversary of Evacuation Day and the 75th anniversary of the parade. A reenactment of the 1776 evacuation was incorporated into the parade, with fireworks and period costumes. President George H. W. Bush declared March Irish-American Heritage Month in 1991. The application of the Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, or GLIB, to march in the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in 1992, the first of its kind in the history of the parade, was met with a rejection by the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council. In recent years, parade organizers have tried to make the event more kid-friendly, by incorporating &quot;family zones&quot; or sober places to watch the parade. The South Boston, St. Patrick&#x27;s Parade is listed as the second-largest parade in the country, being viewed by nearly 600,000 to 1 million people every year, in addition to having the entire parade seen on live television.

In the 1990s, South Boston became the focus for a U.S. Supreme Court case on the right of gay and lesbian groups to participate in the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day (Evacuation Day) parade. The case was decided in favor of the parade&#x27;s sponsors when the Supreme Court supported the South Boston Allied War Veterans&#x27; right to determine who can participate in their annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade. In 1996 local Dorchester author Paul Walkowski and Attorney William Connolly detailed the case in their book &quot;From Trial Court to the United States Supreme Court&quot;.

Today, the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade marches from West Broadway to East Broadway, finishing at Farragut Road. Every year, from 10,000 to 20,000 participants join the parade.

== Demographics ==

South Boston became known as an Irish working-class neighborhood when large numbers of Irish immigrants settled there in the mid-nineteenth century and continued to do so throughout the twentieth. Once a predominantly Irish Catholic community, in recent years South Boston has become increasingly desirable among young professionals and families who are attracted to the neighborhood&#x27;s strong sense of community and quick access to downtown and public transportation. South Boston has a population of about 33,311. The median age is about 32.

The most recent census estimates South Boston&#x27;s total population at 33,688. The Caucasian population is about 26,700 (79.2%). A total amount of 2,789 (8.3%) Hispanic people is counted. African American population is about 1,926 (5.7%). The Asian population makes up 4.8% (1,603). 466 people are of non-Hispanic mixed race (1.4%) and 190 people (0.6%)
are identified as Others (i.e. American Indians and groups not otherwise categorized).

== Seaport District ==

Development in the Seaport has boomed during the early 21st century. It was considered &quot;the hottest, fastest-growing real estate market in the country&quot; in 2014. , it was the fastest growing part of Boston and has stimulated significant economic growth in the city. The restoration of the Seaport began with the completion of the Big Dig. This $14.6 billion project buried the formerly elevated Central Artery I-93 Interstate which previously cut off the waterfront from the rest of the city.

In May 2010, Mayor Menino announced plans for the city to develop 1,000 acres on the South Boston Waterfront as an Innovation District. Inspired by the success of the 22@ model, the mayor&#x27;s vision was to redevelop the then-mostly abandoned Seaport District into a hub for Information Age jobs and a new frontier for cutting-edge industries such as clean tech, health care information technology and mobile media. Between Menino&#x27;s announcement in 2010 and 2017, 5,000 new jobs were created and over 200 new companies have formed. Forty percent of the companies located in the Innovation District share space in co-working spaces and incubators. Over 1,100 housing units were constructed, including 300 innovation micro-units.

The housing facilities are under the control of the Boston Housing Authority (BHA) and include West Broadway which was built in 1949 and occupies , West Ninth Street (these three facilities are next to each other and commonly called D street), Old Colony which was built in 1941, and Mary Ellen McCormack, which is the BHA&#x27;s oldest development, being constructed in 1936. It was originally called Old Harbor Village.

Other developments are Harbor Point (in Dorchester), Foley and Monsignor Powers.

As of the June 26, 2014, city officials and civilians officially celebrated the completion of the second phase of construction and redevelopment of the Old Colony housing project that took place in the neighborhood of South Boston that began construction back in 2009. The phase two completion included high-efficiency affordable housing in town-house style and four-story elevator buildings. Part of this project was funded by a HOPE VI grant which ensured $22-million for the project to build these new public houses for the citizens of South Boston, replacing 223 original apartments along Old Colony Avenue up to Dorchester Street and over to Reverend Burke Street which were demolished. These new, affordable housing units are some of the most environmentally-friendly public houses in the entire Commonwealth. In the future, the Boston Housing Authority and its partners are looking to redevelop the remaining 453 original housing units in South Boston.

<doc id="1076750" wikidata="Q82226" url="?curid=1076750" title="Ellen (TV series)">
<text>Ellen is an American television sitcom that aired on ABC from March 29, 1994, to July 22, 1998, consisting of 109 episodes. Ellen DeGeneres stars as the title character of Ellen Morgan, a neurotic bookstore owner in her thirties. The title of the series was These Friends of Mine for the first season, but it was subsequently changed to avoid confusion with the NBC series &quot;Friends&quot;, which premiered in September 1994.

The series centered on Ellen&#x27;s dealing with her quirky friends, her family, and the problems of daily life, set in Los Angeles. The series was one of the first in the US with a main character to come out as gay, which DeGeneres&#x27; character did in the 1997 episode &quot;The Puppy Episode&quot;, which aired shortly after DeGeneres publicly revealed that she was gay in real life. This event received a great deal of media exposure, ignited controversy, and prompted ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.

The series&#x27; theme song (used in season 3 onwards) is a version of &quot;So Called Friend&quot; by Scottish band Texas with altered lyrics. A running gag during the third and fourth seasons was that each episode had a distinct/different opening credits sequence (often with singing and dancing and featuring popular celebrities as guest stars), resulting from Ellen&#x27;s ongoing search for the perfect opening credits.

==Cast and characters==
===Overview===
† Though listed in many sources as a main character for the season indicated, this character actually only appeared in approximately half the season&#x27;s episodes.

===Main===
Note: Between seasons one and two, there was not only a title change from &quot;These Friends of Mine&quot; to &quot;Ellen&quot;, but two main characters disappeared without explanation.

* Ellen DeGeneres as Ellen Inez Morgan: Ellen is the main character of the sitcom. In season one, Ellen works in a Los Angeles bookstore called &quot;Buy the Book&quot;. In the second season, she purchases the bookstore from her boss and becomes its owner. Throughout season four, hints were made to her sexuality and near the end of season 4 in &quot;The Puppy Episode,&quot; Ellen announced she was a lesbian. For the first one and a half seasons, Ellen lived in an apartment with roommate Adam. She lived alone after Adam moved out and then with her cousin Spence. Towards the end of season four, she bought her own house. Ellen&#x27;s personality was likable and cheerful, but also somewhat clumsy and awkward, and with a persistent need to be liked. Her trademark behavior (and the main object of her comedy) was that she would digress, rambling and babbling, especially when nervous or embarrassed. An example of both her clumsiness and her need to please is found in the episode where she had Martha Stewart over for a dinner party and Ellen became highly stressed trying to organize the perfect dinner. 
* Joely Fisher as Paige Clarke: Appearing in seasons two through five, Paige is Ellen&#x27;s somewhat vain and promiscuous best friend who works for a movie studio. Paige planned to tie the knot with her boyfriend Matt Liston, but dumped him at the altar after resuming an affair she had with Ellen&#x27;s cousin Spence. When Ellen comes out of the closet, Paige has the hardest time dealing with it (even harder than Ellen&#x27;s parents). In the fourth-season finale, Paige finally comes to terms with it. Paige also likes to try on clothes and work on her singing voice. Her singing voice is powerful enough to blow things off tables, as seen in season 2 episode 13. (s. 2-5)
* David Anthony Higgins as Joe Farrell: Appearing in all five seasons, Joe is a dour, sarcastic Canadian who works as the barista at the coffee shop inside Ellen&#x27;s bookstore. His personal life is only touched upon, usually for comic relief in constant reference to misadventures he had in Moose Jaw. In the third season he becomes a member of the core group which aside from him consists of Ellen, Spence, Paige, and Audrey. (Recurring Season 1, Main cast Seasons 2-5)
* Clea Lewis as Audrey Penney: Audrey is Ellen&#x27;s squeaky-voiced and exceedingly perky neighbor and later co-worker, seen usually in the color pink and whose catchphrase was the enthusiastic greeting &quot;Hi, Ellen!&quot; Ellen has something of a love–hate relationship with Audrey, often annoyed at her overly upbeat demeanor. But after Ellen comes out, Audrey is extremely supportive (and excited, saying that she thinks &quot;it&#x27;s SUPER!&quot;), and she throws herself into the LGBT culture, ironically with more reverence than Ellen did. In her initial appearance in the first season, her personality and appearance were quite different, and Ellen complained about Audrey&#x27;s dour and negative personality, but upon her reappearance later in season two she has developed her upbeat and perky demeanor. In season one, Ellen also refers to Audrey&#x27;s husband, but he never appears, their off-screen divorce between seasons one and two possibly explaining Audrey&#x27;s change of personality, and Audrey later dates several people, including Adam and Ron Palillo. It is revealed that she comes from a very well-off family, though she rejected her inheritance so that she could continue being an assistant at the bookstore. (Guest Season 1, Recurring Season 2, Main cast Seasons 3-5)
* Jeremy Piven as Spencer &quot;Spence&quot; Kovak: Ellen&#x27;s volatile but well-intentioned cousin from New York, who joined the cast in the third season. His arrival in Ellen&#x27;s life coincides with the aftermath of a large Los Angeles earthquake that leads to the destruction and subsequent remodeling of the bookstore. Spence was training as a doctor, but was fired from his job for punching a patient and as a result spent the beginning of the third season bored and depressed. He begins training as a lawyer but after saving someone&#x27;s life decides to resume his career in medicine. He and Paige had a love-hate relationship that began as constant fighting but later they became lovers and stayed such until a few episodes before the end of the series when the relationship ended amicably. (S. 3-5)

She in turn lies that she has one on him too, but he finds out the truth and that creates tension between the two of them until shortly before he leaves. (Seasons 1-3)
* Holly Fulger as Holly Jamison: Appearing only in the first season, Holly is Ellen&#x27;s friend. Shy and self-conscious, she tries to avoid any trouble and is desperate to get along with the people around her.

==Episodes==

===&quot;The Puppy Episode&quot;===
In 1997, &quot;Ellen&quot; made U.S. television history when the title character came out as a lesbian in the famous &quot;Puppy Episode&quot; (DeGeneres herself came out concurrent with the episode on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and in &quot;Time&quot;). To ensure a memorable moment, the coming out scene was made into a gag where, at an airport, Ellen turns and tells Laura Dern&#x27;s character &quot;I&#x27;m gay!&quot; – only to realize that she had turned right into the public address microphone, announcing her sexuality to the entire terminal. Ellen DeGeneres&#x27;s mother Betty can briefly be seen as one of the people in the terminal with a shocked reaction to the announcement.

The episode was ranked No. 46 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.

The revelation ignited a storm of controversy, prompting ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.

&quot;Ellen&quot; was successful enough in its early seasons to warrant annual renewal, due largely to DeGeneres&#x27;s perceived appeal and comic ability, but only with Ellen&#x27;s coming out did the show make its way into the wide public consciousness and hit a critical plateau. After the initial coming out frenzy, however, the show&#x27;s ratings declined, and ABC began feeling the pain of a backlash regarding the &quot;gay content&quot; being exhibited. The final episodes of &quot;Ellen&quot; were criticized for focusing too much on gay issues. Eventually, even some members of the LGBT community, including Chaz Bono (who at the time was the media director for GLAAD), began to criticize the show&#x27;s serious new tone as well. ABC cancelled the show in May 1998 after five seasons.

===Viva Las Vegas===
The episode &quot;Secrets &amp; Ellen&quot; is part of a crossover with &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Coach&quot;, and &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; set in Las Vegas. It features Brett Butler as Grace Kelly and Drew Carey as himself.

==Broadcast history==

<doc id="1076759" wikidata="Q1913796" url="?curid=1076759" title="Maxell">
<text>, commonly known as Maxell, is a Japanese company that manufactures consumer electronics.

The company&#x27;s name is a contraction of &quot;Maximum capacity dry cell&quot;. Its main products are batteries, wireless charging products, storage devices, (USB flash drive, with real capacity 4- 8- 16- 32- 64- 128- 256GB)  LCD/laser projectors, and functional materials. In the past, the company manufactured recording media, including audio cassettes and blank VHS tapes, floppy disks, and recordable optical discs including CD-R/RW and DVD±RW.

On March 4, 2008, Maxell announced that they would outsource the manufacturing of their optical media.

== History ==
Maxell was formed in 1960, when a dry cell manufacturing plant was created at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Ibaraki, Osaka. In 1961, Maxell Electric Industrial Company, Limited was created out of the dry battery and magnetic tape divisions of Nitto Electric Industrial Company, Limited (now Nitto Denko Corporation).

On March 18, 2014, the company was listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In 2013, Maxell, Ltd. acquired Hitachi Consumer Electronics, Co., Ltd.&#x27;s projector design, development and manufacturing assets and resources. On October 1, 2019, Maxell Corporation of America announced it would assume responsibility for all operations related to both Hitachi- brand and Maxell-brand projector products and accessories in the North American market.

== Products ==

=== Batteries ===
Maxell, along with Nagasaki University, NIAIST, and Subaru Corporation (the parent company of Subaru, makers of the R1e electric car), has developed a new chemistry for lithium-ion batteries. Part of the change is dropping the expensive cobalt element and using &quot;nano infused lithium&quot; with manganese, with twenty times more power storage, and the ability to mass-produce it inexpensively.

=== Audio cassettes ===
During the height of the Compact Audio Cassette&#x27;s popularity, Maxell&#x27;s audio cassettes were held in high regard, producing some of the finest examples of the standard available. The performance of the XLII-S (CrO2) and MX (pure metal particles) cassettes was highly regarded in the pre-digital domestic recording medium.

Until the beginning of 2020, Maxell still produced UR ferric-oxide-based cassettes for the international market. Maxell has since stopped distributing their UR cassettes outside of Japan. However in 2023 Maxell has started producing and selling UR cassettes outside of Japan on online marketplaces such as Amazon. 

=== Optical storages ===
Since November 2006 the Taiwanese Ritek corporation became exclusive producer of Maxell CD-Rs and DVDs.

=== LCD and laser projectors ===
Maxell now assumes responsibility for all Hitachi-brand and Maxell-brand LCD projectors and laser projectors, as well as the Lecture Capture Collaboration Station. Maxell projectors are available in a range of lumens, resolutions, sizes, and colors for classrooms, conference rooms, houses of worship, and venues.

== Advertising ==
&quot;Blown Away&quot; (US)

In the 1980s, Maxell became an icon of pop culture when it produced advertisements popularly known as &quot;Blown Away Guy&quot; for its line of audio cassettes. The campaign began as a two-page advertising spread in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1980. The photo shows a man sitting low in a (Le Corbusier Grand Confort LC2) high armed chair (on the right side of the spread) in front of, and facing, a JBL L100 speaker (the left side of the spread). His hair and necktie, along with the lampshade to the man&#x27;s right and the martini glass on the low table to the man&#x27;s left, are being blown back by the tremendous sound from speakers in front of him—supposedly due to the audio accuracy of Maxell&#x27;s product. The man is shown desperately clinging to the armrests but defiantly looking ahead at the source of the music through sunglasses.

The ad campaign was conceived by Art Director Lars Anderson. Steve Steigman was the photographer. Steigman wanted a male model with long hair in order to show the effect of the wind, but when such a model could not be found on the day of the shoot, they used the makeup artist who was hired for the shoot, Jac Colello.

The same concept was used for television spots in 1981 which ran throughout the 1980s. These commercials showed nearly the same image as the print ad, but with the chair, a drink and nearby lamp all being pushed away from the stereo by the strong force of the sound waves, though the man calmly catches his drink before it slides off the end table. Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; was used for music.

The &quot;blown away guy&quot; image became quite popular, and has been copied and parodied numerous times, including in the 1992 John Ritter film &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; (where a character&#x27;s head is blown off by a &quot;Max-Hell&quot; tape), in the 1995 episode &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot; of the animated Sitcom the Simpsons, in the 2005 episode &quot;Model Misbehavior&quot; of animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and in the 2010 movie &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, where Ryan Dunn sits in a chair while the blast from a jet engine sends the set blowing away. The comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot; also parodied the ad in showing one of its characters, Milo Bloom, at home watching MTV.

In 2005, Maxell revived the &quot;Blown Away Guy&quot; ad campaign. As Maxell now made blank DVDs and CDs, headphones, speakers, and blank audio and video tape, the ads were updated with photos of iPods and accessories underneath the image. &quot;Get blown away&quot; was the headline, while the copy urged consumers to use Maxell accessories to &quot;make your small iPod sound like a huge audio system&quot;.
&quot;Misheard&quot; (UK)

In 1989, advertising agency HHCL was commissioned by Hitachi Maxell to make two UK TV advertisements for its audio cassette range. Both feature music fans, dressed appropriately for each genre, listening to two popular songs but mishearing the lyrics. The fans peel away cue cards, copying the style of Bob Dylan in Dont Look Back. The first ad uses the Desmond Dekker song &quot;Israelites&quot;, with the second using &quot;Into The Valley&quot; by The Skids. In both ads, the conclusion is that if the songs were recorded on Maxell tapes, the fidelity would be much greater and the proper lyrics could be heard. 

Additionally, a separate ad on the theme of the American &quot;Blown Away&quot; campaign was filmed for the UK, with musician Peter Murphy of the group Bauhaus as the man in the chair, and &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; by Modest Mussorgsky as the music.

<doc id="1076765" wikidata="Q662914" url="?curid=1076765" title="Districts of Switzerland">
<text>Districts of Switzerland are a political subdivision for cantons. In the federally constituted Switzerland, each canton is completely free to decide its own internal organisation. Therefore, there exists a variety of structures and terminology for the subnational entities between canton and municipality, loosely termed districts. Most cantons are divided into &quot;Bezirke&quot; (German for districts, singular &quot;Bezirk&quot;). They are also termed &quot;Ämter&quot; (Lucerne, singular &quot;Amt&quot;), &quot;Amtsbezirke&quot; (Bern, &quot;Amtsbezirk&quot;), &quot;district&quot; (in French) or &quot;distretto&quot; (Ticino and part of Graubünden). The &quot;Bezirke&quot; generally provide only administration and court organization. However, for historical reasons districts in cantons Grisons and Schwyz are their own legal entities with jurisdiction over tax and often have their own Landsgemeinde.

Seven of the 26 cantons – Uri, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Glarus, Zug, Basel-City and Geneva – have always existed without the district level of government. An eighth one, Appenzell Innerrhoden, uses no intermediate level either, but calls its lowest-level subdivisions &quot;Bezirke,&quot; although they are functionally equivalent to municipalities elsewhere.

A further number of cantons are considering (or have already decided) an abolition of the district level in the future. Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Schaffhausen, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Schwyz voted in 2006 on its abolition; some voted in favour of keeping the division, some with modifications. Bern in 2006 decided a reduction of its 26 districts to 10 districts to be overseen by 5 regions, which took effect in 2010. St. Gallen, Solothurn and Lucerne removed the administrative role, but retained districts for elections. In 2008 Vaud decided on a reduction from 19 to 10 districts, followed by Thurgau which combined eight into five in 2012. In 2017 Grisons replaced the 11 districts with 11 regions. In 2018 Neuchâtel eliminated the district level.

==Zurich==

The canton of Zurich is divided into 12 districts (German: &quot;Bezirke&quot;):

==Bern==

The Canton of Bern is divided in five &quot;regions&quot;: Berner Jura, Seeland (with two precincts, Biel/Bienne and Seeland), Bern-Mittelland, Oberland (with precincts Thun, Obersimmental-Saanen, Frutigen-Niedersimmental, Interlaken-Oberhasli) and Emmental-Oberaargau (with two precincts, Emmental and Oberaargau)
The current division has taken effect on 1 January 2010, based on a 2006 decision to abolish the former system of districts.

On 1 January 2010, the 26 administrative districts (&quot;Amtsbezirke&quot;) lost their administrative role that was transferred to 10 new administrative districts (&quot;Verwaltungskreise&quot;):

*Bern-Mittelland with capital Ostermundigen, made up of all or part of the former districts of Bern, Fraubrunnen, Konolfingen, Laupen, Schwarzenburg and Seftigen
*Biel/Bienne with capital Biel/Bienne, made up of all of the former district of Biel and about half of the former district of Nidau
*Emmental with capital Langnau im Emmental, made up of all or part of the former districts of Burgdorf, Signau and Trachselwald
*Frutigen-Niedersimmental with capital Frutigen, made up of all or part of the former districts of Frutigen and Niedersimmental
*Interlaken-Oberhasli with capital Interlaken, made up of all or part of the former districts of Interlaken and Oberhasli
*Jura bernois with capital Courtelary, made up of all or part of the former districts of Courtelary, Moutier and La Neuveville
*Oberaargau with capital Wangen an der Aare, made up of all or part of the former districts of Aarwangen and Wangen
*Obersimmental-Saanen with capital Saanen, made up of all of the former districts of Obersimmental and Saanen
*Seeland with capital Aarberg, made up of all or part of the former districts of Aarberg, Büren, Erlach and Nidau
*Thun with capital Thun, made up of all of the former administrative district of Thun

&quot;Nota bene&quot; that the 26 Bernese districts do still formally exist and are maintained by Article 38 of the Law on the Organisation of the Executive Council and the Administration (Organization Law, LOCA/OrG) and by Article 3 al.2 of the cantonal Constitution.

<text>Los Millares is a Chalcolithic occupation site 17 km north of Almería, in the municipality of Santa Fe de Mondújar, Andalucía, Spain. The complex was in use from the fourth millennium BC () to the end of the third millennium BC (2000 BC) and probably supported somewhere around 1000 people. It was discovered in 1891 during the construction of a railway. It was first excavated by Luis Siret in the succeeding years. Excavations are ongoing. Los Millares is the type site of the Chalcolithic Millaran culture.

==Site description==

The site covers and comprises three concentric lines of stone walls, the outer ring the largest, running more than 200 meters (650 feet) with nineteen &#x27;bastions&#x27; and a gate guarded by foreworks. The road to the site is guarded by four smaller outlying stone forts. There is an extensive cemetery of eighty passage grave tombs. Radiocarbon dating has established that one wall collapsed and was rebuilt around 3025 BC.

A cluster of simple dwellings lay inside the walls as well as one large building containing evidence of copper smelting. Pottery excavated from the site included plain and decorated wares including symbolkeramik bowls bearing oculus motifs. Similar designs appear on various carved stone idols found at the site. Although primarily farmers, the inhabitants of Los Millares had crucially also learned metal working, especially the smelting and forming of copper, and the site is considered highly important in understanding the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. The Millaran culture eventually came to dominate the Iberian peninsula.

The population of Los Millares has been estimated at approximately 1000 in the timeframe 3200–2300 BC.
The labor involved in its construction, the large volume of stones used, its geometric characteristics and sophisticated design all indicate multiple functionality, including defense and power.

==Relationship to other prehistoric cultures==
Los Millares participated in the continental trends of Megalithism and the Beaker culture . Analysis of occupation material and grave goods from the Los Millares cemetery of 70 &quot;tholos&quot; tombs with port-hole slabs has led archaeologists to suggest that the people who lived at Los Millares were part of a stratified, unequal society which was often at war with its neighbors . The Los Millares civilisation was replaced circa 1800 BC, with the arrival of Bronze by the El Argar civilisation, whose successor culture is embodied in the contemporary culture of Vila Nova de São Pedro in nearby Portugal.

Other Iberian settlements in this region of a similar age to Los Millares include the settlement of Los Silillos and Neolithic finds at .

Similarities between Los Millares architecture and the step pyramid at Monte d&#x27;Accoddi in Sardinia have been noticed .

==Conservation and access==
The site has been protected by a heritage designation, currently Bien de Interés Cultural, since 1931.

There is an interpretation centre at the site itself.
Some finds are displayed at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid, and others at the Museum of Almería.

<doc id="1076780" wikidata="Q241258" url="?curid=1076780" title="Anna Muzychuk">
<text>Anna Olehivna Muzychuk (; ; born 28 February 1990) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster (GM). She is the fourth woman in chess history to attain a FIDE rating of at least 2600. She has been ranked as high as No. 197 in the world, and No. 2 among women. Muzychuk is a three-time world champion in fast chess, having won the Women&#x27;s World Rapid Chess Championship once in 2014 and the Women&#x27;s World Blitz Chess Championship twice in 2014 and 2016. In classical chess, she was the 2017 Women&#x27;s World Championship runner-up.

Muzychuk grew up in a chess family where her younger sister Mariya (the 2015 Women&#x27;s World Champion in classical chess) also became a Grandmaster. Her parents work as chess coaches, having taught her the game from when she was two years old. She soon established herself as a chess prodigy, first winning the European Youth Chess Championships at age six in the under-8 girls&#x27; category and later winning the under-10, under-12, and under-14 girls&#x27; divisions as well. She also won the World Youth Championship in the under-16 girls&#x27; category and the World Junior Championship for under-20 girls. She earned the International Master (IM) title at age 17 and the Grandmaster title at age 21.

From 2004 to 2014, Muzychuk represented Slovenia due to conflicts with the Ukrainian Chess Federation. She won an individual gold medal at the European Women&#x27;s Team Chess Championship for Slovenia in 2011 and later won an individual gold medal at the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad in 2016 after she switched federations back to Ukraine. At the former event, she had one of the best performances of her career with a score of 8½ out of 9 and a performance rating of 2782, also earning her final GM norm. Along with Susan Polgar and Magnus Carlsen, she is one of three players to win the World Rapid and World Blitz Championships in the same year, which she achieved in 2016.

Muzychuk drew widespread media attention at the end of 2017 for boycotting the World Rapid and Blitz Championships over FIDE&#x27;s decision to hold the events in Saudi Arabia because of the country&#x27;s discriminatory policies against women.

==Early life and background==
Anna Muzychuk was born on 28 February 1990 in Lviv to Nataliya and Oleh Muzychuk. She grew up with her sister Mariya, who is two years younger, in the nearby smaller city of Stryi. Anna and Mariya both learned to play chess at age two from their parents, both of whom are professional chess coaches who studied coaching at the Lviv State Institute of Physical Culture sports school and have since worked and taught at the school. Their father originally taught them how the pieces move at a park where there was a large human-sized chess board on the ground. Anna began competing at chess at age five, finishing in second place at both her school chess tournament and the under-10 girls&#x27; division of the Lviv regional championship. By the time she was ten years old, she could defeat both of her parents. When Muzychuk was about 14 years old, she had been coached by Roman Kozel for two years. She was still attending school at Stryi Gymnasium at the time, but later stopped attending regularly. Around this time, she also briefly worked with Orest Gritsak, a Ukrainian Grandmaster (GM) who had coached top Ukrainian player Vasyl Ivanchuk. She had not had much opportunity to train with Grandmasters at this point because her family could not afford this level of coaching.

At age 14, Muzychuk switched federations from Ukraine to Slovenia due to conflicts she had with the Ukrainian Chess Federation. One of the issues she had was not being put on the Ukrainian national team or given the opportunity to compete at the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad despite winning the Ukrainian Women&#x27;s Chess Championship at age 13. Around the same time, Boris Kutin, a Slovenian who was the president of the European Chess Union, offered Muzychuk the opportunity to represent Slovenia, which she accepted. Although she played for Slovenia for the next ten years, she remained based in Ukraine.

==Chess career==
===1996–2004: Six-time European Youth champion===

Muzychuk had a long stretch of success at the European Youth Chess Championships, medalling in nine consecutive years from 1996 at age six to 2004 at age fourteen, including six gold medals. She won the under-8 girls&#x27; division in 1996, the under-10 girls&#x27; division twice in 1998 and 2000, the under-12 girls&#x27; division in 2002, and the under-14 girls&#x27; division twice in 2003 and 2004. She won three silver medals at the tournament, two in the under-10 girls&#x27; division in 1997 and 1999 behind Nana Dzagnidze and Silvia-Raluca Sgîrcea respectively, and one in the under-12 girls&#x27; division in 2001 behind Iozefina Păuleţ. At the national level, Muzychuk won the Ukrainian girls&#x27; national youth and junior championships three times, once each at the under-10 level in 2000, the under-12 level in 2002, and the under-20 level in 2004. Between those last two medals, she was the overall national women&#x27;s champion in 2003. On the global stage, Muzychuk also medalled in the girls&#x27; divisions of the World Youth Championships, earning a bronze medal at the under-10 level in 2000 behind Tan Zhongyi and Harika Dronavalli, as well as two silver medals, one at the under-12 level in 2002 behind Tan and another at the under-14 level in 2004 behind Dronavalli.

Muzychuk was awarded the titles of Woman FIDE Master (WFM) in 2001 and Woman International Master (WIM) in 2002. She earned her first FIDE rating of 2197 in July 2001 at age 11. She first participated at the European Individual Women&#x27;s Championship in 2002 at age 12, and finished with at least an even score in her first three appearances through 2004. Her performance at the 2003 edition as well as a joint first-place finish at the 17-round Lviv&#x27;s Hopes tournament later in the year helped Muzychuk reach a rating of 2300 by October 2003. She also earned a sufficient number of Woman Grandmaster (WGM) norms at these two tournaments, and was formally awarded the WGM title in 2004. At the end of June 2004, Muzychuk switched federations to Slovenia. Her 2004 European Youth gold and World Youth silver medals were among her earliest triumphs with Slovenia.

===2005–2010: World Youth and World Junior champion, International Master===
Following her many titles at the European Youth Championships, Muzychuk finally won a gold medal at the World Youth Championships in 2005 in the under-16 girls&#x27; division. She finished in clear first with an unbeaten score of 9/11, drawing with Dronavalli in the last round to clinch the title. She then had a significant rise in rating towards the end of the year to reach a rating of 2400 for January 2006. This rise predominantly resulted from good performances at the Instalplast tournament in Lviv where she had a positive score of 5½/8 against higher-rated opposition and the Slovenian Women&#x27;s League where she had a dominant score of 8/9.

Having already reached a rating of 2400, Muzychuk earned all of her International Master (IM) norms in 2006 and 2007, the first two of which as a double norm at the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad in Turin and the last of which in the Serbian Women&#x27;s League. She was awarded the IM title in 2007. One of her other best results in classical chess during these years was at the 2006 European Individual Women&#x27;s Championship, where she scored 7½/11 and finished in equal third place. In fast chess, Muzychuk won the 2007 European Women&#x27;s Blitz Chess Championship and finished second in the European Women&#x27;s Rapid Chess Championship.

Muzychuk first participated in the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship knockout tournament in 2008. As the 11th seed out of 64 competitors, she won her first round match against Maria Velcheva before being upset by 22nd seed Dronavalli in the second round in rapid tiebreaks. Over the next two years, Muzychuk first reached a rating of 2500 and then earned her first two GM norms. The first was a seven-game norm at the European Club Cup for Women in 2008. The second was a full nine-round norm at the InventiChess round robin tournament in 2009, where she had an even score against opponents with a much higher average rating of 2618, including six Grandmasters rated above 2600. During the latter event, she defeated David Howell, a GM rated 2624. She came close to another GM norm in Group B at the round robin Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee in 2010, but fell just short with a performance rating of 2580 by virtue of scoring 5½/13 against opponents with average rating of 2637. Although she could not complete the norm, she was the only player to defeat the winner of the tournament, Anish Giri. That summer, Muzychuk had her biggest triumph of the year by winning the World Junior Chess Championship for under-20 girls in Chotowa, Poland, finishing in clear first with a score of 11/13. She ended 2010 by reaching the third round of the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship, where as the 7th seed she was upset by 10th seed Ju Wenjun.

===2011–2012: Grandmaster title at age 21, 2600 rating===
Muzychuk completed the requirements for the Grandmaster title in 2011 with her third and fourth GM norms to reach the 27-game norm minimum needed. She earned a nine-game norm in the opening event of the 2011–12 FIDE Women&#x27;s Grand Prix in Rostov with a score of 5½/9, narrowly missing a norm over the full 11 games that would have been sufficient for reaching the 27-game minimum. She reached that minimum with her fourth GM norm at the European Women&#x27;s Team Chess Championships, where she scored a near-perfect 8½/9, including 6½/7 against her seven highest-rated opponents to complete the norm and earn the Grandmaster title at age 21. With this performance, her rating also rose to 2580.

Muzychuk continued to excel in 2012, reaching a career-best rating of 2606 in the middle of the year. She produced her career-best result at the European Individual Women&#x27;s Championship, scoring 8½/11 and earning a bronze medal. She had an opportunity to win the tournament with a last-round draw, but lost to Valentina Gunina. As a result, she only finished in joint first and lost to Gunina and Tatiana Kosintseva on the head-to-head tiebreak criteria. Muzychuk continued to perform well in the Grand Prix, finishing in joint first with Koneru Humpy at the Kazan event. During the event, she became the fourth woman to reach a rating of 2600 after Judit Polgár, Koneru, and Hou Yifan. Following the tournament, she reached a career-best ranking of No. 197 in the world in August and also became the second-highest-rated woman for the first time, only behind Polgár. Nonetheless, in the final standings for the overall Grand Prix, Muzychuk finished in third place behind Koneru and the winner Hou, losing out on the winner&#x27;s right to challenge for the Women&#x27;s World Championship. Later in the year, Muzychuk took part in the unrated ACP Golden Classic classical tournament in Amsterdam that followed an unusual format where games were adjourned if not completed in 40 moves. She finished with an even score, and notably defeated Krishnan Sasikiran, a Grandmaster rated 2707 at the time. At the end of the year, Muzychuk was the 3rd seed at the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship, but was upset in the second round by the 30th seed and eventual winner Anna Ushenina in rapid tiebreaks.

===2013–2016: World Rapid and World Blitz champion===

Muzychuk again generally finished towards the top of the standings in the 2013–14 FIDE Women&#x27;s Grand Prix events, but did not win any of them and ultimately finished fourth in the overall standings. She had a better result at the Tata Steel Challengers tournament in Wijk aan Zee in early 2014, where she came in fourth place with a score of 8/13, corresponding to a performance rating of 2666. With this performance, her rating rose back to 2583. After the tournament, however, her rating fell back into the mid-2500s and would not reach 2570 again until 2017 three years later. Although her performance in classical chess was in the midst of a mild decline, Muzychuk had a major result in fast chess, winning the Women&#x27;s World Blitz Championship in April. She won the tournament by a wide margin, finishing with 23/30, 2½ points ahead of Dzagnidze in second place. The championship brought her blitz rating to a career-best 2665. She had also finished in joint third place at the preceding Women&#x27;s World Rapid Championship event. The World Blitz victory was her last major triumph with Slovenia. In May 2014, Muzychuk switched federations again back to her home country of Ukraine. She stated her sister continuing to play for Ukraine as well as the new federation president Viktor Kapustin as reasons for her return. At the end of the year, she entered the Ukrainian women&#x27;s national championship for the first time since she was the 2003 champion and again won the tournament.

Muzychuk was less active in 2015. One of her highlights of the year was the Women&#x27;s World Championship, where she had her best result to date. As the third seed, she reached the quarterfinals. She knocked out 62nd seed Amina Mezioud, 30th seed Aleksandra Goryachkina, and 19th seed Lela Javakhishvili without any tiebreaks before being upset by 11th seed Pia Cramling in the second set of rapid tiebreaks. The tournament was ultimately won by her sister Mariya, whom she stayed to support. Early in 2016, Muzychuk won the women&#x27;s first prize at the Gibraltar Chess Festival with a score of 7/10, corresponding to a performance rating of 2677. During the tournament, she defeated two Grandmasters rated above 2600, Salem Saleh and Laurent Fressinet, the latter of whom was rated 2700 and is the only player she has defeated in a rated classical game with a rating of at least 2700. At the end of 2016, Muzychuk won both the Women&#x27;s World Rapid Championship and the Women&#x27;s World Blitz Championship in Doha, thereby also defending the latter of these two titles from 2014. She became the third player to win both events in the same year after Susan Polgar in 1992 and Magnus Carlsen in 2014. She won the rapid event by a full point over Aleksandra Kosteniuk and the blitz event by a ½ point ahead of Gunina and Kateryna Lagno.

===2017–2018: World Championship runner-up===
Muzychuk came closest to winning the classical Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship in 2017 in Tehran, where she finished runner-up to Tan Zhongyi. As the 2nd seed, she reached the final without needing tiebreaks, notably defeating 34th seed Alina Kashlinskaya, 7th seed Antoaneta Stefanova, and 3rd seed Alexandra Kosteniuk. Unlike the other matches which were best-of-two classical games, the final match against the 9th seed Tan was played as a best-of-four classical games. After Muzychuk lost the second game with the black pieces, she won the third game with the white pieces, sending the match to tiebreaks as the other two games ended in draws. Tan won the second game of the rapid tiebreaks to clinch the title.

At the end of 2017, Muzychuk gained widespread media attention for her decision to boycott the World Rapid and Blitz Championships in Saudi Arabia and forgo the opportunity to defend both of her World Championship titles because of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s restrictions against women, including those related to women&#x27;s clothing and the prohibition on women going outside without being accompanied by a man. She refused to attend despite the tournament having a prize fund five times higher than the previous edition. She commented:

Her announcement of the preceding comments on Facebook was shared over 74,000 times and received over 165,000 reactions predominantly in support of her statement. Her decision was also influenced by her feelings about having already competed at the Women&#x27;s World Championship in Iran earlier in the year where there were similar restrictions on clothing requiring women to wear headscarves. Having had that experience, she did not want to participate in the tournament in Saudi Arabia because she viewed her participation as supporting a society that has discriminating policies against women. The following year in 2018, Saudi Arabia was scheduled to host the tournament again; however, it was moved to Russia less than a month in advance largely due to a separate issue of Israeli players being denied visas needed to compete. Muzychuk returned to the tournament and fared better in the rapid event than the blitz event, finishing in fourth place.

For the second consecutive Women&#x27;s World Championship knockout tournament, Muzychuk faced Stefanova and Kosteniuk in back-to-back rounds, this time as the 4th seed in 2018. Although she once again defeated the 13th seed Stefanova, she then lost to the 5th seed Kosteniuk in the quarterfinals in rapid tiebreaks.

===2019–present: Two Candidates tournaments===
After the 2018 World Championship, the Women&#x27;s World Championship switched to a match format where the reigning champion would defend their title against the winner of an eight-player double round-robin Candidates tournament, the first of which would take place in 2019. Muzychuk was one of the players who qualified for the Candidates tournament by rating. Although she had a strong finish, she could not overcome a slow start where she lost two of the first three games to Dzagnidze and Tan, and her final score of 8/14 only sufficed for second place. At the end of 2019, Muzychuk won a third medal at the World Blitz Championship, earning the silver medal a ½ point behind only Lagno.

Muzychuk began 2020 at the Gibraltar Chess Festival. Although she did not win the women&#x27;s prize, she was awarded the overall tournament brilliancy prize for her last-round game against Ori Kobo, an Israeli Grandmaster. At the 2019–21 FIDE Women&#x27;s Grand Prix, the format was changed to have the top three players qualify for the next Candidates tournament in 2022 instead of just one player qualifying for a world championship match. Nonetheless, Muzychuk did not win any of the events and was unable to secure one of these spots. She was still able to qualify for the Candidates tournament by reaching the semifinals of the inaugural Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2021, a tournament that replaced the World Championship knockout events. As the 4th seed, she defeated 20th seed Elisabeth Pähtz and 5th seed Dzagnidze among others before losing to 1st seed Aleksandra Goryachkina in the penultimate round. Although she also lost the third place match to 7th seed Tan, she still earned one of three Candidates spots awarded through the World Cup by virtue of Goryachkina having already qualified as the previous World Championship runner-up. Muzychuk ended the year at the World Rapid and Blitz Championships. She finished in the top 15 at both events but was not in contention to medal by the later rounds.

==Team competitions==
===Slovenia===
Muzychuk represented Slovenia on the top board at five consecutive Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiads from 2004 to 2012. Slovenia&#x27;s best result came at the 2006 Turin Olympiad, where they finished in 9th place, outperforming their seed of 17th out of 106 teams. The team scored 16 points (+7–4=2), and Muzychuk individually scored 8/11, earning a double IM norm. Ana Srebrnič and Jana Krivec were on the second and third boards respectively, while Ksenija Novak was on the reserve board. Muzychuk&#x27;s best individual result came at the 2010 Khanty-Mansiysk Olympiad, where she scored 8/11 and finished in fifth place on the top board with a performance rating of 2547, 26 points below bronze medallist Hou Yifan&#x27;s performance rating of 2573.

Muzychuk fared better for Slovenia at the European Women&#x27;s Team Championships, which she took part in for four consecutive editions from 2005 through 2011. Slovenia finished in the top ten three times in those four tournaments, including in 2007 in Heraklion when they came in 6th place out of 30 teams and outperformed their 11th seed. Overall, the team scored 12 points (+5–2=2). Krivec, Srebrnič, and Vesna Rožič were on the lower boards that year, while Indira Bajt was on the reserve board. Muzychuk&#x27;s best result was in 2011 in Porto Carras when she earned an individual gold medal with a near-perfect score of 8½/9, corresponding to a performance rating of 2782, 150 points ahead of Lagno who won the silver medal. This performance also earned Muzychuk her final GM norm to clinch the Grandmaster title.

===Ukraine===

Since switching federations back to Ukraine, Muzychuk has played at three Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiads and her team has medalled at all of them. At the 2014 Tromsø Olympiad, she played on the top board in front of her sister Mariya, Natalia Zhukova, and Anna Ushenina on the lower boards, as well Inna Gaponenko on the reserve board. As a team, they were the 3rd seed and won the bronze medal with 18 points (+8–1=2), behind Russia who had 20 points and China who also had 18 points. They were the only team to defeat Russia, but lost to the lower-rated team of Serbia. With the same players, Ukraine again won bronze at the 2016 Baku Olympiad. As the 2nd seed, they finished with 17 points (+7–1=3), behind China who again had 20 points and Poland who also had 17 points. Their only loss was to the winners China. Individually, Muzychuk won the gold medal on the top board with an unbeaten 7½/10 and a performance rating of 2629, ahead of Hou Yifan. At the 2018 Batumi Olympiad, Ukraine were again the 2nd seed, using the same team except for swapping in Iulija Osmak on the reserve board. They tied with China for first place with an unbeaten 18 points (+7–0=4), but ended up with the silver medal because of the tiebreak criteria. Muzychuk narrowly did not earn an individual medal, finishing in fourth place on the top board.

Muzychuk has represented Ukraine at two European Women&#x27;s Team Championships, and her team has medalled at both of them. She played on the second board in 2015 in Reykjavik as Ukraine won the silver medal with a score of 15 points (+7–1=1). They drew the winners Russia and lost to bronze medallists Georgia. Muzychuk again played on the top board in 2017 in Hersonissos. Ukraine scored 13 points (+6–2=1) and won the bronze medal behind Russia and Georgia, the two teams who defeated them. Muzychuk won an individual silver medal with an unbeaten score of 6½/9 and a performance rating of 2621, behind only Alexandra Kosteniuk.

===European Club Cup===
Muzychuk has participated in the European Women&#x27;s Chess Club Cup since 2006. She started out playing for AVS Krasnoturinsk, winning team bronze and silver medals in her two appearances as well as an individual silver in her first appearance. She switched to ŠK T-Com Podgorica in 2008 and then Ekonomist SGSEU Saratov, winning a team bronze and individual silver for the former club. From 2010 until 2018, Muzychuk played for perennial contenders CE de Monte Carlo, winning five team gold medals and four individual gold medals on her respective boards. Her teammates on CE de Monte Carlo regularly included Hou Yifan, Koneru Humpy, and Pia Cramling. In 2019, Muzychuk switched clubs to the Kyiv Chess Federation. She won both team and individual silver medals in 2019 and then both team and individual bronze medals in 2021.

==Playing style==

Muzychuk has a very strong preference for 1.e4 (the King&#x27;s Pawn Game) with the white pieces. Although rarely used, her second-most frequent first move with the white pieces is 1.f4 (Bird&#x27;s Opening). She commonly defends against 1.e4 with the Sicilian defence (1.e4 c5) and commonly defends against 1.d4 with the Dutch defence (1.d4 f5). Muzychuk has described her playing style as similar to that of Fabiano Caruana in that they both focus on preparing openings and are good at positional chess. She considers herself an active player.

==Personal life==
Muzychuk and former world champion Viswanathan Anand co-hosted the official commentary for the 2021 World Chess Championship match between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi. Muzychuk was replacing Almira Skripchenko, who was unable to attend.

Muzychuk has a good friendly relationship with her sister, even though they regard each other as having very different personalities. Anna thinks of herself as calmer and prefers spending time with family and solitary activities such as reading or watching movies, in contrast with Mariya who is more expressive and likes shopping and doing things outside of home. All of their classical games against each other have ended in draws, while Anna has the only two wins between them in blitz format.

== Awards and honors ==
* Order of Princess Olga (3rd class) 

==Notable games==
* Anna Muzychuk (2539) – Ori Kobo (2445), 2020 Gibraltar Masters: Round 10; Sicilian defense, . Muzychuk was awarded the tournament brilliancy prize for her last-round game where she offered to sacrifice one of her bishops and her queen in the middle of the game. Tournament journalist John Saunders annotated the game below:
:: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 e6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Qc7 6.f4 a6 7.Nxc6 Qxc6 8.Bd3 b5 9.Qe2 Bb7 10.Bd2 Bc5 11.a3 Ne7 12.0‑0‑0 0‑0 13.h4 f5 14.g4 (&quot;&quot;14.h5 has been played before, but the text has the flavour of a devil-may-care last-round punt.&quot;) 14...d5 15.gxf5 exf5 16.exd5 Nxd5 17.Nxd5 Qxd5 18.Rhe1 Qf7 (&quot;18...Qa2 crossed my mind, threatening mate in one, but after simply 19.Bc3 the queen would be left looking silly.&quot;) 19.Bc3 Rfe8 20.Be5 Re6 21.Qf1 (&quot;21.Kb1!? followed by c4 looks like a good plan for White.&quot;) 21...Rf8 22.Qh3 Rh6?

Black had to do something about the monster bishop on e5 with 26...Bd6? though he&#x27;s still in dead trouble after 27.Qd3 Qxd3 28.cxd3 with an extra pawn, possibility of joint passed pawns if the bishops are exchanged, and h5 in the air.&quot;) 27.h5!!

<text>The Story of G.I. Joe, also credited in prints as &quot;Ernie Pyle&#x27;s Story of G.I. Joe&quot;, is a 1945 American war film directed by William A. Wellman and starring Burgess Meredith and Robert Mitchum. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Mitchum&#x27;s only career Oscar nomination.

The story is a tribute to the American infantryman (G.I. Joe) during World War II, told through the eyes of Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle, with dialogue and narration lifted from Pyle&#x27;s columns. The film concentrates on one company (C Company, 18th Infantry) that Pyle accompanies into combat in Tunisia and Italy.

In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically&quot; significant.

==Plot==
The untested infantrymen of C Company, 18th Infantry, U.S. Army, board trucks to travel to the front for the first time. Lt. Bill Walker allows war correspondent Ernie Pyle, himself a rookie to combat, to accompany them. Ernie follows the men all the way to the front lines through the rain and mud.

Ernie comes to know the men about whom he will write, including Sgt. Warnicki and privates Dondaro, Mew and Murphy.

Their baptism by fire occurs at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, a bloody chaotic defeat. Pyle is present at battalion headquarters when Walker arrives as a runner for his company commander. Ernie and the company part ways, but months later he seeks to find them, as he believes that they are the finest outfit in the army. He finds them on a road in Italy, about to attack a German-held town. Ernie finds that Company C has become proficient at killing without remorse. In house-to-house combat, they capture the town. After arrangements are made for Murphy to marry his nurse fiancée, a fatigued Ernie struggles to stay awake during the ceremony.

The company advances to a position in front of Monte Cassino, but, unable to advance, they are soon reduced to living in caves dug in the ground, persistent rain and mud, endless patrols and savage artillery barrages. When his men are forced to eat cold rations for Christmas dinner, Walker obtains food for them at gunpoint. Casualties are heavy, and young replacements are quickly killed before they can learn how to survive in combat. Walker is always short of lieutenants, and the veterans lose men, including Murphy. After a night patrol to capture a prisoner, Warnicki suffers a nervous breakdown and is sent to the infirmary. Ernie returns to the correspondents&#x27; quarters to write a piece on Murphy&#x27;s death and is told by his fellow reporters that he has won the Pulitzer Prize for his combat reporting. Ernie again connects with the outfit after Cassino is finally taken. His reunion with the men is interrupted when a string of mules is led to them, each carrying the dead body of a G.I. to be placed on the ground. A final mule, led by Dondaro, bears the body of Walker. The soldiers express their grief in the presence of Walker&#x27;s corpse.

Ernie joins the company as it proceeds down the road, narrating its conclusion: &quot;For those beneath the wooden crosses, there is nothing we can do, except perhaps to pause and murmur, &#x27;Thanks pal, thanks.&#x27;&quot;

===Casting notes===
Casting for the role of Pyle began in June 1944. Pyle had pleaded: &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t let them make me look like a fool.&quot; Producer Lester Cowan considered James Gleason and Walter Brennan for the lead role but selected Meredith because he was lesser known. Meredith had been serving as a captain in the Army, and the Army refused to release him from active duty. According to Meredith, the Army was overruled by presidential advisor Harry Hopkins, and his honorable discharge from the Army was approved personally by general George C. Marshall. Meredith spent time with Pyle, who was recuperating in New Mexico from the emotional effects of surviving an accidental bombing by the Army Air Forces at the start of Operation Cobra in Normandy. Pyle approved of the casting of Meredith and said that he believed Meredith to be the best choice after the death of British actor Leslie Howard in a plane crash. The studio had wanted to place a leading-man type in the main role, but Wellman wanted a physically smaller man such as Meredith to better portray the middle-aged Pyle. As a compromise, Mitchum was chosen to play Bill Walker. The film was one of Mitchum&#x27;s earliest starring roles.

Nine war correspondents are listed as technical advisors in the film&#x27;s credits, three of whom appear in the scene in which Pyle learns that he has won the Pulitzer Prize.

Wellman&#x27;s wife, actress Dorothy Coonan Wellman, appears in an uncredited speaking role as Lt. Elizabeth &quot;Red&quot; Murphy, the combat-zone bride of character &quot;Wingless&quot; Murphy.

The Army agreed to Wellman&#x27;s request for 150 soldiers, who were training in California for deployment to the Pacific and had all been veterans of the Italian campaign, as extras during the six weeks of filming in late 1944. The War Department allowed the men to grow beards for their roles. Wellman insisted that actual soldiers speak much of the dialogue for authenticity. He also insisted that the film&#x27;s Hollywood actors live and train with the soldiers.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
The film&#x27;s concept originated with independent producer Lester Cowan, who approached the War Department in September 1943 for cooperation in making a film about the infantry with the same high degree of prestige as in &quot;Air Force&quot;. In October, he agreed to terms with United Artists for financial support and distribution of the proposed film. Cowan then developed a story outline based on Pyle&#x27;s columns reproduced in &quot;Here is Your War,&quot; which the Army approved on November 27.

Attempts to write a script that would accurately translate Pyle&#x27;s style and sentiments to the screen delayed filming for a year After the D-Day Invasion of Normandy, with the end of the war in sight, the script became more focused on Pyle&#x27;s movements with the infantry in its final advance to victory.

The screenplay was developed with the input of several war correspondents and associates of Pyle, mainly Don Whitehead, Lee Miller and Paige Cavanaugh, who selected details from Pyle&#x27;s columns for inclusion in the film, Director William Wellman also worked directly with Pyle.

===Finding a director===
Cowan&#x27;s first choice as director was John Huston, who had completed only two films before entering military service. Cowan was impressed by two combat documentaries that Huston had directed, &quot;Report from the Aleutians&quot; and &quot;The Battle of San Pietro&quot;, but was unable to gain Huston&#x27;s services from the army.

In August 1944, unable to complete the screenplay, Cowan recruited William Wellman to be the film&#x27;s director but after facing great difficulty in convincing Wellman to take the job. Cowan asked Ernie Pyle to contact Wellman. Pyle invited Wellman to his home, where he persuaded Wellman to accept the director role.

===Historical basis===
Pyle covered the 1st Infantry Division, including the 18th Infantry, in Tunisia from January to May 1943, and wrote a column on the American defeat at Kasserine Pass. He also landed with the 1st Division during the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. However, after the Sicilian campaign, which is mentioned but not portrayed in the film, the 18th Infantry moved to England to prepare for the Allied invasion of France, while the film&#x27;s Company C is said to have made a landing under fire at Salerno.

While the screenwriters chose the 18th Infantry Regiment for the film, Pyle&#x27;s favorite outfit was the 133rd Infantry Regiment of the 34th Infantry Division, a unit that he had covered in 1942 while it was still stationed in Northern Ireland and then again in Tunisia.

The events in Italy portrayed in the film are based on Pyle&#x27;s experiences with soldiers of the 36th Infantry Division in the Battle of San Pietro and the 133rd Infantry in the Battle of Monte Cassino. Mitchum&#x27;s character of captain Bill Walker was modeled on two soldiers who had impressed Pyle. Walker was based on Captain Henry T. Waskow of the 36th Division&#x27;s Company B 143rd Infantry. Waskow&#x27;s death in combat on December 14, 1943, was the subject of Pyle&#x27;s most famous column. Sgt. &quot;Buck&quot; Eversole was a platoon leader who became the subject of several of Pyle&#x27;s stories.

== Release ==
Although filmed with Pyle&#x27;s cooperation, the film premiered two months to the day after he was killed in action on Ie Shima during the invasion of Okinawa. In his February 14, 1945 posting titled &quot;In the Movies&quot;, Pyle commented: &quot;They are still calling it &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot;. I never did like the title, but nobody could think of a better one, and I was too lazy to try.&quot;

==Critical appraisal==
Film critic Manny Farber in The New Republic, August 13, 1945, wrote:

Farber adds: “Wellman’s &quot;The Story of G. I. Joe&quot; is one of the only movies in years that says just about all it has to say, and drives it home with real cinematic strength.” 

Film critic and author &quot;James Agee&quot; lauded it in 1945: &quot;Coming as it does out of a world in which even the best work is nearly always compromised, and into a world which is generally assumed to dread honesty and courage and to despise artistic integrity, it is an act of heroism, and I cannot suggest my regard for it without using such words as veneration and love...It seems to me a tragic and eternal work of art...&quot; 

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; in 2000.

<doc id="1076792" wikidata="Q1760625" url="?curid=1076792" title="Pseudo-Isidore">
<text>Pseudo-Isidore is the conventional name for the unknown Carolingian-era author (or authors) behind an extensive corpus of influential forgeries. Pseudo-Isidore&#x27;s main object was to provide accused bishops with an array of legal protections amounting to de facto immunity from trial and conviction; to secure episcopal autonomy within the diocese; and to defend the integrity of church property. The forgeries accomplished this goal, in part, by aiming to expand the legal jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome.

==Historical background==
Pseudo-Isidore worked in the second quarter of the ninth-century, in the archiepiscopal province of Reims. A likely candidate is an ordination of Ebbo, then archbishop of Rheims. His sympathies lay with the rank-and-file Frankish episcopate. Decades of royally sponsored church reform had contributed substantially to the prominence and political importance of Frankish bishops; it also contributed to their legal vulnerability, as the reign of Louis I the Pious saw a series of sensational episcopal trials and depositions. Pseudo-Isidore was also heir to a long tradition of Carolingian church reform, and his forgeries also include a wide array of themes reflecting Frankish liturgical, doctrinal, educational and administrative aspirations.

==Content==
A major constituent of Pseudo-Isidore&#x27;s output consists of a collection of forged capitulary legislation ascribed to Charlemagne and Louis the Pious. These False Capitularies, which consist mostly of excerpts from genuine biblical, patristic and legal sources, are false primarily in the sense that almost none of them were ever promulgated by the Frankish kings. Among the many genuine items are also select forged capitula that advance the Pseudo-Isidorian program. In a preface, the pseudonymous compiler, Benedictus Levita (Benedict the Deacon) claims that he found these neglected capitularies in the archives of the cathedral at Mainz; and that the former Archbishop Otgar of Mainz ordered him to collect this material for posterity. Because Benedict seems to acknowledge that Otgar is dead at the time of his writing, it has been possible to date his preface to the years after 847.

Pseudo-Isidore also developed a small series of more minor forgeries which we find as appendices in manuscripts of the False Decretals. These include the Capitula Angilramni, a brief collection on criminal procedure allegedly given to Bishop Angilram of Metz by Pope Hadrian I; and a series of excerpts from the Rusticus version of the Council of Chalcedon.

==Authorship==
The names assumed by Pseudo-Isidore include Isidorus Mercator (conflated from the names of Isidore of Seville and Marius Mercator). Klaus Zechiel-Eckes claims that Pseudo-Isidore did important research at the library of the monastery of Corbie, in the Reims suffragan diocese of Amiens.

Zechiel-Eckes believed that the prominent theologian and abbot of Corbie, Paschasius Radbertus (abbot 842–847) was to be identified with Pseudo-Isidore; and that the earliest phase of work on the forgeries, amounting to a subset of the False Decretals, was completed in the later 830s. These theories once commanded wide support, but today they are increasingly disputed. Eric Knibbs has argued that older, traditional dating schemes, which placed the False Decretals in the 840s or early 850s, were essentially correct. Several decretal forgeries contain material that aims to justify Ebo in his episcopal translation to the bishopric at Hildesheim after 845. It has also emerged that the decretal forgeries incorporate many items from a mid-ninth-century Corbie manuscript of the works of Ennodius of Pavia, which would seem to preclude any dates for the decretal forgeries substantially before the 840s.

==Manuscripts==
Well over a hundred medieval manuscripts containing Pseudo-Isidorian material survive. The vast majority—around 100—carry copies of the False Decretals.

==Influence==
The final proof of forgery was provided by Calvinist preacher David Blondel, who discovered that the popes from the early centuries quoted extensively from much-later authors and published his findings (&quot;Pseudoisidorus et Turrianus vapulantes&quot;) in 1628.

<doc id="1076794" wikidata="Q199897" url="?curid=1076794" title="Medical Subject Headings">
<text>Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences. It serves as a thesaurus of index terms that facilitates searching. Created and updated by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), it is used by the MEDLINE/PubMed article database and by NLM&#x27;s catalog of book holdings. MeSH is also used by ClinicalTrials.gov registry to classify which diseases are studied by trials registered in ClinicalTrials.

MeSH was introduced in the 1960s, with the NLM&#x27;s own index catalogue and the subject headings of the Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus (1940 edition) as precursors. The yearly printed version of MeSH was discontinued in 2007; MeSH is now available only online. It can be browsed and downloaded free of charge through PubMed. Originally in English, MeSH has been translated into numerous other languages and allows retrieval of documents from different origins.

==Structure==

MeSH vocabulary is divided into four types of terms. The main ones are the &quot;headings&quot; (also known as MeSH headings or &quot;descriptors&quot;), which describe the subject of each article (e.g., &quot;Body Weight&quot;, &quot;Brain Edema&quot; or &quot;Critical Care Nursing&quot;). Most of these are accompanied by a short description or definition, links to related descriptors, and a list of synonyms or very similar terms (known as &quot;entry terms&quot;). MeSH contains approximately 30,000 entries () and is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology. MeSH terms are arranged in alphabetic order and in a hierarchical structure by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. When we search for a MeSH term, the most specific MeSH terms are automatically included in the search. This is known as the &quot;extended search&quot; or &quot;explode&quot; of that MeSH term. This additional information and the hierarchical structure (see below) make the MeSH essentially a thesaurus, rather than a plain subject headings list.

The second type of term, MeSH &quot;subheadings&quot; or &quot;qualifiers&quot; (see below), can be used with MeSH terms to more completely describe a particular aspect of a subject, such as adverse, diagnostic or genetic effects. For example, the drug therapy of asthma is displayed as asthma/drug therapy.

The remaining two types of term are those that describe the type of material that the article represents (&quot;publication types&quot;), and &quot;supplementary concept records&quot; (SCR) which describes substances such as chemical products and drugs that are not included in the headings (see below as &quot;Supplements&quot;).

===Descriptor hierarchy===
The &quot;descriptors&quot; or &quot;subject headings&quot; are arranged in a hierarchy. A given descriptor may appear at several locations in the hierarchical tree. The tree locations carry systematic labels known as &quot;tree numbers&quot;, and consequently one descriptor can carry several tree numbers. For example, the descriptor &quot;Digestive System Neoplasms&quot; has the tree numbers C06.301 and C04.588.274; C stands for Diseases, C06 for Digestive System Diseases and C06.301 for Digestive System Neoplasms; C04 for Neoplasms, C04.588 for Neoplasms By Site, and C04.588.274 also for Digestive System Neoplasms. The tree numbers of a given descriptor are subject to change as MeSH is updated. Every descriptor also carries a unique alphanumerical ID that will not change.

===Descriptions===
Most subject headings come with a short description or definition. See the MeSH description for diabetes type 2 as an example. The explanatory text is written by the MeSH team based on their standard sources if not otherwise stated. References are mostly encyclopaedias and standard textbooks of the subject areas. References for specific statements in the descriptions are not given; instead, readers are referred to the bibliography.

===Qualifiers===
In addition to the descriptor hierarchy, MeSH contains a small number of standard &quot;qualifiers&quot; (also known as &quot;subheadings&quot;), which can be added to descriptors to narrow down the topic. For example, &quot;Measles&quot; is a descriptor and &quot;epidemiology&quot; is a qualifier; &quot;Measles/epidemiology&quot; describes the subheading of epidemiological articles about Measles. The &quot;epidemiology&quot; qualifier can be added to all other disease descriptors. Not all descriptor/qualifier combinations are allowed since some of them may be meaningless. In all there are 83 different qualifiers.

===Supplements===
In addition to the descriptors, MeSH also contains some 318,000 &quot;supplementary concept records&quot;. These do not belong to the controlled vocabulary as such; instead they enlarge the thesaurus and contain links to the closest fitting descriptor to be used in a MEDLINE search. Many of these records describe chemical substances.

==Use in Medline/PubMed==
In MEDLINE/PubMed, every journal article is indexed with about 10–15 subject headings, subheadings and supplementary concept records, with some of them designated as &quot;major&quot; and marked with an asterisk, indicating the article&#x27;s major topics. When performing a MEDLINE search via PubMed, entry terms are automatically translated into (i.e., mapped to) the corresponding descriptors with a good degree of reliability; it is recommended to check the &#x27;Details tab&#x27; in PubMed to see how a search formulation was translated. By default, a search for a descriptor will include all the descriptors in the hierarchy below the given one. PubMed does not apply automatic mapping of the term in the following circumstances: by writing the quoted phrase (e.g. &quot;kidney allograft&quot;), when truncated on the asterisk (e.g. ), and when looking with field labels (e.g. ).

==Use at ClinicalTrials.gov==
At ClinicalTrials.gov, each trial has keywords that describe the trial. The ClinicalTrials.gov team assigns each trial two sets of MeSH terms. One set is for the conditions studied by the trial and the other for the set of interventions used in the trial. The XML file that can be downloaded for each trial contains these MeSH keywords. The XML file also has a comment that says: &quot;the assignment of MeSH keywords is done by imperfect algorithm&quot;.

==Categories==

The top-level categories in the MeSH descriptor hierarchy are:
* Anatomy [A]
* Organisms [B]
* Diseases [C]
* Chemicals and Drugs [D]
* Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]
* Psychiatry and Psychology [F]
* Phenomena and Processes [G]
* Disciplines and Occupations [H]
* Anthropology, Education, Sociology and Social Phenomena [I]
* Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]
* Humanities [K]
* Information Science [L]
* Named Groups [M]
* Health Care [N]
* Publication Characteristics [V]
* Geographicals [Z]

Shaped as an old white-clothed hitchhiking woman, a ghost (though not initially recognized as such) appears out of nowhere in front of the drivers and sometimes even speaks to them.

The first known Belchen ghost was actually male. The first written reports of the phenomenon, dated June 1980, involve a male hitchhiker who was picked up but eventually vanished from the vehicle, despite the driver&#x27;s high speed.

Towards the end of 1980, the &quot;white woman&quot; began appearing in or near the tunnel. On January 6, 1981, the tabloid &quot;Blick&quot; wrote about the sightings, followed by other media also adopting the story. Basel Police received many phone calls, dozens of which had to be logged.

The &quot;Bölchengespenst&quot;, or &quot;Bölchen ghost&quot;, became a popular subject for 1981&#x27;s Shrove Tuesday carnival. Even the musicians of the &quot;Oberbaselbieter Ländlerkapelle&quot; discussed the legend. Reports of the ghost then dwindled, until the 1983 edition of the book &quot;Baselbieter Sagen&quot; reported further sightings of the white woman. Two female jurists picked up an inconspicuously dressed, clumsy, pale, middle-aged woman in Eptingen. When they later asked her if she was feeling better, she answered:

When they looked at the back seat, the woman had disappeared.

===Other variations===
Such visitations don&#x27;t only happen inside or around tunnels. A re-edited edition of the &quot;Baselbieter Sagen&quot; mentions similar cases at other Basel places: &quot;the Heidegg castle&#x27;s lady,&quot; &quot;the maiden on the goat,&quot; and &quot;the grey woman in Zunzgen.&quot; In Läufelfingen, the woman wears a green loden coat. In the Canton of Bern, a girl in a short leather jacket appears. In the area of Basel, as with the case in Tenniken, a man wearing black is seen. The man prophesizes an earthquake and a hard winter before disappearing. The mysterious hitchhikers can even disappear if the car has only front doors and no back doors.

A 1981 article in the magazine &quot;Schweizer Volkskunde&quot; describes analogous visitations. According to it, such &quot;modern ghosts of the road&quot; were seen in other Swiss Cantons and tunnels, such as the Luzernerland area and in Toggenburg.

<doc id="1076814" wikidata="Q1148281" url="?curid=1076814" title="José María Bocanegra">
<text>José María de los Dolores Francisco Germán del Espíritu Santo Bocanegra y Villalpando (; 25 May 1787 – 23 July 1862) was a Mexican lawyer and statesman who was briefly interim president of Mexico in December 1829 during a coup attempt against president Vicente Guerrero. He previously served in various government positions, including President of the Chamber of Deputies and as a member of the Chamber of Deputies for Zacatecas.

He was appointed interim president by congress while President Guerrero personally led his troops against the insurrection. Five days later the rebels stormed the National Palace and overthrew Bocanegra, upon which they set up an executive triumvirate led by Pedro Velez.

==Biography==
Bocanegra graduated from the Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City, becoming a lawyer. During the colonial period he was a lawyer for the &quot;Audiencia&quot; and a member of the College of Attorneys. He was vice-president of the Committee of Charity of the Hospice for the Poor. During the First Mexican Empire he supported Agustín de Iturbide&#x27;s election to the throne, but opposed his later exercise of arbitrary power. He became a deputy to the first Mexican Constituent Congress in 1824. 

Bocanegra entered the Chamber of Deputies in 1827, and on 26 January 1829, President Guadalupe Victoria named him Minister of Internal and External Relations. He continued to hold this position with the change of administration to Vicente Guerrero, until 1 April 1829.

On 4 December 1829, Vice-President Anastasio Bustamante rose in revolt against Guerrero (Plan de Jalapa). Guerrero received permission from Congress to take the field to combat the rebels. On 16 December 1829, Bocanegra was appointed interim president by Congress during Guerrero&#x27;s absence by virtue of his position as president of the Supreme Court. He took office on December 18 and served until 23 December 1829, for only six days. On the latter date, the military garrison of Mexico City joined the Plan de Jalapa and withdrew recognition of Bocanegra. They installed an executive triumvirate of Pedro Vélez, Lucas Alamán and Luis de Quintanar. Bocanegra returned to his professional duties as a lawyer.

Later, Bocanegra was Minister of the Treasury under Presidents Valentín Gómez Farías and Antonio López de Santa Anna (26 April 1833 to 12 December 1833) and Minister of External Relations and of the Treasury under presidents Santa Anna, Nicolás Bravo and Valentín Canalizo (through 18 August 1844).

Bocanegra was known as an honorable and capable man who was uncomfortable participating in politics but felt it to be his duty to do so. He wrote the &quot;Memorias para la Historia de México Independiente&quot;. His nephew Francisco González Bocanegra was the author of the Himno Nacional Mexicano (the Mexican National Anthem). José María Bocanegra died on 23 July 1862 in the Federal District.

<text>The Kerenzerberg Tunnel is a motorway tunnel in Switzerland, and forms part of the A3 motorway from Basel and Zürich to Sargans. The tunnel is long and lies south-west of Lake Walen, under the Kerenzerberg Pass.

The Kerenzerberg Tunnel is a one-way, unidirectional tunnel. Traffic from Zürich to Sargans must pass through the tunnel, whilst traffic in the opposite direction runs along the shores of the Walensee through six short tunnels originally built for a railway. The railway now runs through the long Kerenzerberg Rail Tunnel, which is roughly parallel to the road tunnel.

Transportation of dangerous goods through the Kerenzerberg tunnel is prohibited.

<text>The British County Divisions of the Second World War were raised by the British Army in 1941 as a defence against a planned German invasion of Britain. They were static formations which were supposed to command the Independent Infantry Brigades (Home) which were on anti-invasion duties. Each coast in danger had its own County Division.

* Devon and Cornwall County Division
* Dorset County Division
* Durham and North Riding County Division
* Essex County Division (formerly the West Sussex County Division)
* Hampshire County Division
* Lincolnshire County Division
* Norfolk County Division
* Northumberland County Division
* West Sussex County Division (later, the Essex County Division)
* Yorkshire County Division

These formations had none of the usual divisional units that other permanent divisions had. Any they commanded were temporarily on loan from other formations.</text><links>

<text>The Seelisberg Tunnel is a motorway tunnel in Switzerland. The tunnel links Beckenried, in the canton of Nidwalden, with Seedorf, in the canton of Uri, running under the mountains that form the south shore of Lake Lucerne. It forms part of the A2 motorway between Basel, on the border with Germany and France, and Chiasso, on the border with Italy. Completed in 1980, the twin bores of the tunnel are and in length.

After the Gotthard Road Tunnel, this is Switzerland&#x27;s second-longest road tunnel but unlike the Gotthard Tunnel which crosses the Alps completely north to south, the Seelisberg Tunnel is situated only in the northern side of Alps. The Seelisberg tunnel can be considered to be the longest Swiss twin tube Road tunnel with split traffic (Southbound in one bore, and Northbound in another one).

The accident rate in the Seelisberg tunnel is very low. Most fatal accidents happened during bidirectional traffic, when the other tube was closed.

<doc id="1076830" wikidata="Q516751" url="?curid=1076830" title="Polyketide">
<text>In organic chemistry, polyketides are a class of natural products derived from a precursor molecule consisting of a chain of alternating ketone (, or its reduced forms) and methylene () groups: . First studied in the early 20th century, discovery, biosynthesis, and application of polyketides has evolved. It is a large and diverse group of secondary metabolites caused by its complex biosynthesis which resembles that of fatty acid synthesis. Because of this diversity, polyketides can have various medicinal, agricultural, and industrial applications. Many polyketides are medicinal or exhibit acute toxicity. Biotechnology has enabled discovery of more naturally-occurring polyketides and evolution of new polyketides with novel or improved bioactivity.

== History ==
Naturally produced polyketides by various plants and organisms have been used by humans since before studies on them began in the 19th and 20th century. In 1893, J. Norman Collie synthesized detectable amounts of orcinol by heating dehydracetic acid with barium hydroxide causing the pyrone ring to open into a triketide. Further studies in 1903 by Collie on the triketone polyketide intermediate noted the condensation occurring amongst compounds with multiple keten groups coining the term polyketides.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1955 that the biosynthesis of polyketides were understood. Arthur Birch used radioisotope labeling of carbon in acetate to trace the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid in &quot;Penicillium patulum&quot; and demonstrate the head-to-tail linkage of acetic acids to form the polyketide. In the 1980s and 1990s, advancements in genetics allowed for isolation of the genes associated to polyketides to understand the biosynthesis.

== Discovery ==
Polyketides can be produced in bacteria, fungi, plants, and certain marine organisms. Earlier discovery of naturally occurring polyketides involved the isolation of the compounds being produced by the specific organism using organic chemistry purification methods based on bioactivity screens. Later technology allowed for the isolation of the genes and heterologous expression of the genes to understand the biosynthesis. In addition, further advancements in biotechnology have allowed for the use of metagenomics and genome mining to find new polyketides using similar enzymes to known polyketides.

== Biosynthesis ==
Polyketides are synthesized by multienzyme polypeptides that resemble eukaryotic fatty acid synthase but are often much larger. They include acyl-carrier domains plus an assortment of enzymatic units that can function in an iterative fashion, repeating the same elongation/modification steps (as in fatty acid synthesis), or in a sequential fashion so as to generate more heterogeneous types of polyketides.
=== Polyketide synthase ===
Polyketides are produced by polyketide synthases (PKSs). The core biosynthesis involves stepwise condensation of a starter unit (typically acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA) with an extender unit (either malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA). The condensation reaction is accompanied by the decarboxylation of the extender unit, yielding a beta-keto functional group and releasing a carbon dioxide. The first condensation yields an acetoacetyl group, a diketide. Subsequent condensations yield triketides, tetraketide, etc. Other starter units attached to a coezyme A include isobutyrate, cyclohexanecarboxylate, malonate, and benzoate.

PKSs are multi-domain enzymes or enzyme complex consisting of various domains. The polyketide chains produced by a minimal polyketide synthase (consisting of a acyltransferase and ketosynthase for the stepwise condensation of the starter unit and extender units) are almost invariably modified. Each polyketide synthases is unique to each polyketide chain because they contain different combinations of domains that reduce the carbonyl group to a hydroxyl (via a ketoreductase), an olefin (via a dehydratase), or a methylene (via an enoylreductase).

Termination of the polyketide scaffold biosynthesis can also vary. It is sometimes accompanied by a thioesterase that releases the polyketide via hydrating the thioester linkage (as in fatty acid synthesis) creating a linear polyketide scaffold. However, if water is not able to reach the active site, the hydrating reaction will not occur and an intramolecular reaction is more probable creating a macrocyclic polyketide. Another possibility is spontaneous hydrolysis without the aid of a thioesterase.

=== Post-tailoring enzymes ===
Further possible modifications to the polyketide scaffolds can be made. This can include glycosylation via a glucosyltransferase or oxidation via a monooxygenase. Similarly, cyclization and aromatization can be introduced via a cyclase, sometimes proceeded by the enol tautomers of the polyketide. These enzymes are not part of the domains of the polyketide synthase. Instead, they are found in gene clusters in the genome close to the polyketide synthase genes.

== Classification ==
Polyketides are a structurally diverse family. There are various subclasses of polyketides including: aromatics, macrolactones/macrolides, decalin ring containing, polyether, and polyenes.

Polyketide synthases are also broadly divided into three classes: Type I PKSs (multimodular megasynthases that are non-iterative, often producing macrolides, polyethers, and polyenes), Type II PKSs (dissociated enzymes with iterative action, often producing aromatics), and Type III PKSs (chalcone synthase-like, producing small aromatic molecules).

In addition to these subclasses, there also exist polyketides that are hybridized with nonribosomal peptides (Hybrid NRP-PK and PK-NRP). Since nonribosomal peptide assembly lines use carrier proteins similar to those use in polyketide synthases, convergence of the two systems evolved to form hybrids, resulting in polypeptides with nitrogen in the skeletal structure and complex function groups similar to those found in amino acids.

== Applications ==
Polyketide antibiotics, antifungals, cytostatics, anticholesteremic, antiparasitics, coccidiostats, animal growth promoters and natural insecticides are in commercial use.

=== Medicinal ===
There are more than 10,000 known polyketides, 1% of which are known to have potential for drug activity. Polyketides comprise 20% of the top-selling pharmaceuticals with combined worldwide revenues of over USD 18 billion per year.

=== Agricultural ===
Polyketides can be used for crop protection as pesticides.

==== Examples ====
* Pesticides

** avermectin
** polynactins
** tetramycin

=== Industrial ===
Polyketides can be used for industrial purposes, such as pigmentation and dietary flavonoids.

==== Examples ====
* Pigments
** azaphilones
** hydroxyanthraquinones

== Biotechnology ==
Protein engineering has opened avenues for creating polyketides not found in nature. For example, the modular nature of PKSs allows for domains to be replaced, added or deleted. Introducing diversity in assembly lines enables the discovery of new polyketides with increased bioactivity or new bioactivity.

Furthermore, the use of genome mining allows for discovery of new natural polyketides and their assembly lines.

<text>The Gubrist Tunnel is a motorway tunnel in Switzerland. The tunnel lies to the north-west of the city of Zürich, and forms part of the A1 motorway, on its northern ring section around Zürich. The tunnel was completed in 1985, and is in length.

The tunnel is named after the hill of Gubrist, which is nearby. In 1990, 63,000 cars/day used this tunnel; in 2014 the number had risen to 106,000, but by 2025 this number is expected to rise to 125,000. By 2023, the tunnel reached 120,000 cars.

This is part of the &#x27;A1 Nordumfahrung&#x27; renovation plan covering the western entrance, the Gubrist Tunnel itself, and a further 10 km of motorway west of the tunnel. The project will expand the motorway approaching the tunnel from its original 4 lanes (2 in each direction) to 6 lanes (3 in each direction). The major junctions immediately east (the Weiningen junction) and west (the Affoltern junction) of the tunnel will also be modernised. The project will cost in total 1.55 billion Swiss francs. Work started in 2014 and was scheduled to take 9 years. In July 2023, the third tube was inaugurated. Construction was hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides the village Weiningen nearby fiercely opposed the plans and appealed to the Federal Court achieved for the tunnel to include a covering fence of 100m at the end against noise and smell. 

In 2012, the Gubrist Tunnel was rated as &#x27;sufficient&#x27; () in a test of tunnel safety undertaken by the Touring Club Suisse and was the second worst tunnel in the test.

<doc id="1076845" wikidata="Q4336947" url="?curid=1076845" title="Orla coat of arms">
<text>Orla (derived from Polish &#x27;eagle&#x27;) is a distinct Polish armorial estate and heraldic clan coat of arms adopted in Polish heraldry since the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. It was vested upon several knightly families of Poland&#x27;s nobility in the historical regions of the Duchy of Greater Poland, the Duchies of Silesia, and the Lesser Poland Province from about the 14th century onwards. It was first historically known in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland as the coat of arms of &#x27;Saszor&#x27; (Szaszor), later derived as the &#x27;Orla&#x27; arms, and subsequently conferred on the ennoblement of several individuals.

==History==
Orla is one of the oldest Polish coats of arms. The coat of arms was naturalised into Polish heraldry during the Jagiellonian dynasty and is derived from its Roman-German origin, attributed to the personal coat of arms borne by the House of Saszowski and its branch scions. This coat of arms, known specifically as the Saszor arms, was held distinct to this family and its members.

Following its general designation as Orla, it was subsequently borne by several unrelated Polish knightly families and individuals connected by heraldic adoption at ennoblement. As frequently found with Polish coats of arms, it was borne by some supposed members misattributed to the heraldic clan by error or usurpation.

==Blazon==
Silver (Argent), an eagle displayed headless red (Gules), on the neck a star of six rays red (gules); N.B. the star, as well as the eagle claws, are often found represented (rightly or wrongly) as gold (Or) tincture in Polish heraldic literature.

==Notable member bearers==
From the classical Polish heraldic reference &quot;Herby rycerstwa polskiego&quot; (Armorials of Polish Knights) published in 1584 by Bartosz Paprocki, bearers are shown in order of precedence:
* House of Saszowski (historically equally written as Szaszowski, Schaschowsky, Saschowsky et al.), and its branch scions alias Palczowski and Gierałtowski.
** Jakub Saszowski of Gierałtowic (equally known as Gierałtowski), Burgrave of Kraków and Wawel Royal Castle
** (equally known as Palczowski), (b. 1530, d. 1587), Burgrave of Kraków and Wawel Royal Castle
** (b. about 1507, d. 1565)
** (b. about 1568, d. 1627)
** (b. about 1570, d. about 1609)
* House of Barski
* House of Chobienicki
&quot;and the individuals:&quot;
* Jorogniewski
* Kełbowski
* Ligocki

<text>Danny Chan Pak-Keung (; 7 September 1958 – 25 October 1993) was a Hong Kong singer, songwriter and actor. One of the first Cantopop idols in Hong Kong, he gained fame alongside performers Alan Tam, Anita Mui, and Leslie Cheung, who were collectively known as &quot;Three Kings and a Queen&quot; (三王一后) or &quot;Tam Cheung Mui Chan&quot; (譚張梅陳) in the 1980s. He is best remembered for such songs as &quot;Waiting&quot; (等), &quot;Life Expectation&quot; (一生何求), &quot;Ripples&quot; (漣漪), &quot;Loving You Alone&quot; (偏偏喜歡你) and &quot;Cherish Tonight&quot; (今宵多珍重).

==Early life and career==
Chan was born on 7 September 1958 at Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam (薄扶林). His father, Chan Pang-Fee (; 1923 – 5 April 2019), a businessman in the watch industry, was fond of Cantonese opera and became one of his son&#x27;s musical influences.

During his childhood, Chan developed a passion for music and mostly learnt to play organ keyboard and piano by himself. He was an alumnus of St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College and also a classmate of lyricist Andrew Lam Man Chung (林敏驄). 

Chan won third prize at the TVB &quot;Hong Kong Pop Song Writing Invitation&quot; in 1977 with his self-written English song &quot;The Rocky Road&quot;. In 1978, he won first prize at the Hong Kong Yamaha Electone Festival by playing the theme music of the movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. This earned him his singing contract with Hong Kong Television Broadcasts (TVB) and officially launched his entertainment career. In that same year, he made his acting debut with HK TVB through a TV drama called &quot;Sweet Babe&quot; (甜姐兒). 

Chan&#x27;s musical talent attracted the attention of artist manager Tam Kwok-Gei (譚國基). Tam signed Chan under his artist management agency, Hollywood Casting Agency (HCA), and subsequently had Chan sign a recording contract with EMI. Chan&#x27;s first music album, &quot;First Love&quot;, was released in 1979. His self-composed song on the album, &quot;Tears for You&quot; (眼淚為你流), was an instant hit. 
Chan subsequently signed music contracts with Hong Kong EMI (1979), WEA (1980), DMI (1986), and finally moved back to WEA (1989). His Cantopop romance ballads achieved high levels of public success and critical acclaim, some of which are still popular such as &quot;Waiting&quot; (等), &quot;Life Expectation&quot; (一生何求), &quot;Ripples&quot; (漣漪), &quot;Loving You Alone&quot; (偏偏喜歡你), &quot;Cherish Tonight&quot; (今宵多珍重), &quot;Deeply in Love with You&quot; (深愛著你), &quot;Having You&quot; (有了你), &quot;Misty Rain&quot; (煙雨悽迷), &quot;Applause&quot; (喝采), and &quot;Minutes&#x27; Date&quot; (幾分鐘的約會). The song &quot;Remembrance on Parents&#x27; Love&quot; (念親恩) is often played on radio stations and frequently chosen for karaoke. 

Chan&#x27;s first five albums were produced by Tam Kwok-Gei, and the song concepts were mostly targeted towards youth. Chan composed a large quantity of songs during this period. From the sixth album, &quot;Pouring Out My Heart&quot; (傾訴), onward, Chan started to produce albums himself. He reached his first peak in his musical career with this album and the next one, &quot;Loving You Alone&quot; (偏偏喜歡你), where the album sales achieved five platinum certifications (250,000 copies) in Hong Kong.

In 1984, he sang an English duet &quot;Tell Me What Can I Do&quot; with American country music singer Crystal Gayle. It was produced in the US and released in both the US and Japan, but was largely unknown due to lack of promotional budget. Meanwhile, he also covered Jim Capaldi&#x27;s ballad &quot;Warm&quot; with an improved music arrangement.

In the early 1980s, Chan was a host in the TV show &quot;Bang Bang Sound&quot; (Bang Bang咁嘅聲). His co-operation with Leslie Cheung and Paul Chung in the films &quot;Encore&quot; (1980) (喝采) and &quot;On Trial&quot; (1981) (失業生), received positive reception from the public and media. He is the main character in HK TVB TV series &quot;Breakthrough&quot; (1982) (突破) together with his favourite female partner Mary Jean Reimer (翁靜晶). His sole comedy film &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; (1984) (聖誕快樂) was a huge box office success. He is also one of the main characters in one of Hong Kong&#x27;s the most famous romantic film from the 1980s, &quot;An Autumn&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1987) (秋天的童話), as Vincent (Jennifer&#x27;s ex-boyfriend), with Chow Yun-fat (as Samuel Pang) and Cherie Chung (as Jennifer).
During the span of his musical career, Chan held many music concerts in Hong Kong, China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, Canada and the United States. He held his first major local concert at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in July 1982 (2 nights), and another concert in the newly developed Hong Kong Stadium in September 1983 (2 nights), both of which were organised by Brainchild Productions (富才制作). From this time on, all of his major concerts were held in Hong Kong Stadium. His avant-garde concept January 1985 concerts (3 nights) were organised by Capitol Artists Entertainment (華星娛樂), but was met with underwhelming feedback. Warm critical acclaims was received in the Dickson Entertainment (迪生娛樂) organised concerts in December 1986 (2 nights) and April 1988 (4 nights). His 10th anniversary concerts in September/October 1989 (6 nights), and the purple themed concerts in March 1991 (3 nights) were organised by Yiu Wing Entertainment (耀榮娛樂).

Chan also participated and represented Hong Kong in various music festivals, such as the World Popular Song Festival 1984 in Tokyo, the Nagasaki Asia Music Festival 1988 in Japan, Peace Music Concert 1988 in Singapore, Tokyo Music Festival 1989 and the Shanghai Music Festival Warner Music Special Concert 1991. He was also invited to perform at the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympic Games opening ceremony. In 1986, he performed in the presence of The Royal Thai princess in a Thai charity show.

In 1991, Chan announced his decision to leave the Hong Kong music industry. He had planned to hold several farewell concerts in the US, Canada and Hong Kong, but his sudden descent into a coma in May 1992 halted such plans.

==Death==
Chan suffered from mild depression, which worsened during the late 1980s. 

On 18 May 1992, Chan was found unconscious and he was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. Chan had suffered from advanced brain damage. It was speculated that this was due to drug use. He went into a coma for almost a year and a half and died on 25 October 1993 at the age of 35. He was buried at Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.

==Legacy==

On 26 October 1993, the day after Chan&#x27;s passing, Commercial Radio organized a 90-minute memorial concert at Queen Elizabeth Stadium. Those who attended the video concert included Kenny Bee, Elisa Chan, Liu Fong, Sam Tsang, Yu Sin-man, and members of the pop music group City Beat. Sounds of weeping were heard throughout the performance, with the venue at some moments falling completely silent. During the concert, Kenny Bee stated: &quot;We have lost one of our best musicians. It is a show for Danny; but, he could not turn up tonight... I hope he could still feel our love.&quot;

On 22 October 1995, Chan&#x27;s father, Chan Pang-Fee, sponsored and built the &quot;Danny Commemoration Pavilion&quot; (陳百強紀念館) in his ancestoral hometown Sijiu Town, Taishan City, Guangdong Province, China (中國廣東省台山市四九鎮). A favourite spot for his fans to visit and remember him.

On 8 November 2005, the Hong Kong Post issued a set of special stamps featuring &quot;Hong Kong Pop Singers&quot;. This stamp set focused on Hong Kong&#x27;s popular singers, saluting five pop stars who have left their mark on Cantopop music history. Chan was featured on the HK$1.80 stamp.

<text>Babasónicos is an Argentine rock band, formed in the early 1990s along with others such as Peligrosos Gorriones and Los Brujos. After emerging in the wave of Argentine New Rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Babasonicos became one of the banner groups of the &quot;sonic&quot; underground rock movement in Argentina in the late 1990s.

The band name refers partly to Sai Baba, the Indian guru, and partly to a local toy gun called &quot;La Pistola Sónica&quot;

The lead singer Adrián &quot;Dárgelos&quot; Rodríguez and the keyboardist Diego &quot;Uma-T&quot; Tuñón initially decided to create a new style, which would not follow the established Argentine music. The other official band members are: Diego &quot;Uma&quot; Rodríguez (guitarist and lead singer), Diego &quot;Panza&quot; Castellano (drummer), Mariano &quot;Roger&quot; Domínguez (guitarist), and Gabriel &quot;Gabo&quot; Manelli (bassist, deceased).

For their second album, &quot;Trance Zomba&quot; (1994), they incorporated a guest DJ, &quot;DJ Peggyn&quot; who would eventually remain as a band member until after releasing &quot;Miami&quot; (1999). This same year the band saw the departure of their longtime manager Cosme.

In 1999, they collaborated with Ian Brown on a song that bears their name on his album &quot;Golden Greats&quot;.

In 2001, the band released &quot;Jessico,&quot; their most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album up to that point, reaching a broad mainstream audience with singles like &quot;Los Calientes&quot;, &quot;El Loco&quot; and &quot;Deléctrico&quot;.

The following records, &quot;Infame&quot; (2003), &quot;Anoche&quot; (2005) and &quot;Mucho (2008) &quot;continued with a streak of critical praise and commercial success, each one being selected by several media outlets as one of the best Argentine albums of their respective years.

Babasonicos also composed the soundtrack for Vera Fogwill&#x27;s movie &quot;Las Mantenidas Sin Sueños&quot; (&quot;Kept and Dreamless&quot;), which was released in 2007. The album was composed in 2003.

On January 12, 2008, the band posted an entry on their official site in which they informed that their longtime bassist, Gabriel Manelli had died as a result of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, which he had been suffering since the tour supporting the album &quot;Infame&quot;. Multi-instrumentalist and long-time friend Carca joined the group in replace of Manelli in their 2011 album &quot;A Propósito&quot;. 

They released their latest album &quot;Trinchera&quot;, in 2022.

<doc id="1076882" wikidata="Q787800" url="?curid=1076882" title="Myōjō">
<text> was a monthly literary magazine published in Japan between April 1900 and November 1908. The name &quot;Myōjō&quot; can be translated as either Bright Star or Morning Star.

==History and profile==
The magazine was established in 1900. It was the organ of a poetry circle called &quot;Shinshisha&quot; (New Poetry Society) which had been founded by Yosano Tekkan in 1899. &quot;Myōjō&quot; was initially known for its development and promotion of a modernized version of the 31-syllable &quot;tanka&quot; poetry. Famous contributors such as Yosano Akiko, who also edited the magazine, transformed the traditional poetry with a sensual style in the romantic movement.

Other important contributors included Hagiwara Sakutaro, Ishikawa Takuboku, , Kitahara Hakushu, Noguchi Yonejiro, Kinoshita Rigen, and Haruo Satō. The magazine was advised by Mori Ōgai, Ueda Bin and Baba Kocho, with Yosano Tekkan remaining as editor-in-chief of the publication.

&quot;Myōjō&quot; gradually transformed itself from purely &quot;tanka&quot; poetry, to a sophisticated journal promoting the visual arts and western style poetry as well. It is regarded as having a crucial influence on the development of Japanese poetry and literature in the early 20th century.

&quot;Myōjō&quot; was short lived, as internal dissension dissolved the &quot;Shinshisha&quot; literary circle. Many of its original members helped create a successor literary journal, &quot;Subaru&quot; (&quot;The Pleiades&quot;). &quot;Myōjō&quot; was revived from 1921–1927 by Tekkan, and again from 1947–1949.

<doc id="1076885" wikidata="Q2198931" url="?curid=1076885" title="Powerstock">
<text>Powerstock is a village and civil parish in south west Dorset, England, situated in a steep valley on the edge of the Dorset Downs, north-east of the market town of Bridport. The civil parish includes the village of West Milton to the west and the summit and northern slopes of Eggardon Hill to the south-east. Powerstock village contains many cottages and two inns: &quot;The Three Horseshoes&quot; near the church and &quot;The Marquis of Lorne Inn&quot; on the other side of the valley in a small hamlet called Nettlecombe. The small Mangerton River runs through the valley. 

In 2013 the parish had an estimated population of 290. In the 2011 census figures have been published for Powerstock parish combined with the small parish of North Poorton to the north; the population in this area was 358.

Powerstock was rated as among the &quot;20 most beautiful villages in the UK and Ireland&quot; by Condé Nast Traveler in 2020.

==History==
The origins of the name Powerstock have not been fully determined; the second part derives from the Old English &quot;stoc&quot;, meaning an outlying farmstead, but the first part—similar to the nearby settlement of Poorton—is unresolved. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Povrestoch&quot;. 

Powerstock Castle is a medieval motte and bailey castle. St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church dates from the 12th century and is a Grade I listed building. 

According to one source, the name was &#x27;Poorstock&#x27; until the Bridport Railway was built through the village in 1857, when the change to Powerstock was made to avoid connotations of &#x27;poor (rolling) stock&#x27;. However another source states the name existed in its current form as early as 1787. Powerstock railway station (and the entire Bridport branch line) closed on 5 May 1975.

==Landscape==
Poorstock Forest was one of the 80 royal forests created by the Normans in the 11th, 12th and early 13th centuries, in part to support medieval hunting. The term &quot;forest&quot; originally referred to land where hunting and forestry rights were reserved for a monarch or the aristocracy.

The nearby Eggardon Hill (height ) lies about south-east of the village. On the summit is a 14-hectare Iron Age hill-fort, from which can be viewed a wide panorama of the Dorset countryside. Just over a mile to the east of the village lies the nature reserve of Powerstock Common.

Another prominent hill is Drackenorth, some north-northeast, which lies on the Jubilee Trail.
There is also a cricket pitch located at The Weir playing field in Nettlecombe. This has traditionally been used by Powerstock and Hooke Cricket Club. It has also been used to host Powerstock&#x27;s Village Fete.

==In popular culture==
Powerstock was used as the filming location for a BBC production of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;A Murder is Announced&quot; and the 2010 Springwatch series.

<text>Joseph Parry (21 May 1841 – 17 February 1903) was a Welsh composer and musician. Born in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, he is best known as the composer of &quot;Myfanwy&quot; and the hymn tune &quot;Aberystwyth&quot;. Parry was also the first Welshman to compose an opera; his composition, &quot;Blodwen&quot;, was the first opera in the Welsh language.

Born into a large family, Parry left school to work in the local coal mines when he was nine years of age. He then went to work at the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, where his father was also employed. In 1854 the family emigrated to the United States, settling at Danville, Pennsylvania, where Parry again found employment at an iron works.

Though Parry had a great interest in music, he had no opportunity to study it until there was a temporary closure of the Rough and Ready Iron Works. Some of his co-workers were also musicians, and they offered music lessons while the iron works was closed. Parry joined a music sight-reading class taught by one of the men. He continued to study harmony with another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.

Parry soon began submitting compositions to eisteddfodau in Wales and the United States and winning awards. During a return visit to Wales for the National Eisteddfod at Llandudno, Parry was offered two music scholarships, but was unable to accept due to family obligations. A fund was established for the support of Parry and his family while he studied music.

Parry went on to receive a doctorate in music from the University of Cambridge; he was the first Welshman to receive bachelor&#x27;s and doctor&#x27;s degrees in music from the University. He returned to Wales in 1874 to become the first professor of music at Aberystwyth University, later accepting a position at Cardiff University.

==Life==
===Early years===
Parry was born in Merthyr Tydfil in 1841, the seventh of eight children of Daniel (1800–1866) and Elizabeth Parry (née Richards, 1806–1886). The family was musically inclined, with all family members singing in the chapel choir. Parry&#x27;s mother, who performed at church functions, was remembered for her fine voice; two of Parry&#x27;s sisters, Elizabeth and Jane, and a brother, Henry, gained some prominence in the United States as vocalists. He left school at age nine to work in the mines as the family needed the income. Young Parry worked a 56-hour week for twelve and a half pence while at the mine. By age 12, Parry was working at the puddling furnaces of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, where his father also worked.

Parry&#x27;s father, Daniel, emigrated to the United States in 1853; the rest of the family followed in 1854. Like his father and brother, Parry became a worker at the Rough and Ready Iron Works in Danville, Pennsylvania. Danville had a large Welsh community and he became involved in strengthening Welsh culture locally, attending the Congregational Chapel and the Sunday school. Parry also served as the organist for the Mahoning Presbyterian Church in Danville; the organ he played is still in service. Although he had sung in church choirs in Wales and the United States, Parry received no formal music lessons until he was 17 and living in Danville.

Parry&#x27;s opportunity to study music came in the form of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.

===Return to Wales===

Parry competed in the eisteddfod at Utica in 1861, and took first prize for &quot;Temperance Vocal March&quot;. Curious as to how his music would be received in his native Wales, in 1864, he sent an anthem to the National Eisteddfod of Wales at Llandudno. The adjudicators awarded him first prize, believing he was a professional musician. In 1865, Parry again prepared an entry, but this time he travelled to the contest in Aberystwyth. Parry&#x27;s anthem entry was lost in the post, so it could not be judged. Instead, he was given a seat in the Gorsedd and the title &quot;Pencerdd America&quot; (&quot;Chief Musician of America&quot;).

During this visit, Parry and his friends who had accompanied him to Wales travelled the country giving concerts of Parry&#x27;s own works. They were well received throughout the land. Parry was offered the opportunity to study for a year under Dr Davies of Swansea, followed by a one-year scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. He had to refuse both offers since he had a wife and child in the United States dependent on him for support. By 1865, Parry&#x27;s musical ability had become well known in Wales and in the United States. A fund was established to support Parry and his family while he studied music; donations were received from both countries. Parry aided his own cause by giving concerts in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.

In August 1868 Parry and his family arrived in England, where he began a three-year study at the Royal Academy of Music under William Sterndale Bennett and Manuel Garcia. During his last year of study at the Royal Academy, Parry appeared before Queen Victoria three times, each time by her special request. The Queen made another request of Parry each time he appeared: that he perform only works he had composed. In 1871, Bennett convinced Parry to enter University of Cambridge for a degree in music. While at Cambridge, Parry became the first Welshman to take both the MusB and MusD there. After earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Parry and his family returned to Danville, where he operated a school of music for the next three years. When Aberystwyth University established a chair for music, it was offered to Parry; he moved his family back to Wales, becoming the university&#x27;s first professor of music.

===Professor and doctor of music===

Parry worked at Aberystwyth from 1874 to 1881. In addition to his university duties, Parry frequently travelled as an adjudicator and conducting concerts of his compositions. He received his doctorate from Cambridge in 1878. At the time a candidate was required to compose a short oratorio and to have the work publicly performed; the normal method was to have one of the college Chapel Choirs perform the oratorio. But Parry obtained the services of many Welsh singers; 100 made the trip to Cambridge to perform Parry&#x27;s oratorio. When Parry resigned his position at Aberystwyth University in 1880, he opened his own academy of music in the town.

In 1881, the Parry family left Aberystwyth for Swansea, where Parry became the organist at Ebenezer Chapel and was head of a musical college he founded. When he was offered a chair at Cardiff University in 1888, Parry and his family moved to the nearby town of Penarth. He lectured and taught at the university and was known as &quot;Y Doctor Mawr&quot; (&quot;The Great Doctor&quot;). Parry also accepted a position as the organist at Christ Church Congregational Church in Penarth.

Parry became a candidate for principal of the Guildhall School of Music in 1896; the vacancy was due to the death of Sir Joseph Barnby. Officials of the city of Cardiff, colleagues and students at Cardiff University, as well as Parry&#x27;s former teachers wrote letters to the School of Music Committee in support of his election to the position. There were 38 applicants for the position; the field was reduced to two candidates through a series of ballots by the Court of Common Council. Parry was no longer under consideration after the first round of reductions. He remained at the university and continued his work as an eisteddfod adjudicator, a conductor at Cymanfaoedd Canu, and as a performer and lecturer throughout Wales and the United States until the time of his death.

===Personal life and characteristics===

In 1861 in Danville, Pennsylvania Parry married Jane Thomas (1844–1918). She was the daughter of Welsh immigrants and the sister of Gomer Thomas, who published many of Parry&#x27;s early compositions. The couple had three sons and two daughters. The older children were born when the family was still living in Danville; only Parry&#x27;s youngest child was born in Wales. Two of Parry&#x27;s three sons died after the family moved to Penarth. Parry&#x27;s youngest son, William, died in 1892; his oldest son, Joseph Haydn, died two years later. While all of Parry&#x27;s children are said to have had musical talent, his eldest, Joseph Haydn, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a composer and teacher.

Later in 1894, Parry and his wife hoped a trip to the US would help ease some of the sadness over the deaths of their two sons. Parry had last visited the United States on a vocal concert tour in 1880. Though the Parrys would be visiting family, he believed he should be available to the public during the visit since many people in the US had helped him financially when he was studying music in England.

Parry asked an old friend to notify the Welsh community in the United States that he would be visiting and would adjudicate at eisteddfodau, lecture or lead cymanfaoedd canu if desired. The community could arrange for Parry to visit by contacting Rev. Thomas Edwards of Edwardsville, Pennsylvania. Parry and his family visited many cities and towns in the eastern US and were warmly received wherever they went. He kept those back in Cardiff advised of his travels through letters to the &quot;Western Mail&quot; which were printed by the newspaper. Parry&#x27;s last journey to the United States in 1898 included a visit to Salt Lake City, where he adjudicated at the third Salt Lake eisteddfod which was held in the Mormon Tabernacle. His last major work, an opera entitled &quot;The Maid of Cefn Ydfa&quot;, premiered at the Grand Theatre in Cardiff in late December 1902.

Parry was known as a religious man and a hard worker both at the iron works and at his craft. Despite his recognition in Wales and in the United States, he was not a wealthy man. Parry had little aptitude for business. With his permission, a committee of his friends managed his affairs, with Parry creating compositions and his friends tending to the business of publications. Since his compositions were based primarily on Welsh subjects, many of Parry&#x27;s friends believed it would have been to his advantage to have settled in London, where there were more cosmopolitan experiences to draw inspiration from. In 1859, Parry and his family became citizens of the United States; he was equally proud of being a Welshman and a United States citizen.

David Jenkins, who was a student and assistant to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic to be a good conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him as a man of great musical ability.

===Death===
About two weeks before his death, Parry became suddenly ill. The medical condition was serious enough to warrant surgery. An operation was performed and a full recovery was expected. Some days after the surgery, it was necessary to perform a second operation due to complications. Parry developed a high fever from blood poisoning a few days after the second surgery. There was a slight rally, but Parry continued to have relapses and grew steadily weaker. Parry, who had planned a tour of Australia and the US for 1904, lay in his sick bed when &quot;The Maid of Cefn Ydfa&quot; was signed for performances by three opera companies; he was never able to be told of the good news. Parry died at his Penarth home on 17 February 1903. His last composition was written during his final illness-a tribute to his wife, Jane, entitled &quot;Dear Wife&quot;.

At least 7,000 people from all parts of the country gathered in Penarth for the funeral of Joseph Parry. They lined the route from Parry&#x27;s home to Christ Church, where the family worshipped and to the churchyard at St Augustine&#x27;s. His family and friends were joined by officials from the city of Cardiff, faculty and students from Cardiff University, representatives from the National Eisteddfod and many members of various choirs throughout Wales. Ministers of various denominations were also part of those gathered to pay respects to Parry. He was buried on the north side of St Augustine&#x27;s Churchyard, Penarth. Parry&#x27;s monument is a marble column topped by a lyre with seven strings, with the strings representing the members of Parry&#x27;s family. Two of the seven strings of the lyre are broken to represent the deaths of his two sons, who died before Parry.

Shortly after his death, a national fund was established in Parry&#x27;s name. This was meant to provide support for his widow, Jane, through an annual annuity; any funds remaining after Jane&#x27;s death were to be used to provide a national music scholarship named for Parry.

==Music==

Parry was a prolific composer; one of his early works, &quot;My Childhood Dreams&quot;, was published while he was living in Danville. Despite his penchant for composing, most of his major works were not commercially successful. His oratorio, &quot;Saul of Tarsus&quot;, was commissioned for the National Eisteddfod at Rhyl in 1892, and was somewhat successful. Parry and others considered it to be his best work; the problem with the oratorio was that it was difficult to perform and that the score for the composition is 305 pages long.

Parry is believed to have composed 27 complete works, among them ten operas, five cantatas and two oratorios, as well as many songs and hymns. By the 1890s, Parry was sufficiently well known and was asked to produce many of his works on a commission basis. He dealt with a variety of publishers for some of his works, while he published others himself. Parry published his opera, &quot;Blodwen&quot;, himself but the reasons for this are not clear. He appears to have done less self-publishing in the 1890s. Part of the reason for this may have been the loss of his printing plates in the &quot;Western Mail&quot; fire of 1893.

During Parry&#x27;s lifetime, many of his works remained unpublished; the shelves of his study held stacks of manuscripts. A friend of Parry&#x27;s talked with him about the possibility of losing all of his manuscripts if there was a fire and suggested Parry needed a safe to store his manuscripts in. When Parry said he could not afford to buy a safe, the friend gave him one as a gift. Over 100 years after his death, one of his unknown works, &quot;Te Deum&quot;, was discovered by accident in the National Library of Wales archives.

After Parry&#x27;s death, the Welsh Congregational Church sought to purchase the copyrights of all Parry&#x27;s works and to publish them. The church was successful in obtaining the copyright to &quot;Aberystwyth&quot; and more than 60 other hymns and anthems written by Parry. In 1916, Parry&#x27;s widow, Jane, sold the rights to all works which Parry owned the copyrights of to Snell and Sons, music publishers, for £1150.

===&quot;Aberystwyth&quot;===
The music, written by Parry, was first published in 1879 by Stephen and Jones in &quot;Ail Lyfr Tonau ac Emynau&quot; (English tr. &quot;Second Book of Tunes and Hymns&quot;). It was paired with Charles Wesley&#x27;s words, &quot;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&quot;, and first sung at the English Congregational Church in Portland Street in Aberystwyth, where Parry worked as an organist.

===&quot;Blodwen&quot;===

Parry&#x27;s opera, &quot;Blodwen&quot;, was first performed in Aberystwyth&#x27;s Temperance Hall on 21 May 1878, although Parry did not publish it until 1888, while at Swansea. This was the first opera written by a Welsh composer and also the first opera to be performed in Welsh. The opera, with its libretto written by Richard Davies, is set during the time of the Welsh Revolt—the last attempt by the Welsh to preserve their independence.

At the time, very few people in Wales had seen an opera, and they had no idea what it was like. The opera programmes provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance that this was not a theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of &quot;Blodwen&quot; were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.

Soon after the first performance of &quot;Blodwen&quot;, a local couple named their baby daughter after the opera&#x27;s heroine. There were no recorded instances of any children being named Blodwen until after the premiere of Parry&#x27;s opera. Records show the great popularity of the name for girls and also the popularity of Howell, the name of the hero, for boys. The opera was successful, with a further 500 performances worldwide by 1896. Despite the success of &quot;Aberystwyth&quot; and &quot;Myfanwy&quot;, &quot;Blodwen&quot; seems to have been Parry&#x27;s most popular work while he was living.

===&quot;Myfanwy&quot;===
While Parry is most often thought of as the sole creator of the ballad, it was actually the work of three men. At some point, Thomas Walter Price, a poet and journalist, published a poem in English called &quot;Arabella&quot;. It is believed that Parry wrote the music before the Welsh words of &quot;Myfanwy&quot; were written by Richard Davies. Parry&#x27;s work was published in 1875, with Parry selling all rights to the song to a publisher for £12. The song was first performed at the first concert of the Aberystwyth and University Musical Society on 28 May 1875, with Parry as the conductor. It remains a standard in repertoires of Welsh male choirs today.

===&quot;Te Deum&quot;===
Edward-Rhys Harry reconstructed Parry&#x27;s setting of the &quot;Te Deum&quot; taken from the text of The Book of Common Prayer. The manuscript was discovered in the National Library of Wales archives. Parry wrote the manuscript in 1863, while living in Danville. Harry uncovered the manuscript while researching choral traditions at the library. He worked a year at transcribing the original Parry manuscript. The London Welsh Chorale gave the work its world première performance under Harry at StGiles Cripplegate, Barbican, London on 14 July 2012.

===Other works===
Parry was also involved in music-related publishing. Beginning in 1861, he was a regular contributor of Tonic sol-fa material to the Welsh music journal, &quot;Y cerddor Cymreig&quot;. Parry&#x27;s work with making Tonic sol-fa accessible allowed everyone with an interest in choral work to participate. He edited &quot;Cambrian Minstrelsie&quot; (A National Collection of Welsh Songs) in 1893. He also compiled &quot;Dr Parry&#x27;s Book of Songs&quot;, which was a collection of his own works, and wrote &quot;Elfenau Cerddoriaeth&quot; (&quot;Elements of Music&quot;), a Welsh handbook on theory, in 1888. In 1895, Parry entered into an agreement with an American music publishing firm, the John Church Company. The company published some of Parry&#x27;s songs along with English translations of poems by Heinrich Heine. The translations were done by poets of note, including James Thomson. Since it is doubtful that Parry was familiar with Heine&#x27;s work, there is the possibility that Parry was commissioned by the company to write the songs during an extensive US trip he had made the year before.

After his move to Penarth, Parry became involved in journalism, writing regular columns for both &quot;The Cardiff Times&quot; and &quot;The South Wales Weekly News&quot;. He also did some writing for the &quot;Western Mail&quot;. In his later years, Parry wrote an autobiography which has been described as inaccurate; he never published the information. The National Library of Wales acquired this manuscript in 1935 from Edna Parry Waite, Parry&#x27;s daughter and his last surviving child. The National Library published Parry&#x27;s writings as a bilingual book, &quot;The Little Hero-the Autobiography of Joseph Parry&quot;, in 2004.

Additionally Parry wrote what might very well be the first original work for brass band by an established composer, his &quot;Tydfil Overture&quot; (c. 1874-80 – i.e. &quot;pace&quot; Percy Fletcher&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Labour and Love&quot; of 1913). It has been recorded by the John Wallace Collection.

==Legacy==
===Britain===
In 1947, another son of Merthyr Tydfil, Jack Jones, based his novel, &quot;Off to Philadelphia in the Morning &quot;, on the events in the life of Joseph Parry. The book became a BBC three-part presentation of the same name in 1978 with David Lyn as Parry. Jones never offered the book as anything except a work of fiction; despite this, some aspects of the novel have been misconstrued as fact.

The centenary of Parry&#x27;s death was marked by an open air concert in Merthyr Tydfil&#x27;s Cyfarthfa Park featuring performances of Parry&#x27;s works. The concert was recorded on 28 July 2002 by Welsh television production company Avanti Media. It was broadcast by S4C on 17 February 2003. A great-granddaughter of Parry&#x27;s, who was a professional opera singer, was present for the event.

An anthem Parry composed with the Rev. Robert David Thomas while living in Pennsylvania was performed for the first time in Wales to mark the centenary of the composer&#x27;s death. There was no record of the anthem, &quot;Cymry Glan Americ&quot;, having been performed in Wales; it is not certain if the work, which was written on January 1, 1872 had ever been performed previously. A relative of Rev. Thomas located the composition and shared the information with Geraint Jones, the conductor of the Trefor brass band. Jones and his band performed the anthem on 28 May 2002 in Pwllheli at the centenary of the town hall.

In 2011 conductor Edward-Rhys Harry oversaw the total reconstruction of Parry&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Emmanuel&quot;, which was performed by Cor Bro Ogwr and The British Sinfonietta, conducted by Harry, in December of that year. In May 2013, &quot;Emmanuel&quot; was performed in the US for the first time when Harry and Côr Bro Ogwr performed in New York and Philadelphia.

===Parry&#x27;s cottage===
The cottage at 4 Chapel Row, Merthyr Tydfil, where Parry was born, is now open to the public as a museum. The row of cottages was attached to the Bethesda Chapel, where the family attended services. There are two bedrooms upstairs with the kitchen and another bedroom downstairs. The Parry family lived here with two lodgers until emigrating to the United States in 1854.

The chapel and its attached cottages were slated for demolition in 1977; efforts by the local council and students from Cyfarthfa High School saved the row of cottages, but not the Bethesda Chapel. In 1979, the Merthyr Tydfil Heritage Trust opened the cottage to the public. Exhibitions were installed upstairs in 1986 and restoration of the ground floor was completed in 1990. Parry&#x27;s home was refurbished in 2016 through funds from a local company and was reopened to the public beginning on what would have been the composer&#x27;s 175th birthday. The home is now part of the Cyfarthfa Heritage Area.

===United States===
Parry is warmly remembered, particularly at the Mahoning Presbyterian Church in Danville, where he served as organist and choirmaster. Each time he visited the US, Parry returned to the church to play the organ. The Susquehanna Valley Welsh Society holds an annual Cymanfa Canu in his honour at the church on the Sunday nearest his May 21 birthday. In 2007, the church&#x27;s steeple was restored with help from the National Welsh American Foundation. The re-dedication of the church was held on May 21, the birthday of Parry. A plaque has been placed at one of his homes in Danville; the community marked the centenary of his death at the local Danville Festival by a memorial concert of Parry&#x27;s works.

<text>Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (; 9 September 1918 – 29 January 2012) was President of Italy from 1992 to 1999. A member of Christian Democracy (DC), he became an independent politician after the DC&#x27;s dissolution in 1992, and was close to the centre-left Democratic Party when it was founded in 2007. Before his election to the Presidency, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for Turin for 44 years from 1948 to 1992.

==Biography==
Scalfaro was born in Novara, Province of Novara, on 9 September 1918, son of Guglielmo, Barone Scalfaro (born Naples, 21 December 1888) and wife Rosalia Ussino. He was raised in a religious atmosphere. He became a member of the association Azione Cattolica (Catholic Action) at the age of 12 and kept its badge on his lapel until his death.

Scalfaro studied law at Milan&#x27;s Università Cattolica and graduated on 30 July 1941. On 21 October 1942, he entered the magistrature. In 1945, after the end of World War II, he became a public prosecuting attorney, and to date, he is the last Italian attorney to have obtained a death sentence: in July of that year, along with two others, he was a public prosecutor in the trial against former Novara prefect Enrico Vezzalini and servicemen Arturo Missiato, Domenico Ricci, Salvatore Santoro, Giovanni Zeno and Raffaele Infante, accused of &quot;collaborating with the German invaders&quot;. After a three-day-long debate, all six were condemned to death. The death sentences were carried out on 23 September 1945. Later on, he obtained one more death sentence, but the accused was pardoned before the execution could take place. In 1946 he was elected to the Constituent Assembly and later in 1948, he became a deputy representing the district of Turin. He was re-elected ten times in a row until 1992. Within the Democrazia Cristiana party, he was associated with its right wing.

On 25 May 1992, he was elected as President of the Italian Republic, after a two-week stalemate of unsuccessful attempts to reach agreement. The killing of anti-Mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone prompted his election. His mandate ended in May 1999, and he automatically became a lifetime member of the Senate.

On 7 April 1994, Scalfaro co-officiated at the Papal Concert to Commemorate the Shoah at the Sala Nervi in Vatican City, along with Pope John Paul II, and Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff.

In recent times, Scalfaro was the chairman of the committee that advocated the abrogation, in the referendum of 25 and 26 June 2006, on the constitutional reform that had been passed in parliament the previous year by the former centre-right majority. Along with all the centre-left (and a few centre-right personalities, too), Scalfaro considered it to be dangerous for national unity and for other reasons. The opponents of the reform won a landslide victory in the referendum.

Scalfaro was the oldest surviving former Italian president and the second oldest member of the Senate, after Rita Levi-Montalcini. He consequently took the temporary presidency of the newly elected assembly which followed the 2006 general election, as Levi Montalcini refused the role because of her age. This made him one of the three politicians in Italian history to have presided over the three highest-ranked offices in the Italian Republic: President of the Republic, President of the Senate, and President of the Chamber of Deputies; the others are Sandro Pertini and Enrico De Nicola.

A staunch Catholic, and in the past, a rather conservative and anti-communist politician, Scalfaro nevertheless distrusted many members of the DC who changed support to Forza Italia, and was consistently on bad terms with Silvio Berlusconi. He openly supported the centre-left coalition, which included Democratic Party of the Left, which won the 1996 and 2006 elections. Despite his age, he also actively campaigned, for the &quot;No&quot; side, in the June 2006 referendum on a constitutional reform. This reform had been proposed by Berlusconi&#x27;s House of Freedom coalition during its control of the government.

During the Second World War, in 1944, Scalfaro lost his 20-year-old wife Maria Inzitari, by whom he had a daughter, Marianna. He never married again.

After the 2008 parliamentary election, he was again asked to preside as &quot;pro tempore&quot; Speaker of the Senate after Rita Levi-Montalcini again refused the post, but this time he also declined to serve.

Scalfaro passed away on 29 January 2012 in Rome.

==Honours and awards==
As President of the Italian Republic, Scalfaro was Head of several Italian Orders from 28 May 1992 to 15 May 1999: the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, the Military Order of Italy, the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity, the Order of Merit for Labour and the Order of Vittorio Veneto. Personally, he was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit for School, Culture and Art on 31 July 1973.

He also received several foreign honours:
*Knight of Magistral Grace of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (1950)
*Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta
* : Knight of the Order of the Elephant (19 October 1993)

* : Recipient of the Grand Order of King Tomislav (&quot;For outstanding contribution to the promotion of friendship and development co-operation between the Republic of Croatia and the Italian Republic.&quot; - 17 December 1997)
* : Collar of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana
* : Commander Grand Cross (or 1st Class) of the Order of the Three Stars

<doc id="1076899" wikidata="Q85816723" url="?curid=1076899" title="YoUDee">
<text>YoUDee (pronounced yoo-dee) is a mascot of the University of Delaware, along with Baby Blue. It is an anthropomorphic &quot;fighting Blue Hen&quot;, and its species is the blue hen, as the state bird of Delaware. While YoUDee appears masculine and can have male or female performers, it is &quot;officially androgynous&quot;, &quot;neither female or male&quot;.

According to the University of Delaware, YoUDee&#x27;s colors are Blue and Gold because its great-great-great-grandfather was awarded the Gold Medal for Valor during the Battle of Trenton in the American Revolutionary War. The men in the company commanded by Captain Jonathan Caldwell actually carried Blue Hens with them into combat in order to hold cockfights in their spare time. It is said that the men under Capt. Caldwell had bravery in battles that was comparable to their fighting blue hen chickens.

== History ==

=== Pre-YoUDee ===
In 1911, the University of Delaware adopted the Blue Hen as its official mascot.

In the 1930s, the initial physical mascot was a live blue chicken that was tended to by members of the cheerleading team. It is unclear if it was a blue hen, or a chicken with blue feathers, as it is believed there are no true descendants of &quot;fighting blue hens of Revolutionary War times.&quot;

Starting in 1950, several costumed &quot;Fightin&#x27; Blue Hen&quot; mascots existed. Little is known about them besides the fact that they were &quot;a variety of light and dark blue suits.&quot; Few photographs of them can be found. All of the costumes were presumably retired before YoUDee appeared.

One reader of &quot;The News Journal&quot; in Wilmington requested that one of the old mascot&#x27;s costume should be displayed in the nearby Bob Carpenter Center. This reader was not alone, as a petition with over 1,000 signatures circulated the state of Delaware, demanding the same. The Athletics Department responded and objected to the petition on the grounds that there was no room for it, and that &quot;it would be inappropriate.&quot; Articles from the time indicated that at football games, the old mascots were ridiculed and pelted with items such as &quot;marshmallows&quot; and &quot;batteries&quot; by students on a frequent basis. It is unclear if this was a recurring skit coordinated by the mascot team, or represented student emotions at the time.A successor mascot would take its place. When the University of Delaware President David Roselle was questioned as to why there would be a new mascot, he said &quot;[well], the obvious answer is, the old one wore out.&quot;

=== Hatching ===
YoUDee was first seen (or &quot;hatched&quot;) at the Delaware-Lehigh football game in Delaware Stadium on September 4, 1993, after being created by Tom Sapp of Real Characters, Inc. (an Atlanta-based advertising agency.) Student performers were scouted to wear the costume. After two students applied and performed in tryouts, Robert Boudwin became the first performer of YoUDee. Boudwin worked to build YoUDee&#x27;s personality and far-reaching image from &quot;Delaware&#x27;s infamous mascot&quot; to &quot;ass kickin&#x27; chickens.&quot; With help from David Raymond, the original Phillie Phanatic, the university mascot program has become a gateway to several professional mascot careers.

Chris Bruce, a 2002 graduate earned YoUDee its initial first-place finish. Brandon Williams, a 2003 graduate became the Baltimore Ravens mascot Poe. Other YoUDee alumni went on to perform Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; mascot Swoop, and Boudwin went on to perform as Clutch of the Houston Rockets.

Some controversy was aroused in November 1995 when YoUDee &quot;mocked&quot; middies (Midshipmen) at the United States Naval Academy. According to reports some time after the incident, the disturbance was YoUDee mooning Midshipmen, then attempting to carry away the academy&#x27;s two goat statues. It is speculated that the act was part of some fraternity hazing requirement. Though, not everyone viewed this as mocking, as there were purportedly &quot;many fans, both Navy and Delaware&quot; that enjoyed the mascot&#x27;s behavior and performance, both before and during the game.

YoUDee was &quot;listed as one of the 16 worst college mascots in the nation&quot; in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; issue in 1997. By those interviewed at the time, it is believed this designation was given because YoUDee is &quot;unique&quot; or &quot;not tough enough.&quot; In contrast, in 2005, YoUDee was chosen to star in a nationwide ESPN News advertisement, and allegedly appeared on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Hardball&quot; with Chris Matthews, and &quot;Good Day Philadelphia&quot;.

Another dispute was with concerns over a skit. In 2006, YoUDee would be carrying a cake, and a staff member would be displaying a sign that read &quot;Happy Birthday Megan!&quot; As the mascot climbed the stands, it would trip and crash into someone with the cake. Later on, the person covered in cake would be wearing a shirt that read &quot;I got caked by [YoUDee.]&quot; Sharon Harris, then Mascot Coordinator at the University of Delaware, in an interview said these skits were staged, and the person receiving the cake would always be a mascot team member.

=== Coaching ===
The program has been directed by Sharon Harris under the university&#x27;s Office of Public Relations since about 1999 until summer of 2014 when the University Athletic Department took over the oversight of the mascot program. This aligned the Cheer, Dance and Mascot programs under one umbrella of Spirit Program. This was under new Spirit Coordinator Rob Ellery who oversaw the programs until summer of 2019 when Ryan Blandford took over. Ryan was in charge through summer of 2024 when current Spirit Coordinator and long-time assistant/All-Girl Head Coach Kirby Lynch took over the mantle. 

After transition to Athletics in 2014, Chad Mills moved to the coach position where he served until 2016. From 2016 until 2021 there were various coaches, Tony Goldston, Abbie Martino and Kirby Lynch all had a hand in overseeing the team. Chad returned in 2021 and led the team through 2023. In summer of 2023, Tony Goldston a long-time assistant coach with spirit, took over the Head Coach position.

=== &quot;Hello, YoUDee!&quot; ===
Dana Davis made a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;Hello, YoUDee!&quot; which was released and published in 2013 by Mascot Books. It follows YoUDee around the University of Delaware campus before going to the &quot;stadium for the big game.&quot; While the licensed book refers to YoUDee with masculine pronouns, YoUDee has been &quot;neither male or female&quot; since 2004.

== Awards and recognition ==
On August 16, 2006, YoUDee was inducted into the NCAA Mascot Hall of Fame, at a ceremony in Philadelphia&#x27;s Love Park. This was caused in large part by &quot;YoUDee&#x27;s fan leadership.&quot;

YoUDee has participated and won the Universal Cheerleader&#x27;s Association (UCA) National Mascot Championship open division several times: 

In 2002, YoUDee won first place in the entire UCA National Mascot Championship. It is likely in 2009, the mascot competition would be split into Mascot Division IA for mascots belonging to universities with Division I football (FBS) teams, and Open Mascot for all other mascots. The latter division being the one YoUDee would compete in. YoUDee won their first national championship in 2002 which was in the single division defeating teams that now compete in Division 1A. In 2009, YoUDee&#x27;s second national championship they competed in the Open Division where they competed from 2009-2025. Starting in 2026, with the University&#x27;s move to FBS and Conference USA, YoUDee will be competing in Mascot Divison 1A.

YoUDee has also been named to Capital One All-America Mascot Team in 2003, as well as first place in several UCA Mascot summer camps.

✝Due to COVID-19, all mascots competed in one unified division. Whereas previously, YoUDee has been competing in the Open Mascot division for several years.
