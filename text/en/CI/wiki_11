<text>Norodom Sihamoni (, ; born 14 May 1953) is King of Cambodia. He became King on 14 October 2004, a week after the abdication of his father, Norodom Sihanouk.

He is the eldest son of King Sihanouk and former Queen consort Norodom Monineath and is the fourth monarch from the royal House of Norodom. Before his selection by a nine-member throne council as the next monarch, Sihamoni served as Cambodia&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations and UNESCO. He was educated in Czechoslovakia and was known for his work as a cultural ambassador in Europe and as a classical ballet instructor when he was still a prince. During his reign, Sihamoni has continued his cultural advocacy alongside supporting various philanthropic causes, while balancing his role as a constitutional monarch amid Cambodia&#x27;s political developments.

== Early life ==

=== Birth, name and family ===

Sihamoni was born on Thursday 14 May 1953, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, when it was still a colonial protectorate within French Indochina. The prince&#x27;s birth at the time was viewed as a positive omen as Cambodia gained independence from France later in that year.

His given name &quot;Sihamoni&quot; comprises two morphemes from his parents&#x27; given names &quot;Sihanouk&quot; and &quot;Monineath&quot;. As for &quot;Norodom&quot;, this means Narottam in Pali and Prakrit, which translates to &quot;the best amongst men&quot;. The name has a similar meaning in Khmer as well.

At the time of his birth and that of his younger brother, his mother Princess Monique who is of Khmer, French and Corsican descent, had been one of King Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s consorts after being a constant companion since the day they met in 1951 when she won first prize in a national beauty contest. The queen was granted the title of &quot;Neak Moneang&quot; and the name of Monineath at the time of her marriage to King Norodom Sihanouk in 1952. Furthermore, Queen Monineath is a step-granddaughter of the late Prince Norodom Duong Chakr of Cambodia, and the daughter of Pomme Peang and of her second husband, Jean-François Izzi, a Corsican banker.

Sihamoni has 14 half-brothers and half-sisters from his father; his only full sibling, a younger brother, Samdech Norodom Narindrapong, was born in 1954 and died in 2003.

=== Education and life abroad ===
The then-Prince Sihamoni first began his education in 1959, where he attended Norodom School, followed by Lycée Descartes School in Phnom Penh, developing a keen interest in the arts early on in his life.

In 1962, the young Sihamoni was sent to Prague in Czechoslovakia by his father to study abroad. There, he completed his early education at Majakovskeho Primary School and later at Ostrovni Elementary School. When he was in his preadolescence years, he starred in a production of Pyotr Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; at the prestigious Prague National Theatre, where he pursued private ballet and piano classes and was once even selected for a television rendition of &quot;Brundibár&quot;, a well-known children&#x27;s opera. He then concluded his secondary education at the National Prague Conservatory and was regarded as an able student, getting high marks. Here, he further developed his interest in the performing arts, undertaking courses in this field and excelling at the top of his class. Furthermore, he attained great fluency in Czech. A movie directed by Vladimir Sís was shot about the prince in Prague in 1967, under the name &quot;The Other Little Prince&quot; (&quot;Jiný malý princ&quot;). The prince would occasionally visit his homeland for holidays of which when he did, he involved himself in Cambodia&#x27;s arts and cultural scene, including starring in a film made by his father and performing ballet. During the 1970 coup d&#x27;état by Lon Nol that saw Sihanouk removed from power and a Khmer Republic being proclaimed, exacerbating the Cambodian Civil War, Sihamoni remained in Czechoslovakia.

Between 1971 and 1975, Sihamoni completed his higher education in classical dance and music at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, culminating with the attainment of a Master&#x27;s degree for which he wrote a thesis titled &quot;The Conception and Administration of Artistic Schools in Cambodia.&quot; After graduation in 1975, he left Prague and began to study filmmaking in North Korea at the National Academy of Cinematography in Pyongyang.

=== Return to Cambodia ===
The fall of Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975 led to the demise of the Khmer Republic and the creation of Democratic Kampuchea by the Khmer Rouge who oversaw a brutal campaign of genocide. In the following year of 1976, Sihamoni was forced to come back to Cambodia after having been deceived by the Khmer Rouge with a forged telegram, undersigned by King Sihanouk ordering his return. Immediately, the ruling Khmer Rouge regime headed by Pol Pot turned against the monarchy, and put the royal family including Sihamoni, his brother Prince Norodom Narindrapong, his mother Queen Norodom Monineath, his father King Norodom Sihanouk under house arrest in the Royal Palace. The consequent Cambodian genocide saw several members of the wider royal family killed and Sihamoni and his immediate family lived in daily fear for their lives, effectively shut off from the outside world. Throughout their period of house arrest, the prince recounted how they were prohibited from making contact with anyone and were barred from having any staff. The Khmer Rouge soldiers would give them food consisting of rice and fish that was limited to two times a week and they had to, for the most part, cultivate their food from the palace gardens. With the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, which resulted in the ousting of the Khmer Rouge in 1979 and the establishment of the Vietnamese installed People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea, the family, aided by the Chinese government, was airlifted to China. Sihamoni subsequently worked as a secretary for his father who spearheaded a resistance movement in response to the Vietnamese occupation.

=== Career ===
In 1981, Sihamoni moved to France to teach ballet as a professor of classical dance and artistic pedagogy, a position which he held for almost two decades, at various conservatoires, including the Marius Petipa Conservatory, the Gabriel Faure Conservatory and the W.A. Mozart Conservatory. He was also later president of the Khmer Dance Association there. He lived in France for nearly 20 years and continued his pursuit in the arts, establishing &#x27;Ballet Deva&#x27;, an original dance troupe, in which he served as its General Manager and Artistic Director, alongside heading the Royal Khmer Cinematic Corporation. In his line of work, he placed emphasis on giving opportunities for men to feature more prominently in traditional Khmer dance where they are often not assigned leading roles when he created &quot;Duel&quot;, a unique ballet style inspired by the Russian ballet. During this overseas period, for a time, he also entered into the monkhood under the auspices of Samdech Bour Kry, who would later become a supreme patriarch of Cambodia.

In the early 1990s, Cambodia&#x27;s Supreme National Council, which was recognized by United Nations Security Council Resolution 668 as part of the transitional process in the country under the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements, unanimously selected Prince Sihamoni in 1992 as its permanent representative to the United Nations, which he served until 1993. That same year of 1993 saw the restoration of the monarchy, with Sihanouk returning as King and the prince being appointed as Cambodia&#x27;s permanent representative to UNESCO in Paris, a role he held right until he became King in 2004. In this role, Sihamoni became known for his hard work and devotion to Cambodian culture as seen by his advocacy for the international recognition of Khmer classical ballet and shadow theatre as an intangible cultural heritage. He had previously refused an appointment as Cambodia&#x27;s ambassador to France. In October 2003, he was additionally appointed as a High Privy Counselor to then-King Norodom Sihanouk.

== Reign ==
=== Accession and coronation ===
On 14 October 2004, Sihamoni was chosen as monarch by the Royal Council of the Throne, a special nine-member constitutional body that is tasked with electing the King of Cambodia. This selection process was quickly put into place after the surprise abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk the week before. At that time, there were no provisions in the nation&#x27;s constitution that covered the subject of abdication. Prince Sihamoni&#x27;s selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and the then National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh (Sihamoni&#x27;s half-brother), both members of the throne council. King Sihanouk backed the decision as well. A few years before his selection, there was speculation about potential succession after he was seen deputizing on Sihanouk&#x27;s behalf at official functions despite him being rarely seen in public, although much of the initial speculation focused on Ranariddh who was the preferred choice of his parents, but who ultimately expressed disinterest in acceding to the throne. Sihamoni was said to have been reluctant to take on the stately role, but nevertheless accepted it in the national interest, returning on 20 October to Phnom Penh, accompanied by his parents, King-Father Norodom Sihanouk and Queen-Mother Norodom Monineath, to an estimated 100,000 people who lined their motorcade route from Phnom Penh International Airport to the Royal Palace to welcome the soon-to-be King.

Then-Prince Sihamoni&#x27;s accession to the throne was reflected upon by journalist Michael Sheridan of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; whom on 17 October 2004 remarked:

Sheridan&#x27;s reflection captured the symbolism of the moment in Cambodia&#x27;s monarchical transition as these two indelible chapters etched into its national story; the undisputed significance of King Sihanouk&#x27;s influential rule and the undeniably traumatic genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge are juxtaposed with one another as the country entered a new historical era under the reign of King Sihamoni.

He was then inaugurated and formally appointed as King on 29 October 2004 in a coronation ceremony centered at the Royal Palace in the capital. The coronation was noted for its relative simplicity, which was specifically requested by King-Father Sihanouk. King Sihamoni himself did not want the ceremonies to be too lavish because he did not wish for the impoverished country to spend too much money on the event, opting for a more modest affair. In a break with precedent, Sihamoni did not assume his seat on the higher, elevated throne nor did he wear the gold-and-diamond monarchial crown that came with the royal regalia.

In his first public speech as monarch, he acknowledged words of wisdom imparted to him by his father and pledged to be a king of the people by saying: 

In the first six months after his coronation, Sihamoni ensured to pay regular visits to his fellow Cambodians, especially those in the provinces and countryside, including occasionally making surprise visits. He was praised by observers for &quot;being close to the people and having a gentle touch&quot;, though they also noted he still needed time to independently carve out his role as monarch amid the influential role of his father, former King Sihanouk, notwithstanding his abdication.

On 29 October 2014, there were celebrations to mark the 10th anniversary of his coronation. Well-wishers representing different cross sections of the kingdom&#x27;s population congregated outside the royal palace to commemorate the occasion and pay their respects to the King.

=== Privy advisory council ===

On 12 December 2008, it was reported that Sihamoni had selected twenty-six members of the Cambodian royal family to his advisory court, among them his half-brother and former Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh as chief advisor and president of the council. Other choices included Prince Sisowath Sirirath, Princess Norodom Marie (estranged wife of Prince Ranariddh) and Prince Sisowath Thomico. The King&#x27;s half-sister and Cambodia&#x27;s former Ambassador to Malaysia, Princess Norodom Arunrasmy and uncle, Prince Norodom Sirivudh serve as members on the council as well.

As royalism has long been a staple in Cambodian political history, with periods where royalist parties had once governed the country, such as the Sangkum of then-Prince Sihanouk in the 1950s and 1960s and the FUNCINPEC party of Prince Ranariddh in the 1990s, the appointments was seen at the time by observers as signaling the cessation of royal family members participating in politics. This was because theoretically, the constitution did not allow individuals to concurrently serve in both the royal court and government. Responding to the commentary, some ruling party officials and members of the royal family insisted that there was no agenda behind the move and that it should not be construed as the prohibition or end of royal political involvement, despite the influence and electoral success of royalist political parties having waned significantly over time.

In late July 2023, upon the resignation of Prime Minister Hun Sen, it was announced that the King would appoint him to take up the position as head of the council, succeeding Ranariddh who had died in 2021. This coincided with the announcement that National Assembly President Heng Samrin, Interior Minister Sar Kheng, Defence Minister Tea Banh, and National Assembly-Senate Relations and Inspection Minister Men Sam An, the latter three of whom concurrently served as Deputy Prime Ministers, will too be appointed as privy counsellors once they have relinquished their respective positions. The appointments came into effect later in the following month.

On 4 September 2023, the King made additional appointments to the council that included former Foreign Minister Hor Namhong and former Supreme Court President Dith Munty. In January 2024, former Cambodian military leader Meas Sophea was also appointed to the council. This was followed by the appointments of former Senate President Say Chhum and former Senate First and Second Vice Presidents Sim Ka and Tep Ngorn in March 2024.

=== Political role ===
The King has limited political powers and rarely gets involved in the Cambodian political space, in conformance with his position as a constitutional monarch, and is considered to be &#x27;above politics&#x27;. Some Cambodian opposition figures, however, have called for him to be more vocal and directly involved in the political issues of the country, like his predecessor, King-father Norodom Sihanouk was, contending that the King has the constitutional prerogative to do so, in terms of powers accorded to him. Conversely, others have cautioned against this notion, citing that the constitution strictly warrants for a predominantly ceremonial monarch that &quot;shall reign but shall not govern&quot;, noting that resorting to political intervention is neither in the long-term interests of the monarchy nor nation, and Sihamoni, since the outset of his reign, has pledged and adhered to a largely apolitical stance. Indeed, during the monarchical selection process, King Sihanouk touted then Prince Sihamoni&#x27;s neutral and impartial approach to politics as a key trait for why he is suited to the role. This is reinforced by analysis from observers that Sihamoni &quot;has represented both continuity and change — withdrawing royalty from active politics, but advancing it as a symbol of national reconciliation&quot;, thereby restoring the &quot;monarchy&#x27;s traditional role as an &#x27;umbrella&#x27; under which Cambodians could unite.&quot; In turn, observers argue that this limits any politicization of the monarchy as an institution whilst maintaining its neutrality as well as legitimacy, especially amid the context of the sometimes controversial and turbulent nature of Cambodian politics.

==== Bilateral border dispute ====
Nevertheless, there have been several occasions where Sihamoni&#x27;s reluctance to be involved in the political arena have been tested. In 2005, in the first major political challenge of his reign, it was reported that he was hesitant to authorize the royal assent for the government&#x27;s plans to give effect to a controversial border treaty with neighbouring Vietnam, which was compounded by his predecessor, King-father Sihanouk&#x27;s objection. This caused tension with the government after Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed frustration about the royal assent delay to the point that abolition of the monarchy was suggested. Sihamoni eventually signed the treaty, after having been assured by government and legislative officials as well as other members of the royal family, that no land would be ceded to Vietnam as a result of the promulgation of the bilateral treaty.

==== Political pardons ====
In 2006, at the government&#x27;s petition, he granted a pardon to leading opposition politicians, namely Sam Rainsy and Cheam Channy, who originally had their parliamentary immunity annulled and were facing charges viewed as politically motivated. In regards to Rainsy, he was embroiled in a legal dispute with Prime Minister Hun Sen, over a 1997 grenade attack on a political rally, which injured Rainsy, as he was giving a speech. He had accused Prime Minister Sen of being involved, an accusation that the Prime Minister denies, though Rainsy later expressed regret in making the claim. As for Channy, he was designated as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, where he was convicted for fraud and in attempting to conspire to overthrow the government. At the time, the move by Sihamoni was found to be encouraging by international observers as it indicated a conciliatory gesture that points to a reduction of political tensions and restoration of multi-party democracy in the country.

In 2009, Sihamoni, upon considering the appeals made to him for the review of the conviction verdict against opposition-affiliated journalist and editor Hang Chakra, who was jailed on charges of &quot;criminal disinformation&quot;, sought the government&#x27;s support for a prospective royal pardon. The appeals were made to him in his capacity as a member of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy. This request was reportedly rejected by the government for reasons not stated, but it was eventually later accepted, of which Sihamoni went on to grant a full pardon to Chakra in 2010.

In late 2009, amid then-strained diplomatic relations between Cambodia and Thailand, Sihamoni pardoned a Thai national, Siwarak Chutipongse, on humanitarian grounds after a request by multiple parties, including Siwarak&#x27;s mother, the Pheu Thai Party and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Siwarak had been controversially charged and jailed by a Cambodian court for espionage due to his leaking sensitive flight-related details of Thaksin to Thai officials. Around that time, Thaksin was living in exile abroad despite being a wanted fugitive for corruption in his homeland, which he challenged. He also served as an advisor to the Cambodian government, which publicly backed Thaksin and resisted the extradition attempt from the Thai government.

==== General election of 2013 and aftermath ====
In the lead-up to the 2013 Cambodian general election, Sihamoni at the request of the government, granted a royal pardon which enabled then Opposition Leader Sam Rainsy, who had been in self-imposed exile since 2009, to partake in the election which was welcomed by the United Nations. Prior to the pardoning, Rainsy had found himself in legal jeopardy once again due to another politically-motivated charge brought against him arising from an incident in 2009. When the election outcome became disputed between the ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) and opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), the subsequent aftermath resulted in the 2013–2014 Cambodian protests.

Consequently, in what is regarded as the first time he had intervened directly to try to resolve a political dispute, the King attempted to play a mediating role and urged for national reconciliation, by exercising his moral authority to facilitate talks between the two party leaders, Rainsy and Prime Minister Hun Sen. He implored for a de-escalation of tensions, including an end to the violence between the protestors and authorities, and for the parties to find common ground towards a resolution regarding their issues. In late July 2014, the CPP and CNRP eventually reached a mutually agreed deal to resolve the political impasse.

After this, in August 2014, Sihamoni would formally swear-in Rainsy and the CNRP members of parliaments who had up until then, refused to assume their seats in the National Assembly because of the dispute, though he had earlier officiated Prime Minister Sen&#x27;s and CPP lawmakers&#x27; swearing-in ceremony in September of the previous year due to a constitutional necessity. He later encouraged the two sides to &quot;continue to work together for the sake of stability, development and national unity&quot; and for a time, there was a &quot;culture of dialogue&quot; between the rival political parties. This period of dialogue was relatively short-lived as tensions soon manifested again that culminated in the dissolution of the CNRP in late 2017 and the reallocation of the party&#x27;s seats that they won in the general election to other political parties in concurrence with the gradual persecution of members associated with the CNRP.

==== Controversial legislation ====
In the same year, a piece of legislation was introduced, named the Political Parties Law, that human rights organisations saw as a means of further curtailing the power of the opposition in the run-up to the 2018 Cambodian general election. When it came to the formalization of this law through the required royal assent, Sihamoni was coincidentally overseas, thereby delegating the royal assent duties to the President of the Senate, who constitutionally serves as the acting head of state in the King&#x27;s absence. This then prompted speculation as to whether there was an underlying reason behind the timing of his overseas trip. During the legislative processes that was taking place to enact this law, a letter additionally emerged, of which Sihamoni had encouraged for all Cambodians to vote without intimidation ahead of the 2017 communal elections. Nonetheless, officials of the ruling CPP denied such speculation and insist that the King&#x27;s trip were non-politically motivated.

Similarly, in February 2018, about the Lèse-majesté Law, which too had concerns expressed about it by various observers, speculation was fuelled again, when the King did not directly sign this legislation into law, due to a planned foreign trip. Some analysts maintained that this did not merely occur by chance, though others cautioned that such an assumption cannot be verified without actual official confirmation. Regardless, commentators noted that it added to a perception that Sihamoni tends to be overseas to avoid having to give his signature to highly contentious legislations and that such trips are supposedly timed, which then trigger a delegation of responsibility to the next constitutional office holder. It is theorized that the reason for this is that caught between the dilemmas of his position to concurrently not politically interfere and to also serve as a political guarantor, these absences are a way for the King to meet a middle ground through the &quot;symbolic denial of royal legitimacy.&quot; However, the question still remains as to whether they constitute as &quot;legitimate absences or absent legitimacy.&quot;

Interestingly, a few years prior in 2015, with respect to the then draft Law on Associations and Non-Governmental Organisations (LANGO), which was equally controversial, the King did sign this into law. This is despite the unprecedented action taken by Cambodian civil society, specifically by 26 non-governmental organisations, to directly lobby Sihamoni to not give his royal assent. They had cited his constitutional imperative as a &quot;guarantor&quot; and the proposed law&#x27;s restrictive effects on their collective ability to function effectively as key reasons for why he should agree to their request. To that end, their failed attempt in petitioning the King demonstrated constraints associated with the above-mentioned theory.

==== Elections 2018 and developments ====

In 2018, Sihamoni urged for Cambodians to vote in the national elections, notwithstanding calls made by exiled Opposition Leader Sam Rainsy to resist such a move and for the public to boycott the election. After the year&#x27;s general election and senate election, which saw the ruling CPP retaining power, winning virtually every seat in both houses of parliament, much to the consternation of members of the now-dissolved opposition, international observers and human rights groups, whom all voiced unease about the deteriorating state of political affairs in the country, not least, the lack of a viable opposition, Sihamoni convened the opening of the national legislature. He had urged parliamentarians in both the National Assembly and Senate to protect the rights of all Cambodians and seek ways to bring about national unity and in bettering the lives of the overall populace, whilst highlighting the nation&#x27;s long path towards peace and development. Several Western countries boycotted the opening, but the King noted in his speech that the opening of parliament was nonetheless constitutionally mandated.

Further, again at the request of the government, he has approved political clemency requests for several former members of the dissolved CNRP to participate in politics again, like for example in 2020, with respect to former chief whip Son Chhay and in 2021, with Pol Hom, who was a deputy party president. Both Chhay and Ham were amongst at least 32 former CNRP political figures, as of February 2022, that the King has politically rehabilitated. Sihamoni, also had granted a royal pardon for Rainsy&#x27;s deputy and later successor, Kem Sokha who had defamation charges against him stemming from an alleged adultery, though his separate treason charge remained until he was convicted in early 2023. Aside from the CNRP related cases aforementioned, other high-profile pardons include that of land rights activist Tep Vanny and Australian filmmaker James Ricketson.

==== Elections 2022 and ASEAN summit ====
In the 2022 communal elections, he reiterated his call for all eligible Cambodians to participate in the civic process by exercising their right to vote, and to &quot;not worry about oppression, threats or intimidation from any person or party at all&quot;, something that he had previously urged a few years back in the 2017 communal elections. Several political parties expressed appreciation for the King&#x27;s public appeal. The communal elections result saw a victory for the ruling CPP, although the Candlelight Party, which has links with the dissolved CNRP, made some relatively surprising gains.

At the ASEAN summit in November 2022, Sihamoni hosted regional leaders at the royal palace where he reinforced Cambodia&#x27;s commitment to the bloc of nations and emphasized the continued importance of inter-state collaboration in addressing contemporary issues. Later, at the interrelated 43rd General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, he further touched upon several topics. This included the centrality of peace in relation to socio-economic development, healthcare and educational investment, concern regarding the Myanmar conflict, the impact of increasing tensions between global powers, the threat of nuclear weapons, climate change, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== General election 2023 ====
In February 2023, several months ahead of the 23 July general election, Sihamoni once again advocated, as he has done in prior years, for electoral participation amongst the public and for free elections to take place. His call was backed by the National Election Committee whom urged the citizenry to heed the King&#x27;s message, despite insinuations of bias levelled against him by former opposition leader Rainsy. These claims were roundly rejected and condemned by government officials, including multiple cabinet ministers.

The election unsurprisingly resulted in the CPP&#x27;s victory in which they retained their ruling majority in the legislature, though there was controversy involving the disqualification of the opposition Candlelight Party by electoral authorities. On 26 July, just a few days after the election, Prime Minister Hun Sen announced his intention to tender his resignation in favour of his son, Hun Manet. Sen had an audience with Sihamoni at the Royal Palace who reportedly consented &quot;in a formality&quot; to his decision and for the transitional arrangements that was scheduled within August 2023 for Manet&#x27;s and the new government&#x27;s appointment. A royal decree was formally issued on 7 August, tasking Manet with forming a new government for the seventh mandate and requesting confidence from the National Assembly. In late August, he received the endorsement and confidence of the National Assembly to serve as head of government. Subsequently, King Sihamoni officially appointed and sworn in Manet as the second Prime Minister of his reign along with the new cabinet and members of parliament as well as officiating the inaugural opening for the new legislative term.

=== Philanthropy ===
King Sihamoni&#x27;s reign has been focused on the wellbeing of the Khmer people. He has been described by some as a humble monarch because of his philanthropic endeavours and is well-known for carrying out humanitarian activities.

This can be soon through various examples such as in 2006, where when the relocation of one of the campuses of the Royal University of Fine Arts caused an inconvenience to students and teachers, including posing safety concerns, he arranged for the donation of three minibuses to assist with transportation.
Another example was in the aftermath of the 2010 Phnom Penh stampede at Koh Pich that saw hundreds killed and injured, where he reached out to the victims and their families, donating money to every household who had lost a family member in the incident, as well as financially supporting those who were injured. In 2016, he donated a record-breaking $6.5 million from the proceeds that was gained from the selling of the royal residence in Koh Kong to the Kantha Bopha Foundation, which oversees a group of nationally renowned children&#x27;s hospitals. Furthermore, in 2018, upon learning of the plight of provincial people affected by flooding, he gave essential goods to over 500 families.

At times, he has even assisted his fellow citizens first-hand during adverse events, such as venturing out into flooded areas and handing out goods to victims directly and was once reported to have requested for his official state car to stop so he can give a blanket to an elderly Cambodian who he saw on the roadside. Additionally, Sihamoni is said to donate to the Cambodian Red Cross on a regular basis and has authorized royal grants for infrastructure, schools, orphanages, struggling communities, religious institutions, people affected by a disability, rehabilitation centres, mental health organizations, victims of violence, and sponsoring student&#x27;s trips among others. His philanthropy extends in the international context as well, like for instance, after Hurricane Katrina, the King made a personal good-will donation to victims of the storm. He has also donated towards multiple relief efforts after the occurrence of natural disasters in China.

Amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, King Sihamoni, alongside Queen Mother Norodom Monineath has donated well over $1 million to the Royal Government of Cambodia&#x27;s efforts to address the situation in Cambodia, inspiring a concerted public campaign across the country. Moreover, the King has made contributions in the provision of essential supplies, including donations of food, water and face masks to Cambodians severely impacted by COVID-19. In July 2022, he contributed $500,000 towards ongoing demining efforts in the nation, which is still plagued by problematic landmines leftover from decades of conflict.

In 2024, on the occasion of National Clean City Day, he publicly recognised and distributed goods to more than 2000 rubbish collectors for their work to upkeep the capital Phnom Penh. In the same year, to commemorate the 161st Anniversary of World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day, he and the Queen-Mother donated $100,000 to the Cambodian Red Cross.

=== Cultural advocacy ===

Sihamoni remains an ardent advocate for Cambodian arts and culture. For instance, in 2006, when he was designated by the International Theatre Institute as its &quot;Message Author&quot; for International Dance Day, he extolled the symbolism and virtue of dance, with reference to the Royal Ballet of Cambodia. In September 2012, he presided over the opening of &quot;L&#x27;ombrello di Beatocello&quot;, a documentary film by Georges Gachot showcasing the life&#x27;s work of famed Swiss pediatrician Beat Richner and his contribution to Khmer society. Likewise, in February 2017, he did the same at the global premiere of acclaimed Cambodian-based film &quot;First They Killed My Father&quot;, documenting the experiences of Loung Ung, a survivor of the Khmer Rouge and directed by Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie, whom he had earlier hosted, along with her family, at The Royal Residence in Siem Reap prior to the occasion. In March 2023, as part of the 12th Cambodian International Film Festival, he presided over the premiere screening for &quot;The Perfect Motion&quot;, a film directed by Xavier de Lauzanne, which explored the progression of the kingdom&#x27;s Royal Ballet and one of the interlinked works by Princess Norodom Buppha Devi.

The King is a strong proponent of Buddhism and of the integral place it maintains in the cultural life of the Khmer nation, and he usually officiates key festivals on the Buddhist calendar. Moreover, he supports the work of the country&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts whom reportedly engages regularly in consultations with him on advancing their overall strategic agenda. Additionally, as King, he presides over the annual Bon Om Touk, a major festive cultural event on the yearly calendar with ancient roots dating back to the Khmer Empire, in conjunction with other traditionally important national events like for example, Independence Day, the Royal Ploughing Ceremony, and Khmer New Year. He also presided over the torch lighting ceremony in March 2023 at Angkor Wat marking the start of the torch relay for the 32nd Southeast Asian Games that was held in Phnom Penh that same year in May.

Furthermore, Sihamoni has been commended for his dedication to archaeological preservation, conservation and research, with specificity to Cambodia. In particular, as Honorary President of ICC-Angkor (International Coordination Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of Historic Site of Angkor), King Sihamoni places special emphasis on the efforts to protect this national symbol and treasure, engaging frequently with the body&#x27;s work through fulfilling representative functions or routine briefings given directly to him or via a delegated senior representative. In 2011, he attended the completion ceremony pertaining to restoration works at the Baphuon historical temple in Angkor. In late 2021, he championed Cambodia&#x27;s bid for the proposed inclusion of Koh Ker, an ancient Khmer archaeological site, alongside Bokator, one of the kingdom&#x27;s oldest martial arts on the UNESCO Intangible cultural heritage and World Heritage Site lists. The eventual outcome resulted in both being successfully inscribed on to their respective listings. In November 2023, the King inaugurated the formal ceremonies to commemorate the completion of restorative works for the western causeway into Angkor Wat and its reopening, which was closed for several years due to its deteriorating condition.

=== Overseas visits ===
In the international arena, Sihamoni&#x27;s first official foreign trip as King was to China in 2004, where he met with President Hu Jintao, indicative of a strong friendship long established from the days of his father between China and the Cambodian royal family. Here, he routinely also undertakes yearly health-related visits, usually to Beijing and have formal courtesy calls with members of China&#x27;s political leadership. In 2011 he declined to attend the royal wedding of then Kate Middleton and Prince William, which some British tabloids headlined as a &quot;snub.&quot; This was quickly refuted by Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials who informed that a declination notification was indeed advised and that no snub occurred whatsoever. In 2015, he attended the United Nations COP21 summit, and gave an impassioned speech highlighting the impact of the climate crisis on Cambodia and urging international efforts on this front to be expedited. He represented Cambodia at the 2019 Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations (CDAC) in Beijing aimed at enhancing regional cooperation and intercultural exchange. Other notable trips include to Japan, where he was the first Cambodian sovereign since the monarchical restoration of the 1990s to visit, his &quot;second homeland&quot; of the Czech Republic where he spent his childhood, a landmark state visit to India, and France, Cambodia&#x27;s former colonial power.

=== Public image ===
In contrast to his father, former King Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s &quot;mercurial&quot; and outspoken reign, commentators note that Sihamoni has maintained a relatively &quot;low-key&quot; profile, with his tenure being characterized by an award-winning article of &quot;The Phnom Penh Post&quot; as being &quot;Reign of the quiet king.&quot; Nonetheless, leading national leaders across the political spectrum recognize the King as a unifying force in Cambodian society. Prime Minister Hun Sen gave praise to Sihamoni for honourably carrying out his role as a &quot;symbol of national unity, stability, happiness and prosperity&quot;, noting his humanitarianism, as well as efforts in strengthening national prestige and fostering a &quot;spirit of solidarity&quot; amongst Cambodians. Similarly, de facto Leader of the Opposition Sam Rainsy, shares this sentiment, welcoming his ability to bring people together in the national interest, although amid internal political developments that is seen as indicative of democratic backsliding, this view held by Rainsy has not always been consistent. Thus, it is within this juxtaposition, from a power politics analytical standpoint, including on the limits and extent of constitutional monarchism and given the political polarization, that there are often divergent perspectives concerning the King, between those who implore for his active politicism and those who advocate he sustain his guarded apoliticism. 

Scholar Milton Osborne, regarded as amongst the world&#x27;s most distinguished authors specializing in Southeast Asia, commends him as a &quot;dedicated servant of his people&quot; that is &quot;cultured and disciplined&quot;, but he questions the monarchical institution&#x27;s long-term survivability. The latter can be attributed in part due to competing power structures whereby there were periods of past historical tensions between some members of the royal family and the executive branch. However, in recent years, Prime Minister Hun Sen has given steadfast assurances which therefore signals his government&#x27;s intent to preserve the monarchy well into the future. Prominent Cambodian history professor Sambo Manara credits Sihamoni as a &quot;morale model&quot; for all Khmer people whom exudes a calm and kind demeanor, underscored by a sincere warmth towards his subjects, notwithstanding some misconceived notions about the King&#x27;s role from within some sectors of the population, in particular, the youth demographic.

Reflecting after a royal audience with the King in 2013, then International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde expressed how she was profoundly touched by his &quot;thoughtfulness and compassion&quot; and how he &quot;not only cares deeply about the welfare of his people, but is clearly passionately devoted to promoting the cultural and artistic heritage of his country.&quot; On the occasion of his 68th birthday, ASEAN described King Sihamoni as a monarch who is &quot;cherished and well-respected by the people of Cambodia&quot; and as someone who exemplifies &quot;dignified and humbled leadership&quot;, characterized by his frequent engagements with the populace through local visitations. The King&#x27;s birthday on 14 May in conjunction with his coronation day on 29 October are both annual public holidays in Cambodia and in 2019, a special commemorative 15,000 riel was issued in his honour, celebrating the 15th anniversary of his tenure as sovereign. Sihamoni is also featured on the 200, 500, 2,000, 10,000, 20,000 and 100,000 riels respectively and his portrait, alongside the King-father and Queen-mother is prominent across many parts of the country, illustrative of their highly revered status.

=== Lèse-majesté ===
In February 2018, the penal code was formally revised to incorporate lèse-majesté legislation, which makes it an offence to insult the king, pursuant to its promulgation by Cambodia&#x27;s National Assembly and Senate, and the law came into effect the following month. Human rights groups had voiced concerns that the law may be potentially used to suppress political opponents of the government and considered it to be incompatible with respect to the freedom of speech, though the Ministry of Justice maintains that the law is necessary in protecting the monarchy from people who push the boundaries of said freedom. After this law was enacted, there have been seldom arrests, charges and convictions, with the most notable case being that of Opposition Leader Sam Rainsy. Prior to this legislative enactment, the constitution did acknowledge the &quot;inviolability&quot; of the monarch and this constitutional provision was tested in 2017, when the Ministry of Interior pursued charges against a few individuals writing on social media.

== Personal life ==

The King is a bachelor and has no children. As Cambodia is not a hereditary monarchy, but rather an elective monarchy, his future successor will be determined by the Royal Council of the Throne, chosen from the lineage of one of the two royal houses of Cambodia, in accordance with the country&#x27;s constitution. His parents, King-Father Norodom Sihanouk and Queen-Mother Norodom Monineath, were once questioned by journalists about Sihamoni&#x27;s marital status and when he was planning to get married. In response, the Queen-Mother replied that her son &quot;only feels Buddhist&quot; and that &quot;he confines himself to Buddhism.&quot; The King-Father added that because of this, his son&#x27;s affection for women is akin to that of &quot;as his sisters&quot; and that &quot;he dares not to make a deep relationship.&quot; This reportedly reflects Sihamoni&#x27;s adherence to a monastic way of life which is underpinned by austere piety and devotion to faith. Although this &quot;lifelong bachelor&quot; status has also resulted in some interrogations and rumors about his sexuality. In some respects, Sihamoni is regarded somewhat as an enigmatic figure, with the available literature pointing to a &quot;reflective, deliberate and cultured man&quot; who apparently had reservations in becoming king, yet in spite of this, humbly assumed the solemn responsibility of his position, whilst holding &quot;his cards close to his chest.&quot;

=== Interests ===
It has been reported that the king &quot;is a man of simple tastes&quot;, with a strong interest in the arts and culture. Purportedly, in his free time he enjoys the peace of meditation, reading, exercising, listening to classical music such as by the likes of Beethoven and observance to traditional Buddhist rituals. In addition, it is reported that he enjoys comedy films, is the occasional fan of chocolates, and likes to keep up with current events and news. Moreover, alongside having an interest in DVDs relating to ballet and opera in general, he also plays piano and is reputedly a keen reader of reviews covering the Czech theatre scene.

=== Wealth ===
During speeches that Prime Minister Hun Sen delivered in November 2020 and August 2021, he made rare public references about the King&#x27;s wealth by mentioning that compared to other monarchies in the world, Cambodia&#x27;s monarchy is amongst the poorest. He further added that the King does not have his own private property. However, these factors, Sen noted were irrelevant, as more importantly, Sihamoni has a generous heart towards his people as evident by his philanthropic contributions.

=== Languages ===
Besides his native Khmer, Sihamoni speaks Czech fluently, being the only ruling monarch in the world to do so. The king is also fluent in French and is a conversational speaker of English and Russian. He has basic fluency in Mandarin as well.

=== Filmography ===

Then-Prince Sihamoni during the 1960s and 1990s starred in a few films, mainly directed by his father, who was a prolific film-maker. He has also been the subject of documentaries and directed a few films himself.
== Titles and styles ==
Before he was crowned king, his princely royal title granted to him in February 1994 by King Sihanouk was &quot;Sdech Krom Khun&quot; (), or &quot;His Royal Highness Sdech Krom Khun Norodom Sihamoni&quot;, equating him to the rank of &quot;Great Prince&quot;.

In August 2004, King Sihanouk elevated the then Prince Sihamoni to the distinguished title of &quot;Samdech Preah Boromneath&quot; ().

As King, his full regnal title is &quot;Preahkaruna Preah Bath Samdech Preah Boromneath Norodom Sihamoni Samanphoum Cheatsasna Rakhatkhateya Khemrarothreas Puthinthrea Thoreamohaksat Khemreachnea Samophorpheas Kampuch Ekreachroatboranaksanteh Sopheakmongkulea Sereyvibolar Khemarasreypireas Preah Chao Krong Kampuchea Thipadey&quot; (in romanized Khmer); , roughly translating to &quot;His Merciful Excellent Majesty Protector, King Norodom Sihamoni, who unites the nation, religion, realms, and people of Khmer state, the great king who is supported by Buddha and Indra, the protector of independence, unification, and peace, the Great King of the Kingdom of Cambodia.&quot;

The King&#x27;s shortened official title is &quot;His Majesty Preah Bat Samdech Preah Boromneath Norodom Sihamoni, King of the Kingdom of Cambodia&quot; ().

In June 2015, he was bestowed the honorary religious title &quot;Preah SriLoka Dhammika Raja&quot; (), or &quot;Virtuous King for the Propagation of Buddhism in the World&quot;, which was recommended for him at the Sixth Buddhist Summit in the year prior in December 2014.

During an overseas trip in September 2015, he was conferred the academic title of &#x27;Honorific Professor&#x27; by the Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Nanchang, China.

On 24 June 2023, the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) awarded the King the honorary title of &#x27;Royal Patron&#x27; in an event held at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh.

In the military context, one of his concurrent titular styles is &#x27;Supreme Commander of the Royal Khmer Armed Forces&#x27;, which is in line with the country&#x27;s constitution.

<text>Tlacaelel I (1397 – 1487) ( , &quot;Man of Strong Emotions,&quot; from &quot;tlācatl,&quot; person and &quot;ēllelli,&quot; strong emotion) was the principal architect of the Aztec Triple Alliance and hence the Mexica (Aztec) empire. He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I.

During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called &quot;Cihuacoatl&quot; in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive &quot;Tlatoque&quot;, until his death in 1487.

Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Durán). Durán also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated.

To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past.

When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel&#x27;s death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands.

==In popular culture==
He was the inspiration for the main character in the novel, &quot;Tlacaelel, El Azteca entre los Aztecas,&quot; (1979) by Mexican author Antonio Velasco Piña.

Amado Zumaya plays Tlacaelel in the 1990 film &quot;Return&quot; to Aztlán written and directed by Juan Mora Catlett.

<doc id="1046524" wikidata="Q1684144" url="?curid=1046524" title="List of national parks of Costa Rica">
<text>In 2023 thirty National Parks of Costa Rica are managed under the umbrella of SINAC (Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion), a department of Costa Rica&#x27;s Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE). All told, Costa Rica&#x27;s protected areas, including national parks, encompass more than 25% of the country&#x27;s total land area. Many of these protected areas are national parks.

Costa Rica&#x27;s progressive policies on environmental protection and sustainable ecotourism in the National Parks System have been lauded as a model for other countries. The rainforests, tropical forests, marine areas and wetlands of Costa Rica are the subject of many university and scientific organization studies. The enrichment of the world&#x27;s knowledge of these important habitats is an invaluable contribution from the National Parks System of Costa Rica.

The Cordillera de Talamanca is home to an impressive collection of national parks and other preserved areas, including the La Amistad International Park, which extends into Panama. On the southern Osa Peninsula is the internationally renowned Corcovado National Park, which preserves a remnant of sizeable lowland tropical rainforest that is unique in the world. Manuel Antonio National Park was listed by Forbes in 2011 among the world&#x27;s 12 most beautiful national parks.

The Camino de Costa Rica is a 280 km long hiking trail across Costa Rica. It runs from the Atlantic Ocean (Caribbean coast), the southernmost part of the Tortuguero Canals, up the mountain and through indigenous territory near the Barbilla National Park and through valleys and mountain ranges of the central region of the country, just south of the Turrialba and Irazu Volcanos and through the Los Santos coffee region down to the Pacific coast in Quepos.

<doc id="1046525" wikidata="Q1684324" url="?curid=1046525" title="Jay Heaps">
<text>John Franklin &quot;Jay&quot; Heaps (born August 2, 1976) is an American former soccer player who currently serves as president and general manager of Birmingham Legion FC. He is a former head coach for the New England Revolution in Major League Soccer.

After a successful college career at Duke University, Heaps spent his entire professional playing career in Major League Soccer, initially with Miami Fusion, and then with New England Revolution, for whom he made over 250 appearances in all competitions. Towards the end of his career Heaps also played with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team, earning four caps at the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He was coach of the New England Revolution from 2011 to 2017. He was also part of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup winning 2007 roster and was part of the 2008 North American SuperLiga winning roster. He was on the Miami Fusion team from 1999 to 2001. He then played for the New England Revolution from 2001 to 2009. He won Defender of the Year in 2009 for the New England Revolution.

==Career==
===College===
Heaps grew up in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and graduated from Longmeadow High School. He played college soccer for the Duke University Blue Devils from 1995 to 1998. He was named first team All-ACC all four of his years, was a three-time finalist for the Hermann Award, and as a senior was awarded the Hermann Trophy by the Missouri Athletic Club, marking him as the nation&#x27;s top college player. During his four years at Duke, he had 45 goals and 37 assists across 83 appearances. Additionally, Heaps played for the Duke Blue Devils men&#x27;s basketball team under Mike Krzyzewski from 1996 to 1999. He appeared in 27 games and played 68 minutes total.

===Professional===
After graduating from Duke, Heaps was drafted second overall in the 1999 MLS College Draft by Miami Fusion, and was named MLS Rookie of the Year after playing 2511 minutes for the team in midfield and defense. In his second year, Heaps was named an MLS All-Star, while registering 5 goals and six assists for the Fusion in 29 starts. 

On June 20, 2001, Heaps was traded to the New England Revolution, along with a second-round pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft in exchange for defender Brian Dunseth and a first-round pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft. He made his Revolution debut the same day, coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Matt Okoh in a 3-3 overtime draw against the Colorado Rapids. Heaps made his first Revolution start on July 4, 2001, in a 1-1 draw against the Dallas Burn, and his home debut three days later, on July 7, in a 2-1 loss to the Kansas City Wizards.

In 2002, Heaps made 27 appearances for the Revolution (26 starts), scoring 2 goals and recording 6 assists. His first Revolution goal came on June 22, 2002, in a 3-2 loss to the Kansas City Wizards. He started six matches of the Revolution&#x27;s 2002 MLS Cup playoffs campaign, scoring the Revolution&#x27;s only goal in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Final against the Columbus Crew on October 9 (which was also Columbus Day), giving the Revolution their first away playoff win in club history. Heaps was ejected from the match in the 39th minute after a clash with Freddy García, but returned to the lineup for MLS Cup 2002. 

Heaps went on to become a mainstay in the Revolution backline over the next seven seasons, leading the team in minutes played and matches started in both 2003 and 2008, and helping the club reach three more MLS Cup finals, all of which he started. Heaps also helped the club win their first two pieces of silverware, in the form of the 2007 U.S. Open Cup and the 2008 North American SuperLiga, though he missed the final due to a red card in the semifinal. 

In the 2006 MLS Cup Championship, his penalty kick was saved by Pat Onstad, winning the championship for the opposing Houston Dynamo.

In 2009, Heaps was named Revolution team Defender of the Year. He announced his retirement from soccer at the end of the season, on December 3, 2009. In total, Heaps appeared in 304 MLS matches, and retired holding the Revolution team records for games played, games started, and minutes played, ranking in the top 10 in league history in those categories.

In November 2011, Heaps was inducted into the New England Soccer Hall of Fame.

===International===
As of February 2009, Heaps had played more MLS matches (289) than any other American player who had not received a cap for the United States. On June 25, 2009, Heaps received his first call-up for the United States for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. On July 11, 2009, Heaps made his debut with the United States against Haiti.

===Post-playing career===
After announcing his retirement from professional soccer, Heaps joined Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, providing customized investment advice and portfolio management for ultra high-net-worth individuals.

In 2010, Heaps became the color commentator for the New England Revolution games on Comcast SportsNet New England, alongside Brad Feldman.

In 2018, Heaps was announced as the first president and general manager of the expansion USL club Birmingham Legion FC in Birmingham, AL.

==Coaching career==
On November 14, 2011, Heaps was named as head coach of the New England Revolution, replacing former Revolution coach Steve Nicol whose contract was not renewed following the 2011 Major League Soccer season. Heaps recorded his first win as head coach on March 24, 2012, 1-0 over the Portland Timbers. That match also featured the first goal scored under Heaps&#x27; coaching tenure, scored by Saër Sène. In the 2012, 2013, and 2014 seasons, the results of this change appeared positive. After a year of rebuilding in 2012, Heaps led the Revolution back to the playoffs in 2013 - the team&#x27;s first appearance in the MLS postseason since 2009. In 2014, the Revolution made it to the MLS Cup, narrowly losing to the LA Galaxy. However, in 2015, the team was eliminated from playoff contention in the knockout round, and in 2016, they failed to qualify entirely, but did make a run to the 2016 U.S. Open Cup final, ultimately losing 4-2 to F.C. Dallas in the final. In mid 2017, the team sat 10th out of 11 in the Eastern Conference, with SportsClubStats.com offering a 7% chance of the team making the playoffs. This led to speculation that Heaps is or should be facing removal as head coach.
On September 18, it was reported that Heaps had been fired by the Revolution and that his spot would be filled in by assistant coach Tom Soehn.

<doc id="1046535" wikidata="Q756036" url="?curid=1046535" title="Yakovlev Yak-28">
<text>The Yakovlev Yak-28 () is a swept wing, turbojet-powered combat aircraft used by the Soviet Union. Produced initially as a tactical medium bomber, it was also manufactured in reconnaissance, electronic warfare, interceptor, and trainer versions, known by the NATO reporting names Brewer, Brewer-E, Firebar, and Maestro respectively. Based on the Yak-129 prototype first flown on 5 March 1958, it began to enter service in 1964.

==Design and development==
The Yak-28 was first seen by the West at the Tushino air show in 1961. Western analysts initially believed it to be a fighter rather than an attack aircraft—and a continuation of the Yak-25M—and it was designated &quot;Flashlight&quot;. After its actual role was realized, the Yak-28 bomber series was redesignated &quot;Brewer&quot;.

The Yak-28 had a large mid-mounted wing, swept at 45 degrees. The tailplane set halfway up the vertical fin (with cutouts to allow rudder movement). Slats were fitted on the leading edges and slotted flaps were mounted on the trailing edges of the wings. The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 kN (12,795 lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similarly to the previous Yak-25. The wing-mounted engines and bicycle-type main landing gear (supplemented by outrigger wheels in fairings near the wingtips) were widely spaced, allowing most of the fuselage to be used for fuel and equipment. It was primarily subsonic, although Mach 1 could be exceeded at high altitude.

Total production of all Yak-28s was 1,180.

==Operational history==
The aircraft is perhaps best known for the heroic actions of Captain Boris Kapustin and Lieutenant Yuri Yanov after the Yak-28 they were piloting suffered a catastrophic engine malfunction on 6 April 1966. They were ordered to divert to attempt a landing in Soviet zone of Germany, but lost control of the aircraft and strayed into the airspace of West Berlin. The crew managed to avoid a housing estate but crashed into Lake without ejecting. Their bodies, along with the wreckage, were raised from the lake by Royal Navy divers (flown in from Portsmouth) and salvage specialists, who also retrieved important top secret material from the plane. This included the engines, which were taken to RAF Gatow to be inspected by RAF and American engineers. The bodies of the two pilots were returned to the USSR with full military honors from both Soviet and British armed service members, and they were both posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner. The first engine was recovered on 18 April 1966 and the second a week later; both engines were returned to the Soviets on 2 May 1966.

The Yak-28P was withdrawn in the early 1980s, but trainer and other versions remained in service until after the fall of the Soviet Union, flying until at least 1992. The reconnaissance and ECM aircraft were eventually replaced by variants of the Sukhoi Su-24.

==Variants==
===Prototype===
Yak-129
:Prototype of Yak-28.

Yak-28UVP prototype (&quot;ukorochennyy vzlyot i posahdka&quot; – short takeoff and landing)
:A single Yak-28 converted for testing short takeoff and landing techniques with JATO bottles and braking parachutes.

Yak-28SR prototype (&quot;samolyot raspylitel&quot; – spraying/dusting aircraft) first use of SR.
:Chemical warfare aircraft for dispensing dust or liquid agents from underwing tank/applicators. Though recommended for production none were delivered to the VVS.

Yak-28PM prototype

:Upgraded Yak-28P with R11AF3-300 engines, flight testing started in 1963 but development abandoned when the R11AF3-300 did not enter production.The re-engined &quot;PM&quot; modification has established a speed record of 2,400 km/h in 1963.

Yak-28URP prototype
:High altitude interceptor prototype using a rocket engine to boost performance during the interception phase.

Yak-28-64 prototype
:Extensively redesigned Yak-28P with Tumansky R-11F2-300 engines moved to the rear fuselage with intakes extending to the cockpit, intended to compete with the Sukhoi Su-15. Performance was very disappointing, being slower than the Yak-28P, and serious aileron reversal issues caused the abandonment of the Yak-28-64.

Yak-28VV proposition (&quot;vertikahl&#x27;nyy vzlyot&quot; – vertical take-off)
:A vertical takeoff and landing project, with two R-27AF-300 lift/cruise engines and four R39P-300 lift engines in the forward fuselage.

Yak-28LSh proposition
:Light attack aircraft project competing with the Ilyushin Il-102 and Sukhoi T-8, eliminated at an early stage.

Yak-28A (&quot;Izdeliye B&quot;)

:The first tactical bombing mission training aircraft type produced. The radar and avionics on board are not yet complete, so it is assumed that it will be operated during the day. Basically, it was deployed as training for changing aircraft types for crew members and as a teaching material on the ground. After that, some parts and wiring positions were reflected in later mass-produced models.

===Mass production type===

Yak-28B (&quot;Izdeliye 28B&quot;; NATO reporting name: &quot;Brewer-A&quot;)
:Production of Yak-28 with weapon-aiming radar fitted, and various improvements such as fittings for JATO bottles. Production number unknown.

Yak-28L (&quot;Izdeliye 28L&quot;; NATO reporting name: &quot;Brewer-B&quot;)
:Tactical bomber with ground-controlled targeting system using triangulation from ground-based transmitter sites. A total of 111 built.

Yak-28I (&quot;Izdeliye 28I&quot;; NATO reporting name: &quot;Brewer-C&quot;)

:Tactical bomber with the internal targeting system &quot;Initsiativa-2&quot; 360-degree ground-mapping radar. A total of 223 built.

Yak-28U (&quot;Izdeliye 28U&quot;) (&quot;uchebnyy&quot; – training) (NATO reporting name – &quot;Maestro&quot;)
:It was a dual control trainer with a second cockpit in the nose for student pilots; made as a prototype in 1962. A total of 183 were built.

Yak-28R (&quot;Izdeliye 28R&quot;; NATO reporting name: &quot;Brewer-D&quot;)
:A dedicated tactical reconnaissance version of the Yak-28I, with increased headroom under the pilot´s canopy, increased nose glazing with a sloping rear bulkhead, Initsiativa-2 radar, and five interchangeable pallets containing various mission equipment fittings. Prototype in 1963. A total of 183 built.

Yak-28SR (&quot;Izdeliye 28SR&quot;) second use of SR.
:Tactical reconnaissance aircraft fitted with an active radio/radar jammer (either SPS-141 or SPS-143). Production was on a very small scale.

Yak-28TARK (&quot;televiszionnyy aviatsionnyy razveddyvatel&#x27;nyy kompleks&quot;)
:Television reconnaissance system to send real-time images to a ground base. Backup provided by a 190 mm focal length still camera.

Yak-28RR (&quot;Izdeliye 28RR&quot;)
:Radiation intelligence aircraft with RR8311-100 air sampling pods, for gathering samples of nuclear tests. The pods were specially designed for the Yak-28RR but became standard fit for all subsequent radiation intelligence gathering aircraft. Modification of a number of existing Yak-28R aircraft.

Yak-28RL
:Radiation Intelligence aircraft conceived by fitting RR8311-100 air sampling pods, with no other specialist equipment. Modification of a number of existing Yak-28L aircraft.

Yak-28PP (&quot;Izeliye 28PP&quot;) (NATO reporting name – &quot;Brewer-E&quot;)
:Deployed in 1970, it is notable as the first Soviet electronic countermeasures (ECM) aircraft. It was unarmed, with an extensive electronic warfare (EW) suite in the bomb bay and various aerials and dielectric panels for transmitting the jamming signals. Excess heat generated by the jamming equipment was dissipated by heat exchangers under the centre fuselage; it did not include a radome. Produced in the 1970s in unknown numbers.

Yak-28P (&quot;Izdeliye 40&quot;) (NATO reporting name – &quot;Firebar&quot;)
:A dedicated long-range interceptor version, the Yak-28P was developed from 1960 and deployed operationally from 1964. It omitted the internal weapons bay in favor of additional fuselage tanks (its fuel capacity was considerable, limited by weight rather than volume), and added a new &#x27;Oriol-D&#x27; interception radar compatible with the R-98 (AA-3 &#x27;Anab&#x27;) air-to-air missile. Late production &quot;upgraded&quot; Yak-28Ps had a longer radome of pure conical shape and enhanced armament. Produced until 1967, with 435 built.

<text>German expressionist cinema () was a part of several related creative movements in Germany in the early 20th century that reached a peak in Berlin during the 1920s. These developments were part of a larger Expressionist movement in Northwestern European culture in fields such as architecture, dance, painting, sculpture and cinema.

== Characteristics ==
German Expressionism was an artistic movement in the early 20th century that emphasized the artist&#x27;s inner emotions rather than attempting to replicate reality. German Expressionist films rejected cinematic realism and used visual distortions and hyper-expressive performances to reflect inner conflicts.

== History ==


The German Expressionist movement was initially confined to Germany due to the country&#x27;s isolation during World War I. In 1916, the government banned foreign films, creating a sharp increase in the demand for domestic film production, from 24 films in 1914 to 130 films in 1918. With inflation also on the rise, Germans were attending films more freely because they knew that their money&#x27;s value was constantly diminishing.

International audiences and appreciation for German cinema began to grow as anti-German sentiment decreased following the end of World War I. By the time its 1916 ban on imports on foreign film was lifted, Germany had become a part of the international film industry.

Among the first Expressionist films, &quot;The Student of Prague&quot; (1913), &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), &quot;From Morn to Midnight&quot; (1920), &quot;The Golem: How He Came into the World&quot; (1920), &quot;Genuine&quot; (1920), &quot;Destiny&quot; (1921), &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), &quot;Phantom&quot; (1922), and &quot;Schatten&quot; (1923) were highly symbolic and stylized.

European societies of the 1920s embraced an ethic of change and a willingness to look to the future by experimenting with bold new ideas and artistic styles. The first Expressionist films, which lacked a generous budget, used set designs with wildly non-realistic, geometrically absurd angles, along with designs painted on walls and floors to represent lights, shadows, and objects. The plots and stories of the Expressionist films often dealt with madness, insanity, betrayal and other &quot;intellectual&quot; topics triggered by the experiences of World War I (as opposed to standard action-adventure and romantic films). Later films often categorized as part of the brief history of German Expressionism include &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and &quot;M&quot; (1931), both directed by Fritz Lang. This trend was a reaction against realism. Its practitioners used extreme distortions in expression to show an inner emotional reality rather than what was on the surface.

The extreme anti-realism of Expressionism was short-lived, fading away after only a few years. The themes of Expressionism were integrated into later films of the 1920s and 1930s, resulting in an artistic control over the placement of scenery, light, etc., to enhance the mood of a film. This dark, moody school of filmmaking was brought to the United States when the Nazis gained power and many German film makers emigrated to Hollywood. Several German directors and cameramen flourished in Hollywood, producing a repertoire of films that had a profound effect.

Two genres that were especially influenced by Expressionism are horror film and film noir. Carl Laemmle and Universal Studios had produced horror films of the silent era, such as Lon Chaney&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. German film makers such as Karl Freund (the cinematographer for &quot;Dracula&quot; in 1931) set the style and mood of the Universal monster movies of the 1930s with their dark and artistically designed sets, providing a model for later generations of horror films. Directors such as Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, Otto Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Carol Reed and Michael Curtiz introduced the Expressionist style to crime dramas of the 1930s and 1940s, expanding Expressionism&#x27;s influence on modern film making.

==Influence and legacy==
German silent cinema was arguably far ahead of Hollywood during the same period. Cinema outside Germany benefited both from the emigration of German film makers and from German expressionist developments in style and technique that were apparent on the screen. The new look and techniques impressed other contemporary film makers, artists and cinematographers, and they began to incorporate the new style into their work.

In 1924, Alfred Hitchcock was sent by Gainsborough Pictures to work as an assistant director and art director at the UFA owned Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam near Berlin on the film &quot;The Blackguard&quot;. The immediate effect of the working environment in Germany can be seen in his expressionistic set designs for that film. Hitchcock later said he &quot;acquired a strong German influence by working at the UFA studios&quot;.

German Expressionism would continue to influence Hitchcock throughout his career. In his third film, &quot;The Lodger&quot;, Hitchcock introduced expressionist set designs, lighting techniques, and trick camera work to the British public against the wishes of his studio. His visual experimentation included the use of an image of a man walking across a glass floor shot from below, a concept representing someone pacing upstairs.

Werner Herzog&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht&quot; was a tribute to F. W. Murnau&#x27;s 1922 film. The film uses expressionist techniques of highly symbolic acting and symbolic events to tell its story. The 1998 film &quot;Dark City&quot; used stark contrast, rigid movements, and fantastic elements.

Stylistic elements taken from German Expressionism are common today in films that need not reference contemporary realism, such as science fiction films (for example, Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, which was itself influenced by &quot;Metropolis&quot;). Woody Allen&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; is an homage to German and Austrian Expressionist filmmakers Fritz Lang, Georg Wilhelm Pabst and F. W. Murnau. The extreme angles of set decor and associated lighting were parodied by Ken Hughes in his Berlin spy school segment for the 1967 spoof version of &quot;Casino Royale.&quot;

==Set designs==

Many critics see a direct tie between cinema and architecture of the time, stating that the sets and scene artwork of Expressionist films often reveal buildings of sharp angles, great heights, and crowded environments, such as the frequently shown Tower of Babel in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

Strong elements of monumentalism and Modernism appear throughout the canon of German Expressionism. An excellent example of this is &quot;Metropolis&quot;, as evidenced by the enormous power plant and glimpses of the massive yet pristine &quot;upper&quot; city.

German Expressionist painters rejected the naturalistic depiction of objective reality, often portraying distorted figures, buildings, and landscapes in a disorienting manner that disregarded the conventions of perspective and proportion. This approach, combined with jagged, stylized shapes and harsh, unnatural colors, were used to convey subjective emotions.

A number of artists and craftsmen working in the Berlin theater brought the Expressionist visual style to the design of stage sets. This, in turn, had an eventual influence on films dealing with fantasy and horror.

The prime example is Robert Wiene&#x27;s dream-like film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) which is universally recognized as an early classic of Expressionist cinema. Hermann Warm, the film&#x27;s art director, worked with painters and stage designers Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig to create fantastic, nightmarish sets with twisted structures and landscapes with sharp-pointed forms and oblique, curving lines. Some of these designs were constructions, others were painted directly onto canvases.

German Expressionist films produced in the Weimar Republic immediately following the First World War not only encapsulate the sociopolitical contexts in which they were created, but also rework the intrinsically modern problems of self-reflexivity, spectacle and identity.

According to Siegfried Kracauer and Lotte Eisner, German Expressionist cinema operates as a kind of collective consciousness and a symptomatic manifestation of what they polemically claim to be inherent cultural tendencies of the German nation. Expressionism has also been described as focusing on the &quot;power of spectacles&quot; and offering audiences &quot;a kind of metonymic image of their own situation&quot;.
This film movement paralleled Expressionist painting and theater in rejecting realism. The creators in the Weimar Period sought to convey inner, subjective experience through external, objective means. Their films were characterized by highly stylized sets and acting; they used a new visual style which embodied high contrast and simple editing. The films were shot in studios where they could employ deliberately exaggerated and dramatic lighting and camera angles to emphasize some particular affect – fear, horror, pain. Aspects of Expressionist techniques were later adapted by such directors as Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles and were incorporated into many American gangster and horror films.
Some of the major filmmakers of this time were F. W. Murnau, Erich Pommer, and Fritz Lang. The movement ended after the currency stabilized, making it cheaper to buy movies abroad. The UFA financially collapsed and German studios began to deal with Italian studios which led to their influence in style of horror and films noirs. The American influence on the film industry would also lead some film makers to continue their career in the US. The UFA&#x27;s last film was &quot;Der blaue Engel&quot; (1930), considered a masterpiece of German Expressionism.

==Interpretation==
The two most comprehensive studies of German Expressionist film are Lotte Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Screen&quot; and Siegfried Kracauer&#x27;s &quot;From Caligari to Hitler&quot;. Kracauer examines German cinema from the Silent/Golden Era to support the (controversial) conclusion that German films made prior to Hitler&#x27;s takeover and the rise of the Third Reich all hint at the inevitability of Nazi Germany. For Eisner, similarly, German Expressionist cinema is a visual manifestation of Romantic ideals turned to dark and proto-totalitarian ends. More recent German Expressionist scholars examine historical elements influencing German Expressionism, such as the Weimar economy, UFA, Erich Pommer, Nordisk, and Hollywood.

<doc id="1046543" wikidata="Q6591" url="?curid=1046543" title="Speculaas">
<text>Speculaas (; ; ) is a type of spiced shortcrust biscuit originated in the Low Countries (Belgium and the Netherlands) and baked with speculaas spices, which is a mix of 80% cinnamon, and 20% other spices: nutmeg, clove, ginger, cardamom and pepper, the exact proportions were often a signature and secret of the bakery who made them. They are usually flat, crisp and moulded to carry certain traditional images. Historically it was popular to eat speculaas around the feast of Saint Nicholas (Dutch: &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;). The oldest sources on speculaas also mention weddings and fairs. However, in the Low Countries it has become normal to eat speculaas all year round, especially with coffee or tea, or with ice cream. Although speculaas stuffed with almond paste (Dutch: &quot;gevulde speculaas&quot;) and the thicker speculaas chunks (Dutch: &quot;speculaasbrokken&quot;) remain a specialty of the holiday season.

Apart from Belgium and the Netherlands, it is also well known in adjacent areas in Luxembourg, northern France, and in the west of Germany (Westphalia and the Rhineland). It gained popularity in the former Yugoslav countries, where it is manufactured by the Croatian food company Koestlin. The cookie can also be found in Indonesia and is usually served there at Christmas or on other special occasions.

== Etymology ==
The Dutch name &quot;speculaas&quot; evolved from the older form &quot;speculatie&quot; (speculation), used to mean &quot;desire&quot; or &quot;pleasure&quot;. Originally, &quot;speculatie&quot; described fine baked goods, appealing to sophisticated tastes. Over time, this term developed dialectal variations like &quot;speculacie&quot; and &quot;speculasie&quot;, in which later the ie-suffix was erroneously interpreted as diminutives —eventually resulting in the non-diminutive form we know today as &quot;speculaas&quot;. 

In Belgium, a variant called &quot;speculoos&quot; arose, especially in French-speaking regions. &quot;Speculoos&quot;, thought to derive from a Brabantian dialect pronunciation, omits the traditional spices in favour of caramelized sugar for flavour. It became internationally popular, especially with the introduction of speculoos cookie butter.

== History ==
Speculaas roots go back to the &quot;klaaskoek&quot; or &quot;Saint Nicholas cake&quot;, a festive treat linked to Saint Nicholas Day on December 6. These early &quot;klaaskoeken&quot; were among the precursors to what we now recognize as speculaas. Speculaas likely originated in the Low Countries during the Middle Ages, when exotic spices arrived via expanding trade routes. Once a luxury treat, it became associated with Saint Nicholas festivities, often featuring figures of the saint or festive symbols. As the Dutch spice trade grew in the 17th century, speculaas became more accessible.

<doc id="1046545" wikidata="Q3492932" url="?curid=1046545" title="Araucanía (historic region)">
<text>Araucanía or Araucana was the Spanish name given to the region of Chile inhabited by the Mapuche peoples known as the Moluche (also known as Araucanos by the Spanish) in the 18th century. Prior to the Spanish conquest of Chile, the lands of the Moluche lay between the Itata River and Toltén River.

==History==
Following the great rising of the Moluche and Huilliche after the Battle of Curalaba in 1598 during the Arauco War, they expelled the Spanish from south of the Bío-Bío River. After many decades of further warfare, the bounds of Araucania were recognized by the Spanish as being between the Bío-Bío and Toltén rivers. This old region of Araucanía now is divided between the southern part of the Bío-Bío Region and the Araucanía Region in southern Chile.

<doc id="1046549" wikidata="Q389701" url="?curid=1046549" title="Technorati">
<text>Technorati is a search engine and a publisher advertising platform. Technorati launched its ad network in 2008.

In 2016, Synacor acquired Technorati for $3 million.

The company&#x27;s core product was previously an Internet search engine for searching blogs. The website stopped indexing blogs and assigning authority scores in May 2014 with the launch of its new website, which is focused on online publishing and advertising. Technorati was founded by Dave Sifry, with its headquarters in San Francisco. Kevin Marks was the site&#x27;s Principal Engineer. Tantek Çelik was the site&#x27;s Chief Technologist.

The site won the SXSW 2006 awards for Best Technical Achievement and Best of Show. It was nominated for a 2006 Webby Award for
Best Practices, but lost to Flickr and Google Maps.

== Reception ==
In February 2006, Debi Jones pointed out that Technorati&#x27;s &quot;State of the Blogosphere&quot; postings, which then claimed to track 27.7 million blogs, did not take into account MySpace blogs, of which she said that there were 56 million. As a result, she said that the utility of Technorati as a gauge of blog popularity was questionable. However, by March 2006, Aaron Brazell pointed out that Technorati had started tracking MySpace blogs.

In May 2006, Technorati teamed up with the PR agency Edelman. The deal earned a lot of criticism, both on principle and as a result of Edelman&#x27;s 2006 fake blog scandals. Edelman and Technorati officially ended the deal in December 2006. That month, Oliver Reichenstein pointed out that the so-called &quot;State of the Blogosphere&quot; was more of a PR-tool and money maker for Edelman and Technorati than a reliable source, explaining in particular: a) why Technorati/Edelman&#x27;s claim that &quot;31% of the blogs are written in Japanese&quot; was &quot;bogus&quot;, and b) where the financial profit for the involved parties was in this.

In May 2007, Andrew Orlowski, writing for the tech tabloid &quot;The Register&quot;, criticized Technorati&#x27;s May 2007 redesign. He suggested that Technorati had decided to focus more on returning image thumbnails rather than blog results. He also claimed that Technorati never quite worked correctly in the past and that the alleged refocus was &quot;a tacit admission that it&#x27;s given up on its original mission&quot;.

In August 2008, Technorati acquired the online magazine, Blogcritics, for an undisclosed sum of money. As a result, Blogcritic&#x27;s founders – publisher Eric Olsen and technical director Phillip Winn – became full-time Technorati employees. One of the first collaborative ventures of the two entities was for Blogcritics writers to begin writing descriptions of Technorati tags.

In October 2008, Technorati acquired the online ad agency Adengage. Technorati CEO Richard Jalichandra wanted to use the AdEngage platform to expand Technorati Media&#x27;s offering, starting with an expansion of their advertising business from higher traffic sites. The AdEngage
network added a reported 12 billion monthly impression growth to the Technorati Media Network.

In April 2009, Blogcritics underwent a complete site redesign and switched content management systems.

In 2009, Technorati decided to stop indexing blogs and sites in languages other than English in order to focus only on the English-language blogosphere. As a result, thousands of sites in various languages were no longer rated by the Technorati service. In 2014, Technorati stopped indexing blogs altogether, refocusing its efforts on its advertising business.

In 2016, Synacor acquired Technorati for $3 million.

<doc id="1046550" wikidata="Q1072339" url="?curid=1046550" title="Chief marketing officer">
<text>A chief marketing officer (CMO), also called a chief brand officer (CBO), is a C-suite corporate executive responsible for managing marketing activities in an organization. The CMO leads brand management, marketing communications (including advertising, promotions and public relations), market research, product marketing, distribution channel management, pricing, customer success, and customer service.

The CMO typically reports to the chief executive officer and may be reported to by senior vice presidents, vice presidents, directors, and other senior marketing managers. Historically, some jurisdictions have conferred legal responsibility upon marketing chiefs, but the use of modern-day titles typically does not correspond to a legally defined role.

A study from consulting firm Spencer Stuart in 2021 showed that women made up 47% of CMO positions in 2020, an increase from the 43% reported in 2019. 13% of CMOs had a racially or ethnically diverse background in 2020, down from 14% in 2019.

== Responsibilities ==
As part of the senior management, the CMO is involved in developing and adjusting company strategy and plans based on market conditions and competitive dynamics. CMOs may be involved in departments such as production, information technology, corporate communications, documentation, public relations, law, human resources, and finance. One Gartner analyst predicted that in the future CMOs will spend more on IT than their counterpart CIOs, with many modern CMOs handling increasing amounts of customer-facing technology implementations. According to McKinsey, few senior-executive positions will be subject to as much change over the next few years as that of the chief marketing officer.

The CMO is responsible for facilitating growth, sales and marketing strategy. They work towards objectives such as revenue generation, cost reduction, or risk mitigation. The CMO completes tasks that fall into three different categories: Analytical tasks, such as pricing and market research; creative tasks, such as graphic design, advertising and product, and service promotion; and interpersonal tasks, such as coordinating with other company executives in creating alignment on strategy and execution plans. 

CMOs see customer loyalty as their top priority in the digital era; their second priority is to design experiences for tablets and mobile apps.

==Challenges==
The unpredictable effect of marketing efforts and the need to drive profits often leads to a short tenure for most CMOs. Consulting firm Spencer Stuart revealed average CMO tenure in 2020 was 40 months, which was the lowest in a decade. In comparison, the average CEO tenure is 7 years.

In a CMO mapping study done by Raines, CMOs are losing influence. A proportion of CMOs don&#x27;t feel valued, and many CMOs don&#x27;t have clear alignment with their CEOs on key performance metrics.

<doc id="1046551" wikidata="Q768605" url="?curid=1046551" title="The Carpathian Castle">
<text>The Carpathian Castle () is a Gothic novel by Jules Verne first published in 1892. It is possible that Bram Stoker took inspiration from this for his 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. Due to castle aspect and local toponymy, it is assumed that in Hunedoara county inspired Jules Verne. Probable inspiration for Verne was his extended stay in Bratislava and the Devín castle in present day Slovakia, where he also wrote his novel The Danube Pilot.

==Title==
The original French title was &quot;Le Château des Carpathes&quot;, and in English there are some alternate titles, such as The Castle of the Carpathians, The Castle in Transylvania, and Rodolphe de Gortz; or the Castle of the Carpathians.

==Synopsis==
In the village of Werst in the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania (in the then Austria-Hungary), some mysterious things are occurring and the villagers believe that Chort (the devil) occupies the castle. A visitor to the region, Count Franz de Telek, is intrigued by the stories and decides to go to the castle and investigate. He finds that the owner of the castle is Baron Rodolphe de Gortz, with whom he is acquainted; years earlier, they were rivals for the affections of the celebrated Italian prima donna La Stilla. The Count thought that La Stilla was dead, but he sees her image and hears her voice coming from the castle. It is later revealed that it was only a projected still image accompanying a high-quality phonograph recording.

==In the media==
* The 1981 Czechoslovak comedy feature film &quot;The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians&quot; is based on this novel.

<doc id="1046559" wikidata="Q279378" url="?curid=1046559" title="Dracula (1931 English-language film)">
<text>Dracula is a 1931 American pre-Code supernatural horror film directed and co-produced by Tod Browning from a screenplay written by Garrett Fort and starring Bela Lugosi in the title role. It is based on the 1924 stage play &quot;Dracula&quot; by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, which in turn is adapted from the 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker. Lugosi portrays Count Dracula, a vampire who emigrates from Transylvania to England and preys upon the blood of living victims, including a young man&#x27;s fiancée.

Produced and distributed by Universal Pictures, &quot;Dracula&quot; is the first sound film adaptation of the Stoker novel. Several actors were considered to portray the title character, but Lugosi, who had previously played the role on Broadway, eventually got the part. The film was partially shot on sets at Universal Studios Lot in California, which were reused at night for the filming of a concurrently produced Spanish-language adaptation of the same name, also produced by Universal.

&quot;Dracula&quot; was a commercial and critical success upon release, and led to several sequels and spin-offs. It has had a notable influence on popular culture, and Lugosi&#x27;s portrayal of Dracula established the character as a cultural icon, as well as the archetypal vampire in later works of fiction. In 2000, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Renfield is a solicitor traveling to Count Dracula&#x27;s castle in Transylvania on a business matter. The local village people fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the village inn and asks his carriage driver to take him to the Borgo Pass. He is driven to the castle by Dracula&#x27;s coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.

Renfield enters the castle and is welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who, unbeknownst to Renfield, is a vampire. They discuss Dracula&#x27;s intention to lease Carfax Abbey in England, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. Renfield faints as a bat appears, and Dracula&#x27;s three wives close in on him. Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself.

Aboard the schooner &quot;Vesta&quot;, Renfield has become a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides in a coffin and feeds on the ship&#x27;s crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person. He is sent to Dr. Seward&#x27;s sanatorium adjoining Carfax Abbey. Elsewhere, at a London theater, Dracula meets Seward. Seward introduces his daughter Mina, her fiancé John Harker, and a family friend, Lucy Weston. Lucy is fascinated by Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. She dies the next day after a string of blood transfusions.

Renfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. Polymath doctor Professor Van Helsing analyzes his blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon, Renfield begs Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina&#x27;s dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield through the medium of a wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him wolfsbane, which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.

Dracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, he enters for a visit, and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a mirror reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.

Mina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. The maid finds her. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety but is convinced to leave her with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs to take care of Mina when she sleeps and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.

Renfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discussing vampires. Before he is taken back to his cell, Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanatorium by promising him thousands of rats full of blood and life. Dracula enters the Seward parlor and talks with Van Helsing. He states that Mina now belongs to him and warns Van Helsing to return to his home country. Van Helsing swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the latter&#x27;s resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he draws a crucifix from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.

Harker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves &quot;nights and fogs&quot;. A bat flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then attacks Harker, but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her and tells Harker their love is finished.

Dracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina&#x27;s neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. Arriving there, they see Dracula with Mina. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula thinks Renfield has betrayed him by leading them there and shoves him down the staircase to his death. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker, who know that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising. Van Helsing prepares a makeshift wooden stake from Dracula&#x27;s coffin lid while Harker searches for Mina. Van Helsing impales Dracula through the heart, killing him, and Mina returns to normal.

The following individuals appear in uncredited roles: director and co-producer Tod Browning as the off-screen voice of the harbormaster; Carla Laemmle, a cousin of producer Carl Laemmle Jr., who appears at the start of the film as a woman in the coach carrying Renfield; and Geraldine Dvorak, Cornelia Thaw, and Dorothy Tree as Dracula&#x27;s brides.

==Background==
Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel had already been filmed without permission as &quot;Nosferatu&quot; in 1922 by German Expressionist filmmaker F. W. Murnau. Stoker&#x27;s widow sued for plagiarism and copyright infringement, and the courts decided in her favor, essentially ordering that all prints of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; be destroyed. Enthusiastic young Hollywood producer Carl Laemmle Jr. also saw the box office potential in Stoker&#x27;s gothic chiller, and he legally acquired the novel&#x27;s film rights. Initially, he wanted &quot;Dracula&quot; to be a spectacle on a scale with the lavish silent films &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925).

Universal Pictures paid $40,000 for all rights to the novel and the stage plays, so they would have the exclusive rights to the Dracula character. Universal also brought Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Louis Bromfield to pen the script to fit this grand scale vision. Bromfield tried to reconcile novel and the stage play and in his draft suggested that Dracula should be two people—ghoulish old man at the beginning of the film, who by traveling to London and feeding on blood gets rejuvenated into drawing-room Dracula of the theater. Jonathan Harker was supposed to travel to Transylvania in the opening scenes of the film. As in the stage play, Dracula was supposed to kiss Mina passionately on the lips. Those things never made it into movie, either because they were considered too expensive, were replaced by rewritten scenes, or were deemed too risky. Bromfield was soon replaced with Garrett Fort.
Fort turned to the stage play. Already a huge hit on Broadway, the Deane/Balderston &quot;Dracula&quot; play would end up becoming the blueprint as the production gained momentum. The screenwriters also carefully studied the silent, unauthorized version, F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, for inspiration. Lifted directly from a nearly identical scene in &quot;Nosferatu&quot; that does not appear in Stoker&#x27;s novel, was the early scene at the Count&#x27;s castle when Renfield accidentally pricks his finger on a paper clip and it starts to bleed. Dracula creeps toward him with glee, only to be repelled when the crucifix falls in front of the bleeding finger.

==Production==

The film was originally intended for Conrad Veidt, who had just appeared in Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Last Performance&quot; (1929). When Veidt returned to Germany fearing his English was not good enough for talkies Universal looked to Lon Chaney, star of the studio&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925). Although at the time Chaney was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and had already decided a remake of &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1930) would be his first sound film. After his sudden death casting the title role proved problematic. Initially Laemmle was not at all interested in Lugosi, in spite of good reviews for his stage portrayal. Laemmle instead considered more established screen actors, with John Wray, fresh from his success in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) being announced as cast in the role. Both Ian Keith and William Courtenay would be subsequently mentioned in the press of the time, with other actors considered including Paul Lukas, Paul Muni, Chester Morris and Joseph Schildkraut. Lugosi had played the role on Broadway, and to his good fortune, happened to be in Los Angeles with a touring company of the play when the film was being cast. Against the tide of studio opinion, Lugosi lobbied hard and ultimately won the executives over, thanks in part to him accepting a paltry $500 per week salary for seven weeks of work, amounting to $3,500.Lew Ayres was hired to play Jonathan Harker, only to be replaced with Robert Ames because of a filming conflict. Ames was himself replaced with David Manners following news reports of his messy divorce.

On September 29, 1930, Dracula began shooting at Universal City on a $355,050 budget on a 36-day schedule. Tod Browning shot scenes of Dracula&#x27;s Castle and Borgo Pass all the first week of production. According to numerous accounts, the production is alleged to have been a mostly disorganized affair, with the usually meticulous Tod Browning leaving cinematographer Karl Freund to take over during much of the shoot, making Freund something of an uncredited director on the film.

Manners recalled about the filming: &quot;I can still see Lugosi, parading up and down the stage, posing in front of a full-length mirror, throwing his cape over his shoulder and shouting, &#x27;I am Dracula!&#x27; He was mysterious and never really said anything to the other members of the cast except good morning when he arrived and good night when he left. He was polite, but always distant&quot;. Lugosi struck Manners as a vain, eccentric performer: &quot;I never thought he was acting, but being the odd man he was&quot;. Edward Van Sloan, who played Van Helsing on Broadway stage opposite Lugosi, reprised his role on screen. The actor wondered why the film version reduced the large mirror used in the play to the small cigarette box with a mirrored lid. Despite Van Helsing becoming one of his most famous screen roles Van Sloan did not think much about the film – in a letter to his nephew he once wrote: &quot;That reminds me of your failure to see the Dracula film on TV. How lucky you were... What must it be like today...! Overplayed — over-written — altogether lousy&quot;. Bernard Jukes, who played the role of Renfield in the play on Broadway and during the 1928 tour, wanted that part in the film, but it went to Dwight Frye instead.

Tod Browning remembered actress Helen Chandler from the 1928 Broadway play &quot;The Silent House&quot; and based on that maiden performance chose her for Mina, the heroine, who becomes mistress to Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Count Dracula. Her salary was $750 per week, making her the highest paid member of the cast. At the time of the filming she already battled severe alcoholism. She was known to laugh at Lugosi&#x27;s mirror ritual at the shooting at times. Like some of her co-stars, despite this role becoming her most famous one, she did not care much about it: &quot;It would be an awful fate, for instance, to go around being a pale little girl in a trance with her arms outstretched as in &quot;Dracula&quot;, all the rest of my screen career!&quot;

The peasants at the beginning are praying in Hungarian, and the signs in the village are also in Hungarian. That is because many Hungarians live near Borgo Pass in Transylvania, since Transylvania used to be part of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By the time the film was made, Transylvania had been part of the Kingdom of Romania since the end of World War I in 1918.

The scenes of crew members on the ship struggling in the violent storm were lifted from a Universal silent film, &quot;The Storm Breaker&quot;. Photographed at silent film projection speed, this accounts for the jerky, sped-up appearance of the footage when projected at 24 frames per second sound film speed and cobbled together with new footage of Dracula and Renfield. Jack Foley himself was the Foley artist who produced the sound effects. The picture was completed for a total cost of $341,191.20, which was under the original estimate of $355,050.

Before the film was even released, Lugosi worried that it would cause him to be type cast. He reportedly rejected an offer to reprise his role as Dracula in another stage tour of the play, stating: &quot;No! Not at any price. When I&#x27;m through with this picture I hope to never hear of Dracula again. I cannot stand it...I do not intend that it shall possess me&quot;.

===Cinematic process===
The film&#x27;s histrionics from the stage play are also reflected in its special effects, which are limited to fog, lighting, and large flexible bats. Dracula&#x27;s transition from bat to person is always done off-camera. The film also employs extended periods of silence and character close-ups for dramatic effect, and employs two expository intertitles and a closeup of a newspaper article to advance the story, a seeming holdover from silent films; a point made by online film critic James Berardinelli is that the actors&#x27; performance style seems to belong to the silent era. Director Tod Browning had a reputation as a silent film director, having made them since 1915, including ten horror blockbusters with Lon Chaney including &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1927), but he never felt completely at ease with sound films. He only directed six more films over an eight-year period, the best known being the notorious &quot;Freaks&quot;, a horror film with Olga Baclanova and a cast of actual carnival freaks that was pulled from distribution immediately but is a cult favorite today. Browning directed his last film in 1939.

==Music==
Owing to the costs of adding an original musical score to a film&#x27;s soundtrack, no score had ever been composed specifically for the film. The music heard during the opening credits, an excerpt from Act II of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, was later re-used for another Universal horror film, &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932). During the theater scene where Dracula meets Dr. Seward, Harker, Mina, and Lucy, the end of the overture to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; can also be heard as well as the dark opening of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot; in B minor.

===1998 score===
In 1998, composer Philip Glass was commissioned to compose a musical score for the film. The score was performed by the Kronos Quartet under the direction of Michael Reisman, Glass&#x27;s usual conductor.

Of the project, Glass said: &quot;The film is considered a classic. I felt the score needed to evoke the feeling of the world of the 19th century — for that reason I decided a string quartet would be the most evocative and effective. I wanted to stay away from the obvious effects associated with horror films. With [the Kronos Quartet] we were able to add depth to the emotional layers of the film&quot;.

The film, with this new score, was released by Universal Studios in 1999 in the VHS format. Universal&#x27;s DVD releases allow the viewer to choose between the unscored soundtrack or the Glass score. The soundtrack, &quot;Dracula&quot;, was released by Nonesuch Records in 1999. Glass and the Kronos Quartet performed live during showings of the film in 1999, 2000, 2012 and 2017.

==Release==
&quot;Dracula&quot; was a big gamble for a major Hollywood studio to undertake. In spite of the literary credentials of the source material, it was uncertain if an American audience was prepared for a serious full length supernatural chiller. Though American audiences had been exposed to other chillers before, such as &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1927), this was a horror story with no comic relief or trick ending that downplayed the supernatural. Despite this, &quot;Dracula&quot; proved to be a box office success.

When the film finally premiered at the Roxy Theatre in New York City on February 12, 1931 (released two days later throughout the U.S.), newspapers reported that members of the audiences fainted in shock at the horror on screen. This publicity, shrewdly orchestrated by the film studio, helped ensure people came to see the film, if for no other reason than curiosity. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York&#x27;s Roxy Theatre, it had sold 50,000 tickets, building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal&#x27;s 1931 releases.

===Critical reception===

The film was generally well received by critics upon its release. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the best of the many mystery films&quot;, characterizing Browning&#x27;s direction as &quot;imaginative&quot; and Helen Chandler&#x27;s performance as &quot;excellent&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film for its &quot;remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere&quot; and wrote: &quot;It is difficult to think of anybody who could quite match the performance in the vampire part of Bela Lugosi, even to the faint flavor of foreign speech that fits so neatly&quot;. &quot;Film Daily&quot; declared the film &quot;a fine melodrama&quot; and remarked that Lugosi had created &quot;one of the most unique and powerful roles of the screen&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;an exciting melodrama, not as good as it ought to be but a cut above the ordinary trapdoor-and-winding-sheet type of mystery film&quot;. John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote a negative review, remarking that &quot;there is no real illusion in the picture&quot; and &quot;this whole vampire business falls pretty flat&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; did not think the film was as scary as the stage version, calling its framework &quot;too obvious&quot; and &quot;its attempts to frighten too evident&quot;, but still concluded that it was &quot;quite a satisfactory thriller&quot;.

==Censorship==

The film was originally released with a running time of 85 minutes; when it was reissued in 1936, the Production Code was enforced. For that reissue, two scenes are known to have been censored:
* The most significant deletion was an epilogue which played only during the film&#x27;s initial run. In a scene similar to the prolog from &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and also featuring Universal stalwart Edward Van Sloan, he reappeared in a &quot;curtain speech&quot; and informed the audience: &quot;Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen! A word before you go. We hope the memories of Dracula and Renfield won&#x27;t give you bad dreams, so just a word of reassurance. When you get home tonight and the lights have been turned out and you are afraid to look behind the curtains—and you dread to see a face appear at the window—why, just pull yourself together and remember that after all, there &quot;are&quot; such things as vampires!&quot; This epilogue was removed out of fear of encouraging a belief in the supernatural. This scene was briefly shown in the &quot;Road to Dracula&quot; documentary, but it may be unusable and can not be restored.
* Audio of Dracula&#x27;s off-camera &quot;death groans&quot; at the end of the film were shortened by partial muting, as were Renfield&#x27;s screams as he is killed; these pieces of soundtrack were later restored by MCA-Universal for its LaserDisc and subsequent DVD releases (with the exception of the 2004 multi-film &quot;Legacy Collection&quot; edition).

==Alternate versions==
In the early days of sound films, it was common for Hollywood studios to produce &quot;Foreign Language Versions&quot; of their films using the same sets, costumes and so on. While Browning filmed during the day, at night George Melford was using the sets to make the Spanish-language version &quot;Drácula&quot;, starring Carlos Villarías as Conde Drácula. Long thought lost, a print of &quot;Drácula&quot; was discovered in the 1970s, of which large sections had rotted away. In the early 1990s, a good copy was found in Cuba. The film was preserved in the US National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.

A third, silent, version of the film was also released. In 1931, some theaters had not yet been wired for sound, and during this transition period many studios released alternative silent versions with intertitles.

==Legacy==
===Retrospective assessments===
In 1999, film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, praising Lugosi&#x27;s performance and Freund&#x27;s cinematography. He noted the film&#x27;s lasting influence, and included it in his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot;. Angie Errigo of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, commending Lugosi&#x27;s performance as &quot;the [Dracula] against which all others are measured&quot;, and writing that the film &quot;is stagey and creaky, but it also has wonderful, unforgettable moments&quot;. John Oliver of the British Film Institute credited the film with establishing the &quot;popular on-screen image of the vampire&quot; and wrote that &quot;the cinematic horror genre was born with the release of &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;. He concluded that although he feels the film becomes almost &quot;overly stage bound in its middle section, the virtues of its star performance and general visual style outweigh any such deficits&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 7.86/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s timeless portrayal of Dracula in this creepy and atmospheric 1931 film has set the standard for major vampiric roles since&quot;.

===Sequels and influence===

After the commercial and critical success of &quot;Dracula&quot;, Universal released &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) later that same year. Universal in particular would become the forefront of early horror cinema, with a canon of films including &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933), &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), and &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941).

Five years after the original release, Universal released &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1936), a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; (1943), starring Lon Chaney Jr., followed another seven years later. The Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944); &quot;House of Dracula&quot; (1945); and the comedy &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948).

Universal would only cast Lugosi as Dracula in one more film, the aforesaid Abbott and Costello vehicle, giving the role to John Carradine for the mid-1940s &quot;monster rally&quot; films, although Carradine admittedly more closely resembled Stoker&#x27;s physical description from the book. Many of the familiar images of Dracula are from stills of the older Lugosi made during the filming of the 1948 comedy, so there remain two confusingly distinct incarnations of Lugosi as Dracula, seventeen years apart in age.

As Lugosi played a vampire in three other movies during his career (&quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; (1935), &quot;The Return of the Vampire&quot; (1943), and &quot;Mother Riley Meets the Vampire&quot; (1952)), this contributed to the public misconception that he portrayed Dracula on film many times, although the other vampire roles had him playing Dracula in all but name.

Director Chris McKay referenced &quot;Dracula&quot; in his film &quot;Renfield&quot; (2023), a film referred to by the director as a &quot;quasi-sequel&quot; to the original 1931 film. The film features Nicolas Cage as Count Dracula and Nicholas Hoult as Renfield compositing them into the background in place of Lugosi and Frye.

Since its release, &quot;Dracula&quot; has become widely regarded as a classic of the era and of its genre. In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It was also ranked 79th on Bravo&#x27;s countdown of &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;.

However, Dracula would ultimately become a role which would prove to be both a blessing and a curse. Despite his earlier stage successes in a variety of roles, from the moment Lugosi donned the cape on screen, it would forever see him typecast as the Count.

Browning would go on to direct Lugosi once more in another vampire thriller, &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot;, a 1935 remake of Browning&#x27;s lost silent film &quot;London After Midnight&quot; (1927) starring Lon Chaney.

Also, the film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – #85
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Count Dracula – #33 Villain
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Count Dracula: &quot;Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make.&quot; – #83

====Influence on other notable Draculas====
The actors who followed in Lugosi&#x27;s shoes in playing Dracula, and who achieved significant fame in that role, had different attitudes to Lugosi&#x27;s portrayal.

Christopher Lee, who played Dracula in a series of Hammer movies, said: &quot;Anyhow, about the Lugosi Dracula. I was so disappointed. I absolutely had been wanting to see it for a long, long time. There are aspects of it, for instance, that I considered ridiculous. Dracula is played too nice at the beginning. Practically no menace in the character .. There is no shock or fright in it. Lugosi&#x27;s hands too ... He held them out stiffly... making him look like a puppet. His smile was not always sinister, either&quot;. While thinking that Lugosi was in his younger days a wonderful looking man, who had tremendous presence and personality, Lee also thought that Lugosi &quot;was not the right man to play Dracula from the point of view of nationality. Because Transylvania is in Romania and he was a Hungarian from the town of Lugos, hence his name&quot;. At the time that Bram Stoker wrote the novel, however, Transylvania was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. In addition to this, Lugoj, the town from which Lugosi came, is located in what can be considered Transylvania.

Gary Oldman, who played Dracula in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s adaptation, considered Lugosi to be his favorite Dracula and said about his performance: &quot;He was really on to something: the way he moved, the way he sounded&quot;. Oldman based his Dracula voice on Lugosi&#x27;s voice.

===Posters===
The film&#x27;s poster campaign was overseen by Universal advertising art director Karoly Grosz, who also illustrated the &quot;insert&quot; poster himself. Original posters from the 1931 release are scarce and highly valuable to collectors. In 2009, actor Nicolas Cage auctioned off his collection of vintage film posters, which included an original &quot;StyleF&quot; one sheet that sold for $310,700; as of March 2012, it stood as the sixth-highest price for a film poster. In summer 2017, Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett loaned his rare &quot;StyleC&quot; poster to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts for an exhibition on horror film posters. In December that same year, an extremely rare &quot;StyleA&quot; poster—one of only two known copies—sold at auction for $525,000, setting a new world record for the most expensive film poster.

After the film&#x27;s original theatrical run, several theatrical reissues were promoted with new poster designs.

===Iconography===
This film, and the 1920s stage play by Deane and Balderston, contributed much of Dracula&#x27;s popular iconography, much of which vastly differs from Stoker&#x27;s novel. In the novel and in the German silent film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), Dracula&#x27;s appearance is repulsive; Lugosi portrays the Count as a handsome, charming nobleman. The Deane-Balderston play and this film also introduced the now iconic images of Dracula entering his victims&#x27; bedrooms through French doors/windows, wrapping his satin-lined cape around victims, and more emphasis on Dracula transforming into a bat. In the Stoker novel, he variously transformed into a bat or a wolf, a mist or &quot;elemental dust&quot;.

The now classic Dracula line, &quot;I never drink ... wine&quot;, is original to this film. It did not appear in Stoker&#x27;s novel or the original production of the play. When the play was revived on Broadway in 1977 starring Frank Langella, the line was added to the script.

Dracula&#x27;s property at Purfleet is simply called Carfax in the novel; the film renames it Carfax Abbey.

==Home media==
Between the 1960s and 1970s, Castle Films released an abridged version of &quot;Dracula&quot; on 8 mm film. In the 1980s, MCA Home Video released &quot;Dracula&quot; on Betamax, VHS, and Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED). In the 1990s, MCA/Universal Home Video released &quot;Dracula&quot; on VHS as part of the &quot;Universal Monsters Classic Collection&quot;, a series of releases of Universal Classic Monsters films.

<text>Game On is a British sitcom which ran for three series on BBC2 from 27 February 1995 to 6 February 1998.

The central characters are three childhood friends from Herne Bay in Kent: laddish agoraphobe Matthew Malone (Ben Chaplin in the first series and Neil Stuke in the second and third), man-eater Amanda &quot;Mandy&quot; Wilkins (Samantha Janus), and wimpish Martin Henson (Matthew Cottle). In their twenties, the trio move into and share a flat in Battersea, south-west London, which Matthew bought with his inheritance, and the series follows their lives as flatmates.

Created and written by Andrew Davies and Bernadette Davis, and produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC, &quot;Game On&quot; was aimed at twenty-somethings, the same age group as the principal cast of the show.

==Production==
It was directed by John Stroud, produced by Sioned Wiliam and the BBC Television Head of Comedy Geoffrey Perkins, and executive produced by Denise O&#x27;Donohue on behalf of Hat Trick Productions for the BBC.

After a successful first series, Ben Chaplin left the cast unexpectedly after receiving an offer of a film role in Hollywood on the back of his performance in the series. He was replaced for series 2 and 3 by Neil Stuke. (The change of actor was indirectly acknowledged in Stuke&#x27;s first episode, when the other characters complained about the recasting of a main character in &quot;Roseanne&quot; and expressed their dislike for TV shows which did this). The first two series were written by Andrew Davies and Bernadette Davis, while Davis wrote the final series alone.

The show&#x27;s theme tune was &quot;Where I Find My Heaven&quot; by the Gigolo Aunts. The single reached number 29 in the UK singles chart in May 1995, when the series debuted. Among other music included was &quot;Dogs of Lust&quot; by The The, &quot;Nowhere&quot; by Therapy?, &quot;From Despair to Where&quot; by Manic Street Preachers, &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; by Blur, &quot;God! Show Me Magic&quot; by Super Furry Animals, &quot;The View From Here&quot; by Dubstar and Oasis.

A fourth series was considered. Bernadette Davis voiced her desire to focus the next series on the development of Matthew, who due to his flat-bound existence, she began to find increasingly hard to write for; the addition of a &quot;radicalist&quot; new gay or lesbian housemate was also part of her suggestions to add a new element of interest to the series. However, despite a continuity announcer stating over the closing credits of the final episode in a 1999 repeat that the series would return the following year, only one further repeated episode was broadcast the following year, and a fourth series never emerged.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
&quot;The Digital Fix&quot; noted that viewing figures for the show were highest during its first series with Ben Chaplin as the lead actor, and the audience for the subsequent series declined sharply when he was replaced by Neil Stuke. &quot;The British Comedy Guide&quot; noted in its review of &quot;Game On&quot; that the series was polarizing due to some controversy over some of the politically incorrect dialogue, situations and gags, but also that the series had high viewing figures, building up an even bigger following after its cancellation.

===Awards===
&quot;Game On&quot; was nominated for Best Comedy (Programme or Series) at the 1997 BAFTAs, along with &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;Father Ted&quot;; the category was won by &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;.

==DVD releases==
All three series of the show are available on DVD. The first series DVD is the only one with any special features, which include Chaplin&#x27;s best moments as Matthew Malone from the first series and character photo galleries.

<doc id="1046581" wikidata="Q7487968" url="?curid=1046581" title="Shane Atkinson">
<text>Shane Atkinson, of Christchurch, New Zealand was a major spammer whose details were leaked onto the Internet soon after an article was written about him in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot;. After he was exposed as a spammer in 2003, Shane Atkinson found himself at the receiving end of a barrage of public outrage and proclaimed that he would give up spamming.

Atkinson was tracked down by anti-spam collaborators on the Usenet news.net-admin newsgroups. Before being identified, Atkinson&#x27;s operation would send up to 100 million messages on a &quot;good day,&quot; advertising for penis-enlargement pills. The actual spamming was done by a 15-year-old boy in the United States, who earned US$500 a day doing so. His web sites were hosted on Polish and Pakistani network providers.

His brother Lance has also become well-known and was ordered to pay US$2 million to the United States authorities for his spamming operations in March 2005.

An investigation by the BBC broadcast in December 2007 and January 2008 found Atkinson was still active in spamming. Atkinson&#x27;s Internet service provider was contacted and explained that he was not sending it from his own account but hiding behind a number of other slave or zombie computers, making identification difficult. Simon Cox of the BBC phoned Atkinson in late 2007 and after confirming his identity told him that there were serious allegations about him. He denied them. His reply was 

Cox put it to him that he was still controlling a network of computers and that he had been sending out spam.

Atkinson replied 

Following on Cox&#x27;s investigation, New Zealand police at the end of 2007 raided four properties in Christchurch and seized 22 computers. They interviewed two men about illegal spamming and in October 2008 the Department of Internal Affairs asked the High Court to impose penalties of NZ$200,000 each for breaching the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act

On Monday, 22 December 2008 Lance Atkinson was fined NZ$100,000 after the Department of Internal Affairs laid charges under the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act. It is understood Atkinson settled out of court. In summing up the judge conceded that the offending started before the act came into force and Atkinson had co-operated with the authorities. Lance now has the dubious honour of being the first person to be fined under the new act. Shane Atkinson and Roland Smits have elected to defend the changes currently before the courts.

<doc id="1046587" wikidata="Q7253030" url="?curid=1046587" title="Pruneyard Shopping Center">
<text>The Pruneyard Shopping Center is a open-air shopping center located in Campbell, California, at the intersection of Campbell Avenue and Bascom Avenue, just east of State Route 17. It was built in the 1960s as the PruneYard Shopping Center. It includes shops, a DoubleTree by Hilton inn, a movie theater originally built in 1964, and three office towers built in 1970, one of which is the tallest building in the area outside of downtown San Jose.

==History==
Fred Sahadi developed the PruneYard Shopping Center as part of a mixed-use development on the site of the Brynteson Ranch, which he bought in 1968. It was completed in 1970, designed to be an upscale shopping center. In 2014 Ellis Partners and Fortress Investment Group LLC bought it from Equity Office.

A major renovation and expansion began in 2017. The movie theater, the first business to open in the mall in 1969 as the three-screen United Artists Movie Theater, was renovated at the turn of the 21st century and became Camera 7; it closed in April 2017 and reopened in April 2018 as the Pruneyard Cinemas, with cocktails delivered to patrons&#x27; seats and the Cedar Room restaurant in the former location of Boswell&#x27;s, a 1970s fern bar.

The Pruneyard was bought by Regency Centers in 2019. There are plans to add another office building and more retail.

===&quot;Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins&quot;===
In the late 1970s, the mall was involved in a free speech dispute with local high school students that was ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 9, 1980. The Pruneyard case established two important rules in American constitutional law:

* Under the California Constitution, individuals may peacefully exercise their right to free speech in parts of &quot;private&quot; shopping centers regularly held open to the public, subject to reasonable regulations adopted by the shopping centers.
* Under the U.S. Constitution, states can provide their citizens with broader rights in their constitutions than under the federal Constitution, so long as those rights do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights.

<doc id="1046589" wikidata="Q633155" url="?curid=1046589" title="Marvin Santiago">
<text>Marvin Santiago (December 26, 1947 – October 6, 2004) was a Puerto Rican salsa singer who became famous all across Latin America during the 1970s. He was also a part-time comedian on Puerto Rican television.

== Early life ==

Santiago was born in the Santurce district of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In his younger years Santiago lived between the Bolívar and Sánchez streets in the Parada 22 area of Santurce. At the age of 13, Santiago and his family moved to the Nemesio Canales public housing project where he was eventually nicknamed &quot;El Grifo de Canales&quot; (&quot;The kinky-haired of Canales&quot;) by close friends and fans. Santiago was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a young age.

During his youth, Santiago would participate in jam sessions in his neighborhood as well as in school. His first professional job as a singer was in 1966 with Roberto Valdés group &quot;Los Trotamundos&quot;.

== Recording career ==

=== Rafael Cortijo ===

Upon a recommendation from conga player Celso Clemente, famed Puerto Rican composer Tite Curet Alonso met Santiago and brought him to an audition for Rafael Cortijo&#x27;s group. Santiago was hired to sing with Cortijo&#x27;s group and in three weeks time learned the bands repertoire and started touring with them throughout Dominican Republic, New York City and Chicago. On an impulse, Santiago decided to stay in Chicago. During breaks from Cortijo&#x27;s group, Santiago played with local bands &quot;Gilberto Y Su Sexteto&quot; &amp; &quot;La Sonora De Felipe Rodríguez&quot;.

Santiago&#x27;s first recorded tracks appeared on Rafael Cortijo Y Su Bonche&#x27;s album &quot;Ahí Na Má! Put It There&quot;, released in 1968. Two of the tracks recorded where Santiago provided lead vocals, &quot;Vasos En Colores&quot; and &quot;La Campana Del Lechón&quot;, were later recorded by Santiago as a solo artist. Santiago provided background vocals on other tracks from the album.

=== Roberto Angleró ===

In 1969 Santiago left Chicago and returned to Puerto Rico where he joined Johnny &quot;El Bravo&quot; López&#x27;s group and toured with them briefly. On one engagement with López in Coamo, Puerto Rico, Santiago met Roberto Angleró and offered his services as a backup singer if he ever needed one. Soon after that meeting, Angleró needed a background singer and called López to see if he could lend Santiago to do some background vocals for his group and López told Angleró &quot;you can keep him if you want to&quot;. Santiago joined Angleró&#x27;s group and in 1970 recorded an album with them. The album had a minor hit with the track &quot;Chán Con Chán&quot;. The track &quot;Salao&quot; from the album was later recorded as &quot;Safa Diablo&quot; by Bobby Valentín&#x27;s group with Santiago on lead vocals. Another track from the album, &quot;El Pantalón&quot;, was later recorded as &quot;El Filo Del Pantalón&quot; by Santiago as a solo artist.

=== Bobby Valentín ===

Late in 1970 Bobby Valentín, another type 1 diabetic, hired Santiago as the lead singer of his band after Frankie Hernández left his group. Valentin was one of the original members of the Fania All-Stars, an exclusive Salsa conglomerate of Fania Records musicians that showcased other performers such as Celia Cruz, Rubén Blades, Hector Lavoe, Roberto Roena and many others. Santiago would become an impromptu member of the group, and later a member in his own right.

Santiago&#x27;s first recording with Valentin&#x27;s group was the album &quot;Rompecabezas&quot;, released in 1971. The songs &quot;Amolador&quot;, &quot;Beso Borracho&quot;, &quot;Papel De Payaso&quot; &amp; &quot;Vete Pa&#x27; llá&quot; were big hits from that album.

Santiago&#x27;s second recording with Valentin&#x27;s group was the album &quot;Soy Boricua&quot;, released in 1972. Many considered the album a classic and the title track, written by Roberto Angleró, an informal patriotic anthem for Puerto Ricans. The album&#x27;s title song, and the Curet Alonso written &quot;Pirata De La Mar&quot;, became major international hits.

Santiago was part of the band when Valentín played a concert at the Río Piedras State Penitentiary. The concert was recorded and released as two separate albums in 1975.&quot;&quot;Préstame Tu Caballo&quot; &amp; &quot;Dos Soneros&quot; were the most popular tracks performed by Santiago on the recording.

On Valentín&#x27;s 1976 album, &quot;Afuera&quot;, Santiago had a few hits. Among them &quot;Son Son Chararí&quot; (Written by Angleró) and &quot;El Jíbaro Y La Naturaleza&quot;. The latter a nostalgia/protest song with environmental overtones, which featured Fania All-Stars member Barry Rogers in a trombone solo. Valentín was forced to drop Santiago off his band due to Santiago&#x27;s drug addiction at the time.

=== Puerto Rico All Stars ===

Late in 1976, Santiago provided background vocals and was the lead singer for the track &quot;Los Tambores&quot; on Puerto Rico All Stars self-titled first album. Puerto Rico All Stars featured Puerto Rican musicians exclusively and was a rival to NY based Fania All-Stars.

=== Solo Artist ===

In 1977 Santiago recorded and released his first solo album &quot;De Los Soneros&quot;. Tito Valentín and Wito Morales produced the album. The recording had the hits &quot;Al Revés&quot; &amp; &quot;De Los Soneros&quot;.

After that album, Santiago joined Tommy Olivencia&#x27;s group for about a year and recorded tracks destined to appear on Olivencia&#x27;s album &quot;&quot;Sweat Trumpet Hot &quot;Salsa&quot;&quot;&quot;. During the recording sessions Olivencia found out that Santiago was still under contract with his previous label and had Simón Pérez re–record Santiago&#x27;s vocals. Three tracks from those sessions with Santiago&#x27;s vocals, &quot;Que Dichoso Es&quot;, &quot;La Pela&quot; &amp; &quot;Del Montón&quot;, later appeared on Santiago&#x27;s compilation &quot;15 Éxitos De Marvin Santiago&quot; released by TH Records in 1984.

Famous arranger and producer Jorge Millet knew Santiago well and their friendship could be traced back to the late 1960s when they met while both lived in the city of Chicago. Millet was aware of Santiago&#x27;s potential and as a friend wanted to lend him a helping hand by giving him the opportunity to record as a solo artist. As producer and talent scout for TH Records, Millet was able to provide the arrangements, musicians and artwork for Santiago&#x27;s debut album with the label. The album, &quot;Fuego A La Jicotea&quot;, was released in 1979. The album was very successful and considered a classic for many music fans. The album&#x27;s title track, written by Cortijo, was a major hit in Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The song was a thinly-veiled ode to marijuana. Santiago&#x27;s remake of a song from his days in Cortijo, &quot;Vasos En Colores&quot;, was also a major hit from the album and remained in his live repertoire throughout his career. Other hits from the album were &quot;La Picúa&quot;, a veiled homage to the female anatomy, and &quot;El Mangoneo&quot; (a &quot;Mozambique&quot; very much in the style of Cortijo&#x27;s &quot;Sorongo&quot;).

Santiago&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Caliente Y Explosivo&quot;, released in 1980, was another success. It also had Millet as arranger, piano player and musical director. Millet also designed the cover art for this album. The album contained the hits &quot;Al Son De La Lata Baila El Chorizo&quot; (Originally played by Ismael Rivera when he was part of Cortijo Y Su Combo), &quot;El Tiburón De Agua Dulce&quot; (Written by Millet and the longest studio track Santiago ever recorded at just over seven minutes with an amazing piano solo by Millet), &quot;La Buruquena De Doña Inés&quot; &amp; &quot;Esta Noche Sale El Lobo&quot;.

Many of the songs in Santiago&#x27;s solo albums were fast-paced, full of intensity and laden with humor and double entendres. Santiago was a master improviser that used &quot;soneos&quot; (rhyming verses common to Salsa music) with a strong sense of alliteration, consonance and rhythm that was described once by Rubén Blades this way: &quot;(Rhythm-wise) Marvin is capable of fitting a Mack truck into a parking space where a Volkswagen Beetle won&#x27;t fit.&quot; He also used strong Puerto Rican figures of speech and slang that eventually granted him the moniker of &quot;El Sonero del Pueblo&quot;.

== Drug Arrest And Sentence ==

In 1980, at the height of his popularity, Santiago was arrested and imprisoned for cocaine possession. He served in prison a little over five out of the ten years he was sentenced due to good behavior. Ruben Blades visited Santiago while in prison something for which Santiago was eternally grateful to Blades.

Shortly after he entered prison, Santiago became a born-again Christian and stopped using drugs. As part of his rehabilitation program, Santiago became the director of a group of prisoners that dedicated their efforts towards drug prevention awareness programs (Confinados En Acción Y Prevención). Santiago went to universities and public schools to give talks about drug prevention.

In July 1981 Millet died from a massive heart attack. Santiago was allowed a prison pass to attend the funeral home where Millet&#x27;s body rested and pay respects to his friend.

In late 1981, Santiago released the album &quot;Adentro&quot; (&quot;Inside&quot;). The title of the album referred to the fact that Santiago was in prison. The album was recorded live at the Bayamón regional jail and the vocals were later overdubbed in a makeshift studio at the jail. A minor hit from the album was &quot;Auditorio Azul&quot; (Based on the fact that prison uniforms at that facility were blue in color).

In 1982, Santiago was invited and participated on the Third Penitentiary Theater Festival held in Venezuela.

Santiago recorded three more studio albums while serving his sentence. The albums were not received as well as previous albums due to a combination of factors. Among those factors were; arrangements that were not at the same level as the ones provided by Millet produced albums, Santiago&#x27;s spiritual reawakening and the considerably cleaned up lyrics on his later work, something that his hardcore fans did not approve of, and the surge of merengue groups such as the Puerto Rico-based Conjunto Quisqueya and Freddie Kenton Orchestra, as well as new local talent such as Eddie Santiago, Gilberto Santa Rosa, and Frankie Ruiz who popularized the so-called &quot;Romantic Salsa&quot;, which eventually displaced more urban-based subject matter in Salsa songs.

== Later life ==

Santiago played several shows outside prison while he served his sentence. Santiago earned over $100,000 from those presentations. By the time he left prison, the bank account holding the earnings of his presentations while in prison had about $2,500 left. Shortly after Santiago found out, he divorced his wife.

Even though Santiago&#x27;s fame waned a bit by the time he finished his prison sentence, he was able to keep a busy schedule by touring in Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries.

Santiago also appeared on Puerto Rican TV several times, often as a comedian in Luisito Vigoreaux&#x27;s produced TV shows.

Santiago rejoined Valentín in 1991 to record new versions of old songs he did with Valentín for a CD commemorating Valentín&#x27;s 25th anniversary in the music business. Santiago also participated on a concert celebrating Valentín&#x27;s 25th anniversary, later released on DVD.

Santiago last studio album with Valentín, &quot;Donde Lo Dejamos&quot;, was released in 1992. By this release it was noticeable that Santiago&#x27;s voice was starting to fade and becoming hoarse and raspy due to poor vocal coaching.

In 1999, the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico had a tribute at the Capitol Building to honor Santiago&#x27;s musical career.

In 2000, Santiago participated on the theater play &quot;El Hospitalillo&quot; at the Carmen Delia Dipiní Theater gathering critical acclaim. 
In August 2000, Santiago participated in Tommy Olivencia&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebration as a bandleader at the Tito Puente amphitheater, in San Juan, P.R. The concert was recorded and released on CD the following year.

In July 2001, a few of his musical colleagues organized a tribute concert to Santiago. The concert was held at the Tito Puente amphitheater and some of the performers sharing the stage with Santiago were Vitín Avilés, Carlos &quot;Cano&quot; Estremera, Meñique, Guillo Rivera &amp; Luigi Texidor

In 2002 Santiago joined the all-star roster of singers and musicians that took part of Bobby Valentin&#x27;s 35th anniversary live concert held at the Río Piedras State Penitentiary. Among the all-star lineup were Rubén Blades, Cheo Feliciano, Pedro Guzmán, Giovanni Hidalgo, Papo Lucca, Roberto Roena &amp; Luigi Texidor. The concert was filmed and released on DVD.

For a few years until early 2003, Santiago shared a popular radio program every Saturday night with JC &quot;El Babalao&quot; Cordero. The program, &quot;Salsa Gorda&quot;, featured Salsa music from the 1970s and 1980s.

In March 2004 a tribute concert was held at the Tito Puente amphitheater, in San Juan, P.R. by several musicians to celebrate Santiago&#x27;s musical career. Among the performers were Luisito Carrión, Oscar D&#x27;León, Elías Lopes, Andy Montañez, Luis &quot;Perico&quot; Ortíz &amp; Domingo Quiñones. The concert was filmed and released on CD and DVD.

In May 2004 Santiago was part of the singers and musical colleagues that participated on a tribute concert dedicated to the 45th anniversary of Tommy Olivencia musical career.

Santiago, who adopted Marvin Hagler&#x27;s &quot;Marvelous&quot; nickname (both because of their common first name and the fact that, at one time, his head was shaved bald like Hagler&#x27;s), had begun conversations to join a Fania All-Stars comeback as a tribute to Celia Cruz by the summer of 2004, but then, he became severely ill.

== Death ==

Santiago&#x27;s diabetes started taking a toll on his health during the 1990s. In October 1996 Santiago had his right leg amputated after having three toes amputated in three separate occasions a few months earlier. He also started having problems with his sight. In November 2002 Santiago suffered two heart attacks followed by a major kidney failure in February 2003. After the kidney failure incident, Santiago had to undergo dialysis treatment. Santiago&#x27;s name was placed on a waiting list for a kidney transplant but was not able to get a donor. Santiago lost vision from one eye and suffered severe kidney, heart and liver damage on the weeks prior to his death. On the afternoon of October 6, 2004 after many years of health issues, Santiago died at the age of 56 at the San Pablo Hospital in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. His funeral was well attended by the public and music friends, with his brother Billyván playing a Plena tribute to Marvin. He was buried at Lomas Verdes Cemetery in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

== Legacy ==

In the Villa Palmeras neighborhood in Santurce, there is a square named &quot;Plaza De Los Salseros&quot; honoring the memory of distinguished Salsa music luminaries. In December 2009, a bust (Sculpture) of Santiago and a plaque were added to honor his music legacy. His daughter, Roseann Santiago traveled from Chicago to attend the reveal of his sculpture. Other artists honored in the square are Rafael Cortijo, Héctor Lavoe, Tommy Olivencia, Tito Puente, Ismael Rivera and Pellín Rodríguez.

Santiago left a legacy of songs still heard and popular phrases still in current use in Puerto Rico. One phrase was an affirmation: &quot;¡O-fi-cial!&quot;. Another was a stream of references to Puerto Rican towns: &quot;¡Baya-móntate, Barran-quítate, Vega Bájate, Ad-júntate!&quot;, roughly translated to &quot;get on, get out of the way, get down, get together!&quot;, mentioned along the names of Bayamón, Barranquitas, Vega Baja and Adjuntas. A third one was: &quot;¡Linda Melodía!&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Melody!&quot;), which he uttered when a musical arrangement was particularly complex or remarkable.

He also used code phrases to refer to drugs: &quot;¡Guayacol, con uña rallá!&quot; was his code phrase for cocaine, and &quot;¡Acetileno!&quot; his reference for heroin. After his religious conversion, however, Marvin affirmed that the only substance in his life from that moment on, besides the insulin he needed daily for his diabetes, was &quot;Cristomicina&quot;, a portmanteau of the name of Christ and erythromycin.

<doc id="1046591" wikidata="Q206165" url="?curid=1046591" title="Thonon-les-Bains">
<text>Thonon-les-Bains (; ), often simply referred to as Thonon, is a subprefecture of the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Eastern France. In 2018, the commune had a population of 35,241. Thonon-les-Bains is part of a transborder metropolitan area known as Grand Genève. It is situated on the shores of Lake Geneva (, or simply ).

==History==

Thonon-les-Bains was the historic capital of Chablais, a province of the old Duchy of Savoy. The Chablais Savoyard is the portion of Chablais in France. Chablais Valaisan and Chablais Vaudois are those portions of Chablais in the adjacent Switzerland cantons Valais and Vaud.(cite: Chablais Wikipedia) The town was the capital of the Dukedom of Chablais.

During the debates on the future of the Duchy of Savoy in 1860, the population was sensitive to the idea of a union of the northern part of the duchy with Switzerland. A petition circulated in this part of the country (Chablais, Faucigny, Northern Genevois), but it collected no more than 13,600 signatures. The duchy was reunited after a plebiscite organised on 22 and 23 April 1860 under Napoleon III, in which 99.8 percent of the Savoyards voting were reported to have answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question &quot;Does Savoy want to be reunited to France?&quot;

All participants have to have a Hong Kong ID or be born in Hong Kong (with a valid birth certificate). The age requirement is 17–27 as of 2011, though the upper age was previously up to 25. While there has been other Miss Hong Kong pageants in prior years producing notable titleholders such as Judy Dan (1952), Virginia June Lee (1954), Michelle Mok (1958), Laura da Costa (1967), Mabel Hawkett (1970) and Shirley Yu (1974, contest organized by Miss Pearl of the Orient Company and overlapping with TVB&#x27;s), the current annual TVB pageant began in 1973. Apart from the top prize winner, first runner-up and second runner-up prizes, the pageant also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Many Miss Hong Kong contestants have gone on to have movie careers as it is quite typical for the top contestants to garner television contracts from TVB.

* Overseas Recruitment: Applications are available in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, any TVB rental store in the US, Fairchild TV station, Ontario, Richmond, British Columbia, and any TVB rental store in Canada. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. TVB, organisers of the pageant travel to cities in the US and Canada. They include: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. TVB would choose a certain amount of delegates to interview and would call them to interview. Besides personal interviews, delegates have to wear swimsuits chosen by themselves and walk around in it. Delegates are chosen and return to Hong Kong in late May to compete.
* Local Recruitment: Hong Kong. Applications are available in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, and Europe. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. Weeks later, primary and secondary interviews are conducted. Top interviewed finalists are chosen and they record a reality TV show (like 2006) to choose the deserving semifinalists to compete. They joined the overseas delegates to form the top event finalists.

The pageant is traditionally televised into two events, although this is not always necessarily the case in recent years. First, a preliminary event is held where 12 finalists are selected from a group of candidates, the number of which is usually around 20–25 (with 30 being the maximum). Then a final event is held, culminating in the announcement of the winner and the first and second runners-up from the 12 finalists. In some years, the field is narrowed down to a final five, from which the runners-up and winner are chosen. Often several contestants dropped out of the pageant before the televised preliminary, thus there would be a candidate with #30 assigned to her, but only 25 or so contestants.

==Overseas contestant awards list==

Starting from 1991, the Miss Hong Kong pageant greets delegates from overseas. They include Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco. Local contestants coming from Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, London, and more enter at Hong Kong. The overseas delegates wait for the notification of their regional sponsors of TVB and if they are chosen, they fly to Hong Kong to compete.

Notice that Vancouver has the most Miss Hong Kong winners from the overseas. They had a record of four consecutive winners from 1997 to 2000, and three consecutive winners from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, the top 3 delegates were all from Vancouver. Even though the 2007 pageant had the top 3 all from the US and Canada but Grace Wong and Lorretta Chow travelled to Hong Kong to compete in the pageant, so they are recognised by TVB to be local delegates not overseas delegates. They did however come from the overseas.

==Hong Kong beauty queens at Grand slam beauty pageants==
=== Miss Universe Hong Kong ===
* In 2001, TVB lost the franchise for Miss Universe.
* Beginning in 2024, Hong Kong was allowed to compete in Miss Universe after many years of being disallowed by MUO, due to area status, &quot;SAR of China&quot;.

=== Miss World Hong Kong ===

<text>Great king, and the equivalent in many languages, refers to historical titles of certain monarchs, suggesting an elevated status among the host of kings and princes. 

==History==
The title is most usually associated with the &quot;shahanshah&quot; (shah of shahs, i.e., king of kings, indeed translated from Greek as &quot;basileus tōn basileōn&quot;, later adopted by the Byzantine emperors) of Persia under the Achaemenid dynasty whose vast empire in Asia lasted for 200 years up to the year 330 BC, which was later adopted by successors of the Achaemenid Empire whose monarchial names were also succeeded by &quot;the great.&quot; In comparison, &quot;high king&quot; was used by ancient rulers in Great Britain, Ireland, and Greece.

In the 2nd millennium BC Near East, there was a tradition of reciprocally using such addresses between powers to recognize each other as equal diplomatically. Only the kings of countries who were not subject to any other king and were powerful enough to draw the respect of their adversaries were allowed to use the title of &quot;great king.&quot; Those were the kings of Egypt, Yamhad, Hatti, Babylonia, Mitanni (until its demise in the 14th century), Assyria (only after the demise of Mitanni), and for a brief time, the Myceneans. Great kings referred to each other as brothers and often established close relationships through marriages and frequent gift exchanges. Letters exchanged between these rulers, several of which have been recovered, especially in Amarna and Hittite archives, provide details of this diplomacy.

The case of the &quot;maharaja&quot; (&quot;great &quot;raja,&quot;&quot; the great king and prince, in Sanskrit and Hindi) on the Indian subcontinent, initially reserved for the regional hegemon such as the Gupta, is an example of how such a lofty style can get caught in a cycle of devaluation by &quot;title inflation&quot; as ever more, mostly less powerful rulers adopt the style. This is often followed by the emergence of one or more new, more exclusive and prestigious styles, as, in this case, &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot; (king of great kings&quot;). The Turkic-Mongol title &quot;khan&quot; also came to be &quot;augmented&quot; to tiles like &quot;khagan&quot;, &quot;chagan&quot; or &quot;hakan&quot;, meaning &quot;khan of khans,&quot; i.e., equivalent to the king of kings.

The aforementioned Indian style &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot; is also an example of an alternative semantic title for similar &quot;higher&quot; royal styles such as &quot;King of Kings&quot;. Alternatively, a more idiomatic style may develop into an equally prestigious tradition of titles because of the shining example of the original. Thus, various styles of emperors trace back to the Roman &quot;imperator&quot; (strictly speaking a republican military honorific) or the family surname Caesar (turned into an imperial title since Diocletian&#x27;s tetrarchy).

As the conventional use of the &quot;king&quot; and its equivalents to render various other monarchical styles illustrates, there are many roughly equivalent styles, each of which may spawn a &quot;great &quot;X&quot;&quot; variant, either unique or becoming a rank in a corresponding tradition; in this context, &quot;grand&quot; is equivalent to &quot;great&quot; and sometimes interchangeable if the convention does not firmly prescribe one of the two. Examples include the Grand Duke and German &quot;Grosswojwod&quot;.

==Examples==
*Antiochus III the Great, a Hellenistic Greek king and the sixth ruler of the Seleucid Empire, was known as &quot;Basileus Megas.&quot;
*Eucratides I the Great, a Hellenistic king of Bactria, was called &quot;Basileus Megas&quot; on his coins.
*Mithridates I the Great, a Parthian king, was called &quot;Basileus Megas&quot; on his silver coins.
*Menander I Soter, a Hellenistic king of India, was referred to as &quot;Maharaja Menadra&quot;, (&quot;Great King Menander&quot;) in Pali language.
*In medieval Serbia, Stefan the First-Crowned, likely Stefan Uroš I, Stefan Dečanski and Stefan Dušan had the title of &quot;great king&quot; (Велики краљ, &quot;Veliki kralj&quot;)

<text>Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann (née Kleemann, born 7 September 1966) is a German former speed skater. She is a three-time Olympic gold medallist, winning the 3000 metres in 1992 and 1998 and the 5000 metres in 1992. She won a total of eight Olympic medals.

==Personal life==
Born as Gunda Kleemann in Sondershausen, Bezirk Erfurt, East Germany, she has lived in Erfurt for most of her life. Before German reunification in 1990, she skated for East Germany.

She changed her name to Gunda Niemann after her marriage in 1991 to judoka Detlev Niemann. After their divorce in 1995, she kept the name Niemann. She changed her name to Niemann-Stirnemann after marrying her Swiss long-time manager, Oliver Stirnemann, on 11 July 1997. Their daughter is also a competitive speed skater.

The speed skating oval in Erfurt, the Gunda-Niemann-Stirnemann-Halle, was named after her.

==Career==
Niemann-Stirnemann dominated women&#x27;s speed skating for several years, especially on the longer distances. She has competed in four Olympics, from 1988 to 1998, and won eight Olympic medals (3 gold, 4 silver, and 1 bronze). In the nine years from 1991 to 1999, she won the World Allround Championships every year except 1994.

Niemann-Stirnemann left speed skating in 2001 to give birth to a daughter, but later returned to competition. She planned to make one last comeback and participate in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, but a lingering back injury – which she suffered from since the 2004–05 season – made her quit. At the end of October 2005, a few days before the German Championships, she announced her retirement.

Except for one day in March 1998, Niemann-Stirnemann was number one in the Adelskalender, the all-time allround speed skating ranking, from 24 January 1993, until 2 March 2001 – a total of 2,958 days. She skated in Olympic, World, World Cup, European and national championships to 215 medals, thereof 163 gold medals.

== World records ==
Over the course of her career, Niemann-Stirnemann skated 18 world records:

Note that the 10000 m was suspended as a world record event at the 1953 ISU Congress.

<doc id="1046640" wikidata="Q791350" url="?curid=1046640" title="Avraham Tehomi">
<text>Avraham Tehomi (, also Avraham T&#x27;homi, 1903–1990) was a militant who served as a Haganah commander, and was one of the founders and first commander of the Irgun. He is best known for the assassination of Jacob Israël de Haan.

==Biography==
Avraham Zilberg (later Tehomi) was born in Odessa in the Russian Empire. He immigrated to the Mandatory Palestine as a pioneer and started working in road construction. He became a member of the Haganah, completed his Haganah courses with honors, and served as a commander in Jerusalem. As a Haganah officer, he served under the leadership of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who would in 1952 become the second President of Israel.

==Pre-state underground==
On June 30, 1924, the Dutch Jewish poet, novelist and diplomat Jacob Israel de Haan, who was living in Jerusalem as a journalist, was shot and killed. Tehomi was allegedly responsible for the assassination. De Haan had come to Palestine as an ardent Zionist, but he had become increasingly critical of the Zionist organizations as he favored a negotiated solution to the struggle between Jews and Arabs. The murder shocked Palestine and Europe, and the British authorities offered a reward for information that would lead to the arrest of the assassin, but the killer was not caught. In an interview for Israeli television 60 years later, Tehomi confessed to killing de Haan to Israeli journalists Shlomo Nakdimon and Shaul Mayzlish. He openly stated: &quot;I have done what the Haganah decided had to be done. And nothing was done without the order of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. I have no regrets because he [de Haan] wanted to destroy our whole idea of Zionism.&quot;

In 1925, Tehomi was appointed deputy commander of the Jerusalem District Haganah and served as District Commander from 1929 to 1931.

The 1929 Palestine riots caused unrest in the Haganah ranks because the organization was not ready and did not respond appropriately to the Arab attacks. The disputes on this issue led to Tehomi&#x27;s departure from the Haganah, and the establishment, in 1931, of the Haganah Bet, a parallel Zionist organisation that would later become the Irgun, which was more prepared to use violence, and which Tehomi headed. That same year, he left Palestine for the United States on private business, but when he stopped over at Piraeus, his visa was canceled by the US consul for medical reasons, and he returned to Palestine. Tehomi later tried to reunite the two organizations and in 1937 returned to the Haganah in order to take up a senior position. However, approximately only half of the 3,000 fighters of the Irgun followed Tehomi back into the Haganah. The other half retained the Irgun as a separate fighting organization, engaging in conflict with both British and Arabs in Palestine. When the Haganah failed to fulfill its obligations under the amalgamation agreement, Tehomi resigned, and from then on allegedly engaged in independent illegal immigration activities and intelligence work. Several years later he retired from all activity.

==Later life==
In 1945, Tehomi immigrated to the United States with his wife, where they entered the international trade in precious stones. He remained there until 1968, when he returned to Israel and established a gem-polishing plant in Jerusalem. In the final years of his life, he lived in Hong Kong, where he died in 1990.

<text>Pico-Union is a neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California. The name &quot;Pico-Union&quot; refers to the neighborhood that surrounds the intersection of Pico Boulevard and Union Avenue. Located immediately west of Downtown Los Angeles, it is home to over 40,000 residents.

The neighborhood contains two historic districts, both listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

It has five public schools as well as a public library.

==Geography==

===Google Maps===
Google Maps draws the following boundaries for Pico-Union: Olympic Boulevard on the north, the Harbor Freeway on the east, the Santa Monica Freeway on the south and Hoover St. on the west.

===Mapping L.A. Project===

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Mapping L.A. project, Pico-Union is bounded by Olympic Boulevard on the north, the Harbor Freeway on the east, the Santa Monica Freeway on the south and Normandie Avenue on the west. It also includes the California Highway Patrol station beneath the Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial Interchange northeast of Washington Boulevard.

Pico-Union is flanked by Koreatown and Westlake to the north and northeast, Downtown to the east, Adams-Normandie, University Park and Exposition Park to the south and Harvard Heights to the west.

==History==

The Tongva village of Geveronga was located at the present-site of Pico-Union. It was destroyed in 1781 by Spanish settlers as part of the Anza Expedition who issued a claim to the land and water rights from King Carlos III.

The area was part of the early Pueblo de Los Ángeles settlement in Spanish and Mexican California.

The area encompassed by Pico-Union was developed as a middle and upper middle class residential district beginning in the 1910s. Easy access to downtown Los Angeles and the nearby Wilshire District drew large numbers of affluent homeowners. Following the Second World War, the Pico-Union area, like many inner city neighborhoods, experienced an outflux of residents to the suburbs. The loss of residents and business led to high vacancy rates and lower property values in much of the neighborhood by the 1960s.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, the area became a major point of entry for Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants seeking refuge from civil war, according to the &quot;Pico Union Self-Guided Walking Tour,&quot; published in 2009 by the Los Angeles Conservancy.

Pico-Union became the city&#x27;s 19th Historic Preservation Overlay Zone on August 10, 2004. It contains two historic districts listed in the National Register of Historic Places: South Bonnie Brae Tract Historic District and Alvarado Terrace Historic District.

In August 2012, the City of Los Angeles designated a portion of Vermont Avenue in Pico-Union as El Salvador Community Corridor; parts of Pico-Union are also being considered for designation as The Central American Historical District.

The former First Church of Christ, Scientist, once one of Jim Jones&#x27; Peoples Temples, was located in Pico-Union, at the corner of Alvarado Street and Alvarado Terrace.

==Population==

Pico-Union is the fourth-most-dense neighborhood in Los Angeles, surpassed only by East Hollywood, Westlake and Koreatown. The 2000 U.S. census counted 42,324 residents in the 1.67-square-miles neighborhood—an average of 25,352 people per square mile. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 44,664. The median age for residents was 27, considered young for the city and the county.

The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was Latinos, 85.4%; Asians, 7.6%; whites, 3.0%, blacks, 2.9%; and others, 1.1%. El Salvador (44.4%) and Mexico (23.3%) were the most common places of birth for the 64.6% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high in comparison with foreign-born in the city as a whole. Other immigrants come from Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $26,424, considered low for both the city and the county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large. The average household size of 3.3 people was relatively high for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 90.5% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest.

The percentages of never-married men (43.4%) and never-married women (36.2%) were among the county&#x27;s highest. The census found 2,113 families headed by single parents, the 23.3% rate being considered high for both the city and the county.

In 2000 there were 667 military veterans living in Pico-Union, or 2.3% of the population, considered a low rate for the city and the county overall.

==Education==

Pico-Union residents aged 25 and older holding a four-year degree amounted to 6.7% of the population in 2000, considered low for both the city and the county, and there was a high percentage of residents with less than a high school diploma.

<doc id="1046654" wikidata="Q1184825" url="?curid=1046654" title="PDTV">
<text>PDTV is an abbreviation short for &quot;Pure Digital Television&quot;. Often seen as part of the filename of TV shows shared through P2P, The Scene, and FTP servers on the Internet. In this case, PDTV refers not to container, bitrate or dimensions of the video, but the digital nature of the capture source. Non Scene European rippers often use the label DVBRip or &quot;DVB-rip&quot; to specify a purely digital rip of a Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), however all Scene groups use standardized labeling.

&quot;PDTV&quot; encompasses a broad array of capture methods and sources, but generally it involves the capture of SD or non-HD digital television broadcasts without any analog-to-digital conversion, instead relying on directly ripping MPEG streams. PDTV sources can be captured by a variety of digital TV tuner cards from a digital feed such as ClearQAM unencrypted cable, Digital Terrestrial Television, Digital Video Broadcast or other satellite sources. Just as with Freeview (DVB-T) in the United Kingdom, broadcast television in the United States has no barriers to PDTV capture. Hardware such as the HDHomeRun when connected to an ATSC (Antenna) or unencrypted ClearQAM cable feed allows lossless digital capture of MPEG-2 streams (Pure Digital Television), without monthly fees or other restrictions normally implemented by a Set-top box. Although different from the analog hole, Pure Digital Television capture imposes no technological restriction on what is done with the stream; playback, Mash-Ups and even recompression/pirated distribution are possible without the permission of the rights holder.

A publisher of fan-made DVD releases also uses the name PDTV, but with no connection to the more common usage explained above. The &quot;PD&quot; in this case refers to &quot;planet dust&quot; with an additional connotation of Public Domain, even though the material offered is more often the video equivalent of abandonware as opposed to anything where copyright has actually expired. Whereas PDTV content online (as described above) is indiscriminate in terms of copyright, physical DVD releases from PDTV only exist to supply fans with material not officially published to the DVD format.

As of 2018, the latter PDTV has undergone somewhat of a &quot;rebranding&quot;, shifting its focus slightly to further emphasize preservation of VHS, Beta and Laserdisc content. The meaning of the &quot;PD&quot; part of its name thus becoming more associated with &quot;physical disc&quot; rather than anything else.

<doc id="1046676" wikidata="Q7026429" url="?curid=1046676" title="Nicholas Wolterstorff">
<text>Nicholas Paul Wolterstorff (born January 21, 1932) is an American philosopher and theologian. He is currently Noah Porter Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology at Yale University. A prolific writer with wide-ranging philosophical and theological interests, he has written books on aesthetics, epistemology, political philosophy, philosophy of religion, metaphysics, and philosophy of education. In &quot;Faith and Rationality,&quot; Wolterstorff, Alvin Plantinga, and William Alston developed and expanded upon a view of religious epistemology that has come to be known as Reformed epistemology. He also helped to establish the journal &quot;Faith and Philosophy&quot; and the Society of Christian Philosophers.

== Biography ==
Wolterstorff was born on January 21, 1932, to Dutch emigrants in a small farming community in southwest Minnesota. After earning his BA in philosophy at Calvin University, Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1953, he entered Harvard University, where he earned his MA and PhD in philosophy, completing his studies in 1956. He then spent a year at the University of Cambridge, where he met C. D. Broad. From 1957 to 1959, he was an instructor in philosophy at Yale University. Then he took the post of Professor of Philosophy at Calvin College and taught for 30 years. He is now teaching at Yale as Noah Porter Professor Emeritus Philosophical Theology.

In 1987 Wolterstorff published &quot;Lament for a Son&quot; after the untimely death of his 25-year-old son Eric in a mountain climbing accident. In a series of short essays, Wolterstorff recounts how he drew on his Christian faith to cope with his grief. Wolterstorff explained that he published the book &quot;in the hope that it will be of help to some of those who find themselves with us in the company of mourners.&quot;

He has been a visiting professor at Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University, the University of Oxford, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Texas, the University of Michigan, Temple University, the Free University of Amsterdam (Vrije Universiteit), and the University of Virginia. In 2007, he received an honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He has been retired since June 2002.

Wolterstorff published his memoir with William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. in 2019, illustrating the close relationship between his personal life and his distinguished academic career.

== Personal life ==

Nicholas Wolterstorff lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with his wife Claire. He has four grown children. His oldest son died in a mountain climbing accident at age 25. He has seven grandchildren.

== Thought ==

While an undergraduate at Calvin College, Wolterstorff was greatly influenced by professors William Harry Jellema, Henry Stob, and Henry Zylstra, who introduced him to schools of thought that have dominated his mature thinking: Reformed theology and common sense philosophy. (These have also influenced the thinking of his friend and colleague Alvin Plantinga, another alumnus of Calvin College).

Wolterstorff builds upon the ideas of the Scottish common-sense philosopher Thomas Reid, who approached knowledge &quot;from the bottom-up&quot;. Instead of reasoning about transcendental conditions of knowledge, Wolterstorff suggests that knowledge and our knowing faculties are not the subject of our research but have to be seen as its starting point. He rejects classical foundationalism and instead sees knowledge as based upon insights in reality which are direct and indubitable. In &quot;Justice in Love,&quot; he rejects fundamentist notions of Christianity that hold to the necessity of the penal substitutionary atonement and justification by faith alone.

<text>Ruvuma Region (&quot;Mkoa wa Ruvuma&quot; in Swahili) is one of Tanzania&#x27;s 31 administrative regions. The region covers a land area of , comparable in size to the nation state of Latvia. The region is also bordered to the north by the Morogoro Region, to the northeast by the Lindi Region, to the east by the Mtwara Region,the west by Lake Nyasa with Malawi and to the northwest by the Njombe Region. The regional capital is the municipality of Songea.

According to the 2012 national census, the region had a population of 1,376,891, which was lower than the pre-census projection of 1,449,830. For 2002–2012, the region&#x27;s 2.1 percent average annual population growth rate was the twentieth highest in the country. It was also the 28th most densely populated region with .

==Etymology==
The region is named after the Ruvuma River, the second longest river in Tanzania, which forms most of its southern boundary with Niassa province of Mozambique (where it is known as &quot;Rovuma&quot;). 
==Geography==
Ruvuma Region is located in the Southern Highlands, which range between 300 and 2000 meters above sea level. Lake Nyasa, which is located in the Western arm of the Great Rift Valley, covers the western portion of the area. The Matengo Mountains ranges, which reach heights of up to 2000 meters, are to the east of the Rift Valley. In a similar vein, the Lukumburu Mountains, which can reach an elevation of 2000 meters above sea level, are located to the north. The Ruvuma River cuts across the lower plains in the region&#x27;s south. The region has diverse topology. While the Lukumburu and Matengo mountains&#x27; northern and western portions climb to a height of 2,000 meters above sea level, the region&#x27;s eastern lowlands are only 300 meters above sea level.

===Climate===
Depending on the wet or dry season and altitude, the average temperature in the Ruvuma Region is 23°C. With lows of 13°C, the months of June, July, and August are particularly frigid in the Mbinga District&#x27;s sections near the Matengo Highlands. The hottest months are October and November, which have an average temperature of 30°C. The area receives enough rainfall each year, excluding tough years. The annual cycle of rainfall shows a single, extended season that runs from November to May. The annual rainfall ranges from 800 to 1800 millimeters. The amount of rain varies from one district to the next, with Tunduru District typically receiving less than 900 mm of rain annually, while Mbinga District records the greatest annual average rainfall of 1,225 mm. Particularly early in the day, the location of Ruvuma experiences relatively high mean humidity. In the month of March, the humidity is approximately 88 percent during the day, while in the month of October, it may only be 37 percent at night.
===Fauna===
Woodlands, bushland thickets, and grasslands make up the fauna of Ruvuma Region. Arable land&#x27;s typical vegetation consists of planted trees, bamboos, and shrubs. The majority of the area is covered by miombo forests, which also extend into some areas of Tunduru, Mbinga, and the rural Songea district. Plantations of eucalyptus and pine trees have been planted all around Mount Matogoro.There are three species of common trees in the area: branchstegia, julbernardia, and isoberlinia. In recent times, a sizable portion of the Ruvuma region was covered by the forests (Miombo).
Lower slopes include the bushland. The growth of bushes is a result of tree-cutting, shifting cultivation, curing tobacco, and forest clearing. Due to the harmful human activities outlined above, as well as the impacts of drainage and rainfall, grasslands are typically widespread in lowlands and plateau. Ruvuma, Njuga, Ngembambili, Lukimwa, Luegu, Luhuji, Mbarang&#x27;angu, Lutukira, and Ruhuhu were just a few of the rivers in the region.

==Economy==
According to the 2012 Population and Housing Census, approximately 75.8% of the region&#x27;s population 10 years of age and older are employed in agriculture, which also provides the majority of the region&#x27;s cash income from the production of coffee, beans, maize, ground nuts, paddy, potatoes, tobacco, cassava, sesame, millet, coconuts, cashew nuts, sorghum, fruits, and sunflowers. Approximately 7.5 percent of the active population work in trade and commerce, which is the second-most significant industry after agriculture. Domestic services (2.2 percent), manufacturing (1.7 percent), sales of raw foods (1.5 percent), fishing, hunting, and raising livestock (1.4 percent), and communications and transportation (2.9 percent) are the next most common occupations (0.1 percent).
===Agriculture===
The prevalence of smallholder peasant subsistence farming is one of the general characteristics of agriculture in the area. Smallholder farmers use improved seeds and fertilizers at a relatively higher rate than smallholder farmers in other areas, which accounts for the abundance of perennial goods like coffee (mostly grown in Mbinga District) and cashew nuts as well as annual crops like maize, sunflower, and soy beans that are reported to be marketed in large quantities (mostly in Tunduru and Namtumbo).With a 61 percent share of the planted land, maize is the most common crop, followed by cassava (19 percent), paddy (15 percent), and beans (5 percent).

The appropriateness of Ruvuma&#x27;s districts for crop production varies: Songea DC has the highest percentage of maize planted land (28.9%), followed by Mbinga DC (23.7%), Namtumbo DC (12.6%), and Madaba DC (10.3 percent). It&#x27;s interesting to note that, although cultivating only 4.3 percent of the total area under maize, Tunduru DC contributes 13.5 percent of the crop.Of course, Songea DC continues to lead in production, with an average of 119,640 metric tonnes produced year (28.7%), followed by Mbinga DC (20.8%) and Tunduru (56,408 metric tonnes) (13.5 percent). Namtumbo DC appeared to have the lowest productivity since, although having 12.6% of the region&#x27;s planted maize area, it contributes only 8.4% of the region&#x27;s total production.

Cassava is another crop that is equally significant for both food and money, and it is mostly grown in Namtumbo DC (40%) as well as Nyasa DC (24.8%), Tunduru DC (18.3%), and Songea DC (12.6 percent). Four LGAs, namely Namtumbo DC (53%), Tunduru DC (24.9%), and Nyasa DC, farm paddy (11.2 percent).
Beans are mostly produced in the following districts: Madaba DC (63.9%), Songea DC (24.2%), Songea MC (7.1%), and Namtumbo DC (4.7 percent).

The Region was successful in allocating an average of 70,806 ha (or 22.7 percent of the Region&#x27;s total land area) per year for cash crops between 2011 and 2015. Sesame is the main crop, covering 16,072 acres (or 22.7 percent). Pigeon peas (13,432 ha, 19.0%), coffee (10,037 ha, 14.2%), soy beans (9,904 ha, 14.0%), tobacco (7,045 ha, 9.9%), sunflower (6,765 ha, 9.6%), cashew nuts (5,643 ha, 8.0%), and groundnuts (5,643 ha, 8.0%) came in second and third, respectively (1,908 ha, 2.7 percent). However, in terms of output volume, tobacco (37.9%) took the top spot, followed by pigeon peas (16.6%), sesame (14.1%), cashew nuts (13%) and ground nuts (13%) as well as coffee (8.8%), soy beans (4.4%), sunflower (2.9%), and sesame (2.3 percent).

Although the bulk of ginger is sold raw, ginger production has increased in popularity in recent years, as well as some small-scale processing.
Along the region&#x27;s river valleys, tomatoes and other vegetables are grown. The region has roughly 197,108.2 ha that seem to be ideal for irrigated farming, however only 7,385.3 ha (equal to 3.7 percent) were utilized during the 2015 season. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Songea DC has the largest irrigation area (34.3%), followed by Nyasa DC (25.4%) and Tunduru DC (17.3%). Madaba DC has the smallest amount of land used for irrigated agriculture (3.7 percent). Paddy, horticulture crops, maize, and sweet potatoes were the main crops irrigated.

====Livestock and dairy====
The number of cattle increased by 517.1% and the number of sheep increased by 25.7 % between 2008 and 2012. In terms of animals, goats (272,147) outnumbered pigs (222,420), cattle (177,041), sheep (30,625), and donkeys in the area (997). Tunduru DC had a 33.3 percent share of the total cattle population in the area, followed by Mbinga DC (20.8 percent), Songea DC (13.7 percent), and Songea MC (2.5 percent).
There were reportedly 181,700 ha of land suitable for grazing livestock in the area, of which about 80,600 ha (44.4 percent) were actually used. In terms of facilities for animal health, there were 48 cattle dips in 2015, however only 16 of them were operational.

The value of livestock sales climbed from roughly TZS 1.5 billion in 2013 to TZS 7.8 billion in 2015, with sales of indigenous cattle and goats accounting for the majority (85%) of the rise (12.3 percent).
There is a chance to raise the percentage of sales value and the quantity of pigs and poultry. The number of units sold for hides and skins grew from 31,044 pieces in 2014 (worth TZS 203,338,200) to 43,020 pieces in 2015. (valued at TZS 259,840,800).
Despite a drop in milk output from 40,891 liters in 2014 to 37,738 liters in 2015, the region saw an increase in revenue thanks to an increase in market prices from TZS 1,000 to 1,300 per liter.

===Industry===
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) states that the classification of businesses as Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) and Large is based on the capital expenditure and number of employees: Micro industries are defined as those that employ fewer than five people and have less than TZS 5 million in capital; Small-scale industries are defined as those that have more capital than TZS 5 million but less than TZS 200 million and employ fewer than 50 people; and Medium-scale industries are defined as those. There were 5,263 small-scale businesses in 2015, and 49.9% of them were engaged in milling grains, primarily maize and paddy. The following industries were welding (7.6 percent), tailoring (7.6 percent), and carpentry (28.8 percent) (6.6 percent).
There were just 8 industries that processed sunflower oil (0.2 percent).

In terms of the overall number of small-scale industries, Mbinga DC was in first place (1,248 industries, 23.7 percent). Madaba DC has the fewest smallscale industries in the region, followed by Nyasa DC (22.2%) and Tunduru DC (20.4%). Nyasa DC accounted for the second-highest percentage of the region&#x27;s overall industries (142 industries, 2.7 percent). Mbinga DC had the biggest concentration of food processing (25) and welding businesses, as well as 858 maize and paddy milling equipment (283). Tunduru DC had the majority of garages (80) and carpentry industries (582) whereas Nyasa DC had the most tailoring businesses (279).

===Forestry===
Natural forest reserves made up a total of 1,283,870 ha in the Ruvuma Region in 2015, or 20.0 percent of its 6,476,400 ha total land area. Natural forest reserves covered the largest area (540,036.6 hectares) in Namtumbo DC, followed by Tunduru DC (323,125 ha), and the smallest area (7,632 ha) in Songea MC.
There were 38,075 traditional beehives between 2011 and 2015, the majority of which were in Madaba DC (16,708 beehives, or 43.9 percent), Namtumbo DC (8,950 beehives, or 23.5 percent), and Mbinga DC (6,213 beehives, 16.3 percent). The smallest number of traditional beehives was found in Mbinga TC (576 beehives, 1.5 percent).

===Fisheries===
The 2,979 square kilometer Lake Nyasa is the primary location for fishing operations. The waters of the Ruhuhu, Ruhuji, Lukimwa, Ruvuma, Mwambesi, Nampungu, and Muhuwesi rivers also produce a considerable number of fish through line fishing. The area distributed 3,345 fishing licenses in 2015. There are 675 unregistered fishing vessels, 1,761 registered fishing vessels, and 4,662 registered fisherman. Fish harvesting totaled 265,629 million tonnes, worth TZS 649,602,500, with the majority of it taking place in Nyasa DC, however fishing and selling are also done at modest levels in Songea DC and Namtumbo DC from the Ruvuma, Luwegu, and Londo rivers as well as from natural dams.
===Tourism===
The Ruvuma Region is endowed with attractions, most of which have not been developed to draw tourists. These attractions include landscape scenery, cultural attractions, the Mbamba Bay Port, unspoiled beach sites along Lake Nyasa, game hunting, historical and archaeological sites.

Sites like the Majimaji Museum and the Songea MC German historical buildings (boma) are located in the region. Muhuwesi, Undendeule, Mwambesi, Litumbandyosi, and Liparamba are the five game-controlled areas in Ruvuma. Muhuwesi and Mwambesi are in Tunduru DC, while Undendeule is in Namtumbo DC. Ruvuma has one national park (Nyerere National Park), as well as five other game-controlled regions.

===Mining===
Ruvuma Region contains a variety of gemstones, coal, uranium, gold, and diamonds, especially in the southernmost part of the territory. The distribution of the mineral deposits is as follows: coal is known to exist in the five basins of Ngaka, Muhukuru, Mbamba-Bay, Njuga, and Lumecha; gold is primarily thought to be present along Muhuwesi River in Tunduru DC; uranium reserves are particularly abundant in Namtumbo DC.

===GDP===
The Ruvuma Region&#x27;s GDP increased steadily from TZS 1.6 million in 2010 to TZS 2.3 million in 2012, then hit TZS 3.0 million in 2014 before reaching TZS 3.5 million in 2015. This is according to the 2015 National Accounts of Tanzania new series statistics. Therefore, between 2010 and 2015, the economy increased by 119 percent, or 23.8 percent year on average, which is much faster than the country as a whole.
In both years, the Ruvuma Region&#x27;s GDP per capita in current prices placed it fourth in the Tanzanian mainland economy. From TZS 1.7 million in 2012 to TZS 2.4 million in 2015, its per capita GDP grew. It was surpassed by the top-ranking cities of Dar es Salaam, Iringa, and Arusha.
==Population==
Wamatengo, Wangoni, Wayao, Wanyasa, Wandendeule, Wapoto, Wamanda, Wanindi and Wamatambwe are the indigenous ethnic groups in the Ruvuma Region. With more than 60% of the district&#x27;s population belonging to one ethnic group, Wamatengo, they are the dominant group in Mbinga district. Around with a few Wangoni, the Wanyasa, Wamanda, and Wapoto live along Lake Nyasa&#x27;s shoreline.

In Songea Urban, the Wangoni make up the majority of the ethnic groups, followed by the Wandendeule, Wamanda, Wayao, Wamatengo, and Wanyasa. Wayao constitute the majority ethnic group in Tunduru district. Additionally, Wamakua, Wandendeule, and Wamatambwe are contained inside them. The two most common ethnic groups in Songea&#x27;s rural district are Wangoni and Wandendeule, who live in the Ruvuma and Ndendeule divisions, respectively. The divisions of Muhukuru, Sasawala, and Madaba are occupied by additional small ethnic groups such the Wayao, Wabena, and Wanindi.

In 2018, there were more than 1.56 million people living in the Ruvuma Region, with 74.5 percent of them living in rural areas and 25.5 percent in urban areas.

==Administrative divisions==
===Districts===
Ruvuma Region is divided into five districts, each administered by a council:

===Constituencies===
For parliamentary elections, Tanzania is divided into constituencies. As of the 2010 elections, the Ruvuma Region had six constituencies:

# Nyasa Constituency
# Mbinga Mjini Constituency
# Mbinga Vijijini Constituency
# Namtumbo Constituency
# Peramiho Constituency
# Songea Mjini Constituency
# Tunduru Constituency
# Madaba Constituency

==Health and Education==
===Healthcare===
With one health center serving 16 wards as of 2015, Mbinga TC has the greatest shortfall of health centers and dispensaries, followed by Songea DC (16 wards per health center) and Mbinga DC with an average of 15 wards per health center. However, Nyasa District 5 had a ratio of 5 wards per health facility, followed by Namtumbo DC with 4 wards per health facility. Nearly 4 mitaa are typically facilitated by each dispensary, with Madaba DC having the lowest ratio of 2 villages per dispensary. Following it were Mbinga DC, Mbinga TC, Songea DC, and Tunduru DC, each with three villages and a dispensary.

===Education===
Although students appeared to perform better in transitioning from primary to secondary education (with passes ranging from 60.4 percent for Namtumbo DC to 71.5 percent for Mbinga), Form IV results indicated that something was wrong either at the primary or secondary school level. This is due to the fact that, of those who took the Form IV examination, less than 15% received grades in Divisions I, II, and III. A little over 50% of the remaining students received Division 0 while about 34% received Division IV (failed).

Only nine vocational training facilities existed in the area up to 2015, and they were situated in Mbinga TC, Namtumbo DC, Songea DC, and Tunduru DC.
In all, 476 Vocational Skills Training (VST) students graduated in 2015; the courses provided include driving, electrical installation and plumbing, masonry and joinery, carpentry, and tailoring.
As of 2019, the Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) has opened branches in Nyasa DC, Tunduru DC, and Madaba DC for the training of programs relating to tourism, wildlife management, and beekeeping.

<doc id="1046687" wikidata="Q1498677" url="?curid=1046687" title="Equal-loudness contour">
<text>An equal-loudness contour is a measure of sound pressure level, over the frequency spectrum, for which a listener perceives a constant loudness when presented with pure steady tones. The unit of measurement for loudness levels is the phon and is arrived at by reference to equal-loudness contours. By definition, two sine waves of differing frequencies are said to have equal-loudness level measured in phons if they are perceived as equally loud by the average young person without significant hearing impairment.

The Fletcher–Munson curves are one of many sets of equal-loudness contours for the human ear, determined experimentally by Harvey Fletcher and Wilden A. Munson, and reported in a 1933 paper entitled &quot;Loudness, its definition, measurement and calculation&quot; in the &quot;Journal of the Acoustical Society of America&quot;. Fletcher–Munson curves have been superseded and incorporated into newer standards. The definitive curves are those defined in ISO 226 from the International Organization for Standardization, which are based on a review of modern determinations made in various countries.

Amplifiers often feature a &quot;loudness&quot; button, known technically as loudness compensation, that boosts low and high-frequency components of the sound. These are intended to offset the apparent loudness fall-off at those frequencies, especially at lower volume levels. Boosting these frequencies produces a flatter equal-loudness contour that appears to be louder even at low volume, preventing the perceived sound from being dominated by the mid-frequencies where the ear is most sensitive.

== Fletcher–Munson curves ==
The first research on the topic of how the ear hears different frequencies at different levels was conducted by Fletcher and Munson in 1933. Until recently, it was common to see the term &quot;Fletcher–Munson&quot; used to refer to equal-loudness contours generally, even though a re-determination was carried out by Robinson and Dadson in 1956, which became the basis for an ISO 226 standard.

The generic term &quot;equal-loudness contours&quot; is now preferred, of which the Fletcher–Munson curves are now a sub-set, and especially since a 2003 survey by ISO redefined the curves in a new standard.

==Experimental determination==
The human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from about 20 Hz to a maximum of around 20,000 Hz, although the upper hearing limit decreases with age. Within this range, the human ear is most sensitive between 2 and 5 kHz, largely due to the resonance of the ear canal and the transfer function of the ossicles of the middle ear.

Fletcher and Munson first measured equal-loudness contours using headphones (1933). In their study, test subjects listened to pure tones at various frequencies and over 10 dB increments in stimulus intensity. For each frequency and intensity, the listener also listened to a reference tone at 1000 Hz. Fletcher and Munson adjusted the reference tone until the listener perceived that it had the same loudness as the test tone. Loudness, being a psychological quantity, is difficult to measure, so Fletcher and Munson averaged their results over many test subjects to derive reasonable averages. The lowest equal-loudness contour represents the quietest audible tone—the &quot;absolute threshold of hearing&quot;. The highest contour is the &quot;threshold of pain&quot;.

Churcher and King carried out a second determination in 1937, but their results and Fletcher and Munson&#x27;s showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram.

In 1956 Robinson and Dadson produced a new experimental determination that they believed was more accurate. It became the basis for a standard (ISO 226) that was considered definitive until 2003, when ISO revised the standard on the basis of recent assessments by research groups worldwide.

==Recent revision aimed at more precise determination – ISO 226:2023==
Perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations led the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to revise the standard curves in ISO 226. They did this in response to recommendations in a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies—by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and the US. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.)

This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, and the fact that the original Fletcher–Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson–Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15 dB, especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons not explained.

According to the ISO report, the Robinson–Dadson results were the odd one out, differing more from the current standard than did the Fletcher–Munson curves. The report states that it is fortunate that the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve on which the A-weighting standard was based turns out to have been in agreement with modern determinations.

The report also comments on the large differences apparent in the low-frequency region, which remain unexplained. Possible explanations are:
* The equipment used was not properly calibrated.
* The criteria used for judging equal loudness at different frequencies had differed.
* Subjects were not properly rested for days in advance, or were exposed to loud noise in traveling to the tests, which tensed the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles controlling low-frequency mechanical coupling.

==Side versus frontal presentation==

Real-life sounds from a reasonably distant source arrive as planar wavefronts. If the source of sound is directly in front of the listener, then both ears receive equal intensity, but at frequencies above about 1 kHz the sound that enters the ear canal is partially reduced by the head shadow, and also highly dependent on reflection off the pinna (outer ear). Off-centre sounds result in increased head masking at one ear, and subtle changes in the effect of the pinna, especially at the other ear. This combined effect of head-masking and pinna reflection is quantified in a set of curves in three-dimensional space referred to as head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Frontal presentation is now regarded as preferable when deriving equal-loudness contours, and the latest ISO standard is specifically based on frontal and central presentation. 

Because no HRTF is involved in normal headphone listening, equal-loudness curves derived using headphones are valid only for the special case of what is called &quot;side-presentation&quot;, which is not how we normally hear. 

The Robinson–Dadson determination used loudspeakers, and for a long time the difference from the Fletcher–Munson curves was explained partly on the basis that the latter used headphones. However, the ISO report actually lists the latter as using &quot;compensated&quot; headphones, though it doesn&#x27;t make clear how Robinson–Dadson achieved &quot;compensation&quot;.

==Headphones versus loudspeaker testing==

Good headphones, well sealed to the ear, provide a flat low-frequency pressure response to the ear canal, with low distortion even at high intensities. At low frequencies, the ear is purely pressure-sensitive, and the cavity formed between headphones and ear is too small to introduce modifying resonances. Headphone testing is, therefore, a good way to derive equal-loudness contours below about 500 Hz, though reservations have been expressed about the validity of headphone measurements when determining the actual threshold of hearing, based on the observation that closing off the ear canal produces increased sensitivity to the sound of blood flow within the ear, which the brain appears to mask in normal listening conditions. At high frequencies, headphone measurement becomes unreliable, and the various resonances of pinnae (outer ears) and ear canals are severely affected by proximity to the headphone cavity.

With speakers, the opposite is true. A flat low-frequency response is hard to obtain—except in free space high above ground, or in a very large and anechoic chamber that is free from reflections down to 20 Hz. Until recently, it was not possible to achieve high levels at frequencies down to 20 Hz without high levels of harmonic distortion. Even today, the best speakers are likely to generate around 1 to 3% of total harmonic distortion, corresponding to 30 to 40 dB below fundamental. This is not good enough, given the steep rise in loudness (rising to as much as 24 dB per octave) with frequency revealed by the equal-loudness curves below about 100 Hz. A good experimenter must ensure that trial subjects really hear the fundamental and not harmonics—especially the third harmonic, which is especially strong as a speaker cone&#x27;s travel becomes limited as its suspension reaches the limit of compliance. A possible way around the problem is to use acoustic filtering, such as by resonant cavity, in the speaker setup. A flat free-field high-frequency response up to 20 kHz, on the other hand, is comparatively easy to achieve with modern speakers on-axis. These effects must be considered when comparing results of various attempts to measure equal-loudness contours.

==Relevance to sound level and noise measurements==
The A-weighting curve—in widespread use for noise measurement—is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve. However, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyzes sounds in terms of spectral content, each &quot;hair-cell&quot; responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low-frequency bands, and therefore &quot;collect&quot; proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the signals to the brain add the various bands to produce the impressions of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1 kHz and a downward tilt below 1 kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.

Various weighting curves were derived in the 1960s, in particular as part of the DIN 4550 standard for audio quality measurement, which differed from the A-weighting curve, showing more of a peak around 6 kHz. These gave a more meaningful subjective measure of noise on audio equipment, especially on the newly invented compact cassette tape recorders with Dolby noise reduction, which were characterized by a noise spectrum dominated by the higher frequencies.

BBC Research conducted listening trials in an attempt to find the best weighting curve and rectifier combination for use when measuring noise in broadcast equipment, examining the various new weighting curves in the context of noise rather than tones, confirming that they were much more valid than A-weighting when attempting to measure the subjective loudness of noise. This work also investigated the response of human hearing to tone-bursts, clicks, pink noise and a variety of other sounds that, because of their brief impulsive nature, do not give the ear and brain sufficient time to respond. The results were reported in BBC Research Report EL-17 1968/8 entitled &quot;The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits&quot;.

The ITU-R 468 noise weighting curve, originally proposed in CCIR recommendation 468, but later adopted by numerous standards bodies (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) was based on the research, and incorporates a special quasi-peak detector to account for our reduced sensitivity to short bursts and clicks. It is widely used by Broadcasters and audio professionals when they measure noise on broadcast paths and audio equipment, so they can subjectively compare equipment types with different noise spectra and characteristics.

<doc id="1046688" wikidata="Q1136742" url="?curid=1046688" title="Snow (Spock's Beard album)">
<text>Snow is the sixth studio album of the progressive rock band Spock&#x27;s Beard, and the final album with main songwriter and vocalist Neal Morse, who left immediately after the release of the album due to his conversion to Christianity. It was released in 2002 on Radiant Records.

A concept album, &quot;Snow&quot; follows the story of &quot;Snow&quot;, a 17 year old albino with mystical healing powers who goes on a journey through ego and unrequited love and is ultimately redeemed by spirituality in the end.

==Background and recording==
Neal Morse began recording &quot;Snow&quot; in summer of 2001, when he flew from Tennessee to Los Angeles, California. Upon arrival, he wasn&#x27;t satisfied with his recording of the album, and decided to re-write it, in order to create a decent concept piece. For that, he needed to fly back. He then returned with an almost completely rewritten version, which Dave Meros was surprised by, because he awaited the revised version. The group then completed recording it overnight, on September 10, 2001. The next day, Spock&#x27;s Beard was scheduled to fly back to Tennessee, but due to the September 11 attacks, ended up stranded in the airport.

Spock&#x27;s Beard decided to rent a car so they could get safely home. During that time, while the group listened to Bob Dylan and God Bless America (which was sung by Congress over the radio), Neal Morse got an idea for the album&#x27;s concept. It will become a mysterious Albino psychic and healer. Upon returning to Tennessee, Neal spent months polishing the concept and writing more songs, but upon returning to LA, he suffered an emotional wreck, and decided to quit the band, the announcement of which came nine months after the first recording of the album. He told his band members that he was a devoted Christian, and viewed the songs &quot;Open Wide the Flood Gates,&quot; &quot;Love Beyond Words,&quot; and Wind at My Back&quot; as prayers. He then had a hard time deciding whether to go with the band&#x27;s ideology, or create his own solo album, with a focus on Christianity as its base. After the recording was complete, Neal said his farewells to the former band. Due to Neal&#x27;s departure, the &quot;Snow&quot; tour was cancelled.

Neal Morse and Nick D&#x27;Virgilio returned to the band in 2016 for the &quot;Snow Live&quot; concert at Morsefest in Nashville, Tennessee. &quot;Snow Live&quot; was also performed once more in 2016 at the Night of the Prog festival in Loreley, Germany.

==Live release==
On November 10, 2017, Spock&#x27;s Beard released a live Blu-ray DVD version of the album via Metal Blade and Radiant Records. The DVD version contains both parts of the album, as well as encores &quot;June&quot; and &quot;Falling for Forever&quot;, and behind the scenes featurette &quot;The Making of Snow Live&quot;.

<doc id="1046704" wikidata="Q1052046" url="?curid=1046704" title="Native Command Queuing">
<text>In computing, Native Command Queuing (NCQ) is an extension of the Serial ATA protocol allowing hard disk drives to internally optimize the order in which received read and write commands are executed. This can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement, resulting in increased performance (and slightly decreased wear of the drive) for workloads where multiple simultaneous read/write requests are outstanding, most often occurring in server-type applications.

== History ==
Native Command Queuing was preceded by Parallel ATA&#x27;s version of Tagged Command Queuing (TCQ). ATA&#x27;s attempt at integrating TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host bus adapters use ISA bus device protocols to interact with the operating system. The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for ATA TCQ.

NCQ differs from TCQ in that, with NCQ, each command is of equal importance, but NCQ&#x27;s host bus adapter also programs its own first party DMA engine with CPU-given DMA parameters during its command sequence whereas TCQ interrupts the CPU during command queries and requires it to modulate the ATA host bus adapter&#x27;s third party DMA engine. NCQ&#x27;s implementation is preferable because the drive has more accurate knowledge of its performance characteristics and is able to account for its rotational position. Both NCQ and TCQ have a maximum queue length of 32 outstanding commands. Because the ATA TCQ is rarely used, Parallel ATA (and the IDE mode of some chipsets) usually only support one outstanding command per port.

For NCQ to be enabled, it must be supported and enabled in the SATA host bus adapter and in the hard drive itself. The appropriate driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the host bus adapter.

Many newer chipsets support the Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), which allows operating systems to universally control them and enable NCQ. DragonFly BSD has supported AHCI with NCQ since 2.3 in 2009. Linux kernels support AHCI natively since version 2.6.19, and FreeBSD fully supports AHCI since version 8.0. Windows Vista and Windows 7 also natively support AHCI, but their AHCI support (via the msahci service) must be manually enabled via registry editing if controller support was not present during their initial install. Windows 7&#x27;s AHCI enables not only NCQ but also TRIM support on SSD drives (with their supporting firmware). Older operating systems such as Windows XP require the installation of a vendor-specific driver (similar to installing a RAID or SCSI controller) even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter, which makes initial setup more tedious and conversions of existing installations relatively difficult as most controllers cannot operate their ports in mixed AHCI–SATA/IDE/legacy mode.

== Hard disk drives ==

=== Performance ===
A 2004 test with the first-generation NCQ drive (Seagate 7200.7 NCQ) found that while NCQ increased IOMeter performance, desktop application performance decreased. One review in 2010 found improvements on the order of 9% (on average) with NCQ enabled in a series of Windows multitasking tests.

NCQ can negatively interfere with the operating system&#x27;s I/O scheduler, decreasing performance; this has been observed in practice on Linux with RAID-5. There is no mechanism in NCQ for the host to specify any sort of deadlines for an I/O, like how many times a request can be ignored in favor of others. In theory, a queued request can be delayed by the drive an arbitrary amount of time while it is serving other (possibly new) requests under I/O pressure. Since the algorithms used inside drives&#x27; firmware for NCQ dispatch ordering are generally not publicly known, this introduces another level of uncertainty for hardware/firmware performance. Tests at Google around 2008 have shown that NCQ can delay an I/O for up to 1–2 seconds. A proposed workaround is for the operating system to artificially starve the NCQ queue sooner in order to satisfy low-latency applications in a timely manner.

On some drives&#x27; firmware, such as the WD Raptor circa 2007, read-ahead is disabled when NCQ is enabled, resulting in slower sequential performance.

SATA solid-state drives profit significantly from being able to queue multiple commands for parallel workloads. For PCIe-based NVMe SSDs, the queue depth was even increased to support a maximum of 65,535 queues with up to 65,535 commands each.

=== Safety (FUA) ===
One lesser-known feature of NCQ is that, unlike its ATA TCQ predecessor, it allows the host to specify whether it wants to be notified when the data reaches the disk&#x27;s platters, or when it reaches the disk&#x27;s buffer (on-board cache). Assuming a correct hardware implementation, this feature allows data consistency to be guaranteed when the disk&#x27;s on-board cache is used in conjunction with system calls like fsync. The associated write flag, which is also borrowed from SCSI, is called Force Unit Access (FUA).

== Solid-state drives ==
NCQ is also used in newer solid-state drives where the drive encounters latency on the host, rather than the other way around. For example, Intel&#x27;s X25-E Extreme solid-state drive uses NCQ to ensure that the drive has commands to process while the host system is busy processing CPU tasks.

NCQ also enables the SSD controller to complete commands concurrently (or partly concurrently, for example using pipelines) where the internal organisation of the device enables such processing.

The NVM Express (NVMe) standard also supports command queuing, in a form optimized for SSDs. NVMe allows multiple queues for a single controller and device, allowing at the same time much higher depths for each queue, which more closely matches how the underlying SSD hardware works.

<doc id="1046705" wikidata="Q730413" url="?curid=1046705" title="South Dock, Rotherhithe">
<text>South Dock is one of two surviving docks in the former Surrey Commercial Docks in Rotherhithe, London, England. It was built in 1807–1811 just south of the larger Greenland Dock, to which it is connected by a channel now known as Greenland Cut; it also has a lock giving access to the River Thames. Originally named the &quot;East Country Dock&quot;, it was renamed in 1850 when the Surrey Commercial Dock Company purchased and enlarged it. Timber and grain were the main products imported and exported in the dock.

==World War II==
The dock was seriously damaged by German attacks in World War II when the area was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. Due to bomb damage in Greenland Dock, South Dock became the only exit from that dock. It was emptied of shipping in 1944, drained and used for the construction of concrete sections for the Mulberry Harbours used on D-Day. After the war, it was repaired and the surrounding warehouses rebuilt.

==After the war==
The revival of the Surrey Docks proved short-lived with the advent of containerization from the 1960s onwards. The new container ships were much too big to be accommodated in the upstream London docks and, with a few exceptions, most of the river trade moved downriver to Tilbury and other more modern ports around the country. The Surrey Docks closed in December 1970 and were sold to the London Borough of Southwark in 1977.

==Redevelopment==
Although most of the Surrey Docks were infilled and converted to residential, commercial or light industrial land, South Dock escaped this fate. The former warehouses were demolished and replaced with residential blocks, while the dock itself was refurbished. Residential development in the area received funding from the London Docklands Development Corporation, erecting unique buildings, such as Baltic Quay. In 1994, South Dock reopened as London&#x27;s largest marina, with over 200 berths. It is now largely occupied by yachts and residential barges.

<text>The Language Council of Norway (, ) is the administrative body of the Norwegian state on language issues. It regulates the two written forms of the Norwegian language: Bokmål and Nynorsk. It was established in 2005 and replaced the Norwegian Language Council (, ) which existed from 1974 to 2005. It is a subsidiary agency of the Ministry of Culture and has forty-four employees (as per 2023). It is one of two organisations involved in language standardization in Norway, alongside the Norwegian Academy.

== History ==

===Norwegian Language Council===
The Norwegian Language Council (1974–2005) had the task of safeguarding the cultural heritage represented by the Norwegian written and spoken language, promoting measures that can increase knowledge of the Norwegian language, promoting tolerance and mutual respect between everyone who uses the Norwegian language in its various variants, and protecting the rights of the individual person when it comes to the use of language. Among the most important tasks of the council were standardization of Bokmål and Nynorsk, linguistic advice and linguistic quality assurance of textbooks.

In 2000, the council was tasked with working with the Norwegian language and information technology. The Norwegian Language Council registered new words, put forward proposals for replacement words instead of English import words and promoted measures to ensure linguistic equality between Bokmål and Nynorsk. The council published the publications &quot;Språknytt&quot; and &quot;Statspråk&quot;. 

It had 38 members, which represented different stakeholders, such as other language organisations including the Norwegian Academy, Riksmålsforbundet and Noregs Mållag, but also the educational sector and the media. The council created lists of acceptable word forms. Some words previously had two forms, the official form which were to be used in government documents and textbooks, and optional forms, which could be used by students in state schools. However, after 2005 this difference no longer exists in the lists published by the Language Council of Norway.

===Language Council of Norway===
In 2003, the Storting agreed to a proposal to transform the Norwegian Language Council into a national competence center for the Norwegian language. The new body was established on 1 January 2005. In May 2005, it was decided to name the institution the Language Council. It no longer represents the language organizations. In 2005, the Language Service for state bodies was also established following a decision in the Storting. The Language Service has two equal tasks: to promote plain language within the government and ensure more even distribution between Nynorsk and Bokmål in state documents.

Sylfest Lomheim served as the first director of the Council until 1 September 2010. Åse Wetås has been leading the Council since 2015.

===Controversies===
In 2006, the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Ny Tid&quot; requested that the council choose an alternative to the term &quot;ethnic Norwegians&quot; because the term might be alienating or exclusionary to immigrants to Norway. In response, the council denied that immigrants were Norwegians or could ever become Norwegians, writing: &quot;We do not believe that there is a need to replace ‘ethnic Norwegian’ by another term. We believe it is incorrect to call people from other countries ‘Norwegians’ because ‘Norwegian’ by definition refers to someone of ethnic Norwegian descent. A Pakistani who settles in Norway does not become Norwegian, not even if he becomes a Norwegian citizen.&quot; The council&#x27;s narrow definition of Norwegian identity sparked controversy in Norwegian news media and on Norwegian social media.

==The board==
The Ministry of Culture has appointed the following board for the period 2020–2023:

* Board director: Erik Ulfsby (bokmål)
* Deputy director: Lodve Solholm (nynorsk)
* Terje Lohndal (bokmål)
* Eli Bjørhusdal (nynorsk)
* Lars Ivar Nordal (nynorsk) 
* Torunn Reksten (bokmål)
* Employee representatives

<text>Elfriede Jelinek (; born 20 October 1946) is an Austrian playwright and novelist. She is one of the most decorated authors to write in German and was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Literature for her &quot;musical flow of voices and counter-voices in novels and plays that, with extraordinary linguistic zeal, reveal the absurdity of society&#x27;s clichés and their subjugating power&quot;. She is considered to be among the most important living playwrights of the German language.

== Biography ==
Elfriede Jelinek was born on 20 October 1946 in Mürzzuschlag, Styria, the daughter of Olga Ilona (&quot;née&quot; Buchner), a personnel director, and Friedrich Jelinek. She was raised in Vienna by her Romanian-German Catholic mother and a non-observant Czech Jewish father (whose surname &quot;Jelinek&quot; means &quot;little deer&quot; in Czech). Her mother&#x27;s family came from Stájerlakanina, Krassó-Szörény County, Banat, Kingdom of Hungary (now Anina, Romania), and was of a bourgeois background, while her father was a working-class socialist.

Her father was a chemist, who managed to avoid persecution during the Second World War by working in strategically important industrial production. However, many of his relatives became victims of the Holocaust. Her mother, with whom she had a strained relationship, was from a formerly prosperous Vienna family. As a child, Elfriede attended a Roman Catholic convent school in Vienna. Her mother planned a career for her as a musical &quot;Wunderkind&quot;. She was instructed in piano, organ, guitar, violin, viola, and recorder from an early age. Later, she went on to study at the Vienna Conservatory, where she graduated with an organist diploma; during this time, she tried to meet her mother&#x27;s high expectations, while coping with her psychologically ill father. She studied art history and theater at the University of Vienna. However, she had to discontinue her studies due to an anxiety disorder, which resulted in self-isolation at her parents&#x27; house for a year. During this time, she began serious literary work as a form of therapy. After a year, she began to feel comfortable leaving the house, often with her mother. She began writing poetry at a young age. She made her literary debut with &quot;Lisas Schatten&quot; (&quot;Lisa&#x27;s Shadow&quot;) in 1967, and received her first literary prize in 1969. During the 1960s, she became active politically, read a great deal, and &quot;spent an enormous amount of time watching television&quot;.

She married Gottfried Hüngsberg on 12 June 1974.

== Work and political engagement ==
Despite the author&#x27;s own differentiation from Austria (due to her criticism of Austria&#x27;s Nazi past), Jelinek&#x27;s writing is deeply rooted in the tradition of Austrian literature, showing the influence of Austrian writers such as Ingeborg Bachmann, Marlen Haushofer, and Robert Musil.

Editor Friederike Eigler states that Jelinek has three major and inter-related &quot;targets&quot; in her writing: what she views as capitalist consumer society and its commodification of all human beings and relationships, what she views as the remnants of Austria&#x27;s fascist past in public and private life, and what she views as the systematic exploitation and oppression of women in a capitalist-patriarchal society. Jelinek has claimed in multiple interviews that the Austrian-Jewish satirical tradition has been a formative influence on her writing, citing Karl Kraus, Elias Canetti, and Jewish cabaret in particular. In an interview with Sigrid Löffler, Jelinek claimed that her work is considered an oddity in contemporary Austria, where she claims satire is unappreciated and misunderstood, &quot;because the Jews are dead.&quot; She has stressed her Jewish identity as the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, claiming a continuity with a Jewish-Viennese tradition that she believes has been destroyed by fascism and is dying out.

=== Work ===
Jelinek&#x27;s output has included radio plays, poetry, theatre texts, polemical essays, anthologies, novels, translations, screenplays, musical compositions, libretti and ballets, film and video art.
Jelinek&#x27;s work is multi-faceted, and highly controversial. It has been praised and condemned by leading literary critics. In the wake of the Fritzl case, for example, she was accused of &quot;executing &#x27;hysterical&#x27; portraits of Austrian perversity&quot;. Likewise, her political activism has encountered divergent and often heated reactions. Despite the controversy surrounding her work, Jelinek has won many distinguished awards; among them are the Georg Büchner Prize in 1998; the Mülheim Dramatists Prize in 2002 and 2004; the Franz Kafka Prize in 2004; and the Nobel Prize in Literature, also in 2004.

Female sexuality, sexual abuse, and the battle of the sexes in general are prominent topics in her work. Texts such as &quot;Wir sind Lockvögel, Baby!&quot; (&quot;We are Decoys, Baby!&quot;), &quot;Die Liebhaberinnen&quot; (&quot;Women as Lovers&quot;) and &quot;Die Klavierspielerin&quot; (&quot;The Piano Teacher&quot;) showcase the brutality and power play inherent in human relations in a style that is, at times, ironically formal and tightly controlled. According to Jelinek, power and aggression are often the principal driving forces of relationships. Likewise &quot;Ein Sportstück&quot; (&quot;Sports Play&quot;) explores the darker side of competitive sports. Her provocative novel &quot;Lust&quot; contains graphic description of sexuality, aggression and abuse. It received poor reviews by many critics, some of whom likened it to pornography. But others, who noted the power of the cold descriptions of moral failures, considered it to have been misunderstood and undervalued by them.

In April 2006, Jelinek spoke out to support Peter Handke, whose play &quot;Die Kunst des Fragens&quot; (&quot;The Art of Asking&quot;) was removed from the repertoire of the Comédie-Française for his alleged support of Slobodan Milošević. Her work is less known in English-speaking countries. However, in July and August 2012, a major English language premiere of her play &quot;Ein Sportstück&quot; by Just a Must theatre company brought her dramatic work to the attention of English-speaking audiences. The following year, in February and March 2013, the Women&#x27;s Project in New York staged the North American premiere of &quot;Jackie&quot;, one of her &quot;Princess Dramas&quot;.

=== Political engagement ===
Jelinek was a member of Austria&#x27;s Communist Party from 1974 to 1991. She became a household name during the 1990s due to her vociferous clash with Jörg Haider&#x27;s Freedom Party. Following the 1999 National Council elections, and the subsequent formation of a coalition cabinet consisting of the Freedom Party and the Austrian People&#x27;s Party, Jelinek became one of the new cabinet&#x27;s more vocal critics.

Many foreign governments moved swiftly to ostracize Austria&#x27;s administration, citing the Freedom Party&#x27;s alleged nationalism and authoritarianism. The cabinet construed the sanctions against it as directed against Austria as such, and attempted to prod the nation into a national rallying (&quot;Nationaler Schulterschluss&quot;) behind the coalition parties.

This provoked a temporary heating of the political climate severe enough for dissidents such as Jelinek to be accused of treason by coalition supporters.

In the mid- to late-1980s, Jelinek was one of many Austrian intellectuals who signed a petition for the release of Jack Unterweger, who was imprisoned for the murder of a prostitute, and who was regarded by intellectuals and politicians as an example of successful rehabilitation. Unterweger was later found guilty of murdering nine more women within two years of his release, and committed suicide after his arrest.

== In popular culture ==
Her novel &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; was the basis for the 2001 film of the same title by Austrian director Michael Haneke, starring Isabelle Huppert as the protagonist.

In 2022, a documentary about Jelinek was created by Claudia Müller, &quot;Elfriede Jelinek – Language Unleashed&quot; (German: &quot;Elfriede Jelinek – Die Sprache von der Leine lassen&quot;).

<text>Arnold Stephen Jacobs Jr., commonly called A.J. Jacobs (born March 20, 1968) is an American journalist, author, and lecturer best known for writing about his lifestyle experiments. He is an editor at large for &quot;Esquire&quot; and has worked for the &quot;Antioch Daily Ledger&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jacobs was born in New York City to secular Jewish parents, Arnold Jacobs Sr., a lawyer, and Ellen Kheel. He has one sister, Beryl Jacobs. He was educated at the Dalton School and Brown University.

==Career==
Jacobs has said that he sees his life as a series of experiments in which he immerses himself in a project or lifestyle, for better or worse, then writes about what he learned. The genre is often called immersion journalism or &quot;stunt journalism&quot;.

In one of these experiments (&quot;stunts&quot;) Jacobs read all 32 volumes of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, which he wrote about in his book, &quot;The Know-It-All: One Man&#x27;s Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World&quot; (2004). In the book, he also chronicles his personal life along with various endeavors like joining Mensa. The book spent eight weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.&quot; NPR&#x27;s Weekend Edition&quot; ran a series of segments featuring the unusual facts Jacobs learned in each letter. Jacobs also wrote a column for &quot;Mental Floss&quot; magazine describing the highlights of each volume. The book received positive reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time magazine&quot; and &quot;USA Today.&quot; However, Joe Queenan panned it in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;. Queenan called the book &quot;corny, juvenile, smug, tired&quot; and &quot;interminable&quot; and characterized Jacobs as &quot;a prime example of that curiously modern innovation: the pedigreed simpleton.&quot; Four months later, Jacobs responded in an essay entitled “I Am Not a Jackass”.

In 2005 Jacobs out-sourced his life to India such that personal assistants would do everything for him from answering his e-mails, reading his children good-night stories, and arguing with his wife. Jacobs wrote about it in an &quot;Esquire&quot; article called &quot;My Outsourced Life&quot; (2005). The article was excerpted in &quot;The 4-Hour Workweek&quot; by Timothy Ferriss. Jacobs also talked about his outsourcing experiences on a Moth storytelling podcast.

In another experiment Jacobs wrote an article for &quot;Esquire&quot; called &quot;I Think You&#x27;re Fat&quot; (2007), about the experiment he conducted with Radical Honesty, a lifestyle of total truth-telling promoted by Virginia therapist Brad Blanton, whom Jacobs interviewed for the article.

Jacobs&#x27; book &quot;The Year of Living Biblically: One Man&#x27;s Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible&quot; (2007) chronicles his experiment to live for one year according to all the moral codes expressed in the Bible, including stoning adulterers, blowing a shofar at the beginning of every month, and refraining from trimming the corners of his facial hair (which he followed by not trimming his facial hair at all). The book spent 11 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and Jacobs gave a TED talk about what he learned during the project. In May 2017, CBS Television picked up a TV series based on the book. It was originally renamed &quot;By the Book&quot; for television, but later changed to &quot;Living Biblically&quot;.

&quot;The Guinea Pig Diaries: My Life as an Experiment&quot; (2009) is a series of first person essays about his experiences with various guides for human behavior, including thanking everyone for the morning cup of coffee.

Jacobs is the author of &quot;The Two Kings: Elvis and Jesus&quot; (1994), an irreverent comedic comparison of Elvis Presley and Jesus; and &quot;America Off-Line&quot; (1996).

In his book &quot;Drop Dead Healthy: One Man&#x27;s Humble Quest for Bodily Perfection&quot; (2012), he explores different ways humans can bring their bodies to peak health, from diet to exercise. He wrote the book while walking on a treadmill. Jacobs gave a related TED talk about this health quest entitled &quot;How Healthy Living Nearly Killed Me&quot;.

From 2011 to 2012, Jacobs wrote the &quot;Extreme Health&quot; column for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, covering such topics as high-intensity interval training and the quantified self. Since 2012, he has written the &quot;Modern Problems&quot; advice column for &quot;mental floss&quot; magazine. The column compares modern day life to the horrors of the past.

As of May 2013, Jacobs writes a weekly advice column for Esquire.com called &quot;My Huddled Masses&quot;. The column is crowdsourced to Jacobs&#x27;s 100,000 Facebook followers, who give etiquette and love advice. He also writes the regular feature &quot;Obituaries&quot; for &quot;Esquire,&quot; which consists of satirical death notices for cultural trends, such as American hegemony.

On June 6, 2015, Jacobs hosted the Global Family Reunion at the New York Hall of Science. Satellite events were held in Salt Lake City, Utah (in partnership with FamilySearch; Cleveland, Ohio (at the Western Reserve Historical Society; Zionsville, Indiana; and Independence, Missouri (at the Midwest Genealogy Center). His project aimed to connect as many people as possible to the global family tree at Geni.com and WikiTree, and the event was planned to be the largest family reunion in history. His experience planning and hosting the event is documented in his 2017 book &quot;It&#x27;s All Relative.&quot;

On December 5, 2016, Gimlet Media announced Jacobs as the host of &quot;Twice Removed&quot;, a podcast focused on genealogy. In June 2016, Gimlet announced that the podcast would not be renewed for a second season.

Jacobs&#x27; April 2022 book &quot;The Puzzler&quot; reframes global issues as puzzles. In the fall of 2023, the daily podcast &quot;The Puzzler with A.J. Jacobs&quot; was launched.

In September, 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a story by Jacobs detailing a 1988 kayaking excursion in which he and his sister were lost overnight in the waterways of Glacier Bay National Park. They were eventually saved by an unknown group of campers on Kidney Island and a search seaplane rented by their father.

==Personal life==
Jacobs is married to Julie Schoenberg and has three sons: Jasper Kheel Jacobs (born March 11, 2004) and twins Zane and Lucas Jacobs (born August 24, 2006).

Jacobs is a first cousin once removed of the legal scholar Cass Sunstein.

Jacobs is a member of Giving What We Can; he has pledged to give 10% of his lifetime earnings to charity. He donates to the Against Malaria Foundation and other effective altruism organizations.

<doc id="1046736" wikidata="Q422009" url="?curid=1046736" title="Partial least squares regression">
<text>Partial least squares (PLS) regression is a statistical method that bears some relation to principal components regression and is a reduced rank regression; instead of finding hyperplanes of maximum variance between the response and independent variables, it finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space of maximum covariance (see below). Because both the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; data are projected to new spaces, the PLS family of methods are known as bilinear factor models. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is a variant used when the &quot;Y&quot; is categorical.

PLS is used to find the fundamental relations between two matrices (&quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;), i.e. a latent variable approach to modeling the covariance structures in these two spaces. A PLS model will try to find the multidimensional direction in the &quot;X&quot; space that explains the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the &quot;Y&quot; space. PLS regression is particularly suited when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observations, and when there is multicollinearity among &quot;X&quot; values. By contrast, standard regression will fail in these cases (unless it is regularized).

Partial least squares was introduced by the Swedish statistician Herman O. A. Wold, who then developed it with his son, Svante Wold. An alternative term for PLS is projection to latent structures, but the term &quot;partial least squares&quot; is still dominant in many areas. Although the original applications were in the social sciences, PLS regression is today most widely used in chemometrics and related areas. It is also used in bioinformatics, sensometrics, neuroscience, and anthropology.

== Core idea ==

We are given a sample of formula_1 paired observations formula_2.
In the first step formula_3, the partial least squares regression searches for the normalized direction formula_4, formula_5 that maximizes the covariance

: formula_6

Note below, the algorithm is denoted in matrix notation.

==Underlying model==

The general underlying model of multivariate PLS with formula_7 components is

:formula_8
:formula_9

where 
* is an formula_10 matrix of predictors
* is an formula_11 matrix of responses
* and are formula_12 matrices that are, respectively, projections of (the &quot;X score&quot;, &quot;component&quot; or &quot;factor&quot; matrix) and projections of (the &quot;Y scores&quot;)
* and are, respectively, formula_13 and formula_14 &quot;loading&quot; matrices
* and matrices and are the error terms, assumed to be independent and identically distributed random normal variables.

The decompositions of and are made so as to maximise the covariance between and .

Note that this covariance is defined pair by pair: the covariance of column &quot;i&quot; of (length &quot;n&quot;) with the column &quot;i&quot; of (length &quot;n&quot;) is maximized. Additionally, the covariance of the column i of with the column &quot;j&quot; of (with formula_15) is zero.

In PLSR, the loadings are thus chosen so that the scores form an orthogonal basis. This is a major difference with PCA where orthogonality is imposed onto loadings (and not the scores).

==Algorithms==

A number of variants of PLS exist for estimating the factor and loading matrices and . Most of them construct estimates of the linear regression between and as formula_16. Some PLS algorithms are only appropriate for the case where is a column vector, while others deal with the general case of a matrix . Algorithms also differ on whether they estimate the factor matrix as an orthogonal (that is, orthonormal) matrix or not. 
The final prediction will be the same for all these varieties of PLS, but the components will differ.

PLS is composed of iteratively repeating the following steps &quot;k&quot; times (for &quot;k&quot; components):
# finding the directions of maximal covariance in input and output space
# performing least squares regression on the input score
# deflating the input formula_17 and/or target formula_18

===PLS1===

PLS1 is a widely used algorithm appropriate for the vector case. It estimates as an orthonormal matrix.
(Caution: the vectors in the code below may not be normalized appropriately; see talk.)
In pseudocode it is expressed below (capital letters are matrices, lower case letters are vectors if they are superscripted and scalars if they are subscripted).

 15 
 16 define to be the matrix 
 Do the same to form the matrix and vector.
 17 
 18 ^\mathrm{T} B&lt;/math&gt;}}
 19 

This form of the algorithm does not require centering of the input and , as this is performed implicitly by the algorithm.
This algorithm features &#x27;deflation&#x27; of the matrix (subtraction of formula_19), but deflation of the vector is not performed, as it is not necessary (it can be proved that deflating yields the same results as not deflating). The user-supplied variable is the limit on the number of latent factors in the regression; if it equals the rank of the matrix , the algorithm will yield the least squares regression estimates for and formula_20
==Extensions==
=== OPLS ===
In 2002 a new method was published called orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS). In OPLS, continuous variable data is separated into predictive and uncorrelated (orthogonal) information. This leads to improved diagnostics, as well as more easily interpreted visualization. However, these changes only improve the interpretability, not the predictivity, of the PLS models. Similarly, OPLS-DA (Discriminant Analysis) may be applied when working with discrete variables, as in classification and biomarker studies.

The general underlying model of OPLS is

=== L-PLS ===
Another extension of PLS regression, named L-PLS for its L-shaped matrices, connects 3 related data blocks to improve predictability. In brief, a new &quot;Z&quot; matrix, with the same number of columns as the &quot;X&quot; matrix, is added to the PLS regression analysis and may be suitable for including additional background information on the interdependence of the predictor variables.

=== 3PRF===
In 2015 partial least squares was related to a procedure called the three-pass regression filter (3PRF). Supposing the number of observations and variables are large, the 3PRF (and hence PLS) is asymptotically normal for the &quot;best&quot; forecast implied by a linear latent factor model. In stock market data, PLS has been shown to provide accurate out-of-sample forecasts of returns and cash-flow growth.

=== Partial least squares SVD ===
A PLS version based on singular value decomposition (SVD) provides a memory efficient implementation that can be used to address high-dimensional problems, such as relating millions of genetic markers to thousands of imaging features in imaging genetics, on consumer-grade hardware.

=== PLS correlation ===

PLS correlation (PLSC) is another methodology related to PLS regression, which has been used in neuroimaging and sport science, to quantify the strength of the relationship between data sets. Typically, PLSC divides the data into two blocks (sub-groups) each containing one or more variables, and then uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to establish the strength of any relationship (i.e. the amount of shared information) that might exist between the two component sub-groups. It does this by using SVD to determine the inertia (i.e. the sum of the singular values) of the covariance matrix of the sub-groups under consideration.

<text>The Open University of the Netherlands () is a Dutch institution for distance learning at university level. It is an independent government-funded university and uses a variety of methods, including written materials, the Internet, and occasional evening seminars or day sessions.

== Overview ==
The Open University of the Netherlands was founded in 1984 and opened to students that September. The administration is based in Heerlen, in the province of Limburg, in the very south of the Netherlands. The university has study and support centres dispersed throughout the continental Netherlands, as well as study centres in Dutch-speaking Belgium (Flanders) and partnerships with institutions in Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Sint Maarten and Suriname.

Since the Open University was founded, more than 250,000 students have enrolled in courses. , approximately 15,000 students were enrolled at study or support centres in the Netherlands, including some residents of other countries.

== Aims ==
The Dutch government&#x27;s purpose in founding the Open University of the Netherlands was to make higher education accessible to anyone with the necessary aptitudes and interests, regardless of formal qualifications. The university aims to provide cost-effective education and to encourage innovation in Dutch higher education, in terms of both curriculum and teaching.

==Organisation==

=== Governance ===
The chairman of the Open University of the Netherlands since June 2016 is Arent van der Feltz, former vice president for corporate development, legal, regulatory and public affairs at Ziggo. His predecessor was Sander van den Eijnden.

=== Faculties ===
* Science: Environmental Sciences, Computer Science and Information Science
* Humanities
* Management
* Educational Sciences
* Psychology
* Law

In addition to this, the university has four expertise centres: 
* CAROU: guidance in the deployment of technological and social innovations through research projects and education in areas such as Smart City, Cyber Security, Smart Industry, Climate Change and Continuous Learning
* Cyber Science Center: in cooperation with and 
* NEIMED (Nederlands expertise en innovatiecentrum maatschappelijke effecten demografische krimp): an alliance with Maastricht University and Zuyd University of Applied Sciences

The Open University also has two support staff departments: the Department of Administration and the Department of Support Services. These provide services ranging from academic affairs to student administration.

<doc id="1046746" wikidata="Q1215959" url="?curid=1046746" title="Sharpe (TV series)">
<text>Sharpe is a British television drama series starring Sean Bean as Richard Sharpe, a fictional British soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, with Irish actor Daragh O&#x27;Malley playing his second in command, Patrick Harper. Sharpe and Harper are the heroes of the &quot;Sharpe&quot; series of novels by Bernard Cornwell; most, though not all, of the episodes are based on the books. Produced by Celtic Films and Picture Palace Films for the ITV network, the series was filmed mainly in Crimea, with recordings of other episodes in Turkey, England, Portugal and Spain. The two final episodes were filmed in Jaipur, India.

The series originally ran from 1993 to 1997. It consisted of fourteen episodes, each with a running time of around 100 minutes. In 2006, ITV premiered &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, a two-part adventure loosely based on his time in India, with Sean Bean continuing his role as Sharpe. Filming of &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Peril&quot;, also set in India, was produced by Celtic Film/Picture Palace in 2008. The first part was broadcast on ITV and UTV on 2 November 2008, with the second part shown a week later. &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot; and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Peril&quot; were broadcast in the US in 2010 as part of PBS&#x27;s Masterpiece Classic season. 

The complete series is available on VHS (excluding &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot; and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Peril&quot;), DVD, Blu-ray and iTunes. The Blu-ray and iTunes releases have been remastered in HD widescreen from the original filmstrips, with the former format available in a special collector&#x27;s edition box set.

==Plot summary==

At the beginning of the series, Richard Sharpe is a sergeant in the 95th Rifles serving in Portugal during the Peninsular War in 1809. When he single-handedly saves the life of General Sir Arthur Wellesley from three French cavalrymen, Wellesley gives Sharpe a battlefield commission, appointing him a lieutenant. Sharpe is placed in charge of a detachment of elite &quot;chosen men&quot; of the 95th Rifles. Patrick Harper eventually becomes his best friend and is promoted to sergeant and later sergeant major.

Wellesley and his various spymasters, first Major Michael Hogan, followed by Major Nairn, Major Mungo Monroe and Major General Ross, find Sharpe to be an extremely capable and cunning officer and give him progressively more important tasks. Despite their backing, he has to fight against the strong prejudice of aristocrats (who often owe their army positions to money and social connections rather than to military skill) against an uncouth commoner raised from the ranks. He makes a number of dangerous enemies, such as French Major Pierre Ducos and Colonel Sir Henry Simmerson, and encounters one from his prior service in India, Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill. Sharpe&#x27;s successes gain him steady promotion, and by the end of the Napoleonic Wars, at the Battle of Waterloo, he is promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel by joining the Prince William of Orange’s staff, at Wellington’s request.

Along the way, Sharpe has a number of romances. He marries the Spanish guerrilla leader Teresa Moreno, with whom he has a daughter. Teresa is killed by Hakeswill. Sharpe then marries Jane Gibbons, who deserts him, squanders his money, and takes a lover. He finally settles down with Lucille Castineau, a Frenchwoman who passes away some time after Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat. (However, according to The Starbuck Chronicles, another series of Cornwell books, she outlives Sharpe.)

==Casting==
Initially, Paul McGann was cast in the title role; however, two weeks into filming of the first episode in Ukraine, McGann injured his knee playing football and was forced to withdraw. When production started again a month later, Sean Bean was given the role because he was the only suitable replacement available at short notice.

The first actor cast was Daragh O&#x27;Malley as Harper. The character of Rifleman Harris, played by Jason Salkey, did not exist in the books and was created for the television series. The producers wanted a &quot;clever one&quot; and took inspiration from a real soldier who was illiterate but had dictated his own recollections of the war, which were published.

Some actors have played multiple roles in the series. Peter-Hugo Daly portrayed first Sergeant Rodd in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Gold&quot; and then Bickerstaff, another unruly sergeant who dislikes Sharpe. Julian Fellowes played Major Warren Dunnett in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot; and also the Prince Regent in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Regiment&quot;. Tony Haygarth was &quot;Marshal&quot; Pot-au-Feu in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Enemy&quot; and Sir Willoughby Parfitt in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Justice&quot;.

==Reception==
Cornwell dedicated the 12th book &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Battle&quot;, to Sean Bean and said &quot;When I write Sharpe these days, I hear Sean&#x27;s voice.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

&quot;Over the Hills &amp; Far Away: The Music of Sharpe&quot; was released in 1996 as a companion to the television series by Virgin Records. The recording features performances by various artists, including British folk musicians John Tams (who played the supporting role of &quot;Rifleman Daniel Hagman&quot; in the series and wrote or arranged much of its music) and Kate Rusby, composer Dominic Muldowney, and The Band and Bugles of the Light Division, performing traditional songs along with selections of original music from the programmes.

<text>Swarm robotics is the study of how to design independent systems of robots without centralized control. The emerging swarming behavior of robotic swarms is created through the interactions between individual robots and the environment. This idea emerged on the field of artificial swarm intelligence, as well as the studies of insects, ants and other fields in nature, where swarm behavior occurs.

Relatively simple individual rules can produce a large set of complex swarm behaviors. A key component is the communication between the members of the group that build a system of constant feedback. The swarm behavior involves constant change of individuals in cooperation with others, as well as the behavior of the whole group.

== Key Attributes of Robotic Swarms ==
The design of swarm robotics systems is guided by swarm intelligence principles, which promote fault tolerance, scalability, and flexibility. Unlike distributed robotic systems in general, swarm robotics emphasizes a large number of robots. While various formulations of swarm intelligence principles exist, one widely recognized set includes:
# Robots are autonomous.
# Robots can interact with the surroundings and give feedback to modify the environment.
# Robots possess local perceiving and communicating capabilities, such as wireless transmission systems, like radio frequency or infrared.
# Robots do not exploit centralized swarm control or global knowledge.
# Robots cooperate with each other to accomplish the given task.
Miniaturization is also key factor in swarm robotics, as the effect of thousands of small robots can maximize the effect of the swarm-intelligent approach to achieve meaningful behavior at swarm-level through a greater number of interactions on an individual level.

Compared with individual robots, a swarm can commonly decompose its given missions to their subtasks; a swarm is more robust to partial failure and is more flexible with regard to different missions.

== History ==
The phrase &quot;swarm robotics&quot; was reported to make its first appearance in 1991 according to Google Scholar, but research regarding swarm robotics began to grow in early 2000s. The initial goal of studying swarm robotics was to test whether the concept of stigmergy could be used as a method for robots to indirectly communication and coordinate with each other.

One of the first international projects regarding swarm robotics was the SWARM-BOTS project funded by the European Commission between 2001 and 2005, in which a swarm of up to 20 of robots capable of independently physically connect to each other to form a cooperating system were used to study swarm behaviors such as collective transport, area coverage, and searching for objects. The result was demonstration of self-organized teams of robots that cooperate to solve a complex task, with the robots in the swarm taking different roles over time. This work was then expanded upon through the Swarmanoid project (2006–2010), which extended the ideas and algorithms developed in Swarm-bots to heterogeneous robot swarms composed of three types of robots—flying, climbing, and ground-based—that collaborated to carry out a search and retrieval task.

== Applications ==
There are many potential applications for swarm robotics. They include tasks that demand miniaturization (nanorobotics, microbotics), like distributed sensing tasks in micromachinery or the human body. A promising use of swarm robotics is in search and rescue missions. Swarms of robots of different sizes could be sent to places that rescue-workers cannot reach safely, to explore the unknown environment and solve complex mazes via onboard sensors. Swarm robotics can also be suited to tasks that demand cheap designs, for instance mining or agricultural shepherding tasks.

=== Drone swarms ===

Drone swarms are used in target search, drone displays, and delivery. A drone display commonly uses multiple, lighted drones at night for an artistic display or advertising. A delivery drone swarm can carry multiple packages to a single destination at a time and overcome a single drone&#x27;s payload and battery limitations. A drone swarm may undertake different flight formations to reduce overall energy consumption due to drag forces.

Drone swarming can also introduce additional control issues connected to human factors and the swarm operator. Examples of this include high cognitive demand and complexity when interacting with multiple drones due to changing attention between different individual drones. Communication between operator and swarm is also a central aspect.

=== Military swarms ===
More controversially, swarms of military robots can form an autonomous army. U.S. Naval forces have tested a swarm of autonomous boats that can steer and take offensive actions by themselves. The boats are unmanned and can be fitted with any kind of kit to deter and destroy enemy vessels.

During the Syrian Civil War, Russian forces in the region reported attacks on their main air force base in the country by swarms of fixed-wing drones loaded with explosives.

=== Miniature swarms ===
Another large set of applications may be solved using swarms of micro air vehicles, which are also broadly investigated nowadays. In comparison with the pioneering studies of swarms of flying robots using precise motion capture systems in laboratory conditions, current systems such as Shooting Star can control teams of hundreds of micro aerial vehicles in outdoor environment using GNSS systems (such as GPS) or even stabilize them using onboard localization systems where GPS is unavailable. Swarms of micro aerial vehicles have been already tested in tasks of autonomous surveillance, plume tracking, and reconnaissance in a compact phalanx. Numerous works on cooperative swarms of unmanned ground and aerial vehicles have been conducted with target applications of cooperative environment monitoring, simultaneous localization and mapping, convoy protection, and moving target localization and tracking.

==== Acoustic swarms ====
In 2023, University of Washington and Microsoft researchers demonstrated acoustic swarms of tiny robots that create shape-changing smart speakers. These can be used for manipulating acoustic scenes to focus on or mute sounds from a specific region in a room. Here, tiny robots cooperate with each other using sound signals, without any cameras, to navigate cooperatively with centimeter-level accuracy. These swarm devices spread out across a surface to create a distributed and reconfigurable wireless microphone array. They also navigate back to the charging station where they can be automatically recharged.

==== Kilobot ====
Most efforts have focused on relatively small groups of machines. However, a Kilobot swarm consisting of 1,024 individual robots was demonstrated by Harvard in 2014, the largest to date. 

==== LIBOT ====
Another example of miniaturization is the LIBOT Robotic System that involves a low cost robot built for outdoor swarm robotics. The robots are also made with provisions for indoor use via Wi-Fi, since the GPS sensors provide poor communication inside buildings. 
==== Colias ====
Another such attempt is the micro robot (Colias), built in the Computer Intelligence Lab at the University of Lincoln, UK. This micro robot is built on a 4 cm circular chassis and is a low-cost and open platform for use in a variety of swarm robotics applications.

=== Manufacturing swarms ===
Additionally, progress has been made in the application of autonomous swarms in the field of manufacturing, known as swarm 3D printing. This is particularly useful for the production of large structures and components, where traditional 3D printing is not able to be utilized due to hardware size constraints. Miniaturization and mass mobilization allows the manufacturing system to achieve scale invariance, not limited in effective build volume. While in its early stage of development, swarm 3D printing is currently being commercialized by startup companies.

<doc id="1046765" wikidata="Q970324" url="?curid=1046765" title="Jan Tarnowski">
<text>Jan Amor Tarnowski (Latin: Joannes Tarnovius; 1488 – 16 May 1561) was a Polish nobleman, knight, military commander, military theoretician, and statesman of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. He was Grand Crown Hetman from 1527, and was the founder of the city of Tarnopol, where he built the Ternopil Castle and the Ternopil Pond. The first Count of the Holy Roman Empire in the Tarnowski family (1547).

==History==
Tarnowski was born in 1488, the son of Jan Amor Junior Tarnowski, castellan of Kraków, and his second wife Barbara of Rożnów, granddaughter of the knight Zawisza the Black. He was a scion of an important family clan started in the mid-14th century by Spycimir Leliwita, castellan of Kraków. Tarnowski had five half-siblings from his father&#x27;s first marriage: Jan Amor the Elder, Jan Aleksander (d. 1497), Katarzyna, Zofia and Elżbieta. He had also five half-sisters from his mother&#x27;s first marriage. He spent his earliest years in Rożnowo and Stare Sioło. He was originally intended to become a priest; but after his father&#x27;s death in 1500, his mentor Maciej Drzewiecki convinced Barbara of Rożnowo to abandon this plan. In 1501, Tarnowski was sent to the king&#x27;s court; but on 17 June 1501, king John I Albert died and he returned to Rożnowo, to his mother&#x27;s domain.

In 1508, Tarnowski fought against Muscovy in the battle of Orsza; in 1509, against Moldavia in the battle of Chocim, and upon the Dniester as a commander of his own &quot;chorągiew&quot; (banner/company). In 1512, he was involved in the battle of Łopuszna, in which the Tatars were defeated by the Polish forces.

He made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and in 1518 became a knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. He travelled extensively across Europe, and was knighted by king Manuel I of Portugal for his services against the Moors in Africa.

Tarnowski was the owner of Tarnów, Wiewiórka, Rożnów, Przeworsk, and Stare Sioło. In 1522, he became castellan of Wojnicz; in 1527, voivode of the Ruthenian Voivodeship; in 1535, voivode of the Kraków Voivodeship. In 1536, he became castellan of Kraków and starost of Sandomierz, Stryj, Żydaczów, Dolina, Sandecz, Chmielnów, Lubaczów and Horodło.

In 1521, he participated in the Ottoman–Habsburg wars. He was among the first Hetmans of the Polish Army after its great reforms. He led the Polish Army to many victories, among them the battles of Obertyn against the Moldavians in 1531, and seizing Starodub from the Muscovites and executing its defenders in 1535 during the Muscovite wars.

In 1545, the Archbishop of Gniezno, Piotr Gamrat, granted hetman Tarnowski a papal brief with indulgences and privileges granted by Pope Paul III in 1535, and in 1547 he was awarded by Emperor Charles V with a diploma of the counts of the Holy Roman Empire - this title was to apply to the hetman and his descendants.

Tarnowski developed, among other things, horse artillery, field hospitals financed by the government, headquarters services, and field sappers. Throughout his entire service as a hetman, he preached a doctrine of flexibility.

Poet Jan Kochanowski wrote a poem &quot;O śmierci Jana Tarnowskiego&quot; (&quot;On the death of Jan Tarnowski&quot;). He is also one of the characters depicted in Jan Matejko&#x27;s painting &quot;Prussian Homage&quot;.

==Family==
In about 1511, Tarnowski married Barbara Tęczyńska, daughter of Mikołaj Tęczyński, voivode of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. She was the niece of his mother&#x27;s first husband.
After her death, Tarnowski married Zofia Szydłowiecka in 1530. He had four children, among them Zofia Tarnowska and Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski.

<doc id="1046770" wikidata="Q747668" url="?curid=1046770" title="Asyndeton">
<text>Asyndeton (, ; from the , &quot;unconnected&quot;, sometimes called asyndetism) is a literary scheme in which one or several conjunctions are deliberately omitted from a series of related clauses. Examples include &quot;veni, vidi, vici&quot; and its English translation &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;. Its use can have the effect of speeding up the rhythm of a passage and making a single idea more memorable. Asyndeton may be contrasted with syndeton (syndetic coordination) and polysyndeton, which describe the use of one or multiple coordinating conjunctions, respectively.

More generally, in grammar, an asyndetic coordination is a type of coordination in which no coordinating conjunction is present between the conjuncts.

&quot;Quickly, resolutely, he strode into the bank.&quot;

No coordinator is present here, but the conjoins are still coordinated as adverbs applying to the same verb (&quot;strode&quot;). A syndetically coordinated rephrase of the sentence might be &quot;Quickly and resolutely, he strode into the bank.&quot;

== Examples ==

=== Omission of conjunction &quot;and&quot; ===

Aristotle wrote in his &quot;Rhetoric&quot; that this device was more effective in spoken oratory than in written prose:

*&quot;Thus strings of unconnected words, and constant repetitions of words and phrases, are very properly condemned in written speeches: but not in spoken speeches — speakers use them freely, for they have a dramatic effect. In this repetition there must be variety of tone, paving the way, as it were, to dramatic effect; e.g., &#x27;This is the villain among you who deceived you, who cheated you, who meant to betray you completely&#x27;&quot;. Aristotle, &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Book III, Chapter 12 (trans. W. Rhys Roberts).

Aristotle also believed that asyndeton can be used effectively in endings of works, and he himself employs the device in the final passage of the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;:
*&quot;For the conclusion, the disconnected style of language is appropriate, and will mark the difference between the oration and the peroration. &#x27;I have done. You have heard me. The facts are before you. I ask for your judgement&#x27;&quot;. Aristotle, &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Book III, Chapter 19 (trans. W. Rhys Roberts).

Several notable examples can be found in American political speeches:
*&quot;...and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth&quot;. Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address
*&quot;...that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.&quot; John F. Kennedy &quot;Inaugural Address&quot;, 20 January 1961.

Another frequently used example is Winston Churchill&#x27;s address, &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot;:

*&quot;We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. . .&quot;

=== Omission of conjunction &quot;or&quot; ===

He was dressed in a dusty frockcoat and carried a walking stick and he wore a pair of octagonal glasses on the one pane of which the late sun shone while a watery eye peered from the naked wire aperture of the other.&quot; (Cormac McCarthy, &quot;Outer Dark&quot;, 1968)

<doc id="1046772" wikidata="Q426492" url="?curid=1046772" title="Polysyndeton">
<text>Polysyndeton (from Ancient Greek πολύ &quot;poly&quot; &quot;many&quot; and συνδετόν &quot;syndeton&quot; &quot;bound together with&quot;) is the deliberate insertion of conjunctions into a sentence in order to slow the rhythm of the prose so as to produce an impressively solemn note.

In grammar, a polysyndetic coordination is a coordination in which all conjuncts are linked by coordinating conjunctions (usually &quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;nor&quot; in English).

==Examples==

In ancient Greek literature, authors such as Homer used polysyndeton to add rhythm, build tension, or create meaning and complexity to their works. For example, conjunctions like “και” (and) or “δε” (but) repeat frequently.

A passage from the Book of Genesis (1:24–25) gives an instance of the stately effect of polysyndeton: 

Author Ernest Hemingway employs the conjunction &quot;and&quot; to convey &quot;a flow and continuity of experience&quot; in a passage from his short story &quot;After the Storm&quot;:

The poet John Keats used conjunctions in a verse from &quot;Endymion&quot;:
==In the King James Bible==
Polysyndeton is used extensively in the King James Version of the Bible, where &quot;and&quot; is used as a literal translation of the Hebrew waw-consecutive and the Ancient Greek particle . For example:

* &quot;And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.&quot; (Genesis 7:22–24)
* &quot;Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.&quot; (Leviticus 5:2)
* &quot;And Joshua, and all of Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had.&quot; (Joshua 7.24)

== In Shakespeare ==
Shakespeare used polysyndeton:
* &quot;When thou dost ask me blessing I&#x27;ll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness. So we&#x27;ll live and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we&#x27;ll talk with them too&quot; (&quot;King Lear&quot; 5.3.11–5)
* &quot;Why, this is not a boon! &#x27;Tis as I should entreat you to wear your gloves, or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, or sue you to do a peculiar profit to your person&quot; (&quot;Othello&quot; 3.3.85–9)
* &quot;If there be cords, or knives, or poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I&#x27;ll not endure it&quot; (&quot;Othello&quot; 3.3.443–5)
* &quot;Though his face be better than any man&#x27;s, yet his leg excels all men&#x27;s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare&quot; (&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; 2.5.42–5)
* &quot;Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous-where is your mother?&quot; (&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; 2.5.59–61)

==Modern usage==
* &quot;There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway. Little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season, and of lobster shells in the lobster season, and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons, encroached upon its high places.&quot; (Charles Dickens, &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, 1848)
* &quot;Papa O. never knocked. He kicked the door in happily and shouted cheerfully, &#x27;What you say, all peoples? How&#x27;s t&#x27;ings, ever-body?&#x27; Papa O. pulled people out of bed and rattled pans and laughed at nothing and argued with unseen bartenders until somebody gave him sausage and eggs and coffee and bread and hung the accordion safely away.&quot; (Nelson Algren, &quot;How the Devil Came Down Division Street&quot;, 1944, in &quot;The Neon Wilderness&quot;, 1947)
* &quot;Let the whitefolks have their money and power and segregation and sarcasm and big houses and schools and lawns like carpets, and books, and mostly—mostly—let them have their whiteness.&quot; (Maya Angelou, &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, 1969)
* &quot;Nor was it there because the person had been killed, or maimed or caught or burned or jailed or whipped or evicted or stomped or raped or cheated, since that could hardly qualify as news in a newspaper.&quot; (Toni Morrison, &quot;Beloved&quot;, 1987)
* &quot;They crossed the river under a white quartermoon naked and pale and thin atop their horses. They&#x27;d stuffed their boots upside down into their jeans and stuffed their shirts and jackets after along with their warbags of shaving gear and ammunition and they belted the jeans shut at the waist and tied the legs loosely about their necks and dressed only in their hats they led the horses out onto the gravel spit and loosed the girthstraps and mounted and put the horses into the water with their naked heels.&quot; (Cormac McCarthy, &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;, 1992)

<text>The Northrop C-19 Alpha was a series of three aircraft purchased from Northrop by the US Army Air Corps in 1931. They were slightly modified versions of the civil Northrop Alpha Type 2.

==Design and development==
The YC-19 aircraft were Northrop Alpha 4s supplied for evaluation to the USAAC. No production orders were given. The major difference between the C-19s and the Alphas was that the civilian version carried a pilot and six passengers while the Army version carried a pilot and four passengers.

==Operational history==
One aircraft, the last of the three purchased, crashed between Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia on Sunday, March 19, 1933, killing its pilot and two passengers. The other aircraft were used for several more years until being sent to training schools as subjects for maintenance and repair classes.

==Variants==
;YC-19: one aircraft, previously an Alpha 4, serial number 31-516
;Y1C-19: two aircraft, serial numbers 31–517 to 31-518, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340-11 engine

<doc id="1046784" wikidata="Q2960406" url="?curid=1046784" title="The Red Skelton Show">
<text>The Red Skelton Show is an American television comedy/variety show that aired from 1951 to 1971. In the decade prior to hosting the show, Richard &quot;Red&quot; Skelton had a successful career as a radio and motion pictures star. Although his television series is largely associated with CBS, where it appeared for more than sixteen years, it actually began and ended on NBC. During its run, the program received three Emmy Awards, for Skelton as best comedian and the program as best comedy show during its initial season, and an award for comedy writing in 1961. In 1959 Skelton also received a Golden Globe for Best TV Show.

== Origins: 1950s ==
Red Skelton&#x27;s network television program began at the start of the 1951 fall season on NBC (for sponsor Procter &amp; Gamble). The MGM agreement with Skelton for television performances did not allow him to go on the air before September 30, 1951. After two seasons on Sunday nights, the program was picked up by CBS in the fall of 1953 and moved to Tuesday night, the time slot with which it would become primarily associated during most of its run. After his first CBS season the program was moved to Wednesday night and expanded to an hour for the summer of 1954 only; it was then reduced back to a half-hour for a time, later expanded again, returning to Tuesday night, where it would remain for the next sixteen years (co-sponsored by Johnson&#x27;s Wax and Pet Milk between 1955 and 1962).

The program was produced at Desilu Productions and CBS Television City in Hollywood, and over five years, from 1955 through 1960, was telecast in color approximately 100 times. In 1960, Skelton purchased the Chaplin studios, with plans to continue using the facility for his television show and for making films. It was the most colorcast of the few programs CBS aired in color during this period. By 1960, CBS no longer manufactured television sets (unlike its rival NBC&#x27;s parent company, RCA) and pulled the plug on colorcasts. With the exception of a few specials and some yearly broadcasts of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, CBS would not colorcast again on a regular basis until the 1965–66 fall season, when the network could no longer avoid public demand amidst rising sales in color television sets.

Skelton was infatuated with his appearance on color television, and he cajoled CBS to colorcast the program (In 1961, Skelton also invested in three rental remote vans which had full live, film, and color videotape capability). Although visionary, the venture in color was premature and, when it failed, CBS bought Skelton&#x27;s facilities (formerly Charlie Chaplin Studios) as part of renewing Skelton&#x27;s contract.

From 1956 to 1962, Sherwood Schwartz (later widely known for creating the popular sitcoms &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, among others) was head writer of Skelton&#x27;s show, for which Schwartz won an Emmy Award in 1961.

== Format during the 1960s ==
In September 1962, the program was again expanded to a full hour (becoming &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;) and remained in this longer format for the balance of its CBS run. The format of the program itself during this period was quite simple.

=== Pre-opening ===
This pre-opening format was changed slightly each year during the rest of the show&#x27;s CBS run, but followed this basic format.

Instead of a traditional opening title card, announcer Art Gilmore would intone, “From Television City in Hollywood,” and Skelton would perform a brief comedic blackout sketch, ending with the show&#x27;s resident vocal group (the Skeltones) singing the words &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot; (beginning in the 1964–65 season, Skelton would simply stand alone, smiling and waving at the camera, spotlighted on a darkened stage as the shot zoomed in (dressed in some seasons as one of his various characters), as Gilmore would announce the title, and (in later seasons) the singers sang the title), leading into a brief musical &quot;song and dance&quot; number (about 90 seconds long) performed in lyrical song by several smiling male and female dancers as they danced and moved cheerfully across the large stage. This introductory number would have a certain visual theme, such as gardening, college football, the signs of the zodiac, etc., and the set, the dancers’ costumes, and the lyrics of the dancers’ song would reflect the theme. After the dancers sang the first two stanzas, they continued the song, singing “our guest star…” followed by the guest&#x27;s name, matched with a camera shot of the guest (most evenings there was at least one major celebrity guest as well as a musical guest); “David Rose and his orchestra,” with a shot of Rose; the singers (originally the Modernaires; the Skel-tones by 1963; by the fall of 1964 as the Alan Copeland Singers (Copeland, the credited vocal arranger of the show, was originally a member of the Modernaires); and by the 1969–70 season as The Jimmy Joyce Singers and the dancers (introduced after 1964 as the Tom Hansen Dancers, after the show&#x27;s credited choreographer); and finally introducing Skelton as the star of the show; the assembled dancers looking &quot;stage left&quot; anticipating Skelton&#x27;s entrance on stage to begin his opening monologue.

For the final CBS season (1969–70), a cold open blackout sketch was added, featuring the antics of two alien moon men, green in color, performing comedic antics on the moon, as the song &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; was playing. This led immediately into the dancers&#x27; routine.

=== Opening monologue ===
After the opening song-and-dance routine, Skelton opened with a monologue. The monologue often lapsed into character humor, including &quot;Gertrude and Heathcliff, the Two Seagulls&quot;, which he performed by crossing his eyes and sticking his thumbs into his armpits for &quot;wings&quot;. (Johnny Carson, who was a writer on this program for a period, reminisced about writing for this spot.) Skelton performed the &quot;Doughnut Dunkers,&quot; one of his earliest signature routines, in a 1964 episode during this monologue.

=== Guest stars ===
This was followed by a guest-star performance, often a singer. Musical accompaniment was generally provided by the show&#x27;s orchestra and led by its well-known bandleader, David Rose. He was also the composer of the show&#x27;s familiar signature tune, &quot;Holiday for Strings&quot;(U.S. Copyright Registration Date 26-3-1942). The guest then appeared with Skelton in a comedy sketch. In other episodes, the Tom Hansen Dancers would perform another song-and-dance number, sometimes joined by the guest star.

Among the notable guest stars on the program were western film stars Amanda Blake and Roscoe Ates, who played a sheriff in the 1961 episode &quot;Candid Clem&quot;. John Wayne, Jack Benny, Phyllis Diller, George Raft, Martha Raye, Robert Vaughn, Audrey Meadows, Carol Lawrence, Shirley Bassey, Godfrey Cambridge and Carol Channing also made appearances. Popular television actress Phyllis Avery appeared twice in &quot;Clem&#x27;s Watermelons&quot; (1961) and &quot;Nothing But the Tooth&quot; (1962). Billy Gray, who played Bud Anderson Jr. on &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, guest starred after the former show ended its six-year run.

==== Musical guests ====
The Beach Boys made their network television debut as musical guests on a 1963 episode. The Rolling Stones videotaped three songs in London for a 1964 Skelton show. Another British Invasion band, The Kinks, appeared in early 1965 (shortly before the American Federation of Musicians banned them from touring in the US for the next four years). The Supremes and the Motown Sound visited the Skelton hour in 1965. Other musical guests included Bobby Rydell, the Lettermen, Vikki Carr, Horst Jankowski, Gloria Loring, the New Christy Minstrels, the Doodletown Pipers, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, the Association, Lulu, Johnny Mathis, Tom Jones, Matt Monro, Lou Rawls and Dionne Warwick.

=== Comedy sketches ===

The sketches were usually built around one of Red&#x27;s many characters, including &quot;Deadeye&quot;, an incredibly inept sheriff in the Old West; &quot;San Fernando Red&quot;, a shady real estate agent (named for the San Fernando Valley, which was still a largely rural area when the show began); &quot;Cauliflower McPugg&quot;, a punchdrunk boxer; &quot;George Appleby&quot;, a hen-pecked husband; &quot;Junior, the Mean Widdle Kid&quot; (whose trademark line was, &quot;If l dood it, l get a whippin&#x27;...l DOOD IT!&quot;), &quot;Clem Kadiddlehopper&quot;, a hick who was identified in at least one sketch as being from Cornpone County, Tennessee; and &quot;Freddie the Freeloader&quot;. Freddie, regarded by many as Skelton&#x27;s signature character, was a bum with a heart of gold, who was played by Skelton (and in one episode in 1961, by Ed Sullivan) in clown makeup reminiscent of Emmett Kelly but somehow not as sad. Freddie could be either a speaking character or totally pantomimed. While many of Skelton&#x27;s other characters originated on his radio shows, Freddie was created for television in 1952. Skelton&#x27;s father, Joseph, who died two months before his youngest son, Richard, was born, was once a clown for the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. Skelton, who had spent some time working for the same circus as a youth, copied his father&#x27;s clown makeup for Freddie. During the sketches, Skelton and the celebrity guest star would sometimes break character and make good-natured wisecracks at one another.

In its later years, the show generally finished with &quot;The Silent Spot&quot;, with Skelton pantomiming Freddie or another silent character. (It was hard for some younger viewers to accept that such an overwhelmingly visual, physical performer had once been a staple of radio.) After &quot;The Silent Spot&quot;, the show closed with Red looking into the camera and saying sincerely, &quot;Good night and may God bless.&quot;

The Tom Hansen Dancers would return in their costumes from the pre-opening song-and-dance number and invite the audience to join the show the following week, singing to the tune of &quot;Holiday for Strings&quot; as the closing credits appeared.

While the vast majority of Skelton&#x27;s skits were comedy, there were a few serious segments. One memorable segment came in 1969, when Skelton performed a self-written monologue about the Pledge of Allegiance, providing commentary on the meaning of each phrase of the Pledge. CBS received 200,000 requests for copies; the company subsequently released the monologue as a single recording by Columbia Records.

=== Skelton television characters ===
== Final years: 1970–1971 ==
CBS ended its association with the program in early 1970. This apparently marked the beginning of one of several attempts by CBS to downplay programming (even shows gaining relatively strong Nielsen ratings) whose primary appeal was to &quot;Middle America&quot;, an audience more rural and also somewhat older than that generally desired by network television advertisers. Marketers were moving towards a younger, &quot;hipper&quot; and more urban audience (see the Rural Purge). Skelton was reportedly heartbroken at the cancellation.

=== The move to NBC: 1970 ===
At least in part due to Skelton&#x27;s iconic status, the program was picked up by NBC in late 1970. However, the program that aired was quite different from the one that Skelton&#x27;s CBS audience was used to seeing. The new set was dark, devoid of the bright and colorful backdrops that viewers had seen on CBS. The show was cut back to its original half-hour length and it was moved from Tuesday to Monday nights.

But perhaps the biggest change was that the show began to incorporate &quot;regulars&quot; for the first time along with Skelton, Rose, and Rose&#x27;s orchestra. A repertory company of young, comic actors and actresses was added as well as veteran performers such as Eve McVeagh and The Burgundy Street Singers (previously seen after an abortive comeback on network television by 1950s folk singing star Jimmie Rodgers on ABC two years earlier.)

The new format never really worked; the audience sensed that there was little chemistry between Skelton and his repertory company. The program ended in March 1971, although selected programs from this final season were rerun on NBC on Sunday nights during mid-1971 by Procter &amp; Gamble, so it could be said that Skelton&#x27;s network television career had ended exactly where it had begun.

== Skelton&#x27;s later TV career ==
Skelton continued to make appearances for many years afterwards, increasingly as a nostalgic figure, but was never again a regular feature of network television programming. He was awarded the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Governors Award, a lifetime achievement award, in 1986. Skelton was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; Television Hall of Fame in 1989.

<text>Bernard Stanley Pearson (born 13 September, 1946) is a British potter, sculptor, and author. In 1981, Pearson helped to establish Clare Craft, a pottery company based in the Suffolk town of Clare. Clare Craft produced a variety of figurines, mostly centering around fantasy. Clare Craft designed multiple figurines based on characters from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels.

In 1997, at Pratchett’s suggestion, Pearson began crafting ‘The Unreal Estate’; a series of highly detailed architectural models based on Discworld locations, most notably the Unseen University. During this time, Pearson and his wife, Isobel, also created a wide range of studio pottery based on landscape and fantasy imagery under the back stamp of ‘Bernard Pearson Ceramics’.

In 2000, Pearson moved to the town of Wincanton in Somerset, England, where he established a Discworld centre and retail outlet called ‘The Cunning Artificer’, a name given to him by Terry Pratchett. Pearson his wife launched additional Discworld merchandise, including the ‘Discworld Stamps’. This collaboration with Terry Pratchett resulted in the creation of thousands of ‘Cinderella’ stamps that are held in private collections and even in the British Library. Pearson co-authored &quot;The Complete Discworld Almanack&quot; with Terry Pratchett in 2004. ‘The Cunning Artificer’ was renamed ‘The Discworld Emporium’ in 2011 when Ian Mitchell and Reb Voyce joined the partnership, setting up a successful online business shipping books and Discworld merchandise worldwide. Following the death of Terry Pratchett in 2015, Pearson assumed a more subsidiary role in the design and running of the Emporium.

In 2018, Pearson published his first novel, &quot;Dovetail&quot;, and has since continued to focus on writing. He published his second book, &quot;A Glastonbury Tale&quot;, in 2021.

<doc id="1046816" wikidata="Q3439432" url="?curid=1046816" title="List of Philadelphia Flyers players">
<text>The Philadelphia Flyers are a professional ice hockey team based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Eastern Conference. The Flyers were founded in 1967 as one of six expansion teams, increasing the size of the NHL at that time to 12 teams.

Since the franchise was established, the team has had 20 captains, including Bobby Clarke, who captained the Flyers to two Stanley Cups in 1973–74 and 1974–75, and is the only player to have scored over 1,000 points for the Flyers. Clarke was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player three times, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987. Thirteen other players who have appeared for the Flyers have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame: Bill Barber, Paul Coffey, Peter Forsberg, Dale Hawerchuk, Mark Howe, Eric Lindros, Adam Oates, Bernie Parent, Chris Pronger, Mark Recchi, Jeremy Roenick, Darryl Sittler and Allan Stanley. Six players have been honored by having their number retired by the Flyers: Barber, Clarke, Howe, Lindros, Parent and Barry Ashbee. Twenty-eight people have been inducted into the Flyers Hall of Fame since its establishment in 1988, of which twenty-three have been players.

In addition to leading the team in points both in the regular season and playoffs, Clarke also holds the records for the most appearances and most assists for the Flyers in both regular season and playoffs. Fellow Stanley Cup winner Barber has scored the most goals for the team with his 420 regular season and 53 playoff goals. Rick Tocchet spent the most time in the penalty box during the regular season for the Flyers, accruing 1,817 minutes in total, while Dave Schultz&#x27;s 363 penalty minutes are the most by a Flyer in the playoffs. Among goaltenders, Roman Cechmanek boasts the best goals against average and save percentage in the regular season (excluding Marc D&#x27;Amour and Robbie Moore, neither of whom made more than five appearances).

As of the completion of the 2023–24 NHL season, 65 goaltenders and 623 skaters (forwards and defensemen) have appeared in at least one regular season and/or playoff game with the Philadelphia Flyers since the team joined the league in the 1967–68 NHL season. The Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975 with a total of 26 players. Seventeen of them were part of both Stanley Cup winning rosters. The 688 all-time members of the Flyers are listed below, with statistics complete through the end of the 2023–24 season.

<doc id="1046818" wikidata="Q440657" url="?curid=1046818" title="Vin jaune">
<text>Vin jaune (French for &quot;yellow wine&quot;) is a special and characteristic type of white wine made in the Jura region in eastern France. It is similar to dry fino Sherry and gets its character from being matured in a barrel under a film of yeast, known as the &quot;voile&quot;, on the wine&#x27;s surface. &quot;Vin jaune&quot; shares many similarities with Sherry, including some aromas, but unlike Sherry, it is not a fortified wine. The wine is made from the Savagnin grape, with some of the most premium examples coming from the marl based vineyards in the Château-Chalon AOC. In other French wine regions, there has been experimentation in producing similar style wines from Chardonnay and other local grape varieties using cultured yeast such as the &quot;vin de voile&quot; wine produced in the Gaillac.

==Production==
Vin jaune is made from late harvest Savagnin grapes, a white variety in the Traminer family which is less aromatic than the better-known Gewürztraminer. The grapes are usually harvested in late October when the sugars have developed enough to have a potential alcohol level of 13–15% for the finished wine. The grapes are fermented slowly and then kept in small old oak casks that hold 228 liters (60 gallons). The casks are not topped up, as they are with most wines, so evaporation creates an air gap above the wine. A film of yeast grows over the wine, protecting it partially (but not totally) from oxidation. In Jura, this film is called the &quot;voile&quot; (veil), but it is similar to the &quot;flor&quot; familiar from Sherry production. The &quot;voile&quot; yeast has many similar properties to &quot;flor&quot; but thrives better in a lower alcohol environment and develops less heavily and thickly than &quot;flor&quot; does. 

The &quot;voile&quot; typically takes two to three years to develop fully. While the &quot;voile&quot; is incomplete, the wine is exposed to slight levels of oxidation that provoke chemical changes, producing acetaldehyde (as well as ethanol, standard alcohol) and sotolon, an aroma compound. These compounds contribute to the unique flavors and aromas associated with vin jaune. Winemakers must carefully observe the wine throughout the aging process as there is a risk of it developing the wine fault of volatile acidity. 

The wine acquires its characteristic yellow color and nutty flavors as it ages for the requisite time of six years and three months, the time that must elapse between harvest and bottling, although at certain points during this time the wine is not necessarily in the cask. After the allotted time, only about 62% of the original wine remains. The &quot;vin jaune&quot; is then bottled in special squat bottles that hold 62 cl (21 ounces), called &quot;clavelins&quot;. Historically the bottle size alludes to the amount of wine that remains from each litre after six years of aging and evaporation.

==Wine regions==

The &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; regions permitted to produce vin jaune include Château-Chalon AOC, Arbois Vin Jaune AOC, Cotes du Jura vin Jaune AOC and Vin Jaune de L&#x27;Etoile. Those protected &quot;appellations&quot; have existed since 1936. There are also a few other vin jaune-style wines made in France outside the Jura region, such as Gaillac. The term &quot;vin de voile&quot; referring to the yeast film, thus indicates this style of wine.

==Wine style and serving==
Vin jaune is often served at cellar temperature 13–15 °C (55–60 °F) and the wine is sometimes decanted, exposing it to more oxygen prior to serving in order to stimulate the wine&#x27;s unique aromas. The wine can be paired with savory food dishes with local Jura cuisine often including chicken recipes where the wine is cooked with the chicken itself and as a sauce component. Another common pairing is the local Comté cheese that is produced in the Franche-Comté region.

==La Percée du Vin Jaune==
A festival called &quot;La Percée du Vin Jaune&quot; (Opening of the Yellow Wine) is held in the last week of January or the first week of February each year to celebrate release of the newly released vintage, which due to the legal requirements for aging will be the one harvested in the autumn seven years earlier. Recent events, including tasting sessions, have attracted over 30,000 visitors. Each year, a different venue is chosen. They are as follows:

* 1997 : Poligny
* 1998 : Arbois
* 1999 : Château-Chalon and Voiteur
* 2000 : L&#x27;Étoile
* 2001 : Gevingey
* 2002 : Montigny-lès-Arsures
* 2003 : Arlay
* 2004 : Cramans
* 2005 : Saint-Lothain
* 2006 : Lons-le-Saunier
* 2007 : Salins-les-Bains
* 2008 : Vincelles
* 2009 : Passenans and Frontenay 
* 2010 : Poligny
* 2011 : Arbois
* 2012 : Ruffey-sur-Seille
* 2013 : Voiteur
* 2014 : Perrigny and Conliège
* 2015 : Montigny-lès-Arsures
* 2016 : Lons-le-Saunier
* 2017 : Not held
* 2018 : L&#x27;Étoile
* 2019 : Poligny
* 2020 : Ruffey-sur-Seille
* 2021 : Not held (Covid-19)
* 2022 : Cramans
* 2023 : Voiteur
* 2024 : Arbois

== Chemical composition ==
Vin jaune is marked by the formation of sotolon from alpha-ketobutyric acid.

==Connection with medieval wines==
Vin jaune has been found to be produced from grapes that possess identical DNA to grape seeds unearthed in archaeological digs of medieval sites.

<text>Frank Árpád Darabont (born Ferenc Árpád Darabont, January 28, 1959) is an American screenwriter, director, and producer. 

He has been nominated for three Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. In his early career, he was primarily a screenwriter for such horror films as &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987), &quot;The Blob&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Fly II&quot; (1989). As a director, he is known for his film adaptations of Stephen King novellas and novels, such as &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Mist&quot; (2007).

Darabont also developed and executive-produced the first season and first half of the second season of the AMC horror drama series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (2010–2011).

== Early life ==
Darabont was born in a refugee camp in 1959 in Montbéliard, France. His parents had fled Hungary for France after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, bringing his five brothers and four sisters, and three cousins. When Darabont was still an infant, his family immigrated to the United States, settling in Chicago before moving to Los Angeles when Darabont was five.

Darabont was inspired in his youth to pursue a career in film after seeing the George Lucas film &quot;THX 1138&quot;. Darabont graduated from Hollywood High School in 1977 and did not attend college. 

His first job after finishing school was working at the famed Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. He served at the concession stand and as an usher, and was grateful for the perk of getting to watch numerous films for free. He claims he developed his writing skills from &quot;endless hours&quot; of writing at a desk on a typewriter in his free time, and from his childhood friend Cody Hills.

== Career ==

=== Early works ===
Darabont became involved in filmmaking by becoming a production assistant on such films as &quot;Hell Night&quot;, &quot;The Seduction&quot;, and &quot;Trancers&quot;. The first film he wrote and directed was a short work adapted from Stephen King&#x27;s story &quot;The Woman in the Room&quot;. This film was one of the first &quot;Dollar Babies&quot; and made the semi-finalist list for Academy Award consideration in 1983. Although Darabont was not happy with how the short turned out, this effort resulted in a close association with King, who granted him the &quot;handshake deal&quot; rights to another of his shorter works, &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; from the collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot;.

Darabont sold his first screenplay titled &quot;Black Cat Run&quot; in 1986, but it was not produced for more than a decade, as a television film under the same name. Darabont was approached by Chuck Russell (who was a producer on &quot;Hell Night&quot; and &quot;The Seduction&quot;) with an offer to become his writing partner, as he had become interested in Darabont&#x27;s writing after reading his spec script written for the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. 

The two began working on a script for a remake of the film &quot;The Blob&quot;, which they had planned to shop around to studios. That was interrupted when they were both hired to rewrite the script of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, with Russell directing the film. The two were given only two weeks to rewrite the script and accomplished it in ten days. The success of their &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film allowed them to produce the first script they had originally written, &quot;The Blob&quot;. By then considered a successful writer for hire, Darabont was commissioned to write &quot;The Fly II&quot;, an early draft of &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, and an unproduced sequel to &quot;Commando&quot;.

Darabont made his directorial debut with &quot;Buried Alive&quot;, a television movie with a $2,000,000 budget that aired on the USA Network in 1990. He followed this with an extended run as a writer for George Lucas&#x27;s television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. He also wrote two episodes of the television series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;.

=== &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994) ===

Darabont made good on the deal with Stephen King by writing and directing the film adaptation of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. Rob Reiner, who had previously adapted another King novella, &quot;The Body&quot;, into the movie &quot;Stand by Me,&quot; offered Darabont $2.5 million in an attempt to write and direct &quot;Shawshank&quot;. He planned to cast Tom Cruise in the part of Andy and Harrison Ford as Red. Darabont seriously considered and liked Reiner&#x27;s vision, but he ultimately decided it was his &quot;chance to do something really great&quot; by directing the film himself.

Although the film did not fare well at the box office, it was met with acclaim by audiences and critics. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay for Darabont. The film attracted additional viewers after its Academy Award nominations, and became the most rented film of 1995. Today it is considered by many to be one of the greatest films ever made.

=== &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) ===

Darabont&#x27;s next directorial effort was another Stephen King adaptation for which he wrote the screenplay, &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, starring Tom Hanks. At first Darabont was reluctant to adapt the novel as a film, as its setting was too similar to &quot;Shawshank&quot;, but quickly changed his mind after reading the novel. Hanks and Darabont first met at an Academy Award luncheon in 1994, and the two were eager to work on a project together. Stephen King said he had envisioned Hanks in the role and was happy when Darabont mentioned his name.

The film was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture, and Darabont was nominated for his second Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. This was originally the highest-grossing film based on a Stephen King novel, as it made a total of $286,801,374 worldwide (before being surpassed by 2017&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; when it made $603 million worldwide.)

=== &quot;The Majestic&quot; (2001) ===

In 2001 Darabont directed the film &quot;The Majestic&quot;, starring Jim Carrey, Martin Landau, and Laurie Holden. He worked with these actors frequently throughout his career. Michael Sloane, whom Darabont had known since high school, wrote the script. This film is one of the few which Darabont directed, but did not write the screenplay. Darabont wanted to direct the film as he saw it as a &quot;love letter&quot; to works of Frank Capra and all the other movies he has loved throughout his life. The film received mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box-office, recouping only half of its $72 million budget internationally.

=== &quot;The Mist&quot; (2007) ===

Darabont had originally wanted to direct &quot;The Mist&quot; even before he directed &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, but kept pushing it back. It was 2004 before he began to write the screenplay for the film. Most of the crew that worked on the film had worked on the television series &quot;The Shield&quot;, as Darabont hired them after directing an episode of the series. He thought they could help give the film a &quot;more fluid, ragged documentary kind of direction&quot;. 

Darabont also helped create the designs of the creatures in the film, along with artists Jordu Schell, Bernie Wrightson, and the film&#x27;s lead makeup artist Greg Nicotero. CafeFX was hired to do the film&#x27;s special effects after Darabont asked fellow director Guillermo del Toro who did the effects on his film &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;.

The film was a modest success at the box office, but earned positive reviews from critics. King also praised Darabont&#x27;s new ending, saying, &quot;The ending is such a jolt—wham! It&#x27;s frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don&#x27;t necessarily want to be sent out with a Pollyanna ending.&quot; When a two-disc edition of the DVD was released, it included an exclusive black-and-white presentation of the film, the way Darabont had always intended it to be.

=== &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (2010–2011) ===
Darabont developed and executive-produced the first season of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, the AMC series based on Robert Kirkman&#x27;s comic book of the same name. Darabont recalled that he had first come across the series in 2005, in a comic book store in Burbank, California. When Darabont became interested, creator Kirkman called it &quot;extremely flattering&quot;. He said that Darabont &quot;definitely cares about the original source material, and you can tell that in the way he&#x27;s adapting it.&quot; 

Darabont first initiated a deal with NBC for &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, but was later declined. He eventually brought it to AMC, who picked it up based on the source material and Darabont&#x27;s involvement. Darabont wrote and directed the pilot and was executive producer of the first season, along with Gale Anne Hurd. The series features a number of actors who have regularly worked with Darabont in the past, including Jeffrey DeMunn, Laurie Holden and Melissa McBride. The series earned positive reviews upon release and the pilot attracted 5.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched series premiere episode of any AMC television series.

In July 2011, Darabont was fired from the position as showrunner. Initial reports suggested that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series; however, it was later confirmed that he was fired due to AMC&#x27;s desire to reduce the show&#x27;s budget (twice as many episodes for 20% less of a budget) and to his strained relationship with the executives of AMC. In 2016 Darabont and his agents from the Creative Artists Agency filed a lawsuit against AMC, seeking more than $280 million in unpaid profits. By July 2021, AMC had settled with Darabont and the CAA, agreeing to pay and future royalty payments.

=== &quot;Mob City&quot; (2013) ===

Not too long after leaving &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, Darabont struck a deal with TNT to develop a pilot for a new series to air on their channel, titled &quot;L.A. Noir&quot;, based on a book by author John Buntin. Darabont discovered the book at LAX Airport and, after two days straight of reading it, decided to adapt it for television. Darabont was very passionate about the project as he had always wanted to produce a film noir. 

Darabont cast Jon Bernthal, whom he had worked with on &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, in the lead role for the series. Other Darabont regulars cast included Jeffrey DeMunn and Alexa Davalos. The series was given a full season order of six episodes in the fall of 2012 and the title of the series was changed to &quot;Mob City&quot;. The series premiered in December 2013 and was met with mixed to positive reviews. The series was cancelled after one season.

=== Other work ===
Darabont also held the rights to two other Stephen King stories, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; and &quot;The Monkey&quot;, neither of which he ever adapted.

Darabont was a script doctor for the Steven Spielberg films &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot;. In 2002, he wrote an early draft of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. While Spielberg reportedly loved it, George Lucas rejected it. He also produced the 2002 film &quot;The Salton Sea&quot;, starring Val Kilmer and Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio.

Over the years Darabont has reunited with his old writing partner Chuck Russell. He did a rewrite for Russell&#x27;s film &quot;Eraser&quot;, they attempted to adapt a film of the 1930s pulp character, Doc Savage, and the two wrote an early treatment and were executive producers on the film &quot;Collateral&quot;.

He has also tried to produce film adaptations of the novels &quot;Mine&quot; by Robert R. McCammon and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; by Ray Bradbury. Darabont still hopes to make both films someday.

The same year &quot;Shawshank&quot; was released, &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot;, which Darabont wrote, was also released. The film was met with mixed reviews and Darabont called it the worst experience in his career as a writer as he had considered it the best script he had ever written, but that director Kenneth Branagh ruined it &quot;every step of the way&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;you can&#x27;t really judge the script based on what you saw on the screen. It got rephrased and messed with every inch of the way.&quot; Guillermo del Toro has shown interest in adapting Darabont&#x27;s draft of the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; script when he gets around to filming his own version of the story, calling the draft a &quot;near perfect&quot; adaptation of the original book.

In 2004, he was hired by Tom Cruise to write &quot;&quot;, but the script was later rewritten by J. J. Abrams, who directed the film. The same year, Darabont wrote the introduction for the Hellboy novel, &quot;Hellboy: Odder Jobs&quot; by Christopher Golden.

In 2005, Cemetery Dance Publications published Darabont&#x27;s novella &quot;Walpuski&#x27;s Typewriter&quot; in a limited edition. The story, originally written in his early twenties, first appeared in Jessie Horsting&#x27;s magazine &quot;Midnight Graffiti&quot;.

In 2007, Darabont directed an episode of &quot;The Shield&quot; titled &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot;. He also directed and executive produced the pilot episode of &quot;Raines&quot;, starring Jeff Goldblum.

Darabont appeared in &quot;First Class Jerk&quot;, the October 26, 2008, episode of &quot;Entourage&quot; in which he propositions Vincent Chase to star in a TV show he is executive producing. He appeared in a September 12, 2009, episode where he is now the director of the film about Enzo Ferrari, who Vince is portraying.

According to the &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion&quot; series by Titan Books, Darabont—a huge fan of the re-imagined series—was slated to direct &quot;Islanded in a Stream of Stars&quot;, the penultimate episode of the show&#x27;s final season. Due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to take the job, which fell to series star (and previous helmer) Edward James Olmos.

Darabont was slated to direct the 2009 film &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot;, but left production due to creative differences with the producers.

At the 2012 Austin Film Festival, Darabont was awarded the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award for his contribution to cinema.

In 2013, he lent his voice to a lengthier version of the &quot;World War Z&quot; audio book. In November of the same year Bob Weinstein revealed that he and Darabont were developing a ten part television series based on Darabont&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;The Mist&quot;.

Darabont was hired to rewrite the script for the 2014 &quot;Godzilla&quot; reboot. Darabont stated that he would like to bring the monster back to his origins as a &quot;terrifying force of nature.&quot; The director of the film Gareth Edwards stated in an interview that Darabont wrote the most moving scene of the film and that particular scene helped convince cast members Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche to sign onto the film.

In June 2014, it was reported that Darabont was on the shortlist to direct &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot;, a sequel to the fantasy film &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot;. A month later it was confirmed that Darabont would direct the film, but it would not be a sequel, but a prequel focusing on Chris Hemsworth&#x27;s character Eric, the Huntsman. However, Darabont left the project in January 2015, citing creative differences as the cause.

Darabont revealed in a 2021 interview with Mick Garris that he had recently written a script for a film centred around the American Civil War, based on an unproduced screenplay by filmmaker Stanley Kubrick and historian Shelby Foote that Ridley Scott was attached to produce. Darabont considers the script to be the best thing he has ever written and was dismayed when the film was unable to find financing.

== Recurring collaborators ==
In addition to collaborating with actors on films and television projects, Darabont has collaborated with writers, producers, composers, and others. These include Chuck Russell, Mark Isham, Stephen King, Gregory Nicotero, Rohn Schmidt, David Tattersall, and others. Jeffrey DeMunn appeared in &quot;The Blob&quot; and &quot;Black Cat Run&quot;, both of which Darabont wrote, Alexa Davalos appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Raines&quot; that he directed and Amin Joseph first worked with Darabont on an episode of &quot;The Shield&quot; titled &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot;.

&quot;The Woman in the Room&quot; (1983 film) and &quot;Buried Alive&quot; (1990) are not listed due to lack of collaborations (although Brian Libby appears in both).

<text>Sir Robert de Herle was an English military commander who was Admiral of all the Fleets about England and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports during the mid-14th century.

==Personal==

He was the son of William de Herle (Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas intermittently between 1327–37 and one of the king&#x27;s council until his death in 1364).

==Early career==

Robert de Herle became an important official in the earl of Warwick&#x27;s administration of the West Midlands, becoming his most senior official for at least the decade beginning after 1339.

Robert was overlord at the Leicestershire village of Kirby Muxloe, but more significantly became one of Thomas, the earl of Warwick&#x27;s most prominent retainers and was granted a life indenture at Wadborough.

During the 1340–50s all legal settlements in Warwickshire were subject to the goodwill of Thomas, earl of Warwick, who has been called &#x27;the most powerful lay figure in the West Midlands&#x27;, at the time. The earl&#x27;s absolute control over Warwickshire&#x27;s administration caused a large number of people to depart the county, not &#x27;willing to be judged by&#x27; the earl, or his officials, chief amongst, them being de Herle. In February 1345, de Herle was required by the king, along with others in the administration &#x27;to provide a list of those who were refusing to be judged by him&#x27;.

Shortly thereafter, in the July 1345 he was in the group Warwick had entrusted some of his lands to, as marriage settlements for his daughters. In 1355 and 1357 Sir Robert Herle fought in the Scottish Campaign where he received substantial rewards for the return of a number of prisoners.

Herle was one of the ‘bachelors’ of Warwick&#x27;s household during times of peace, and was required to attend the earl at tournaments and in the event of war.

Warwick granted Herle the wardenship of Barnard Castle along with its forests and lands, this, it has been stated made Herle a pivotal figure in the running of the earl&#x27;s estates. Herle&#x27;s was further granted a lifetime lease on several lands and rents in the vicinity of the Castle.

&quot;&quot;In September 1343, Herle obtained a pardon of the king&#x27;s suit for homicides, felonies, robberies and larcenies perpetrated by him and any consequent outlawries, and it is noted that the pardon was sealed personally in front of Edward III and Thomas, earl of Warwick.&quot;

Robert Herle was associated with the Bassett family of Drayton in 1339 as retainer to the Bassett manors of Moulton, Buckby, Olney and Walsall.

==Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports==

Until now all lists state that the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports for the year 1361 was Sir Richard de Herle, this was however not the case and in fact the appointment was granted to Sir Robert Herle. No evidence has been found in this short study for the existence of a Richard, and I conclude this to be an age old error now rectified.

&quot;By November of 1360 he is described as the ‘king&#x27;s lieutenant in Brittany’, whilst a year later he was referred to as the ‘king&#x27;s admiral’, and was Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque ports.&quot;&quot; (see ref. below).

In addition from November 1354, Robert Herle acted for the king as the steward of the lands and castles of the king&#x27;s sons, Edmund and John.

In addition to his long service to the earl of Warwick, during the later years of the 1340s Herle also became an important agent of the Crown and an officer of the king&#x27;s household. He continued his service for, and close association with the earl of Warwick, who was instrumental in Herle&#x27;s career, and is found named on a number of Warwick&#x27;s most important charters between 1350–60.

==Senior naval command==
He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the English Navy from 2 December 1360 - 7 July 1364 with the title of Admiral of the Kings Southern, Northern and Western Fleets.

<text>Jo Benkow (born Josef Elias Benkowitz; 15 August 1924 – 18 May 2013) was a Norwegian politician and writer, notable for being an important person in the Conservative Party of Norway, and the President of the Parliament 1985–1993. He was also President of the Nordic Council in 1983.

== Private life ==
Jo Benkow was born in Trondheim, Norway to Jewish parents, Ivan Benkow (1885–1955) and Annie Louise Florence (1895–1942). The family moved to the municipality of Bærum outside Oslo when Jo was a child. Jo Benkow married Bjørg Gerda Folkestad (1930–2012) in 1952, but the marriage dissolved in 1983. From 1985 he was married to fellow politician Annelise Høegh (1948–2015), former parliamentary representative for the Conservative Party, and daughter of war aviator Anders Høegh (1920– 1989). He was the uncle of journalistic fraudster Bjørn Benkow (1940–2010).

As a member of the tiny Jewish minority of Norway, he experienced first-hand prejudice while growing up. In 1942, he fled persecution by the Nazis occupying Norway, to Sweden. His mother and sister were deported by the Nazi regime from Norway and murdered in Auschwitz. Jo reached the United Kingdom where he served in the Royal Norwegian Air Force. He returned after the war and took up photography as a trade, his father&#x27;s profession.

==Political career==
In 1965 he was elected to the Parliament of Norway, representing the Conservative Party. In parliament he soon became a leading figure, as party leader 1980–84, group leader of the Conservative Party in parliament 1981–85 and most notably becoming President of the Storting (Speaker) on 9 October 1985, a position he held until his retirement on 30 September 1993, after 28 years in parliament.

Benkow served as president of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, taught international relations at Boston University, and has written books on human rights, modern monarchy in Norway, and other issues. His autobiography
&quot;Fra Synagogen til Løvebakken&quot; (&quot;From the synagogue to Løvebakken&quot;; Løvebakken refers to a place outside the Parliament) published in 1985 sold 250,000 copies in Norway and earned him the Norwegian Booksellers&#x27; Prize. His book &quot;Olav&quot; – &quot;menneske og monark&quot; (&quot;Olav – Man and Monarch&quot;), a product of several conversations with his friend King Olav V, was a huge bestseller as well.

He was also a much sought-after lecturer on issues concerning the Middle East and Anti-Semitism. In recent years he managed to create some controversy when he criticized former prime minister and party colleague Kåre Willoch, calling him &quot;the most biased person in the country,&quot; on account of Willoch&#x27;s views on the Middle East and his criticism of Israeli politics.

Benkow died on 18 May 2013, at a hospital in Oslo, aged 88.

<text>Beechingstoke is a small village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. It lies in the Vale of Pewsey about west of Pewsey and the same distance east of Devizes. The parish includes the hamlet of Broad Street and the northern part of the village of Bottlesford.

The River Avon and its small tributaries form parts of the west, south and northeast boundaries of the parish.

== History ==
Marden Henge, a large Neolithic earthwork, is just over the south-west border of the parish. The Domesday Book of 1086 records a manor called &quot;Bichenestock&quot;, with 14 households and one mill, held by Shaftesbury Abbey. In 1541 the king transferred the land to the Dean of Winchester, who held it until 1845.

The house known as The Manor (previously Stoke Manor), at the east end of the village, has a west wing from the early 18th century and a later west wing, both in brick under thatched roofs. Stoke Farmhouse, in the centre of the village, is from 1820–1840, in brick and slate with a cast iron porch.

In 1862 the Reading to Taunton railway was built close to Beechingstoke village and became the northern boundary of the parish. There was a station at , just outside the parish to the north of Broad Street, but it closed in 1966 making the nearest station.

==Parish church==
The earliest known record of the Church of England parish church of Saint Stephen is from 1291. Of the mediaeval church building, only the 14th-century chancel arch and surrounding wall survive. The nave was rebuilt in 1693 and the chancel in 1791. In 1848 the 1791 east window was moved to Wilsford school and a new 15th-century style one made by Wailes was inserted in the chancel in its place. The church was largely rebuilt again in 1861 under the direction of the architect S.B. Gabriel of Bristol, who altered the east window to a 14th-century style and inserted a new west window. The church is Grade II listed, as is the nearby Old Rectory of c. 1830.

Rectors include Edward Tufnell (1846 to 1858), who was later the first bishop of Brisbane, Australia. The benefice was held in plurality with that of Woodborough with Manningford Bohune from 1951, and in 1961 the benefices were united. Wilcot, Huish and Oare were added to the union in 1972 and a team ministry established; today Beechingstoke is part of the Vale of Pewsey group of churches.

==Local government==
Beechingstoke is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

==Amenities==
There is no school in the parish. A National school was built near the church shortly before 1859 but closed around 1872 when the school at nearby Woodborough was opened.

<doc id="1046850" wikidata="Q7358736" url="?curid=1046850" title="Roger Northwode">
<text>Sir Roger de Northwode (c. 1230 – 9 November 1286) held the posts of Warden of the Cinque Ports and Baron of the Exchequer.

He was a son of Sir Stephen de Northwode, Knight and his wife, Joan. Both parents were born before 1178. He may have been born earlier than 1230, possibly circa 1215. He married twice: first to Bona (probably de Waltham) and second to Juliana.

Some confusion exists over when he received his knighthood, as it is cited that in September 1265, when he served as steward of the Archbishop of Canterbury, he was also &quot;a knight commissioned in Kent to take the lands of the rebels into the king&#x27;s hands&quot;.

It has also been stated that (again) in September, but of 1275, he received his knighthood. Therefore, he was knighted sometime between September 1265–75; this much is certain, and he was thereafter commissioned on numerous public services. Specifically he was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and held this office until about the turn of 1259. He was also Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports after 1255 but before 1258 when he was replaced by Nicholas de Moels.

De Northwode &#x27;took an interest in the old monastery of St. Sexburge for it had been long neglected. He made many repairs and donated to the monastery, &quot;wherefore among the servants of God, he is to this day called the restorer of that house.&quot;&#x27;

<text>Patani is a coastal region in North Maluku, Indonesia, located on the eastern peninsula of Halmahera. Tepeleo is the biggest town in the area which is located within the Central Halmahera Regency. The area is perhaps most well known for its high-quality nutmeg, although cocoa, copra, palm oil and coconut crab are known to be produced in the region.

The area is subject to large-scale mining and industrial farming, where the general population typically engage in fishing, subsistence farming and tourism (due to the widespread natural beauty). It is generally understood that education, employment and wealth can only be found by leaving the area to pursue educational opportunities elsewhere due to the low levels of local education, wealth and the lack of local post-education pathways.

The Sultan of Tidore is thought to have social influence over this area where the area was absorbed into the Tidore Kingdom in the 6th century. As a consequence, the general population is overwhelmingly understood to identify as Islamic, although Islam is typically interwoven with pre-Islamic traditional cultural and religious practices. There is thought to be widespread suspicion to outsiders due to the past religious conflict in the early 2000s.</text><links>

<doc id="1046863" wikidata="Q893139" url="?curid=1046863" title="Boot image">
<text>A boot image is a type of disk image that when on a boot device allows the associated computer to boot. 

A boot image usually includes an operating system, utilities, diagnostics, boot and data recovery information and applications used organization-wide. A specialized image for a particular department or type of user may be called a &quot;departmental boot image&quot;. Building such an image can take days or weeks, and involve complex decisions about licensing and permissions - including which passwords to store in the boot image and which to require users to type in - and requires experts in software integration to do.

However, once built, the boot image can be simply copied onto devices, patched within reasonable limits, and remains disposable in case of any problems (viruses in particular). This is possible because unlike other hard drive images (which may contain any data, et al.), pure boot images contain no mission-critical data. By definition a pure boot image contains no data that cannot be reproduced from configurations or off-the-shelf executables. In particular end-user data is not part of a boot image, although some operating systems require that a copy of user preferences or configuration files be kept within the boot image itself, e.g. Microsoft Windows registry. Utilities like Norton Ghost keep a backup copy of the boot image, for quick re-imaging (often called re-installation) in the event of a problem, thus avoiding the need to diagnose a specific problem with a specific machine.

== As virtual machine ==
Some virtual machine infrastructure can directly import and export a boot image for direct installation to &quot;bare metal&quot;, i.e. a disk. This is the standard technique for OEMs to install identical copies of an operating system on many identical machines: The boot image is created as a virtual machine and then exported, or created on one disk and then copied via a boot image control infrastructure that also makes virtual machine copies. The VMware vCenter Converter for instance lets users &quot;convert physical machines to virtual machines - for free&quot; as part of that company&#x27;s suite of products to make images easier to back up and manage. Equivalents exist for Xen and other VM systems.

== Goals ==
By keeping the boot image entirely separate and disposable, and mandating boot image control, organizations seek to keep their total cost of operations (including its total cost of ownership component) low. Often such organizations look at uptime as a service.

One goal of boot image control is to minimize the number of boot images used by an organization to reduce support costs. It includes at least:
* Specifying the machine hardware to minimize unneeded machine diversity and minimize the resultant number of boot images.
* Upgrading new machine specifications at low additional cost ensures that they will remain useful long past their normal life. Extending the life of desktop machines will reduce the incursion of off-spec machines later in the life-cycle, improving standardization, reducing support costs, minimizing e-waste.
* Organizing the network so that boot images can be efficiently supported, independent of data. Data must not be dependent on boot devices. Use networks to store data on secure servers.
* Hardware acceptance testing on each new machine confirms that it is fit for use in a standardized boot image environment.
* Boot image installation to ensure that only supportable standardized boot images are used.
* Troubleshooting and help desk functions employ standardized tests to identify the source of problems: boot, software, or hardware.
* Desktop system recovery tools and procedures for failed desktop units. These would use backup copies of a boot image created with utilities such as Norton Ghost. In a large organization with many compatible machines, rapid recovery by replacing with a backup boot image may only take a few minutes, with considerable cost savings.
* Data backup and recovery procedures ensure data is stored in the right place so that it can be recovered promptly in crisis situations.
* Installing services for the disabled with a single boot image in a manner that is ubiquitous and cost effective, meeting the needs of all staff regardless of disability, with available technology services.
* Remote work and secure off-site system access procedures.
* Facilitating worker transfer by changing boots or authorizations instead of moving machines.
* Using thin clients for off-spec machines to eliminate the need for special boot images.

Many organizations use thin clients for applications which require high security, involve unreliable users or repurpose older machines for continued use.

A cascading strategy involves re-imaging older, off-spec machines to thin client boot images so that they may continue in use for some less demanding or more access-controlled applications.

<doc id="1046869" wikidata="Q749853" url="?curid=1046869" title="Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato">
<text>The Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato is a grand tourer sports car designed by Zagato and produced between 1960 and 1963. Introduced in October 1960 at the London Motor Show, it was effectively a DB4 GT, lightened and improved by the Zagato factory in Italy, by Ercole Spada. Initially, the factory planned to produce 25 cars, but demand was not as strong as expected and production was reduced to 19.

Growing popularity of the original DB4 GT Zagato resulted in two subsequent waves of cars based on DB4s being rendered into &quot;Zagatos&quot; through the cooperation of Aston Martin and the Zagato works in Italy. They are known as &quot;Sanction II&quot; and &quot;Sanction III&quot; cars. Also, an unauthorised industry of modifying original DB4 GTs into &quot;Zagato&quot; replicas has arisen.

== Specification ==

=== Engine ===
Although the specification of the engine was changed and upgraded throughout their racing history, the Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato predominantly featured a 3.7-litre aluminium twin-spark straight 6-cylinder engine with a 9.7:1 compression ratio, higher than the DB4 GT engine.

The engine produced , and had a 0 to acceleration of 6.1 seconds and a top speed of approximately .

=== Body ===
Ercole Spada at Zagato transformed the DB4 GT into a smaller, more aerodynamic, super-lightweight car. Many steel components were replaced with the more lightweight and heat-resistant aluminium components. All non-essential elements disappeared, such as the bumpers. With the help of Perspex and aluminium components, more than was shed from the DB4 GT.

== Racing history ==
Four of the original Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato&#x27;s chassis, No.s 0191, 0193, 0182 (1 VEV) and 0183 (2 VEV), were built to a lightened DP207/209 specification especially for racing. The DP209 cars have a lower roofline, larger rear wings, a reshaped tail and a flatter, longer front end.

The first major race using an Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato was around Easter in 1961 at Goodwood. Driven by Stirling Moss, the car finished 3rd, behind an Aston Martin DB4 GT and the winning Ferrari 250 GT.

The most prominent DB4 GT Zagatos, affectionately known by the registration plates they share, &quot;1 VEV&quot; and &quot;2 VEV&quot;, were both raced under John Ogier&#x27;s Essex Racing Stable, with assistance from the Aston Martin factory. Both the Zagatos raced in the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans. However a repeat of the 1959 Le Mans victory was not to be, with both cars retiring. In July 1961 at a British Grand Prix Support race, the Zagato had its first victory with &quot;2 VEV&quot; taking the last lap lead from a Jaguar E Type.

&quot;2 VEV&quot; crashed into a spa in 1962 and was rebuilt to the lightweight DP209 specification. After a car accident in 1993, the car was returned to the 1962 specification.

Chassis 0200 raced in the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans; however, a blown piston after hours forced the car to retire.

== Sanction II Zagatos ==

In 1988, four unutilised chassis numbers were put to use. With the approval of Aston Martin, four DB4 chassis were appropriately uprated to GT specifications. These chassis were then sent to Zagato&#x27;s Milan workshop to be bodied like the originals, with a smaller oval grille, without the stock DB4 GT&#x27;s rear tail fins, and with a smoothed out rear end. To familiarise the workforce with construction techniques of the 1960s, an original DB4 GT Zagato was sent there to be dismantled. These &quot;Works-Approved Replicas&quot; were known as the &quot;Sanction II&quot; cars. They were outwardly identical, but several changes were effected in the interest of better handling. Each of these cars sold for over $1,000,000. Differences from the &quot;originals&quot; include a larger engine capacity, increased from 3.7 to 4.2 litres, and a smaller wheel diameter, reduced from 16 inches to 15. The first of the four GT-specification rolling chassis was delivered to Zagato in January 1989 and the fourth in April of the same year, with all four being completed in July 1991. All four cars were then given their own chassis numbers, fitting for the 1960s.

=== Comparison of Sanction I to Sanction II ===
Rolls-Royce Phantom in 1961 cost £7,000, in 1988 - $300,000.

== Sanction III Zagatos ==

 The Zagato factory still had two spare body shells left over after producing the Sanction II Zagatos. In 1992, Richard Williams approached the executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd, Walter Hayes, and sought approval for the spare body shells to be used to create two further &quot;Sanction&quot; cars. Walter Hayes gave his approval and the body shells along with two neglected Aston Martin DB4s (chassis No.s DB4/344/R and DB4/424/R) were completed to form a pair of Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato &quot;Sanction IIIs&quot; in the year 2000.

== Aston Martin Continuation Series ==
In April 2019, Aston Martin Works (the heritage division of Aston Martin) started building a run of 19 DB4 GT Zagatos. The cars can only be purchased as part of the &quot;DBZ Centenary Collection&quot; pack which also includes an Aston Martin DBS GT Zagato. Instead of the original 3.7-litre straight-six, the recreations from Aston Martin Works use a 4.7-litre engine now making around 400 bhp. Aston Martin Works manufactured Continuation Series which captures the essence of Aston Martin&#x27;s illustrious heritage.

== Replicas ==

Various replica cars have been constructed based on DB4 and DB4 GT chassis. These replica (or recreation) cars bear a resemblance to the original Zagatos, but were not made by Zagato.

<doc id="1046870" wikidata="Q9094265" url="?curid=1046870" title="New World wine">
<text>New World wines are those wines produced outside the traditional winegrowing areas of Europe and the Middle East, in particular from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Japan (primarily Tokachi), Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States (primarily California). The phrase connotes a distinction between these &quot;New World&quot; wines and those wines produced in &quot;Old World&quot; countries with a long-established history of wine production, essentially in Europe and the Middle East, most notably: France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Romania, Georgia, and Switzerland.

Both the quantity and quality of New World wine production have increased greatly since about 1970.

Outside their home markets, New World wines can be said to have been very successful in exports to non-wine producing countries, above all the United Kingdom, and also to North America. But they have achieved relatively little penetration in old wine-making countries such as France and Italy.

==History==

===Early wines in the Americas===
Alcoholic beverages were made by Pre-Columbian indigenous peoples of the Americas. Indigenous peoples are known to have used maize, potatoes, quinoa, pepper tree fruits and strawberries to make alcoholic beverages. Despite the existence of species of the genus &quot;Vitis&quot; (to which &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; belongs) in Venezuela, Colombia, Central America and Mexico, indigenous peoples did not ferment these species and therefore did not make wine.

Spanish settlers in the Americas initially brought Old World animals and plants to the Americas for self-consumption in their attempt to reproduce the diet they had in Spain and Europe. A further stimulus for the production of New World wine in Spanish America might have been that European wines exported to the Americas were in general not transported in bottles nor sealed with cork which made them prone to be sour.

Attempts to grow vines in the Americas began in Hispaniola during the second voyage of Columbus in 1494. Ferdinand II of Aragon, King of Spain, banned the planting of vines in Hispaniola in 1503. After the establishment of vines in Hispaniola in early 16th century vineyards were successfully established in Mexico in 1524. Hernán Cortés, conqueror of Mexico, promoted the establishment of vines and made it in 1524 a requirement for Spanish settlers that wanted to acquire land in the Mexican Plateau to establish vineyards in their lands. The growing of vines in Peru is known to have been ventured by Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes in the 1540s. The latter established vineyards in Ica from where vines then were taken into Chile and Argentina.

The most common of the early grapes was a black grape called &quot;Mission&quot; (Spanish: Misión) which was planted in Mexico and subsequently also in Texas, and later in California. Grapes of the same stock were planted in Peru where it received the name &quot;Negra peruana&quot; (Peruvian black) and from this came the most common Chilean grape: the &quot;País&quot;. This Chilean grape was introduced into what is now Argentina where it came to be known as &quot;Criolla chica&quot;. These grapes are supposed to have originated from Spain but there is also a possibility that they originated from Italy as they resemble very much the variety &quot;Mónica&quot; grown in Sardinia as well as Spain.

In the second half of the 16th century, the demand for wine among Spanish settlers caused a surge in Spanish wine exports to Mexico and Cuba. However, this was not the case for Peru, Chile, and Argentina, where cultivation of vineyards had proven to be a success and, thus, required fewer imports of Spanish wines. Relative to Peru and Chile, Spanish settlers in Mexico established very few vineyards by comparison.

In the 16th and 17th century the principal winegrowing area of the Americas was in the central and southern coast of Peru, specifically in the area of Ica and Pisco. Apart from Peru and Chile Paraguay developed despite its high temperatures into a wine-making area in the 16th century. Hernando Arias de Saavedra who visited the city of Asunción in 1602 said there was 187 vineyards totalling 1.768.000 individual plants. Other sources cite 2.000.000 and 1.778.000 plants around the same time. Paraguayan wine was exported downstream to Santa Fe and from there to the Platine market. Paraguayan wine is also known to have reached Córdoba in central Argentina.

===Changes in the Americas and opening of South Africa===
In 1595 the Spanish Crown banned the establishment of new vineyards in the Americas, but this order was largely ignored. The ban sought to protect Iberian wine from competition by Peruvian wine and can be considered an example of commodity mercantilism. Moreover, the Spanish Crown banned the export of Peruvian wine to Panama and Guatemala in 1614 and 1615 respectively. The enforcement of the restrictions on wine growth and trade in the Spanish Empire was in general lax. The only market in the Americas the Spanish Crown managedto some degreeto secure for Iberian wine was Mexico.

The growth of mining in Potosí in present-day Bolivia, which became the largest city in the Americas in the 17th century, created a constant demand for wine which was supplied mainly from Peru. In Potosí part of salaries were paid with wine. Furthermore, Peruvian wine growers supplied the city of Lima, the most important political centre in South America in the 16th and 17th centuries. In Chile wine demand was guaranteed by the Army of Arauco, a permanent army financed with silver from Potosí which fought native Mapuches. In the view that Parauguayan wine could not compete in these three markets Paraguayans abandoned winegrowing and sought instead income from tobacco and yerba mate exports. In the 18th century practically no winegrowing occurred in Paraguay.

In 1687 the whole southern coast of Peru was struck by the 1687 Peru earthquake which destroyed the cities of Villa de Pisco and Ica. The earthquake destroyed wine cellars and mud containers used for wine storage. This event marked the end of the Peruvian wine-boom. The suppression of the Society of Jesus in Spanish America in 1767 caused the Jesuit vineyards in Peru to be auctioned at high prices but new owners did not have the same expertise as the Jesuits contributing to a production decline. Peruvian wine-making was further challenged by the fact that production of pisco, also made from grapes, rose from being exceeded in the early 18th century by wine to represent 90% of the grape beverages prepared in Peru in 1764. Even after the shift to pisco making vineyards in Peru encountered economic troubles since in the late 18th century the Spanish Crown lifted the ban on the production of rum in Peru which was cheaper to make but of lower quality than pisco.

The decline of Peruvian wine even caused Peru to import some wine from Chile as it happened in 1795 when Lima imported 5.000 troves (Spanish: &quot;botijas&quot;) from Concepción in southern Chile. This particular export showed the emergence of Chile relative to Peru as a wine-making region. Eduard Friedrich Poeppig claimed, as some others did before him, that the wines from Concepción were the best of Chile, likely due to the less arid climate of southern Chile.

The New World imported wine from the early days of European colonisation, particularly for religious purposes. Perhaps the first significant example of the trade going the other way was Constantia from South Africa, which by the 18th century had become a firm favourite among European royalty.

===New World wines in the Industrial Age===
Vine cuttings from the Cape of Good Hope were brought to the penal colony of New South Wales by Governor Phillip on the First Fleet (1788). An attempt at wine making from these first vines failed, but with perseverance, other settlers managed to successfully cultivate vines for winemaking, and Australian-made wine was available for sale domestically by the 1820s. In 1822 Gregory Blaxland became the first person to export Australian wine, and was the first winemaker to win an overseas award. In 1830 vineyards were established in the Hunter Valley. In 1833 James Busby returned from France and Spain with a serious selection of grape varieties including most classic French grapes and a good selection of grapes for fortified wine production.

Early Australian winemakers faced many difficulties, particularly due to the unfamiliar Australian climate. However they eventually achieved considerable success. &quot;At the 1873 Vienna Exhibition the French judges, tasting blind, praised some wines from Victoria, but withdrew in protest when the provenance of the wine was revealed, on the grounds that wines of that quality must clearly be French.&quot; Australian wines continued to win high honours in French competitions. A Victorian Syrah (also called Shiraz) competing in the 1878 Paris Exhibition was likened to Château Margaux and &quot;its taste completed its trinity of perfection.&quot; One Australian wine won a gold medal &quot;first class&quot; at the 1882 Bordeaux International Exhibition and another won a gold medal &quot;against the world&quot; at the 1889 Paris International Exhibition.

Chilean wine begun to modernize in 1851 when Silvestre Ochagavia imported cuttings of French varieties. Silvestre Ochagavia is credited with introducing the varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir, Cot, Merlot, Semillon and Riesling into Chile. Other wealthy wine growers followed suite. By the 1870s the wine industry was the most developed area of Chilean agriculture.
The region of Mendoza, or historically Cuyo, experienced an unprecedented wine-boom in the 19th century and early 20th century which turned it into the fifth winegrowing area of the world and the first in Latin America. The establishment of the Buenos Aires-Mendoza railroad in 1885 ended the lengthy and costly trade with carts that connected these two regions of Argentina and sparked development of vineyards in Mendoza. Furthermore, massive immigration to Río de La Plata mainly from Southern Europe increased demand and bought know-how to the old-fashioned Argentine wine industry. The vineyards of Mendoza totalled 1.000 ha in 1830 but grew to 45.000 in 1910, surpassing Chile which had during the 19th century had a larger areas planted with vines and a more modern industry. By 1910 around 80% of the area of Argentine vineyards were planted with French stock, mainly &quot;Malbec&quot;.

During the 19th century Peruvian wine-making went further into decline. Demand in industrialized Europe caused many Peruvian winegrowers to shift the land use from vineyards to lucrative cotton fields, contributing further to the decline of the wine and pisco industry. This was particularly true during the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865) when the cotton prices skyrocketed due to the Blockade of the South and its cotton fields. Also in South Africa did wine making suffer a stunning blow in the 1860s with the implementation of the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty in 1860 that forced South African wines to compete with French wines in Britain and resulted a doubling of French wine imports to Britain. South African vineyards also suffered a second setback after the arrival of the Phylloxera plague in the 1880s.

===20th century===
Chilean wine exports to Argentina were hampered by the lack of effective land transport and a series of war scares. This situation changed after the Pactos de Mayo were signed in 1902 and the inauguration of the Transandine Railway in 1909, making war unlikely and trade across the Andes easy. Governments agreed to sign a free trade agreement. Argentine winegrowers association, &quot;Centro Vitivinícola Nacional&quot;, dominated by European immigrants protested vigorously against the free trade agreement since Chilean wines were considered a threat to the local industry. The complaints of Argentine wine growers in conjunction with that of cattle farmers in Chile ended up tearing down the plans for a free trade agreement.

==Characteristics of New World wines==
===Style===
Since New World vineyards are generally in hotter climates than those of Central-Northern Europein fact some major New World regions are irrigated desertNew World grapes tend to be riper. Thus New World wines tend to be correspondingly more alcoholic and full-bodied. Critics such as Robert M. Parker, Jr. have influenced New World producers and consumers towards a fruitier style, with more use of new oak. However, in recent years there has been a reaction against some of the very oaky, alcoholic styles that typified late 1980s Australian Chardonnays for example, as cooler vineyards have been identified and winemakers have become more sophisticated and more restrained.

===Varietal labelling===
Traditionally New World wine used names of well-known European regions, such as Burgundy, Champagne, Sherry, Port, and Hock. This gave consumers a general idea of how the wine might taste. This changed as winemakers developed the confidence to develop their own styles of wine such as Grange. Europeans producers objected to the use of their regional names, and writers such as Frank Schoonmaker in the US encouraged the use of varietal names as used on Alsace wine. One reason was that unlike Europe, there was no history of particular localities being associated with particular styles of wine, and winemakers might buy in grapes from many sources. Indeed, wines such as Grange specifically ignored the origin of the grapes in order to achieve a more consistent style. So led by winemakers such as Robert Mondavi, varietal labelling became common during the 1960s and 1970s, and has since spread to most of Eastern Europe and much of Western Europe.

Subsequently, New World winemakers have &#x27;rediscovered&#x27; the art of blending wines, with blends such as Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon, Semillon/Sauvignon blanc and the Rhone combination of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvedre (&quot;GSM&quot;) all becoming more common. And as New World viticulturists have better understood the soils and climates of their vineyards, terroir has come to the New World, with the &#x27;terra rossa&#x27; of Coonawarra known for its Cabernet Sauvignons, and the Eden Valley and Clare Valley and Chile&#x27;s Bío-Bío Valley for Riesling.

===Marketing===
Being less dependent on geography, New World wines have placed more emphasis on branding as a marketing tool, following the example set by Germany&#x27;s Blue Nun and Portugal&#x27;s Mateus Rosé, brands created in 1927 and in 1942 respectively. One particular style of branding has been the &#x27;critter wines&#x27; that use animals on their labels. Without the partible inheritance of the Napoleonic code to worry about, New World vineyards tend to be very much bigger than those in Burgundy for example, which has allowed economies of scale and a better ability to negotiate with mass market retailers. With supermarkets selling an increasing proportion of wine in many markets, New World producers are better positioned to take advantage of this trend towards high volumes and low margins.

===Ownership===
The greater size of New World wine companies has made them attractive targets for multinational drinks companies seeking to exploit the trend towards drinking wine rather than beer or spirits. Thus, the Foster&#x27;s Group bought up both Beringer Blass (a holding company for Wolf Blass, Mildara Wines and many others) and Southcorp Wines (holding company for Penfolds, Lindeman&#x27;s, Wynns and many others). Pernod-Ricard have bought Montana Wines, Diageo own Blossom Hill, and Constellation Brands have a portfolio that spans the New World, from Ravenswood and Vincor to Nobilo and Hardys.

==Wine-making countries==
===Argentina===


Argentina is the world&#x27;s fifth biggest wine producer though it has traditionally had a high domestic consumption (in 2006, Argentines averaged over 40 litres per capita in one year). It has a long tradition of winemaking under the Spanish, going back to 1557, but the industry has been influenced by more recent immigrants, notably Italians and also Germans. Exports increased during the mid-1990s following the success of their neighbours in Chile, and accelerated after the economic crisis of 2002.

The long history of viticulture in Argentina has brought forth the evolution of many local varieties, but perhaps the most typically Argentine grape is the Torrontés, which makes an aromatic white wine. However, Argentines love red wine to go with their famous steaks. Malbec has proven to be the most successful variety in export markets, with Barbera and &quot;Bonarda&quot; (now known to be Corbeau, a minor variety from Savoie) being blended into more affordable wines.

The Mendoza Province, which is Argentina&#x27;s main producer, has also gained recognition from the wine tourism business due to important investments in new wineries and hotel accommodations. Other producing areas include San Juan, Salta, La Rioja, Catamarca, Rio Negro and the Buenos Aires wine region.

===Australia===

Vine cuttings from South Africa were brought on the First Fleet (1788), and though the settlers took time to adapt to the new conditions, wine exports began in 1822. As mentioned above, by the 1880s Australian wines were winning prizes in Europe. Phylloxera struck in eastern winegrowing regions from the 1870s, leading to the destruction of many vineyards. With South Australia free from Phylloxera it contains some of the oldest continuously harvested vineyards on earth.

Penfolds Grange and others led the revival of interest in table wines, which culminated in 2000, when Australia sold more wine to the United Kingdom than did France.

While some Australian wines, their Chardonnays in particular, have previously been criticized for being over-oaked and over-ripe, Australian winemaking is now some of the most sophisticated in the world, with vineyards increasingly planted in cooler climates, such as Pinot noir in Tasmania, and unoaked wines becoming popular. Several regional specialities have emerged, notably Shiraz in the Barossa Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon in Coonawarra, Riesling in the Eden Valley and Clare Valley, and Hunter Valley Sémillon. Rutherglen Muscats are perhaps the finest fortified wines of the New World.

===Brazil===

Brazil is the third-largest producer of wine in Latin America, behind Argentina and Chile. Better-quality wines () are produced from the European grapevine. In 2003, only some were planted with such vines.

===Canada===

Canada followed a similar path to the eastern United Statesearly attempts to grow &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; failed, leading to a significant export industry based on &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; and &quot;Vitis riparia&quot;, fortified to disguise the &#x27;foxy&#x27; aromas. The country had its own version of Prohibition until 1927, and after it ended red tape inhibited the industry until 1974. In the following years improved viticulture and grape varieties allowed a substantial expansion of the industry in the 1990s, centered around the parts of Southern Ontario warmed by the Great Lakes, and in the Okanagan Valley of southern British Columbia. While there has been some progress with red wines from the Bordeaux varieties and Pinot noir, Canada&#x27;s most successful wines are ice wines made from grapes such as Riesling, Vidal, and even Cabernet Franc.

===Chile===

As in Argentina, Chilean viticulture dates back to the Conquistadores. The Bordeaux varieties arrived in the mid-19th century, although for a long time many of the vines thought to be Merlot were in fact Carménère, and the latter has become something of a signature grape. It is the seventh biggest producer of wine in the world; traditionally quantity was favored over quality, and red tape discouraged improvement. Under the Pinochet reforms of the 1980s, investments were made in wineries and vineyards, and exports began in earnest in the mid-1990s. Traditionally Chilean vineyards were in semi-arid areas irrigated by water from the Andes, but there has been increasing interest in cooler areas such as the Leyda Valley (becoming known for its Pinot noir) and the Bío-Bío Valley, which suits Riesling and Gewürztraminer.

Chile is notable for being one of the few vine-growing regions to be free of phylloxera.
===Colombia===
The wine history of Colombia was different from other countries in the region. Wine was mainly produced for religions reasons by Catholic priests in monasteries across the country. Due to the restrictions in allowing European immigrants to enter the country after the independence from Spain, the wine industry didn&#x27;t develop like in other South American countries. Beer and aguardiente became more popular drinks than wine. There are a few areas in Colombia that produce fine wine of excellent quality, but the majority of the wine is consumed locally. Villa de Leyva is a small region, north of Bogota, which is known for its Mediterranean climate and the wine produced in these areas is of very high international standards. El Valle del Cauca, south of Bogotá, is also a well known winery area. Wines in Colombia tend to be sweeter due to the climate of the Andes, hot weather and constant rain.

===Japan===
Although viticulture and the cultivation of grapes for table consumption has a long history in Japan, domestic wine production using locally-produced grapes only really began with the adoption of Western culture during the Meiji restoration in the second half of the 19th century. The Agency states the share of Japanese wine, as defined as domestically-produced wine from domestically-grown grapes, as only 4% of total domestic consumption, or 14,988 kiloliters. Only 58 kiloliters of Japanese wine was exported overseas.

===Mexico===


Mexico is the oldest wine-making region in the Americas.

In 1549, Spanish explorers and settlers came across a fertile valley in the present-day state of Coahuila where they encountered native vines and founded the Mission of Santa María de las Parras or &quot;Holy Mary of the Vines&quot;. In 1597, the Hacienda de San Lorenzo was established by the Spanish settler Don Lorenzo García, where he founded, along with other Spanish missionaries, Casa Maderothe oldest winery house in the Americas.

Many of the vines from Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila and other places in Mexico were the first to be exported and cultivated in what is now California, as well as other provinces in Northern New Spain and other Spanish colonies in South America. In 1699, the King of Spainalarmed by competition from the New Worldprohibited wine production in New Spain, with the exception of wines for the church. The prohibition lasted until the Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain in 1810.

As of the 2013, about 90% of Mexican wine is produced in the northwestern state of Baja California, neighboring the wine-producing region of California in the U.S., particularly in the Valley of Guadalupe, Ensenada Municipality.

===New Zealand===

The New Zealand viticulture industry was started in a small way by Croatian immigrants at the end of the 19th century, but it was not until the 1970s that it began to flourish. Several factors came together at that time - Britain&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community in 1973 ended favourable terms of agricultural trade, while New Zealanders themselves developed a taste for wine as local alcohol licensing laws changed and cheap air travel exposed them to different cultures.

Various grapes were tried in the early years, but it was in the 1980s that New Zealand developed the distinctive style of Sauvignon blanc that became its trademark. Since then the Burgundy grapes of Chardonnay and Pinot noir have been developed in cooler, more southerly vineyards, with considerable success. More recently there has been increasing popularity for the &#x27;aromatic&#x27; white varieties such as Gewürztraminer and Riesling, with Auslese styles also being attempted.

=== Peru ===
The first grapevines were brought to Peru shortly after its conquest by Spain. Spanish chroniclers from the time note that the first vinification in South America took place in the &quot;hacienda&quot; Marcahuasi of Cuzco. However, the largest and most prominent vineyards of the 16th and 17th century Americas were established in the Ica valley of south-central Peru. In the 1540s, Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes began vineyards in Peru. The latter established vineyards in Ica, which Spaniards from Andalucia and Extremadura used to introduce grapevines into Chile.

In 1687 the whole southern coast of Peru was struck by the 1687 Peru earthquake which destroyed the cities of Villa de Pisco and Ica. The earthquake destroyed wine cellars and mud containers used for wine storage. This event marked the end of the Peruvian wine-boom.

In 2008, there were some of grape plantations in Peru, including table grapes, and some of wine was produced, with an increasing trend in both plantations and wine production. Most vineyards are located on the central coast, around Pisco and Ica, where most of Peru&#x27;s winemaking and distillation takes place.

===South Africa===

Wine was first produced in South Africa by the founder of Cape Town in 1659, and by the late 18th century Constantia, made from Muscat de Frontignan (Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains), was popular among European royalty. However the vineyards were decimated by phylloxera and the KWV cooperative that ran most of the industry since 1918 gave little encouragement to produce quality wine. The end of apartheid sparked a wave of investment and innovation in the vineyards of the Cape, although there remains large areas of undistinguished grape varieties such as Colombard. Stellenbosch and Paarl can produce world-class wines from the Bordeaux varieties, Shiraz and also from Pinotage, a variety bred locally from Pinot noir and Cinsaut. South Africa is also the second home of Chenin blanc, known until the mid-20th century as Steen; Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains is known locally as red and white Muscadel, and is once again being used to make Constantia.

===United States===

Although wine is made throughout the United States, 90% of it comes from California. The Gallo Winery runs an industrial facility in Modesto, California that produces the majority of the state&#x27;s wine exports. Most of the rest is split between Washington state and New York state, followed by Oregon. California&#x27;s earliest grape vines were imported from &quot;New Spain&quot;, or Mexico, which in turn were brought by Spanish explorers and settlers. North America has several native species of &quot;Vitis&quot;, from which wine has been made for a long time in the east of the country, although the &#x27;foxy&#x27; aromas of wines produced from these species are not to everyone&#x27;s taste. The Catawba variety led the way for winemaking from native species, first in Ohio and later in the Finger Lakes area of New York. California followed a path similar to Latin American countries, with Spanish missionaries starting the first vineyard of &quot;vinifera&quot; vines in 1769, and later immigrants from Bordeaux and Italy bringing their native grapes with them. Soon a thriving industry developed, particularly in the Napa Valley, which was stopped in its tracks by phylloxera and, uniquely, Prohibition (1920–1933).

One interesting consequence of Prohibition was that vineyards were replanted with lower quality grapes such as Alicante Bouschet that could survive transportation to home winemakers, and this tradition of home winemaking changed taste preferences from a dry style before Prohibition to a much sweeter style. In general Prohibition had a devastating effect on commercial winemaking in the country, which only started to recover in the late 1960s and 1970s under major industry pioneers such as Ernest and Julio Gallo, Robert Mondavi and the world-class viticultural scientists at the University of California, Davis. The latter institution has played a leading role in the recovery of wine in the United States, in particular identifying just what vines were actually planted (notably California&#x27;s signature grape, the robust red Zinfandel, which was found to be Croatia&#x27;s Crljenak Kaštelanski), and encouraging the use of better clones of the traditional European varieties. In the 1970s, geographical appellations were designated as American Viticultural Areas.

In the years after Prohibition, the domestic market demanded cheap &#x27;jug wines&#x27; and sweet fortified wines. These tastes led to local styles such as White Zinfandel (a sweet rosé) and &quot;bum wines&quot;. Interest in traditional European varieties increased after Mondavi reinvented Sauvignon blanc in a dry, heavily oaked style called Fumé Blanc, leading to the innovations that triumphed so spectacularly in Paris in 1976. While California is known for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Chardonnay in particular, it produces such a massive amount of wine that just about every grape variety ends up being grown there to a greater or lesser extent. For instance, the &quot;Rhone Rangers&quot; have raised awareness of the Rhone varieties, notably Viognier, and there has been speculation that climate change will force California to look further south in Europe for grape varieties. The Northwest states of Oregon and Washington are known for their Pinot noirs and Rieslings while New York continues to produce wine mostly from &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; varieties and hybrids.

<text>Habitat is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by LucasArts. It is the first attempt at a large-scale commercial virtual community that was graphic based. Initially created in 1985 by Randy Farmer, Chip Morningstar, Aric Wilmunder and Janet Hunter, the game was made available as a beta test in 1986 by Quantum Link, an online service for the Commodore 64 computer and the corporate progenitor to AOL. Both Farmer and Morningstar were given a First Penguin Award at the 2001 Game Developers Choice Awards for their innovative work on Habitat. As a graphical MUD it is considered a forerunner of modern MMORPGs unlike other online communities of the time (i.e. MUDs and massively multiplayer onlines with text-based interfaces). &quot;Habitat&quot; had a GUI and large user base of consumer-oriented users, and those elements in particular have made &quot;Habitat&quot; a much-cited project and acknowledged benchmark for the design of today&#x27;s online communities that incorporate accelerated 3D computer graphics and immersive elements into their environments.

==Culture==
Users in the virtual world were represented by onscreen avatars, meaning that individual users had a third-person perspective of themselves, making it rather like a videogame. Players in the same region (denoted by all objects and elements shown on a particular screen) could see, speak (through onscreen text output from the users), and interact with one another. &quot;Habitat&quot; was governed by its citizenry. The only off-limits portions were those concerning the underlying software constructs and physical components of the system. The users were responsible for laws and acceptable behavior within &quot;Habitat&quot;. The authors of &quot;Habitat&quot; were greatly concerned with allowing the broadest range of interaction possible, since they felt that interaction, not technology or information, truly drove cyberspace. Avatars had to barter for resources within &quot;Habitat&quot;, and could even be robbed or &quot;killed&quot; by other avatars. Initially, this led to chaos within &quot;Habitat&quot;, which led to rules and regulations (and authority avatars) to maintain order.

==Timeline==
Randy Farmer, Chip Morningstar, Aric Wilmunder and Janet Hunter created the first graphical virtual world, which was released in a beta test by Lucasfilm Games in 1986 as &quot;Habitat&quot; for the Quantum Link service for the Commodore 64. &quot;Habitat&quot; ran from 1986 to 1988, and was closed down at the end of the pilot run. The service proved too costly to be viable, so Lucasfilm Games recouped the cost of development by releasing a sized down version called &quot;Club Caribe&quot; on Quantum Link in 1988. It was then licensed by Fujitsu in 1988, and released in Japan as &quot;Fujitsu Habitat&quot; in 1990.

In 1994, Fujitsu Cultural Technologies was spun off as a new division of Fujitsu Open Systems Solutions, INC or OSSI for short. In conjunction with Electric Communities, the two companies began work on the &quot;WorldsAway&quot; project (which was codenamed &quot;Reno&quot; at the time). Originally, the initial plan was for the team to work from the Fujitsu Habitat code and bring it to the Mac and Windows operating systems. This proved not to be possible due to the fact the underlying architecture was nothing like its predecessor &quot;Habitat&quot; due to being developed by a different team. This led to delays in the project whilst the kinks were being worked out. It was launched on CompuServe in 1995 as a free service for members. The world was called Dreamscape and moved to the public Internet in 1997 still under the operation of Fujitsu. As CompuServe morphed into AOL&#x27;s &quot;value brand&quot;, Fujitsu sought to sell off its product as they were making a loss. Inworlds.com (who later became Avaterra, Inc) stepped up and bought the licensing rights and took over the reins. In 2011 the Dreamscape was still surviving independently as one of the VZones.com worlds – owned by Stratagem Corporation. Other WorldsAway worlds using the same server software that have been launched during Stratagem times were newHorizone, Seducity, Second Kingdom and Datylus. The VZones.com worlds closed in August 2014. The only remaining licensees of the technology is vzones.com.

===Creation===
One challenge in producing games is to resist the &quot;conceit that all things may be planned in advance and then directly implemented according to the plan&#x27;s detailed specification&quot;. Morningstar and Farmer argue that this mentality only leads to failure as the potential capabilities and imagination of a game would remain confined within the small niche of developers. They generalized this well by pointing out that &quot;even very imaginative people are limited in the range of variation that they can produce, especially if they are working in a virgin environment uninfluenced by the works and reactions of other designers&quot;.

An example of this approach was when Wilmunder, the programmer responsible for developing both backgrounds for the Habitat World and Avatar animations noted how the original specification only included a single generic male and female character. Wilmunder determined that the system could go further and he implemented the ability to customize player Avatars, first by patterning their clothing, and later allowing Avatars to change height, carry items, and ultimately to allow the players to select from over one hundred different heads for their characters, capabilities that are today taken for granted in other Avatar based systems. This feature became so popular that &#x27;heads&#x27; were sold in in-game vending machines and were even used as rewards for players when they completed quests.

With this outlook, Morningstar and Farmer stated that a developer should consider providing a variety of possible experiences within the cyberspace, ranging from events with established rules and goals (i.e. hunts) to activities propelled by the user&#x27;s own motivations (entrepreneur) to completely free-form, purely existential activities (socializing with other members). The best method to manage and maintain such an immense project, they have discovered, was to simply to let the people drive the direction of design and aid them in achieving their desires. In short the owners became the facilitators as much as designers and implementers.

Regardless, the authors note the importance of separation between the access levels of the designer and the operator. They classify the two coexisting virtualities as the &quot;infrastructure level&quot; (implementation of the cyberspace, or the &quot;reality&quot; of the world), which the creators should only control, and the &quot;experiential level&quot; (visual and interactive feature for users), which the operators are free to explore. The user not need to be aware of how data are encoded in the application. This naturally follows from the good programming practice of encapsulation.

===Revival===
In 2016, a project was undertaken to relaunch &quot;Habitat&quot; using emulation of both the Commodore 64 and the original Q-Link system that &quot;Habitat&quot; ran on. The project was headed by Alex Handy, founder of The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment (MADE), who received the game&#x27;s source code from its original developers. That July, the source code was uploaded by MADE to GitHub under MIT license for open review.

In February 2017, an open-source project to revive &quot;Habitat&quot; led by Randy Farmer (one of &quot;Habitat&quot;″s creators) named &quot;NeoHabitat&quot; was announced to the public. The project was requesting volunteer contributors to aid in developing code, region design, documentation and provide other assistance. Due to the volunteer contributors, original source files, maps created during development and database backups were unearthed. This enabled the original Populopolis world to be fully restored. &quot;NeoHabitat&quot; is currently operational and accessible to all. Development is mostly complete and the original &quot;Habitat&quot; experience can be had once more.

==&quot;WorldsAway&quot;==
&quot;WorldsAway&quot; was launched in 1995 and was developed by some of the &quot;Habitat&quot; team, although no code is shared between the two projects. &quot;WorldsAway&quot; is an online graphical &quot;virtual chat&quot; environment in which users designed their own two dimensionally represented avatars. It was one of the first visual virtual worlds. In 1996 it was one of the top 20 most popular forums on Compuserve. &quot;WorldsAway&quot; users would login, originally through dial-up Compuserve accounts and later through the Internet. First-time users would choose their gender, name, head and body style on a virtual ship before entering the world proper to meet other online users (these could be changed later by paying a quantity of tokens).

Each subscriber would view and manipulate their own avatar which was displayed in a limited set of poses and profiles. A user would walk their avatar around a virtual city (named Kymer), enter shops and teleporter cabins, gesture or chat to other avatars (cartoon like text bubbles would appear), and carry out various in-game actions. Ty Burr&#x27;s 1996 review of the three graphical chat worlds then available (the others were &quot;Worlds Chat&quot; and Time Warner&#x27;s &quot;The Palace&quot;) rated &quot;WorldsAway&quot; the lowest at C+, criticizing the slowness and lack of flexibility.

Unlike some modern virtual worlds, &quot;WorldsAway&quot; did not boast 3D graphics or any combat system (although inworld combat had been planned, it was never implemented). Most time spent in the world by users was spent on economic endeavors and chat. This meant that the world had a monetary token system and virtual business endeavors could be set up such as Clover&#x27;s famous auctions with commissions for sales, or Dennis S&#x27;s nightclub with admission charges, or the payments for the various street games such as bingo. The token system facilitated the economy. Avatars received tokens based on the number of hours played, from sales of objects, from gifts, and other sources such as running enterprises. Rare and/or functional objects were introduced into the world by stores and Acolytes. Acolytes were appointed by the Oracles and had access to changing supplies of objects that they gave away or awarded as prizes to the community. Clover&#x27;s famous auctions were held weekly and people bid vast amounts of tokens to acquire rare items such as heads, clothing, furniture, and other useful or artistic objects. Apartments could be purchased, furnished, or sold. Other popular past-times were playing Bingo and other simple games. These games were not a part of the original software, but were made by third party developers as plug-ins.

===&quot;Dreamscape&quot;===
&quot;Dreamscape&quot; was the first graphical online chat environment built on the &quot;WorldsAway&quot; platform. It allowed users to create an avatar to represent themselves in a 2D world and interact with other users and virtual items. The player chooses an avatar, which is the graphical representation of the player. The avatar can text chat, move, gesture, use facial expressions, and is customizable in a virtually unlimited number of ways. Avatars earn money, own possessions, rent apartments, and make friends. The environment itself is composed of thousands of screens, in which the player&#x27;s avatar moves about.

== Popular culture ==
Much of the second and third seasons of the American TV series &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot; is centered around the development and troubles of the fictional tech startup &quot;Mutiny&quot;, heavily inspired by the story of PlayNET and Quantum Link in the 1980s. In the show, Mutiny transitions from an online games company to eventually delivering an online subscriber-based graphical chat community for Commodore 64 users, mirroring &quot;Habitat&quot;.

==Reception==
Roy Wagner reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and wrote that &quot;this game effectively optimizes the local storage, processing and graphics power of the low cost Commodore 64/128 home computer that is in over four million homes and the real-time, person-to-person, interactivity made possible by a low cost nationwide network that is accessible with a local phone call&quot;.

<doc id="1046877" wikidata="Q1430683" url="?curid=1046877" title="Aircraft maintenance technician">
<text>An aircraft mechanic, aviation mechanic or aircraft maintenance technician (AMT) is a tradesperson who carries out aircraft maintenance and repairs. AMTs inspect and perform or supervise maintenance, repairs and alteration of aircraft and aircraft systems.

For a person who holds a mechanic certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, the rules for certification, and for certificate-holders, are detailed in Subpart D of Part 65 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), which are part of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The US licensed qualification is sometimes referred to by the FAA as the Aviation Maintenance Technician and is commonly referred to as the Airframe and Powerplant (A&amp;P).

==Certification==
In the U.S, the general requirement for eligibility for a mechanic certificate include the following. The candidate must:

*Be 18 or older
*Be able to read, speak, and understand English fluently;
*Meet the experience or educational requirement; and
*Pass a set of required tests within a maximum of 24 months.

The required tests include a set of knowledge tests, followed by a practical test, which includes an oral examination component, and which is administered by a Designated Mechanic Examiner (DME).

A person who fulfills the necessary requirements is issued a mechanic certificate with either an airframe or powerplant rating, or both. These ratings together account for the common practice of referring to mechanics as &quot;A&amp;Ps.&quot; Until 1952, instead of the Powerplant rating, an Engine rating was issued, so the abbreviation &quot;A&amp;E&quot; may appear in older documents.

Eligibility for the mechanic tests depends on the applicant&#x27;s ability to document their knowledge of required subject matter and ability to perform maintenance tasks. The FAA recognizes two ways of demonstrating the needed knowledge and skills: practical experience or completion of a training program at a school certificated under Part 147 of the FARs.

==Industry competitions==
The AMT Society presents the annual maintenance skills competition, which recognizes top AMT teams across all aviation including commercial and military.

==Applications based on experience==
Applicants for a mechanic certificate with a single rating—either airframe or powerplant—and who base their application on practical experience must demonstrate 18 months of work experience applicable to the chosen rating. Those applying for both ratings must show a total of 30 months of applicable experience. The United States military provides an opportunity to gain practical experience, and there is a simple process of obtaining eligibility from military experience to earn an Airframe and Powerplant License as long as the members careers meet the required career specialty codes or MOS.

===Applications based on education===
Applicants who attend an aviation maintenance school program certificated under Part 147 study an FAA-approved and supervised curriculum. Those applying for a mechanic certificate with a single rating—either airframe or powerplant—study a &quot;general&quot; set of subjects for at least 400 hours, as well as at least 750 hours of material appropriate to the chosen rating, for a total of 1,150 hours. Those who pursue both ratings study the &quot;general&quot; material, as well as the 750 hours for each rating, for a total of at least 1,900 hours. Completion of such a program of study typically requires between 18 and 24 months.

Required areas of study in the &quot;general&quot; curriculum include electricity, technical drawings, weight and balance, hydraulics and pneumatics, ground operation of aircraft, cleaning and corrosion control, basic mathematical calculations, forms and record-keeping, basic physics, maintenance manuals and publications, and applicable federal regulations. Thorough knowledge of FAA rules and regulations (especially with regard to accepted repair/modification procedures) is also expected of A&amp;P mechanics.

Required areas of study in the airframe curriculum include inspection, structures—wood, sheet metal, composite—and fasteners, covering, finishes, welding, assembly and rigging, hydraulics, pneumatics, cabin atmosphere control systems, instrument systems, communication and navigation systems, fuel systems, electrical systems, position and warning systems, ice and rain control systems, and fire protection systems.

Required areas of study in the powerplant curriculum include inspection, reciprocating and turbine engine theory and repair, instrument systems, fire protection systems, electrical systems, lubrication systems, ignition and starting systems, fuel metering systems, fuel systems, induction and airflow systems, cooling systems, exhaust and reverser systems, propellers, unducted fans, and auxiliary power units.

== Inspection authorization ==
Some AMTs, after at least three years of working in their field, choose to acquire an inspection authorization (IA), which is an additional rating added on to the individual&#x27;s mechanic certificate. These individuals are allowed to perform annual inspections on aircraft and sign off for return to service on major repairs and alterations on the required block of the FAA form 337. Certification and limitations, including renewal requirements, of mechanics with inspection authorization is contained in 14 CFR Part 65.

The requirements for obtaining an inspection authorization is that the AMT must be licensed for a minimum of three years and actively exercising the rights of an A&amp;P for the two years prior to the date that the IA examination is to be taken.

Renewal of the IA rating must be done every two years (on odd years) by submitting to the FAA a form showing a minimum of activity in which the IA exercised his or her authority. This activity comprises either annual inspections, major repairs, major alterations, or a minimum of 8 hours of FAA approved training. This activity must be accomplished every 12 months even though the renewal period is every 24 months.

== Employment status ==

* Training
There are 180 maintenance schools in the United States. In 2017 number of students was 18,000. The scholarship for students ranges from $2,500 to $16,000.

* Employment opportunity
In 2019 number of aircraft technicians was 292,002, only 2.4% were women. According to the 2019 report from Boeing North America will need 192,000 new technicians over the next 20 years.

* Wage level
The average annual income of aircraft maintenance personnel is $68,677 in the United States.

<doc id="1046880" wikidata="Q242761" url="?curid=1046880" title="Slovak euro coins">
<text>The Slovak euro coins are the European monetary union euro coins issued by Slovakia since 2009. They feature three separate designs for the three series of coins.

Slovakia has been a member of the European Union since May 2004, and is a member of the European Economic and Monetary Union. Slovakia adopted the euro on 1 January 2009, replacing its previous currency, the Slovak koruna.

==Adopting the euro==
In 2005, an official public contest for Slovak euro coin designs was held, which took place over two rounds. The deadline for the first round was 31 January 2005, after which the ten top designers chosen by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) were invited to make plaster reliefs of their designs. In the second round, the NBS called a public vote conducted from 12 November until 20 November 2005 on the ten designs that were picked from the over 200 submissions. On 21 November 2005, the results were made public; the most popular design was the coat of arms of Slovakia. On 20 December 2005, the design for the Slovak euro coins was officially made public on the NBS website. Since then Slovakia has been doing economic reforms to be able to adopt the euro.

After three years of reforms, on 1 April 2008, the NBS announced their plan for withdrawal, disposal and destruction of the Slovak koruna notes and coins. On 7 May 2008, the European Commission approved the application and asked member states to endorse the bid during the EU finance minister&#x27;s meeting in July 2008. Slovakia&#x27;s 12-month inflation was 2.2% compared with 3.2% that is required. Annual inflation however was 3.6% for March 2008. Fiscal deficit was 2.2% versus the reference value of 3.0%. And finally the government debt ratio was 29.4% of GDP in 2007, well below the maximum ratio of 60.0%.

On 3 June 2008, the European Union finance ministers gave Slovakia the green light to join the euro zone in 2009 while urging the country to be ready to fight inflation with tight fiscal policies. &quot;We are happy to see Slovakia join the euro zone on 1 January 2009,&quot; Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, told reporters.

Slovakia&#x27;s mint has been tasked to produce some 500 million euro and cent coins. As a preparation for the change on 1 January, starting from November 2008, these coins will be distributed to businesses all over Slovakia.

On 17 June 2008, the European Parliament agreed to Slovakia&#x27;s bid to join the euro zone from the start of 2009, urging the country to tighten fiscal policies to avoid inflationary risks. The assembly voted 589 to 17 with 86 abstentions to approve a report that said the European Union newcomer met all euro entry criteria. However, the parliament&#x27;s role is consultative only. Slovakia&#x27;s bid to become the euro zone&#x27;s 16th member was approved by EU leaders. EU finance ministers set the final conversion rate of the Slovak koruna into the euro on 8 July 2008.

On 19 June 2008, the leaders of the EU Member States confirmed Slovakia&#x27;s readiness to join the eurozone on 1 January 2009. &quot;I congratulate Slovakia for meeting all the relevant criteria&quot;, said the current President of the European Council and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša.

On 8 July 2008, the European Union formally invited Slovakia to join the European single currency and set the official rate at which korunas will be exchanged for euros – 30.1260 korunas to the euro.

On 5 September 2008, as part of the preparations for euro adoption, the NBS announced that by the end the year Slovakia planned to transport over €7 billion in banknotes from Austria and to mint coins worth €167 million to pre-stock itself with the new currency. Start-up packages containing the EUR equivalent of 500 Sk (€16.60 ) were sold at all post offices from 1 December 2008. The package contained 45 Slovak euro coins with nominal values from 1-cent (0.30 Sk) to 2 euro (60.25 Sk).

A few days before the €-day, the government spent €6.5 million to educate the public about the new currency.

<text>The Press and Journal is a daily regional newspaper serving northern and Highland Scotland including the cities of Aberdeen and Inverness. Established in 1747, it is Scotland&#x27;s oldest daily newspaper, and one of the longest-running newspapers in the world.

==History==
The newspaper was first published as a weekly title, &quot;Aberdeen&#x27;s Journal&quot;, on 29 December 1747. In 1748 it changed its name to the &quot;Aberdeen Journal&quot;. It was published on a weekly basis for 128 years until August 1876, when it became a daily newspaper.

The newspaper was owned by the Chalmers family throughout the nineteenth century, and edited by members of the family until 1849, when William Forsyth became editor. Its political position was Conservative.

In November 1922, the paper was renamed &quot;The Aberdeen Press and Journal&quot; when its parent firm joined forces with the &quot;Free Press&quot;.

Historical copies of the &quot;Aberdeen Journal&quot;, dating back to 1798, are available to search and view in digitised form at The British Newspaper Archive.

Ethel Simpson, pioneering female journalist, was the first women junior reporter at &quot;The Press and Journal&quot;, and was also one of the first female chief reporters.

==Present-day situation==
The newspaper is printed six days a week and there are six geographic editions every day (seven prior to June 2011). Although for many years a broadsheet, since 2012, &quot;The Press and Journal&quot; has been in compact size.

The newspaper is occasionally criticised for its regional perspective on global events, but the paper defends this stance, occasionally running &quot;proud to be local&quot; advertisements. Just one week after the September 11 attacks in 2001 the paper&#x27;s World news section totalled just a single half-page.

The head office of the paper was located in Mastrick, Aberdeen, and is now in the city centre. As of March 2012 employed 470 staff locally and at branch offices throughout the North of Scotland. The current editor of the newspaper is Richard Neville, who replaced former editor Damian Bates in 2017.

The paper, along with the &quot;Evening Express&quot; and &quot;Scot-Ads,&quot; is published by Aberdeen Journals, who also published the &quot;Aberdeen Citizen&quot;. It has a circulation of 22,927 copies, making it the most-read and best-selling former broadsheet newspaper in Scotland. Its circulation is greater than that of &quot;The Herald&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; combined. Aberdeen Journals is now owned by the Dundee-based D. C. Thomson media group, after being sold by the Daily Mail and General Trust in 2006.

&quot;The Press and Journal&quot;, the &quot;Evening Express&quot;, &quot;Aberdeen Citizen&quot; and &quot;Scot-Ads&quot; were all printed on Aberdeen Journals″ own printing presses in Aberdeen until May 2013. Since then, all titles are printed in Dundee. Until March 2006 the &quot;News of the World&quot; was also printed on the Aberdeen press.

==Coverage of Trump International Golf Links Development==
The &quot;Press and Journal&quot; was a staunch supporter of the building of a highly controversial golf resort by Donald Trump at the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire. The development was against the wishes of many local residents, and on an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

In 2007, the Aberdeen &quot;Evening Express&quot; ran pictures of seven councillors who voted against the application under the headline &quot;You Traitors&quot;. In 2009, the newspaper announced it would not report anything said by the protest group &quot;Tripping Up Trump&quot;, saying it was not &quot;bona fide&quot;. In contrast, opponents complained, the DC Thomson papers in Aberdeen, the &quot;Evening Express&quot; and the &quot;Press and Journal&quot; gave a large amount of positive press to Donald Trump and the real estate development.

In 2013, &quot;Press and Journal&quot; editor Damian Bates married Sarah Malone, then executive vice president and press spokeswoman for the Trump International project.

<doc id="1046910" wikidata="Q602283" url="?curid=1046910" title="The Goddess (1958 film)">
<text>The Goddess is a 1958 American drama film directed by John Cromwell and starring Kim Stanley and Lloyd Bridges. From a screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky, the film is an in-depth character study of the life of a troubled and lonely girl who becomes a movie star adored by millions, but is miserable in her private life. The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

==Plot==
Emily Ann Faulkner is born into poverty in The South, has no father, no friends, and is unloved by her indifferent mother Laureen, who does not want to be tied down by a child. As a teenager, Emily is socially ostracized by the local townspeople, except for the boys who are attracted to her good looks and sexual availability. Emily lets them have sex with her in order to have some brief respite from her loneliness; the rest of the time, she retreats into Hollywood fantasies. During WWII, she meets and marries world-weary G.I. John Tower, who also suffers from his dysfunctional upbringing as the son of a well-known movie actor. Unable to cope with a rocky marriage and unwanted pregnancy, Emily soon escapes to Hollywood, leaving her baby daughter in John&#x27;s care.

In Hollywood, Emily soon marries Dutch Seymour, a former champion boxer turned Hollywood socialite. She initially enjoys the attention and social status she gets as Dutch&#x27;s wife, but rejects his idea that they move to St. Louis so he could join his family&#x27;s business. Anxious to further her career, Emily poses for risque magazine photos and has casting couch affairs, ending her marriage to Dutch. Emily is soon transformed into the glamorous superstar sex goddess, Rita Shawn. Despite her celebrity and wealth, she is still insecure and fears being alone, seeking comfort in drinking and promiscuity.

Rita finally has a nervous breakdown requiring hospitalization, which causes her elderly mother Laureen to finally come to Hollywood for a visit. Rita is thrilled to see her mother and clings to her, trying to impress her. However, Laureen has turned from her past immorality to religious fervor, is unimpressed by Rita&#x27;s money and success, and mainly seeks to convert her daughter. Rita has very few friends, and the visiting couple she introduces to her mother as her &quot;dearest and oldest friends&quot; privately tell Laureen that they barely know Rita and only met her a short time ago, adding that Rita should see a psychiatrist.

==Production==
The story is said to be based loosely on Marilyn Monroe. According to an article published by Turner Classic Movies, 
&quot;Some critics have conjectured that &quot;The Goddess&quot; was based on the career of Ava Gardner, but most think its primary model was Marilyn Monroe, who studied at the Actors Studio at the same time Stanley did.&quot;

&quot;The Goddess&quot; was filmed, in part, in Ellicott City, Maryland, which serves as childhood home of Emily Ann and provides the backdrop for the opening and closing scenes. The interior scenes were filmed at the Gold Medal Studios, the Bronx, New York; in addition to Maryland, location filming was also done in Hollywood, at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills and at the Fox Village Theater, Westwood, California. Frank Thompson designed the costumes for the film.

==Reception==
In his June 25, 1958 review, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calls &quot;The Goddess&quot; &quot;a shattering, but truly potent, film, in which a lot of characters are groping for the fulfillment they cannot seem to find&quot;. Crowther adds that scriptwriter Chayefsky &quot;has studied his subject thoughtfully, for the meshing of human contacts and emotional relations is clear and sound. Furthermore, he has conveyed them in finely written scenes and dialogue.&quot;

The Philadelphia Inquirer was highly complimentary: “Whether ‘The Goddess’ wins prizes or not is less important than the fact it represents something extraordinary even in a day when sensitivity and integrity are to be expected in our better screen actresses….’The Goddess’ is by no means a behind-the-scenes Hollywood drama. It is very much more. Divided into three acts, or sections, called ‘Portrait of a Girl,’ ‘Portrait of a Young Woman,’ and ‘Portrait of a Goddess,” Chayevsky’s unflinching study has the inevitability of a Greek tragedy presented in the modern idiom….Just as ‘Marty’ towered over any of Chayevsky’s other television dramas subsequently turned into films, so ‘The Goddess’ surpasses ‘Marty’ in awareness and depth. Scene after scene, line after line grip the mind and heart, to move or to horrify. Nowhere has the author, his cast or director John Cromwell struck a false or artificial note.”

In the book &quot;The Immortal Marilyn (2006),&quot; scholars De John Vito and Frank Tropea praise Chayefsky&#x27;s writing as &quot;masterful&quot;, and write that Stanley &quot;pulled out all the stops, perfectly hitting every single note of Chayefsky&#x27;s complex, lyrical arias&quot;. Conversely, in an article for TCM, authors Mikita Brottman and David Sterritt criticize the work as having &quot;a stilted pace, underwritten minor characters, and a mood that&#x27;s much too solemn&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 57 percent rating based on seven contemporary and modern reviews.

==Adaptation==
In 2013, director John Mossman adapted the screenplay for a stage production at Chicago&#x27;s The Artistic Home, receiving a Jeff Award for New Adaptation and marking the first screen-to-stage adaptation of a Chayefsky screenplay.

Thereafter, he was attached to the newly formed Army&#x27;s Field Security Detachment under the command of the recently promoted Lieutenant Colonel Anuruddha Ratwatte. The Field Security Detachment was tasked with identifying internal threats to and safeguarding the prime minister, following Bandaranaike&#x27;s experience in the 1962 attempted coup d&#x27;état.

===Operation Liberation===

&quot;Operation Liberation&quot;, also known as the &quot;Vadamarachchi Operation&quot;, was launched after months of planning on 26 May 1987. Brigadier Kobbekaduwa commanded the operation on the ground as the Brigade Commander of the 3 brigade group formed comprising two infantry brigades with supporting armored, artillery and air units of the Sri Lanka Air Force numbering 8000 personal. It was the largest formation deployed by the Sri Lankan Army at that point and the first conventional battle to take place in the civil war. The objective was to take the territory of Vadamarachchi in the Jaffna peninsula from LTTE (Tamil Tiger) control. LTTE forces destroyed the bridge at Thondaimanaru to slow army progress towards Valvettithurai, the town of LTTE leader Prabhakaran&#x27;s birth. On 28 May, army troops captured Udupiddy, Valvettithurai and Nelliady. By the end of the first week of June, the army had gained control over the entire zone and captured a large cache of arms left by the LTTE.

President J.R. Jayewardene and Minister of National Security Lalith Athulathmudali had political responsibility for the operation and terminated it following Operation Poomalai, the Indian air force&#x27;s show of strength, in which it dropped supplies over Jaffna for the besieged Tamil Tigers on 4 June 1987, leading to the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.

==Principal staff officer==
In December 1987, he was appointed Principal staff officer of the Joint Operations Command and was nominated to attended the Royal College of Defence Studies. He turned down the nomination that year and accompanied President J. R. Jayewardene to Islamabad for the fourth SAARC summit in 1988. On his return he was sent to the Royal College of Defence Studies in 1989, only to be recalled during the middle of the course. However, he was quickly sent back once the British government questioned the recall mid-course.

==Higher command==
On 1 January 1990, he was promoted to major general and was appointed as general officer commanding, 1st Division based at the Panagoda Cantonment.

With the resumption of hostilities in the Eelam War II or the second phase of the civil war with following the failure of peace talks in June 1990, Kobbekaduwa was transferred to the Eastern Province as Overall Operations Commander, Eastern Sector. In July he was appointed as general officer commanding, 2nd Division and Overall Operations Commander, Northern Sector directing military operations in the northern province with his headquarters based in Anuradhapura.

He launched operation &quot;Operation Gajasinghe&quot;, withdrawing troops from Kilinochchi and strengthening the Army garrison at Elephant Pass, the critical land strip that linked the Jaffna peninsula with the mainland. New camps were set up around the main base, expanding its size. On 10 July 1991, Elephant Pass came under siege by an LTTE attack which it code-named &quot;Operation Charles Anthony&quot;, its first suicide bomber. 800 troops of the 6th battalion, Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment held out.

===Operation Balavegaya===

At this point, Major General Kobbekaduwa proposed an amphibious assault launched code named Operation Balavegaya. Launching an amphibious assault for the first time in Sri Lankan military history, plans for Operation Balavegaya were drawn up at Joint Operations headquarters in Colombo. 8,000 troops were deployed for the rescue mission to relieve the besieged camp and regain territory captured by the LTTE. This was an amphibious operation using landing craft and helicopters to transport the soldiers.

During the operation the intensity of LTTE resistance led some battalion commanders to consider aborting the operation temporarily, however, General Kobbekaduwa and Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne decided it should proceed to join the troops at the front lines. On 14 July 1991 the task-force established a beachhead at (Vettilaikkerni). After several days of fighting the relief force was able to reach and linkup with the besieged garrison and by 19 August the LTTE militants withdrew. During the month-long battle which was the longest yet in the war, 573 LTTE carders and 202 military personnel had been killed. In the end of August, General Kobbekaduwa launched &quot;Operation Lightning&quot; in the Weli-oya sector to divert pressure on Elephant Pass. Several LTTE camps were destroyed while other operations disrupted LTTE supply lines in the area where the Mannar coast was linked to the Wanni jungle base.

== Death ==
===Operation Final Count Down===
In July 1992, General Kobbekaduwa returned to Colombo for his father&#x27;s funeral. This was when he was preparing for a new offensive to capture the Jaffna peninsula which was under LTTE control, it was code named &quot;Operation Final Count Down&quot;. On 2 August 1992 he was back in Colombo and met with President Ranasinghe Premadasa. He returned to his HQ in Palaly the next day. Since the launching pad for the offensive was the island of Kayts on 7 August, General Kobbekaduwa moved to Karainagar naval base by helicopter with his staff. He spent much of the night planning the upcoming offensive with Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne, Jaffna Brigade Commander and Commodore Mohan Jayamaha. Due to concerns of the navy about the staging area, it was decided to visit the Araly point the next day.

=== Araly Point ===

On 8 August 1992 at 8.00 am the group made up of Maj. General Kobbekaduwa, Brigadier Wimalaratne and Commodore Jayamaha along with several other officers headed out on a naval patrol boat towards Jaffna and returned to Kayts pier. On returning the party was met by three Land Rovers, the General, the Brigadier and the Commodore got into the Land Rover UHA 8752 with the rest of the army personnel taking vehicle no UHA 8785 and the naval personnel taking 5959. From there they set out to Araly Point. Half way the general order that they all use one vehicle as to not to attract fire from LTTE units in the Jaffna peninsula which was only one-half kilometer away. They reached Araly Point and had a discussion and headed back when the Land Rover was consumed by an explosion. Major Rupasinghe and Major Induruwa who were 400 yards away from the incident ran to the location to find only General Kobbekaduwa and Commodore Jayamaha alive. Killed in the explosion was Brigadier Wimalaratne, Lt. Colonels G.H. Ariyaratne, A. Palipahana, H.R. Stephen, all three battalion commanders, Lieutenant Commander Asanga Lankathilaka, Lieutenant Commander C.B Wijepura, Major Nalin S. De Alwis; the General&#x27;s Aide-de-camp and Corporal Jagath Wickramaratna. The two wounded officers were rushed to the helicopter waiting to transport the group to base, which took them to the military hospital in Plalay where Commodore Jayamaha was found dead on arrival. General Kobbekaduwa who was awake was then transferred to the Colombo General Hospital for surgery via helicopter; where a specialist team of surgeons were unable to save his life. It has been claimed by Jane&#x27;s Information Group that the assassination was by the LTTE.

=== Funeral ===
On the day of his military funeral, a crowd numbering about 100,000 persons descended on the Colombo general cemetery, chanting anti-government slogans and throwing stones at government ministers. At least fifteen people were injured, including two ministers, deputy Foreign Minister John Amaratunga and deputy Information Minister A.J. Ranasinghe. According to witnesses, the crowd was angry because the general was not given a state funeral. Police in riot gear responded by firing shots and tear-gas into the air to disperse the crowd.

=== Commissions of inquiry ===
Lalini Kobbekaduwa, the General Kobbekaduwa&#x27;s widow, called for an international commission into the incident. This was not granted, but the Sri Lankan Government set up their own commission to investigate. President Premadasa appointed a one man commission comprising Justice Ameer Ismail. Additional Solicitor General Upawansa Yapa was later appointed to assist. Following her election to office, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry, made up of Tissa Dias Bandaranayake (Chair), Justice D. P. S. Gunasekera and Gamini Ameratunga, High Court Judge. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake was a close relative of the president. A witness, Rohini Hathurusinghe gave evidence that Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne and Major General Ananda Weerasekara conspired to kill Kobbekaduwa with a bomb planted in his jeep, which caused a major national scandal. A report from the Criminal Investigation Department found Hathurusinghe&#x27;s evidence could not be corroborated, yet Bandaranayake allowed her testimony. Justice Gunasekera and Ameratunga resigned from the commission. Televised, the commissioned became a media sensation and a statue of Wimalaratne was destroyed by a mob. Hathurusinghe changed her story and accused the Chairmen of the commission of getting her to falsely accuse the army officers. Although the validity of Hathurusinghe&#x27;s evidence was questioned, the Presidential Commission speculated that then President Ranasinghe Premadasa, as well as members of the Sri Lankan Army such as Major W A N M Weerasinghe, were &quot;directly responsible&quot; for his death. The &quot;Asia Times&quot; commented that &quot;a second and last Presidential Commission came up with highly speculative conclusions.&quot;

==Legacy==
General Kobbekaduwa is considered as a loved and respectfully leader among Sri Lankan Army and the entire Sri Lankan community. He was admired for his kindness, humanity and his affection for his troops. Several statues of General Kobbekaduwa were erected following his death, along with several roads named after him.

==Awards and decorations==
During his career he received the Republic of Sri Lanka Armed Services Medal, Sri Lanka Army 25th Anniversary Medal, President&#x27;s Inauguration Medal, Sri Lanka Armed Services Long Service Medal, Vadamarachchi Operation Medal, Purna Bhumi Padakkama and Rana Wickrama Padakkama.

<doc id="1046923" wikidata="Q6718887" url="?curid=1046923" title="New Testament apocrypha">
<text>The New Testament apocrypha (singular apocryphon) are a number of writings by early Christians that give accounts of Jesus and his teachings, the nature of God, or the teachings of his apostles and of their lives. Some of these writings were cited as scripture by early Christians, but since the fifth century a widespread consensus has emerged limiting the New Testament to the 27 books of the modern canon. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches generally do not view the New Testament apocrypha as part of the Bible.

==Definition==
The word &quot;apocrypha&quot; means &#x27;things put away&#x27; or &#x27;things hidden&#x27;, originating from the Medieval Latin adjective , &#x27;secret&#x27; or &#x27;non-canonical&#x27;, which in turn originated from the Greek adjective (), &#x27;obscure&#x27;, from the verb (), &#x27;to hide away&#x27;. in turn comes from the Greek prefix , meaning &#x27;away&#x27;, and the Greek verb , meaning &#x27;to hide&#x27;.

The general term is usually applied to the books that were considered by the church as useful, but not divinely inspired. As such, to refer to Gnostic writings as &quot;apocryphal&quot; is misleading since they would not be classified in the same category by orthodox believers. Often used by the Greek Fathers was the term antilegomena, or &#x27;spoken against&#x27;, although some canonical books were also spoken against, such as the Apocalypse of John in the East. Often used by scholars is the term pseudepigrapha, meaning &#x27;falsely inscribed&#x27; or &#x27;falsely attributed&#x27;, in the sense that the writings were written by an anonymous author who appended the name of an apostle to his work, such as in the Gospel of Peter or the Ethiopic Apocalypse of Enoch: almost all books, in both Old and New Testaments, called &quot;apocrypha&quot; in the Protestant tradition are pseudepigrapha. In the Catholic and Orthodox traditions, what are called the apocrypha by Protestants include the deuterocanonical books: in the Catholic tradition, the term &quot;apocrypha&quot; is synonymous with what Protestants would call the pseudepigrapha, the latter term of which is almost exclusively used by scholars.

==History==

===Development of the New Testament canon===
That some works are categorized as New Testament apocrypha is indicative of the wide range of responses to the ministry of Jesus. During the first centuries following Jesus&#x27; ministry, considerable debate was held in regards to safeguarding the authenticity of his teachings. Three key methods developed to address this survive to the present day: ordination, where groups authorize individuals as reliable teachers of the message; creeds, where groups define the boundaries of interpretation of the message; and canons, which list the primary documents certain groups believe contain the message originally taught by Jesus.

The first centuries of Christianity saw substantial debate in regards to which books should be included in the canons. In general, those books that the majority regarded as the earliest books about Jesus were the ones included. Books that were not accepted into the canons are now termed &quot;apocryphal&quot;; some were vigorously suppressed and survive only as fragments, or only in mention in the writings of those condemning them. The earliest lists of canonical works of the New Testament were not quite the same as modern lists; for example, the Book of Revelation was regarded as disputed by some Christians (see Antilegomena), while the Shepherd of Hermas was considered genuine by others, and appears (after the Book of Revelation) in the Codex Sinaiticus.

The Syriac Peshitta, used by all the various Syrian churches, originally did not include 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation. This canon of 22 books is the one cited by John Chrysostom (~347–407) and Theodoret (393–466) from the School of Antioch. Western Syrians have added the remaining five books to their New Testament canons in modern times (such as the &quot;Lee Peshitta&quot; of 1823). Today, the official lectionaries followed by the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church and the East Syriac Chaldean Catholic Church, which is in communion with the Holy See, still only present lessons from the 22 books of the original Peshitta.

The Armenian Apostolic church at times has included the Third Epistle to the Corinthians in its biblical canon, but does not always list it with the other 27 canonical New Testament books. The church did not accept Revelation into its Bible until 1200 CE.

===Modern scholarship and translation===
English translations were made in the early 18th century by William Wake and by Jeremiah Jones, and collected in 1820 by William Hone&#x27;s &quot;Apocryphal New Testament&quot;. The series &quot;Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot;, volume 8, contains translations by Alexander Walker. New translations by M. R. James appeared in 1924, and were revised by J.K. Eliott, &quot;The Apocryphal New Testament&quot;, Oxford University Press, 1991. The &quot;standard&quot; scholarly edition of the New Testament Apocrypha in German is that of Schneemelcher, and in English its translation by Robert McLachlan Wilson.

Constantin von Tischendorf and other scholars began to study New Testament apocrypha seriously in the 19th century and produce new translations. The texts of the Nag Hammadi library are often considered separately but the current edition of Schneemelcher also contains eleven Nag Hammadi texts.

Books that are known objectively not to have existed in antiquity are usually not considered part of the New Testament apocrypha. Among these are the Libellus de Nativitate Sanctae Mariae (also called the &quot;Nativity of Mary&quot;) and the Latin Infancy gospel. The latter two did not exist in antiquity, and they seem to be based on the earlier Infancy gospels.

==Gospels==
===Infancy gospels===
 Information about the childhood of Jesus was supplied by a number of 2nd-century and later texts, known as infancy gospels, none of which were accepted into the biblical canon. Despite this, some scholars have noted that the very number of surviving infancy manuscripts attests to their continued popularity.

Most of these manuscripts were based on the earliest infancy gospels, namely the Infancy Gospel of James (also called the &quot;Protoevangelium of James&quot;) and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, and on their later combination into the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew (also called the &quot;Infancy Gospel of Matthew&quot; or &quot;Birth of Mary and Infancy of the Saviour&quot;).

The other significant early infancy gospels are the Syriac Infancy Gospel, the History of Joseph the Carpenter, and the Life of John the Baptist.

===Jewish-Christian gospels===
The Jewish–Christian Gospels were gospels of a Jewish Christian character quoted by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Jerome and probably Didymus the Blind. Most modern scholars have concluded that there existed one gospel in Aramaic/Hebrew and at least two in Greek, although a minority argue that there were only two: one Aramaic/Hebrew and one Greek.

None of these gospels survive today, but attempts have been made to reconstruct them from references in the Church Fathers. The reconstructed texts of the gospels are usually categorized under New Testament Apocrypha. The standard edition of Schneemelcher describes the texts of three Jewish–Christian gospels as follows:
:1) The Gospel of the Ebionites (&quot;GE&quot;) – 7 quotations by Epiphanius.
:2) The Gospel of the Hebrews (&quot;GH&quot;) – 1 quotation ascribed to Cyril of Jerusalem, plus GH 2–7 quotations by Clement, Origen, and Jerome.
:3) The Gospel of the Nazarenes (&quot;GN&quot;) – GN 1 to GN 23 are mainly from Jerome; GN 24 to GN 36 are from medieval sources.

Some scholars consider that the two last named are in fact the same source.

===Non-canonical gospels===

* Gospel of Marcion (mid-2nd century)
* Gospel of Mani (3rd century)
* Gospel of Apelles (midlate 2nd century, similar to Marcion)
* Gospel of Bardesanes (late 2ndearly 3rd century)
* Gospel of Basilides (mid-2nd century)
* Gospel of Thomas (1st century; sayings gospel)

===Passion Gospels===

A number of gospels are concerned specifically with the &quot;Passion&quot; (from the Latin verb &quot;patior, passus sum&quot;; &quot;to suffer, bear, endure&quot;, from which also &quot;patience, patient&quot;, etc.)) of Jesus:
* Gospel of Peter
* Gospel of Nicodemus (also called the &quot;Acts of Pilate&quot;)
* Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem, &quot;On the Life and the Passion of Christ&quot;
* Gospel of Bartholomew
* &quot;Questions of Bartholomew&quot;
* &quot;Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, by Bartholomew the Apostle&quot;

Although three texts take Bartholomew&#x27;s name, it may be that either the &quot;Questions of Bartholomew&quot; or the &quot;Resurrection of Jesus Christ&quot; is in fact the unknown &quot;Gospel of Bartholomew&quot;.

===Harmonized gospels===
A number of texts aim to provide a single harmonization of the canonical gospels, that eliminates discordances among them by presenting a unified text derived from them to some degree. The most widely read of these was the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;.

==Gnostic texts==

In the modern era, many Gnostic texts have been uncovered, especially from the Nag Hammadi library. Some texts take the form of an expounding of the esoteric cosmology and ethics held by the Gnostics. Often this was in the form of dialogue in which Jesus expounds esoteric knowledge while his disciples raise questions concerning it. There is also a text, known as the Epistula Apostolorum, which is a polemic against Gnostic esoterica, but written in a similar style as the Gnostic texts.

===Dialogues with Jesus===
*Apocryphon of James (also called the &quot;Secret Book of James&quot;)
*Book of Thomas the Contender
*Dialogue of the Saviour
*Gospel of Judas (also called the &quot;Gospel of Judas Iscariot&quot;)
*Gospel of Mary
*Gospel of Philip
*Greek Gospel of the Egyptians (distinct from the Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians)
*The Sophia of Jesus Christ

===General texts concerning Jesus===
*Coptic Apocalypse of Paul (distinct from the Apocalypse of Paul)
*Gospel of Truth
*Gnostic Apocalypse of Peter (distinct from the Apocalypse of Peter)
*Letter of Lentulus
*Pistis Sophia
*Second Treatise of the Great Seth

===Sethian texts concerning Jesus===
The Sethians were a gnostic group who originally worshipped the biblical Seth as a messianic figure, later treating Jesus as a re-incarnation of Seth. They produced numerous texts expounding their esoteric cosmology, usually in the form of visions:

*Apocryphon of John (also called the &quot;Secret Gospel of John&quot;)
*Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians (distinct from the Greek Gospel of the Egyptians)
*Trimorphic Protennoia

===Ritual diagrams===
Some of the Gnostic texts appear to consist of diagrams and instructions for use in religious rituals:
*Ophite Diagrams
*Books of Jeu

==Acts==

Several texts concern themselves with the subsequent lives of the apostles, usually with highly supernatural events. Almost half of these, anciently called &quot;The Circuits of the Apostles&quot; and now known by the name of their purported author, &quot;Leucius Charinus&quot; (supposedly a companion of John the apostle), contained the Acts of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas, and Paul. These were judged by the Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople in the ninth century to be full of folly, self-contradiction, falsehood, and impiety. The &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; and the &quot;Acts of Peter and the Twelve&quot; are often considered Gnostic texts. While most of the texts are believed to have been written in the 2nd century, at least two, the &quot;Acts of Barnabas&quot; and the &quot;Acts of Peter and Paul&quot; are believed to have been written as late as the 5th century.

* Acts of Andrew
* Acts of Barnabas
* Acts of John
* Acts of Mar Mari
* Acts of the Martyrs
* Acts of Paul
* Acts of Paul and Thecla
* Acts of Peter
* Acts of Peter and Andrew
* Acts of Peter and Paul
* Acts of Peter and the Twelve
* Acts of Philip
* Acts of Pilate
* Acts of Thomas
* Acts of Timothy
* Acts of Xanthippe, Polyxena, and Rebecca
* The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles

==Epistles==

There are also non-canonical epistles (or &quot;letters&quot;) between individuals or to Christians in general. Some of them were regarded very highly by the early church.
Those marked with a lozenge (♦) are included in the collection known as the Apostolic Fathers:

*Epistle of Barnabas ♦
*First Epistle of Clement ♦
*Second Epistle of Clement ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp ♦
*Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians ♦
*Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus ♦
*Martyrdom of Polycarp ♦
*Epistle to the Laodiceans (an epistle in the name of Paul)
*Epistle to Seneca the Younger (an epistle in the name of Paul)
*Third Epistle to the Corinthians - accepted in the past by some in the Armenian Orthodox church.

==Apocalypses==
Several works frame themselves as visions, often discussing the future, afterlife, or both:

*Apocalypse of Paul (distinct from the Coptic Apocalypse of Paul, also called Apocalypse of the Virgin)
*Apocalypse of Peter (distinct from the Gnostic Apocalypse of Peter)
*Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius
*Apocalypse of Thomas (also called the &quot;Revelation of Thomas&quot;)
*Apocalypse of Stephen (also called the &quot;Revelation of Stephen&quot;)
*Arabic Apocalypse of Peter
*First Apocalypse of James (also called the &quot;First Revelation of James&quot;)
*Second Apocalypse of James (also called the &quot;Second Revelation of James&quot;)
*Second Apocalypse of John (also called the &quot;[First] Apocryphal Apocalypse of John&quot;)
*The Shepherd of Hermas (also included in the collection known as the Apostolic Fathers)

==Fate of Mary==
Several texts (over 50) consist of descriptions of the events surrounding the varied fate of Mary (the mother of Jesus):

*The Home Going of Mary
*The Falling Asleep of the Mother of God
*The Descent of Mary

==Miscellany==
These texts, due to their content or form, do not fit into the other categories:

*Apostolic Constitutions (church regulations supposedly asserted by the apostles)
*Book of Nepos
*Canons of the Apostles
*Cave of Treasures (also called &quot;The Treasure&quot;)
*Clementine literature
*Didache (possibly the first written catechism) (also included in the collection known as the Apostolic Fathers.)
*Liturgy of St James
*Penitence of Origen
*Prayer of Paul
*Sentences of Sextus
*Physiologus
*Book of the Bee

==Fragments==
In addition to the known apocryphal works, there are also small fragments of texts, parts of unknown (or uncertain) works. Some of the more significant fragments are:

*The Gospel of the Saviour
*The Naassene Fragment
*The Fayyum Fragment
*The Secret Gospel of Mark, whose authenticity has been challenged
*The Oxyrhynchus Gospels
*The Egerton Gospel

== Lost works ==
Several texts are mentioned in many ancient sources and would probably be considered part of the apocrypha, but no known text has survived:

*Gospel of Eve (a quotation from this gospel is given by Epiphanius (&quot;Haer.&quot; xxvi. 2, 3). It is possible that this is the Gospel of Perfection he alludes to in xxvi. 2. The quotation shows that this gospel was the expression of complete pantheism)
*Gospel of the Four Heavenly Realms
*Gospel of Matthias (probably different from the Gospel of Matthew)
*Gospel of Perfection (used by the followers of Basilides and other Gnostics. See Epiphanius, &quot;Haer.&quot; xxvi. 2)
*Gospel of the Seventy
*Gospel of Thaddaeus (This may be a synonym for the Gospel of Judas. The name Thaddeus was often used to not to confuse Jude the Apostle for Judas Iscariot)
*Gospel of the Twelve
*Memoria Apostolorum

== Close candidates for canonization ==
While many of the books listed here were considered heretical (especially those belonging to the gnostic tradition—as this sect was considered heretical by Proto-orthodox Christianity of the early centuries), others were not considered particularly heretical in content, but in fact were well accepted as significant spiritual works. Those marked with a lozenge (♦) are also included in the collection known as the Apostolic Fathers.

While some of the following works appear in complete Bibles from the fourth century, such as 1 Clement and The Shepherd of Hermas, showing their general popularity, they were not included when the canon was formally decided at the end of that century.
*Epistle of Barnabas ♦
*First Epistle of Clement ♦
*Second Epistle of Clement ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians ♦
*Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp ♦
*Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians ♦
*Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus ♦
*Martyrdom of Polycarp ♦
*Shepherd of Hermas ♦
*Didache ♦
*Apocalypse of Peter
*Third Epistle to the Corinthians

==Evaluation==

=== Present day ===
Among historians of early Christianity, the books are considered invaluable, especially those that almost made it into the final canon, such as Shepherd of Hermas. Bart Ehrman, for example, said:

The victors in the struggles to establish Christian Orthodoxy not only won their theological battles, they also rewrote the history of the conflict; later readers then naturally assumed that the victorious views had been embraced by the vast majority of Christians from the very beginning ... The practice of Christian forgery has a long and distinguished history ... the debate lasted three hundred years ... even within &quot;orthodox&quot; circles there was considerable debate concerning which books to include.

=== Historical development towards today&#x27;s canon ===
The historical debate primarily concerned whether certain works should be read in the church service or only privately. These works were widely used but not necessarily considered &quot;Catholic&quot; or &#x27;universal.&#x27; Such works include the Didache, Shepherd of Hermas, 1 Clement, 2 Clement, the Epistle of Barnabas, and to a lesser extent the Apocalypse of Peter.

Considering the generally accepted dates of authorship for all of the canonical New Testament works (), as well as the various witnesses to canonicity extant among the writings of Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenaeus, etc., the four gospels and letters of Paul were held by the gentile Christian community as scriptural, and 200 years were needed to finalize the canon; from the beginning of the 2nd Century to the mid-4th Century, no book in the final canon was ever declared spurious or heretical, except for the Revelation of John which the Council of Laodicea in 363–364 CE rejected (although it accepted all of the other 26 books in the New Testament). This was possibly due to fears of the influence of Montanism which used the book extensively to support their theology. See Revelation of John for more details.

Athanasius wrote his Easter letter in 367 CE which defined a canon of 27 books, identical to the current canon, but also listed two works that were &quot;not in the canon but to be read:&quot; The Shepherd of Hermas and the Didache. Nevertheless, the early church leaders in the 3rd and 4th Centuries generally distinguished between canonical works and those that were not canonical but &#x27;useful,&#x27; or &#x27;good for teaching,&#x27; though never relegating any of the final 27 books to the latter category. One aim with establishing the canon was to capture only those works which were held to have been written by the Apostles, or their close associates, and as the Muratorian fragment canon (ca. 150–175 CE) states concerning the Shepherd of Hermas:

...But Hermas wrote The Shepherd very recently, in our times, in the city of Rome, while bishop Pius, his brother, was occupying the chair of the church of the city of Rome. And therefore it ought indeed to be read; but it cannot be read publicly to the people in church either among the Prophets, whose number is complete, or among the Apostles, for it is after their time.

<text>Thomas Weelkes (1576 (?) – 1623) was an English composer and organist. He became organist of Winchester College in 1598, moving to Chichester Cathedral. His works are chiefly vocal, and include madrigals, anthems and services.

==Life==

There is no documentary evidence about Weelkes&#x27;s early years. According to the biographer David Brown, circumstantial evidence points to the possibility that Weelkes was a son of John Weeke, rector of Elsted in Sussex and his wife Johanne. If this was so, the boy was the Thomas Weeke baptised at Elsted on 25 October 1576; he had at least five siblings. Brown adds that there is no firmer evidence about Weelkes&#x27;s childhood and musical training, although one piece of information is found in the preface to Weelkes’s collection &quot;Ballets and Madrigals&quot; (1598), where he states that he had been in the service of &quot;his master Edward Darcy Esquire, Groom to her Majesty’s Privy Chamber&quot;. In the preface to his first volume of madrigals (1597) Weelkes states that he was a very young man at the time of their composition – &quot;my yeeres yet unripened&quot; – which, in Brown&#x27;s view, confirms that he was born in the middle or later 1570s. By 1597 Weelkes, by his own account, had enjoyed the &quot;undeserved love, and liberall good will&quot; of George Phillpot, who lived at Compton, near Winchester. Towards the end of 1598 he was appointed organist of Winchester College at a salary of 13s. 4d. a quarter, with board and lodging.

Weelkes remained at the college for three or four years, and, according to Brown, during this period he composed his finest madrigals. They appeared in two volumes (1598 and 1600); Brown calls the second – works for five and six voices – &quot;one of the most important volumes in the English madrigal tradition.&quot;

At some time between October 1601 and October 1602 Weelkes joined the choir of Chichester Cathedral as organist and &quot;&quot; (instructor of the choristers) with, in addition, a well-paid lay-clerkship. He obtained the degree of Bachelor of Music from New College, Oxford in July 1602. On 20 February he 1603 married Elizabeth Sandham, the daughter of a wealthy Chichester merchant; they had at least three children.

On the title page of Weelkes&#x27;s fourth and final volume of madrigals, published in 1608, he refers to himself as a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. The records at the Chapel Royal do not mention him, but the musicologist Walter S. Collins observes, &quot;one would hardly dare publish such a claim if it were not true&quot;. Brown infers that Wilkes may have been a Gentleman Extraordinary – a temporary rather than a permanent appointment.

While Weelkes was at Chichester members of its choir were often in trouble with the authorities for poor behaviour. As the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography puts it, Weelkes &quot;was not the only disorderly member of the cathedral establishment, though in due course he would become its most celebrated.&quot; In 1609 he was charged with unauthorised absence from Chichester, but no mention of drunken behaviour is made until 1613, and in &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; John Shepherd has suggested caution in assuming that Weelkes&#x27;s decline began before that date.

In 1616 Weelkes was reported to the bishop for being &quot;noted and famed for a comon and notorious swearer &amp; blasphemer&quot;. The Dean and Chapter dismissed him for being drunk at the organ and using bad language during divine service. He was reinstated and remained in the post until his death, although his behaviour did not improve; in 1619 he was again reported to the bishop:

In 1622 Elizabeth Weelkes died. Weelkes was, by this time, reinstated at Chichester Cathedral, but appears to have been spending a great deal of time in London. He died in London in 1623, in the house of a friend and was buried on 1 December 1623 at St Bride&#x27;s Fleet Street. His will, made the day before he died at the house of his friend Henry Drinkwater of St Bride&#x27;s parish, left his estate to be shared between his three children, with a 50-shilling legacy left to Drinkwater for his meat, drink and lodging.

==Music==

Weelkes is best known for his vocal music, especially his madrigals and church music. He wrote more Anglican services than any other major composer of the time, mostly for evensong. Many of his anthems are verse anthems, which would have suited the small forces available at Chichester Cathedral. It has been suggested that larger-scale pieces were intended for the Chapel Royal. His coronation anthem, &quot;O Lord, grant the King a long life&quot;, was performed at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023.

Only a small amount of instrumental music was written by Weelkes, and it is rarely performed. His consort music is sombre in tone, contrasting with the often gleeful madrigals.

===Madrigals===

Weelkes&#x27;s madrigals are often compared to those of John Wilbye (who the Dictionary of National Biography described as the most famous of the English madrigalists): it has been suggested that the personalities of the two men - Wilbye appears to have been a more sober character than Weelkes - are reflected in the music. Both men were interested in word painting. Weelkes&#x27; madrigals are very chromatic and use varied organic counterpoint and unconventional rhythm in their construction.

Weelkes was friendly with the madrigalist Thomas Morley who died in 1602, when Weelkes was in his mid-twenties (Weelkes commemorated his death in a madrigal-form anthem titled &quot;A Remembrance of my Friend Thomas Morley&quot;, also known as &quot;Death hath Deprived Me&quot;). Some of Weelkes&#x27;s madrigals were reprinted in popular collections during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but none of his verse anthems were printed until 1966, since when he has become recognised as one of the most important church composers of his time.

<text>Major General Vanigamuni Indrajith Vijeyakumar Mendis Wimalaratne, RWP, RSP, VSV, USP (; 25 August 1940 – 8 August 1992) was a senior Sri Lanka Army officer. One of the most distinguished field commanders in Sri Lanka, Wimalaratne raised the Gajaba Regiment. He commanded the 1st Brigade during the Vadamarachchi Operation, the Amphibious Task Force Commander during Operation Balavegaya, and was the Commander Security Forces – Jaffna at the time of his death in a landmine explosion at Point Arali in the Kayts Island while making preparations to re-capture Jaffna.

==Early life and education==
Born on 25 August 1940, second of a family of eight boys, Wimalaratne was educated at Royal College, Colombo.

==Military career==
===Early career===
Wimalaratne joined the Ceylon Army as an Officer Cadet in August 1962 and underwent training at the Indian Military Academy, in Dehradun as part of the first batch of four Ceylonese cadets sent to Dehradun. There he was the first foreign cadet to be appointed Battalion Cadet Adjutant in his final term. On his return, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the newly formed Gemunu Watch on 1 August 1963, leaving soon after for a jungle warfare course in Malaysia at the British Army Jungle Warfare Training School. Serving with the 1st Battalion, Gemunu Watch as a subaltern, he was appointed adjutant of the 2nd (Volunteer) Battalion, Gemunu Watch in 1968. In 1970, he was appointed as an instructor conducting the jungle warfare phase for Officer Cadets at the Army Training Center (ATC) in Diyatalawa. He served till 1979 becoming the Chief Instructor of the Army Training Center, having introduced training on urban warfare and counter-insurgency. In 1976, Major Wimalaratne served as the liaison officer to the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when she took part in the Non-Aligned Summit in Colombo. He attended the British Army Staff College at Camberley.

===Gajaba Regiment===
In 1983, Major Wimalaratne was appointed as the first commanding officer of the Gajaba Regiment when it was formed on 14 October 1983 with the amalgamation of the Rajarata Rifles and Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment at the Saliyapura Army Camp. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, he played a major role in forming and expanding the Gajaba Regiment as one of the elite infantry regiments in the army and is remembered as its founder. Wimalaratne served as the commanding office the 1st Gajaba Battalion from its formation in October 1983 to August 1987. The 1st Gajaba Battalion was deployed to the Jaffna peninsula between 1983 and 1984 and again in 1985 with the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War. In addition, during this time Wimalaratne served as Acting Commander, North Central Command and Deputy Commander (Operations), Security Forces Jaffna. In 1985, he help initiate the Army Special Forces program having established the first Special Forces Squadrons.

===Operation Liberation===

Operation Liberation (commonly known as the Vadamarachchi Operation) was launched after months of planning on 26 May 1987. Colonel Wimalaratne was one of the field commanders of the operation, serving as the Brigade Commander of the 1st Brigade which consisted of the 1st Gemunu Watch and 1st Gajaba Battalion. The brigade group consisting of the 1st Brigade and 3rd Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Denzil Kobbekaduwa it was the largest formation deployed by the Sri Lankan Army at that point and the first conventional battle to take place in the civil war. The objective was to take the territory of Vadamarachchi in the Jaffna peninsula from LTTE (Tamil Tiger) control. 1st Brigade broke-out of Thondamanaru area with the infantry wading across the lagoon, but was stopped by a mine-field. With the combat engineers clearing a path across, 1st Gajaba Battalion broke-out and reaching the coast, troops from the 1st Brigade defeating the defensive line commanded by the LTTE leader Soosai, made a 90 degree turn undertaking a pincer movement capturing Valvettithurai. By 31 May, the government declared that the Vadamarachchi region recaptured. During the operation Kobbekaduwa and Wimalaratne were nearly killed when the house closed to them exploded due to a bobby-trap.

===JVP Insurrection===
With the second phase of Operation Liberation being abandoned with the Indian intervention by Operation Poomalai and the arrival of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), the 1987–1989 JVP insurrection began in the south of the country. Colonel Wimalaratne was appointed Commander, Garrison Command - Colombo; in charge of defense of the capital in late 1987. In 1988, he received concurrent appointment as the Principal Staff Officer, Joint Operations Command (JOC) and serving as its Director Operations. He held both posts until the insurrection was subdued in late 1989 with the capture of the leader of the JVP.

===Northern front===

Promoted to brigadier, he volunteered to take up command in Jaffna under Major General Kobbekaduwa, who was the general officer commanding, 2nd Division with the resumption of hostilities after the IPKF withdrew. In June 1990, the LTTE laid siege around Jaffna Fort and Wimalaratne played a major role in evacuating the garrison. The army had nominated Wimalaratne for the National Security and Strategic Study course at the National Defence College in India, however he had turned down the opportunity to remain in the front. On 10 July 1991 the LTTE launched a surprise attack on the strategic base of Elephant Pass and laid siege to the garrison. The Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Hamilton Wanasinghe appointed Wimalaratne as the Amphibious Task Force Commander in the Operation Balavegaya which was going to be the first amphibious operation undertaken by the Sri Lanka Army. Under the Overall Command of Major General Kobbekaduwa, Wimalaratne lead the Amphibious Task Force on a successful landing in the evening of 15 July 1991 after the first attempt was delayed due to heavy resistance from the enemy. The task force broke out of the breach head and move 12 miles to relieve the siege of the garrison. During the operation, Wimalaratne was almost killed when an LTTE mortar landed in the spot he had been standing minutes prior. In January 1991, Brigadier Wimalaratne succeeded Brigadier Jaliya Nanmuni as Brigade Commander, 21 &quot;Jaffna&quot; Brigade.

==Death==

In July 1992, Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa who was now General Officer Commanding Northern Sector and Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne who was the Commander, 21 &quot;Jaffna&quot; Brigade, began planning an offensive code named &quot;Operation Final Countdown&quot; to recapture the northern peninsula from the LTTE. Final preparations were underway and the senior commanders decided to visit Araly Point on Kayts which was the launching pad for the offensive. According to the official statement by the army, on their return, the Land Rover driven by Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne was destroyed by a land mine blast. Brigadier Wimalaratne was killed instantly along with Commodore (posthumously Rear Admiral) Mohan Jayamaha, Commander Northern Naval Area and seven others including Commander Asanga Lankathilaka, Lt. Colonels G.H. Ariyaratne, A. Palipahana, H.R. Stephen, all three battalion commanders and Major N.S. De Alwis, General Kobbekaduwa&#x27;s ADC. General Kobbekaduwa was found alive but critically wounded and transferred by helicopter to Colombo where he succumbed to his wounds. It has been claimed by Jane&#x27;s Information Group that the assassination was by the LTTE.

===Funeral===
Wimalaratne&#x27;s remains were brought to Colombo and kept at his brother&#x27;s residence for mourning. The funeral took place at the Colombo General Cemetery with full military honors. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of major general.

==Legacy==
General Vijaya Wimalaratne is considered as the founder of the Gajaba Regiment and one of the finest field commanders of the Sri Lanka Army. A statue of General Vijaya Wimalaratne was erected at Kiribathgoda Town.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga, appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry, made up of Tissa Dias Bandaranayake (Chair), Justice D. P. S. Gunasekera and Gamini Ameratunga, High Court Judge to investigate the death of General Kobbekaduwa. A witness, Rohini Hathurusinghe gave evidence that Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne and Major General Ananda Weerasekara conspired to kill Kobbekaduwa with a bomb planted in his jeep, which caused a major national scandal. A report from the Criminal Investigation Department found Hathurusinghe&#x27;s evidence could not be corroborated, yet Bandaranayake allowed her testimony. Justice Gunasekera and Ameratunga resigned from the commission. Televised, the commissioned became a media sensation and a statue of Wimalaratne was destroyed by a mob. Hathurusinghe changed her story and accused the Chairmen of the commission of getting her to falsely accuse the army officers. Although the validity of Hathurusinghe&#x27;s evidence was questioned, The &quot;Asia Times&quot; commented that &quot;a second and last Presidential Commission came up with highly speculative conclusions.&quot;

==Awards and decorations==
Wimalaratne had been awarded the Rana Wickrama Padakkama and Rana Sura Padakkama for gallantry and the Republic of Sri Lanka Armed Services Medal, Army 25th Anniversary Medal, President&#x27;s Inauguration Medal, Sri Lanka Armed Services Long Service Medal, Vadamarachchi Operation Medal and the Purna Bhumi Padakkama.

<text>Indiana Institute of Technology (Indiana Tech) is a private university in Fort Wayne, Indiana. It was founded in 1930 as Indiana Technical College by John A. Kalbfleisch, who was also the school&#x27;s first president.

The university today is organized into three colleges. The university specializes in career-oriented degree programs in business, engineering, computer science, education, criminal justice, and others. In addition to the traditional semester-long class format, Indiana Tech also offers accelerated degree programs and online programs via its College of Professional Studies.

Beyond its main campus in Fort Wayne, Indiana Tech maintains regional classroom and enrollment centers in 13 locations, including Elkhart, Evansville, Fishers, Greenwood, Huntington, Indianapolis, Jeffersonville, Kendallville, Mishawaka, Munster, and Warsaw in Indiana; and Louisville and Fort Wright in Kentucky. Indiana Tech also has two enrollment centers in the Chicago area, located in Naperville and Wilmette, Illinois.

Student athletics, both organized and intramural, are an important part of student life. Indiana Tech fields eleven men&#x27;s and eleven women&#x27;s teams that compete in the NAIA, in which Indiana Tech is a member of the Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference for all intercollegiate athletics.

==History==
The Indiana Institute of Technology was founded as Indiana Technical College in 1930 as a for-profit private technical college by John A. Kalbfleisch, a former president of Indiana Business College, a for-profit business school. Indiana Tech was formally incorporated in 1931 and opened for classes that same year. The school was rechartered in August 1948 as a non-profit, endowed college.

In 1953, Indiana Tech purchased the campus of Concordia College, east of downtown Fort Wayne, from the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod as that school was being replaced by Concordia Senior College in a new suburban location north of the city. In 1963, Indiana Tech&#x27;s name was changed from Indiana Technical College to Indiana Institute of Technology.

==Academics==
Indiana Tech offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.

Indiana Tech is organized into the following colleges:

* College of Business
* Talwar College of Engineering and Computer Sciences
* College of Arts and Sciences

===Former law school===
Indiana Tech Law School began classes in the Fall semester of 2013. The American Bar Association (ABA) granted provisional accreditation to Indiana Tech Law School as of March 12, 2016. Indiana Tech had to maintain provisional accreditation for a minimum of two years prior to seeking full ABA accreditation. However, due to the stated loss of nearly $20 million in operating losses with anticipated higher losses in the future, the Indiana Tech Board of Trustees voted unanimously to cease operation of the law school effective June 30, 2017.

===Accreditation===

Indiana Tech is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, while the biomedical, mechanical, computer and electrical engineering programs are also accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), the College of Business has received specialized accreditation for its business programs through the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), and the Health Information Technology and Health Information Management Programs are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM).

==Athletics==
The Indiana Tech athletic teams are called the Warriors. The school&#x27;s colors are orange and black with white accent. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) for most of its sports since the 1998–99 academic year; while its women&#x27;s wrestling team competes in the Mid-South Conference (MSC); and its ice hockey team competes in Varsity Division and Division III of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). The Warriors previously competed in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) from about 1978–79 to 1997–98; and in the Mid-Central College Conference (MCCC; now currently known as the Crossroads League since the 2012–13 school year) from 1959–60 to 1977–78.

Indiana Tech competes in 26 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, rugby, and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and wrestling; and co-ed sports include eSports.

===Accomplishments===
Indiana Tech athletes have achieved notable success at the individual and team levels. Warrior teams have won 11 national titles, including in women&#x27;s lacrosse and most recently in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field, with the Warrior men earning four straight NAIA national titles starting with the 2013 outdoor national championship. The women&#x27;s track and field team has been similarly dominant, with the team earning back-to-back outdoor NAIA national titles in 2013 and 2014.

Over the years, Indiana Tech teams have collectively earned 99 national tournament appearances, 34 WHAC regular season championships, and 17 WHAC tournament championships. Individually, the university has produced 451 All-Americans, 308 Daktronics NAIA Scholar-Athletes, and 32 NAIA Individual National Champions.

===Esports===
In August 2016, Indiana Tech announced the launch of a varsity eSports program that began competition during the fall 2017 academic year. The program competes in the National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE), of which Indiana Tech is a founding member.
Indiana Tech has eSports teams for four games: Overwatch, League of Legends, Rocket League, and Hearthstone. 

==Student life==
Indiana Tech has a variety of activities and organizations contributing to student life on campus, including many events organized each year through its office of Student Life. The main campus features a movie theater showing free weekly features; a performing arts theater for live performances; a rec center with a bowling alley, video gaming, pool and ping-pong tables and more; an art gallery featuring three or four new exhibits each year; and two main dining facilities, including a cafe featuring Starbucks coffee in its new Academic Center, as well as a third option in the new Max&#x27;s Bistro, located in Summit Hall. Indiana Tech also regularly hosts outside performing arts groups and notable speakers from diverse backgrounds in education, business, public service, law and more.

<text>Concordance democracy is a type of governing / ruling a country that aims to involve as many different groups as possible (parties, associations, minorities, social groups) in the political process and to make decisions by reaching a consensus. In this respect, concordance democracy is a form of consensus democracy. The counter-model to concordance democracy is called competitive democracy or majority democracy.

In Swiss politics, the concordance system (German &quot;Konkordanzsystem&quot;) is the integration of the major political parties into the seven-member Federal Council.

The concordance system is based on two principles

*an arithmetic rule of proportionality: the Federal Council should be representative of the political forces of the country, that is, its composition should be similar to that of the Federal Assembly.
*a political rule of consensus: the government must reach a compromise, even though it is composed of antagonistic parties.

One of the reasons explaining the system, which also exists at the cantonal level, is the perceived &quot;threat&quot; of direct democracy, since a sizeable opposition could in principle &quot;paralyse&quot; the government by submitting too many referendum proposals.

The fact that the members of the government must reach common decisions and stand by them is referred to as the principle of collegiality (German &quot;Kollegialitätsprinzip&quot;), grounded in the Federal Constitution (art. 177 al.1). The members of the Federal Council are supposed to forgo party politics and promote a cooperative spirit among the members of the executive. They must defend the government&#x27;s official positions even if doing so goes against their personal views or those of their party.

==History==

In 1848 the new Federal Constitution made Switzerland a federation of States, and no longer a Confederation. It thus introduced an executive organ at the federal level, the Swiss Federal Council. The membership of the Federal Council has never been changed in its entirety, since there have always been partial elections of some of its members. Technically, Switzerland has always had the same stable and consensual government, in contrast to most western democracies, which see regular alternance between left and right major parties.
The concordance system started in 1891 with the election of Josef Zemp, a Christian Conservative, to the Federal Council, which had previously been composed entirely of Free Democrats. The fact that this led to a reduced opposition from outside the government has since been referred to by some Swiss political scientists as &quot;The Zemp effect&quot;.
From 1959 to 2003, the Federal Council comprised two Free Democrats, two Social Democrats, two Christian Democrats, and one member of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party, based on an unwritten rule known as the &quot;magic formula&quot;. Since 2003, however, the composition has changed to reflect the rise of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party.

:All find their comfort with old John O&#x27; Dreams
:All find their comfort with old John O&#x27; Dreams

:When sleep it comes the dreams come running clear [&quot;Alternate&quot;: Now as you sleep the dreams come winging clear]

<doc id="1046964" wikidata="Q312213" url="?curid=1046964" title="Actinomyces">
<text>Actinomyces is a genus of the Actinomycetia class of bacteria. They all are Gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic, growing best under anaerobic conditions. &quot;Actinomyces&quot; species may form endospores, and while individual bacteria are rod-shaped, &quot;Actinomyces&quot; colonies form fungus-like branched networks of hyphae. The aspect of these colonies initially led to the incorrect assumption that the organism was a fungus and to the name &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, &quot;ray fungus&quot; (from Greek , ray or beam, and , fungus).

&quot;Actinomyces&quot; species are , occurring in soil and in the microbiota of animals, including the human microbiota. They are known for the important role they play in soil ecology; they produce a number of enzymes that help degrade organic plant material, lignin, and chitin. Thus, their presence is important in the formation of compost. Certain species are commensal in the skin flora, oral flora, gut flora, and vaginal flora of humans and livestock. They are also known for causing diseases in humans and livestock, usually when they opportunistically gain access to the body&#x27;s interior through wounds. As with other opportunistic infections, people with immunodeficiency are at higher risk. In all of the preceding traits and in their branching filament formation, they bear similarities to &quot;Nocardia&quot;.

Like various other anaerobes, &quot;Actinomyces&quot; species are fastidious, thus not easy to culture and isolate. Clinical laboratories do culture and isolate them, but a negative result does not rule out infection, because it may be due simply to reluctance to grow &quot;in vitro&quot;.

== Genomics ==
Phylogenetic trees based on 16S ribosomal RNA (16SrRNA) sequences have shown that the genus &quot;Actinomyces&quot; is quite diverse, exhibiting polyphyletic branching into several clusters. The genera &quot;Actinomyces&quot; and &quot;Mobiluncus&quot; form a monophyletic clade in a phylogenetic tree constructed using RpoB, RpoC, and DNA gyrase B protein sequences. This clade is also strongly supported by a conserved signature indel consisting of a three-amino-acid insertion in isoleucine tRNA synthetase found only in the species of the genera &quot;Actinomyces&quot; and &quot;Mobiluncus&quot;.

== Pathology ==
Actinomycota are normally present in the gingiva, and are the most common cause of infection in dental procedures and oral abscesses. Many &quot;Actinomyces&quot; species are opportunistic pathogens of humans and other mammals, particularly in the oral cavity. In rare cases, these bacteria can cause actinomycosis, a disease characterized by the formation of abscesses in the mouth, lungs, or the gastrointestinal tract. Actinomycosis is most frequently caused by &quot;A. israelii&quot;, which may also cause endocarditis, though the resulting symptoms may be similar to those resulting from infections by other bacterial species. &quot;Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans&quot; has been identified as being of note in periodontal disease, especially aggressive and localized form.

The genus is typically the cause of oral-cervicofacial disease. It is characterized by a painless &quot;lumpy jaw&quot;. Lymphadenopathy is uncommon in this form of the disease. Another form of actinomycosis is thoracic disease, which is often misdiagnosed as a neoplasm, as it forms a mass that extends to the chest wall. It arises from aspiration of organisms from the oropharynx. Symptoms include chest pain, fever, and weight loss. Abdominal disease is another manifestation of actinomycosis. This can lead to a sinus tract that drains to the abdominal wall or the perianal area. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss. &quot;Actinomyces&quot; species have also been shown to infect the central nervous system in a dog &quot;without history or evidence of previous trauma or other organ involvement.&quot;

Pelvic actinomycosis is a rare but proven complication of use of intrauterine devices. In extreme cases, pelvic abscesses might develop. Treatment of pelvic actinomycosis associated with intrauterine devices involves removal of the device and antibiotic treatment.

== Diagnosis ==
Actinomycosis may be considered when a patient has chronic progression of disease across tissue planes that is mass-like at times, sinus tract development that may heal and recur, and refractory infection after a typical course of antibiotics.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for actinomycosis consists of antibiotics such as penicillin or amoxicillin for 5 to 12 months, as well as surgery if the disease is extensive.

<text>American Hero is a 1993 satirical conspiracy novel, reissued as Wag the Dog: A Novel in 2004, written by Larry Beinhart. It speculates that Operation Desert Storm had been scripted and choreographed as a ploy to get George H. W. Bush reelected to a second term (taking cues from Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s similar war in the Falkland Islands), while at the same time analyzing exactly why that conflict had been so popular. The book formed the inspiration and basis for the 1997 film, &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;.

== Plot ==
On his death bed, Lee Atwater devises a plan to secure president George H. W. Bush&#x27;s reelection by having a war professionally produced by Hollywood agent David Hartman. 

The plan is set in motion after Atwater&#x27;s death, and Hartman hires movie director John Lincoln Beagle to produce the fake war. Beagle cancels other film projects to be able to prioritize the production of the war, among them one with movie star Magdalena Lazlo, who hires private investigator Joe Broz to find out why her film was cancelled. Broz, who works for the Los Angeles branch of the large private security company Universal Security (U.Sec.), first moves in with Lazlo as her chauffeur/bodyguard to perform background investigation. When he discovers that Lazlo&#x27;s house has been bugged by U.Sec., the two stage a simulated love affair to confuse their observers. As part of this cover story, Broz pretends to have taken over as Lazlo&#x27;s agent, a social ascent that gives him better access to the people that might be behind what the two assume to be a conspiracy against Lazlo. 

Meanwhile, Beagle has brainstormed possible war scenarios and has decided to produce a remake of World War II dubbed &quot;WWII--the video.&quot; The situation escalates when an aide to Beagle, an aspiring script writer, contacts Broz with a script for Lazlo and when U.Sec., assuming that the aide wants to leak details about Beagle&#x27;s secret project, steps in and kills the writer. Lazlo and Broz, together with the latter&#x27;s ex-Marine friends finally begin to understand the background situation better and manage to steal a memo from Beagle outlining the project. In return, U.Sec. kidnaps Lazlo and trades her for the memo. 

After a martial arts showdown, all parties agree to a truce, but at a film event in Mexico, U.Sec. decides to act unilaterally, killing Lazlo and a stranger they mistake for Broz. The detective, heartbroken, then turns to drinking and eventually knocks at a fictional author&#x27;s door to tell his story.

==Editions==

The story’s final plot element is present only in some editions of the novel, and is omitted from individual translations.

== Reception ==
===Reviews===
Reviews focused mostly on the plot and were mixed. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James called the book &quot;surprisingly flat&quot;, whereas Richard Eder in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised it as a &quot;funny, ingenious and outrageous political thriller&quot;.

===Critique===
The novel has received only limited critical attention. It is featured in depth in a chapter in Stacy Olster&#x27;s &quot;The Trash Phenomenon&quot; and in several academic publications by Sebastian M. Herrmann. Olster reads the novel in the context of postmodern cultural recycling and as commentary on a cultural shift away from text, stating, &quot;For Beinhart, &#x27;images have now replaced words as repositories of history&#x27; leading to a situation in which &#x27;changes of history can be achieved by changes in imagery&#x27;.&quot; Herrmann lauds the novel&#x27;s postmodern quality and its &quot;diegetic and narrative games&quot; and reads its central concern with the manipulation of political reality as indicative of an &quot;epistemic panic&quot; and, in consequence, as indicative of early forms of post-truth politics.

<text>The Blue John Cavern is one of the four show caves in Castleton, Derbyshire, England. The others are Peak Cavern, Treak Cliff Cavern and Speedwell Cavern.

==Description==

The cavern takes its name from the semi-precious mineral Blue John, which is still mined in small amounts outside the tourist season and made locally into jewellery. The deposit itself is about 250 million years old. 

The miners who work the remaining seams are also the guides for underground public tours. The eight working seams are known as Twelve Vein, Old Dining Room, Bull Beef, New Dining Room, Five Vein, Organ Room, New Cavern and Landscape.

In 1865, Blue John Cavern was the site of the first use of magnesium to light a photograph underground. It was taken by Manchester photographer Alfred Brothers.

==Blue John==
In the UK Blue John, or &quot;Derbyshire Spar&quot;, is found only in Blue John Cavern and the nearby Treak Cliff Cavern. It is a type of banded fluorite. The most common explanation for the name is that it derives from the French &quot;bleu-jaune&quot;, meaning &#x27;blue-yellow&#x27;, but other derivations have been suggested.
